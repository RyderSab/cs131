US	49741770	R33BM8XDZUI80A	0844713031	971846649	The social impact of the revolution (Distinguished lecture series on the Bicentennial)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Radicalism, the heart of the American Revolution	In this obscure pamphlet written by libertarian Robert Nisbet, one can find the heart of the American Revolution. Nisbet, in rejection of the \\"consensus\\" and conservative view looks at the radical social changes brought about by the American Revolution. <br /> <br />This lecture which was given at the bicentennial at the American Enterprise Institute in 1976 is a treasure. Nisbet begins by relating that many historians miss the radicalism of the American Revolution because they are too foucused on it's lack of extreme violence like in the Russian and French Revolutions. Nisbet correctly points out the massive changes brought about by the Revolution of 1776. The Revolution was not only a political and liberating event, but a social one too. <br /> <br />Nisbet outlines the abolition of primogeniture and entail by the thirteen states, and how radical this concept was. He also points out that feudalism did exist in the colonies, although weaker than in Europe, it nevertheless existed. Large landed estates were possessed by the colonial elite, many of whom became Tories and opponents of the Revolution. Nisbet also shows how the wholesale confiscation of Tory estates and the selling of such land to small landholders broke cycle of feudalism and aristocracy. <br /> <br /> Religious freedom and the disestablishment of state churches also contributed to the radical upheaval of society. This disestablishment caused a greater zeal for religion and also caused Americans to view religion as a separate entity from government, furthering the cause of secular power separate from religion. One of the most importatant is the American tradition of voluntary associations. Although the colonies share this tradition it is really the American Revolution that brought this liberal concept into being. Voluntary associations now flourish in the United States, a consquence of the Revolution.  <br /> <br />Overall, a great little book, and one that brings the social revolution in America to light.	2005-09-21
US	49741770	R35MPPMGMYVFKE	0679736883	443101004	The Radicalism of the American Revolution	Books	5	49	55	N	N	Radicalism, American Style	Gordon Wood's \\"Radicalism of the American Revolution\\" is truly an eye opening and long overdue study of the true radical nature of the American Revolution. Wood shatters the myths perpetrated by the conservative \\"consensus\\" historians that the American Revolution was \\"conservative\\" and \\"mild\\". <br /> <br />Wood shows that America, even in colonial times, was quite different from the rest of the Western world of kings, nobles and priests. Sure, Americans were governed by a herediatary monarchy and it's sycophants and minions, but that rule was shaky at best. This shaky rule was further weakened by the lack of a nobility residing in the colonies. Yes, there was an aristocracy, but they were not nearly as powerful as in Europe. <br /> <br />Wood begins by laying out the foundations of the colonial governments and society. He points out that the American colonists were contentious, and sensitive to any infringments on their liberty. He also brings to light the beginnings of a market economy, which began to liberate Americans from their mercantilist and elitist economic elites.  <br /> <br />The American Revolution literally brought ordinary people into government. This did not happen overnight, but the concept of \\"gentlemen\\" ruling a society as the masses meekly submitted gave way to the forces of classical liberalism and democracy. <br /> <br />The Revolution caused an upheaval in all areas of American life: religion, slavery, commerce, government, voter sufferage, <br />and family relationships.  <br /> <br />Americans no longer saw themselves as living for the ideal of \\"virtue\\" and in subservience to their \\"betters\\", but saw individual freedom and economic prosperity as an end in and of itself. Private life became separated from public life and people pursuing their own interest was soon seen as an ideal that was good for society.  <br /> <br />Wood correctly relays to the reader the radicalism of the American Revolution as extending beyond the dreams of it's Founders and an expansion of the ideals of the Revolution to all areas of society. This is what makes the American Revolution more radical than the French or Russian Revolutions. Both of those revolutions ended in despotism, while America, with all of it's flaws, ended with giving more liberty to it's citizens. The creation of private reform, and other associations and socities was unheard of in Old Europe. Groups opposing slavery, and for a wider sufferage blossomed and Americans joined private groups with an avidity unseen in despotic nations. <br /> <br />One reviewer, John Chuckman, seems to hate the American Revolution and believes America is a racist, and non-revolutionary nation. This is, of course a leftist view of America which unfortunately too many people buy into. Don't believe such nonsense. Instead pick up this book and see the radicalism of the American Revolution first hand. You will not be disappointed.	2005-09-16

Books	5	2	2	N	N	The American Revolution as a radical movement	The American Revolution by Jack Hardy is a great short history of the American Revolution prior to the war. Hardy, although a Marxist, correctly outlines the radicalism of the American Revolution. Hardy begins with the Stamp Act crisis and takes the reader right up to the beginning of the War of Independence. <br /> <br />Hardy reviews the history of the radical committees of safety, and correspondence. He shows how these radical committees directed and whipped the common people into a frenzy against the oppression of the British Parliament and Crown. Hardy goes to the core of the Revolution: freedom from economic and social oppression. He reveals the radicalism of the revolution by going over the following events: <br /> <br />The suppression of the Tories by radical committees <br />The implementation of nonimportation and nonexportation agreements, along with nonconsumption pledges. <br />The total overthrow of British authority in American and the creation of radical extralegal government <br />The use of violence by revolutionaries and the people against British officials and property ( the Tea in Boston Harbor and the Gaspee in Rhode Island) <br />The establishment of new governments and radical constitutions to provide protection to the rights of the people <br />The use of new theories beyond the conservative arguements of consitutional violations by the propagating of the natural rights of all men <br /> <br />These are just a few examples of how the American Revolutionaries used a radcial new philosophy to overthrow British authority and create a republic from it's ashes. <br /> <br />Overall a great read.	2005-09-01

Rothbard chronicles the events that make up America. He starts in volume one by carefully outlining and detailing the founding of the British colonies in North America from Jamestown to the Glorious Revolution in Britian. Rothbard masterfully points out how the wide open and easy availablity of land enabled the colonists to become a new kind of man- a man of freedom and independence. The colonists did suffer under tyranny during this period, from Puritan Massachusetts with it's theocracy to the tyranny of the corporation that ran the Virginia colony, Rothbard lays out a complete history of the colonial founding. <br /> <br />In volume two it is shown how the \\"salutary neglect\\" of the British government allowed the colonies to develop not only independent trade, but their own self government. During this period the colonies were virtually self governing due to a combination of the wars Britian fought in Europe and the ruling British elites' contempt for the colonists. The colonists developed a sense of not only being \\"Englishmen\\", but citizens of their own colonies. Also a nascent American nationalism began to develop along with a contempt for the corruption in Britian and it's aristocracy. <br /> <br />Volume three is, in my humble opnion, the very best of the four volumes. It is in this volume in which Rothbard shows the radicalism as the real American Revolution began with the Stamp Act in 1764 and culminating in the Declaration of Independence. Because of this, I believe this to be the most important volume. <br />Rothbard begins by showing the colonial opposition to the centralizing tendancies of the British government. First, the outrage against the Stamp Act which the colonists saw as unconstitutional and passed to \\"enslave\\" them. Next, we have the Townshend duties which the colonists, led by such radical patriots like Samuel Adams, saw as unconstitutionally regulating their trade. These unconstitutional acts were \\"nullified\\" by the colonies in harsh and strong language. Colonies denounced the acts and passed resolutions declaring the acts void. The populace and governments of the colonies then refused to enforce the acts. Colonial officials were threatened, and warned not to violate the liberty of their constitutents. Eventually the colonial governments were literally overthrown and royal government ended. <br /> <br />During this period, Rothbard points out how the colonists drank deeply in the cup of Enlightenment philosophy. Rousseau, Voltaire, Locke, the English Levellers, Sidney and the Roman and Greek philosophers were the base of the new emerging libertarian philosophy. Rothbard, without directly stating it, totally refutes the lies of the Religious Right about the Founders being \\"born again\\" Christians, and the loony Left's assertion about a \\"conservative\\" revolution. Both views are false. Instead you see a new nation rising out of the ashes of the Old World. A new nation based upon the liberalizing effects of the Enlightenment. Freedom of speech, religion, person etc were supported and written into the new revolutionary constitutions and liberal ideals of equality under the law, and free trade were beginning to flourish. <br /> <br />The fourth volume is quite good. Rothbard details the military portion of the Revolution with the consequent upheaval of society in the new American States. Committees of Public Safety. Correspondence, etc became the de-facto governments after the fall of British authority.  These committees were, in many cases, popularly elected and supported. The committees used coercive and aggressive methods against \\"Tories\\" by confiscating property, banishment, and sometimes outright violence; further refuting the view that it was a \\"conservative\\", and \\"consensus\\" oriented revolution. <br /> <br />Rothbard brings us to the end of the war and deliniates the \\"liberating\\" effects of the Revolution. Thegradual elimination of slavery in many colonies, the ending of religious qualifications for public office, the equalizing of property by the natural effects of having vast open land, the purchase of Tory estates at small prices and the gradual, but eventual melting away of the class oriented society of Britian. <br /> <br />These volumes are a treasure, and should be read and re-read. Rothbard will scare both right and left by this history. He thoroughly destroys the \\"conservative\\" and \\"consensus\\" historical view, and leaves the leftist interpretation to rot in it's own rhetoric. He also refutes the view of the modern court historians by showing the colonies to be independent entities, with their own self governing societies. He correctly shows how the American Revolution was a massive social, political and philosophical revolution. He will scare the daylights out of modern Federalists by showing how colonial legislatures opposed, refuted and literally nullified British authority in America. They passed resolutions directly opposing the authority of the central government. He proves that the opposition to strong central government started not in the Civil War, or in Jefferson's masterful Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, but during the American Revolution. He proves that opposition to centralized government is as American as hot dogs and apple pie.  <br /> <br />If you love history,liberty, and freedom, buy this set! You won't be sorry!	2005-08-21

Thayer lays out in detail the growth of democratic and libertarian thought in Pennsylvania in the days preceding independence. He shows the fierce battles betwen Benjamin Franklin and the Penns, who were the proprietors of the colony. Thayer lays out the battle in the Pennsylvania Assembly between the \\"Quaker Party\\", and the \\"Presbyterian Party\\" for control of the government. Also Pennsylvania is shown as a tolerant , somewhat diverse colony. Germans, Swedes, Irish, Scotch and some French Hugenots pervaded the colony. All of these groups shared diffrent religious views such as Moravians, Presbyterians, Quakers, Anabaptists, Anglicans, and even some Roman Catholics. <br /> <br />Thayer shows how this conservative colony became a hotbed of radicalism and by 1776 had overthrown the established government and implemented a radical revolutionary constiution. This constitution was a radical document supporting the natural rights of human beings, the right to property, the abolition of most property qualifications for public office, religious tolerance, free speech, and a unicameral assembly. Artisans and mechanics like George Bryan, Thomas Paine, Timothy Matlack, and Charles Thomson came to force during this time and overthrew the colonial assembly and instituted a revolutionary government in it's place. Overall, a great book.	2005-02-26

Bailyn gets to the heart of the radicalism of the American Revolution: a deep suspicion of government power, particularly centralizing power.  <br /> <br />I also must agree with reviewer Ken Riley about the non-influence of Christianity in revolutionary thought. Bailyn shows the the Enlightenment influence of Locke, Montesquieu, Algernon Sidney, Harrington, and even Rousseau. The attempt of fundamentalist Christians to portray the Founders as evangelicals and the Revolution as a Christian revival is both dishonest and criminal. This book was written long before such right-wing nonsense became popular. The American Revolution was an Enlightenment revolution and the most radical of all modern revolutions. Bailyn clearly shows the ideological ideals as one of liberty, freedom, suspicion of all government power, the ancient rights of Englishmen, and the sovereignty of the people. <br /> <br />These rights are traced back to ancient Roman law, Anglo-Saxon law,and as stated by another reviewer Danelaw. Nowhere are there references to the book of Exodus,Deuteronomy. or Leviticus as the source of anglo american philosophy. Conservative and religious fanatics who peddle their version of history are either lying or totally ignorant of the truth. Bailyn smashes all of these false theories and presents the origins of the Revolution in all it's glory.	2005-02-21

Kirk, A right wing fanatic who admires monarchy and aristocracy, loves Randolph for the  same  reasons. Randolph, although an eloqent and passionate defender of state's rights, was an enemy of the Jeffersonians, and an unwitting ally of his Federalist enemies. Randolph was orginally a liberal, but soon became a defender of what Murray Rothbard calls the \\"Old Order\\". The Old Order mindset is one of a monied aristocracy, powerful political leaders, dominating religious leaders, and fuedalism, all of which Randolph admired. <br /> <br />All of this tells much about Kirk himself, as most biographies do. Kirk is an enemy of Jeffersonian democracy and limited government, even though Randolph supported a limited federal structure. Kirk, an admirer of Burke, along with Randolph, seems to endorse the view that people need an aristocracy to run their lives. Randolph believed those ideals too. He believed in primogeniture, entail, a strongly restricted franchise, and the power of landed wealth. Primogenture, entail, disestablishment of a state religion were the linchpin of a Jeffersonian reform of Virginia. Randolph despised these changes. Kirk, seems to despise them also. It seems to me that men like Kirk and Randolph would have been Tories in the American Revolution, both admired England, it aristocracy and it's powerful government. Old John Randolph, the aristocrat and state's rights man, and Russell Kirk, the monarchist and conservative couldn't be better bedfellows. The only good point is that Kirk points out that Randolph opposed slavery but realized that simple manumission would be futile in his society. After Randolph's death he deeded a large tract of land to his slaves in Ohio and freed them. When they tried to settle the land they were run off by the white population. This should answer the moronic comments by leftists who rail at the Founding generation and continually cant that they should have just \\"freed\\" their slaves, the consequences be what they may. <br /> <br />Other than that Kirk shows why the modern conservative movement, of which he is credited as it's founder, is anti-liberty and pines for a return to the \\"Old Order\\". <br /> <br />Overall a poor study with much bias.	2005-02-20

Wheelan, like most American historians of our bizaare conservative/big government era, continually roll out hit pieces on Jefferson. Jefferson is painted as \\"vindictive\\", an \\"opportunist\\", and as the title relates with a \\"vendetta\\".<br /><br />If anyone was an opportunist it was Aaron Burr, a man of no real principles accept the aquisition of power. Burr wanted his empire in the west and Mexico and conspired with the British government for aid. It is typical of today's history to exault a scoundrel like Burr or a rabid Federalist like Marshall instead of a man like Jefferson. Jefferson was not a flawless man, as no man that has existed has ever been. He was, however, a very principled and devout defender and believer in republcian government. The American History \\"profession\\" is one of the most morally bankrupt and biased \\"professions\\" of our era. Most are ardent leftists, or right wing \\"conservatives\\". The leftists hate Jefferson and his ideals, which also were ideals of the American Revolution: sovereignty of the people, individual liberty, limited government, and a written constitution. So called \\"conservatives\\" dislike Jefferson because they are normally enemies of progress, human rights, and liberty, exaulting the state over all else. An Edmund Burke/ Russell Kirk ideal. Leftists also exault the state in their desire to enforce \\"equality\\", \\"civil rights\\", and \\"fairness\\". Mr. Wheelan is a typical \\"court historian\\" if you may. Jefferson must be brought down in the modern era of big government, high taxes and huge public debt, things he vehemently opposed.<br /><br />The elevation of Burr, a man who the Federalist Alexander Hamilton called a \\"Cataline\\" and an\\" embryo Caesar\\" is sign of the future slander of not only Jefferson, but other pro-liberty founders.<br /><br />In our conservative age look at the bios coming out: Alexander Hamiltion, John Jay, George Washington, all Federalists. as with Hamilton and Jay \\"revisionist\\" biographies, meaning hiding their toryism and anti-liberty ideals. Burr neither a Federalist or republican, but a opportunist and scoundral, is treated well by Mr. Wheelan, the court historian.<br /><br />Overall another bio-slander hit piece on Jefferson.	2005-02-20

Locke, an English freethinker, wrote both his Frist and Second Treatise on Government to refute the patriarchial and absolutist writings of Sir Robert Filmer. Locke clearly believes man is imbued with the natural right to life, liberty, and property. He believes men have a right to live free from tyrannical government.<br /><br />Locke shows how when a government degenerates into tyranny the \\"people\\" have a right to revolt and throw off such government. Sound familar? Jefferson wrote these words into the Declaration of Independence. Locke believes that liberty is a man's right by his very nature of being human. He points out how that men come together to form a government, based upon a social contract, and that the rulers or government must abide by that contract or man returns to his natural state. In the natural state men are not bound to the current ruler but may institute new government for their security and protection.<br /><br />Although he believed that government should not be changed lightly or on a whim, and believed that the ruler must violate the contract and usurp power, he nevertheless pointed out that government is of men, not God or gods. He repudiated the doctrine propagated by Filmer, that rulers are appointed to rule by God, ie: the Divine Right of Kings.<br /><br />This \\"wee little book\\" as Jefferson put it, has had a tremendous influence on the Western world. Locke, a child of the English Enlightenment has caused conservatives and other tyrants, socialists and communists to shudder at the right to throw off tyrannical government.

John Taylor, a devout Jeffersonian, wrote this treatise to refute the monarchial ideas of John Adams as espoused in his \\"Defence of the Constitutions of the United States\\".  <br /> <br />Taylor lays waste to Adams and other conservatives ideas that there must be a balance of orders among men in society and government. Taylor rejects the forms of the English government, lords, commons and king, and instead embraces the sovereignty of the people through a written constitution and republican government. Pointed out are the moral principles of republican government as embodied in the American Revolution, which Taylor considers as an epochial event which changed the way men viewed government. Taylor believes good government is nurtured by good principles at the foundation of a government. He rejects the ideals of fraud, force, and coercion to govern men, which Adams, Hobbes and Sir Robert Filmer believe to be man in his natural state. Taylor believes men can live free if their form of government has good moral priciples infused throughout. These principles are a division of power between state and federal authority, the sovereignty of the people, and local and statewide self government. <br /> <br />Taylor also rejects the idea of strong central government as in the British model, especially before the American Revolution. He rejects a central bank and subsidies for private enterprise as destructive to the public good, a vehicle to corrupt government and centralize power. He believes these events will destroy the principles of the American Revolution. Taylor also takes umbrage at Adams glorification of aristocracy and monarchy as faulty and based on the corruption of the English system. <br /> <br />Although this book is difficult reading, due to Taylor's expansive and complex vocabulary, it is well worth a purchase to investigate the true principles of the American Republic and Revolution. All those interested in liberty, freedom and self government will enjoy this large volume. Set time aside in a quiet place without interuption to read this book. Read it slowly and over several months time and the full effect will be felt. <br /> <br />A great read.	2005-02-15

The press of the colonies was far from the lapdog establishment press of today.<br /><br />The patriot press began in 1764 with the Sugar Act castigating and attacking the English Parliment for their assumptions of power over the colonial legislatures.<br /><br />From 1764 to 1776 the press is shown in it's true glory. All of the tyrannical legislation passed by Parliament is attacked as \\" destroying the rights of Englishmen\\", and the \\"sovereignty of the people\\". These newspapers, the Massachusetts SPY, the Connecticut Courant, the Boston Gazette, and Evening Post, all raised the bar of public debate from a relatively small protest against taxes to an in depth and profound debate over the rights of men, religious and political liberty, and republican government.<br /><br />In this volume you will see a press which is not afraid to critisize their political leaders in the colonies and Great Britian.

These two libertarian thinkers break all the rules of their time. No tyrant is safe from their prose. The clergy, kings, religious fanatics, the Pope, corporations, etc are all under assault by this duo as they expound on the ideals of liberty. They frequently warn their fellow citizens not to put too much trust in their magistrates, king and other politicians. They continually warn that men who are entrusted with power always seek accumulate more and eventually rule over the people. <br /> <br />The clergy are especially assaulted for their support of tyrants, corruption and worldly power. Although there is anti-Catholic bias, the Protestant clergy does not escape their quill. <br />They point out that priests of all religions are usually the biggest supporters of worldly tyrants who allow the priests a preeminent place in the government.  <br /> <br />It is obvious why Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson had these writing in their libraries, and why they were read frequently during the American Revolution. <br /> <br />If you love freedom, freethought, and liberty you will not be disappointed in The English Libertarian Heritage.	2004-12-30

Bowers starts with the assumption of the Presidency of Andrew Johnson, a heroic but much maligned man in history. Johnson was a staunch Unionist and patriot, but he was also an avid believer in Jeffersonian government. He correctly saw the centralization of power by the Republican Party as dangerous to freedom. <br /> <br />Next Bowers delves into the \\"Radical Republicans\\" led by Thaddeus Stevens, a vicious fanatic and a man who despised white Southerners. Stevens, an ardent aboitionist and crusader for negro equality, hated the South and it's white population. He wanted \\"Reconstruction\\" to be as harsh and unforgiving as could be. Overall a true scoundrel. Next we see the abolitionist fanaticism of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. Sumner,as radical as Stevens also hated southern whites and was a fanatic for negro equality. Sumner, like all Radical Republicans, wanted immediate equality of the races, negro voting( even when most could not read or write), disenfanchisement of all whites, and Southern governments dominated by carpetbaggers and negroes. These carpetbaggers, along with negroes and southern \\"scalawags\\" plundered the South.  <br /> <br />Also exposed is the lunacy and fanaticism of the abolitionists. Beloved today, they were seen as a threat to southern whites and as proponents of a bloody race war. William Lloyd  Garrison, a modern hero, was Puritan of the worst stripe. He called the US Constitution a \\"covenant with death\\" and encouraged blacks to rise against the whites. Left out of modern histories of the era is the scandalous and sick call for extermination, not just of slaveholders, but of all southern whites. New England clergymen were the main culprits. This was borne out of religious fanaticism of the most extreme fundamentalist type: uncomprimising, violent, and hateful. <br /> <br />The phony politically motivated impeachment of Johnson, the military governing of the South, the bribery, corruption, and violence perpetrated on southern whites shows a time of disgrace and despotism. The instigating of race tensions and war by Republican governors, and their lies, and promises to freed slaves that they would give whites land to them caused innumerable tensions throughout the South. <br /> <br />Lastly the stolen election of 1876 where the votes of three states, Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina were manipulated causing the election of Rutherford B. Hayes. The Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden, won the popular vote by 260,000 votes and more than likely the real electoral votes. In order to make a comprimise the Republican Party ended Reconstruction,and pulled federal troops out of the South. <br /> <br />This is a very politically incorrect, but accurate history, unlike the deconstructionist and anti-southern histories of today. It also shows that the Republican Party began as a party of Big Government and looking at today, still is.  <br /> <br />Overall, a great read.	2004-08-07

Adams proves that the war was truly a tragedy for republican government and popular sovereignty. Abraham Lincoln, deified by the modern Republican Party and neo-conservatives, imposed martial law, arrested the entire legislature of Maryland, closed newspapers who disagreed with the war, suspended the writ of habeus corpus in violation of the Constitution, and allowed his generals to commit war crimes and atrocities on the Southern people. <br />  <br /> A often overlooked take on the abolitionists is put forward. This take is their religious fanaticism and call for servile race war. On presbyterian minister in the East called for slaves to exterminate &quot;men women and children&quot;. Adams shows how Great Britian and the South American nations all abolished slavery peacfully with compensation, but in America it was very different. The South, of course, was frightened by the talk of race war, and the abolitionists demand for immediate emancipation. <br />  <br /> Adams also examines the tyranny imposed on hte defeated South by the fanatical and vicious Radical Republicans. Military dictatorships, &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;, economic plunder, and disenfranchisement of white voters led to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and Jim Crow. <br />  <br /> If anyone wants a true review of secession, it is here also. Adams shows how secession was always an accepted American tradition. The thirteen colonies seceded from the British Empire, <br /> and the South asked for the same. Also shown is the voluntary nature of the union and how it was a compact of several states. This is shown by the words of Jefferson, Madison, William Rawle, John C.Calhoun, etc.  <br />  <br /> If you want to see the REAL Abraham Lincoln, the REAL causes of the war, and the true right of secession, this book will not disappoint you. <br />	2004-07-25

DiLorenzo refutes all of the foolish arguements of the Lincoln &quot;myth&quot; school. &quot;Father Abraham&quot; is seen as he should be: a corrupt, tyrannical despot coercing the South back into the Union.<br />DiLorenzo correctly shows how the United States was a voluntary union, pointing out that the states existed prior to the Union, contrary to modern view that the Union came first. DiLorenzo also points out the moral bankruptcy of modern Marxist historians and their agenda. Eric Foner, Garry Wills,et al, are shwon to be the statists that they are.<br />DiLorenzo correctly shows how the North, particularly the New England area, profited off the protectionist tariifs that fell on the South. He quotes extensively from Whigs and Republicans showing their devotion to Henry Clay's &quot;American System&quot;, a Hamiltonian Scheme to create a huge centralized government. Lincoln's 30 year political career was devoted to Big Government, protectionism, corporate welfare ( particularly for railroads) and bureaucracy.<br />As President Lincoln's tyranny hits the reader like a ton of bricks.He violated the Constitution in the following ways: executive suspension of the writ of habeus corpus, invasion without congressional approval, arrest of political opponents without trial, imposition of an income tax,and  occupation of several states, Maryland in particular. He had the entire legislature of Maryland arrested and placed the state under martial law.<br />Lincoln also suppoted the brutality of his &quot;Grand Army of the Republic&quot;. The tyranny of Sherman and Grant was endorsed by Lincoln. Bombardment of civilians, burning of towns, raping of white and black women by Union soliders, and installation of puppet governments in the vanquished states.<br />DiLorenzo also correctly exposes the Republican Party and Lincoln as descendants of the Federalist Party. They were proponents of strong centralized government, and did not trust the people. Jeffersonianism was repudiated and limited government was overthrown.<br />If anyone wants the true Lincoln, you cannot go wrong with DiLorenzo's book.	2004-07-14

Tracy completely refutes Montesquieu's theory that republican government must be small. He shows why republican government or &quot;representative democracy&quot;  as he calls it is the only form of government that preserves liberty. Tracy is the true 19th century classical liberal.<br />He believes in free trade and shows how trade is the lifeblood of liberty. He also refutes the ideals of the divine right of kings, absolute monarchy, and tyranny. He is an avid republican, and libertarian. He believes in the complete freedom of religion, press and person. This book was heartily endorsed by Thomas Jefferson, who translated it for the American audience.<br />Although sometimes difficult due to 18th/19 th century syntax, it is overall a great book.	2004-07-08

Browne lays out a precise and coherent blueprint for returning to the American ideal of individual liberty and freedom. Browne cogently points to how the rapid growth of the Federal government has led to more crime, danger from abroad, and the destruction of liberty in America.<br />Browne calls for reducing the Federal government to only it's constitutional functions enumerated in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution. He calls for abolition of the welfare state, a reaffirmation of the 9th and 10th amendments of the Constitution, and a return to Jefferson's maxim &quot;peace commerce and honset friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none&quot;. <br />Browne calls for freedom in health care by abolishing medicare, medicaid and other socialist programs. He also calls for the gradual abolition of Social Security by selling off Federal assests and replacing SS with private annuities.<br />This book is a snapshot of what a Libertarian administration would be like.

Watkins traces the conflict between the Federalist monocrats and the Jeffersonian republicans during the 1790's. Jefferson and Madison are shown in their true glory as liberatian defenders of the principles of the American Revolution, the &quot;spirit of 1776&quot; as Jefferson put it. As the Federalist Party began to institute tyrannical measures like the Sedition Act and Alien bill to cripple the Jeffersonians, Jefferson and Madison conceived of measures to defended the rights of the states and the people.<br />Watkins also goes into detail about the nature of the Federal government, the original intent of it's framers and the effect the Virginia and Kentucy Resolutions had on the Nullification dispute between South Carolina and the Federal government in 1832.

Jensen shatters the Federalists myths of \\"national government\\" and the Continental Congress inheriting the powers of the British Parliament.<br />Jensen details the beginnings of the federal union in 1774 with the collapse of the colonial governments and the meeting of the First Continental Congress in September 1774. It is shown how conservatives, primarily merchants, land speculators, and admirers of the British government, fought independence up until the very signing of the Declaration of Independence. Although they supported the colonial cause many were frightened by \\"republicans\\" and \\"democracy\\". Due to these fears they supported a strong central government similar to Britian.<br />The radicals, Richard Henry Lee, Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson,<br />Thomas Burke, and John Adams were avid supporters of Independence. The radicals also supported a weak central government dependent on the states for support and were unwilling to embrace a new national government. With some exceptions, most radicals were localist and democrats because they believed that through their  state governments self government would function best. The conservatives were fearful of local government and it's democratic tendencies. Many were also immersed in land speculation and did not like the participation of the \\"rabble\\" in politics.<br />Jensen takes the Articles from the debate in 1776 through ratification in 1781. One interesting aspect is how the eastern delegates,NY, Maryland,, Pennylvania, etc, were willing to cede the western land to Spain just to keep their region powerful at the expense of the farmers and artisans of the west. Men like Daniel St. Thomas Jenifer, John Jay, Samuel Chase, and John Dickenson were more interested in the land claims than the liberty of the western settlers.<br />Thomas Jefferson was the most farsighted concerning the west. he proposed Virginia retain title to her claims to be surrendered to Congress only if the land was made into \\"free and independent states\\" He also proposed a radical plan to \\"give land to those who would settle it\\" thereby attacking the root of land speculation.<br />Overall the Articles were not a \\"weak\\" government, nor were they ineffective as later Federalist propaganda states. They were the embodiment of the American Revolution, revolt against distant centralized authority and the sovereignty of the individual colonies against the centralized power of parliament. Overall a great history.	2003-07-21

Chittum, a retired special forces veteran and freedom fighter, paints a horrfiying, but probable future for the United States as a nation state.<br />Chittum starts out by asking the reader to figure out which &quot;tier&quot; you belong to in the new order. If you are a member of the white working class you will immediatly understand what Chittum means. The &quot;International Bureaucratic Elite&quot; are the ones destroying America and creating an empire for their own purposes,power and greed. To do this the white working class must be degraded to third class citizens. This will be done through &quot;racist affimative action&quot;,politcal correctness, and outright tyranny. Since whites are the economic and racial backbone of America, they must go.<br />Chittum further relates how illegal immigration, racial politics, and cowardly and devious politicians , are exploiting the ethnic tensions already present from &quot;multiculturalism&quot; The Mexican &quot;reconquista&quot; of the American Southwest is happening at lightning speed and within 20 years whites will no longer be the majority in those states. A revolution in Mexico is predicted within 15-20 years which will be a spark for a &quot;Aztlan republic&quot; and outright secession. Along with this will come a brutal race war between whites and blacks in the America south.<br />Chittum draws a map of new America showing the probable breakdown of the new ethnic nations: the Northwest and Midwest a white European nation, the South a black one, and the Southwest hispanic. He also describes how black and hispanic street gangs( the Gangster Disciples of Chicago 50,000 strong) will be the new ethnic militias along with white militias forming for self defense. He reccomends white Americans, when the time comes, form Committees of Correspondence with other white communities for self-defense and cooperation. He also advises any whites living in the South or Southwest to get their affairs in order and move out the Northwest before the shooting starts.<br />If this books sounds pessimistic, it is. It is also a warning to America and the International Elite who are creating the conditions for this race war: affirmative action, racial politics, blatant discrimination against the majority whites,<BR>destruction of the white working class, gun control, and the feudalisation of society through ethnic &quot;tiering&quot; and annhilation of the Bill of Rights. Chittum predicts this to begin about 2020 or so. He believes ethnic riots in Los Angeles or a city with a large black population during the summer will be the spark. The USA will degenerate into anarchy shortly after this as the Federal government seeks to regain order. Not a pretty picture.<br />This book is a warning, so prepare yourself.	2003-07-20

Books	5	20	21	N	N	The Real Revolution Explained	Merrill Jensen's monumental work &quot;The Founding of a Nation 1763-1776&quot; is incredible and detailed history of the real American Revolution. What I mean by that is, not the military campaigns or generals, but the events and people that made the revolution possible.<br />The work starts with America after the Seven Years War with France. Jensen shows how colonial opposition to British measures enacted by Parliament caused a &quot;constitutional crisis&quot; and a defense of what were tradiational &quot;English liberties&quot;. Jensen provides the motivations for the revolutionaries both conservative and radical. Conservatives wished for reconciliation right up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence and were led by able and well educated men. Dickenson, De Lancy, Governeuor Morris, Robert Morris, James Wilson, and others strove to stay within the Empire to protect their aristocracy from the &quot;rabble&quot;. Samuel Chase, Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, Dr. Thomas Young, Issac Sears, and other radicals opposed English tyranny and brought the &quot;people&quot; to the forefront of the crisis.<br />Jensen deliniates the Sugar Act, Stamp Act, Coercive Acts, Massachuetts Government Act, Tea Act, Declatory Act, and other English laws that violated the rights of the colonists and were the beginnings of a more centralized English authority in America. Jensen also provides a tremendous story of the the battles between the colonial governments, loyalists and the revolutionaries. He also aptly explains the battles between the radicals and conservative patriots in the colonies and the struggle for a more democratic America. overall a brilliant and comprehensive work of the the first magnitude. A great purchase for the layman interseted in this great Revolution.	2003-07-17

Mr. Brookhiser, a typical conservative, attempts to paint the hight priest of monarchial Federalism is a glowing light. Hamilton is not depicted as he really was: a brilliant, unscrupulous, arrogant, elitist nationalist who had no desire to ensure liberty for posterity. Hamilton's own writings show him to be an extreme nationalist,monarchist, and admirer of Great Britian.<br />Mr. Brookhiser glosses over Hamilton's dishonesty in crafting the Federalist Papers( in which he claimed total authorship, a complete lie). Hamilton claimed that the Constitution \\"limted government\\", and that the state's rights and powers would be preserved. These statements were total propaganda to the masses to reassure their concerns for their local governments.<br />Hamilton also proposed a UNLIMITED monarchy during the Constitutional Convention. A President and Senate for life, a weak house of representative, no power to overide executive vetos, the governors of the states appointed by the President, a powerful and absolute federal judiciary, and the power of war making located in the President and Senate. This was not an \\"American\\" plan, but a carbon copy of the rotten English government just overthrown. Hamilton called the people \\" a great beast\\" and stated they \\"seldom judge or determine right\\". He told George Washington during the Whiskey Rebellion that he had learned \\"to hold public opinion of no value\\".<br />This man was not a republican or a believer in liberty. He was a monarchist and defender of strong central government. He was not an \\"American\\" as Mr. Brookhiser relates but an enemy of republican government.	2003-07-07

Royce takes you from the Revolution to the ratification of the Constitution showing how the Articles of Confederation were totally destroyed. As pointed out by Royce this should be called a national, not federal government. The Constitution provides the framework for an unlimited government instead of a confederate republic.<br />Royce correctly shows Hamilton's designs for a all powerful, monarchial central government with which to submerge the states.<BR>Hamilton is shown in his true light as a tool for the merchant class, banks, corporations, and the ruling elite of the new republic. Along with other Federalists he is shown manipulating public opinion through scare tactics and propaganda. Standing against him were the anti-federalists, and Thomas Jefferson, a true votary of human liberty. <br />Although this book can be depressing it is a must read for a patriot.	2003-07-07

One of the few histories on the First American Legislature, it is a worthy addition to any collection of the era.

What is really nice is that Montross does not share the antipathy towards the Articles of Confederation, and it's unicameral legislature that pervade the American &quot;civil religion&quot; today.<br />Congress is seen managing foreign affairs, ratifying the 1783 peace treaty, implementing the Articles of Confederation, and passing legislation for foreign policy and affairs. He also includes the personalities, John Adams, Samuel Chase, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson,John Jay, and other less known, but significant figures. Overall a really good history.	2003-07-06

Using their writings Jensen shows how Hamilton, Sedgwick, Jay, De Lancy, and other conservatives retreated from their belief in the sovereignty of the people to rule by an intellectual elite. Also shown is the apostacy of John Adams, a radical in the Revolution, and how he came to wish for a British style constitution. Madison is also seen as the pessimistic Hobbsian checking and balancing the people and \\"factions\\".Jensen also shows how many of the most radical revolutionary leaders like Samuel Chase became ardent Tories and Federalists after the end of the war. Chase, a man who rabidly denounced British tyranny, became a Federal judge under Washington, and became a equally rabid persecuter of \\"jacobins\\". In the process he behaved very much like a \\"jacobin\\" by attempting to centralize federal power and annhilate the Federalists \\"enemies\\", the Jeffersonians.<br />Jensen also shows how many of these conservatives were reluctant revolutionaries who up to the end wished for reunion with Britian.

Although it is true that the \\"Nature's God\\" of the Declaration of Independence is not the god of the Bible, and that Jefferson was a Deist,is true overall this book is awful. The most telling feature of this book is Dershowitz's politically correct deconstructionist attack on the concept of natural rights and his assault on Thomas Jefferson.<br />Dershowitz ridicules the concept of people being born with inherent rights to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\". he believes rights are \\"man made\\" and have no sacred meaning. He trashed the Declaration's author in the typical modern bolshevik manner by applying the standards of the 21st century to the 18th. He clearly sets out to demolish natural law and the entire tradition of Anglo American libertarian ideals of which Thomas Jefferson was a subscriber. It is amazing that a man like Dershowitz can be so brazen and hypocritical in his evaluation of Jefferson. Dershowitz, critical of Jefferson on slavery, supports \\"torturing\\" terrorist suspects, and is a rabid supporter of Isreali despotism in the Middle East. <br />This book show how degenerate the entire history profession has become and how any evaluation of our Founding should be viewed with a jaundiced eye.

Although part of a three part study on the French Revolution this can stand by itself. Contrary to all of the conservative and Marxist interpretations on the Jacobins and their plan for a republic author Marc Bouloiseau provides an objective study of the sucsesses and failures of the Jacobin regime. He places the Terror on the context of 18th century France and shows how it was a result not only of paranoia and fear but of very real rebellions and plots againt the French Republic by it's enemies.<br />Also addressed is how the Nation Convention and Committee of Public Safety functioned during wartime, and the proposals for a new society that were put forward. The Jacobins are seen not as \\"proto-Stalinists\\" but as 18th century democrats and reformers. Public education, land reform, trade, the military,were all to be revamped for the republican state. Bouloiseau does nto excuse the Terror but places it where it belongs: in the context of a brutal war for the very survival of France, Overall a great study.	2003-06-18

Say Republican Revolutionary	Richard Whatmore's \\"Republicanism and the French Revolution: An Intellectual History of Jean Baptiste Say's Political Economy\\" ia a brilliant addition to the history of Say and the French Revolution. Whatmore reveals a side of Say unknown to most, his republicanism. <br />Say was a solider in the Revolutionary Army, and a fervent believer in the French Revolution. Not even the Terror changed his belief in the French republican experiment. Say, known for his liberal economic views, was also a defender and exponent of modern republicanism. Say believed that popular education, manners, virtue, and industry were necessary to a free republic.<br />Say was an opponent of feudalism, slavery, religious bigotry, and monarchy. He believed monarchy an absurd form of government and that aristocracy was immoral and corrupted men. An advocate of the common man, Say felt that commerce, free trade, and progressive taxation would free the lower classes from the grip of the Old Regime. He believed in the disestablishment of the Catholic Church as also necessary to a free republican order.<br />Say, although orginally a supporter of Napoleon, became a fervent opponent. He despised the despotism, reinstatment of the Church,and the creation of hierachical orders instituted by the Emperor. Say oppsed the imposition of the Bourbons in 1815 and was an opponent of the monarchy until his death in 1832.<br />Say was a remarkable man, an enlightened economist, and a staunch republican, deserving of our admiration today.

He also relates how the Revolution changed European society forever. His chapter on the US was very interesting. He shows how the &quot;democrats&quot; like Jefferson, Madison, and other republicans were avid supporters of the Revolution believing that republicanism everywhere depended on it's sucess. Overall an excellent study.	2003-06-04

Healy traces Jefferson's philosophy regarding education from his early days as a member of the Virginia Legislature to his creation of the University of Virginia near the end of his life. Healy relates Jefferson's thought on the importance of education to a free society and how only an educated populace can live free.<br />Healy tackles the divisive world of religion and public education by deliniating Jefferson's views. Jefferson did believe religion was compatable with education, but he did not believe education should be dominated by sectarian bigots. Jefferson eliminated religious teaching from the elementary school curriculum thinking children too young for such complex issues as religious dogma and tenets.<br />Jefferson was hostile not to religious belief, he himself believed in God, but was hostile to fanatical religious views which had inflicted hatred and fanaticism on the world. He believed school was for teaching the \\"illuminating\\" of the human mind, not indoctrinating with sectarian belief. <br />Mr Healy's book is a comprehensive study and worth the purchase.	2003-05-31

Say, a free market liberal, was an admirer of Adam Smith, but was also critical of his views on the Labor Theory of Value. Say, an ardent republican, and participator in the French Revolution, was also an admirer of Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson with whom he corresponded.<br />Say believes government policy should stimulate frugality, risk taking, and investment. Say provides a very complelling arguement against excessive regulation, unequal privilege, high taxes, and corporations. Say,although a free marketeer, does not see pure benevolence in corporations, he see them for what they are: chartered privelged companies with government favor. This favor imperils economic freedom and destroys individual risk taking. Say advocated the abolition of monopolies, trade restrictions, and subsidies to corporations.<br />Say also shows his Enlightenment ideals of public spirit and the diffusion of knowledge. He relates the proper role for government as the propmotion of public schools, academies, libraries, canals, roads , bridges and military defense. Say although a thorough liberatrian, was not a worshipper of social darwinism. Say feared huge concentrations of wealth, luxury, and privilege as destructive to a free economy and republcan values. <br />If you love freedom and republican government, this is a classic.	2003-05-28

This book by Conor Cruise O' Brien is a postmodernist/deconstructionist <BR>\\"history\\" if it can be even called that. O' Brien, a socialist and Burkean, claims Thomas Jefferson was \\"high on the wild gas of liberty\\" because he supported the cause of Revolutionary France against the armies of the monarchies of Europe. This book was written to destroy the American people's connection to their great tradition of liberty and republicanism. O' Brien compares Jefferson to the communist butcher Pol Pot because he supported the actions of the Jacobins in the \\" Reign of Terror\\". O' Brien of course leaves out the brutality of the ancien regime, and the murders and slaughter metted out by the \\"holy alliance\\". Jefferson did believe in dying for liberty, a concept abandoned today by most plugged in Americans. Next O' Brien relates Jefferson is the father of the KKK, the militia movement, and white supremecy. All utter nonsense. If you want a good history of Jefferson and the French Revolution this is not it.<br />This \\"history\\" is the type of nihlistic nonsense fed to the American populace. The state of public education today, with it's Marxist, and postmodern deconstructionist philospohy has led many gullible Americans to hate not only the memory of Thomas Jefferson, but the ideals of liberty itself. What is truly amazing is that as Jefferson is portrayed as a \\"racist\\" by O'Brien and other socialists, the founder of their ideology, Karl Marx was a violent racist. Marx called for the \\"elimination\\" of \\"reactionary\\" races and frequently gave his opinion that negroes were \\"inferior\\" and that slavs, gypsies and jews were people deserving of genocide.In his correspondence Marx frequently used the \\"N\\" word. Thomas Jefferson, by contrast never uttered such a thing. <br />Socialists like O'Brien are responsible for supporting the ideals and regimes that have murdered, tortured and imprisoned millions of human beings in the 20th century. Thomas Jefferson held several hundred slaves under his charge throughout his life. He was unable to free them due to the spirit of the times, the laws and his massive debt. Compare this humane and benevolent man ( as stated by his own slaves) to the monsters that people like O'Brien admire: Marx, Lenin, Stalin,Mao, et al.<br />How sad that morality only applies one way today.<br />To all who would read this trash keep in mind that many biographies tell you more about the author, than  the subject being written about.	2003-05-23

Sission shows the brutal philosophical battle between the Jeffersonian Republicans and the Federalists. Sission shatters the lie that Jefferson's election in 1800 resulted in no change. Sisson points out the distinct and deep differences between the centralizing, and consolidating beliefs of the Federalist Party with the libertarian, republican worldview of the Jeffersonians. Jefferson and Madison are shown in their full glory battling against the Jay Treaty, and more importantly the Alien and Sedition Acts. Also exposed is the tyrannical and aristocratical views of John Adams and Alexander Hamilton who attempted to bring the Alien and Sedition crises to violence. <br />Sisson's study also shows the bankruptcy of other modern \\"professional\\" historians. Most historians have difficulty seeing Jefferson's election as a \\"revolution\\". They will classify it as a change in parties, without recognizing that modern political parties were abhorred in that era. It is symptomatic of modern American historians to fail to realize the revolutionary spirit of not only 1776, but of Jefferson's \\"Revolution of 1800\\". Instead Jefferson is seen through the eyes of the bitter and arrogant Henry Adams as adopting the views of his opponents. Sisson shatters these myths.<br />The chapter on Jefferson's contoversial election is outstanding. All the machinations, horse trading, politcal intrigue, and partisan views are expounded on. Any serious history student or Jeffersonian will love this book!	2003-05-01

This work, Jefferson's only book, shows his powerful, brilliant mind at it's best. Jefferson shows the depth of his knowledge, not just on his own beautiful state, but on human nature itself. Some of the gems in this work are his views on education, advocating free public education for all, free government, advocating a revisal of the defective original Virginia Constitution.  His knowledge of slavery, and the Indian races before his eyes are from personal experience and observation. Although painted by the deconstuctionist left as a &quot;racist&quot; Jefferson was a dangerous radical to the Virginia gentry due to his advocacy of emacipation and deportation of slaves. His views on black inferiority are exaggerated since he placed them forth as a scientific hypothesis based on personal observation. Jefferson could not see a &quot;multicultural&quot; society in America made up of former masters and slaves with resentment and prejudice still in the hearts of both. Many of his predictions about race relations have come true: hate, resentment, power struggles, and a continuing obsession which he forsaw would destroy the America Republic.<br />The best edited version of the is Koch and Peden's edited on in &quot;The Life and Selected Writings of Thomas Jefferson&quot;, but the full Notes is very good, but the reader must be prepared for numerous charts and tables.

Edited by Lloyd S. Kramer this small volume brings out the greatness of both Paine and Jefferson, in their own words. From Jefferson we have his &quot;Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot;, a document as radical and important as his other great work the Declaration of Independence. Also his &quot;Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom&quot; is fully documented, a awesome epistle to the right of free thought. Jefferson's letters to James Madison attacking the right of monarchs and generations to eat up the substance of future generations by large public debt. Jefferson's First Inaugural Address, a monumental statement on free government, is documented completely.<br />Thomas Paine's great works &quot;Common Sense&quot;, which spurred the fledgling colonies to independence, and his &quot;American Crisis&quot; articles were invaluable to the war effort. Next his &quot;Rights of Man&quot; , a brilliant and biting indictment of monarchy and aristocracy refuting Edmund Burke's earlier denuciation of the French Revolution. In Rights of Man Paine shows the idiocy and folly of hereditary government, and the oppressions it places on mankind. Paine is also the hearty exponent of republican government. He proposes a plan for a republican government in Great Britian, causing the English government to indict him for treason. Paine here shows himself the true advocate for republicanism and liberty. Overall a fantastic work. Anyone intersted in freedom and liberty should buy this small, beautiful volume.	2003-04-22

Starting with the life of Benjamin Franklin and his intellectual development to the his grandson's formation of the Philadelphia Aurora and battle for liberty in the 1790's this book holds your attention. Smith shows how Franklin developed an elightened philosophy of liberty, equality, and classical republicanism and instilled it into his grandson. Young Benjamin Bache became the epitomie of Franklinian ethics: hard working, educated in the classics, sincerely devoted to republican government,and with a streak of revulsion to injustice.<br />In the 1790's as the Federalists began develpoment of their centralizing theories,and their Hamiltonian ideals of \\"energetic\\" government, government by a plutocratic elite, and commercial develpoment, Benjamin Bache was aroused. A firm republican, his Aurora preached the values of agriculture, liberty and sovereignty of the people, support for the French Revolution, and support for democratic as opposed to aristocratic government. Bache was an avid supporter of Thomas Jefferson and his ideals of liberty and republicanism.<br />Persecuted by the Federalist under the tyrannical Alien and Sedition Laws Bache stood steadfast in support of freedom of the press and the First Amendment. His untimely death due to yellow fever deprived the Federalists of their victim, but brought attention to the cause of liberty. Inspired by the ideals of Franklin and Jefferson for a liberal and enlightened society Bache proposed reform of the US Constitution, opposed slavery, supported penal reform, and care of the poor.

Wiltse starts out with the intellectual background for Enlightenment thought in Great Britian and France. It is shown how the philosophy of republicanism and libertarian thought progressed from the mid 17th century to the time of Jefferson. <br />Next Jefferson's intellectual background is explored. Locke, Bacon, Newton, Sidney, and Lord Kames are shown to be the main influences on our greatest founder. It then moves to Jefferson's progressive philosophy of liberty and republican thought. Public education, religious freedom, the abolition of slavery, ending primogenture and entail, and a republican constitution consume the mind of Jefferson.<br />Wiltse also goes into Jefferson's philosophy for &quot;ward republics&quot;,a form of grass roots democracy. He details Jefferson's passion for ward republics to be the &quot;salvation of the republic&quot; as he called it. The main thing that makes this work so good id that it lacks the anti-intellectual postmodern &quot;deconstruction&quot; of Jefferson.

The comparison of the liberal/commercial views of James Madison with the radical democratic views of his close friend, Thomas Jefferson are truly enlightening. Matthews shows how Madison was closer to Hamilton than to Jefferson in political philosophy. Madison was obsessed with balance, and order in the liberal tradition. Jefferson,on the other hand, had a vision of radical democracy in the republic. Ward republics, and local democracy were infused into Jefferson's thought. Madison was more concerned with balancing the interests of society and controlling &quot;factions&quot;.  He viewed government from a more Hobbsian view than other Jeffersonians.Madison was far less trusting of human nature and more concerned with &quot;stability&quot; in society than with experiments in government. This book goes against the grain of current scholarship which unites Jefferson and Madison in philosophy when in fact in many ways they were poles apart. A great book.	2003-01-01

Jayne explores the Scottish Enlightenment and the religious liberalism of Lord Bolingbroke, a hero of Jefferson. Also Jayne shows how Jefferson's own religious liberalism influenced his philosophy behind the Declaration when he referred to \\"Nature's God\\". This was not Jehovah, but the God of Reason, and the Universe. Jayne shows the influence of the \\"moral sense\\" Scottish philosophy on Jefferson as he formulated a coherent philosophy of freedom, and religious liberty. It is also shown how Jefferson believed that religious tyranny to be the worst of all tyrannies since it crushed the freedom of thought. Jefferson, a tireless opponent of mental slavery, used the theological influences of Lord Bolingbroke to inaugurate the new nation. A great study.	2002-12-16

Wills rejects the traditional \\"Lockean\\" view and instead puts forward a different and, I believe, valid hypothesis. Wills finds the philosophy of the Declaration in Jefferson's reading of the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Francis Hutchenson, Thomas Reid, David Hume, and Lord Kames. These thinkers beleived, along with Jefferson, that man had an inate \\"moral sense\\" which man him human and governed the affairs of society. Wills book starts out slow when talking about the Decalrations beginnings, and the early Enlightenment influence, but picks up when he relates these thought to Jefferson.<br />Chapters 16 and 22 are particularly good since they deal with Jefferson's views on slavery. Wills correctly shows Jefferson always thought blacks fully human with a moral sense and integrity. Although he found their intelligence possibly below other races he never rejected their humanity nor their right \\"as a people\\" to be free. Chapter 22 show the fallacies behind modern critisism about simply \\"freeing\\" the slaves. Wills shows how unrealistic and quite impossible a wholesale emancipation in colonial Virginia would have been. Instead Jefferson wants freedom and education for the blacks, in their own nation, colinized to Africa where they could live free \\"as a people\\". Overall a great book.	2002-12-16

Bougin documents the active role forseen for the national government not just by it's major proponent Alexander Hamilton, but by Thomas Jefferson, and his Treasury Secratary Albert Gallatin. Jefferson's support for a national program for roads and a national transportation system are amply documented. Also Bougin digs up Jefferson's long lost plans for a national university and federal support for education. He shows how Gallatin and Jefferson paid down the national debt and recommended to Congress a plan to apply the surplus revenues to education, roads, and canals.

It is amazing to me how the first two reviewers show their how their own ideology ie: &quot;lockean liberalism&quot; is engrafted onto Jefferson. Matthews points out how Jefferson went farther than his fellow revolutionaries in creating a radical democratic philosophy. Jefferson was a true believer in not only a philosophy of liberty, but the best way to preserve that liberty through societal revolution, the &quot;earth belongs to the living&quot; concept, and his view of &quot;ward republicanism&quot;.<br />Jefferson saw the American Revolution as a fulfillment not only of Locke,and Sidney, but also saw it as a new begining for liberated man. This new begining would constantly renew the faith of the American Revolution through periodic change in laws and constitutions. Jefferson wanted to preserve liberty by extending democratic republicanism to virtually all white males through his granting of 50 acres of land to every man in Virginia in the belief that property ownership would secure the liberty fought for in the Revolution. Jefferson's proposals to abolish primogeniture and entail are radical attepts to equalize property relations by as he put it &quot; to put all on an equal footing&quot;. This was to increase propery ownership by allowing estates to be given to more than just the eldest son.<br />Next is Jefferson's &quot;ward republics&quot;. This proposal Jefferson saw as his most important. The ward would be the basic unit on democratic government. Similar to New England Townships, these wards would allow for participation in the affairs of society right down to it closest level. Public schools, militia duty, opposition to tyranny from other branches of government could all be begun here. He also included the &quot;care of the poor&quot; and &quot;care of the roads&quot;. This proposal I consider as one of his most profound of democratic ideals. <br />Matthews books is fantastic it illuminates these ideals in the freat Mr Jefferson. A great buy.	2002-12-08

By examining Thomas Jefferson's ward republics<BR>and their classical republican ideal we see how they could work for modern America. Jefferson's wards would be the focus of government for the everyday citizen. Care of the poor, militia duty, jury selection, and public education would be just a few of the duties of these &quot;little republics&quot;. Hart shows how Jefferson's wards could help restore civic participation by allowing the average citizen to be intimately involved with the basic duties of government that effect his or her life.

Taylor dissects the decision based on a Jeffersonian view of the delegated powers of the federal government in the U.S. Constitution. Taylor shows how the decision annhilates the taxing powers of the states within their own borders, and elevates the authority of the federal government above the states. Taylor is especially critical of Marshall's dictum that the federal government is &quot; supreme&quot; in it's &quot; sphere&quot;. Taylor rejects this view completely.Taylor maintains that the federal government is a government of delegated, limited powers, and that powers not delgated are reserved to the states. It is truly a brilliant states rights interpretation. He also reviews the Missouri Compromise. He shows the unconstitutionality of the Compromise and is prophetic on how it will lead to civil war. Other objects discussed are the ruinous effects of bounties to corporations and the creation of exclusive priviledges for the wealthy. Overall brilliant.	2002-06-16

Jefferson is often critisized by people who like a standing military and bureaucracy. Jefferson saw both as hostile to liberty and the Republic.

Taylor, the most articulate exponent of Jeffersonian Republicanism, is at his finest here. In New Views he refutes the doctrines of Madison and Hamilton in the Fedrealist which declare the United States to be a &quot; consolidated nation&quot; and having a supreme national government, instead of a federal one. He points out the contridictions of the authors of the Federalist, and de-mystifies it's hold on the interpretation of the Constitution. He also destroys the arguement that the Supreme Court has the exclusive right to &quot; interpret&quot; the Constitution and has the final word. He outlines a Jeffersonian view of limited government, and it's role in a federal republic. His predictions of civil war and geographical<BR>domination of one section of the union over the other are prophetic.

Miller goes through Hamilton's life from the West Indies to his death at the hands of Aaron Burr i 1804. Hamilton, a man of intense ambition and ego, emerges as a brilliant and flawed man. Hamilton was a proponent of strong central government, had no faith in ordinary people, and believed the wealthy were meant to rule. Miller brings out all of these views and provides good commentary. He outlines Hamilton's proposed government at the Constitutional Convention: an executive and senate appointed for life, the executive with an absolute veto, governors and judges appointed by the executive for life, with an absolute veto over their assemblies.

In this McDonald champions Hamilton, and ambitious,self centered,anti republican Founding Father. McDonald libels Thomas Jefferson, and attempts to degrade his views in the early American Republic by inflating the character of Hamilton. Hamilton, contrary to McDonald's belief was seriously anti-republican. In the Constitutional Convention Hamilton propsed an unlimited government based on the British monarchy. He was distrustful of common people even calling them &quot;a great beast&quot;. McDonald, like all admirers of Hamilton, attempts to gloss over Hamilton's anti-liberty and repblican ideals and instead elevate him as a defender of them.

Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces  aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;.	2001-05-20

Particularly good is chapter five by White McKenzie Wallenborn,MD,which shows how the TJMF prevented his dissenting committee report from being published with the majority report.
