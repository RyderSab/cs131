It  reminds one of a similar notion that Rome had for over 1,000+ years about  being the center of the world and the universe.

Above, there is a quote from the dictionary about the 2nd century AD. The reason for this thinking came from the 19th century when the scripture was finding it's way into Europe, becuase scholars saw it's message was so close to that of Jesus Christ's message, they erroneously assumed it was written AD. We have learned much about Indology since then. It was probably written circa 800 BC or earlier. Krishna lived in 3000 BC, and Hindus give him the same status that Christians do to Jesus.  If Jesus words seem so similar, and they do, this is further evidence of Jesus long stay in India with the Hindu Yogis during his missing years.<br />The Gita's symbology has been very skillfully explained by Paramahansa Yogananda in his Gita comentary &quot;God Talks With Arjuna&quot; .Anyone who enjoys the Gita's wisdom, will marvel at the inner meanings it can divulge....	1998-06-07

A great reference book for all those studying comparative religion. <br />The author, Ed Viswanathan, covers a great deal of subject matter on Hinduism, whose true name is the Sanatan Dharma ( the Everlasting Religion).<br />He shows great skill and understaning while keeping such a profound religion clear and well arranged. A reader can look up most subjects at a glance in the index. <br /> Mr Viswanathan shows the all encompassing inclusiveness of the world's oldest religion. He also shows many parallels between Christianity and Hinduisms great Scriptures. Hiduism is ideed blessed to have so many God-relized prophets both ancient and modern. The author effectively answers the many misconceptions other faiths have about Hinduism, and shows us that &quot;Brahman&quot;, the one true God that Hindus knew about, long , long before Abraham, has no limit to his manifestations. Hinduism's all encompassing nature makes room for all true prophets of all true religions, as well as for the great difference in human needs on the path of the spirit. <br />The author brings us right up to the present century with brief outlines of the great yoga systems that are now sweeping the modern world. This is no doubt one of India's greatest contributions to human civilization. The yogis of India perfected the ways to reach SELF-REALIZATION into a complete and flawless Science. Kriya Yoga was brought to the West by Paramahansa Yogananda who wrote the classic &quot;AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI&quot;, which has changed the lives of millions of people. He was able by his God centered life to show the west a living example of India's great saints and sages.<br />&quot;AM I A HINDU?&quot; will greatly help to break down the narrow views of many who find other religions so strange. The book presents an ideal setting, a caring father shares a lifetime of faith with his growing son. Hopefully many parents will follow this much needed example. Your children will have s! urely have a rich inheritance.	1998-06-06

Such precise use of the English language by a foreigner on spiritual material is remarkable.<br />These talks gave me understrandings that changed my outlook and my life. One can feel that His source of every word is truly from the Living experience of God's reality.  And the energy of divine light and love shines through it.This book deepened my Quietest moments.<br />Among the many areas dealt with in this book, the author has some serious ideas about world peace and brotherhood,&quot;We have everything necessary in the world today to bring about the millennium........A federation of all religions and all nations is necessary. But such a union will come only when every individual engages in that meditation which leads to direct contact with God&quot;. So Yogananda places great importance on the practice of MEDITATION in these talks, as well as how to live life more abundantly inevery way. <br /> His knowledge stands out in practical matters as diet also- here talks in the 20's and 30's he gives us ahead of time the accurate knowledge of proper diet that science has only recently (in the 90's)  been verifying from years of research. What was the source of his precise wisdom in all these matters??? Is this what comes from &quot;contact with God&quot;? The author proves the value of his own teaching in this and many other ways. I loved the originality and directness of the authors open and intelligent dealings in such a wide range of subjects...<br />CONTENTS:<br />How Seekers first found God.......................

In this small book, PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA clearly states a simple and profound truth that is the core philosophy of all of the world's great spiritual systems. As Douglas Ainslie says in his introduction &quot;this small book offers the clue to the universe....between these narrow covers is to be found the flower of the Vedas and the Upanishads, the essence of Patanjali,...and the thought of Shankara, greatest mind that ever dwelt in mortal body........This is the deliberate attempt of one who has at last found in the East, after many wanderings, the solution to the riddles of the world......The essential point to be remarked about Paramahansa's teaching,....is that it is not speculative , but practical, even when dealing with the utmost reaches of metaphysics.&quot;<br />The author was a great Yogi who lived and taught in the West for over 30 years. The example of his life and work have not only turned many people god-ward, but has also shown them the way to SELF-REALIZATION through Kriya Yoga and his prolific inspired teachings. His wisdom, insight and remarkable innovations in the field of human development and religion are legendary.The main theme of this book is &quot;bliss&quot;, our deepest need and how to find it.<br />Parmahansa Yogananda established the Self-Realization Fellowship as the sole authorized representative and spiritual path for his great work.<br />Also Recommended:<br /> AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI........SANCTUARY OF THE SOUL........THE DIVINE ROMANCE...............MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST..................JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION.....................WHISPERS FROM ETERNITY..................WHERE THERE IS LIGHT ....etc....all by the same author.	1998-05-09

Mr. Deckers unique experiences and very accurate reporting and research tell us the whole story.<br />The authors untiring efforts to make the truth known is a great service to humanity,and also of great service to members of the LDS church. Mr Decker has the courage to do what the leasership could not-be honest and open! To inform the many innocent listeners, in the face of unfounded missionary claims and the utter secrecy and unnacountability that are common to the Mormons. The author helps us to understand why such young and naive missionaries are sent out with little understanding about other religions, and often even their own-all at their own expense.<br />Joseph Smith and David Koresh (both deceased) were of the same mind, motives and behavior. There have been somany in religious history who desired to be Prophets, the proof lies in more than just numbers and talk. In the new Testamant Jesus gives us a long list  of the qualities of a true believer. The records of history are clear on this. The only difference btween them at present, is the LDS growth due to great American business know-how, and the LDS head start of over 170 years, not by the leaders example or life. Jesus said &quot;You will know them by their fruits&quot;. From it's conception the LDS church has never produced a soul like Jesus - Buddha and Krishna , or St Francis of Assisi, or Mahatma Gandhi. Unless they are keeping that a secret too! However, like many churches in America, the LDSchurch consists of many good people, sincere and devout followers, and a great sense of community.	1998-05-05

The author gives one a good overview of new age interests and tools,for absorbing reading. But one matter that was brought up on page 6, about the need for spiritual masters being a thing of the past - perhaps she has misunderstood the intent of  Yogananda's words. I have come to understand that  having a spiritual master is the most effective key to self-empowerment. That very reltionship made him what He is, and may be a major factor that has preserved Hiduism with such depth and vitality.  It is easy to sense Sooze's concern with this most critical area of ones personal growth. However, history is literally full of examples that all the Great Ones had gone through a serious training with a Guru. Rather than a limiting process, I see it as the key to the most effective progress one will ever know. The limited ego always loves to crow about its seeming ability to &quot;go it alone&quot;. Does it know when it is only going in circles? Truly, the greatest challenge for most people is &quot;Awakening to Change&quot;.	1998-04-30

Paramahansa Yogananda's recorded talks in &quot;THE DIVINE ROMANCE&quot;, presented to me the most comprehensive, balanced and inspirational view of spirituality and love I have seen in a long time. He must have been a great Bakti Yogi to have such deep vibrations of Divine Love pouring out of every page! <br />Yogananda's awareness of such a wide range of wisdom in these important life areas of          MEDITATION-PSYCHOLOGY-LOVE-PEOPLE-GOD-etc, and the balanced approach to the spiritual life shows an outstanding teaching ability as well. This is wonderful to see in writings on such subtle and profound matters. He takes the &quot;mystery&quot; out of the mystical. In this book one finds complete and sensible answers to sastisfy the mind and heart. It makes one greatful that such great souls still come to help us through our lives of difficult learning and growing. This book was difficult to put down, but I found that reading it slowly and  encouraged me to seek and feel the presence of God more and more deeply. Try it and you will know. As wonderful as reading can be, it took my consciousness to finer realms... <BR><br /> Also Recommended: Man's Eternal Quest...Journey to Self-Realization and Autobiography of a Yogi. <BR><br />CONTENTS:  <BR>How To Culitvate Divine Love  <BR>A Newlook at the origin and nature of Cosmic Creation  <BR>Practicing Religion Scientifically.  <BR>Finding the Joy in Life.  <BR>The End of the World.  <BR>The Why and How of Religion.  <BR>The Spectrum of Spiritual Consciousness.  <BR>The Mind:Repository of Infinite Power.  <BR>Why Evil is Part of Gods Creation.  <BR>The Mysery okf Mahatma Gandhi.  <BR>The Unknown Potential of Memory.  <BR>How to Work Without Fatigue.  <BR>Ridding the Consciousness of Worry.  <BR>The Yoga Art of Overcoming Death an Mortal Consciousness.  <BR>How Feelings Mask the Soul.  <BR>Where is Jesus Now and What is He Doing?  <BR>Do Souls Reincarnate?  <BR>Where are Our Departed Loved Ones?  <BR>Reflections on LOVE.  <BR>The Known and the Unknown.  <BR>Controlling Your Destiny.  <BR>!How to Free Yourself from Bad Habits. <BR>Oriental and Occidental Christianity.  <BR>A World Without Boundaries.  <BR>To Know God Is To Love All.  <BR>How You Can Approach God.  <BR>The Cosmic Lover.  <BR>Personal and Impersonal God.  <BR>Take God With you Through Life.  <BR>A Scripture of Love.  <BR> .........and others	1998-04-30
