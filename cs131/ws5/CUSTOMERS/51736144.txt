But  &quot;The Last Rangers&quot;  did come out around this time, and is a far better series.  TLR is superior to TNW in delivery of action sooner, and in the dry satirical asides its descriptive prose illustrates.  TNW's prose is bland and static.  I could get more interesting descriptive prose reading a Sears catalogue.  Read Deathlands, Outlanders and The Las Rangers for the best in satirical humor and action.	2003-01-30

This story is so old that Alfred Hitchcock would call it derivative.  Can't understand why this rotten old story was published.

I agree with all the points made with another reviewer who gave this novel two points.  Especially on how Andy portrays certain people in a sterotypically fashion.  However, I have a stronger dislike for novels written by liberals who use them as political platforms.  Seems history was trying to be rewritten here, and a sickly yearning back to the Days of Camelot were very much evident and not appreciated by this reader.  Overall this was a stupid and ignorant novel.	2002-10-23

I get a flavor, a whiff of a watered down mix, say of The Addams Family, plus the style of narration found in the late Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide To the Galaxy series.  But it is not a well blended mix.<br />If you're going to play at the satirical, you had better be slicker and stronger than what went before your work -- both elements of which are missing in this unfortunate series.<br />One thing is clear though: the author has not found his voice -- the characters are too wooden and the anachronistic blend of Victorian with Modern is not that artfully done.<br />In terms of the humor department, I find little humor in these books.  The humor there is is not sufficiently dry and ironic to really provide top notch entertainment, which is something I feel strongly these too high priced books lack.  The plots are not that ingenious.  Hell, there is just not enough sly wit in any of the first two books for me to say I really like the humor!  There is only one humorous line in any of the books, which is the author's monologue with his imaginary audience concerning his disclaimer that the book(s) are pleasant.  It is nice to know this, once.<br />Unfortunately, this too is spoiled rotten becasue we soon find the author nattering on about this fact repeatedly throughout the book -- apparently he is so enamoured (enameled is more like it!) with this particularly humorous bent that he feels it is vital to inject it (and us as well) with said disclaimer in at least three parts of each book!  Hey, I think kids will  &quot;get it&quot;  the first time they read it, no repeats, please!  We first notice the humorous disclaimer on the back cover, but then we also suddenly find it in the first chapter, then later on in the umpteenth chapter....  Ridiculous! <br />Overall I rate  &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;  a mediocre tale, filled with dull, ungraceful humor, and an absurd plot.	2001-08-10

In the first quarter of the book I find I'm reading accidents that were published long ago on the net by  &quot;News of The Weird,&quot;  and reading accident reports that were pulled right out of  &quot;Anguished English&quot;  by Richard Lederer or any cyberlist of auto insurance claims.  *Yawwwwwnnnnn*<br />Maybe it's me, maybe I'm simply disgusted with reading crime novels.  But I don't think so.  It's always the characters that make a crime novel good.  This Dar character is a cypher; the only good character that I could picture and appreciate was Lawrence.  This lack of a memorable main character is bad for a novel, any novel.<br />I know Simmons tried to craft the main and supporting characters along the same formula used by many scifi authors writing scifi suspense novels with gee-whiz gyro-headed whizz-bang characters.  But all these characters sadly gave me the impression of teeny-brained low-Qs.  Indeed, it might have been more interesting if Simmons wrote up on the overall uselessness of NASA's bumptious MORT tree, especially as it pertained to the Challenger fiasco as a premise to a better more interesting novel.	2001-07-18

I still maintain this opinion: when I run out of new stories by the really great writers like Lawrence Block, Joe Lansdale, Robert Parker and Dean Koontz, I start looking for mediocre writers to fill my reading time.  Authors like Stephen King, John Saul, Jonathan Kellerman and James Patterson spring immediately to mind.<br />I get no feeling from any of these characters!  They are not real to me, they hold no interest for me.  It's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind -- profound mediocrity.<br />The scenes are also dull and choppy.  I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere.<br />I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author.

The real talent, though, is that the reader really starts feeling for Nick.<br />It all makes sense in the last chapter when we see that Nicholas has only a few more months to live, but now remembers who he is, and can now have the time (thought barely) to write his memoirs as the book that you have just read.

The story rates a high 4 because it picks up the action from the previous episode, and it reaches a decision tree with this smug kid Sam, who is really too powerful and dangerous to leave alive, because he is also secretly evil...<br />This did not rate a Holy 5 because there was too much backfill in the novel.  I realize the series is trying to draw in more readers, but not on my bucks, thank you.  I thought the expository preface prior to the novel was sufficient for as much backfill as needed.  If one must have all this backfill to update readers of what happened in the previous book then the series is weak because the scenes and action should be self-explanatory, or else the characters could provide the backfill SPORADICALLY with cleverly crafted dialogue.  This  \\"History Book\\"  method of using great expositionary lumps is tedious to the reader; and so I had to skip over these literary land mines more often than I felt necessary -- enough to invoke irritation -- and merely because I found doing so kept up the pace this aciton series warrants.	2001-05-29

This book was very well paced, the continued shifting in perceptions of the main characters towards Who Is The Enemy is always a welcome treatment, lending as it does a more intricate layer to the overly simplified plotline.  The protagonists' morphing into semi-allies is also well done, I'll have to admit.  <br />Hey Kids: This series has become more important than Deathlands because it handles a wider range of mythologies, if you can dig it.  The series, though, is now more vulnerable than ever for devolving into stream of consciousness drivel from main characters.  Let us hope it does not fall into that bottomless chasm as it threatened to do when the characters were spiritually transported to parallel universes.<br />I also would like to see more technological doodads flitting about in forthcoming novels.  I certainly liked the volume that talked about the Aurora craft and its capabilities.  I also hope that perhaps this series can nestle more snuggly into more UFO paranoia and Area 51 mythos.  As I find that world fun to immerse myself in for a time, and apparently other readers do as well, judging from the  &quot;Area 51&quot;  novels from Tom Dougherty.  And as Dean Koontz has aptly demonstrated in his Wyvern Base series, there's a lot of paranoidal mythos-spinning yarn concerning abandoned high-tech military bases.  Perhaps a half-buried Crystal Palace R&amp;D facility would be appropos in one of the future installments maybe?	2001-05-21

I sympathize fully with the &quot;Ugh!!!!&quot;  review.  Over eighty percent of the book was wasted on incidental, humbuggery political machinations, and dripping with preadolescent kitty-'cat nonsense (I suppose to attract the preadolescent female readership here).  The only good political machination that I enjoyed was at the end, when the enemy declared a truce to delay their buildup of a final offensive.  But the swift ending felt cramped and I felt completely cheated.  That ending could have happened within the first half of the book.  Then it could have gone on to a mature conclusion worthy of the title and cover art enclosing this novel.  But for now the book cover yields to an empty sense of puffery, a smidgen of self-importance, one that is not backed up in the skill of the writing of an interesting tale; in essence, it is an annoying little example of the publication house's latest feat of ledgerdemain -- one rife with tedious adolescent jiggery-pokery.	2001-05-16

I originally rated this book a strong 2 but since Amazon's censors did not publish that review, I now have rethought my rating into a very weak 1.<br />That's not to say that this would change if we were using the old fashioned alpha grading system, in which case I'd have to give this a resounding D-.<br />We see in this novel King falling back on many tired and irritating stereotypes, the kind that Hollywood still likes to pander to the public as part of their empty dream factory -- namely, that all psychotic paramilitary types are Jesus freaks.  This so old that it is laughable, if it didn't hurt so much that the publishers want so much dough for this lousy book.<br />The story was trite and also did not go anywhere.  Many hundred of pages were initially devoted to rambling stream of consciousness dreck, none of it making any sense, and most of it emphasizing trivial concepts and attachments.  The characters were also too unbelievable, too goody-two-shoes.  I sensed that perhaps Stephen King was trying to imitate Dean Koontz's style, and doing a banged up job of it too!<br />This all combines to make this book the year's most immemorable performance by the late grand master of horror fiction.

This book contains the most pedestrian  &quot;secrets&quot;  of How To Writing ever.  Everything in it is of derivative quality.  So it appears.  It almost appears boring.<br />Maybe it is so off-putting because there are no secrets to getting published, other than to have a pure heart and clear head?  If you are writing for anything other than the enjoyment, you are not in the groove of it, as Mr. King points out.  And even though the late R. A. Heinlein claims to have written stories solely to make money, he really was coming at it from another angle -- the issue of being practical by writing a commercial product -- which is something Mr. King eventually addresses in another section of the book.<br />So, although King emphasises that writing should begin with an actual enjoyment of the craft, his approach is also one of practicality and the desire to make a commercially viable product -- to make money from your stories.  Plain communication and a sharing of warmth in your cover letter, plus a good yarn, will eventually win an editor over to publishing your work, as Mr. King illustrates in one example.  Maybe this is something you should try.  Try enjoying your writing and your efforts in communicating with a potential editor.  You might actually create an attractive product this way.  (Psst!  That's a Major Secret!)<br />So ... On Writing is like a good magic trick -- it looks deceptively simple.  But only so.<br />Watch the trick again -- read the book again.  Though you might still miss how it's done, you'll be getting closer to the real picture -- like one of those magic eye pictures.  You see, by observing the trick again and again, you will eventually catch a glimpse into how the magic of actually gettting published is built up around a special structure that consists of humble basic principles.  Principles that not even Mr. King was aware of earlier on in his writing career.  Yet that is what Mr. King is really trying to get you to catch in this part autobiography part lesson plan workbook: how to combine the humble little principles of writing and communication skills needed to give your work a sense of warmth and attractiveness, qualities that will get your work at least noticed favorably, if not published.  And Mr. King carries this off masterfully, without having to resort to boxing your ears over it all.  That's called being subtle.  That's called being a masterful magician.<br />Psst!

To sum up this book: I've seen all these moves before.  There is nothing fresh in this tale, and with the same predicatable ending accorded to all dumb as post heroes and heroines, it's a sure bet to leave the reader in a coma.  Question: Is Terry Brooks trying to be another Stephen King, one wonders?  If so, he should cease and desist at once.  Because this novel too is filled with annoying dimwitted heroes, villains, etc., much the same as SK's stuff has been lately.<br />You know, guys, It is hard to go through a novel following the antics of characters with extremely low IQs -- very tedious and dreary.  They keep doing really stupid blunders that you can see a mile away even before the author has the chance to write them down.  Oooh!  Aaaaahhh!  Surprise, surprise!<br />*yawnnnnnn*<br />Very predictable, very boring tale -- like  &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot;  which was a super dog of a story.  Woof-woof!  Dull-dull extremely, excruciatingly dull, boys and girls.	2000-09-27

Seriously?  The story was a bit confusing but OSC  allowed the good guys to win in the end ... whch is the only reason why I  gave it three stars...<br />The story is not a well structured fantasy -- the  center doesn't hold.  Too many inconsistencies.  Example: If Bear was stuck  in the pit for eleven hundred years and under Baba Yaga's spell, how did he  get out and manage to free himself from the witch's spell, AND to thwart  Hitler and intervene in all those other evil events?  And not only is Sam  Kinison dead, dead, Dead! but Johnny Carson's show is also definitely not  playing in the 1990's.  Try Jay Leno next time you have old folks watching  late night TV.<br />The most glaring error of all is this (unless Uncle OSC  was trying for some quantum effect on a macroscopic scale): the main  characters were bitching and fretting about when they were to cross over  the bridge.  You know, the bridge that crosses the twenty-seven or so foot  long chasm between the edge of the donut shaped pit to the stone island  that's in the MIDDLE of the CIRCULAR pit.  I mean, get an IQ, dude!   Haven't you ever heard of ignoring the bridge altogether and walking AROUND  this circular pit?  It's like trying to figure out how you are going to  carry back to the car exactly ten gallons of gas using ungraduated  containers, while totally ignoring the fact that there is a gas meter on  the pumps that figures it all out for you!  Stupid is as stupid does, OSC,  you Gump!<br />Combine that turkey layout of the bridge across the donut  shaped pit with Ivan's having an immortal god for a relative and maybe an  immortal god for a mom, and we have a completely confusing tale that makes  one wonder whether OSC wanted to be a Clive Barker here -- not that he is  anyone great to follow either.  The inclusion of supernatural relatives and  such was completely unnecessary.  I would also have liked to see a more  rounded treatment of the roles and origins of these mythological gods if  they were to be included, including how Bear can fight evil while all the  while performing evil as well.  But, alas and alack, too much time was  wasted on Nerd Ivan, what with his pre-adolescent worryings and frettings  about sex, as if he were some incredibly immature pimply adolescent.  A  really trite and dated handling of a key protagonist if there were ever  other examples to compare by.  Something better reserved for some B flick  on a scifi channel, where the writing is usually handled by some brain dead  flunky from one of those dilettante California schools for screenwriting  and hair design.	2000-09-05

And, finally,  the plethora of technobabble.<br />I saw no new moves to this tale at all.  In  Addition, The ending was extremely anticlimactic and silly.

US	51736144	RCUKXRDRG8ASO	0345433297	38926947	Nightshade	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Have a good night with Nightshade...	Yes, kiddies, that's right.  Have a good night with   &quot;Nightshade.&quot;<br />John Saul finaly wrote a decent suspense thriller  wherein a clear and satisfactory treatment of each character's motivations,  secrets, and history was given.  However, I don't believe John Saul knew  how to properly introduce the supernatural element he wanted for this novel  -- at least one that he felt satisfied with -- which is why the novel was  split into three confusing parts: mystery suspense thriller, a tale of  demonic poessession, a ghost story where the ghost can act out in the real  world, as in  &quot;Ghost Story&quot;  by Peter Straub.<br />I strongly  believe that  &quot;Nightshade&quot;  could have done very well, much  better in fact, without that hokey ghost.<br />Oh, the story reads fine as a  Norman Bates style mystery; but the allusions to a ghostly presence of a  femme fatale is clearly superfluous.  The treatment was especially  confusing because we did not initially know whether this was a ghost doing  all this evil, or an evil ghost working through the mind and body of a live  person.  Laying this foundation of mystery is all well and good, provided a  clear resolution of this matter is achieved at some time later on in the  story.  However, it was not done.  Thus this hazy supernatural veil remains  over the entire story, and therefore lending an amateurish cast to the  telling of the tale itself -- like a tale told at a firseide at night by an  eleven-year old at some summer camp<br />The action preceding the identity of  the antagonist was sufficient to hold the reader's interest, and so the  tale should have remained on that solid footing.  Adding a ghostly Cynthia  character to this story just did not fit in with the overal theme at all.   This leaves me to conclude this ghostly element having fallen flat  primarily because of this bipolar theme, which left the epilogue at the end  looking like a fifth wheel.  So, it appears JS was having trouble evolving  the Cynthia ghost, which should have clued him in to at least evict this  annoying and useless character from the novel earlier on by revealing this  persona to be from the anatagonist's psychosis.  However, this was not  done.<br />Instead we had to endure another unsteady plunge into the World of  the Supernatural.  This is indeed sad because it seems to me that JS was  heading in the right direction with this story in the last fifth of the  book, with his application of the standard psychological thriller theme.   But then it seems like JS waffled at the very end and decided to try  another stab at the hokey ghostly issue with the highly implausible ending  where the boy and his girlfriend both experience the possessive presence of  Cynthia the Ghost.  I believe Cynthia should have been left as the clear  memory that Joan had of her, then stick with the development of the  psychosis based upon these memories.  That treatment would have propelled  the book into the proverbial heretofor unseen heights of greatness.<br />Still  I give three points to  &quot;Nightshade&quot;  because at least JS  explained the characters and their motivations in a satisfactory and  compelling manner, and he also allowed the good guys to win this round.   Overall this book is a good read, and if you can filter out the weak  treatment of a ghostly presence within its pages, you might come to see it  as a reasonably good thriller with good character development.	2000-08-14

I had bought this book to get a fundamental understanding of how to build  a circuit for a particular application.  Forget it!  After reading this  book, I defy the beginner to build a practical circuit to do what he needs  from this textbook.  Essentially I found the treatment to be reminiscent of  all the badly written textbooks that I and others had to endure in college  engineering courses -- heavy emphasis on trivial detail, whil glossing over  the really vital knowledge that is actually needed in the real world.   There were no practical examples worked out that were of any interest in  the real world.  This is typical with textbooks written by college profs.   For someone with no fundamental knowledge of electronics, except perhaps  having a vague memory for what a resistor, capacitor and inductor does,  this book does little to ease one into a fundamental understanding of power  electronics.  Specific examples include the lack of any explanation as to  what an oscillting  &quot;switch&quot;  is.  Is this cryptic piece  electronics hardware a common off the shelf product?  If so, it would be  nice to have a brief explanation of just what exactly it is made of.  Is it  in the family of semiconductors?  Who knows!  This textbook certainly  doesn't even attempt to warm the reader up to this exotic piece of  hardware.  Instead, it is introduced as if it came from some whitebread  god, much like the dreary old physics textbooks did when going on and on  about thermodynmics and quantum theory.  The book would be vastly improved  if the author took the time and effort to work out more useful examples.   And this textbook is not unique in its overall lack of quality.  I have yet  to come across a textbook on power electronics that gives a working example  of how to calculate and build for a circuit that most folks are really  looking for: How to build a black box that transforms a low dc voltage into  a pulsed high dc voltage.<br />And therein lies the rub.	2000-07-07

It was properly eerie and densely  packed with all the right elements of pathos and horror.  Yet it started  petering out, and to an entirely unsatisfying conclusion, towards the end.   Better use could have been given to this hidden priest, yet the conclusion  by the author of who had dropped off each cursed object was not credible  nor clever.

The technical advances were, well ... magnetic, shall we say?<br />True the protagonist is decidedly one-sided to the point of  jingoism, yet the enemy is truly despicable.<br />In future episodes, of  course, I expect to see corruption, even within the so-called pristine,  elite good forces to occasional erupt.  For even a supposedly benign  military outfit will occasionally unwittingly harbor within its forces  bombers, sadists, pedophiles, and murderers, something that David Drake  adroitly pointed out in several of his SF-Military Action novels -- along  with the subsequent penalty for the acting out of such warped drives by the  perpetrators involved.<br />Though Leo did mention that, among the so-called  honest elite of physicists, he did, on a particular occasion, run into one  scumbag, that subtlety should instead have been brought out in the body of  his work, and not as a bitching aside when listing credits.  I just wished  he had added that level of sophistication to his story instead.	2000-03-09

But here, his novel gets a B.  I subtracted one point for the numerous missing words that made sentences incomplete (sloppy editorizing here).<br />The second  subtraction comes from my dissapointment over the cop-out story FPW used to  unify all these conspiracies.  I did not expect him to revive the Rakoshi  mythology.  I guess I was disappointed that he didn't try to create a whole  new Lovecraftian pastiche mythos/whatever to explain away this  phenomena.<br />Also, the novel was too short, and too much time was wasted, I  felt, in having characters getting whacked.  I'd like to see more troubles  for Repairman Jack, certainly lots more kidnappings of him, like the  characters in DEATHLANDS, would pick up the pace.  Also, I believe Jack  should get a partner to work with him.  He does not have the panache of a  Remo Williams to pull off his whack-jobs alone.  Even Remo has Chiun to  relieve the monotony of just following Remo all over the place as he is  busily knocks off people.  A female or male character who he encounters,  with similar background hence Monte Cristo drive, will keep Jack nimble,  certainly preventing him from becoming a dull pedantic boy at the very  least.

For a limited time only, you can waste money and time reading this uneven and ridiculously plotted novel.  The major point here being that the protagonists do not get to thwart the villain.  Such  nebulous retributions being relegated to chance and a ditzy annoying  character which no one cares about.<br />In addition, the Dean's character  deconstruction of Amazon.com reviewers in general as being  psychotic,  pettyfogging and grubbing insects is ignorant, boring and not worthy of  serious comment.<br />Do what I did and pick this one up at the library.  At  least save your money if you feel compelled to read it.<br />I hope Dean will  continue his Wyvern series, though, as it is starting to become  interesting.  He should definitely count FALSE MEMORY, though, as a total  loss, much like Stephen King's GERALD'S GAME and THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM  GORDON, all of them total boners from any rational perspective.  Perhaps  Dean's Wyvern abandoned military base adventure should be made into an  endless series, much like the DEATHLANDS or OUTLANDERS series from Gold  Eagle are.  Make the stories either with lots of bing, bang, boom action or  scary and tense hiding out scenes, including more puzzle solving.

It depicts a future that is super nihilistic (though not as nihilistic as DEATHLANDS: DARK EMBLEM).  *yawn*  So what else is  old?<br />Though an existence where you are trapped inside your own dead body  is certainly a strong metaphor for homelessness, and has its right to be  within any pages wherein a future dystopia is played out, I felt it was  done with particular sensitivity to the characters involved.  And I saw  that the protagonist's own death as something noble, and that his  willingness to live as a dead person with his dead wife as something that  should be seen for what it is -- the ultimate sacrifice of a loving husband  towards his wife.  A really powerful message there!<br />NOIR gives new  meaning to the phrase I enjoy using often when reading a slam-bang thriller  or action novel:<br />&quot;And they died happily ever after.&quot;	2000-02-21

Here we are in the late '90s, and we  have this old admiral listening to Lawrence Welk on the radio?  I don't  think so!<br />The opening paragraphs of the story seemed to have been written  by an eight year old: the sentences were clumsy and filled with overblown  redundancies.  Next, the plot was ridiculous, and the portrayal of just  about every spanish person in this novel bordered on loony toon comic book  pap, bristling with ignorant racist observations and cliche  stereotypes.<br />I really rate this book a big fat zero.

For those unfortunates who've never read a Lovecraft story before -- or their pastiches by wanna-be writers -- this is a good introduction to the mythological tripe that Lovecraft and his followers expound.  Straub pokes  fun at the inordinate seriousness many horror editors and writers seem to  embrace when reading and writing Lovecraftian tales.  Pete would have  gotten a five-star recommendation, if not for the fact that his main  character is a dweeb, a do-nothing know-nothing weakling.  Though I'll have  to admit that Mr. Straub does attempt to write a healthy romance and does  include capable women in the formula, along with interesting shadowy  histories of the supernatural Dunstan family.  However, it would have done  Pete better if he didn't use such a formulaic response in the unlikely and  inept hero that we're seeing too much of in recent novels and movies.   Yuck!  The original, tongue-in-cheek allusions to Lovecraft claptrap is  also a delight.  Which gave an originally rated three-star novel its  four-star rating.  However, if you want to read a much, much finer handling  of the Lovecraft mythos, along with terrific satire, read  &quot;Resume  With Monsters,&quot;  by William Browning Spencer.  And though Spencer's  character is likewise a dweeb in that story, the author uses it to maximum  effectiveness by playing up the dweeb factor with many hilarious  observations. Which makes it read like a hallucinatory P.K. Dick tale, only  loaded with belly laughs galore.  Mr. Straub has some hints of that too,  only it appears as if the author is barely aware of these golden nuggets of  humorous opportunities that he has written into the story, and thus is not  fully able to exploit them so as to turn the story into a hipper, funnier  read.	1999-08-17

In general I thought the novel was good, and at least there were no mispells.  The main characters were funny and the scenes were sometimes engaging.  However it was the way the scenes were  pieced together that threw me off.  And I also couldn't get into all the  cheesy characters that Levin paraded in front of me in a seemingly endless  panorama before getting to the punchline.  I felt way too much time was  wasted on these peripheral characters before getting to the actual criminal  and his double identity.  Also, too many good characters were killed off,  which left me feeling so frustrated as to want to shout at the whole story,   &quot;Why bother!&quot;  The intolerable killings of the main characters'  women alone, were as much of a turnoff here as it was in King's  &quot;Bag  of Bones.&quot;  And neither treatment makes for truly engaging subject  matter, even for a crime-horror setting -- being that it is too nihilistic  in content.  The final chapter (or was it chapters?) that was supposed to  focus on the main criminal failed to focus sharply enough, making it look  like something as seen through the Hubble telescope before it had undergone  extensive repairs and modifications.  The treatment would have been better  if there had been an earlier disclosure as to who the killer was, the  pevention of the cop's girl friend from being killed, followed by the  escape of the criminal from this screwed up job and the subsequent chase,  which could easily add more impressive weight to the ending and thus make  for a more satisfying read.<br />Still, it's not a half-bad effort for a first  time novel.	1999-07-23

I don't know who Casper the Ghostwriter is for installment #46; but (s)he's really good.  New Life (mutant as well as technological) has been breathed into the Deathlands saga for sure here!  With new and scary mutants and hints at the Archon conspiracy for that  necessary dovetailing into the Outlanders saga, I'd say Harlequin  Publishing has got themselves the BEST writer so far for this series!  Why,  after having finished playing the CD ROM game Half-Life, I felt as if this  writer was also inspired by Half-Life to come off with cleaner and nastier  mutants in this installment.  (Maybe this writer is Half-Life's author,  eh?)  The usual cast also exhibited more life and variety too, unlike the  studied cardboardedness that most previous issues contained.  Why, they  actually had you guessing at some points as to how they would react, etc.  The Final Conflict scene was also much more intricate and hostile, making  their collective lives seem much more on the line than usual.  A really  hyper adventure, and well worth the price of admission.<br />Great read,  folks!  Probably the best one of the bunch!  I also suggest you ignore the  low ratings from previous readers, as they do not seem to know what good  writing is all about.  Which is a shame -- for those previous reviewers, I  mean.	1999-07-09

This  novel is right-up-there with Koontz's seminal  &quot;Dark Rivers of the  Heart.&quot;  See how an otherwise free and enlightened government/league  of nations can quickly curdle into a stinking facist regime in our modern  world, and easily within one solar year.

Finally, the author(s) is veering, albeit slowly, away from the adolescent sexual tension in the novel.  We finally get to see Kane actually kiss Bridget Baptiste!  For a moment I thought the entire universe was gonna  slip into chaos the way it was drummed up so much!  Please continue to  leave out the excess juvenile hyperepressive sexual tension, and maybe  we'll see these two get through this SOON with some good greasy sex for a  change, okay?  Same goes with Domi and Grant!  Nevertheless I do not agree  with some of the other real reviewers that the characters were cartoonish,  since I always expected this series to portray the good and bad guys with  little or no complexity.  Mainly because it was the storyline and action in  this alternate future that I was keying into.  Understand this -- that I've  always expected this series to play out as a slightly more polished version  of a comic book story; and I haven't been disappointed yet.  Hey, if you  want some deep soul-searching characters, read Emily Bronte or Dickens, or  some other old claptrap.  Or rent a  &quot;chick&quot;  flick, were someone  is always dying and there are lots of silly tears being shed.   Boo-HOOOOO!<br />For me the characters are complex enough, and I'm glad their  relationship is smoothing out some.  I also hope the author eventually gets  out of this dreamy adventure deal with the three Chintamanti stones.  Or  else use them as toilet paper or something more useful at least, as it's  beginning to get truly boring.  I'd also like to see this series depart  from the rigid blind formula which I'm sure the publisher ratchets the  author(s) into, by the insistence that there shall always be the usual  three-strikes-and-yer-out, slam-bang-bang wham-o-bham-o action in each  book.  For this particular series I don't think that's necessary.  For  instance, I don't think the series would be hurt any if at least one  installment more heavily lent itself to more intricate plotting -- maybe  eventurn itself into more of a Tom Clancy type spy/suspense thriller (like  when they traveled back to a past in New York).  Something more cerebral in  future volumes would instantly raise this series to untold heights of  excellence.  If Outlanders contained the complexity of a William C. Dietz  or David Drake SF military novel, it would help.  I believe Lakesh and his  group need to find more sources of information, in the form of time-trawled  characters, to keep the series alive with new ideas.  The Chintamanti  alternate worlds is already getting quite tedious and boring.  So that's  going to have to be put to bed soon, if not sooner.  More historical data  is going to have to come from more believable and legitimate sources,  rather than this miasmic alternate world drivel, I think.	1999-06-14

If you want to read an allegorical story about publishing companies, editors, and literary agencies in general, you're welcome to follow the aliens' antics (or lack thereof) in this latest of  Bob Silverberg's epic no-interest tales.  But you'll have to read through  it carefully, though, as the book is riddled with grammatical errors and  typos, making one wonder if the ms. had ever been given a final proof read.   (Hah! proof reading in Hollywood?  Get real!)  The characters were  extremely dull, venal and stupid.  I could have cared less who croaked in  this novel -- well, maybe the firefighting pilot was okay, as he was the  ONLY one who portrayed a decent set of morals, though he was still a Dudley  Dull Do Right type of character.  But the rest of them should have had old  tires thrown over them and then been promptly doused in gasoline before  striking the match.  And as for the hacking talents part of how the  solution to the problem unfolds, I saw no evidence that Bob knew what he  was talking about in terms of being a cyberpunk in the know with his hacker  characters.  And some of the motives for characters acting the way they did  in the novel wouldn't even wash the toe of a mosquito!  For instance, I am  not convinced at all that the Andy hacker character should have been  released intact after he'd been caught by that red-headed female judge.   And Andy's lame excuse for being in lust with her should have further  impelled the judge to have him executed.  No, Andy should never have come  out of that exchange alive or intact -- especially since he was a total  threat to the alien's mainframe system, and was able to enter and leave any  city gate he interfaced with.  Sorry, Mr Silverberg, you'll just have to go  pull the other one, if you want to fool us into thinking this novel was  well drafted and executed.  Folks, all I can say is that I'm just glad I  borrowed this book from the library.  For it's a real boner.	1999-06-11

And, yeah, there are two major mistakes in the first sixty pages.  But my chief complaint was this: who cares about this psychotic character,  Trader?  What makes the Publisher think the average fan out there is eager  to follow the antics of a character who frequently crosses the border into  that of a murderous psycho?  Not me, Baby!  Hoo-Ha!  The treatment renders  the story into a disagreeable yarn, wherein nobody wants to follow the main  character, known as Trader, around much at all, if not totally avoid the  sucker completely.

Doyle on how he described the private dick, Sherlock Holmes.  Amos should  be given a more sharply delineated character, especialy in a short story  omnibus like this one.  I thought F.P.

I've read some of the ellegantly worded reviews already, and I feel I'll just be repeating what the sharp and savy people on this website have already commented on about U.N.  Mind you, This was my first introduction to Pat Cornwell's work ... and let's just say that it was not a complimentary one.  Her main Dr. character is too tiring to follow, like some butch dyke superwoman is what I got as an immediate overall impression.  And, yeah, the book was way too technical for the level of interest the story really was able to sustain, plus the autopsy and landfill descriptions were definitely far too gross to serve the author up any further accolades as a substantive writer.  I had to drop the book back off at the library after the fifth chapter, as I was getting bone weary and irritated with following the antics of this phrenetic, sexually frustrated, borderline psychotic main character.  I mean, I work a private job that gets public more than I care to have happen, and I too have to occasionally root around in filthy trash to look for missing radioactive sources.  But that doesn't mean I feel to need to ply others with a slop-by-slop description of my experiences.<br />Observation: From other reviews that I've read concerning her other novels, it appears that P.C. is an uneven writer, and is allowing a favorite main character to grow into a nasty bitch that perhaps better belongs in a women's prison for the elitist, sexist, and aggressively haughty.  I don't believe I wish to follow the baby buggy-type bouncy mood swings in such an author's work. (Makes me want to reach for the ibuprofen.)  END	1998-10-14

The women of importance survive in this story; a  quality that must NOT be undervalued in modern stories.  I've become  curious to see if the daughter-prostitute will be the subject of Leonard's  or Hap's wickedly weird logic, in an effort to get her to kick her rotten  lifestyle.  That might be a good exercise for Joe to attempt -- in the  midst, of course, of more righteous mayhem and ass-kicking.  Of course, Joe  could always take the low road, the easy sleazy, and get the hooker knocked  off in the next Hap-Leo saga.  If that happens...  Well, I don't think it  will, that's all.  What I mean is this: Joe's too supportive of his  audience, and properly cares for us readers to let that kind of  snappy-crappy happen to a character who bears some significant relationship  to an emerging character of importance in the Hap-Leo equation.  (Just  don't have Hap or Leonard be eating no jellified hog jowls, is all, and  we'll all keep our dinners in our stomaches, okay?)<br />Keep up the  outrageously fine work, Joe!	1998-10-09

The only reason why I didn't give it five  stars was because it had too much filler about some space pirate's  interactions with boring people and on a boring planet, leaving no room for  a satisfying ending.  Also some of the paragraphs were nearly  unintelligible, as the author tried, unsuccessfully I might add, to show  off how much he can write slick stream-of-consciousness prose.  (More like  stream of incoherent unconsciousness.)  And I think every reader out there  wanted to know the fate of the Machine guy.  Did he survive the blast; anf,  if so, did he turn into an emotionless combat commando?  If the author is  trying to interest us in a sequel, this cheap-ass ending is NOT the way to  do it.  The author would find it worth his while to read William C. Dietz's  McCade series, so he can learn how to make a really satisfying ending, yet  leave ample room to begin a wham-o sequel. Hell, even the Harlequin's men's  adventure series, like The Destroyer, Deathlands and Outlanders series,  have much better more solid endings than Armor's ending!<br />The author needs  to do more homework on his story -- but it shouldn't be that difficult a  task, given that most of the story is in excellent form.  Or perhaps the  author needs a new agent/editor, because what ever guidance he had on this,  in terms of cutting out stuff and adding other stuff, was not made by  someone that intelligent.	1998-09-10

After reading BC, I'm reminded of the reviews that some of Carl Hiaasen's  fans gave him over his latest book,  &quot;Lucky You.&quot;  Many  complained that he didn't deliver the great funny characters and situations  as he'd done in his earlier novels -- characters such as Skink, etc.   Perhaps some future nitwit might do the same with Joe's  &quot;Bad  Chili.&quot;  I certainly hope their front teeth rot and fall off if they  do this idiotic deed.  BC is right on target, both with suspense,  characterization, and great humor..  Maybe Joe decided not to deliver a  great funny line at the onset but he can afford to lay back.  The novel is  first rate when it comes to a gripping plot and outlandish scumbags.  Hap  and Leonard are funny but are showing realistic signs of internal growth,  so their relationship is not nearly as lively as in the past stories -- a  change I find refreshing.  Cartoon characters are the ones that never if  seldom change.  Which is why I enjoyed Joe's changes to his characters.  I  find the addition of Brett good for the character of Hap, and hope Joe  keeps her with the series.  I also immensely enjoy the private detective  pig farmer.  That guy should definitely make more appearances, and hey lets  have some really good pig and farm animal jokes to tell too!  There's lots  of good ones out there that Joe can throw into the mix, like how a big  mamma sow, lying in the mud with a dozen piglets clinging on her titties,  will make you think she's performing a David Copperfield illusion when she  makes that chicken that fell into her pen vanish with nothing left but a  few white feathers clinging to her snout.

I would love, in fact, to get a  refund for this collection of vague, incomplete, and frequently pointless  comic strip stories.  They did not entertain me at all.  Even The Masque of  The Red Death was too brief and also sparsely delineated in terms of story  and plot.  (I've read better plotting in some old Superman comic  books!)<br />I also didn't appreciate Lansdale's put-downs of various unamed  authors which he found unable to work with.  In fact, I don't really care  about reading a long-winded introduction to a collection of cheap comics.   So I certainly don't care to read about Joey's vague beefs over various  authors that he had to turn down for this project -- a project that  resulted in the worst collection of horror comics I have ever read.<br />This  book should never have been published.  Most of the stories were  incomplete, often rambling -- to the point that I seriously wondered if  most of these authors had ever recently been escapees of some psychiatric  facility?  These stories, for the most part, weren't only witless, but they  were incomprehensible at best estimate.  More like scribblings from a  bipolar schizophrenic subject thatn anything else.  Hardly entertaining, if  you get my drift.<br />Sorry guys!  Better luck next time.  Better yet, don't  make any more of these stupid comics.  Please!

AC is not really for readers of Joe Lansdale's  stories, as there is quite a bit of repetitious stuff in these comics that  were covered in his other paperbacks -- the most egregiously copied one  being DEAD IN THE WEST, which is already in another special edition trade  paperback!  The stories are great (hence the three star rating), but I felt  ripped off because of this excessive reprinting of DEAD IN THE WEST as well  as the other old, staid stories that have reappeared in other short story  anthologies.  The AC book would have been infinitely better if had served  up more of Joe's lesser known horror stories; and AC would have been spiced  up considerably if Joe had added a more witty number, like GODZILLA'S  TWELVE STEP PROGRAM, to the menu as well (even though adding that story  would also have been reptitious).<br />JL is certainly of a sufficiently  inventive mind to crank out more new stories.  And he would have better  served his readership out there if'n he'd a done this with AC -- like,  maybe, totally fresh short stories, dude!  I mean, if King can do this with  his CREEPSHOW anthologies, surely old Joe can crank 'em out too.<br />That's  my only beef about AC; other than that, the stories are first-rate, even  though they're as old and crusty as two-week old dog turds.	1998-08-22

I actually rate this book a minus five, since it is very fascist and chock full of immature prejudices.  It failed on several siginificant levels -- unless James meant the novel as a satire on what the ruling class envisions for the future.  However, treating my review as if JLH had written the novel with no attempt to make it a scathing and thoroughly unpleasant satirical treatise (ala a very dark version of Gulliver's Travels), I find the characters extremely irritating; not one of them is worthy to be called human.  They are immature, greedy and extremely nazi-like in their attitude towards God and their fellow man.  More like hyperactive weasels!  It also is a tremendous turnoff to hear the author extoling the virtues of a future that embraces euthanasia for the old, feeble, sick, imperfect, etc., by embracing Jack Kevorkian's viewpoint.  (Another clue which leads me to believe Halperin is actually delivering a satirical message here?)  In addition, not one characte! r seems to be motivated by genuine love.  If any were portrayed as being married and having kids, they were depicted like bright-eyed ferrets both in joyous viciousness and pride, yet no real sevidence of any depth of feelings as humans.  (Another hint as to its satirical intent?)  This novel doesn't just push the envelope of credibility too well, it bursts this overblown sack of puss with its own pretentiousness and overall rancid air of superiority.<br />The Truth Machine is also way too jingoistic, escpecially in its assumption that the USA is the most morally superior country in the world, with thoroughly moral and righteous government leaders.  Rather, it should present a more truthful viewpoint -- that many foreign powers hate our fascist guts because we've frequently invaded and slaughtered their brown people for economic gains, in many devasting and futile wars designed to destabilize their economies and solidify the slave labor that will make our products for 15¢/hour.<P! >Oh, and hey, theplot?  Well ... The plot is almost nonexi! stent, if not diaphanously thin to begin with.  And, again, the characters (as also observed by other reviewers on this great web page) are too perfect ... except for the fact that they all appear to be shallowly brilliant, if not outright dangerous psychotics solely concerned with their own wealth and manipulative powers.  The characters collectively view humanity as a resource commodity to cultivate and prune according to their private whims.  (Hmmm ... is this yet another hint as to the novel actually being a satirical work, who knows?)<br />Yet if the novel is really intended as a satire, it is literarily too dull, humorless, and irritating to actually be an enjoyable read.  I do not enjoy following the POV of some self-centered jerk; and I doubt most people enjoy such an experience either.  Hence the novel, if intended to satirize the inhumanity of a technocratic society, rings too false by not having any characters of any salutary morals in it to narrate this repulsive view!  of a technocratic future, at least to actually appreciate it from this venue (i.e., where's Gulliver?).  Hence,  &quot;The Truth Machine&quot;  comes out false as a quality piece of satirical fiction because we're forced to witness the unfolding of a story through the POV of several thoroughly despicable characters.	1998-07-30

He evidently likes scribbling lots of descriptive easy-peasy-japanesee crap, as it's flash painted in the book; and the characters are listless twits to boot.  Which is not too pallatable a menu to feed off on, if you wanna know my take on it.  For Instance: WG instilled in me a real interest in how the security guard (the only character with real character) was going to handle Laney's ex-boss; but instead of getting a nice hard conclusion, WG delivers a flaccid closure as evidenced from a vague questioning session between Laney and the other news station character.  Also, WG went limp again in another vignette that required closure, namely the conclusion as to what happened to the IDORU (as if anyone gives a damn what happens to that artificial character either); specifically, in connecting the DNA generator with the IDORU software.  I wish he did!  Then at least his drivel would make sense!  Though perhaps that's the tradition that's being created in cyberpunk lit. -- vague and flaccid endings/closures.  If that's what WG intends to promulgate within the SF Lit-world, then he should seek professional help.  He should also get off the pot so that others can have a chance with the literary stream!  However, should he ever, ever, ever get off the pot, he shouldn't epoxy the lid to the seat with these vague endings (like in VIRTUAL LIGHT as well) or something equally incomprehensible, so that the chiclet-minded SF editors won't get the impression that he's trying to cement vagueness in cyberpunk fiction, then demanding that this become a trendy literary criteria that must be followed for everyone else who wishes to get their own stories published.  Hell, call me Mary Pickford for all I care, I'm pretty damn sick of reading vague crap that tries to pass itself off as cyberpunk.  Makes one think that the author has flash-fried his brains on some truly esoteric and amazingly expensive (yet still wonderfully worthless) designer drugs....	1997-09-10

Though the book is riddled with typos and the POV is unnaturally skewed towards gun fanatics (thus rendering it rather unpallatable for mainstream reading), the facts and suppositions presented on the machinations of the current version of the US government makes Tom Clancy's works so far appear as if he's in a coma!  This book must be read by everyone who hopes to have a stake in the future of this Consitutional land.  It really is not that entertaining as a novel, but it packs a wallop in the legal machinations department that current government and police agencies are involved with.  If this book was written with more emphasis on people and [a lot] less on the technical gun jargonese, it would be a better novel.  Therefore, since it sits on the soapbox too much of the time, it only rates an 8 out of a 10 for me.  But that in no way means that the truths presented in the book have been muddied!  Good work, John!	1997-08-21

Usually one expects a  &quot;new&quot;  author's first novel to be the best one, followed by an uneven sequence of crappier novels.  Unfortunately, ZOD WALLOP is another blockbuster.  It's again filled with dry wit and subtle absurdities, as only Mr. Spencer can deliver it.  And the story is solid suspense as well -- highly unusual for a satirical work.  You gotta read this one	1997-05-05
