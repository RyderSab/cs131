What Lewis describes here is exactly that - an organization managed by fact and some very candid successes and failures with this approach.  Insightful reading for anyone in a similar environemnt (or anyone interested in creating such an environment!).<br />As a note, I agree whole-heartedly with the previous comments on this title - even if you don't like baseball, you'll find yourself more interested (and perhaps more respectful) in the sport.	2003-08-18

This book is radically different in that you get to hear the &quot;elephant's&quot; point of view!  If you have PoMo tendancies (forgive the labelling), this book will resonate deeply.  For those on the line - you'll be faced with some interesting questions that hopefully will generate new discussions.<br />For those who aren't into the whole &quot;new theology&quot; scene, this is still a fantastic book - well written and charming, deep but not pretentious.	2003-08-05

Sometimes this is because of a lack of understanding, sometimes due to an association with fringe movements.  Do not pre-judge this book.  Cymbala has put together an excellent admonishment to the church as a whole to become right with the Spirit.  Admonishing both the cemetary churches (those who are dead spiritually) and the insane asylums (those that practice unbiblical &quot;manifestations&quot;), Mr. Cymbala makes a strong and convicting argument for the renewal of the church through the recognition and acceptance of the Spirit of God.	2001-09-10

This completes the list of nice things I have to say about the book.  The artwork varies from good to dismal, the science is often poor or simply wrong (a list of my favorites:  Stephen Jay Gould is a controversial evolutionist!, most scientists believe evolution of higher life forms from nothing is inevitable(?), superstring theory is presented as a fact, only primitive civilizations have polytheistic religions(I'd love to know where he got this one from and how the Hindus of the world feel about it), and the section on the Brood shows such a fundamental lack of understanding of evolutionary theory that I was almost in tears).  I might even have overlooked these glaring problems if the writing about the characters had been good, but quite frankly, it wasn't.  The author mentions the possibility of sequels in the introduction; in response I say: Please don't.	2001-01-06

Books	5	41	64	N	Y	Excellent resource	As a member of the top 2% IQ(for those who insist on keeping track of such things - by the way the scores fluctuate, rendering them meaningless in practice), I can honestly say this book is work purchasing.  Some readers have taken issue with the use of so many resources, referencing their conclusions only.  In the academic world, we call these citations.  Referencing anything but is what we call plagarism.  Some have accused McDowell of circular reasoning, but this doesn't hold as he often provides more than one argument for a given point(the point of canonicity is actually a quote from a church father, not his own argument).  McDowell also provides tons of historical evidences to provide historical corrobaration, such as ancient coins, which in turn builds the trustworthiness of the text (standard historical practice).  Also, McDowell avoids discussing topics of no importance, such as the centurion guard (do you know what happened with Kennedy's SS Men?  No.  Why?  They're not important.), using the space to cover the topic of discussion.  Further, McDowell uses history and fact to make his arguments for him, rather than relying on emotionally tinged logic (such as Christ's death, which is the best documented death in history - even if you throw out all the Bibles, there still remains plenty of documentation - even without things that didn't exist like autopsy photos...).  In short, I whole-heartedly recommend this text for those willing and able to follow a logical argument to the only logical conclusion (not meaning to spoil the ending, but it points to Christ).	2000-12-13

An excellent rebuttle to the age old claim that object oriented methodologies have no place in scientific computing.  The text is throrough and well-written, without wasting massive amounts of space on code (ala many of the books released in the past two years).  While this text may be better suited for an academic environment, anyone involved in mathematical computation can benefit from this text.	2000-12-06

This text provides broad and deep coverage of the various topics that fall under discrete mathematics (set theory, boolean logic, graph theory, etc.) with clarity and simplicity.  This book is not designed to help you pass a test, but is instead designed to help you grasp and understand the topic, which it does very well.  Easily the best book I own on this topic (I often joke that the author covered my first semester course on discrete math in the first chapter!).	2000-12-04

That being said, if you  like HP Lovecraft, you'll like this book.  Die-hard Lovecraft fans might  want to take a look at the table of contents to make sure they don't  already own the stories (the last of which was originally printed in the  1950's), but this is an excellent purchase for others.  The text at the end  discussing Lovecraft's view on the Cthulhu mythos and its evolution is  excellent and helps to dispel many lies that have been spread about  Lovecraft.	2000-08-21

The  new edition replaces 2nd edition's emphasis on history with an emphasis on  the fantasy elements of the game.  Combat had the largest overhaul, making  the description of exciting combat sequences much easier for DM's.  Even  better, very few rules seem to rule out use of older (2nd Ed.) material -  although I think priest domains could have been explained a little bit  better.  Definitely the best D&amp;D product of the last five years.	2000-08-11

No UML, no suggested implementation, no rationale, no CRC - just a brief description of the pattern.  And I do mean brief; the GoF's  Mediator is reduced to six or seven lines.  If you're looking for a good  book on patterns, go elsewhere.  If you're looking for a good index to  pattern material you may already have (JOOP, GoF, Smalltalk Patterns, PLoP  books, PLoP conferences, and others) this may be a worthwhile investment as  the book includes excellent citation sections.	2000-07-24

It is not a book on how to write games in DirectX.  It is not a book about DirectX.  The book's stated  goal is to describe the process by which RTS/RTT games are created.  The  author accomplishes the goal with success.  While several topics are  covered in detail (the path finding section for example), most topics are  left alone for further research by the reader as there are well known, well  respected books covering these topics (tile sets, resources vs.  expenditures, threat levels vs. defensive capabilities, etc.).  If you want  a book describing how to create a RTS/RTT game, this is a good book.  If  you need a book on how to code, go elsewhere.	2000-07-20

This is an introductory text, and as such, accomodations must be made rather than using the entire text out  of some elitist notion(as a parallel, how many children know the real  nursery rhymes?).  Also, the physical quality of the book has been  assailed, which I see as baseless and without merit; its just as quality as  any other paperback book.  The text itself is straightforward, and fairly  easy to read.  Little time is wasted on cultural issues, which to be  honest, I find refreshing (I study ancient history and find it implausible  that a book purporting to teach latin could also do a half-way plausible  presentation of the attached cultures and periods).  Overall, a good text.	2000-07-20

This is a book about non-euclidean geometry.  Specifically, a specialized form of non-euclidian geometry affectionately referred to as taxi-cab geometry.  This is not a  table top book, but is a book for mathemeticians and those interested in  mathematics.  Others need not apply (regardless of how interesting the  topic is).  This is an excellent introduction to non-euclidean geometry  because it strips away common misconceptions about the nature of  non-euclidean geometries.  This text is excellent for grade school children  and those who would like to branch into more advanced non-euclidean  geometries like hyperbolic.	2000-07-18

The spells are alphabetical rather than by effect(as with the Encyclopedia Magica) and are given effective descriptions.  Two minor complaints:  quest &amp; war spells were thrown  into the final volume.  While I can seee the quest spells, I think the war  spells should have been included in the main.  The other problem is more  serious and prevents 5 stars.  The index catalogs spells by sphere - but  only spells the authors thought should be listed; instead of using a  special notation for non-standard spells, they put them in their own index!   For those who like to allow all spells, regardless of setting (through  creative renaming), this is something of a hindrance.  Otherwise an  incredible resource.	2000-06-05

One comes away from this book feeling very little.  Many of us don't use a &quot;Hell&quot; in our games, but something similar...in this sense the book was ok, providing characters and settings that are easily adapted to  your own environment.  The information on playing in Hell was fairly good,  as was the discussion of new kits.  For the price, the book is good (IMHO -  a wise decision on WotC's part to provide books of very specialized use at  a low price).	2000-05-30

While they avoid discussion of more complex issues, the clarity with which the topics are handled allows the  reader to scale the examples to real world problems easily.  The only  concern I had with this book was the coverage of Java Web Server to the  exclusion of all others.  Overall, a worthwhile purchase.	2000-05-17

The rest of the book leaves one with mixed feelings.  While the ideas are  interesting (we'll see how they work with the Eazel project), they aren't  typically applicable to the systems most of us work with (Windows,  X-Windows), leaving the reader somewhat depressed more than anything else.   This book is a definite read; if for no other reason than to inspire  thought as to the validity of any work you may currently be doing!	2000-05-17

That isn't to  say that one will agree with everything Johnson says(you won't), but for  the most part he was very insightful.  My only complaint is that there  aren't enough examples of how to avoid some of the problems(in some cases  the remedies are only applicable in simplistic situations) - the section on  TTY interfaces especially.  Also note, that while the book often touches on  web interfaces, the text is obviously geared towards traditional software  developers.  Overall, a worthy purchase.	2000-04-25

A couple of things prevent a full 5 though.  First, there's almost no information on the Mariskova(sp?) and there is a problem with the  Marshall variant that supposedly uses the stealh armor(the problem being,  in addition to not having stealth armor, it can't - not enough open crits  due to ferro-fibrous and jump jets).  The new tech is pretty extreme, but  well balanced.  Definitely a must buy.	2000-03-31

As a stand alone, the book is little better than tawdry romance novel with elements of homo-eroticism simply for the sake of  homo-eroticism with an apallingly negative image of faith(for those who  claim the novel represents Martin's life, I would beg to differ that a  convert to his particular faith writing a novel like this would constitute  heresy).  As a sequel to ACFL, the book fails miserably.  No connection  other than setting can be drawn without stretching the limits of  credibility.	1999-12-03

Note that this book does not take sides with any given religion(which is fitting considering angelology as a practice is at odds with most religions).  As  some other reviewers have mentioned the author does cite fictional sources,  but I would point out that the author always credits the origin of each  entry(the religion/mythology or work the entity is from).  A good table  book for those with a casual interest.	1999-12-03

Not meant for serious research into any one particular area of AI, the text is excellent for undergraduates(with questions that aren't  worded too badly - a rarity in AI texts).  More advanced AI topics are  given short shrift(as is typical), but are covered in sufficient depth to  give students an idea of how they work(three chapters worth if I'm not  mistaken, more than most texts).	1998-12-18

It simply documents it.  Further, the entire content of this book is available on Microsoft's website(a fact which I was unaware of when purchasing the book).  Even  worse, the book is out of date with the advent of the newest release of the  API(which has some good improvements).  Worst of all, if you're a  C/C++/Java developer using COM/ActiveX, this book is only marginally useful  as a reference, as the majority of code is in VB format(leaving out  important information like typing.....a trend I hope MS reverses).

There are two sides to this book.  First, as a book on the academic topic of artificial intelligence, the book is little better than an overview.  I cannot fathom why any serious computer scientist would bother with this  book from an academic standpoint.  The flip side, is the  sociological/anthropomorphic aspect; as an introduction to theories that  real researchers are investigating the book is silent.  As an introduction  to the presumed goals of AI research from a pop-culture standpoint the book  is excellent.  This book does not belong in an AI researcher's library, but  in a CS ethicist's.	1998-12-18

Note that a genetic algorithm is different from a genetic algorithm(Holland is responsible for the latter, Michalwicz for the former).  The text is meant as an introduction to successful strategies for  implementing EA's.

While several other tomes, such as the Oxford Dictionary of Christanity(another fine work) give a thorough detailed look at the bible, the OCB instead chooses a myriad of topics and names of importance and gives concise, detailed, bibliographed information on them.
