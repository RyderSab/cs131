This is a marvelous continuation of this life-affirming story about these intrepid souls and how they reach out and touch the lives of those around them.

US	52971092	R2XAMAR3EZGVWK	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Global Warming Political Battleground	Although a fictional account of unlikely heroics and romance for a beleagured hero, this book presents a strong case for the idea that Environmentalists do NOT use factual information, and that the movement is largely a leap of faith that plays on emotions. I don't think the author feels that there are no environmental issues as he does not side with those who trash the environment; but he demonstrates how deluded and unscientific most self-appointed environmental zealots are. A thought provoking book that continues the author's assault on the inflated egos of the current movers and shakers who are likely to do more harm than good.	2005-05-04

There is one very funny line and premise, but it could have been delivered in a 3 page short story. If he had made the misfortunes of the Professor more profound or more ironic it would make for a more entertaining series, but unlike Mme Remotswe of the Botswana books, he never really gets under the skin of the characters, puts them in interesting places, or touches on anything but the pretensions of academia.	2005-05-03

Other times I feel badly used by books that make me cry. I think this is more the later than the former, although I did enjoy the adventure. It does make you reflect on what things are important in life, and dream about what you would do if you could travel forward and back and observe yourself as you grapple with big events in your life. Nevertheless, I felt the book was manipulating me. I wanted it to deal with profound issues in addition to issues of the heart, but it never really dealt with genetic engineeering or the potential changes to the time-space continuuum if someone changes even something as small as a signature on a drawing. It mentions these topics, but does not offer any speculation or provide any challenge to the conventional moral imperative. I wish there were more to this book.	2005-05-03

I think it's brilliant stuff - it draws from existing studies and maps out a practical guide as to how people can craft protocols for reaching better decisions, i.e., when to trust snap judgements and when you have to look further to make sure you are not introducing bias. This is heavy sledding and requires a lot of thought, but Mr. Gladwell makes it easy to read and understand. Applying it is hard, but he give plenty of examples. I'm not sure what more he could do to bring this topic to life?	2005-05-03

McMurtry is a good writer in that he give you enough descriptions to make you feel a part of the story and enough character &quot;thoughts&quot; to give you insight into their presumed take on all the violence and uncertainty that surrounds them; while delivering some interesting history about a time when the West was a frontier, and change was afoot.	2004-07-27

He has a complex relationship with his son, and exploring this helps the reader see how this elderly soul is battling his own desire to bury emotions with his desire to reach closure on some unresolved issues.

In this book the young woman betrays her best friend to try to get in good with some rich kids, and then realizes her mistake. The pain and anguish of this kind of mistake are made tangible in this well crafted work.	2003-01-10

I'm not sure why this is such a popular book? A wrenching murder and then the painful aftermath are studied in great detail. This isn't an experience I would wish for anyone, so why do we need to read about it? I guess I was expecting something more based on the book's popularity. Probably it's my fault. High expectations often create a difficult hurdle for an author to overcome. I hope others found some solace or value in this. It was just a difficult downer for me.	2003-01-10

It would have been sufficient to tell the story of industrial espionage and sabotage, and keep the personal dramas to a minimium. If you enjoy the whole shebang, this ought to please you. I enjoyed both the plot and personal dramas, but I can understand people who got lost, lost interest, or gave up. The basic plot is right out of the headlines, and should be of interest and concern to us all.	2003-01-10

This volume is full of short stories that are clever, fun, and engaging. Almost all of his stories have surprise endings, and try as you might you can't figure out what the surprise is going to be.

It's more like a poem or an ode to an earlier time. I enjoyed the book, but recognize it's shortcomings	2003-01-01

He really is cynical about it all, without a lot of redemption for his characters. Since the situations are so preposterous you sort of don't care about the characters, but laugh at the disasters that befall them. He really makes some strong points in this compilation of stories, but you have to think about how to apply the allegories. If you could read one or two of the stories in a reading club it would be interesting discussing them.	2003-01-01

In this one, we get an in-depth look at his family with all their foibles and tragedies. There is redemption and greatness in the people that transcends the sadness, but this is not a fun book. It is a wrenching book, but a real 20th century classic about families, relationships, and destiny. Mr. Conroy writes with a woman's sensibilities, and  still carries the narrative along in a crisp manner. A truly incredible journey.	2002-12-30

The story is about some Ivy League students and their battles to live up to lives of great promise. The conclusion is worth the wait, as it reveals so much about what pressure can do to distort and destroy lives. Canin writes best about old people looking back on their lives as he did in Emperor of the Air and Carry Me Across The Water. Nevertheless, this is a substantial book that returns good value for the effort it requires to read.	2002-12-30

This is still my favorite as all the main characters receive some kind of redemption and achieve some sense of meaning in their lives through interactions with each other. it's such a life affirming book that it should be read by anyone going through a troubling patch. The grandma in the story attempts to help a dilinquent teen, and has a number of mis-adventures along the way. It's an entertaining ditty with some good lessons in it for everyone.	2002-12-30

Lyall Watson is a gifted scientist who suggests some provocative possibilities in simple prose. If you don't want to think about his speculations you will still be entertained by his biographical adventures about South African Bushmen and Elephants. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the author spends a lot of time telling the history of various Elephant herds and the men who slaughtered so many of them, and that's really a separate tale (or is it tail?)	2002-12-29

It's not a blockbuster adventure novel, but a simple ode to the working men and women who happen to live, love, work, and die on this small island. Maybe the author should change the title to NOT The Lobster Chronicles? Some folks picked on the author's grammar and writing style. I had no problem with it? I think the folks who tripped over her grammar just didn't like the story she was telling, and that became an outlet for their disdain. Maybe it could have used some better editing, but I didn't notice. I was simply carried along by the narrative.	2002-12-29

There was a perfect spot to end the book about 50 pages short of where it ended, and it would have been more impactful, and lend itself to a sequel (which is still possible.) However, I thought this was his best novel to date. The theme was repeated through both the plot and the narrative. It's a philisophical treatise that's both well crafted and entertaining. People who are slaves to plot lines might get frustrated, but the point of the book is made over and over again, with humor and panache. I'm reminded of Zorba the Greek: \\"To die is no trouble, but to live is to unbuckle your belt and look for trouble.\\" In this case Robbins isn't looking for trouble, he's just not taking everything so seriously, and he's trying to tell us all to lighten up.	2000-09-01

It is about respect for differences so different that you find them abhorent. It is about accepting things as they  are and trying to make them better rather than giving up or feeling sorry  for yourself. While the &quot;Enders&quot; books are ripe for teens, this  book is for adults in that it is more thoughtful and more about preventing  wrongful action as opposed to taking aggressive action.	2000-07-25

I  think perhaps his lack of familiarity with the country left him reporting  his findings more than commenting on them, and it's his commentary that is  so engaging. the book had more history and descriptions, and I wanted the  wise cracks!	2000-06-17

The student from Shropshire, England is probably the only critique you need. However, I've had a few friends read it and they were somewhat repulsed by some of the graphic descriptions of the Skellig character, so I guess this isn't for everyone. It does have layers that make it more than a children's book, and engaging characters that make it a fun read. A cynic would choke on it, but if you are willing to read it as an allegory, and a study of the human heart, you will be swept away.	1999-09-07

If you can connect poetically you can enjoy a book like this; if not, it is pretentious clap trap. I loved The Book Shop: A Novel by Fitzgerald, but this one was just too vague for my taste. For instance, Fritz's brother starts out jealous of Fritz's love idol, but then falls in love with her himself. There are no clues given as to how this transformation took place, no insights into what was so alluring about this giggling adolescent. Perhaps it's an upper class phenomenon where people who are bored with life create in their minds a world where some invented beauty obscures all else. I imagine the failure is within me, but if you have but one book to read by Fitzgerald, I'd recommend The Book Shop: A Novel.	1998-01-18

The characters are drawn in just enough detail to be recognizable; the contrast between goodness and mean spiritedness is clear, yet all the characters are flawed. A poignant story with a powerful message that stays with you long after you've read this book. The Kirkus Review said something about it being not as deep as The Blue Flower. I disagree completely. This book is about real life, not about some ethereal vision.	1998-01-18

Not a very satisfying ending makes me think this is probably based on a true story. A grand story by  a great story teller, with human drama and difficult choices.	1997-10-07

This book also delivers a healthy dose  of history about the culture of the American Indian  and what remains of a caring and vital people who  are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good  of others. There are some improbable happenings  here, but life is full of improbabilities. This  series of books has a heroine as its major figure  and she is a woman of courage and character.    Thomas Perry's other books (Butcher Boy, Mad Dogs)  are entertaining crime dramas, but don't have  the moral compass that is central to this series.	1997-08-22

This is simply a good read. Very plot driven, with commentary on a number of contemporary issues and personal relationships. It also is about power and greed, and the corrupting influence of money. It touches on the fanatical nature of people's response to abortion, and gives the reader an emotional ride over some very difficult issues. The main characters are complex people, while the supporting characters are a little unidimensional. However, through it all you are engaged in unravelling the crime and discovering whether the truth will prevail or whether money will buy the verdict	1997-08-18
