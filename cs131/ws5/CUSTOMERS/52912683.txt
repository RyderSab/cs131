In fact, at first reading, it's so clever and subtle that you might not even realise it's an alphabet book.  Plus it's just chockful of cats.  Big cats, little cats, grumpy cats, fat cats, thin cats, cute cats.  They're all in there.  Plus the odd rather brave bird sitting within reach of a cat!  If your child has a cat or even just likes cats, this will be a lovely book to share!	2001-07-05

I keep reviewing books by Debbie Bliss.  And I find myself saying the same things over and over.  This book is no exception.  The pictures are just lovely.  Debbie Bliss's knitting books can serve as coffee table books for knitters.  The layout is just delightful to look at.  The patterns are for classic items that can be worn for years.  However, having yet to knit anything from this particular book, I can't say anything about the difficulty of the patterns themselves.  I would expect that they are similar to other books by this author.  I generally make sure that I go over a Debbie Bliss pattern more than once before I start knitting.  Often, having an experienced knitter look at it can be useful as well.  However, whether you are a novice or an experienced knitter, you will enjoy looking at this book, even if you never knit from it.  We have watched Debbie Bliss's kids grow up in the pages of her books--they are two of her models for the clothing found in this book again.  Which brings me to one of the other joys of a Debbie Bliss book.  The knitted items are pictured being worn by real people, not fashion models.  I think it really helps you to picture the finished item on a normal person in a normal pose.  Not a model posed to make the sweater look as nice as possible, while the person wearing it is contorted into some very funny stance!	2000-10-27

I have yet to understand why humans so much enjoy reading about tragedies that have happened to others.  I am not saying this to criticise, I do it myself.  This book is about a horribly tragic event, yet I found myself  recommending it to other people as a book they would enjoy!  Enjoy--a book  about physical deprivation, mental hardship, suffering, and death.  Yet  it's true, I did enjoy it.  Enough to want to read other viewpoints on the  same event.<br />I am sure other reviewers have already mentioned this, but  this story, were it not for the tragedy it ended in, would often be  laughable.  I found myself reading pieces out loud to others in disbelief  at the idiocy or short-sightedness or arrogance involved.  Yet, there is  true heroism here too, and I wanted to share those bits with others just as  much.<br />Buy this and read it if you want to share in the experience of high  altitude climbing without ever having to actually do it.  Krakauer does a  good job on conveying what it must be like.  This is not an extreme sport  that people indulge in for an adrenalin rush.  This is extended hardhip and  suffering with high risks.  While I may never understand why people do  something like this, it is astounding to be able to share the experience  vicariously.	2000-06-20

I didn't realise until rereading them just recently how many of them had stayed with me.  The poems all deal with sounds, sights and emotions that  will be familiar to most young children.  And as an adult, the poetry of  Robert Louis Stevenson brings back that sense of wonder and amazement that  many of us lose as we grow older.  One of the poems that I will always  remember deals with how difficult it is to go to bed when you are told in  the summer when the days are long and the sun is still out.  who doesn't  remember this?<br />The illustrations in this particular edition, by Tasha  Tudor, capture perfectly the childhood world of the poetry--the imagination  in play is wonderfully portrayed.  Remember when the space under the table  became a cave, or a castle, or a spaceship?  These poems and the  accompanying illustrations deal with these imaginary adventures that all  children share in.  <br />Purchase this book and share it with other adults  and with the children in your life.  If it stays with you for the rest of  your life, then you have gained a treasure.	2000-06-16

The instructions are clear and well illustrated and easy to follow.  The rings are nice, and range from very simple to quite complex.  And of course, you can always  make bracelets and neclaces as well, just use more wire.<br />The whole idea  behind these books is just so well executed.  The seem a little expensive,  but they come with everything you need to get started, so really, they  aren't.  And it saves you that part where you buy the book and then run  around spending all sorts of money to make sure that you have everything  you need.  Or worse, never making anything from the book because you can't  be bothered to go out and get what you need.  This book, or any of the  other klutz books, make excellent gifts for the young or young-at-heart,  just for this reason.  <br />One word of warning with this one.  I dropped it,  and the bead container top popped off.  It could have been nasty, this book  comes with a lot of beads, and they're tiny!  Luckily, only a few were  spilled, and I transferred the beads to something a little more  secure.<br />Buy this one and enjoy it.  I also recommend hair wraps and hemp  bracelets from the same series.	2000-06-15

I have read the Canadian/UK edition, which is called &quot;A Little Love Song&quot;.  While the story seems to be very much the same, in &quot;A Little Love  Song&quot;, there are only two sisters, Diana and Rose.  While UK/Canadian  editions often have different titles, it is unusual for entire characters  to be added/removed.<br />Michelle Magorian's books all seem to be set during  or just after the second world war.  This is a period that may not appeal  to younger children, but for older teens and adults, these books are  wonderful stories.  While the plots often sound rather lame, the charcters  and language mean that the novels are enjoyable, humourous, touching, or  exciting.  &quot;A Little Love Song&quot;/&quot;Not a Swan&quot; is a  coming of age story, and deals with first love, sexual awakening, and  sibling rivalry, along with many other human emotions that will be familiar  to many of us.<br />If you enjoyed this one, look for &quot;Cuckoo in the  Nest&quot; also by Michelle Magorian.  It tells the story of a working  class boy who wants to become an actor, and his relationship with his  father, who doesn't approve.  While it doesn't appear on Amazon.com right  now, it is a new title, and is available in Canada and the UK (also through  amazon.co.uk).	2000-06-15

One very interesting point about this book, and I admire the author for pulling it off, is that Gen as a character can appeal to a wide variety of ages.  Somehow, the author has written Gen in such a way that you can read whatever age onto him that you want.  I know people who thought Gen was as  young as twelve or thirteen, and others who thought that he was closer to  twenty.  It's a very interesting tactic, I don't know if it was deliberate  on the part of the author, but it certainly increases the possible audience  for the book.  I know as a child and teen I preferred books with characters  my own age, or slightly older, and I don't think this is uncommon.  With  this book, Gen can be the age of the reader, whether the reader is 12 or  20.  Check it out.	2000-06-07

The author talks about knititng in a very casual, anecdotal manner--you hear stories of knitters she has known, of yarns she has purchased, of sweaters she has knit.  Many of her  stories are amusing while also practical.  Reading this book is like  learning from the mistakes of others.<br />However, alone, this book is not  enough to teach you how to knit.  While it is worthwhile reading for the  tips you pick up, if you need to look up a particular technique, you might  be better using a book that is more organised, or with chapter headings  that are less humourous and more informative. <br />When you first start to  knit, reading this book is like having a friend by your side telling you  where you can go wrong, and for that is very useful.  But it is best used  in conjunction with some other less chatty book, such as Debbie Bliss's  &quot;How to Knit&quot; or one of the many encyclopedias of knitting  techniques (many excellent OP titles can be found at second hand  bookstores).	2000-05-03

Ninteen year old New Yorker Jenny is looking back on the events that took place after she and her mother move to a run-down farm in Dorset, England to live with her stepfather and  stepbrothers.  Along with the story of Jenny coming to terms with her new  stepfamily and settling in to a new school where she feels like an  outsider, we also have the story of Tamsin.  <br />Tamsin is the daughter of  the original owner of the farm, from the fifteenth century.  For some  reason, Tamsin does not leave the farmhouse after her tragic early death,  but hangs around in ghost form, along with her ghost cat.  When Jenny sees  and speaks to Tamsin, this seems to stir up all of the characters of myth  and legend that abound in Dorset--Pookahs, Billy Blinds, and the Black Dog,  who appears as an omen of something terrible to come.<br />Yet as we find out  more about Tamsin's past, and Jenny is drawn deeper and deeper into the  place where past and present meet, we realize that not all of these  characters are merely mischevious--some are downright evil.<br />This book  builds to a whirlwind climax that will have you on the edge of your set.   It manages to be a thrilling ghost story while also a satisfying story of  family life and &quot;coming-of-age&quot;.<br />Very enjoyable.	2000-05-01

If you like the part of Harry Potter when he's living under the stairs of the Dursley household, before the happy bit where he gets accepted to Wizard school, then you'll enjoy these books.<br />The Baudelaire orphans are nice and smart.  But boy are they unlucky.  The book opens with the  Baudelaire parents dying in a fire and the orphans having to find a  relative to look after them.  Although there is a huge family fortune, they  can't get it until Violet, the oldest at 14, turns 18.  But this doesn't  stop the dastardly (and there isn't really any other word to describe him)  Count Olaf, a horrible and distant relative, and his nasty  henchmen/women/things from trying to get their hands (or hooks) on it.  And  as far as Olaf is concerened, the Baudelaires are expendable, a word which  here means &quot;not needed after Count Olaf gets his hands on the  money&quot;.<br />Just one word of warning--when the author says if you like  cheerful books or happy endings, stop reading now, he means it.  But if you  like miserable scary books with unhappy endings, keep reading!  And you'll  learn lots of horrible words with depressing or unfortunate meanings as  well.	2000-05-01

This book is probably not the best choice for absolute beginers.  For the very basics--casting on, knitting, and purling--you really need to find an experienced knitter to show you.  No illustrations will really be the same.  Try your local yarn shop, or your friends and relatives, you'll probably  be surprised by how many knitters you didn't know that you knew.<br />However, once you get past knitting and purling in straight rows to make  scarves (or other various sized squares of knitting), and you feel you are  ready to move on to colour or shape or texture or cable or four needles,  then this is the book for you.  This is the book equivalent of attending  workshops of the different techniques.  I still refer to the finishing  chapter when putting somethig together.<br />Yes, most of the patterns are  for kids.  But the reasoning behind this is sound--knitting a tiny sweater  for kids is much less discouraging for a beginning knitter than starting  out with something adult sized.  While some people will see something  through to the end once they have started, there are many who get bored or  frustrated, and give up.  I still have trouble with full sized items, and  often find myself starting a child sized sweater when I know I'm supposed  to be working on the one that was last year's Christmas present for the man  in my life (he's getting it for next Christmas now!).  So, if you don't  have kids, see if you can find someone who does to give the finished  product to.<br />In conclusion, nothing beats having a knitter show you how to  get started, but this book makes a good effort.	2000-05-01

As always, this book from Debbie Bliss is beautiful enough to be a coffee table book.  Gorgeous pictures (although they don't always show enough detail, a complaint that is common about Bliss books) of adorable children  and real families, including Debbie Bliss's own children--I think we have  watched her daughter grow up through her books.  Again, the same advice I  always offer when it comes to patterns by Debbie Bliss--read the whole  pattern over a few times, with a more experienced knitter's input if you're  a beginner, before even starting.  Then read it again as you go along.   <br />My only complaint about this book is that the cutest sweaters, of  course, only come in baby and toddler sizes, although many of the others  are sized for a wide age group.  I'm referring to the little  Scandinavian-looking jackets--one of which is pictured on the cover.	2000-05-01

Basically, this is the story of 22 year old Ariel, and how she tries to make it in the big city after graduating from college.  She ends up temping while writing a &quot;trials and tribulations&quot; (read &quot;sex&quot;)  column in a local paper.  A premise that could have been funny ends up  being slightly boring.  Ariel tries to appear as a bad girl, using phrases  like &quot;he ground my beef&quot;, but ends up having to make up the  dirtiest parts of her column.  And then, when she gets notoriety, the way  she wanted, she whines about it.  I just couldn't really care about the  character of Ariel at all.<br />For a more entertaining, and less graphic,  story about trying to make it in the big city and failed hopes, try reading  &quot;In the Drink&quot; by Christiansen.   As for this being &quot;the  thinking person's Bridget Jones&quot; (yes, it says that on the back  cover), I beg to disagree.  These are very different books.  Bridget is  purely trying to entertain.  Don't ask me what Ariel is trying to do, but  she certainly didn't manage to entertain.	2000-05-01

This is a wonderful book for amateur paleontologists and those who just like dinosaurs.  The authors visit all the famous locales, where the big finds were made (you know the names--the Badlands, Mongolia), and talk to those who are currently working in the field.  You learn some of the  interesting stories from behind the scenes.  Beautifully photographed as  well.  Accompanied by the skull of Edward Drinker Cope (&quot;the Man&quot;  when it comes to North american paleontologists, along with his nemesis,  O.C. Marsh), this is the ultimate dinosaur roadtrip.  Maybe it will come  back into print soon, with the ever present interest and appetite for  dinosaurs and dinosauria.<br />Librarians--while this was published as an  adult book, Amazon's suggestion of YA is right on--glossy photos, some  irreverant humour, nice layout with just enough white space, and a subject  that is always  in demand somewhere make it just right for a YA non fiction  collection.	2000-04-24

The photographs are  large and glossy, which is always a plus.  They manage to capture some of  the most amazing little creatures. Hummingbirds normally come and go so  quickly that you can't get a good look, with wings that are just a blur.  Well, that is what this book is for.  From pictures of baby hummingbirds,  to full grown hummingbirds in courtship rituals, these photos can be looked  at over and over again.  The text provides a wealth of information about  hummingbirds, and clear maps show range for the various species of  hummingbird.<br />All in all, a wonderful coffee table book, with entertaing  text, and pictures you will never tire of looking at.

There's something about the thought of a parallel world existing alongside of our own that has always attracted me.  This is a wonderful portrayal of that, written with a sense of humour, but not without a dark side to the  story.  <br />The two worlds meet when 14 year old Lindsay meets a boy called  Talon who is from the Downside.  Although Downsiders have strict rules  about not mixing with Topsiders or even going Topside at all, Talon decides  that he has to go on a Topside raid when his younger sister is sick and  only Topside medicine will save her.<br />Lindsay's father, who is an engineer  working on building a new aqueduct in the city (New York), accidentally  stumbles on the Downside.  Although nobody realises what he has found, the  Downsiders now feel that they are at war for their existence, and decide to  teach the Topside world a lesson for invading the Downside.<br />This is a  fast paced story, written with humour, that builds to a very satisfying  conclusion.  If you read and enjoyed this, and are ready for something a  little heavier (and longer), try &quot;Neverwhere&quot; by Neil Gaiman.   Believe it or not, there are Downsiders in London as well as in New York.	2000-03-28

However, this  book is not &quot;just a comic&quot;.<br />This graphic novel tells the story  of Helen Potter, sexually abused by her father for years, who runs away  from home, heading for the home of her favourite childhood author, Beatrix  Potter.  The book starts with Helen begging on the streets of London,  before she heads north to find Hill Top Farm, Beatrix's home.  <br />The story  of Helen's abuse at the hands of her father, and of the complete lack of  feeling and neglect from her mother, is told through flashbacks, and as  Helen talks to her pet rat.  This is interspersed with Helen's journey  north towards the Lake District, which mirrors her journey towards the  eventual confrontation with her parents and with her own self.<br />This book  is a touching story of hope told in a graphic format that will reach an  audience that a more traditonal text-based novel of this ilk might not  reach.  The illustrations are vivid, yet the characters are also  realistically portrayed (none of the gravity-defying female body parts that  show up in some graphic novels!).  According to the author, this book is  also being used in outreach and therapy programs for abused children and  teens.<br />This is a valuable book for any library to have.	2000-02-18

I was surprised to find the strong gut reactions that have prompted people to review it here.  It is, after all, a diary, not a textbook on teaching methods or a  technical report on the state of public education.  While I am sure it was  edited before publication, it is still a diary, and sounds like it might be  very much the way it was actually written at the time.  A diary is not  written while worrying about what other people will think of it.  It is a  space for your personal feelings and experiences.  After all, if Esme  Codell was trying to glorify herself as a teacher, why would she leave in  passages describing those days when she just doesn't care, or hates the  children she's teaching?  <br />This book is one person describing her  experiences in her first year of teaching.  Any new graduate, not just new  teachers, leaving school with a degree in something they love, sure that  they now have the knowledge and ability to change the world, will identify  with Esme Codell.  Whether or not you like her, or agree with her methods,  that isn't the point of her writing.  What she is sharing are her own  personal feelings and experiences during her first year of teaching.  How  many other people out there would be willing to share their diaries, even  edited, with others?  Like her or not, you have to give her credit for what  she did.  After all, if we only read books written by people we like and  whose ideas we agree with, it would be a pretty boring life!<br />Note for  librarians: the part where the author compares hookers to librarians is a  blast, and it's meant as a compliment too!	2000-02-16

If you heard about something like this on the news, or on &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot;--KIDNAPPED TEEN WHO SPENT TWO YEARS AS SEX SLAVE IS HOME-- you'd shed a tear, and think &quot;how wonderful that he was  returned home, they must be so happy now&quot;, and then you'd go back to  your dinner, or your book, or your crossword.<br />How many of us actually  ever think about what happens after the happy ending?  Can you imagine  going home, and then having to lead a &quot;normal&quot; life, where  EVERYONE knows what you went through?  It's one thing to be recognized  because you want to--actor, musician, politician.  It's another thing to be  recognized everywhere you go because everyone knows what happened to you.   This book makes the reader think about that.  This is the book about what  happens after the happy ending that we see in the tabloids.  And it isn't a  comfortable thing to have to think about.<br />This is an excellent novel,  well written, suspenseful and disturbing.  I only have two questions--why  did Ray return Jeff in the first place?  Just because Jeff pretended to  love him?  It doesn't ring true.  And why didn't someone immediately hook  Jeff up with a counsellor?  Even if he wasn't ready to talk, some effort  should have been made to put him in touch with someone qualified to deal  with traumatized kids.  <br />Definitely worth reading however.	2000-02-16

As with all of Debbie Bliss's books, the patterns in this book are for beautiful sweaters, cardigans, and booties.  And they really are quick--everything is garter or stocking or moss.  <br />The pictures are  lovely, but I must agree with an earlier reviewer below who says they are  not sufficient for a knitting book.  While they would make a wonderful  calendar (the kids are an adorable, multi-cultural group), they generally  don't show the whole item in question, or the view is too close up (some  double page spreads of the cutest babies, but I can't see the part of the  sweater that I'm trying to figure out!).  <br />While the patterns are indeed  quick (I knit up the booties in half an hour) and not terribly hard  knitting either, they are not easy to read.  I may have knit the booties in  half an hour, but I also spent a good few minutes just trying to figure out  the pattern.  Debbie Bliss doesn't use a single extra word in these  patterns.  While a beginner could easily knit these items, he or she should  have a more experienced knitter read the pattern first.  Read the pattern  over and over before you start, and then read it again as you go along.   Believe it or not, this will be the most complicated part--the knitting  itself is straightforward and quite quick.<br />All in all though, I am glad  to have purchased this book.  All knitters need some quick projects, for  when they just can't bear to look at that afghan again, or that man's  sweater they're supposed to be knitting for someone special.  And babies  wear such little sweaters!	2000-02-15

I laughed aloud at the &quot;Amazing Flip-O_Rama&quot; pages.  For those of you who don't know, &quot;Flip-O-Rama&quot; is &quot;the cheesy animation technique that lets you animate the action yourself&quot;.  Don't  forget to add your own sound effects.  In fact, you'll be laughing so hard  you might have trouble with the sound effects, but who cares!  This is THE  book if you have kids who aren't really into reading.  Everybody who sees  it at my work (I work in a library) has to pick it up and look at it--and  before they know it, they are laughing out loud.  Read the others too (read  the fourth one, about Evil Professor Poopypants, and you'll be changing  your name!).	2000-02-02

I notice that other reviewers have had to read this book for school.  I only wish I could have read things so realistic and relevant in school.  Books with characters  going through problems similar to mine, characters that I could identify  with and care about.  I look forward to reading more from this author.  If  you had to read this in school, you're lucky--try having to read &quot;The  Learning Tree&quot;!.	2000-02-02

But this book is well worth it.  Yes, it may be a children's book, but there are so many levels to it.  The bad guys are  deliciously bad in ways that kids understand, and in other ways that only  adults will pick up on.  The same can be said of many of the other  characters and events as well.  This is a truly wonderful book, with real  magic and wonder and some really creepy parts as well.  Oh, and if you're  wating impatiently for the next Harry Potter book, try this one in the  meantime!	1999-10-19

Yes, we all knew that cats are responsible for the development of civilization, and that we are all really just servants to the cats, true rulers of the earth.   <br />I loved this book.  The illustrations are  wonderful, especially the &quot;alphabet&quot;, as invented by Clio.  And  you don't even realize that you are being educated as you read!	1999-10-14

Take one look at this book, and you have to knit everything in it.  Each of these designs is beautiful, and the range includes something for every level of knitter.  Be careful though--she is VERY precise in her patterns,  not a single word more than is necessary.  Read everything twice then knit  it.  That said, if you think you will ever have to knit anything for a baby  or toddler, get this book.  The styles in it are classic, so you can knit  them for babies born this year, and then knit them again for when those  babies grow up and have kids of their own.	1999-07-20

They stayed with me, so when I so them in paperback recently, I picked them up.  Well, they read just as well  the second time, more than ten years later, as an adult.  What I really  enjoy about these is the way the author draws metaphors and comparisons  between two things that only exist in her books, yet the metaphor works,  you have a picture in your mind, you know what she means.  Highly  enjoyable, but the ending was not as I remembered--my memory must have  rewritten the ending in the 12 or so years since I first read the trilogy.   I would highly recommend these to any lovers of fantasy, especially teens,  but adults too.  If you enjoyed these books, you might also wish to try  &quot;Sabriel&quot; by Garth Nix.	1999-06-17

These books seem to be for kids, but they have huge amounts of adult appeal as well.  Look at the card in the back you can send away to get the catalogue.   It has two age categories:  &quot;I am a kid and was born in the  year______&quot; or &quot;According to my birth certificate I am an adult  but I deny it!&quot;.  Well, I must fall in the second category.  Imagine  two grown ups wrapping each other's hair in embroidery floss--sounds silly,  but we had a blast.  These Klutz books are excellent, easy to follow, and  fun.  If you want to learn how to do something, see if there is a Klutz  book about it.  It'll certainly be worth your money.	1999-06-16

Detailed, yet easy to understand.  Diagrams were excellent, clear and easy to follow.  Well illustrated with lots of pictures that actually served to  give you more ideas of things you could do that were variations on the  projects for which instructions were given.  I would recommend this to  anyone interested in learning how to do this.  Guess what my friends and  family will be getting for birthdays and christmas this year!	1999-06-16
US	52912683	RJGZJCC7K104Y	0888993471	343157521	Drive	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Diana Wieler does it again	Already available in Canada, Diana Wieler's latest book offers another gripping and immediate story.  This time, a roadtrip with two brothers, very different people, trying to work towards a common goal, and learning a  lot about themselves and each other into the bargain.  This author has a  magic gift when it comes to portraying people--Jens and his brother are so  real that they take you along with them for the drive.  I would recommend  this book for all ages.	1999-02-22

Rhan wants to become a television cameraman.  In &quot;Magic Nation&quot; Rhan runs into his old adversary, Lee Dahl, the Iceman, who draws Rhan into a world of corruption, racism, and murder.  Rhan also meets a girl, Jen, and tries to sort out his first &quot;grown-up&quot; relationship.  The magic that was present in the first two books is still here in &quot;Magic Nation&quot;, and Rhan is still struggling to understand what his special powers are and what they mean.    <br /> If you enjoyed the first RanVan books, you should definitely read this one.  Diana Wieler's novels should be read by all, teens and adults alike, because the characters are strong, realistic, and appealing, with all the strengths and weaknesses that we see in ourselves.  When you finish, you will be sad that the RanVan books are only a trilogy! <br /> This book definitely deserves a 10!	1998-01-09

This clever book nicely matches pictures to text. The pictures tell the story of a homely abandoned kitten as it finds a family, moves in, and conquers the humans.  In the text, she shares her insights into successfully running a human household with other cats. The book will appeal to anyone who has ever shared space with a cat.  However, it is not for the paranoid, because it will serve to reinforce your suspicions that cats really do know more than they let on!  The writing is amusing and the pictures are endearing.  For cat lovers, this is a book you can come back to again and again	1997-07-24
