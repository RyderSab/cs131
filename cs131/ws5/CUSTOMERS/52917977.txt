I usually prefer books that are authored by more than one writer--after all, the subject material is wide--but as I need to prepare for the exam early, I took the plunge and bought the book.    The book is detailed enough, but sometimes too detailed to the point where information is organized in bullet form, making it extremely unreadable. Many typo errors (for example, \\"effect\\" is printed as \\"affect\\") lowers readability even further.    All said, the book does covers a lot of ground, but not the new objectives such as the section on ISO. I'm taking a CISA class so I consider this as supplement in addition to the official book that I will use. Overall, I would still recommend this book for insights into the author's experience, though I would not use it as the sole guide for the examination's preparation.	2003-03-25

I picked up this book because of its portability (I travel so I need something light to carry around), not expecting anything substantial to be inside, only pointers to help me remember some of the material I have already covered. Instead, I found this book to be a gem, a book full of concise material written in style that is uncluttered, presented in a format that is structured. Plus, the book offers online questions for practice. Besides the occasional typo or two, the only fault I can criticize about the book is its Q&A section--it seemed a little too simple for a professional exam.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book as a good first book to use, to quickly gain as much grasp of the security concepts in as little time as possible, and then slowly graduate to the more substantial offerings from QUE or Wiley.	2003-01-12

I've looked at the ones currently out there, and this book unfortunately, does not meet many of the mapped objectives. For example, the over emphasis of Networking seems to be about an introduction course the the Cisco CCNA rather than the book trying to give an overview of the CIW objectives. Subsequently, because of the undue weightage, the other objectives suffer, and notably, the HTML section which is briefly skimmed through.<br />While this book might give some additional info for those who have an added interest in networking, nevertheless, I feel that there are other books out there that give much more networking info and cost the same.	2002-03-29

Since then, there have been numerous other titles from other publishers, but none seem to stand out head and shoulders from the rest. Now, with the arrival of Coriolis' ExammPrep Server+ book, the wait for the standard is finally over.<br />The book is divided neatly into 17 chapters, 3 Appendices and a Glossary. Please note that the material is not mapped exactly as you would expect with the exam objectives. Instead, the authors have decided to arrange them in a more logical fashion (and they take pains to state so), but with the same body of knowledge still contained within its pages. Looking at the variety of Server+ books out there, this indeed makes more sense.<br />Within each chapter, you will find the twin Server+ certified authors to have the ability to present the material simply and to the point. Interspersed with illustrations, pictures and tables at the appropriate sections, the material neither overwhelms you nor bore you. At the end of each section, you will find Q&amp;As similar to the exam and best of all, something unique to this particular book, a section entitled Real-World Projects that allows readers to hone in on what they have read.<br />Minor editorial slips aside, like on page 49 where (CSMA/CD) is called &quot;Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Carrier Detection&quot; instead of &quot;Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection&quot;, the book on the whole will bring anyone up to speed on the latest on servers and server-related information, including discussions on the latest trends out in today's market.<br />A comprehensive Glossary, section on Study Resources and a CD-ROM complete this neat package, but the CD-ROM is nothing more thana rehash of the same questions in the book. Of course, you can download more questions as and when they are available on the website, but don't worry about it you don't, mastering the comprehensive material is sufficient to pass the exam, and pass with flying colors.	2001-09-15

This is because the compiled readings are mainly at best, guesswork. What's more, the weightages of the Ten Domains of Computer Security can be markedly different, and no one can really be sure of the importance of certain sections as compared to others. For example, both authors who are themselves CISSP certified, place Telecommunications and Network Security as more heavily covered in the exam than say, Security Management Practices, clearly a time saver for those who like me, am also pursuing the BS7799 Auditor certification.<br />Within each chapter, the authors also clearly prioritize the topics. In the Chapter entitled Access Systems, the topic Decntralized/Distributed Access Control takes up half of the chapter, again, demonstrating that more attention has to be paid by the reader.<br />Though the information to cover is vast, I never felt that I needed a map to navigate the contents. Each chapter's objectives are clearly stated, and the section lucidly explained. Best of all, the visual and textual aspects are just right for the eye. Of course, for a exam that covers 10 domains, the number of acronyms faced is numerous, but the nifty Glossary takes care of any confusion that may arise. Besides the coverage of the ten domains in 10 chapters, the Appendices are extremely helpful. Topics such as HIPAA Compliance through HIPAA-CMM are covered, so is the British Standard 7799.<br />If you feel that coverage is not deep enough (which is not really a factor in the exam), the authors provide useful References for Further Study, also found as Appendix H.<br />In summation, the book is extremely well organized, and the additional information provided in each Appendix make this not only a required study tool, but also a &quot;must have&quot; reference.	2001-09-14

Between them, they share the CCIE, CCDP, CCNP, MCSE, certifications among others.<br />What turned out to be a promising guide for my preparation became a revision tool instead. The coverage on OSPF, BGP and IGRP was clearly explained, but alas, the material was insufficient. I had to heavily supplement with the more expensive Cisco books for the test.<br />I guess you get what you pay for.	2001-08-21

While the book on Routing was merely average, this one rocks. The price was cheaper in comparison to other books on certification material, but the bonus was in the number of pages, the lucid explanations and the in-depth material.<br />The three authors left no stone unturned in presenting the material--I guess that as one of the authors is a long time Cisco insturctor--the presentation truly sparkles.<br />Interspersed with appropriate diagrams, I really loved the way the material is so easily digestible. This is all you need to pass the exam. Save your money and concentrate your studying efforts using only this book.	2001-08-21

There's Wendall Odem's book, but it's slightly not as conversational in style.<br />The labs are great and the IOS command printouts clearly explained.

I was brought up on virtually ExamCram books for my certifications (Cisco, M$, CIW, COMPTIA, Linux, etc), and I usually have good things to say about the quality and the mapping of the material to the exam objectives.<br />This book, however, is the exception rather than the rule. The material covered in just abut 250 pages sans the Sample Test and the Glossary is nothing to shout about. Take away the first 2 chapters which are merely basic stuff found most probably in their other books on the OSI model/Internet and so on and what you have is very skimpy material that hardly covers 30% on what the exam touches on.<br />The 70-216 exam is probably the toughest exam of the Core, and the Sample questions are no where near the Case Studies. Take away the pages with the questions after each chapter and you will certainly feel that the material begins to look more like exam notes rather than exam meat.<br />Look elsewhere if you wish to attain the coveted MCSE badge of honor.	2001-08-21

Samba Server Admnistration will therefore be a blessing for companies wishing to dwell deeper into the intricacies of Samba.<br />The book is well organized, and you can find info very quickly by thumbing through the TOC or the Index.

I was looking at training materials to teach the CCNA class and this is so far one of the best around (The other is Todd Lammle's Study Guide). It prepares students not only for the CCNA, but lays a firm foundation on the core concepts.<br />It does take a long time to master the materials--at least 6 months of both studying and labs--but it is all worth it. There are other materials out there where you can use and get the CCNA in 3 weeks or less, but you'll find it tough to move along the CCDP, CCIP, CCNP path, not to mention the CCIE exam.<br />Like their Routers, this set is also worldclass!	2001-08-18

Not bad for an intro book, though the writer's style is something that you would either love it or hate it. Don't know what the fuss is all about, but the RAID section is quite decent, with explanations on the seldom used RAID 2, 3, etc.<br />Strange the author is not Server+ certified and that is a real bummer: How can he know what to expect from the exam and yet professing to teach you to get certified?<br />Not as bad as some make out to be, but once you add the cost and compare what alternatives are out there, the inadequacy can really begin to show....	2001-08-18

Fraught with typos and errors, I can hardly believe that this title was even brought to market....<br />As early as on page 15, &quot;MM&quot; is defined as &quot;two-digit year&quot; instead of a &quot;two-digit month&quot;. On page 17 lists &quot;ea_h&quot; instead of &quot;each&quot;, &quot;usad&quot; instead of &quot;used&quot;. Even crucial Linux commands were not spared. A hundred pages later, Question 4, &quot;dpkg&quot; is spelt as &quot;dpklg&quot;! Again, if you flip to page 322, Question 33 and elsewhere, there is no distinction between an &quot;I&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, and since you can't tell the distinction between the letters, you cannot at all answer the question. There are more errors but I can overlook them if not for the fact that the material was so meekly presented that one wonders how claims can be made by the publisher as &quot;The Smartest Way to Get Certified&quot;.<br />Typos aside, the section on Hardware and Architecture does not elaborate sufficiently on LPT1 and LPT2 for the IRQs. Nor did the section on Package Management touch on non-abbreviated commands or alternate commands (L can also mean --listfiles, etc, etc).<br />I've highlighted only a few of the many deficiencies in the book since the errors are too many to list. The fact that the main author Chris Hare is not even LPIC qualified left me a nagging feeling that there is no quality control in place.<br />To sum it all, the book covers about half the objectives adequately of the LPIC exam. The rest is really a hit and miss affair by the authors (actually more misses than hits), who clearly reveal a lack of understanding of the material needed on the LPIC exam. (I personally believe that Dulaney's name is merely to grace the book, since most screen shots clearly shows Hare's user name).<br />The only saving grace is that there are more than 200 questions and answers that can help in some preparation. Usethis book only in conjuction with another book, and only if you got money to spare.	2001-07-12

Your brain is the 'killer app' when it comes to harnessing information on the Internet. Powerful search engines only serve up the food, but digital literacy helps you discern the right 'cookie.'  But seriously, when was the last time you actually validated information you received from the Web? We tend to take information wholesale off the Net because the curious thing about words - whether it is published in a book or on the Internet - is that it takes on an aura of authenticity. In that sense, the Internet is like a power drill - very useful yet dangerous if used without precaution.  Digital Literacy by Paul Gilster strives to equip the Internet researcher with content-evaluation and navigational skills to exploit the Net's many virtual libraries and information kiosks.  Content Evaluation As a research tool, nothing beats the Internet with its accessibility to information sources worldwide and its collaborative feature that allows like-minded individuals to share information. But information is a two-edged sword and in the excitement of a multimedia environment, it is easy to check your reservations at the door. Gilster's chapter on content evaluation is instrumental in teaching Internet researchers and browsers how to discern the source of the information by explaining what a web address means. In short, what the .com or .edu at the end of a URL (Universal Resource Locator) mean. In addition, Digital Literacy, delivers some nuggets of advice on how to steer search engines in the right direction instead of getting tossed around by the surf of information.   Critical Thinking On the down side, Digital Literacy, with its good intentions to teach information management to the Internet researcher is about a hundred pages too long. Frankly I wasn't interested in Gilster's long narrative of his typical day on the Net. Call me impatient, but a self-improvement or informational book should do just that - inform. And as concisely as possible. In a time when prose is more or less restricted to novels whereas information on the Net is presented in a non-linear hyperlinked format, it seems contradictory to read through a 250-page book to learn how to retrieve information from the Net effectively. Anecdotes are essential, but complete documentation of one's work day is a waste of a reader's time, especially one who is anxious to improve his or her proficiency on the Web.   Digital Literacy is an easy read for those who would appreciate additional background information on the nature and the future of digital literacy on the Net. But for individuals intent on beefing up their net-savvy, you should go straight for the core four chapters of the book.	1997-11-03

Or maybe you're sick and tired of people raving about the Internet while you sit and nod knowingly, but without the slightest clue what they are ranting about. If you have decided it's time to surf before you get alienated, but only have coffee breaks and short lunches to learn how to surf the Web, The Internet for Busy People can give you a crash course in surfing lingo.  The best way to learn how to surf is to dive in and get immersed in interfacing with the new environment. The Internet for Busy People does exactly that by using rich colourful pages that give you great screen shots of what you will see while browsing the Internet. As most individuals are more receptive to graphics inclined than text, the book's familiar and myriad screen shots shortens the learning curve, much like a computer flight simulation assists a pilot in flight training.   Besides great screen shots, call-out diagrams that point out how to fill out a web page form help overcome the form-filling paranoia that many of us have. For instance, what should you put in the domain box and, for that matter, what the heck is TCP/IP or SMTP Besides helping you overcome such nightmares, The Internet for Busy People does a great job in easing the rookie surfer into Netspeak and the lingo of the Internet surfer.  As you get more proficient with simple e-mail protocol, Crumlish grooms you for bigger and better things on the Internet like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and researching using Gopher to access remote libraries. But my favourite aspect of The Internet for Busy People is the expert dialogue box that peppers the book with wise words from the pros. In so doing, Crumlish actually treats you like an intelligent, albeit busy person that doesn't need to be coddled with simplistic information. Even for a seasoned surfer, I picked up some new tricks and got some questions answered from the expert advice dialogue boxes.   I've always found that writing style and tone of voice in any computer publication is the make-or-break factor in my enjoyment of a book. It's easy to accumulate knowledge, but  to share it in a non-condescending manner that doesn't put the reader off. Crumlish makes reading The Internet for Busy People like hearing from a friend enthusiastic about teaching you the ways of the Web.    The Internet for busy People is surprisingly affordable considering that every page is chock-full of colour graphics and illustrations. Basically, it's like browsing the Internet before you actually go on-line - a dry run, so to speak.	1997-11-03

But you probably won't hesitate to trash it if its content lacked substance. Likewise, an attractive Web site is merely ornamental if it is aesthetically pleasing but its information is in shambles.  Mastery of information presentation is a key factor as the Internet gives people access to more information. Although the Internet has been making vast improvements visually, the big glaring gap is still content. Many sites are just electronic novels with either boring or ill-presented plots.   Multimedia demands  Sight, sound and action - all of which we are familiar with, but the combination of which forms the environment that the multimedia writer must structure his or her writing to. Multimedia writing walks a fine line between entertainment and information. Garrand sees it as a continuum with information and entertainment at extremes, and a multimedia writer's most important task is deciding where to sit. Failing which, the work would end up as either an over-simplistic piece or, on the other extreme, a terribly boring article.  Who should read this? I remember a comic play I watched entitled Sheer Madness in which the audience, by way of questions, determined the outcome of the 'who-dun-it' murder-mystery. You can bet that the playwright anticipated every question an audience member might ask and wrote a script for that outcome (a total of eight branch plots). Writing for Multimedia by Timothy Garrand explores the demands that multimedia writers are under to fuse information with entertainment.   Whether you are a web page designer, a writer/designer, or an educator keen to incorporate multimedia into your lessons, you have to cultivate a new approach to writing for a very demanding medium. The multimedia writer needs to be a scriptwriter, a radio broadcaster, and a print journalist all in one.   Using a very effective show-and-tell format that highlights examples of interactive medium at its best, Writing for Multimedia taps the brains of top scriptwriters, web page designers and advertising executives for insights into creating compelling text that inform and entertain the viewer. Complementing the text information is the CD-ROM included with the book that contains movie clips, script samples, and demos for software and multimedia programs. And, more than just a theoretical approach to multimedia writing, Writing for Multimedia delves into specific case studies of uncovering the 'secret sauce' or 'X-factor' of certain multimedia CD ROMs and web sites that have made them a success.   Although Garrand has a tendency to get over-technical, he balances his information well with good examples from the CD-ROM and a simple writing style. Writing for Multimedia is a great how-to guide for anyone interested in spicing up their web site or adding life to a presentation.	1997-11-03

Smart cards are poised to invade two billion wallets and purses by the year 2000. If you have a credit card, chances are it will have a spider-like chip holding all your essential data. Even your mobile phone uses a smart card. But there are more applications to come, and with it diverse business opportunities for the organisation or individual who is always looking ahead.  Smart Cards, edited by Catherine Allen and William Barr with Ron Shultz, breaks the mindset of looking at smart cards merely as an electronic purse. It expounds on the many possibilities that this wafer-thin chip-in-a-card can do to revolutionise the finance and retail sector. In short, it talks about smart-card technology. But don't just take it from me or any of the authors--arrive at your opinion from the cast of major players in the smart-card industry that the authors have assembled.   Besides streamlining commercial transactions, the smart card will also have a hand in decentralising the storage of personal information. Hospitals will be able to access a patient's medical history just by reading the individual's smart card, thereby saving precious time in an emergency. At the airport, the smart card will make queues at the check-in counter disappear as travellers can check in electronically with their cards.  Besides focusing on the application benefits of smart cards, this book also addresses the stumbling blocks of electronic commerce, namely privacy and security issues. A whole section of the book is catered not only to the issues of privacy but also the existing technologies to counter this problem.  Innovative business individuals interested in leap-frogging ahead will benefit most from this book as it forces you to re-think standard business models in electronic commerce. Smart Cards also provides fertile ground for new smart-card applications because it showcases many ongoing trials and pilot projects.  My only disappointment with the book is that its research is mainly based on corporations in the United States, a country whose advanced telecommunications infrastructure is actually a disincentive to the adoption of smart-card technology. Europe and some part of Asia, on the other hand, have been more than enthusiastic in their use of smart-card technology, and should be able to offer more real-world insights into the nature of the beast.  On the whole, Smart Cards provides a good reading of the pulse of the industry and gets you up to speed with the business opportunities of &quot;intelligent cards&quot; that may soon slim that inch-thick wallet of yours--maybe in more ways than one!	1997-11-03

Even with all the development, like the World Wide Web and such, it is still a &quot;your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine&quot; kind of situation. But there are still some guesses that are better and more educated than the regular coffeeshop talk, and James Martins may have it.   In Cybercorp, Martins delves into the full spectrum of the Internet from an emerging phenomenon to its future growth. At various times reading the book, I was either scared or excited about the implications that the Internet has and will have on the business environment. The business or commercial model that we've grown to love is in for some major overhaul as the information era moves finance to the digital arena. You may argue that much of the finance industry is already in the electronic domain, but we've only just pulled the tail of the grizzly.  Currently, corporations are using the Internet more as appendages; the cybercorp revolution will see more corporations fully digesting the benefits of the Internet, making electronic communication its central nervous system.  This system will totally alter and engender hybrid management techniques. Cybercorps will have streamlined production, distribution and management sectors that make decisions with immediate effect, leaving no chance for backlogs and production bottlenecks. For instance, a grocery store is almost running out of soft drinks. The system in place would electronically recognise the shortage and communicate with a wholesaler for renewal of stock. Failing to receive a timely reply from the wholesaler, the cybercorp computer system would contact the next available supplier till the order can be signed, sealed and delivered.   Martins starts off with concise explanations of Web servers and Internet security; but this is just a launch pad for explicit business scenarios and management philosophies. For that matter, it's an essential read for managers and business people trying to peek at what's ahead.   Although pack full of information, Cybercorp is rather cryptic in the sense that Martins doesn't baby you with leading introductions. Rather, it's sink-or-swim therapy; if you can keep your head above the water, you'll reap the benefits of Martins' aerial perspective on the future of the corporate structure.	1997-11-03

Jager &amp; Rafael Ortiz McGraw-Hill Book Co  Besides their bank accounts, what is the X-factor that distinguishes individuals like Bill Gates as juggernauts in the digital industry? Is it their IQ, business acumen, or luck? It's hard to say, but one thing for sure is that every one of them has a battle story to tell and scars to show.  In the Company of Giants cuts through the ills of wordiness and brings to you, unfiltered, the ideas, insights and strategies of the movers and shakers of the digital world.   Remember the movie Phenomenon starring John Travolta? Travolta's average Joe character went from small-town mechanic to genius in a bolt of lightning. Now don't we all appreciate a blast of genius now and then; we all fall prey to the overnight success stories churned out by the Hollywood movie-making machine, but there will be none of that in this book. Everyone interviewed in this book is riddled with battle scars from clamouring to the top.   In the Company of Giants is written in a question-and-answer format preceded by a short introduction that reads kind of like a resume of the interviewee. A parade of clear thinkers and visionaries like Steve Jobs (Apple), Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Charles Wang (Computer Associates) pack the pages with their visions, business philosophies, and predictions. Although the Q&amp;A format is highly effective in presenting the ideas of these top guns in an unfiltered manner, I have reservations about the information and responses being too well-prepared and sometimes reeking of public-relations hype. Nonetheless, the interviewers did an excellent job of asking probing and exploratory questions in true journalistic fashion.   Success, as these individuals have experienced it, stems from an ambiguous mix of genius, perseverance and luck; however, that doesn't preclude the fact that there are some lessons that transcend the boundaries and is applicable in any industry - you will personally realise certain traits (be it work ethics or philosophical perspective) that fuel the success of people like Bill Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard.   In the Company of Giants isn't a feel-good book that will give you the false impression that you can make it big too. Rather, it's a conglomeration of right moves that you are obligated to filter through yourself and decide which is applicable. So, don't expect life-altering advice about whether to start your own business because, as Michael Dell puts it, \\"If I have to tell you, then you don't know.\\" But as a reference to the fundamentals of good marketing and human resource management from those who have been there, this book is invaluable.	1997-11-03
