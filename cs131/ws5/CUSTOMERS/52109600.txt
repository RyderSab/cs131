In Robert Greer's latest novel, bail bondsman CJ Floyd journeys down \\"Memory Lane\\" to revisit the atrocities of the Viet Nam conflict.  CJ is retained by a recently engaged Amerasian, to locate her father, Langston Blue, who has sequestered himself in the remote hills of West Virginia after his discharge from the Army nearly 35 years before. Coincidentally, a botched assassination attempt on Blue's life forces him to Denver to attempt to locate his long-lost daughter at around the same time that the city mourns the recent murder of a popular congressman.<br /><br />Floyd quickly discovers that the dead congressman is Blue's former squad leader from his old Army unit.  The plot thickens when the police connect Blue to the murder.  Floyd's role turns defensive as he searches for clues to prove Blue's innocence and discovers evidence of political corruption, covert military death squads, shady journalism, and suspicions of ethnic cleansing.  The plot is further complicated by conflicts in Floyd's romantic relationship with long-time girlfriend, Mavis, his desire to retire, and a vengeful ex-convict who blames Floyd for her brother's death and is out to exact her revenge on Floyd and his loved ones.<br /><br />This was my first time reading a CJ Floyd mystery and I found the story to be engaging and suspenseful; albeit a bit lengthy and heavy on dialogue.  Nonetheless, I think fans of the series will be delighted with this offering.<br /><br />(...)	2005-10-09

No one will know me until fifty years after I'm dead,\\" Scott said.  ~ Excerpt from Joplin's Ghost<br /><br />Tananarive Due's latest release, Joplin's Ghost, exemplifies the restless and wandering spirit of musical genius Scott Joplin.  The title says it all; however, this is more than just your typical ghost story.  Due combines speculative and historical fiction with a splash of romance and urban drama to produce a great story - period.  Joplin's Ghost centers on a young, eclectic, emerging Rhythm & Blues female musician, Phoenix Smalls, managed by an overprotective father and a flashy, high-profile, mega-record producer boyfriend.  As a child, Phoenix suffered through an eerie accident involving a piano which led to months of agonizing rehabilitation.  Shortly thereafter, a foreboding sleepwalking episode finds a ten-year-old Phoenix playing highly complex ragtime scores - years beyond her training.  Nearly a decade later, as her star begins to shine, she somehow channels Joplin's ghost and composes what appears to be scores from his lost opera, A Guest of Honor, inspired by Booker T. Washington's visit to the White House.  Phoenix avidly researches Joplin's life and discovers many uncanny parallels to her own, including a belief that she may be the reincarnation of his wife, Freddy.<br /><br />The Ghost is relentless; the possessions rise in intensity to the point of near-death experiences.  It is during her dreams that Phoenix is transported to Joplin's world, late 19th century Missouri.  Here Phoenix learns that Joplin was hailed the \\"Ragtime King,\\" and at one time celebrated as one of the most sophisticated and tasteful ragtime composers of the era, having unprecedented success with \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" in 1899, and \\"The Entertainer\\" in 1902.  He passionately pursued his great aspirations. Scott Joplin's only surviving opera, \\"Treemonisha\\" unfolds the proud story of an educated daughter of former slaves who rises to greatness in the post-bellum 1800s.  Unfortunately, true greatness eluded Joplin; Treemonisha failed and bankrupted him shortly after its shaky start.  The world was not ready to receive such a progressive tale, leaving the soft-spoken musical genius trapped and victimized by the social ignorance and racial politics of the era.  At times, it seems like Joplin is foredoomed because the opera's failure was not Joplin's only exposure to bad luck, but also because it seemed to plague him all his life: his daughter died in infancy, his first wife abandoned him; his closest brother died prematurely, and his beloved second wife (Freddy) died after only 10 weeks of marriage.  Joplin is portrayed as frustrated, yet still driven; as he suffers a prolonged and agonizing death from tertiary syphilis at age 49, tragically dying heirless and penniless in obscurity in a New York mental ward a few days before the outbreak of World War I.<br /><br />Due is ingenious in that she fuses Treemonisha's message of courage, education, and self-motivation into Phoenix's modern day music to reach and teach today's youth about social responsibility and history. The duality of the novel is that it serves as a wonderfully imagined work on the trials and tribulations of Joplin; and through Phoenix's ordeals with Joplin and other leading characters, Due subtlety mirrors and demonstrates the ill effects of record label rivalry and the  misogynistic, sexual, and violent lyrics commonplace in today's Hip Hop music.  Phoenix and Joplin's bedeviled journey is weird and intense, evolving into a life-altering experience for both beings as Phoenix hurries to free herself and Joplin from their cursed bond.<br /><br />No one knows for sure if Joplin ever stated the prophetic opening quote, but if he did, he was off by only a couple of decades.  \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" and \\"The Entertainer,\\" featured in the 1974 film \\"The Sting\\", earned two Academy Awards for its musical score; and Treemonisha was adapted for a Broadway presentation in 1975, which earned Joplin a special posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1976.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubearned Joplin a special posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1976.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Phyllis <br />APOOO BookClub <br />Nubian Circle Book Club	2005-10-05

Nonetheless, I picked it up with an open mind and was really surprised that this book was much better than I thought - I learned a lot!  The author, a noted lecturer and therapist, discusses harmful socialized behavior, traits, habits, and environmental circumstances that I instantly recognized within my family, friends, and myself.  However, the most important and helpful aspects of the book are the jewels of knowledge and positive approaches to overcome those behaviors and thoughts that were sprinkled through the book.<br /><br /> Chapman unabashedly peels back the proverbial onion to expose superficial issues that cover the underlying sources of tension in relationships - particularly African American relationships.  The multifaceted aspects of high (and sometimes unrealistic) expectations, economics, education, chauvinistic attitudes, black male shortage, etc. combine to make the dating and mating situations even more tremulous and complex.  The author examines and points out historical and current circumstances in African American culture that yields adults with voids and needs for emotional closeness. She proposes how popular societal messages often reinforce negative images and thoughts about marriage and commitment and goes a step further to cite how families, churches, academic institutions have failed black women and men in their efforts to make relationships work better.<br /><br />This book is intelligently written and loaded with sound, solid advice - often times she alludes to what could probably be considered \\"common sense\\" but subtlety inserts academic and scholarly sources to support her views or observations. What I thought was interesting was it seems like a great deal of the negative or problematic behavior brought to relationships stem from childhood experiences and the nature of relationships between parents and children (i.e. childrearing practices).  She encourages positive-thinking by looking inward first and offers tips for couples to connect on different levels, techniques to offer emotional and verbal support, how to block out external destructive forces, and develop fortitude for the \\"tough\\" times.  Individuals and couples can benefit from this book -- it is a great resource for all genders whether single, dating, or married.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubsting was it seems like a great deal of the negative or problematic behavior brought to relationships stem from childhood experiences and the nature of relationships between parents and children (i.e. childrearing practices).

Better Than I Know Myself is the latest offering of Virginia DeBerry and Donna Grant.  It is a melodramatic coming of age story of three girls from varying socio-economic backgrounds emerging into adulthood and their lifelong friendship until one of them meets an untimely demise.<br /><br />This novel reads like a \\"Made-For-TV\\" movie complete with unspoken secrets, lost loves, teenaged pregnancies, drug addiction, illness, perfectly timed flashbacks, and a host of canned, supporting characters.  Opening with a present day gravesite scene, the reader is forced to wonder which of the three main characters has died.  You are then immediately thrust back nearly 25 years to the early 1980's and introduced to each teenaged character as she plans to attend Barnard College.<br /><br />Jewel is the well-endowed misunderstood child star who has an ultimate \\"diva\\" type for a mother and a manager.  She is slowly coming into her own person as she defiantly decides to attend college on the East Coast away from all the trappings of Hollywood.  Carmen is the poor, shy, angry girl from the ghetto who works full time and relies heavily on scholarships to stay afloat.  Her dream is to become a doctor as part of a pledge she made to her deceased father.  Regina is the resentful middle-class child who fails in her academic studies but excels in party planning.  Through a twist of fate, they become friends and eventually roommates.<br /><br />Most of the storylines were a bit predictable (in my opinion) - they all are looking for love, so there are multiple dating scenes as they look for Mr. Right; two of the three have varying degrees of financial worry; and all have a serious case of dysfunctionality going on within their families stemming from unresolved childhood issues.  The core theme of the story is friendship and despite the differences in background, successes, and failures, they proved to be good friends to each other when the chips were down.<br /><br />The one element that kept me reading was the mystery laid in the opening passages - I wanted to know which friend passes in the end. I guessed wrong - so that added a welcomed element of surprise to the story for me.  Unfortunately, I had to wait 350 pages to find the answer....Overall, it was a well written story, but I found it to be very \\"soap opera-ish.\\"  Those who love \\"sister-friend\\" types of books will LOVE this novel - it has all the elements to make it a tear-jerker for the sensitive reader.

Continuing with the characters introduced in Jackson Park, Charlotte Carter returns to 1968 Chicago where an older Cassandra Perry is caught up in the \\"hippie\\" lifestyle popular during that era.  She is a rebel having moved from the protective home of her aunt and uncle into a multi-cultural commune where vegetarian diets, free love, and an endless supply of drugs are the norm.  She is playing \\"grown up\\" and her latest decision is to drop out of college - an act that would break her family's heart.<br /><br />Things quickly change when the lead interracial couple of the commune is brutally murdered and the commune members become the prime suspects.  Common for her generation, trust in the police is eroded by years of corruption, racism, and apathy, so she starts her own investigation into the death of her friends.  With the help of her aunt and uncle, she discovers a complex plot involving drugs, Black Nationalists, and vengeful Viet Nam war protestors.<br /><br />Carter has a gift for transporting the reader to another time and place via references to the music of period, the clothes, and use the slang terms and dialogue of her characters.

Her White mother, a flight attendant, was tragically taken from her in the much publicized airline terrorist attack over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 and her older brother was killed in a car accident two years later.  Largely abandoned by her mother's family because they disapproved of their daughter's choice of a black man for a husband, Trudy and her father were left on their own to grieve and support each other. Considered a \\"plain Jane,\\" Trudy has since lived a sheltered, conservative life in South Bay, California clerking in the family business when in between jobs.  She is engaged to James Long, a hen-pecked, chauvinistic, \\"mama's boy\\" who she has dated exclusively for the past ten years.  When her father's store is robbed and Trudy is sexually assaulted during the burglary, she is determined to find and keep a job that will allow her to escape the ever-increasing crime filled neighborhood.<br /><br />She lands a secretarial position at Bon Voyage Travel Agency where she meets a group of eccentric travel representatives and a couple of busybody administrative assistants.  Ann Oliver, a headstrong, no nonsense office manager, is the most enigmatic of the group.  She routinely praises and demeans Trudy; so much so, that Trudy cannot determine if she is friend or foe, causing her to struggle with feelings of admiration and loathing toward Ann.  In an act of retribution, Trudy justifies small charges on Ann's corporate account as compensation for ill treatment. Initially, Trudy has no worries of getting caught despite her best friend's warnings.  Knowing her job entails paying the corporate accounts, coupled with a striking physical resemblance to Ann - there is no one to challenge her spending.  However, exposure to beautiful people who travel to exotic places with marvelous jobs and wonderful love lives sprouts a bout of depression and second thoughts concerning her passionless relationship with James, listless life, and modest appearance.  She taps into a resurrecting cure from childhood to energize herself - elaborate shopping sprees and makeovers - funded on Ann's credit!  So begins the lies to cover the expensive dinners, parties, trips, couture clothing, etc. She becomes addicted to the lifestyle and when she finally admits to being \\"the\\" Ann Oliver things quickly spiral out of control.<br /><br />Monroe's latest offering is entertaining enough, albeit a tad predictable.  As with her previous novels, the characters are wonderfully imagined \\"everyday\\" people with vibrant personalities.  She aptly taps into the modern problem of identity theft and hypothesizes how an innocent like Trudy could easily succumb to the temptation and how simple it is to accomplish in the Information/Digital Age. Monroe weaves a fairly believable tale via Trudy and leaves the reader with two adages to ponder:  \\"Be careful for what you wish, you may just get it\\" and \\"Nothing is free, everything costs\\".<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubncerning her passionless relationship with James, listless life, and modest appearance.

There is a legend that the infamous New Orleans native and Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau never died, that, in fact, her spirit lives on in selected female descendents, each a namesake, and Laveau's faithful are awaiting her return.  Jewell Parker Rhodes (Voodoo Dreams, Douglass's Women, Magic City) births a modern day Marie in the second book of the Marie Laveau/Voodoo trilogy, Voodoo Season:  a Marie Laveau Mystery.<br /><br />The novel centers on first year medical resident, Marie Levant, a cum laude graduate from the school of hard knocks.  As a child living in Chicago, she discovered her mother's lifeless body on the kitchen floor and was whisked away only to be abused in the foster care system.  She defies the odds by excelling academically and winning scholarships to medical school, which she views as a natural progression to her inherent life-long healing abilities.  She is an animal lover, empathetic to her patients, and acts rather impulsively on her rather sensuous nature. The novel opens with her relocating to New Orleans, after being drawn there by unknown forces.  She battles disturbing dreams that contain vivid images of ritual ceremonies, childbirth, and a woman being persecuted. The tale is largely told from Levant's perspective and uses flashbacks/memories to show her immediate past as a forlorn child and haunting dreams to reveal her spiritual past as Laveau, the Voodoo Queen. As you can guess, Levant is the chosen one, and it seems everyone knows it but her.<br /><br />Rhodes sprinkles elements of suspense and foreboding in lines such as, \\"Summer.  Sin season.  Fever season.  Anything could happen.  Even the undead,\\" and emphasizes Levant's confusion and struggles as she comes into her \\"season\\" or her reckoning with her destiny.  She initially rejects her increasing power of healing, insight and intuition and balks at the awareness of herself as a Marie Laveau reincarnate; a powerful Voodooienne.  However, along the way, she begrudgingly embraces her fate as she discovers painful family secrets and the truth behind her mother's death and its eerie similarity with the murders of the young, unclaimed girls who keep showing up in her wake.<br /><br />Although not a strong mystery (more so filled with anticipation), the book does a wonderful job clarifying and dispelling misconceptions about the Vodun religion and the origin of Voodoo as the merging of African beliefs and Christianity.  One character explains, \\"Religions from the African Diaspora all value the snake as knowledge, all-knowing, an infinity and fertility symbol.  White Christians bemoan that a snake tempted Eve in the Garden.  But in voodoo, the same myth is a cause for celebration.  Snakes represent knowledge.  `Knowing is what keeps you safe, strong.'  What good is Eden with ignorance?\\"  Going a step further, she parallels spiritual icons. In one example, Legba is akin to St. Peter and serves as a gatekeeper.<br /><br />Rhodes masterfully blends in the historical decadence of the New Orleans of old - the true purpose of the Quadroon Balls with hints of the La Placage lifestyle, lessons on racism/colorism (New Orleans style), complete with beguiling glimpses into another world complete with ghosts, zombies, spirit gods, and ritual sacrifices.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubces her fate as she discovers painful family secrets and the truth behind her mother's death and its eerie similarity with the murders of the young, unclaimed girls who keep showing up in her wake.     <br /> <br />Although not a strong mystery (more so filled with anticipation), the book does a wonderful job clarifying and dispelling misconceptions about the Vodun religion and the origin of Voodoo as the merging of African beliefs and Christianity.

Now, nearly 13 years later, she is back with another definite hit, The Interruption of Everything, which focuses on the trials and tribulations of a middle-aged woman, Marilyn Grimes. It is an engaging novel that truly transcends race and culture because art imitates life - Marilyn's experiences are very real for many women of all ethnicities.<br /><br />Years ago, Marilyn put her dreams, education and career on hold, dedicating herself to motherhood and marriage.  Now, a forty-something-year old homemaker whose children have recently left home, she can't quite enjoy her new child-free phase of life.  She works part-time in a crafts store largely to fight boredom, loneliness, and pursue her lifelong hobby.  Her husband, Leon, a chronic workaholic, is absent all day and most evenings. Her children still rely on her as the primary problem solver for anything that goes wrong in their lives, whether it be physical, financial or emotional.  She unwillingly has been pulled in as chauffer, chef, and caregiver to her nosey, manipulative, opinionated, live-in mother-in-law and her mangy poodle.  Yet another burden she faces is dealing with her foster sister (a single mother and drug addict) who recently started disappearing for days leaving her young, unruly children with their ailing mother, who is showing signs of Alzheimer's.  Things are further complicated when a routine doctor's visit to address menopausal symptoms reveal Marilyn is pregnant!<br /><br />She is at the apex of frustration and exhaustion. A lonely, tired, and numb Marilyn struggles to reclaim her life, dreams and passions.  She summons an inner strength and musters resilience to determine her next steps despite wanting to \\"roll over and die.\\"  She resolves to reprioritize her life and place her wants and needs first.  She secretly applies to school, looks into starting her own business, changes her hair, starts to work-out, among other things. But just before she can share her proclamation with Leon, he, surprisingly and unexpectedly, announces that he is bored with their passionless marriage and is going to an exclusive, secluded Costa Rican resort - alone for a month - to \\"find himself.\\"  It would not be a true Terry McMillan tale without the power of friendship.  Marilyn's best friends, Bunny (a chronic sufferer of \\"no class\\" in the fashion and home d&eacute;cor areas) and `know-it-all' Paulette provide comfort, comic relief, and bring a little excitement of their own.  Thus the drama continues and pages are rapidly turned to seek the outcome.<br /><br />The novel is funny, laced with witty dialogue, great subplots, a few surprises, and unforgettable characters.  It has a universal appeal to all audiences and reminds women to find and rekindle their passion(s) and regain their independence.  The Interruption of Everything will hit close to home and touch hearts as an emotional and endearing tale. The commonality of the experiences and familiarity with its center, Marilyn, will pull readers in instantly.  She could be anyone's mother, sister, and/or friend - and that is the beauty and uncanny simplicity of it.  McMillan's fans (old and new) will not be disappointed with this offering.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubly applies to school, looks into starting her own business, changes her hair, starts to work-out, among other things.

It is somewhat difficult to write a review for The Forbidden without revealing the intricate plots of the previous four novels - all of which are formidable in their own right - detailing the trials and growth of Damali Richards, Vampire Huntress, Purveyor of Righteousness, and Millennium Neteru. In The Forbidden, the battle of good and evil continues, picking up where the last novel, The Bitten, left off. In this episode, the team is splintered, deeply wounded, and exhausted (mentally, spiritually, and physically).  Their faith, confidence, and fortitude have been challenged during the last battle that literally took them to Hell and back.  Damali, herself, is wounded suffering from a terrible loss of her child and seeks direction from the Light.  In a desperate act, Damali, is summoned to the Council of Neterus.  It is here we gain history and insight into the fates of the Neterus that came before her - including the first, Eve.  It is also where Damali must answer to her despicable and damning walk on the dark side with her lover/husband, Carlos Rivera, as detailed in The Bitten.  She is counseled and disciplined severely. She is sent back ashamed, weaponless, separated from her team, but with a better understanding of the magnitude and recklessness of her lustful behavior.<br /><br />She begins a slow and confusing road to redemption and must now reunite and rebuild her team, avenge her past sins, and regain favor and trust of her enlightened mother-sisters.  She must assist the resurrected Carlos in his transformation to become her equal counterpart, the male Neteru. They must put their egos aside and discover their destiny together while battling their most formidable foes to date:  Carlos's sire (Satan's son) and Satan's wife (Lillith) who has stolen something from Damali that is more precious than life itself.<br /><br />This novel allows us to bid farewell to a few familiar characters and introduces fresh allies and enemies, discover new powers and abilities, and reinforces the purpose and vision for Damali and her team.  It offers a wonderfully imagined blend of ancient folklore, mythology, religion, and culture that works brilliantly.  Bank's creativity yields an epiphany for Damali and her readers because there were many \\"a-ha\\" moments.  The plot is intricate and suspenseful, the characters numerous and complex, and timing is superb - great writing all around.

Earlier in the year, divorcee Kira Whitmore's beautiful daughter, Trina, was a high school senior and National Merit Scholar with a bright future ahead of her - starting with plans to study at Brown University in the fall. Then suddenly and unexpectedly, Trina changes and Kira innocently ignores a host of symptoms and warning signs.  Trina's behavior eventually becomes more violent and erratic, spurring frantic 911 calls and numerous hospital visits that finally yield a diagnosis:  bipolar (manic depressive)disorder.  Their lives are literally turned upside down when Trina refuses to take the prescribed medication (mood stabilizers and psychotic drugs) and resorts to alcohol and marijuana use which only exacerbate and amplify her self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />Like the good mother she is, Kira seeks and prays for a remedy or a cure, only to be told repeatedly that there is none, only lifelong treatment via prescription drugs.  A weary attending physician does not offer much hope when he informs her with a look of pure pity that \\"mental illnesses can transform people.  You may not be able to get back the daughter you had.  You may, as the saying goes, have to learn to love a stranger,\\" and wishes her good luck as a solitary comfort.  She rebukes the advice and frantically learns all she can about the disease and its treatment via support groups and her own research with the hope that a breakthrough is on the horizon.<br /><br />As hard as Kira tries to move in a positive direction, Trina's condition worsens.  Her behavior modulates like an unsynchronized pendulum, from depression to mania with little to no warning.  Kira reluctantly resorts to law enforcement to protect Trina from herself (often the subject of the attacks)and others.  The rules are simple - if Trina is deemed a danger to society; she can be held against her will in a hospital's mental ward for the requisite \\"72 hour hold.\\" Each time, Kira struggles desperately for an extension, but Trina \\"acts normal enough\\" and the requests are denied repeatedly - 72 hours is not, and never will be, enough time for the medication to stabilize the now rebellious, paranoid, legalized 18 year old adult Trina who hates her mother for wanting to \\"lock her up,\\" thus the spiral into madness begins anew at each release.<br /><br />At one point in the story, Kira is told, \\"when you love someone who has a mental illness, there comes a point at which you must detach in order to preserve your own life.\\"  But how can a mother ever detach from her child?  Desperate times call for desperate measures and, Kira, having exhausted all legal avenues, resorts to an \\"intervention\\" which mirrors a covert kidnapping operation that has some disastrous and yet surprising results.<br /><br />Campbell's story, albeit fictional, is an intense and compassionate testament that patients' rights often clash with what is best for the mentally ill.  She paints a very realistic portrait of both the victims and the suffering loved ones charged with their care.  Trina's descent into madness is realistic and painful to watch.  The medical and legal system's bureaucracy is stifling. Kira's dilemma is heart-tugging. Campbell's skill as a writer is evident with an ingenious thread which portrays mental illness as a form of slavery and blends in imagery and metaphors from the African American slavery experience - references to shackles, plantation life and the Middle Passage.  In addition, her usage of the Underground Railroad as a means of escape to freedom while looking toward the North Star as a symbol for hope and guidance was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Campbell's work brings forth awareness because it holds a mirror to society's sometimes judgmental and condemning face. Throughout the novel, we see unkind strangers, impatient friends, and judgmental neighbors who spew unwanted, mean-spirited advice and cite unwarranted rationale for Trina's outcome, oftentimes blaming Kira for not spending enough time with her child when she was younger and other nonsensical causes.  She also educates by sharing that a lot of mental diseases are hereditary/genetic and can be triggered by alcohol, drugs, or traumatic events.  She challenges cultural boundaries by emphasizing how mental illness is a low priority in many ethnic communities, particularly African American, regardless of how prevalent and obvious it is within the communities.  This is a wonderful, enlightening body of work told with the utmost tenderness and sensitivity.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub,  The Nubian Circle Book Clubient friends, and judgmental neighbors who spew unwanted, mean-spirited advice and cite unwarranted rationale for Trina's outcome, oftentimes blaming Kira for not spending enough time with her child when she was younger and other nonsensical causes.

Geneva, a chain smoking divorcee, is struggling to raise a teenage son with raging hormones, battles an ever increasing waistline and trifling ex-husband who seems to visit for sex only. She is a receptionist, gratefully employed by Crystal, who made it out of the projects via an Ivy League education with inroads to corporate America.  Crystal founded and chairs the Ain't I A Woman foundation which allows her to live large in a laid-out uptown apartment complete with a non-committal, rarely seen, gorgeous, successful boyfriend.  Crystal is not as happy as she pretends to be.  She is frustrated with her love life and most recently disappointed with leech, Chevy, who has \\"borrowed\\" $5,000 for \\"emergency surgery\\" which turns out to be a breast augmentation operation. This half-truth is Chevy's latest scheme to promote her gold digging ways.  She is a seasoned vamp, who uses men for money, clothes, vacations, etc. When her chain-of-fools wises up, her bank account dries up and to avoid eviction she moves in with the remaining friend, Noah, a successful broker and openly gay man who is troubled by his feelings of attraction to the opposite sex and bouts of uncontrolled bisexual behavior. All four friends are battling to keep their demons at bay from one another, so no one really knows what is going on behind their respective \\"grooves\\" - but by summer's end, the truth is revealed in a Brooklyn emergency room.<br /><br />The author develops the characters nicely, moves the story well, and has some creative, funny episodes; for example, Noah's counseling sessions for his emerging heterosexual feelings and Geneva's experiences with Calorie Counters.  However it was simply not enough for me because by the end of the book I was left thinking, \\"is this it?\\"  There was enough mild drama to interconnect the characters' storylines and lukewarm threads of suspense involving drugs, fidelity, and commitment to make it a somewhat enjoyable and likeable read, but the plot was riddled with predictability and a hint of familiarity hence the middle of the road rating.

Suave and debonair, Rich Marvel is now a detective in the newly formed homicide division.  He is doing all the \\"right things\\" to escape his humble beginning and elevate his social status.  He's determined to solidify his position and career by \\"marrying up,\\" that is, becoming the fianc&eacute; of a gorgeous socialite who happens to be the daughter of a local judge.<br /><br />Kendra Hamilton is a dedicated, goodwill physician who operates the free clinic in the worst area of town. She escapes the streets via education when a local philanthropist funded her studies through medical school.  When she learns of her mother's death, she immediately suspects foul play and insists that it is investigated as a homicide.  Kendra calls upon her benefactor to use his influence to pull strings in City Hall, thereby angering Detective Marvel for going over his head to investigate a seemingly insignificant drug overdose case as a homicide.  Tensions rise and memories are relived when the investigation takes Rich back to the old neighborhood that he so desperately wants to escape and forget.  When Kendra's suspicions of murder seem valid, a list of suspects is formed.  There is no surprise when the neighborhood's biggest drug dealer, Raymond Smalls, is brought in for questioning.  However the plot thickens when Raymond is romantically linked to Kendra, romance also blossoms between Rich and Kendra leading to jealousy between Rich and Ray, and a link is established between the victim and cold case files involving the Chief of Police and pregnant, missing, teenaged runaways.<br /><br />The novel was well written with steady pacing.  The author handled dialogue well and developed sturdy, but flawed characters with interesting pasts.  However, the story seemed a bit elongated, especially when it was obvious (to me) who the culprit was within the first 50 or so pages of the 369 page book.  Discovering the culprit's motive was the only impetus for me to keep reading. So the passages following the detective's reasoning skills as he zeroes in on the killer were not that \\"illuminating\\" as they should have been.  There were aspects that were a bit predictable and overplayed as with the love/hate relationship Rich had with the victim's daughter-turned-suspect, Kendra.  Nonetheless, the solid writing along with the handling of the drama and suspense combine to make The Savior a decent offering.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Clubt was obvious (to me) who the culprit was within the first 50 or so pages of the 369 page book.

Crenshaw's Deadly Satellites is an action-packed novel centering on the sabotage of a U.S. weapons defense system consisting of super savvy satellites equipped with laser armament capable of mass destruction.  It opens during testing of the system; the Top Brass of the military branches are there including the program's major supporter and Congressional sponsor, Senator Quentin Radcliff. Professor Luke Curtis and his trusty sidekick, Yuri Kurosawa, are the Harvard brains behind design and development of the Project H.I.D.E. (Homefront Initiative Defense Effort).  Not everyone is enthusiastic about this final round of testing.  Fearing the success of H.I.D.E. would cause the Navy and Air Force to lose funds and resources, Major General Charles Garrett and Rear Admiral Joseph Mayfield hope that the system proves inefficient.<br /><br />Unfortunately, H.I.D.E. exceeds expectations during testing and it is immediately afterward when strange things start to happen.  Professor Luke is kidnapped, Yuri is attacked, and H.I.D.E. is sabotaged throwing them in a defensive posture.  The satellites turn rogue, arm themselves, and begin to destroy anything in the U.S. airspace - including civilian aircraft. The President and the Washington spin doctors rush to quell nationwide panic. It is up to base commander Brigadier General Leland Burke to find the saboteurs and locate Luke Curtis - as he is the only hope to disarm the system and reign in the deadly satellites.  Time is crucial because an international crisis is looming -  a jetliner carrying the Chinese Secretary and his envoy of over 100 Chinese cabinet members is rapidly approaching U.S. airspace; and due to a radio damage on their plane, it is no way to communicate with them.  World War III is imminent if the Chinese plane is attacked by the US satellites.<br /><br />Deadly Satellites was a quick and easy read that contained all the elements of a political/military thriller - conspiracy, kidnapping, blackmail, intrigue, and treachery.  The pacing was fast as it seemed like the race against the clock started almost immediately and did not let up until the end.  The only nit I had was with the characters.  I felt they were familiar, almost \\"cardboardish\\" and somewhat predictable in their actions and mannerisms - it seemed like I had met them before in similar type novels and movies.

Developed by the editors and contributors to NiaOnline.com, The Nia Guide for Black Women:  Balancing Work and Life is the second in a series of empowerment guides for black women.  It is filled with practical advice for balancing work and personal life through tips, suggestions and person stories form successful black women such as actress Phylicia Rashad, songstress Brandy, entrepreneur Lisa Price, and Executive VP Janice Cook Roberts.<br /><br />A lot of the advice featured is very practical and basic; in fact, most readers might recognize the premise behind the examples as those they have seen presented before in other forums (books, magazines, online, etc.).  However, I think the authors were successful in supplementing their messages with information that specifically targets black women.  For example, I found the most unique aspects about the guide was the personal statements from the Nia summit session transcripts on differing topics such as \\"Financing Your Dreams\\" and \\"Don't Quit Your Day Job....Yet.\\"  The other chapters were interesting as well - they focused on demystifying the \\"Superwoman/Strong Black Woman\\" cultural image, reducing stress at work and home, soliciting a support system from family and friends, and turning your true career passion into profit.  There was a wonderful consolidated resource guide in the back that offers assistance in the areas of personal organization, career coaching, time-saving resources, stress reduction services, counseling and family support, business start-up services, and job search resources.<br /><br />One may not need to heed all the suggestions at once, but having this book on your shelf for quick and easy access to a great reference guide would be a smart move.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />The Nubian Circle Book Club	2005-05-08

Can't Get Enough, Connie Briscoe's follow up to PG County, returns us to the prestigious Silver Lake community and continues where its predecessor ended.  It instantly reconnects with Maryland's Prince George County's most memorable cast of characters who, for the most part, are still rich and still restless - a perfect combination for trouble and drama.  Barbara, the wife of philandering millionaire Bradford Bentley, has sobered up and now takes her frustrations out in the gym instead of drowning her sorrows in Belvedere vodka.  The results are fantastic - she is feeling good and looking even better.  When her real-estate colleague, Noah, 15 years her junior openly flirts with her, he awakens feelings and thoughts that even the most faithful of attention-starved housewives cannot ignore.  She wrestles with her feelings for both her husband, Bradford, whose womanizing ways led him to ignore and embarrass her for years by openly conducting affairs with younger women, and Noah, a handsome, attentive and sensual being, who is playing for keeps.<br /><br />A newcomer to Silver Lake, a one \\"Baroness Veronique,\\" befriends Barbara and plays devil's advocate to the blossoming romance between Barbara and Noah.  However, it is revealed much later that this royal newcomer has ulterior motives with an interesting twist near the end of the story.  The Baroness is the envy of the neighborhood after building a replica of a French chateau directly across the street from the conniving Jolene, the latest former mistress of Bradford.  Jolene is a scantily clad pariah, shunned by most of Silver Lake for her involvement with Bradford.  However, public scorn only fuels her desire to win back Patrick, her well-respected and admired ex-husband.  She stoops low and uses their daughter Juliette in a ploy to seduce him.  Patrick, however, is smitten with good-natured Pearl, the sweetheart of the neighborhood and friend to everyone.  When Patrick rejects Jolene, she, in an act of desperation, retaliates against Pearl in such a mean spirited and hurtful manner that startles all of Silver Lake.<br /><br />There is no peace, even for the \\"nice guy\\" as lovable Patrick struggles to raise Lee, his troubled teenaged daughter from a previous relationship.  Lee's half-sister, Juliette, adds gasoline to the fire when she starts to exhibit traces of Jolene (evoking a \\"Mini Me\\" persona of her man-chasing mother) when she sets her eyes on her Lee's boyfriend.<br /><br />Reminiscent to a daytime soap opera, the setting is posh.  Everyone is beautiful, possesses an American Express Black card, drives luxury cars and wears designer attire. It seems like owning Armani suits, furs, Jimmy Choo shoes and Mikimoto pearls are an unwritten prerequisite for Silver Lake residents.

Set in 1958 during Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street opens with Deke Watley, a nomadic gambler who has accepted an invitation to a high stakes Poker tournament sponsored by one of New Orleans's notorious residents, a blinded, aging gangster, August Moreau.  Carnival is in full swing - filling the streets with a myriad of bejeweled masked strangers. However, when Deke meets his fellow opponents, he realizes they are as equally eccentric.  Alex is August's angry, mulatto son from an island prostitute rumored to have dabbled in voodoo; Honey is the retired madam of one of the city's largest and most lucrative whorehouses; milquetoast Pritchett is August's lawyer and the keeper of secrets of all the dirty deeds; Pritchett's wife is a jealous whore-turned-housewife who has not changed her ways and finds pleasure in the backseats of cars along dark streets; and Hannah, a blonde bombshell, is August's young mistress and Deke's former love from a distant past.<br /><br />Although fairly short in length (169 pages), the suspense builds from the opening pages and accelerates as the plot thickens to involve all the above mentioned players (and others unnamed but equally enigmatic) to weave a tale of revenge, double-crossing, murder, and an unexpected finale (at least it was a surprise to me).  The characters are wonderfully broken and tormented - each nursing their wounds as best they can.  Gaiter's writing is strong as reflected in the vivid images he describes - I saw the atmospheric haze, I felt the heat, I heard the music, I inhaled the cigarette smoke, and I visualized the sweat dripping from the characters.  He added more realism by carefully interlacing the complexities of race relations and social inequalities of the day amid the decadent backdrop of the Big Easy.  I enjoyed the story and highly recommend it to those who might enjoy reading about this era and the suspense/crime genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Club	2005-04-20

It took me nearly forty years to figure out that she was right,\\" so says Juanita Lewis, who continues her adventures of self-discovery and serious soul-searching in Sheila Williams's latest release, On the Right Side of a Dream.  It picks up where Dancing on the Edge of the Roof left off, with our \\"shero\\", the middle-aged Juanita who ran away from home to preserve her sanity, pursuing another dream - a view of the Pacific Ocean.  She is trucking across the Rockies with Peaches and pondering her next move and along the way she prospers spiritually and financially via the use of her culinary skills.  Just as she thinks she has a life plan, fate intervenes and she must return to Paper Moon, Montana to bury an old friend (Millie).  Surprisingly, she inherits an aging, haunted bed and breakfast inn and struggles to keep her promise to Millie while her world seems to crumble around her.  Stress comes in all forms, but Juanita's constant source is that of her children.  Her daughter is insisting she return to Columbus, Ohio to baby-sit for an indefinite length of time and her son has been arrested for dealing drugs.  What's a mother to do?  She follows her heart with interesting results.<br /><br />Although I think the start was a little slow, I found the novel filled with mother-wit and eccentric yet lovable characters (which are seemingly becoming Ms. Williams's trademarks).  This novel does not disappoint-I enjoyed following Juanita on her daily adventures.  The pacts she makes to herself and the lessons she learns along the way are jewels that should be treasured.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Club	2005-04-13

The Professor's Daughter is Emma Boudreaux, a young woman who is struggling with the loss of her older \\"spiritual twin\\" brother, Bernie (Bernard Boudreaux III), who dies after a brief coma following a freak accident.  Emma has long been a victim of physical and emotional abandonment from her father, the world renowned Yale professor, Bernard Boudreaux II, but her brother's death seems to exacerbate her \\"condition\\" and pushes her over the edge.<br /><br />Emma's \\"condition\\" is that of self-doubt originally stemming from her ethnicity (her father is African American, her mother Caucasian) and the struggles of trying to fit into a world that is largely black or white.  She leans heavily on her brother as her strength during the early childhood years when she is taunted by other children.  She becomes somewhat of a recluse, excelling academically while learning to \\"disappear\\" or become \\"invisible\\" in order to avoid the negative attention her physical appearance seems to attract.  But this is not merely a tale of the tragic mulatto - it goes deeper - and Raboteau's beckoning style sets the tone perfectly.<br /><br />There's an expression, \\"the fruit does not fall far from the tree,\\" and although Emma was somewhat of an enigma, I found the professor's character more intriguing and complex.  Within him lies inner struggles and conflict that were seemingly inherited by his son with residual turmoil passed to Emma.  The professor is a brilliant man with violent and poor roots originating in the Mississippi Delta.  He is very secretive and guarded about his family history. It is in his recollections that we learn he was orphaned at an early age by a traumatic event that led his mother to madness and his father to an untimely death.  His journey from the poor house to the white tower is fraught with discrimination, abuse, humiliation, and loneliness.  He blocks the memories of his painful childhood with disastrous results - his unresolved issues affect his life and children in a most profound manner.<br /><br />The novel is partly narrated by Emma recapping her life in a series of recollections.  She reminisces about past lovers, her childhood, her college years, her self-imposed sabbatical to Brazil - complete with all the drama, longing, misery, and heartbreak that come with searching for oneself and trying to uncover the \\"mystery\\" behind her grandfather's (Bernard I) passing.  Raboteau takes interesting tangents along the way - cleverly supplementing the novel with Ethiopian and Sioux folklore that makes the story even more enchanting in an unconventional kind of way.  I will admit that this novel is not for everyone; however, I enjoyed it from its opening passages.

Toby Thompkin's release The Real Lives of Strong Black Women: Transcending Myths, Reclaiming Joy opens with a foreword, from Victoria Rowell, calling black women of the world to lean upon their courage to accept love and joy into their lives.  Thompkins goes on to explain that preexisting myths of \\"the strong black woman\\" have possibly done more harm than good by creating generations of problem-solvers, self-sacrificing nurturers, and steel magnolias.  These are women who often forfeit true love, peace, and happiness while caring for, working for, and/or bearing the burdens of others.  The author encourages self-examination, self-love, and self-preservation by dissecting the psyche and offering candid views into the essence of self-described strong black women.<br /><br />After interviewing hundreds of women and a few men, Thompkins organizes his findings and observations across key areas such as: mother-daughter relationships, dating, straight and lesbian relationships, emotional abandonment, and even a male perspective commenting on what men want from and for strong black women.  He also defines the myth of the \\"strong black woman\\" and references legacies of the slave trade, racism, and classism that helped fuel the myth of the black `Wonder Woman.' He comments on how the fallacy is often and easily repeated in every generation.  Each chapter includes soul-baring life experiences, lessons learned, and words of wisdom from women of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.  The chapters close with heartfelt, positive affirmations which promote spiritual healing and behavior awareness. This is a worthwhile and educational body of work that can be read in its entirety or selectively as it addresses a specific life situation.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis	2005-03-30

As he faces his last days and prepares to write his obituary he reflects on his accomplishments and failures as a parent, minister, and politician.  However, the book is more than a \\"fictional memoir\\"- it is a history lesson.  Spanning decades beginning in the post-Civil War era through the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement, Lester writes about the plight and elicits the viewpoint of a humble black man with a strong spiritual center struggling to survive in the racist South.  It is his soft tread, strong fortification, and faith in God that keep him sane and alive.<br /><br />As a child, he is the son of sharecroppers and is subjected to destitute conditions as his family deals with infanticide and poverty.  He loses his mother to depression, his father to alcoholism, and his older brother to restlessness.  He is \\"called by God\\" at a young age and becomes a self-ordained country preacher and primary caretaker to his younger siblings. He, by default, became the voice of his flock and caregiver to all, often being the diplomat when dealing with family squabbles, local politicians, and life-threatening racial situations.  Lester creates a flawed character in that Rev. Smith is not a perfect father, husband, or brother and the scenes dealing with his faults are depicted with warm sincerity and sensitivity.<br /><br />In the aftermath of the Civil Rights movement, his type of survival skills were frowned upon by the younger, more outspoken generation.  He and others like him were labeled \\"Uncle Tom\\" and called cow-towers.  They were scorned by the youth, ignored by the masses, and symbolically placed on shelf to be intentionally forgotten.  They did not admire the kind of strength, control, and resolve it took for Rev Smith and others like him to humble themselves in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Despite the slow start, I really enjoyed the book and the history lessons experienced during Rev. Smith's life journey.  There were many moments that tapped the emotions - some passages were painful, frustrating, and sorrowful.  Lester captures the essence of the eras with splendor -  for a black man coming of age in the Jim Crow South, nothing was given and life was not easy and this novel cuts to the core of the sentiment.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clubsons experienced during Rev.

Amber and Clayton rush to Africa to investigate and when Amber eerily vanishes (just like James), Malcolm and Clayton are determined to rescue her.  Eventually all four end up at the same plantation where the rules of the day elevate Clayton as the owner of his three African American friends.  They are stuck in the past with no clue how to return to modern day - so they fall into their respective roles until they can escape.  Amber befriends other plantation slaves and learns critical survival skills (like keeping her mouth shut, feigning ignorance and stupidity, not fighting back).  The \\"modern\\" characters undergo a humbling experience as they witness beatings, back-breaking work, humiliation, suffering, and learn of sexual abuse of slave women.  In her friendships, Amber ultimately bonds with a woman who will serve a key purpose in the novel and her life.<br /><br />Complicating things are the interracial aspects of Amber (African American) and Clayton's (Caucasian) relationship, Malcolm's desire to become more than friends with Amber, and Clayton and Malcolm's jealousy and envy of one another.  Also lurking about is the evil, sadistic overseer, Big Jake, who is determined to have Amber for himself.  The author shares a lot of historical knowledge of the era - citing the knowledge of herbs and roots that slaves possessed to heal themselves from beatings and brandings and it uses for other medicinal purposes; and their ingenuity and industriousness when it came to stretching their food, clothing, and other resources.<br /><br />Dark Roots is a wonderfully imagined and well written speculative and historical fiction novel.  I was captured from the opening passages and kept turning pages until the end.  I think fans of Tananarive Due (The Between, The Good House), Octavia Butler (Kindred), and/or Stephen Barnes (Lion's Blood) will probably enjoy Dark Roots.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clublot of historical knowledge of the era - citing the knowledge of herbs and roots that slaves possessed to heal themselves from beatings and brandings and it uses for other medicinal purposes; and their ingenuity and industriousness when it came to stretching their food, clothing, and other resources. <br /> <br />Dark Roots is a wonderfully imagined and well written speculative and historical fiction novel.

However, the author provided enough background to establish the history and torment of the novel's hero, Maceo Redfield, with little redundancy.  The Last King opens with Maceo returning from a two-year self-exile to help childhood friends and foster brothers Cotton, the professional basketball player and Holly, a local Oakland gangster.  Both men are wanted for questioning in the murder of a high-priced call girl in a posh hotel room rented by Cotton.  With Cotton being a star NBA player, a media scandal is brewing.  Maceo's instinct is to protect his family at all costs and mend the broken relationships and open wounds suffered in the aftermath of The Dying Ground events.<br /><br />We follow Maceo into Oakland's seedy underworld: the docks, dirty hole-in-the-wall diners, and crack houses.  Tramble writes with familiarity of the city - vivid descriptions and imagery, local political challenges and social ills of the late 1980's and early 1990's resonate throughout the novel.  The major drawback of the book is Maceo being in reactive mode during most of the novel.  He is no super-sleuth and seems a bit too trusting of strangers (perhaps that's supposed to be part of his charm).  He does not appear to have a clear strategy on how to resolve the murder except to find Holly - which largely involves collecting clues by visiting old haunts and sleazy contacts.  He seems to accidentally discover who the real murderer is - which wasn't too difficult for the reader to figure out early on - I kept reading to figure how it was done.  Nonetheless what was lacking in the mystery/suspense aspect, Tramble makes up for in creating colorful characters, insightful societal commentaries/observations , and a couple of unforeseen revelations in the end.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2005-02-02

The Fruits of Atterley transports the reader back to the Civil War era and examines the complex interrelationships of the slaves and slave-owning families who reside at the fictional South Carolina rice plantation, Atterley.  The novel depicts the social attitudes of the day and cleverly incorporates historical facts, philosophies, and personalities through the adventures of the main characters.<br /><br />The novel begins with the birth of Augustus (Gus), future heir of Atterley, and Promise (a mulatto slave) and follows them through to adulthood.  Gus's father, Zachary Riley, has political ambitions through his dealings with the powerbrokers of yesteryear.  We are exposed to some of the more popular viewpoints and rational used by land owners and statesmen to justify South Carolina's succession from the Union and their stand for slavery.  Gus's mother (Rebecca) is a genteel Southern Belle who sympathizes with her slaves until the \\"unthinkable\\" happens.  Gus and Promise grow from childhood playmates to adult lovers only to have their passion doused by the harshness of reality.  A terrible scandal ensues, the Civil War erupts, and Atterley and its descendents, like the fruits of its orchards, are left bitter, bland, and mealy.<br /><br />If you're familiar with novels of this type, the passages on the horrors of slavery will seem familiar because the author thoroughly intermingles the injustices and ugliness of human servitude in the stories of surrounding characters â\\" endless back-breaking labor, the beatings, the rapes, the family separation, attempts toward freedom, wrath of the master's wives upon female slave competition, etc.  However, one unexpected and somewhat refreshing aspect of this novel is the liberties that Promise and Hannah (another slave) take in their speech and behavior.  Even though this is a work of fiction, it seemed as though they were a bit blatant and disrespectful (by yesterday's standards) at times in their actions toward their owners.  Promise's educational level and her openly teaching other slave children to read also seemed a bit far fetched but easy to overlook.  I would have liked to see other characters developed more but understood it to be a story of the South in a turbulent time and told through the lives of Gus (a white man) and Promise (a female slave).<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading its sequel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllisers.

Dark Thirst is a distinctive collection of six short stories that focuses on vampires and their victims of color in varying eras and circumstances.  However, the central theme uniting the stories is the ugly consequences of their existence - a hunger for blood that is never sated, the clandestine lifestyle necessary for survival, and the bouts of loneliness that eternal life brings as they lurk incessantly throughout the night.  The stories are authored by some of today's popular writers and a few newcomers - each with a different slant on the age old villain:<br /><br /> *  The Ultimate Diet (Monica Jackson) - an overweight woman envies a svelte, beautiful woman who appears to eat all she wants and never gains a pound.  After discovering the secret of success, she loses weight and much more,<br /><br /> * Vamp Noir (Angela C. Allen) - one of my favorite stories in the book is about a black, female vampire who is an enforcer for the mob but has her own hidden agenda,<br /><br /> * Human Heat:  The Confessions of an Addicted Vampire (The Urban Griot/Omar Tyree) - another one of my favorites in which an old-school, New Orleans Creole \\"Casanova\\" scorns a lover's advice and develops an addiction to a highly dangerous and callow blood source with disastrous results,<br /><br /> * Whispers During Still Moments (Linda Addison) - a half-human vampire hunter struggles to battle a First and save himself and his love,<br /><br /> * The Touch (Donna Hill) - a sensual tale in which a sophisticated vampire is running out of time in which to find her human soul mate,<br /><br /> * The Family Business (Kevin S. Brockenbrough) - and the best was saved for last (in my opinion), this is a page-turning story of monsters in the `hood - were werewolves and vampires collide and a battered mother's love prevails.<br /><br />There's something here for everyone spanning from hip-hop to old school and romance to touches of erotica with splashes of horror and gore thrown in - because it is after all a collection of vampire tales.  Overall, this book is surprisingly entertaining - vampire fans should find mild if not total enjoyment from what is presented.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubcause it is after all a collection of vampire tales.

Hottentot Venus is a wonderful work of historical fiction by Barbara Chase-Riboud surrounding the exploitation and short life of Saartjie \\"Sarah\\" Baartman.  Saartjie was a South African herdswoman who was brought to England in 1810 and exhibited in a freak show for seven years as the \\"Hottentot Venus.\\"  She was exhibited in a cage partially covered in \\"native attire\\" where thousands came to view her protruding buttocks and elongated labia (\\"apron\\") - a symbol of beauty and desire by her tribesmen.  A distortion on the image of Venus as the goddess of love and beauty, Saartijie was heralded as the missing link between man and apes - thus propelling her as an atrocity to be gawked upon, repulsed and pitied by Victorian England and France.<br /><br />Saartjie's experience in England lands her in a famous legal case in which abolitionists took her \\"partners\\" to court insisting that Saartjie was enslaved and working against her will.  She, being an illiterate person, testified that she had signed a written contract with her \\"partners\\" and was being fairly compensated; however considering she died in poverty, the contract (if it truly existed) is highly questionable.<br /><br />Immediately upon death at age 27 from complications caused by alcoholism, syphilis, and tuberculosis,  Saartjie's body was sold and dissected to prove the theory that she was indeed the missing link and not human.  Her remains (death caste, full skeleton, and prized \\"apron\\") were callously displayed and stored in a Paris museum for nearly 200 years and were only recently returned to her native South Africa for burial in 2002.<br /><br />Chase-Riboud's in depth research and careful reconstruction of Saartjie's world is superb!  The novel is lengthy, detailed and descriptive.  It has a Victorian flair to it - especially in the passages where in depth dialogue is used to convey the Englishmen's misguided, racists thoughts of the time.  The author's imagination fills in the gaps and gives Saartjie a resonant voice that transcends time.  A true work of historical fiction as it references the French Revolution, American Civil War, and historical figures like Jane Austen, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Charles Darwin.  The reader empathizes with Saartjie, all the while pulling for justice to be served for her.  This is a touching novel - one that will stay with the reader well after the last page is turned.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubtjie a resonant voice that transcends time.

I Got Somebody in Staunton is a collection of ten short stories by award winning author, William Henry Lewis, that tenderly embraces human condition.  The stories depict honest, confused, and quite ordinary characters dealing with a myriad of situations, painful memories, and awkward circumstances in Black America.  They are simply doing their best to find their way in the world they didn't create.  I loved that the underlying themes carried in each story seemed to emulate a timeless and universal vibe.<br /><br />A few of my favorite stories are:<br /><br />Shades, where a young teenaged boy meets his father for the first time and questions his feelings for the man who abandoned him on the night of his conception.  The man has direct discourse with the boy and fails to recognize his child, leaving the boy to deal with feelings of hate, resentment, and unconditional love.<br /><br />In the title story, I Know Somebody in Staunton, a black man who has been schooled all his life by an elderly uncle about the beatings and lynchings surrounding black male/white female encounters decides to live dangerously and pick up a white woman hitchhiker in a bar on his way south to visit the ailing uncle.  As they journey further south and encounter a group of angry, restless white men, the haunting refrains of his uncle's warnings weigh on him and seem to grow stronger as he progresses on his journey.  This story is a history lesson as the author mentions infamous altercations involving Emmit Till, the Scottsboro Nine, James Byrd, and others.<br /><br />More history, in the musical sense, is shared in Rossonian Days, where the author describes a jazz band's trip west to Denver to \\"make it big.\\"  He craftily parallels their trek with their ancestor's trials during the Middle Passage and how the voices and rhythms of jazz and blues greats of today (and he names quite a few) echo the chants and drumbeats of ancient Africa.<br /><br />Although I didn't care for every short story presented (some touched me more than others), I liked Lewis's overall writing style and his compassionate views.

Practical Virtues is a wonderful collection of biblical parables, classic excerpts and quotations from slaves and prominent political, social, and literary giants.  It addresses the age old question, \\"How Are We To Live?\\" by offering practical \\"living virtues with soul,\\"  i.e., those that reflect core values that can be acted upon in daily life and are centered on God and biblical teachings.<br /><br />The book centers on twelve basic virtues:  Courage, Diligence, Faith, Forbearance, Forgiveness, Honesty, Love, Loyalty, Prudence, Responsibility, Service, Trustworthiness.  Each section defines the virtue in layman's terms, synopsizes its importance and relevance in our lives, and provides 5-10 excerpts with constructive tips on how to exercise the virtue following the examples outlined in the passages.  The book cites works of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Anita Hill, Nella Larson, Asha Bandele, Gwendolyn Brooks, Colin Powell, Chester Himes, Rosa Parks, Arthur Ashe, Ann Petry, J. California Cooper, and countless others.<br /><br />I enjoyed and benefited from both the spiritual/moralistic vibe and the historical facets of the book.  I learned a lot regarding African American history, social movement, and challenges - this book encouraged me to research specific topics further.  This is an impressive anthology (even though that was not the intent of the authors) that demonstrates that the faith of our ancestors moved mountains, love sustained them, and biblical and yesteryear wisdom and observations are still relevant and applicable in modern times.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />The Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-12-03

She has worked relentlessly to gain the appointment of Bureau Chief, but so has her cutthroat officemate, Jerrod Wresler.

The racial and political implications of the case have the entire department on pins and needles and Jordan is under<br /><br />tremendous pressure for a conviction.<br /><br />If her professional life isn't stressful enough, her personal life complicates matters more. Her adolescent daughter with raging hormones and daily attitudes spews disrespectful remarks in every conversation of late. Her deceased husband's business partner (Simon), an equally charming and dashing attorney, makes his moves on her and she finds herself falling hard for him. When it doesn't seem like things can get any worse, her 19-year-old son (Trevor)is arrested for murder in a double homicide and her archenemy, Jerrod Wresler, has been assigned to prosecute - which he does with a vengeance. He's looking to win the promotion to Bureau Chief by sending Trevor to death row and humiliating her in the process.<br /><br />Jordan hires Simon for Trevor's defense - but when facts are revealed in her case involving the cop's ex-wife, Simon becomes a prime suspect! Jordan is torn between her professional duties and her personal feelings - she realizes her actions could jeopardize her career, her son's case as he fights for his life, and her chance for love.<br /><br />What follows is a fairly interesting \\"whodunit\\" that kept me guessing until the end.

Author Evelyn \\"Slim\\" Lambright's latest release, \\"The Sweethearts of Soul,\\" returns to Philadelphia and chronicles the trials and tribulations of five sisters who compose the fictionalized 1960's singing group by the same name.  Legs Diamond, a reporter for Black Music Magazine, has been tasked to write a feature article on the all girl group in honor of their receiving the Rock and Soul Foundation's Pioneer Award that will be presented to them in a few months.  Legs soon discovers that the group has fallen apart and the sisters are estranged from Fanya, the oldest sister, and haven't spoken to her in over 30 years.<br /><br />Legs, guided by reporter instincts, suspects there is more beneath the surface and digs for the hidden story.  In a series of one-on-one interviews which evoke a series of flashbacks, she learns of each woman's humble beginnings, hopes, lost loves, joys and disappointments.  The main characters are colorful and vibrant - each has a distinct voice, personality and clear-cut role to play in the novel.  For example, Fanya, the original front woman for the group, was the most driven and determined to make it to the top regardless of who got in the way, or what it took.  As a result, she's a modern day superstar and drama queen.  Ruth, a fighter, still dreams of making a comeback, performing whenever and wherever she can - even in local bowling alleys.  Adeline (Addie), a glamour girl who wears fur coats in the summertime, is a successful realtor and realist.  Venus, plumpish and practical, now a successful seamstress and business owner, is the most level headed of the group and serves as the peacemaker of the family. Brenda (Birdie) is the baby of the family who harbors a tormenting secret that drives her to a point of desperation and madness.<br /><br />Though entirely fictional, Lambright blends in actual 1950's and 1960's musical hits, Philadelphia dance hall locations, and celebrities of the day to give the novel validity.  The Sweethearts of Soul could be any girl group of the 1960's - however, one famous group instantly comes to mind.  In a scene eerily reminiscent of a certain real life group, Fanya, the lead singer, breaks away from the group, dates the manager, goes solo, and hits the big time with mega hits, recording contracts and movie deals.  The remaining members recruit their baby sister, Birdie, to take her place.  The group enjoys moderate success until the Disco Era emerges and pushes them off the charts onto the history pages.  The demise of the group leads to anger and bitterness that stews among the sisters for years.  As they age, the Sweethearts deal with forbidden love affairs, mismanaged money, unpaid royalties, issues with their children, drug use, and heated sibling rivalry.  A subplot involving their children and Legs's childhood friend, Roe, heightens the intensity of the story - however, the central theme to the book is the inescapable bond of sisterhood, as evidenced in their united efforts to help a sister in crisis and push pettiness aside to allow their family wounds to heal, just as they had done throughout their childhood.<br /><br />This is a witty, reflective, nostalgic novel that transports the reader back to the glory days of the Motown Era, complete with warm doses of sisterly love and girl group internal squabbles.  Unfortunately, The Sweethearts of Soul does not reclaim the glory and wonder of Lambright's debut novel, The Justus Girls, but it has enough clever dialogue and suspense surrounding the buried secrets of the group, as well as the modern day secrets concerning their children and Birdie to keep the reader interested until the end.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubs of Soul could be any girl group of the 1960's - however, one famous group instantly comes to mind.

Originally founded by light-skinned (\\"high yellow, lemon\\" colored) former slaves, Lemon City, Virginia is cleaver backdrop for Brown's moralistic, social messages.  The quirky self-contained and self-educated residents live by a set of 10 rules (upheld as stringently as the Ten Commandments) designed to protect and insolate their residents from the ills of the outside world and its awful sins.  The rules are simple:<br /><br />1. Never marry an outsider.  If you do, the boll weevil will bite you back.<br /><br />2. If you cannot be honest, you might as well be dead.<br /><br />3. Airing your dirty laundry out in the street will smell up the neighborhood.<br /><br />4. Do not let the Mojo lady know you got troubles.  If you do, she'll give you more.<br /><br />5. Cheating makes you lower than a dog scratching up a worm in the dirt.<br /><br />6. What goes around will always come back around and hit you in the head.<br /><br />7. Help those in need and never judge them by the holes in their socks.<br /><br />8. Do business at home first, then with outsiders you can invite into your home, as a last resort.<br /><br />9. Mind your business personally and professionally.<br /><br />10. Support the community in every way possible and imaginable.<br /><br />However, during the early 1970's, after generations of peace and prosperity, one of the town's youngest and most prominent residents, Faye Dunlap, acts on desires to become part of something bigger and attends college outside of Lemon City (much to the townsfolk dislike).  She embraces the Black Power movement and marries an Outsider (breaking the #1 rule) as ticket out of Lemon City.  This sets off a domino effect of events that upsets the delicate balance of Lemon City; every rule is broken with disastrous results.  Faye's husband ends up dead and everyone in her immediate family is a suspect.  Her hidden agenda is  exposed and she must make some tough decisions.<br /><br />This is a funny, witty, engaging tale about conformity, family love and values, and a sense of community and reciprocity.

If one believes that some people are truly destined for greatness regardless of their station in life, then Dr. May Edward Chinn is a perfect example.  May is conceived as a \\"love child\\" of a married middle-aged former slave and an orphaned teenaged Indian maiden.  The shame of their affair forces her parents to relocate to Harlem only to meet unemployment, impoverished living conditions, and rampant racial discrimination.  Despite her father's negativism, chauvinistic views, and emotional abandonment, it is her mother's tenacity and belief in education that propels young May to become proficient in her studies and master the piano.  Her dreams of studying at Julliard on a music scholarship are crushed by an unplanned teenaged pregnancy in which she unwillingly gives the child up for adoption.  She eventually drops out of high school due to a lengthy bout of depression stemming from the adoption and deferred dreams.<br /><br />Fate intercedes and through several well-timed networking opportunities along with a little name-dropping (and/or perhaps coincidence), she applies, is accepted, and enrolls at Columbia to study music only to be harassed by a racist professor.  However, when one door closes, a window opens and through a series of what could be considered \\"divine\\" interventions, she changes her major to science and the rest is history.  She eventually becomes the first African American female doctor in New York City and a  renowned medical pioneer - however, her road to success is an arduous journey filled with racism, colorism, sexism (even from African American men), financial burdens, and familial strains which the author construes with great sentiment.  There are wonderful episodes in which she falls in love, tours with Paul Robeson, dines with Zora Neale Hurston, and parties with famous Renaissance-era Harlemites like Jean Toomer, Fats Waller, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes.<br /><br />Hausley's writing and overall biographical presentation is suburb!  Compassion and respect exude in her the depiction of Dr. Chinn, the woman; and the utmost humility is conveyed in the stories of her personal and academic trials and tribulations.  Albeit, I found the pacing a bit slow at times, I quickly realized that this is not a story that should be rushed.  It is history and Haulsey took her time to create an authentic early 20th century setting, complete with social attitudes, and wonderful descriptions of New York City's sites, sounds, language, and particularly Harlem's colorful clientele.

Set in Jackson, Mississippi, Blood on the Leaves weaves around wonderfully drawn three-dimensional characters amid social injustice and long suppressed memories.  The catalyst is in the actions of one charismatic Professor Martin Matheson, a disputatious community leader, who uses his classroom as a medium to resurface 30-40 year old unsolved crimes involving murdered/lynched blacks.  He wantonly distributes the names and addresses of whites suspected of carrying out theses deadly deeds and when the white named suspects are murdered in similar manners as the black victims, pandemonium breaks loose and Matheson is arrested and charged with murder.  The community is immediately split along moral and racial divides.<br /><br />The core of the story centers on theatrical courtroom scenes of Professor Matheson's trial; however, it is the internal struggles of the key characters that add depth and drama to the plot.  For example, prosecuting attorney James Reynolds is the only black assistant DA with an impeccable win ratio and is also a social acquaintance of the defendant.  Reynolds is assigned to prosecute Matheson against his wishes by his racist and inept boss (the County's District Attorney).  He suffers from haunting, sleep-depriving nightmares, and wrestles with his own internal morals regarding justice and duty.  Todd Miller, Matheson's defense attorney, is a white Civil Rights lawyer who was disowned and disenfranchised by his family in the 1950's for his liberal political views.  Stetson also interjects ingenious subtle references to and commentaries on modern day political groups and social issues that trigger deep internal examination on the reader's part.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Stetson!  This book is extremely well done - a true page-turner until the very end!  When I finished Blood on the Leaves, I was emotionally drained but thoroughly entertained!  Stetson's skill as a playwright brought the story to life via dialogue, carefully crafted scenes and vivid imagery.  It is a suspenseful, thought-provoking story that grapples with age-old concepts of revenge, redemption, and morality!  This book is most definitely on my 2004 favorites list and I am looking forward to the next release.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubvivid imagery.

Rarely does a prequel deliver with such fervor and depth!  To explain how One Day I Saw A Black King character, John King, came to be, Ms. Mason takes us back to 1931 Bueller, Texas to examine the intricate shenanigans of John's grandfather, the very good-looking and equally hard-working Charles.  He is every woman's dream, including a conniving, teenaged beauty, Roberta, who upon her eccentric mother's suicide has resided with the local midwife for the past 10 years.  Every man has a weakness and Charles has a penchant for pretty women - thus this story centers around the three beautiful women in his life:  Nadine, Roberta, and Sara.<br /><br />Without telling the entire story and giving away the page-turning secrets, let us just say that after Nadine's untimely death, the grieving Charles succumbs to one night of passion that results in a loveless marriage to Roberta.  Charles accepts this miserable existence until he meets Sara Tate - and their instant attraction leads to scandal, another murder, and the conception of Adam (John King's father).<br /><br />This is a story that had me turning pages until the very end - it was perfectly paced, contained full bodied characters with their own agendas (which usually involved sticking their noses in other people's business), and included just enough voodoo and old wives tales to keep a ethereal vibe flowing just beneath the surface as each of the main characters truly wrestled with their own demons through out the book.<br /><br />I truly hope Ms. Mason keeps her creative juices flowing and gives us another wonderful story of how Connie Rogers came to be.  Nonetheless, I'll be anxiously awaiting her next release (regardless of the topic)...as she has rightfully a place on my favorite author's list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-10-04

Johnson, Jr.  A man who was wrongly convicted of rape and sentenced to live in prison in 1983 and spent 16 years there until DNA testing proved him innocent.<br /><br />Johnson's reflections on the criminal justice system are eye-opening, heartbreaking, and extremely frustrating.  He candidly reveals the cruel realities of prison life (work conditions reminiscent of yesteryear \\"chain gangs,\\" rules for survival, and prison etiquette), conveys the shame and embarrassment of his ordeal, and the isolation and sadness he felt being away from family and loved ones.<br /><br />The story follows a chronological path opening with reflections on his early years as a son of an Ohio senator who was also prominent lawyer and community leader.  His mother was totally dedicated to the family and home.  He recounts the good and the bad: meeting Hank Aaron as a boy, achievements in high school athletics, deejaying at a local radio station as a teenager, the college years, and an addiction to marijuana that eventually lead to a conviction.<br /><br />He details his first conviction on drug related and burglary charges and the subsequent railroading he underwent on the rape charges.  His case is riddled with legal complications and countless delays which led to severe financial and emotion strain on his family.  Almost by luck, he was introduced to Project Innocence, a nonprofit legal clinic, and is eventually exonerated by DNA testing.<br /><br />This book is a harrowing story of one man's fight for freedom in a racially clouded, economically biased court system. Johnson, now an ordained minister, cites his unwavering faith in God and his family's love and support as the thrusts which carried him through some tough times.  He expresses no bitterness towards his accusers and continues to work on the Georgia Project Innocence program.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO Bookclub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-08-25

Practical Virtues is a wonderful collection of biblical parables, classic excerpts and quotations from slaves and prominent political, social, and literary giants.  It addresses the age old question, \\"How Are We To Live?\\" by offering practical \\"living virtues with soul,\\"  i.e., those that reflect core values that can be acted upon in daily life and are centered on God and biblical teachings.<br /><br />The book centers on twelve basic virtues:  Courage, Diligence, Faith, Forbearance, Forgiveness, Honesty, Love, Loyalty, Prudence, Responsibility, Service, Trustworthiness.  Each section defines the virtue in layman's terms, synopsizes its importance and relevance in our lives, and provides 5-10 excerpts with constructive tips on how to exercise the virtue following the examples outlined in the passages.  The book cites works of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Anita Hill, Nella Larson, Asha Bandele, Gwendolyn Brooks, Colin Powell, Chester Himes, Rosa Parks, Arthur Ashe, Ann Petry, J. California Cooper, and countless others.<br /><br />I enjoyed and benefited from both the spiritual/moralistic vibe and the historical facets of the book.  I learned a lot regarding African American history, social movement, and challenges -- this book encouraged me to research specific topics further.  This is an impressive anthology (even though that was not the intent of the authors) that demonstrates that the faith of our ancestors moved mountains, love sustained them, and biblical and yesteryear wisdom and observations are still relevant and applicable in modern times.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-08-16

A prominent, award-winning African American Dartmouth etiologist is murdered in rural Vermont and his brother, FBI Special Agent, Sterling Bledsoe, spearheads the investigation.  When circumstantial evidence points to white supremacists, Sterling senses a cover-up and digs deeper to find the truth.  The story then follows his methodical steps as he conducts interviews, observes autopsies, and delves into his famous brother's clandestine research project involving thousands of dead blackbirds found in the local woodlands.<br />Sterling's adventure turns sour when mid-way through the case he becomes the prime suspect and goes on the lam from the law.  Thus, we are thrust from the bucolic comfort of Hanover to the familiar, crowded streets of New York City for safe haven until our hero could gather his thoughts and plot his next moves.  He uses his resources wisely calling on old and new acquaintances to piece together the clues all the while avoiding FBI, local, and intra-state police.<br />The backdrop of the story is the strained relationship of Sterling and his older brother, Wilson.  Serious sibling rivalry, parental neglect, and unresolved bitterness has plagued Sterling all his life.  Wilson's untimely murder only adds to  his already burdened psyche breaking his concentration at inopportune moments, not to mention a love interest that causes distractions as well.<br />Although the resolution of the mystery was somewhat predictable, I was pleasantly shocked by one of the co-conspirators.  So obviously there are some unexpected twists and turns in the plot that yield surprising results.  This is a great \\"whodunit\\" for a first time author; I loved the ecological, suspenseful flavor of the novel.

Set in the late 1960's, Violated by Guitele Rahill, is a glimpse into the lives of three multi-generational Haitian women who exist in the impoverished bowels of Port-au-Prince.  This is a very short, sad but touching novella that depicts how the cyclical effects of colorism, sexism, classism, and incest adversely affect their lives.<br />Henri Berceuse is a dark-skinned, local cinema owner who, despite a destitute childhood, has improved his status by marrying well and acquiring his wife's businesses.  It seems commonplace that men like Henri are entitled to have mulatto mistresses for sexual favors which ultimately bear lighter-skinned children.  Henri changes women as often as the seasons, and ultimately chooses Peggy, a poor, illiterate, sixteen-year-old light-skinned beauty.  Peggy has learned a hard lesson that being pretty, light-skinned, and poor can attract unwanted attention.  She was abducted and imprisoned by government guardsmen as a young teen and sexually abused for six months - only to be released when it became visibly obvious that she was pregnant.  A homemade concoction induces an abortion which caused more isolation and scorn from her friends and family.<br />Peggy, unfortunately, attracts the attention of Henri, who strikes a deal with Peggy's mother (Mimi).  Mimi is a long-suffering victim of domestic abuse along with her thirteen children.  She sees few options and literally agrees to prostitute the child in a sex for money arrangement with Henri who agrees to provide funds to Mimi to sustain and educate Peggy and her twelve remaining siblings.  Peggy moves into the \\"love nest\\" with Henri and ties to her family are instantly severed.<br />Rahill provides hints on the bloody civil unrest during the Papa Doc Duvalier regime.  Henri's self-imposed exile to the United States during this same time leaves Peggy abandoned, penniless, and pregnant with his child, a daughter named Kasha.  Peggy, desperate for money, befriends a married tailor (Antoine), who physically and mentally abuses her just as Mimi underwent in her marriage.  Antoine molests Kasha for years while Peggy turns a blind eye.  It is only in the last few pages of the novella that a glimmer of hope is revealed; otherwise, this story is mired in despair.<br />Rahill blends Kreyol linguistic expressions, folklore, and colorful imagery into a revealing saga about the disenfranchisement and abuse of Haitian women and children - rich and poor alike.  Despite a few punctuation errors, some faulty dialogue handling, it still proved to be an educational and extremely moving read.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub<br />The Nubian Circle Book Clubine), who physically and mentally abuses her just as Mimi underwent in her marriage.

The Gotham Diaries is Tonya Lewis Lee and Crystal McCrary Anthony's debut into the \\"Chick Lit\\" genre.  It is most definitely a perfect choice for a summertime getaway-a mixed blend of soap-opera type drama with a combination of middling to quite flamboyant and comical characters.<br />The plot mainly centers on an extremely ambitious, gay, high-end real estate broker (Manny), a recently widowed and indebted socialite (Tandy), and an \\"in-search-of-self\\" naive billionaire's wife (Lauren).  Lauren believes Manny and Tandy are her friends, but each one has their own self-serving agenda.  The reader is pulled into uptown living through Manny's social calendar, client drama, and his relationship with his boy-toy, supermodel lover.  Manny is largely driven to keep his lover happy (usually with expensive gifts) and secure his place among Manhattan's elite regardless of the costs.  Tandy's plan to remain on top of Manhattan's social circle despite being penniless involves both Manny and an unsuspecting Lauren.  Lauren's desire is to pursue a career amid restlessness and aching suspicions that her husband who is thirty years her senior is having an affair.<br />After establishing each of the key character's history, the focus of the story is shifted to a real estate deal that reeks of betrayal and deception and will cause dissension among the \\"friends.\\"  The last one standing comes into their own and serves their own brand of justice - destroying the hopes and dreams of the others in the process.<br />This is a refreshing and often times funny novel with a strong underlying intensity that yields a page-turning reading experience.  Hopefully this isn't the last we hear about the affairs of Tandy, Manny, and Lauren - I'd like to see more of them soon.  (...)	2004-06-25

Wells's Soul Food for the Soul \\"Sistah\\" is a celebration of African American Woman (AAW) and is largely an inspirational piece comprised of three major sections.  The first section consists of 365 daily affirmations and expressions that inspire self-esteem, self-love, and good mental and physical health. I'd rate this part of the book a \\"4\\" because I found it to be a worthwhile spiritual stimulant.  However, the author then chooses to include nearly 60 pages in workbook format to allow the reader to capture responses to each of the 365 affirmations.  Although I understand the intent, a great deal of paper and empty space was dedicated to this area.<br />The second section was a collection of short poems dedicated to the essence of African American womanhood; each addressed a different phase of womanliness:  the lover, mother, grandmother, sister, etc and the internal and physical beauty of the African American Woman.  If read aloud, one could easily slide into the spoken word pulse and rhythm of the pieces and give life to the written word.  The poems were sincere, melodic, and honest.  I'd rate this section a \\"4\\".<br />The last major section is a very lengthy questionnaire that offers thought-provoking questions regarding the progress and role of the African American Woman in society, politics, relationships, etc., but stops there with no discussion, commentaries, or guidance from the author.  He simply solicits reader feedback to the questions and stresses the importance of inner peace, self-love, and spiritual growth in one sentence at the end of the book.<br />The book also contained some editorial errors (punctuation and awkward sentence structure) and very elementary, hand drawn sketches that I had difficulty connecting to the passages.  So if these faults can be overlooked, one can surely gain some spiritual uplift from one or more aspects of the book.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub<br />Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-06-10

It contains shared experiences, suggestions, and solid advice gained from Harris, ten of her closest colleagues (The Talented 10), and survey results from over 250 women in areas of job interviewing, promotions/breaking the glass ceiling, networking, financial management, stress management, etc.<br />The lessons learned synopses at the end of each chapter are appropriate and essential bits of information for professional development at all stages, while her self-assessment tips are focused and aligned to help individuals reach their specific career goals.  Even though some of her techniques and tips are common practice (creating a personal mission statement, career outline, etc.), she often accentuates those sections with down-to-earth wisdom and bare-bones facts - citing real world scenarios and outcomes, on-the-job incidents and personal testimonies to make her points clear and applicative.<br />Like Harris, I, too, am in a technical, male-dominated career field and could relate to her experiences and challenges within the engineering field.  Additionally, I found Harris's philosophies and trials similar to my own and immediately appreciated what she was trying to accomplish by writing this book.  I also found her guidance and recommendations on point and essential for any woman of color - particularly Black women - because she nailed key strategies and best practices that should be mastered early and sharpened throughout one's professional career regardless of the industry.<br />An added bonus is Harris opens the door to allow readers to network with members of The Talented 10 and herself.

Camilla's Roses, Bernice McFadden's latest release, is told in three parts:  the present day when Camilla's husband discovers a lump in her breast, a flashback to the haunting past that she would rather erase, and a return to present day to face reality and her future.  Camilla's middle name is Rose and all the women on her maternal side share the same middle name honoring a one-of-a-kind rosebush that only prospers and blooms on her great-great grandmother's land in Southern Georgia despite being stolen and clipped many times over the years.<br />Camilla suffers from an identify crisis and abandoned her family ten years ago.  However, after learning about her childhood, one can understand her self-imposed exodus.  Raised in a house full of cousins by her maternal grandmother (Velma Rose) and great aunt (Maggie Rose), Camilla seldom saw her heroin-addicted parents (Audrey Rose and Leroy Brown) and when she did, the results of the visits were disappointing and heartbreaking.  Her childhood experiences causes her to develop an identity crisis that leads to serious skin bleaching and lying - to her friends about her family situation and to herself which proves to be most damaging.<br />With her usual flair, McFadden cuts to the core of humanity and deals with raw pain, loss, and suffering.  This book deals with a multitude of issues: breast cancer, the affects of drug addiction, abandonment, self-hate, infidelity, etc.  Every character is fully developed with a rich history and strong role in the plot - making it a well told story.  The subject matter is dark and harrowing, but there is a silver lining embedded between the lines -- despite the despair, like the rose bush planted so long ago, Camilla and her \\"Roses\\" are made with a strong constitution and we are left with a glimmer of hope that they will be all right.<br />(...)	2004-06-07

The story opens at Reesy and Dandre's long awaited wedding but before the \\"I Do's\\" can be exchanged an incident from the past rears its very UGLY head and the excitement begins.  Files opens a floodgate of drama and it never stops throughout the book.<br />It seems like Reesy's marital woes and personal trauma permeate everyone around her and no one close to her is left unscathed.  In this episode, although the spotlight is primarily on Reesy, it is almost equally shared with some familiar and new supporting characters.  Surprisingly, the dynamic duo, Tyrone and Tyrene (Reesy's high-profile attorney parents), experience a crisis so devastating that their very foundation is threatened, while Reesy's sassy grandmother opens the closet exposing some familial skeletons that are eyebrow-raising (to say the least).  Fans will learn more about Misty's husband, Rick, who has unmentionable issues that threaten their marriage; Dandre's physician father and his fantasies; and a new character, Sleazy, a stand-up comedian, who, despite his stage name, actually comes through in a big way.<br />As with the other Reesy/Misty books, Files upholds her tradition of keeping the novels fresh and funny by interjecting the latest and most hip language, musical references, and urban expressions in her dialogue and settings.  Yet, her appeal continues to be universal as this episode is well written and perfectly paced making it a real page-turner.

Weighing in at about 160 pages, it covers a variety of topics (some better than others) in a variety of forms.  It opens with a multiple-choice quiz to allow readers to determine their ABW type.  The three categories of results align with personality types of both fictional and real women; examples are Mo'Nique/Aunt Esther, Diana Ross/Bernadine (Waiting to Exhale), and Claire Huxtable/Condoleezza Rice.<br />The book continues along this path and highlights a variety of situations ranging from career (managers and coworkers), interpersonal relationships (men and children), and even analogies with angry white women.  Filled with quizzes, lists, and scenarios, it fancies itself as an `in-your-face, no holds barred' synopsis of why black women are angry, what drives them crazy and comedic tips for coping with the madness that ensues.<br />Of course, one should always tread lightly on race relations - dealing with generalities and stereotypes should be handled with care for obvious reasons.  It cannot be argued that the authors took some liberties with their poetic license, because I personally did not find humor in every chapter; thus the middle of the road rating.

Kayla Perrin's latest release, The Delta Sisters, is a multi-generational saga that chronicles the impact of a mother's past sins on her daughter's.  The story opens with a murder of a local promiscuous teenaged girl but quickly shifts focus to widow Sylvia Grayson, a prim and proper New Orleans socialite who wants only the best for her daughter, Olivia.  Olivia must mingle and date within a select group of privileged children, so when Olivia falls in love with &quot;the help&quot; Sylvia outwardly disapproves, separates the two lovers (in a predictable mean-spirited way) and cripples an already fragile mother/daughter relationship.<br />Fast forward nearly thirty years later and we discover a widowed, alcoholic Olivia in an equally dysfunctional relationship with her daughter, Rachelle, from a passionless marriage to a man thirty-years her senior.  Rachelle suffers an identity crisis -- wanting to desperately escape the oppressive household and break family tradition by neither attending the local Dillard University nor pledging the Delta sorority that her great-grandmother helped found and where her grandmother and mother are idolized.<br />The book opened strong with a murder and some hint of Sylvia's secret past, but fizzled when it went off into unrelated tangents and drawn out passages of mother/daughter banter, lost love themes, and occasional hints that a murderer is still afoot.  Nearly 300 pages later, the police reopens the murder case, lost loves are reunited, and Olivia's secrets are revealed -- but at that point, I was ready for the book to end.  I struggled through the shifting focus, slow pacing, and elongated storyline.  In the end, I was disappointed and closed the book thinking &quot;was that it?!?!&quot; While reading, it was also a challenge to understand how and when the title of the book would become relevant to the plot.  I suppose the analogy of the lead characters being sorority sisters and a sorority being like a family (even the dysfunctional ones) is a takeaway, but I still feel somewhat misled by the title because sorority politics and sisterhood principles were addressed so late in the story and played such a small role in the overall plot.<br />Overall, this book was entertaining for a light summer read -- the characters had good intentions and were fairly likable.

However, as much as things change, some remain the same.  Sasha is still dangerously mixing business with pleasure as she did with client/lover basketball star (Michael Jordan-ish), Phoenix Carter, in the Threesome saga.  In Fourplay, she dates a \\"safe\\" banker, Jordan Ashe, a boring, materialistic client who has a dark side and a mysterious Israeli executive, Lyor Turrell, who has a hidden agenda.  The foursome is rounded out with unresolved issues dealing with ex-fianc&eacute; (Trent) and the drama is compounded even more when Lyor attempts to blackmail Phoenix.<br />Although the author attempts to portray Sasha as a savvy, smart entrepreneur who jets across the country to handle her business; this reader noted that she earned her major contracts after she performs sexual favors with her key clients, leaving one to question what true \\"business\\" skills Sasha possesses.  She continually leaves common sense unchecked at the bedroom door and usually ends up used and abused by all of her lovers in some way.  The author depicts her flaws in this manner to show a human, vulnerable side to a woman whose outward appearance would lead people to believe she is in total control and has it going on.  We see her worry about her son, grieve for a father, and suffer debilitating panic attacks that seem to be curable largely with sex and Paxil.<br />Reading between the \\"sexcapades,\\" I found the plot (which mainly consisted of Sasha juggling her lovers and sexual desires) to be weak and somewhat of an afterthought mixed in between the numerous sex scenes.  While I really enjoyed Threesome, I found Fourplay somewhat dull.  However, if you are in the mood for mindless, light erotica then Fourplay could prove to be satisfying.  Also, I think Fourplay will also prove to be more meaningful and pertinent to readers if Threesome is read first.tica then Fourplay could prove to be satisfying.

Life is good for the residents of Cecil Street -- a neat, clean, tree-lined community filled with a close-knit group of law-abiding, hardworking middle class citizens.  The story centers on two families: Joe, Louise and their daughter Shaylala (Shay) live next door to Alberta and her daughter, Bonita (Neet).  Shay and Neet are best friends from infancy, but their 17-year-old bond, along with family marriage vows, religious convictions, and the neighborhood's tenacity are tested when tragedy strikes.<br />The novel opens in the afterglow of a festive neighborhood summer block party -- on the surface, all seems well.  However, within Joe, this magical night has unleashed a longing for his first love and his balm: a mysterious prostitute named \\"C\\" and his music.  He is a former tenor sax musician who seventeen years ago gave up the club life for his wife and family and now suddenly wants to pick up his horn again.  He recklessly engages in an affair with a young, southern belle visiting for the summer in an attempt to recapture the freedom and passion that the previous lifestyle offered.  Louise, Joe's wife, is wrestling with thoughts of Joe's fidelity and her own demons stemming from unresolved childhood issues of loss and abandonment.  Alberta, harboring her own secrets, is the neighborhood outcast who emerges herself and Neet in a cult like \\"fire and brimstone\\" religion to atone for her shady past.<br />Like most of America at that time, Cecil Street has slowly recovered with mixed emotions in the wake of the turbulent political and social outcries that besieged the 1960's.  Their hopes and dreams of a brighter and promising future are entrusted in the next generation.  Outgoing Shay and reserved Neet are nice, college bound, wholesome girls idolized within the neighborhood.  However, when Neet, one of Cecil Street's brightest flowers, nearly dies from a botched abortion performed in the very heart of the neighborhood, Shay and the whole of Cecil Street internalize the tragedy and are thrown back into the reality that reminds them of their shortcomings, misdeeds, and misgivings.  When one of their own hurts, the neighborhood mourns and rallies to ease the pain and initiate the healing.  It is in the healing that each of the characters through several subtle, yet unexpected plot twists resolves their issues with humility and dignity.<br />McKinney-Whetstone uses daydreaming and flashback sequences to reveal the pain of lost loves, suppressed sadness, underlying fear and insecurities of the characters.  She builds delicate layers of complexity with amazing skill and delves into the emotional psyche to deliver wonderfully developed characters - a reader can clearly see their desires, needs, and understand their motivation.  Reader empathy is definitely elicited in this wonderfully blended saga of love, forgiveness, and resolution.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clubies from a botched abortion performed in the very heart of the neighborhood, Shay and the whole of Cecil Street internalize the tragedy and are thrown back into the reality that reminds them of their shortcomings, misdeeds, and misgivings.

Dark Corner is the alias to Mason?s Corner, Mississippi because the town?s population is nearly 90% African American.  It is the namesake of a cruel plantation owner and town founder, Edward Mason.  Its residents are direct descendents of slaves from Mason?s plantation, Jubilee, where Edward Mason was murdered at the hands of his slaves during a revolt and is rumored to haunt the ?big house? at Jubilee.<br />Richard Hunter, infamous novelist, anthropologist, and absentee father, disappeared in a mysterious boating accident; his body is never discovered and he is legally declared dead.  His son, David, inherits both his father?s vast fortune and an overwhelming need to learn more about the father he never knew.  He heads to Dark Corner ? his father?s birthplace ? and location of the family home to begin his quest for discovery.<br />Kyle Coiraut, is a168-year-old vampire - a Frenchman of African lineage who has discovered that his father was a bloodthirsty African warrior enslaved and embittered by the American slave trade who was killed and entombed in Mason?s Corner before Kyle?s birth during a massacre.  Kyle heads to Dark Corner, sets up house at Jubilee, and plans to resurrect his father.<br />David and Kyle are on similar missions ? to learn about fathers they never knew and their fates are ultimately married to this quest.  As one can reasonably deduce, the conditions are set for fireworks to begin as both David and Kyle?s family histories unfold.  Massey skillfully plays on the father-son relationships throughout the book as well as building a credible, suspenseful vampire novel.  Although the story started slowly and our hero, David, was in reactive mode throughout most of the novel; it is an enjoyable horror/vampire saga that ties themes of responsibility, vengeance, good, and evil.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-03-29

It is the story of the Mobley's \\"curse\\" that has besieged their family for generations.  Set in 1920's Johnson Creek, Alabama and spanning four decades, the novel largely focuses on the two younger sisters, Mary Nell and Eva, who possess psychic abilities and often experience the same visions.  Their visions throughout their childhood are prophetic and accurate, but one vision involving Mary Nell's future husband terrifies the girls and threatens to tear the family apart.  Their destinies collide one Sunday in June and the sister's relationship changes forever.<br />At the same time, the oldest sister, Grace, discovers a trunk that contains artifacts from her ex-slave grandmother (Ayo).  Ayo's spirit visits Grace causing her to relive Ayo's horrific middle passage, experiences as a slave (beatings, rapes, etc.) and will eventually drive Grace and her descendants to madness as detailed in Stigmata.<br />The book chronicles the lives of the sisters as they grow into adulthood and how their \\"gifts\\" severely influence their choices in life.  It shows how ill-equipped the parents were at handling their daughters' talents and chose largely to dismiss the signs as insomnia or bad dreams.  While I loved Stigmata, I liked A Sunday in June; although both books were well constructed with compelling plots filled with lyrical prose.  A Sunday in June is not a quick read; it is one that must be absored slowly.  The author's message is deep but rings loud and clear - the pasts affects us all and she emphasizes the importance of seeking resolution and healing from family trauma.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian circle Book Club	2004-03-29

Quantico Rules is a suspenseful thriller set in Washington, DC at FBI Headquarters.  Special Agent Puller Monk is a wonderfully flawed lead character - he is a chronic gambler and professional liar who actually studies to defeat the lie detector tests to hide his illness from his superiors.<br />When the novel opens, Puller is leading the SPIN (Special Inquiries) squad that is conducting a routine background check for an African American Supreme Court nominee who has lied about a three-week unaccountable absence nearly thirty years ago.  Puller's instinct propels him and a trusted rookie agent to dig further despite direct orders from the Assistant Director to wrap up the investigation within seven days.<br />When the college roommate of the nominee admits to keeping a diary which could provide incriminating evidence is murdered and Puller is attacked at the scene of the crime; he chooses to engage Quantico Rules - moreso the breaking of conventional rules and application of unorthodox techniques - to get to the bottom of the conspiracy.  What happens next leads to more murder, mayhem, blackmail, and clues that point to a very unlikely and equally powerful culprit.<br />Puller is a troubled lead character who makes bad decisions but he is a likeable, wounded hero whose actions are well intentioned.  The conspiracy theory within the novel is plausible and the plot is intricately laced with clues and filled with tense moments.  The author delivers solid character development which allows the reader to clearly understand their actions and motives.  This was an enjoyable read - hopefully this will not be the last time we read about the adventures of Puller Monk.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-03-29

Minion: A Vampire Huntress Legend is the first of a new vampire trilogy from L. A. Banks - it is a wonderfully imagined beginning to a new, hip group of vampire slayers.  By day, they are lead by twenty-year-old Damali Richards, who along with her guardians are Spoken Word artists that travel the country performing their craft.  By night, each uses their specialized senses (sight, smell, mental telepathy, etc.) as they collectively hunt vampires and demons using their specialized weaponry.<br />The novel opens with their world succumbing to a powerful, new enemy (master vampire Nuit) who seems to be ravaging corpses and creating a new vampire/demon breed that are more difficult to track and slay.  He also has plans for Damali that could change the world.  Complicating matters is Damali herself who is undergoing a physiological change as she approaches her twenty-first birthday.  The \\"legend\\" blends the spiritual, metaphysical, and incorporates universal messages of balance and harmony.  Equally engrossing as the storyline are the supporting cast - they are an eclectic group - rich and full-bodied with plenty of personality, attitude, and talents.<br />Banks really earns a lot of points for creativity with the revelation of the huntress legend, the &quot;ripening&quot; concept, and with the intricate background and talents of the hunting team and supporting characters.  She creates another world where she defines the order, classes and social strata of demons, vampires, and hell itself.  She brilliantly blends intrigue, romance (with a sensual vibe reserved for vampires), and the right amount of action to deliver a solid foundation to a wonderful upcoming trilogy.

Jake Lamar's Rendezvous Eighteenth is set in modern day Paris's Eighteenth Arrondissement, a beautiful and decadent section of town that underachieving African American Ricky Jenks has chosen to call home for the past ten years.  Ricky is leading a carefree bohemian lifestyle as a musician in a small caf&eacute; until his peaceful existence is interrupted by a desperate phone call from his least favorite cousin, Cassius, a renowned surgeon to the NFL and NBA athletes.  Cassius is looking for his wife (Serena) who has fled to Paris after a heated domestic dispute and offers Ricky a thousand dollars to look in his expatriate circle of friends for clues to her whereabouts.  Good-natured Ricky is immediately drawn into a quagmire that results in him being a suspect in the murder of a transvestite prostitute found in the lobby of his building with keys to his apartment.  Complicating matters is the pregnancy of his French Muslim lover, Cassius's strange business dealings and partners, and the enigma behind Serena's cryptic past and reemergence in Paris.<br />The novel contains excellent characterizations - very full-bodied, rich descriptions that truly bring the characters to life; they have depth, color, and painfully human vulnerabilities.  The cultural, political, and societal issues of Paris's rich multi-ethnic, multi-racial environment were relayed in clever dialogue and within the histories of each character, for example:  a Serbian freedom fighter/mime, an African American woman restaurant owner with a \\"divafied\\" attitude, WWII veterans, a devout Muslim student struggling with worldly desires, etc.  The novel was paced and moved very well - every chapter ended with a mini \\"cliffhanger\\" making it impossible to stop turning pages.  This is a great addition to the crime fiction genre - it had romance, intrigue, and wonderful touches of wit and humor.  This was my first exposure to Mr. Lamar's work - I definitely plan to add his other novels to my reading list.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Clubed by Phyllis<BR>APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club	2004-02-20

In Slave: My True Story, Mende Nazer's spirit echoes that of Sojourner Truth's during her journey from slave to freedom fighter.  The singular difference in their heroic efforts is the span of more than a century.  One would like to believe that humanity would choose to eradicate slavery everywhere, but Nazer is living proof that the horrific institution is thriving in the new millennium.  Nazer, only in her mid-twenties, has spent more than half her life enslaved - held captive against her will by her own countrymen.  Her escape to freedom was largely a stroke of luck but she took it as an omen to tell the world about the widespread slave trade in modern day Sudan.  Her book is an international bestseller in Europe and she hopes its launch in the US will bring about awareness and more supporters.<br />Nazer's autobiography is told with a child-like voice that conveys innocence and honesty.  Told chronologically, it begins with a happy, carefree childhood with her family in remote Sudan.  She shares tribal traditions, wonderful family memories, and her perspective of the Arab and British influence on her people.  She also covers the painful aspects that address female circumcision, poor health care provisions, and infant mortality.  Her childhood is interrupted around 12 years of age (as the Nuba tribe does not record birth dates) when she was abducted and raped in a violent Arab raid on her village and sold into domestic slavery in Khartoum.  There she was physically, mentally, and emotionally abused continuously for eight years serving as housemaid, car detailer, laundress, cook, seamstress, and 24-hour nursemaid; never receiving a vacation or any other compensation.  Sadly the same tactics used during the ancient slave trade are still employed today. Equally effective are the perpetual impoverishment and loss of any familiarity.  Although several opportunities for escape were presented over the years, Mende became too brainwashed and fearful to take advantage.<br />Mende eventually came of age, started to attract the attention of adult male visitors to the household, then was \\"traded\\" to a family in London.  She eventually escaped and was granted amnesty within the UK with aide from fellow Sudanese and British supporters.  One of those supporters, Damien Lewis, is the co-author of the novel.  Both he and Mende dedicate their time and resources supporting human rights organizations and government assemblies.  She has since learned that her parents survived the raid and are alive near her village and communicates with them periodically.  Unfortunately with her sensationalized trial, publicized battle for political asylum in the United Kingdom and the release of the novel, came noteriety that prohibits her from returning to the Sudan.  Thus Mende's ultimate plea for the abolition of slavery everywhere is coupled by a simple desire to see her family again.<br />This is a book is a testimony to a young woman's outstanding courage and unconquerable spirit.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club/>Mende eventually came of age, started to attract the attention of adult male visitors to the household, then was \\"traded\\" to a family in London.

It is a harrowing saga set in the late 1950's in rural Georgia and narrated by a teenaged Tangy Mae Quinn.  Tangy is child number seven from Rozelle (Rosie) Quinn, a beautiful woman who has slept with most of the men in the town resulting in marriage to no one and ten fatherless children by as many men.  Rosie exhibits selfish, erratic behavior leading the reader to believe she is a paranoid schizophrenic, although she is never diagnosed as such in the novel.  Rosie rules the household with an iron fist (and an occasional iron poker) and is mean-spirited and merciless.  Partially because of her mental condition, Rosie brainwashes the children with biblical references to \\"Honor Thy Mother\\" which burdens them with an obligation to forfeit all earnings to Rosie and never abandon her.<br />Although Tangy is the lead storyteller, there are numerous characters with much drama of their own and a subplot surrounding the Civil Rights struggle and school integration.  Phillips also adds the classic theme of \\"colorism\\", in which the options of dark-skinned women in a color-conscious, male-dominated society are limited; however in this novel, Tangy tries to overcome it via education.  There are tantalizing family secrets and vivid descriptions of child abuse which elicits reader empathy for the characters.  I felt the characters' pain as they struggled with suppressed anger/frustrations from the domestic situation with a manipulative, mad mother as well as the social situation regarding second-class citizenry in the segregated South.<br />This is a really good book if you like to read about African American familes and women's issues and struggles.  However, I thought it could have been a great book if the cause of Rosie's dementia was revealed and had more closure on the outcome of key characters.  Perhaps a sequel is forthcoming....if so, I would love to read it.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clubacters.

In 1959, Ruby, poor and pregnant, hastily leaves small town Norma, South Carolina for Oakland, California with her younger half brother (Easton) in tow.  She moves in with her father and his lover and finds work as a seamstress.  Dry then blends in the political and social happenings of the time and we watch how Ruby struggles to hold her family together despite racism, incest, domestic violence, and the influx of drugs in the community.<br />Weighing in at 450 pages, Dry gives the reader a lot to consider.  The interrelationships of the characters are complex and engaging.  Dry provides up close and personal perspectives of the movement through the eyes of a college age Easton when he ventures south to participate in a Civil Rights march in Selma, Alabama.  Another supporting character embodies the Black Panther philosophies; Lida (Ruby's daughter) resorts to prostitution to support a drug habit; Love (Ruby's grandson) grows up with heroin-addicted parents and experiences the juvenile justice system.  Every character has a unique voice/view and a heartbreaking story, which Dry tells with compelling realism.  Interweaved within the story are historical (factual) citations and references that shaped race relations and influenced the Black experience in America.<br /><br />Dry writes with conviction and purpose as evidenced in the title reference and the theme of \\"leaving\\" is echoed in the character's actions, a few examples are:  Ruby's exodus from South Carolina is necessary to avoid racial violence; whereas Love escapes to the same South Carolina to avoid the ills of urban gang life.  Lida's choice to leave Ruby's home is a result of her fleeing pain and unresolved issues; Marcus (Lida's husband) leaves for three years to launch a musical career, etc.<br />This book was simply a good read -- the characters and plot were well developed; pacing was sound and the story moved quickly (which made the 450 pages easier to digest).ood read -- the characters and plot were well developed; pacing was sound and the story moved quickly (which made the 450 pages easier to digest).	2004-01-14

Sheila Williams's sophomore effort, The Shade of My Own Tree is a wonderful, witty story of Opal Sullivan's journey to self-rediscovery after years of physical and mental abuse at the hands of her husband, Ted.  After nearly twenty years, she finally reaches a point when she does not recognize herself in the mirror and decides to leave and begin a new life.  For her new dwelling, she chooses a dilapidated old home in a picturesque river town in need of a lot of work, much like herself.  Renovating the home becomes a therapeutic release and symbolic of healing and reconstruction of her self-identity and esteem.  Along the way, she meets many eccentric characters, some in the form of a \\"divafied\\" realtor, a confederate flag waving geriatric neighbor, a vampire-like boarder, and a bear of a dog that is afraid of his own shadow.<br />She opens her heart and offers her home as a safe haven to other abused women and finds herself giving advice that she herself only months before could not have thought, much less uttered or taken.  Through these acts, she discovers romance, healing, and herself.  Although one of the themes of the story surrounds physical abuse, Williams's novel is sprinkled with the down-home humor and common sense expressions reminiscent of J. California Cooper's wisdom. The Shade of My Own Tree is a splendid story with a delightful sub-plot that is perfectly paced, very well written, and very easy to read.

Nalo Hopkinson's The Salt Roads centers on the spirit, Ezili's (a goddess of love and seduction) emergence in three women throughout time.  The reader gets a glimpse of her in Mer, a lesbian slave woman healer, in the early 1800's on the Caribbean island of St. Domingue (Haiti) during a burial of a stillborn child.  The second appearance is in the 1880's within Jeanne, a mulatto Parisian dancer and mistress to a white poet whose purse strings are controlled by his domineering mother.  The third woman, Meritet, is a prostitute in an ancient (340's A.D.) Egyptian brothel.<br />Although these women exist during different time periods, Ezili seems to emerge, exist, and influence each woman simultaneously.  With Jeanne, she appears in dreams, and wants to live, act, and breathe through her until Jeanne is physically scarred and disabled from the ravages of a sexually transmitted disease.  Mer receives her awakening during a riverside burial ceremony of a stillborn child and Meritet has an instance of self-awareness that allows her to experience the independence of Ezili.<br />Aside from the Ezili storyline, each main character has her fair share of drama, heartbreak, and intrigue.  Each are a victim of circumstance; in worlds that were cruel to the black woman.  Mer deals with the harsh reality of plantation life and the impending slave revolt that secured Haiti its freedom from colonial rule.  The author expertly embeds regional history and folklore into Mer's story.  An aging Jeanne struggles with securing her future as a courtesan in a world in which her skin color places her at a disadvantage and Meritet journeys from whoredom to sainthood.<br />This book is full of symbolism (the incorporation of the value, taste, and healing power of salt, etc. throughout the novel is superb).  It also has a mystical and esoteric feel to it; the stories are heart wrenching and the characters are memorable.  The author embellished a bit at times with the transcendental themes causing lapses that were very vague and abstract; however for those who enjoy heavy, lyrical prose and surreal themes, it is worth picking up.  Overall, it is a wonderfully imagined story that dabbles with the supernatural and issues of self-worth, survival, and redemption.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clubcausing lapses that were very vague and abstract; however for those who enjoy heavy, lyrical prose and surreal themes, it is worth picking up.

Her latest novel, The Good House, examines the consequences of misusing magic and the power of heritage and family.<br />The story is set in the remote town of Sacajawea, Washington where in the early 1900's, Marie Touissant relocates from Louisiana guided by her inner voice to a place that can be described in modern terms as the \\"epicenter of the sprit world\\".  Marie is a trained, experienced, favored vodou priestess and often uses her powers to help and heal others.  Through a series of events, Marie (in anger) misuses her talents, is abandoned by the \\"good\\" spirits for her actions, and unleashes a vengeful, unrelenting evil spirit that is determined to destroy her and her progeny.  Marie watches helplessly as her daughter is possessed and tormented by the spirit.  She patiently waits for the opportunity to redeem herself but time is not her friend and she passes before she can banish the spirit.<br />Fast forward to present day.  Marie's granddaughter, Angela, is clueless about her grandmother's secrets; but when tragedy strikes at the family home (The Good House) and a destructive pattern emerges at the expense of her loved ones, she begins to suspect and believe that there is no such thing as coincidence.  She must quickly discover the cause of these bizarre fatalities, her dead grandmother's role in it, and a method of containing or eradicating the evil before it consumes her and all her loved ones.<br />This book is a suspenseful page-turner from beginning to end.  It is wonderfully conceived and superbly written!!  Due exhibits great expertise when she weaves together the spiritual aspects (Christianity, Vodou, Native American and African/Caribbean spiritualism), the history of the great Northwest, racial sensitivities, and family values.

Until That Good Day by Marjorie Kemper is another sorrowful tale of the \\"tragic mulatto\\" set in the depression-era South.  In this story, we meet John Osceola Washington, a handsome, dashing traveling salesman, who is a seemingly devoted husband and father in the eyes of the residents of Myrtle, Louisiana.  However, John, as his family before him, are light-skinned blacks who have lived as white citizens since Reconstruction.  John has intentionally married white at the urging of his mother to keep their secret safe.  The psychological pressure and societal restraints prevent him from pursuing his true love, a black woman, Odessa, whom he met on his trade route and has romanced for years.  Odessa and a few other suspecting blacks see through John's façade and accept him unconditionally.  The author forebodes that John's luck will hold until that good day when the proverbial dam of lies will break.<br />True to the formula, tragedy strikes John's home and his white wife, Della, dies leaving the care of his two daughters to John.  He relies on support from his aged mother to care for the girls.  Both she and the girls are miserable under this arrangement.  Then when she passes unexpectedly, he quickly remarries a spoiled, selfish, young socialite with \\"ghost white\\" skin, Antoinette, who despises children and black people.  More tragedy ensues and the truth eventually reveals itself (on that good day) in such an obvious event, and it is here we learn the proverbial lesson that people see what they want to see.  The author blends this recurring theme of \\"turning a blind eye to the truth\\" in numerous storylines throughout the novel.<br />This novel is told from varying viewpoints including the two daughter's, Odessa's, Antoinette's, Emmy (the black maid), Gilbert (the gardener) and Antoinette's mother.

The book is the continuing saga of Annette Goode, her family, and her misfit band of friends as she returns to Richland, Ohio after running away to preserve her sanity nearly a decade earlier.  Although Annette has matured and gained more self-confidence, she still harbors the mental and emotional scars left by the pedophile, Mr. Boatwright, and the murderous antics of her best friend, Rhonda.<br />The story opens with Annette making a step toward reconciliation; she travels to Miami to visit with the father who abandoned her and her mother over 30 years ago and meets her long lost half-sister, Lillimae.  The reconciliation theme continues throughout the story as she reconnects with childhood friends Pee-Wee (who she embraces) and Rhonda, the murderer (who she destperately tries to avoid).  However, drama still clings to Annette like a shadow and her life becomes more complicated by the misdeeds of her jaded past, an ill-matched love affair with a penny pincher, and an altercation with a suspected pedophile.  However, Annette is not alone in her despair; there is an expression, \\"misery loves company,\\" and Monroe manifests its essence equally in the subplots involving Lillimae, Rhonda, and newfound friend,Jean.<br />The author skillfully marries the reconciliation theme with one of forgiveness and redemption as demonstrated at the climax of the novel when Annette's past life as a prostitute jeopardizes her wedding.  This event triggers a collapse of the wall of lies she has built, and opens a floodgate of truth the enables healing for every wounded character.  Sacred secrets are revealed, testimonies are shared, and lost loves are reunited.  Annette learns that the truth liberates and the dark cloud of gloom slowly dissipates from her life toward the end of the book, the sun was finally shining in her life after nearly forty years of impediments.<br />This novel is filled with many unforeseen twists and turns which makes it a page-turner.  It proved to be a much anticipated and extremely satisfying follow-up novel, so much so that I do not think Mary Monroe fans will be disappointed.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clubwith many unforeseen twists and turns which makes it a page-turner.

It is set in 1820's Louisiana where Manon Gaudet is wooed and married at an early age to an older gentleman who seems to be smitten with her beauty.  Slavery is commonplace and the laws of the day transfers the woman's property into her husband's estate upon marriage; so although Manon seems to have good business sense, she cannot act to protect her assets and sits idly by as her husband squanders their (her) assets.  It frustrates her even more that her husband has had relations with her \\"property,\\" Sarah, a wedding gift to Manon from her aunt, resulting in the birth of two children.  Sarah has borne a deaf son that bears a cloned resemblance to Manon's husband (including his red hair and green eyes).  There is no doubt that Manon feels trapped in a loveless marriage to a dull, sadistic, indebted, planter.  She outwardly despises her husband, the slaves that serve them, and is utterly miserable with the fate that society has dictated upon her.<br />Time passes and during a slave revolt, Manon is wounded, her husband is killed, and Sarah escapes.  The remainder of the relatively short novel is Manon's wallowing in self-pity as a penniless, maimed widow in a male dominated society and her determination to recapture Sarah under the public guise of missing \\"property\\" that must be returned to the rightful owner.  However, it is here that the reader senses Manon's envy of Sarah and the perceived happiness she has found in her stolen freedom.  Manon's determination to bring Sarah back to fulfill her destiny in the dejected circumstances of Manon's reality is just as cruel as any act her sadistic husband would have committed.  This attitude clearly illustrates that Manon having once felt that she was her husband's property, and empathized with Sarah, cannot and will not rise above her shallowness, racism, and jealousy to allow Sarah peace.<br />This is a short, plausible novel that can be finished in one sitting; however, although it is original and well crafted, it seems to end abruptly without closure. I was left wanting more.  Nonetheless, Martin commands the language of the day, builds a credible cast of characters, and delivers the story with her strong writing skills.

Black Science Fiction by John Faucette, Jr. is no ordinary book, so this will not be an ordinary review.  In all fairness, the author places a warning label on the cover and in the introduction section of his book that should be heeded.  This is not a book for small children.<br />Most of the stories in this volume were of adult themes with sexual and/or violent episodes which could be disturbing to some readers.  The book offers a variety of short stories ranging from other-worldly alien encounters to futuristic reality-based tales.  For example, one of the stories I found enjoyable was entitled, The Promised Land.  It was about an altered state of America in which the Confederates won the Civil War.  The author goes into detailed speculation of how the industrialized South would have benefited and prospered under the laws of institutionalized slavery.  Another was, Cinderella 3000, that put a sci-fi spin on the classic \\"Cinderella\\" story.  He also interjects bits of suspense and wonder in some of the pieces that leaves the reader thinking about the story after it ends.  There are even a few that convey guiding moralistic principles to live by.<br />As one can probably guess, this reviewer enjoyed the stories that were less sexual/violent in nature as his overall storytelling ability (pacing, dialogue handling, short-story plots, etc.) is relatively good.  Some might even consider some of the stories perverse or grotesque; however no one can argue that the author does not have a strong imagination.  He does indeed....so be warned and read at your own risk!<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club<br />July 20, 2003	2003-09-04

Jones's The Known World is a complex, multidimensional story of the interrelationships among slaves, Indians, black and white masters, patrollers, husbands and wives in an antebellum setting in fictional Manchester County, Virginia.  The catalyst of the story is the death of Henry Townsend, a former slave who is mentored by his former owner, William Robbins, the most powerful man in the county.  William Robbins has a white wife and children as well as a black mistress and children with her.  It is no secret to anyone in the county that he spends time with both but prefers the black family, even to the point of educating his black children and his favorite slave, Henry.  Henry's father saves money for nearly fifteen years to purchase his own freedom, his wife's and eventually his son's.  However, as the years pass, Robbins's  influence over Henry is gripping.  After his father's purchase of him, Henry reluctantly leaves Robbin's plantation to live with his parents, but returns to the plantation to visit often.  He grows up into a headstrong young man only to purchase land near his former owner.  Under Robbin's tutelage, Henry purchases slaves for his farm against the wishes of his outraged parents who detest human bondage regardless of the master's race.  When Henry dies young, his widow, Caldonia, succumbs to grief, and the \\"known world\\" of Manchester County begins to unravel.  Henry's most \\"loyal\\" slaves run toward freedom and the black Caldonia must resort to hiring white and Indian patrollers to reclaim her property.  The complexities are heightened by the affair that ensues between Caldonia and her black overseer, the illegal capture and sale of Henry's father back into slavery by roving \\"speculators,\\" and the final outcome of all the key characters and Manchester County itself.<br />The author's storytelling style is interesting as he often reveals the entire history of a character including the trials, tribulations, and sometimes his/her untimely demise before the character acts in the present.  Thus the reader can quickly surmise that particular character's insecurities, motivation, and vulnerabilities. The book is filled with numerous characters, many more than are mentioned in this review; all are similarly interesting and engaging as the aforementioned.  For example, Jones also provides an excellent depiction of the interconnections and mindset of the slaves on Henry's plantation which are equally complex and intriguing as the other white character's relationships.

Pearl Cleage's latest novel, Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do is a tale of recovery, redemption, and a love that transcends time.  Regina Burns, a talented speechwriter, is fresh out of a Washington, DC rehabilitation center and ready to begin her life anew.  She has rebounded from cocaine addiction propelled during a period of depression after breaking up with her fianc&eacute; and having her habit fueled by her inheritance from her recently deceased parents.  Desperate for money, she embraces responsibility and reluctantly accepts a short-term job in Atlanta with her \\"would-have-been\\" mother-in-law (who was really the cause of the break-up) to save her family's home from foreclosure.  If this sounds like a challenge, it is; however add in her visionary aunt's premonition regarding Regina's destiny to save a damsel in distress, slay a dragon, and meet a  handsome man with \\"the ocean in his eyes\\" and the level of complexity, suspense, and drama goes through the roof!<br />This novel is in sync with Cleage's other works, in that she exposes human nature to the bare bones - she skilfully wraps issues surrounding love, class, sexuality, and race into a wonderful story.  Her characters are warm and likeable; her sense of humor is witty and perfectly timed; and her pacing is great.  It is a delightful \\"feel good\\" novel in that in the end the prophesy is fulfilled, cosmic justice is served, and a message on doing the right thing is delivered.

Charlotte Carters mystery, Jackson Park, occurs in the midst of Chicago in the aftermath of the MLK assassination where Black people are still angry and disillusioned, politicians are very nervous, and the city is still smoldering from the riots.  Carters unlikely shero is Cassandra, a college coed; a witty, hippi-ish misfit who is raised by her great-aunt and uncle.  Despite the volatile atmosphere, she clings to optimism and hope so when a request to assist a family friend presents itself, she jumps at the opportunity to help.<br />Danger befalls Cassandra and her family as the seemingly harmless appeal to find a missing girl leads to a decades old murder of a white schoolteacher by a black mentally challenged boy.  While on this adventure, she discovers the boy was wrongly accused, learns of her uncles shady past, and matures on many levels.  We follow a trail that leads to a Black vigilante group (The Roots), dirty politicians, police brutality/corruption and are reminded that as much things change, some things remain the same.<br />I enjoyed the way in which Carter intermingled the old with the new throughout the novel.  She paired the young, idealistic, energetic Black youth with the older, cautious, realistic generation to teach the lessons of discretion and patience.  Through Cassandras eyes and ears, we heard the music of Marvin and Aretha; we saw glimpses of war protesters, civil rights activists, and the emerging womens liberation movement. In as much as this was a walk down memory lane, it was an amusing and suspenseful story that was entertaining and easy to read.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO Book Club, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2003-07-29

It is this reviewer's opinion that Percival Everett's God's Country is nothing short of a mini-masterpiece.  Set in 1871 and narrated by a very unlucky cowpoke, Curt Marder, the book shows the good, bad, and ugly aspects of life in God's Country (the proverbial Wild West).<br />The story opens with marauders burning Curt's ranch, kidnapping his wife, Sadie, and committing the ultimate indiscretion of shooting his beloved dog.  Curt, a spineless coward and ardent racist, does nothing to stop them and watches from a distance as his home is destroyed.  He hires Bubba, the best tracker in the area (who happens to be African American), to lead him to the culprits (and subsequently Sadie) in exchange for half the ranch.  It is in the journey to save Sadie that Curt constantly witnesses and benefits from Bubba's selfless acts of benevolence and humanity, but is blinded by racism, stupidity, and ignorance to realize the errors of his ways.  Instead, he consistently lies, steals, and cheats, largely driven by greed and his own self-interests.<br />Mr. Everett is an excellent writer having pulled off such a spoofy odyssey.  Through his words, the reader experiences the sights, sounds, and smells of hard living in hard times.  It is a relatively short novel that is richly saturated with dark humor and unforgettable, wonderfully imagined characters with names like Wide Clyde McBride, Pickle Cheeseboro, and Taharry whose speech impediment causes him to preface every word with \\"ta,\\" thus earning him his unusual name.  The book even includes a \\"cameo\\" appearance of \\"Injun killin'\\" George Cluster and bank robbers reminiscent of the James/Younger Gang.<br />This book touched on so many issues (the \\"isms\\") on a number of levels.  Through the misadventures of Curt and Bubba, the author covers the institutionalized racism and social injustices that Native, Asian, and African Americans endured.  There are painful scenes of an Indian tribe massacre and a lynching of an innocent black boy.  The sexism exhibited against women in the West was evidenced in the Jake and Loretta storylines, and the emerging socio-economic strata (classism) between western landowners was touched upon as well.  However, for me, the most powerful messages were saved in the last few pages of the novel's surprise ending.  Without revealing too much, I thought it was clever in the way that the author paralleled Bubba's \\"dream\\" to live freely without fear or judgment to MLK's desire to be judged by the content of one's character and not by skin color.  Curt comments that Bubba's dream did not sound like much of a dream summed up the underlying arrogance and indifference toward his fellow man that resonated throughout the story.<br />This is the second book I have read by this author and I have not been disappointed yet.

John Ridley's Those Who Walk In Darkness is a futuristic, sci-fi thriller filled with superheroes and super cops in a battle between good and evil.  Soledad O'Roark is a tough, no-nonsense rookie on an elite team of police officers whose sole mission is to capture and deport metanormals.  Metanormals are humans who have altered genetic traits which enable them to perform extraordinary feats, like fly, manipulate elements (metal, fire, water), become intangible (move through solid objects), etc.  However, the most feared and deadly of the metanormals is the telepath who can enter the mind and take total control of one's actions, emotions, and thoughts with little to no warning.  If you are picking up a strong \\"X-Men\\" vibe, then you are right on point.<br />In this novel, San Francisco and its half million \\"normal\\" humans were obliterated from the face of the earth when the good superheroes failed to stop an evil superhero's doomsday device.  Thus in a knee-jerk decision, the President issues an Executive Order to deport the metanormals.  Europe openly accepts those who are deported, while others hide their capabilities and try to live peacefully incognito in the U.S.  However, the \\"normal\\" humans (especially the cops) spew so much malice toward any metanormal whether good/helpful or destructive/evil that there is usually conflict in every meeting that ends in a lot of cops dead when trying to capture one metanormal.<br />Most of the story centers on the heroine Soledad; her life and motivation.  We learn that she is the typical hard-nosed, loner, idealist cop who believes in \\"the system\\" until a series of events leads her to love, threatens her career, and changes her life.  The plot's formula is familiar and so are the supporting characters - there is a \\"lover boy,\\" a dedicated family man, and a \\"Rambo\\" type to round out Soledad's four-person crew.  At times, I felt like I was reading a screenplay for a new cop show - there were plenty of \\"shoot `em up\\" action passages, characters with misguided anger, and the resonating \\"woe is me\\" lament of misunderstood policemen.  The story works reasonably well because I kept reading to find out what was going to happen next.<br />True to Ridley fashion, this novel has plenty of comedic scenes and a darker side.  It raises issues of human rights and challenges the reader to examine social injustices of the past and potentially the future.

Salome Thomas-EL's  I Choose to Stay: A Black Teacher Refuses to Desert the Inner-City  is a testament of selfless dedication and commitment to Philadelphia's inner-city community.  He opens by recapping his childhood and ever-present internal drive to succeed despite the obstacles in his path.  Born into a large family with little money and an absentee father, Mr. Thomas-EL excelled academically and stayed out of trouble as a youth.  His record of accomplishment earned him respect from instructors who encouraged him to live up to his potential despite peer pressure to do otherwise.  He credits his mother and teachers as having the greatest influence on his life and has made it his mission to reciprocate all the many blessings he has received.<br />He shares that early in his life he felt he was destined to teach and cites a few early adult experiences that seemed to confirm the inevitable.  His innovative academic programs, strong rapport with students, and love of teaching led him to become an effective and influential educator and role model.  Mr. Thomas-EL meticulously chronicles the resurgence and accomplishments of the Vaux Chess Team and the strategies that he used to encourage and develop the students' skills for the game and life's hard lessons.  As stated in the foreword written by Arnold Schwarzenegger, there is no doubt that Salome Thomas-EL is to be commended for his tireless efforts and devotion to the children of Vaux Middle School.  Written in the same vein of Joe Clark's Lean On Me, Thomas-EL's I Choose To Stay is proof that inner-city public schools can succeed and produce great students.<br />Although Thomas-EL's story is truly inspirational, it is the construct of the book or memoir that distracts from the story.  There are some passages and concepts that are repeated and the  story's flow stalled in a few areas.

It explores the popular biblical parable of Jesus and the woman at the well but expounds upon the unnamed woman's life in ancient times under the rule of the Romans and laws of Moses.  In the novel, the author gives her a name, Maryam, and delivers a well-developed character who struggles with self-identity, conformity, and the newly discovered Christian values of forgiveness, universal love, and equality.<br />Maryam was born with \\"gibora\\" - a strong, outgoing, free spirit; something that women are not to possess or openly demonstrate in a male-dominated society; thus she is taught to suppress it in order to avoid shaming her father/family and to make her more desirable as a potential wife.  With no protection from an abused and broken mother, the young Maryam is wed to a lecherous, spoiled husband and is subjected to his perverse sexual demands.  Although she tries her best to appease her husband, he exercises his right to \\"erwat dabar\\" and is publicly divorced.  Consequentially, she is cast aside by society's communal laws, disowned by her father, and falls victim to public scorn resulting in her name becoming synonymous with impropriety.  She is clearly a victim of poor circumstances and hard luck and even the most discerning reader is compelled to empathize with her trials and tribulations.  Her next four marital relationships are wonderfully conceived and creatively written by the author.  They provide much food-for-thought regarding the woman's role within marriages and in ancient Hebrew society.<br />Hendricks cleverly intermingles modern day African American vernacular and misguided values regarding skin hues, racial superiority, etc. which add practicability to an otherwise archaic story.  Maryam struggles with oppression (to the point of nearly losing herself) and concepts of conformity throughout her life and receives the answers to her lifelong questions during her encounter with Jesus.  Through Him, she finds renewed strength and courage to share the message of forgiveness, gender/race equality, and universal love among the very villagers who disparaged her.<br />This is a powerful story of strength, redemption, and liberation with a message that will transcend time.

I had not read his debut novel, Drop, or any of the press releases surrounding his latest work, so I blindly opened the book and began reading. I soon found myself laughing aloud and engrossed by the author's clever imagination, mature writing style, and original characters. Johnson builds a story that is both interesting and thought provoking - a true challenge for a tough and controversial topic such as gentrification.<br />Hunting In Harlem is the story of Horizon Realty's vision to revitalize Harlem one brownstone at a time; hoping to eventually return it to the booming community it once was during the Renaissance. The realty company is also a sponsor of the Second Chance Program and subsequently employs three ex-convicts as part of a real estate training program. Snowden (convicted of manslaughter for killing his father), Bobby (an arsonist), and Horus (a former gangbanger) are handpicked to participate in this prestigious, cutting edge, year-long program. As they study the ins-and-outs of real estate, they also perform extra assignments, such as clearing out Horizon apartments of tenants who happen to perish in freak accidents. The suspense begins when Snowden mentions the number of accidental deaths to his love interest who happens to be a reporter. She investigates and discovers a pattern which leads Snowden to confront his mentor. He soon learns that it is Horizon Realty's plan to dispose of \\"undesirables\\" (people who discredit Harlem) and is blackmailed into supporting their plot to meticulously remove the offenders (prostitutes, pick pockets, child abusers, drug dealers, etc). Conflict arises as the three convicts must determine how to handle the truth, come to terms with their direct involvement in the murders, and think of a way to escape blackmail.<br />This book challenges the intellectual to revisit the classic debates surrounding \\"sacrifices for the greater good of society\\" and infamous \\"by any means necessary.\\" Johnson also educates by sharing the history of Harlem and provides an explanation of how and why it is in its present condition. Throughout the book were subtle lessons in gentrification, discussion of the African-American socio-economic condition, and even a discussion of DuBois's Talented Tenth theory. These topics and other ethical dilemmas were skillfully crafted in the dialogue and thoughts of the colorful, strong, wacky characters. It can also be said that this novel is an examination on human nature as we follow the central characters' development and watch them wrestle with moral issues.<br />This is an intriguing, suspenseful, well-written novel. The author's writing style, social messages, and storytelling ability makes this a book worth picking up.

In his book, The Nickson View II, Victor Nickson rises to the challenge and jumps headstrong into the controversial reparations debate.  He tackles the \\"Horowitz-10,\\" which is a term that refers to the 2001 publication of David Horowitz's 10 Anti-Reparations points which can be summarized into four principles concerning racial generalizations, divisiveness, gratitude, and victimization.  Nickson meticulously addresses each point and highlights flaws within the Horowitz argument.<br />For example, the author dispels Horowitz's claim that \\"There Is No One Group That Benefited Exclusively from [Slavery's] [sic] Fruits\\" and implies that blacks were the primary beneficiaries of slavery.  Nickson uses census records from several decades to demonstrate the consistent gap in salaries, home ownership, education, and other indicators of wealth.  He also uses sources to speculate the wealth those black Americans would have created if they had been free from slavery when they came to the United States, and hints at the global devastating impact that the slave trade had on Africa.<br />Another example is Horowitz's assertion that implies \\"The Historical Precedents Used to Justify the Reparations Claim Do Not Apply, and the Claim Itself Is Based on Race Not Injury.\\"  Nickson points out that although slavery legally ended in 1863 with the Emancipation Proclamation, Jim Crow laws and de facto segregation did not end until the 1970s.  He maintains that all blacks living today either experienced segregation, or are the children of people whom segregation directly affected.  Nickson cites the pattern of housing, the discrimination in employment, the resistance to equal opportunity in education, the racial profiling, the inequities in the administration of justice, and the widespread opposition to affirmative action as indicators that historical precedence does and should apply as injury has been done.<br />Nickson provides compelling arguments in great detail for each of Horowitz's points and constructs his counterpoints with care, facts, and compassion.  Of course, some will not agree with the author's justifications and conclusions, but one cannot argue that Mr. Nickson's work is well researched, properly documented, and presented reasonably well.  He uses a variety of sources to substantiate his cases, including the Bible, to parallel the plight of the ancient Hebrews to the African Diaspora.  Although small in size, this book is not lightweight.  It is an excellent resource for the intellectuals, the scholars, social scientists, or anyone interested in the reparations debate.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club's points and constructs his counterpoints with care, facts, and compassion.

Dr. Center-Shabazz explains the notion of financial savviness in her book, Let's Get Financial Savvy!, using this adage, &quot;You can take a million dollars from a rich man and chances are he will regain it within a year.  You can give a million dollars to a poor man and chances are he will lose it within a year.&quot;  The difference between the two is financial savvy.  Concisely, financial savvy comes from knowledge and knowledge is power.  The purpose of the book is to empower others to claim and retain their &quot;savviness&quot;.<br />I think this book is an excellent resource for beginners who desire an understanding of financial concepts because it is not a comprehensive &quot;how-to&quot; guide.  The author provides some budgeting formulas and worksheets that are largely self-explanatory and rudimentary.  She does a great job dissecting complex topics and restating them in layman's terms to ensure thorough comprehension.  She also covers the basics by featuring numerous financial topics ranging from budgeting (cash flow and debt management) to retirement and investment planning.  Simply stated, she tells the reader what should be done without all the details on how to make it happen.  This approach may be too elementary for the experienced investor who may be looking for advanced strategies and tactics.  For example, on the subject of mutual funds, she discusses the benefits, types, and other fund aspects and then instructs the reader to &quot;read  a lot of mutual fund reports&quot; without providing an example of how to analyze such a report to understand the terminology, indicators, or components of such reports.  This reviewer is of the opinion that advice like this is akin to a parent briefing their teenager on the benefits of car ownership and then handing them the manuals to the GM models to read on their own.<br />Nonetheless, the author's enthusiasm and dedication toward personal enrichment shines through in the book.  Her &quot;can do&quot; attitude, illustrated in her &quot;How I Came To Be MSFINANCIALSAVVY&quot; chapter at the beginning of the book, resonates throughout to demonstrate that personal change is possible one step at a time.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub; attitude, illustrated in her &quot;How I Came To Be MSFINANCIALSAVVY&quot; chapter at the beginning of the book, resonates throughout to demonstrate that personal change is possible one step at a time.  <br />Phyllis<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-05-20

I found the novel to be well written, original, and crafty; but at times I also felt lost and confused.  Perhaps the latter is intentional since the story is narrated by Anthony Jones, an obese schizophrenic, who lives with his equally schizophrenic relatives.  Anthony is rapidly deteriorating and although he seems relatively in control at the beginning of the novel, it is quite clear that he has lost all of his mental faculties at the end.<br />The book is divided into three sections.  In \\"The Whale\\" segment,  Lavelle opens with Anthony's younger sister, mother, and grandmother rescuing him from Cornell University.  He has not attended classes in a couple of years, is living in squalor, and has supported himself with menial jobs.  He returns home to live in the basement and reacquaint himself with the old neighborhood.  It is in this section that we learn about Anthony's atrocious eating habits, his mother's mental disorder, and his family's relationship with the neighbors.  He tries to reinsert himself into society by losing weight, dating, and getting a job.  Sadly, he is exploited by his employers and neighborhood thugs, fails at weight loss, and is jilted by his love interest.  In the \\"Miss Innocence\\" segment, a family road trip to the sister's beauty pageant goes awry, largely due to Anthony's worsening condition.  They meet a few questionable characters along the way that seem equally insane as the Jones clan. The last segment, \\"The Hounds\\" is Anthony's final descent into dementia where he becomes a danger to himself and others.  He is literally trapped physically in his neighborhood by the patrolling dogs and mentally in his weakened mind.<br />At most, The Ecstatic is entertaining.  As mentioned earlier, Lavalle lost me on a few twists and turns, but I continued reading to see how it would end.  I think the pacing of the story was solid, but character development was somewhat lacking.  Anthony's character was the most developed and that is putting it mildly; the other characters were lightly sketched and void of any real definition.  There were plenty of dark comedic episodes sprinkled throughout that caused me to laugh aloud, but more importantly, I felt pity for the central character as he surrendered to his illness.  I would not recommend this novel to everyone, only those who are curious and courageous enough to venture down a dark and disheartening literary side street.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Cluby's character was the most developed and that is putting it mildly; the other characters were lightly sketched and void of any real definition.

In A Prayer for Deliverance, Christopher Chambers resumes where the debut novel, Sympathy For the Devil, ended.  FBI agent, Angela Bivens, is back in action as an inspector called in to investigate the murders of prominent African American leaders.  While her superiors think the murders are the work of a well-known hate group, we find Angela dallying in the supernatural to solve the murders and bring the true assassins to justice.  Specifically, she is pulled into a dark underworld of Zulu \\"magick\\" to substantiate her theories and enlists the help of a rookie sidekick (and Wicca witch) to assist in the investigation.  As in the first novel, she is both supported and hindered by the FBI staff and must deal with the political powers of the agency and the bureaucracy of the Washington elite. To complicate things further, she stumbles through a newfound romance while struggling to overcome the emotional scars from her last boyfriend, a psychotic sociopath who was the evil perpetrator of her last case.<br />As one can imagine, this book is multi-dimensional and filled with numerous plot twists and turns.  There are so many characters with ulterior motives that this reviewer literally had to keep notes on who was who, their relationships to one another, and their relationships within the FBI hierarchy.<br /><br />This novel is extremely well written and very well researched as evidenced in the passages about South African culture and politics.  However, this reviewer felt that at times the plot tangents obscured the essence of the mystery.  In an attempt to make this a well-rounded novel, the author repeatedly lost this reviewer in the minutia and the surreal, dreamlike episodes that were scattered throughout the book.  Angela Bivens, earmarked as an FBI super sleuth, seemed bewildered and clueless at times which elongated the story and damaged her characterization as an ingenious, diehard super agent.  There were some segments in which she appeared to be as much of a victim as the targets.  Perhaps this was intentional, to show her vulnerabilities, however it came off as Angela being the luckiest detective alive instead of one of the sharpest.  Nonetheless, this reviewer persevered to see how the novel would conclude and was not disappointed.  Overall, this was a compelling mystery and proved to be entertaining.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Clubtim as the targets.

Playwright Suzan-Lori Parkss debut novel, Getting Mothers Body, has an affinity to William Faulkners classic, As I Lay Dying, only this time, Parks has flipped the script in a couple of areas.  First, instead of taking a body home to be buried, the characters are planning to exhume the remains of one high-strung, party girl/singer, Willa Mae Beede; and secondly, the characters are African American, the setting is 1963 rural Texas, and the lead character is Billy Beede, a poor pregnant, unwed, high school dropout.<br />After her mothers (Willa Mae) untimely demise, Billy returns to Lincoln by her mothers lesbian lover, Dill Smiles, to live with her maternal uncle, Roosevelt, and his wife, June, in their trailer behind a gas station.  Billy becomes pregnant by a married man and believes an abortion will solve all of her problems. To get the money for the procedure, she plans a journey back to Arizona to recover the small fortune (a pearl necklace and diamond ring) which according to Dill adorns Willa Maes corpse.  Billy is accompanied by an eccentric cast of characters, each with selfish desires for the treasure, each hoping it will fill a hole. These holes run deep ranging from pride, envy, debt to lust, unrequited love, childlessness, and spiritual loss.  Billy becomes an expert in recognizing holes, i.e. finding ones weaknesses, and uses her gift to manipulate her family and strangers to get what she wantsunknowingly becoming more like the con artist mother that she despises.<br />This novel, told in first person by each lead character, causes the reader to experience the journey from differing viewpoints.  Often times, the chapters represent character perspectives of the same event granting the reader the opportunity to hear multiple sides of the story. The author even interjects observations, blues songs, and ominous passages by the deceased Willa Mae.  The use of monologues allows the reader to learn firsthand each characters motivation, vulnerabilities, and haunted pasts; these elements contributed to the novels well developed characters. This reviewer also enjoyed the writing style and the extensive use of regional dialect to add realism to the dialogue.<br />Without a clue on how this story was going to end until the end, I was happy that the journey ultimately brought about some semblance of absolution and redemption for the motley crew, which was a welcomed relief for an otherwise dismal tale.  There is a lot more to this story than this review covers; one has to read to appreciate all the author has to offer.

Barbara Fleming's Hot Stones, Cold Death is a murder mystery featuring veteran Washington, DC Detective Matthew Alexander and his sidekick, Jake Jackson.  The mystery opens with two black men found dead dressed in African warrior regalia in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.  Their bodies are curiously arranged in an African Village diorama complete with spears, shields, and a priceless emerald necklace.  At first glance, it looks like a theft gone wrong, but something lies beneath the surface that does not sit well with Matt and Jake.  The detectives are faced with few clues, airtight alibis, and a hostile environment in which the highly connected museum staff wants the case closed as soon as possible.  They follow leads that take them all over DC; from posh Georgetown to the crackhouses of Florida Avenue.  A lucky break, another body, and  follow through on a haunting suspicion allow the detectives to apprehend the culprits and resolve the mystery.<br />There are many characters in this story and the author provides a great service to the reader by providing a list of primary characters and their roles at the beginning of the novel.  Even with the helpful guide, the author's handling of dialogue between characters is somewhat awkward and cumbersome at times, especially when familiar characters referred to each other by first and last names.  Despite the issues with dialogue, this reviewer found the plot to be original and very well paced.  The author introduces twists and turns at appropriate intervals to keep the reader interested until the end.  This is a light, easy read; appropriate for a summer afternoon.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club	2003-05-08

The introduction of Mojo:  Conjure Stories warns the reader to beware, to adorn their protective beads, to pocket their jujubags and sets the stage for the mystical anthology contained therein.  The novel, edited by Nalo Hopkinson, is comprised of nineteen short stories from noteworthy authors such as Steven Barnes, Tananarive Due, and Barbara Hambly.  All tales are colorful, creative, and rooted in \\"mojo\\" - a tricky, powerful, and dangerous magic with a West African flavor.<br />This is a diverse collection in that it traverses time to provide stories from the slave ships, the antebellum South, the Jim Crow era, the 1960's and even present day.  Some stories are rooted in folklore, e.g. Andy Duncan's \\"Daddy Mention and the Monday Skull\\",  while others address moral and societal issues such as incest, revenge, love, lust, and greed.  One of my favorites is Barbara Hambly's \\"The Horsemen and The Morning Star\\" in which plantation slaves garner strength and call upon their ancestor's gods to ride their weary backs to fight the master's resurrection of the devil to save one of their own.  Jarla Tangh's \\"The Skinned\\" references the recent Rowandan tragedy and delivers a powerful message against the backdrop of the modern American inner city.  Another noteworthy mention is Jenise Aminoff's \\"Fate\\" in which a mother with the gift of sight tries desperately to alter her son's destiny and pays a high price in the end.<br />This reviewer found some stories a bit more challenging to follow than others, but believes there is enough variety in subject matter and writing style to satisfy even the most critical reader. This book covered multiple dimensions of conjuring:  from using black magic to control spirits, outwitting the tricksters, initiating curses, belief in shape-shifting to the making and manipulation of zombies.  It was an engaging and interesting read about a mystical and magical heritage.  One can surely gain hours of reading pleasure with this book.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub>APOOO BookClub	2003-05-06

Crystal Wilkinson's Water Street is an engaging novel that<br />transports the reader to a middle-class neighborhood in small town Stanford, Kentucky, USA.  The residents are hardworking, law-abiding citizens who go to work, church, pay their taxes, and raise their families to the best of their abilities. In the opening passages of the book, the author mentions that every person has two stories to tell:  one story by day and the other by night which is kept near the heart for safekeeping. Wilkinson allows the reader to experience both stories through the carefully crafted monologues and short narratives.<br />The novel opens with the manic-depressant Yolanda in the midst of a meeting with her psychiatrist.  In her session, the reader is casually introduced to a few Water Street residents:  her best friend, Mona whom she idolizes; her brother, KiKi, her husband, Junior; and a host of other characters who influenced her in childhood and adulthood.  The beauty of the novel is the reader will learn more about Mona, Kiki, Junior, Sandy, Maxine, et al in subsequent chapters via a series of soliquies or third person accounts.  Through the selected medium, the reader observes how they tackle a host of issues such as interracial relationships, marital problems, quests for love, divorce, absentee parents, etc.<br />Because it is a small town and all the residents live on Water Street, the stories are interconnected and the same characters are often mentioned in one or more stories.  So for example, we hear about Mona, the best friend from Yolanda; Mona, my little sister's best friend that I slept with from Kiki; Mona in her own eyes, etc.  We get up close and personal viewpoints from mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, daughters, sons, neighbors and friends.  One particular noteworthy item is that the author's skill in writing from the male perspective is equally compelling as from the female's.  In &quot;The Girl of My Dreams: Kiki&quot;, we find Kevin/Kiki calling off the wedding after the rehearsal dinner, but not for the reasons one may think because of the title of the story.  We also experience other male viewpoints in the coming of age stories &quot;Water Street, 1979: Junior&quot;, &quot;Between Men&quot;, and a principled man in search of love in &quot;An Ordinary Man:  Reverend Townsend.&quot;<br />The dialogue is mature, the writing is great, and the stories are painfully honest.  These are not eccentric or malevolent characters, in fact, they are so down-to-earth that they seem real, almost like ordinary folk instead of fictional protagonists.  Just as with non-fictional beings, the harsh realities of life strikes Water Street as with any other street and the imperfections, vulnerabilities,pain, and joy of the characters are expertly revealed.  Water Street's messages are universal and timeless:  the same people with the same issues can be found in the inner cities as well as the rural landscapes in any decade.

Jeremy, nicknamed Patience by his paternal grandmother, Mama B, revisits his past by raising questions to puzzling childhood memories such as his parent's relationship, his untimely birth, his maternal grandparent's abandonment of him, and his relationship with distant father.  By the end of the story, we meet an eclectic cast of characters who answer all of Jeremy's questions and shed light for the reader to understand the meaning behind the novel's title.  To walk through mirrors is an expression of doing the impossible...it is to look at things from the other side of the mirror and see more than one's own reflection.<br />This is a complex story with multiple layers of family secrets and hidden agendas.  In this single visit home, Jeremy unknowingly has to reconcile his role as a son, stepson, grandson, brother, and nephew.  He must seek redemption from those he loves and who love him.  The writing style of Brian Keith Jackson is mature, fresh, and alluring-a definite notch above his contemporary peers.  I loved \\"The View From Here\\" and enjoyed \\"The Queen of Harlem\\".

The term, \\"Fire in a Canebrake\\", is a phrase that Walton County, Georgia residents used to describe the sounds of the fatal gunshots that commenced the last mass lynching in America; it is also the title of Laura Wexler's historical account of the Moore's Ford lynching where four blacks were murdered in late July 1946.  The novel painstakingly details the \\"who, what, when, where and why\\" of the horrific crime and is supported by interviews, FBI reports, and other detailed documentation.<br />Wexler takes us back to the beginning when a black man, Roger Malcolm, stabs a white man, Barnett Hester, for allegedly having an affair with his common law wife, Dorothy.  As Barnett lingers near death, Roger sits in jail counting his days left on earth.  Eleven days later when Barnett recovers, Roger is then set free when his bail is posted by Loy Harrison, a wealthy landowner and landlord to George Dorsey (Dorothy's older brother) and his common law wife, Mae Murray.  It is returning home from the jail that Roger, Dorothy, George, and Mae are dragged from Loy's car by an angry mob of white men and are murdered in cold blood.  Loy claims he did not and could not recognize any of the attackers which was why his life was spared on that fateful day....and so the lying begins and never seems to end.<br />For years, the NAACP, FBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), and local law enforcement conduct their investigations, interrogations, and examinations only to arrive at no convictions.  It is only in 1991, when an \\"eyewitness\\" steps forward to tell his story that there appears to be a slither of hope for justice.  However, hope fades as holes and contradictions run rampant in his testimony as well; and unfortunately by the early 1990's all of the suspected perpetrators and potential corroborating witnesses are deceased.  It appears that the leads had literally died out and one wonders if justice will ever be served.<br />The author does an excellent job of \\"peeling back the layers\\" to set the stage for the story and expertly blends in the national and state political agendas that influenced the course of events surrounding the lynching.  By doing so, the reader understands the history of the rural Georgian townships where the story plays out, the role of the key witnesses including their family and criminal backgrounds, public displays of bigotry and drunkenness. She also shares the political tactics of the day used to deny blacks of their Civil Rights and protection under Federal law, numerous contradictions in the witness's statements/alibis/affidavits, and lack of follow-up and missed opportunities by law officials.  The handling of the case by the investigators from beginning to end is totally unbelievable by today's standards, but what is moreso shocking is the blatant racism, hatred, and wantonness of the townsfolk toward an atrocity such as this.<br />This reader ran a myriad of emotions while reading the novel --  first, frustration in that no perpetrators were ever brought to justice and nor was anyone ever held accountable for these heinous crimes -- a fact that is unfortunately recurrent in so many lynching cases.  Secondly,  anger and sadness when reading about the intimidation and threats against local blacks as well as the breakdown and separation of the victim's families in the aftermath of the lynching.  The murders only exacerbated their wretched existence as poor, undereducated sharecroppers.  The author's skill in conveying their daily living conditions and lifestyle using census statistics and first hand accounts was outstanding and heartbreaking.<br />This book is a page-turner!  Although Oprah, Dateline, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution have covered this story, Wexler adds a twist:  her words breathe life into the pages and add color to the black and white photos in the book; she presents the evidence in such a way to allow readers to draw their own conclusions.  Hats off to Ms. Wexler for her perseverance and dedication to finding truth.  Well done!<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clube and dedication to finding truth.

In this single visit home, Jeremy unknowingly has to reconcile his role as a son, stepson, grandson, brother, and nephew.  He must seek redemption from those he loves and who love him.  The writing style of Brian Keith Jackson is mature, fresh, and alluring-a definite notch above his contemporary peers.  I loved \\"The View From Here\\" and enjoyed \\"The Queen of Harlem\\".  He has definitely earned a place on my favorite author list - a feat that is not easily managed.  I strongly recommend this novel and I am looking forward to his next body of work.<br />Phyllis<BR>APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2003-04-22

Christine Lincolns debut novel, Sap Rising, is rooted in the mystical, rural Grandville where the tales of its townspeople are captured in 12 intertwining short stories. The sagas are told from varying viewpoints: fathers, grandmothers, young boys, nosey neighbors, teenaged girls, etc. and are rooted in themes of self-discovery, escapism, and hope.<br />All of the stories are symbolic and appealing, but a few that really struck this reviewer were the title story, Sap Rising and A Very Close Conspiracy.  In Sap Rising, we meet a very restless young woman, Ebbie Pinder, who runs away from the mediocrity of life as a homemaker in Grandville to the bright lights of the big city.  She returns home alone and with her child, Pontella, in Like Dove Wings and Pontellas plight is recounted in A Hook Will Sometimes Keep You.  In A Very Close Conspiracy, we meet the town drunk, Hiron Fuller, who retraces his life, loves, and views as a black man as he succumbs to a fatal injury.<br />The author demonstrates her depth and range of character development by taking the reader deep inside the psyches of Hiron, a man worn down by racism and poverty, the self-doubting Pontella who was abandoned by her mother, Ebbie, and the painful episodes of Boags and Cinnys coming-of-age transformation.  She paints a picture of the human condition and adds insight and emotion into each story.  Ms. Lincoln is a great storyteller with a style akin to J. California Coopers yet distinctively her own.  She has made her mark with a successful debut  I am looking forward to her next release.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2003-04-17

As the full title suggests, Ejovi Nuwere's Hacker Cracker:  A Journey from the Mean Streets of Brooklyn to the Frontiers of Cyberspace is a coming of age story of a boy as he physically, emotionally and intellectually matures.  He witnesses his mother slowly succumb to AIDS related complications, battles with the inner city street gangs, deals with family drama, and yields to unrelenting peer pressure.  At one point in his young life, he attempts suicide and spends time in a mental ward.  He shares his childhood life stories and admits how his first introduction to hacking was that on the side of wrongdoing (soliciting credit card numbers from unsuspecting online users).  Through a twist of fate, he applies his skills toward good and goes legit in the field of computer security.<br />This story is an autobiography, however because the author is so young, the book spends a great deal of time discussing his days as an outcast in high school and his adventures in the different hacking groups and online communities. Although his computing exploits may be interesting to the \\"techies\\" of the world, I fear that lay people will struggle to retain interest during those sections of the book.  More importantly, I think this novel is a testament to a man who could have easily fallen victim to his circumstances.  He was/is largely self-taught and chose to use his intellect and street smarts to capitalize on his programming skills.  This book is an inspirational read for young people as it demonstrates that alternatives and opportunities exist everywhere---one just has to be open and willing to consider the possibilities.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club	2003-04-07

From the time that Ursa Corregidora is able to listen, she is told by her great-grandmother that she must retain \\"the evidence\\" in order to pass it on to her children.  Initially, one would think this is a harmless request.  However, \\"the evidence\\" is an oral history of how her great-grandmother was raped and then used as a whore by her white slave owner, Corregidora, as was her daughter (Ursa's grandmother) after her.  Corregidora then impregnates Ursa's grandmother (his biological daughter) to produce Ursa's mother.  Not only is this a disturbing history for a child to commit to memory, but her great-grandmother's resentment and distrust of men were also passed onto a young Ursa.<br />Although Ursa had a black father, she resembles the Portuguese Corregidora.  Her light skin and fine hair causes her to be ostracized by black women and desired by black men.  She expresses her lifelong frustrations in the form of song and has moderate success as a blues singer in the small local club circuit.  Ursa finds herself suffering emotionally, verbally, and physically at the whim of her husband, Mutt, who begins to exhibit the same jealousy, possessiveness, and envy that her great-grandmother shared regarding her relationship with Corregidora.<br />Through flashbacks and internal memories, we understand Ursa's mental anguish when trying to discern between the painful slave legacy and her present day household situation.  True to the mindset of the time, a woman's childbearing ability is looked upon as her only source of power and we see Ursa's torment further exacerbated when her ability to pass \\"the evidence\\" to her children is jeopardized.<br />This book addresses racism, slavery, and sexism on several different levels.  Be warned-- it grips the reader from the beginning and goes deep in a very \\"Alice Walker-ish\\" kind of way.  I experienced difficulty following the dialogue at times but I hung in there and relied on inference to follow the author's insinuations; and despite this one `snag', I was not disappointed with Ms. Jones's first novel.

Too often women of color hide behind walls of silence (with disastrous consequences), only turning to therapy when the burdens become too heavy to bear.  I loved the way the author substantiated this point by citing the historical \\"silent suffering\\" experienced by African American slaves as fodder for pain; how religion is repeatedly viewed as the only means of relief; and how the \\"silent suffering\\" is still deeply rooted in the modern African American psyche.<br /><br />The middle portion of the book contains eight success stories of black women who have benefited from therapy.  Each woman has different types of issues ranging from emotional and sexual abuse, relationship issues, and self-respect/identity problems.  Dr. Singleton introduces each story with care and compassion.  Her objectivity, presentation of the issues, and counsel to her patients are helpful, sound, and sensible.  She has simplified highly complex problems which allow the reader to easily empathize and learn from the lessons of others.  My only comment here is she might have over-simplified a bit too much, but her advice and strategies to minimize stress and encourage her clients are wonderful.<br />I think this book is an excellent resource for women, especially black women, who need to know that they are not alone in their experiences with abuse, failed relationships, and/or career disappointments.  It also provides clear explanations and warning signs along with practical suggestions and exercises for healthier living.  It demonstrates that personal change is possible and helps women realize that if they choose to overcome the cultural stigma of therapy, they will find the support, comfort, relief, and balance needed to let the healing begin.<br />Reviewed by Phyllisin.  <br />Reviewed by Phyllis<BR>	2003-04-04

Sebastian, a self-made man, pulled himself up from his proverbial \\"bootstraps\\" and escaped from Newark, NJ's inner city to the posh surroundings of the suburban Charlotte, NC.  To complete the \\"look\\" he has the flashy, canary colored (not yellow) sports car and a beautiful, snooty coed girlfriend, 13 years his junior.<br />Sebastian is in his late-30's and undergoes somewhat of a \\"mid-life\\" crisis in which he chooses to lay down his trophies (including the young girlfriend) and add substance and purpose to his life.  He decides to expand his business by returning to Newark and increase his public service activities by volunteering in his childhood neighborhood.  With the help of a geriatric cupid, Mr. Duke, Sebastian connects with his long lost love, Josephine Flowers.  She is everything he remembers and more - in fact, she is married.  Sebastian learns that she married very hastily on the rebound from their bitter, heart shattering break-up seven years earlier, however he does not know that she has been silently suffering ever since.  The drama ensues as Sebastian tries to win her back.....but will he be successful in his pursuit of love and happiness?  Can Josephine forgive him for the painful act that he forced upon her....the one act she has regretted daily for seven years?  Read to find the answer!<br />Major has written a perfect novel for a lazy summer afternoon-it has romance/drama, it is fresh, and it is light.  The book exhibits solid pacing, decent writing, and great characterization.  Major further demonstrated his skills by delivering au courant and clever dialogue, especially between the female characters Josephine and her best friend, Gloria.

She has been reading signs all her life and she has never been wrong.  So when the pen's ink runs dry while attempting to write the name of her granddaughter's fianc&eacute; in the family bible, she knows something is wrong...and the drama begins.  Yolanda Joe's The Hatwearer's Lesson focuses on the relationships of and between a countrified, sassy, hat-wearing grandmother (Grandma Ollie) and her ambitious, citified, attorney granddaughter, Terri Mills.<br />Terri and her fianc&eacute;, Derek, are a hard working, high profile, no nonsense attorney power couple.  Their relationship is what fairytales are made of: they look good together, have great careers, and have the political and social connections to match.  But Grandma Ollie's prediction comes true and trouble invades paradise on both the romantic and professional fronts.  Terri soon finds herself back in the small rural town of Collingswood, Arkansas under the counsel of Grandma Ollie.  In a strange turn of events (fate perhaps), Terri's life is rearranged with a surprise ending.  However, it is not only the Terri-Derek storyline that baits the reader; it is the amorous adventures of a young Grandma Ollie that are equally engaging.  It is there where the valuable life lessons are truly revealed and where Terri extracts the wisdom and guidance to make the right decisions regarding Derek and her life.<br />The Hatwearer's Lesson is a charming novel full of homespun anecdotes, humor, and wit. Some of the expressions quoted by Grandma Ollie are truly \\"keepers\\" and can be retained as priceless bits of practical advice.

At a very high level Jenoyne Adams's latest novel can be described as a moving story of Selah and her struggle with love, acceptance, and forgiveness; however there are so many more facets and dimensions to Selah's Bed that this review cannot express because doing so would spoil the reading experience.<br />In the novel, Selah is an artist who photographs nude men and is always looking for the \\"perfect shot\\" that will convey the true essence of her subjects.  On the same vibe, Adams wields her pen to convey the essence of Selah's troubled spirit.  As a child, Selah is abandoned by her teenaged, prostitute mother which causes a lingering ache to emerge in her heart.  As an adult, Selah loses a child and the ache becomes more intense, entrenching itself so deeply that Selah begins to withdraw into dark, private places to find solace with destructive results.<br />Selah is a complex character and the author is very effective in layering the stress, pain, and regrets on Selah against a familiar backdrop.  She is reared in the projects by her pill-popping grandmother (Mama Gene) and alcoholic grandfather.  She never knew her father.  It has been said that imitation is the highest form of flattery and we soon see a young Selah desperately trying to connect with her absentee mother by emulating her whorish ways.  We see her wrestle with her relationship (or lack thereof) with God, her husband, and eventually her lover only to find some semblance of peace by writing letters to her long lost daughter, Michelle.  Throughout the novel, we see her slowly embrace a bohemian lifestyle and rescind into deep internal places eventually distancing herself from everyone who is dear to her.  We see her crumble when her \\"other mother,\\" Mama Gene, falls victim to mental abandonment via Alzheimer's disease leaving Selah again motherless twice in a lifetime.  Through a series of events, Selah's emotional well overflows and it is then when her epiphany occurs.<br />Adam's style of writing is lyrical, sharp, and refreshing.  The plot is a revitalizing departure from the popular \\"contemporary dramas\\" of late.  The characters are full-bodied and marvelously broken.  She expertly conveys the psychological and emotional aspects of a deprived child who evolves into a heavily burdened woman.  Selah is a complicated, passionate character and the author skillfully reveals the fragility of Selah's damaged psyche from past transgressions.  She masterfully unfolds the driving forces that spawn Selah's decadent behavior by showing us her world from childhood to adulthood.  Although a work of fiction, I loved the manner in which the author cleverly exposes a number of social issues and universal themes throughout the novel.  One example is the maternal bonding/love/protection theme; it is an underlying driving force for Selah because she yearns to receive it as a child and desires to provide it as an adult to her long lost child.<br />This is my first reading of this author's work and I was wonderfully surprised and entertained by the experience.  However, I would not recommend this book to everyone; only those who would enjoy and appreciate a departure from the norm.  I plan to pull Resurrecting Mingus from my overcrowded bookshelf and place it on my nightstand--and I will definitely pick up her next release.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club<br />March 29, 2003ting is lyrical, sharp, and refreshing.

Books	3	2	2	N	N	Be Careful for What You Wish	Simon Says, Collen Dixon's debut novel, takes place in the Chocolate City (Washington, DC) where she exposes us to the worst and best sides of what the city has to offer.  She begins in the ghetto, in the rough, hard streets of the Shaw neighborhood.  We meet Alex \\"Chip\\" Baxter, a young, shy, bookwormish boy who lives in the shadow of his popular, good-looking basketball star brother, Ivan. The Baxter boys are motherless.  Their tough, no nonsense father constantly dotes on Ivan and ignores Chip, largely because he physically resembles his mother which is a constant, painful reminder to his father.<br />When teenaged Ivan meets a premature death, Chip isolates himself further from society and totally submerges himself into his studies.  He is determined to make it out of Shaw to \\"become somebody\\"; and ultimately decides that education will be his ticket out of the ghetto.  Alex excels academically and earns a scholarship to Hilliard University.  One eerie night while walking home from the library, a strange twist of fate occurs and sets in motion a series of life altering events.  Alex is literally transformed overnight from a nerdy nobody to the Big Man on Campus complete with membership into the PsiKO fraternity and the DC mayor's daughter, Tiffany, as his girlfriend and future wife.  The DC mayor, Simon Blake, weaves a calculating Svengali-type relationship with Alex and after graduation is deemed \\"Prince of the City\\" complete with a mini-mansion in the posh Northeast area of the city.  The fairy tale lifestyle comes crashing down when the proverbial skeletons get restless and emerge from the closet.  Alex's curiosity initiates a roller coaster ride that leads to the discovery of the truth about Simon, Tiffany, Ivan's mysterious death, and himself.  He vows retribution and justice for wronged deeds of the past, but can this former milquetoast and puppet match wits with DC's most powerful, ruthless man to execute revenge and remain alive?<br />Ms. Dixon delivers a solid debut novel.  Although this reader found the pacing to be a bit drawn out at times, discovered a few repetitive passages, and thought the storyline was somewhat predictable; I believe the character development, imagery, and handling of dialogue was strong for both Alex and Tiffany.

After meeting with the handsome, debonair attorney and executor of the will, Arthur Blevins, she unexpectedly discovers the family home is left to her instead of its current occupant, Aunt Gladys.  This single act causes Aunt Gladys quite a bit of consternation as she is fearful that Cheryl will sell the house and leave her homeless.  Cheryl quickly dismisses this fear and the two women quickly realize that they share similar experiences - sightings of Celia, Gladys's late sister.  Celia's apparition, which begins appearing more frequently at inopportune times in heightening states of anguish, sparks Cheryl's interest into Celia's accidental death nearly 30 years before.<br />Cheryl's investigation takes her to the esteemed Graham estate to confront a man who belongs to a very powerful and conniving family who has members in the North Carolina Senate and Supreme Court.  She eventually learns that their families share a sordid, painful, tangled history that many would rather keep buried at all cost.  After several close encounters with death, Cheryl, with help from both aunts and Arthur, brings the long-buried truth to the surface and reveals forbidden romances, deep family secrets, racially inspired misgivings, hidden pregnancies, and murders by some unlikely, unexpected culprits.  Cullars also sprinkles in a fateful romance between Cheryl and Arthur.<br />Despite a somewhat slow start, the book quickened its pace and turned into an attention-grabber!

Washington's work is rooted in 20th century ideologies and social issues such as racism, interracial relationships, and genocide.  His lead characters are often of African American descent set in futuristic settings facing extraordinary dilemmas.  Also equally entertaining is the infusion of modern day references to present day icons such as Jesse Jackson XII speaking at Colin Powell High School for commencement exercises and characters viewing films by Spike Lee XIV.<br />Two of the stories that were most interesting to this reviewer were entitled Oreo and Bad Medicine.  Oreo dealt with an ancient voodoo curse that bonded a white slave owning mistress to her black slave lover.  The antidote to break the curse is a very simple act of forgiveness, but has proven to be impossible to obtain for the past three centuries.  Even by modern standards, the cure would be a challenge for any woman; it is indeed a tall order.<br />The second story, Bad Medicine, involves an African American doctor who is delivering medical supplies to a remote Aryan separatist colony that left Earth to isolate themselves from non-white people.  Their racist beliefs have stewed for eons to the point they developed an intergalactic treaty to ensure they have no part of any technology, medicine, vaccines, music, food, supplies developed or originated by non-whites.  They also refuse interaction with non-white persons on any level, i.e. delivery of supplies to their home world.  When he arrives, he learns that a plague has stricken the Aryan colony and their race is faced with obliteration.  The doctor is torn between honoring the Hippocratic Oath and saving the Aryans or letting them perish.  The plague's cure requires injecting the Aryans with a vaccine made from live tissue from non-whites which is in direct violation of the treaty.  He could also choose to keep galactic peace by letting them die by following their self-imposed belief system.<br />Other stories involve vampirism, sex robots, telekinesis, mental telepathy, intelligence boosters, and other surreal topics.  Overall, Cecil Washington's Alien Erotica is an entertaining read; it is an easy and quick departure from the 'drama-filled' novels of modern day.  The title is a little misleading because although there is intimacy among the characters (all are not alien) and adult language is used; it is not an overly sexually explicit novel by today's standards.  Obviously this book is not for everyone, but if you are open to some creative writing and exploring the sci-fi/fantasy genre you might want to give this book a try.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Clubpeace by letting them die by following their self-imposed belief system. <br />Other stories involve vampirism, sex robots, telekinesis, mental telepathy, intelligence boosters, and other surreal topics.

The author transcends two centuries to reveal the foundation of a family: an African captive called Sapphire because of her beautiful blue-black skin tone.  Her physical statue and dauntless attitude commands a semblance of respect from everyone, including her enslavers.  Sapphire remains strong, defiant, and unbroken despite the horrors of the Middle Passage, systematic rape, physical beatings, and back-breaking slave labor. So daring is she that immediately following a brutal act of sexual abuse at the hands of her owner who promises to do the same to her infant daughter when she is of age, Sapphire kills her daughter rather than allow the child to suffer the same fate she herself has endured.<br />At death, Sapphire is hastily buried in a shallow grave, but her tormented soul cannot rest.  In spirit form, she approaches each of her female descendents and evokes memories and visions for them to discover, awaken, and use their inherent inner strength to love themselves, gain self-respect, and obtain inner peace to survive in a cruel and difficult world.  For the next two hundred years, Sapphire touches the bewitched Sister, the prostitute Vyda Rose, the lovelorn Jewel, the artistic Clovey, and truth-telling, outspoken, shameless Rae'ven who embodies Sapphire's spirit completely and thus allows Sapphire to return to the grave satisfied and fulfilled.<br />The author writes in a thoughtful, lyrical prose which educes a myriad of emotions and reader empathy for the characters.  Gurley-Highgate offers the reader an introspective look inside the lives and minds of the lead characters and their lovers.  She clearly illustrates how Sapphire's spirit changes, fortifies, and empowers her daughters regardless of their station in life.  There is a valuable lesson in this book for all women regardless of race and/or socio-economic class.<br />So touching and well written that this book has earned a place on my best reads list.

Chuck Harris is an upwardly mobile, smooth-talking black man hand-picked by Charlotte's richest banking mogul to play the part of a political pawn and puppet whenever convenient.  Chuck is quite comfortable in the role and relishes the perks and special treatments-including frequent trips to the bank-owned strip club.  He is so misguided, arrogant, and lost that he decides to leave his longtime wife and children to capture what he feels is the ultimate trophy:  a young, white, sensual wife.  He soon realizes how quickly The New South can revert back to The Old South and finds his choice of bride is heavily scrutinized by both blacks and whites in this extremely conservative community.  Chuck is further alienated when the new wife is brutally murdered and he, as the prime suspect, finds himself behind bars with few friends facing the gas chamber.<br />Enter Michael Johnson, a young investigative reporter who has just arrived from Washington, DC.  In a bizarre series of events, Michael obtains evidence that could ultimately free Chuck, however the forces of The Old South are working against him.  This fuels Michael's search for the truth and he literally becomes a super-sleuth overnight.  However Chuck is such an ungrateful, hateful person that Michael repeatedly questions his own involvement in Chuck's defense.  Rest assured, Michael is an idealist and can not rest until justice is served.<br />This is my first time reading Gregory Morris's work and I found this book to be a light, entertaining who-dun-it.

She takes us back to the beginning - rewinding time and starting with the very young Campbell and Donovan and slowly moving them into adulthood.<br />Through carefully placed flashbacks, we transcend generations and meet Campbell and Donovan's grandparents and parents in their younger state of being.  We experience their pain, joy, shame, and fears.  We learn their most scandalous and guarded secrets and begin to understand all the complexities and dynamics that shape their thoughts and actions. We clearly see the cycle of desolation that ultimately molds and influences Campbell and Donovan.  The families are dysfunctional, the homes are broken, no one is perfect, but they are doing the best they can given the circumstances.  McFadden gives us just enough to understand Campbell's quest for love and to empathize with the troubled, delicate psyche of Donovan.  Will Donovan and Campbell overcome the personal baggage to embrace love?  Can they supercede their haunting, painful pasts for a promising future together?  Read to find the answers.<br />It is the beauty of McFadden's words, pacing, and storytelling style that keeps the reader mesmerized throughout the book.  This reviewer finished the book in one sitting.  Her writing style is simplistic, precise, and rhythmic which makes it so easy to visualize images, hear the voices, and feel the emotions.  Loving Donovan will not disappoint McFadden fans...I loved it and cannot wait to see what she presents next.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO Bookclub, Nubian Circle Book Club	2003-02-12

This dark debut novel by Mirika Cornelius is set in rural Kentucky and centers on a young girl's search for her parents.  Secret Jones is a lonely, angry, and misunderstood child left at birth in the care of her loving maternal great-aunt. She initially has little contact or knowledge of any other relatives with the exception of an occasional visit from her mother's brother. Secret's young life is turned upside down when the great aunt passes away unexpectedly. Her hardship (physical, mental, and verbal abuse) begins when she is forced to stay with an alcoholic, promiscuous paternal aunt. For years, the aunt tells Secret that her mother was a whore and questions Secret's paternity. This abusive atmosphere and years of societal ostracism compel a teenaged Secret to begin her quest to find the truth. The journey leads to even more eccentric relatives, a heartbreaking, awkward confrontation of the town's pillars (including the local minister), the meeting of her first love, and discovery of her inner strength, self-respect, and dignity. When the truth is finally revealed, it is shocking and painful.<br />Be warned, this book is not for everyone - it is a somewhat depressing tale with episodes of rape, domestic violence, and graphic child abuse. However, it is a relatively short book that can be read in one sitting. It starts slowly, but quickly becomes a \\"page-turner;\\" my heart truly felt for the child who was in desperate need of love and protection. The author's storytelling ability is good - she is very straightforward and honest. However, I had issues with the timeframe in which this story was to have occurred. For example, at the beginning of the novel, I thought (based on setting descriptions) the era was somewhere in the 1920-1940's. When the author described Secret's school and children on the playground double-dutching, I thought perhaps the 1970-1980's, yet when she described the model of the cars and use of the \\"boyfriend's\\" vernacular/dialog it made me think it was modern day, perhaps in the late 1990's or the new millennium. So I was constantly adjusting my frame of mind and mental images throughout the story. Aside from that, Ms. Cornelius shows great potential - this reviewer is looking forward to her next body of work.k it was modern day, perhaps in the late 1990's or the new millennium.

Told in alternating chapters, the book recounts the contributions of their family, friends and supporters in an autobiographical format.  Patricia Due carefully shares her personal family history as foundation for her motivation and attraction toward the principles of racial equality.  She drew courage and strength from the examples her parents provided in daily life.  She covers the fear, anxiety, blood, sweat, and tears that resulted from numerous sit-in's, freedom rides, marches, and rallies in such detail that I felt I had witnessed them myself.  She shares her pain and dedication in heartfelt passages such as the loss of a baby during a voter registration project.  Tananarive's viewpoint is that of a daughter living in the post-Civil Rights era.  Her story recaps the difficulty of growing up in largely white neighborhoods and schools and of being ostracized by both blacks for being \\"too white\\" and whites for being \\"too black\\".  The details of her struggle and childhood observations of her parent's lives are equally compelling as her mother's.<br />This novel is a wonderful history lesson that includes details that uncover the fortitude and determination of many unsung heroes.  The personal sacrifices (suspension/expulsion from college, permanent physical injury, and death) of \\"everyday people\\" for the sake of justice are truly admirable and honorable.<br />For this reviewer, this book was particularly touching because Patricia goes into great detail about the forming of CORE and other noteworthy events happening at FAMU during the same era when my parents, aunts, and uncles attended.  She also mentions events in other small towns in Florida where other members of my family lived, so key passages sparked a lot of memories --resulting in me getting a very personal slant on my family's viewpoints on the struggle while reading this book.  This body of work is truly a labor of love and a great accomplishment for the Due family; one can only imagine the countless hours it took to pull it all together.  It is an excellent memoir, a beautiful legacy, and a definite keepsake for me!<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Clubthe struggle while reading this book.

Beamon's sophomore novel, Eyewitness, undertakes the difficult issues surrounding racial prejudice, personal culpability, and redemption.  In her novel, a small, secluded Southern town has reluctantly embraced the concept of integration with the construction of the historically African American Beulah Baptist Church in a traditionally Caucasian neighborhood.  However, early one summer morning the peacefulness of Emerson Woods is awakened to the smell of smoke, fire, and gunshots to find a church engulfed in flames and a local White resident murdered on its front lawn.<br />The police question two eyewitnesses that yield differing descriptions of the perpetrator:  an upright White citizen describes a White man leaving the scene and an elderly, visually impaired Black citizen describes a Black man fleeing the area.  Unfortunately, the personal issues of the investigating officers lead them to arrest and brutalize an innocent black man.  The story continues and we eventually learn that police officers, lawyers, sheriff, and the eyewitnesses themselves have varying degrees of pernicious baggage that clouds their \\"vision\\" and the ability to \\"see\\" the truth.  Their impartiality and judgment is blurred by their personal ills.  However, each eventually realizes that to solve the murder and to identify the arsonist they must face their problems and work together (instead of against each other), before the truth can be \\"seen\\".<br />Besides a few loose ends surrounding a few of the main character's personal issues, the book moved at a solid pace and was very well written.  Beamon's writing style is precise and succinct; the novel is easy to read and the message is clear.  The reader walks away with valuable lessons on faith, healing, and transcendental justice.

The Dawn of Man is an interesting Sci-Fi novel by Elbert Lewis that combines modern day racial and social issues with those of a futuristic intergalactic threat.  The novel opens with Olsen, an FBI field agent, assigned to investigate a brutal rape/murder of a young, African American girl in the Deep South.  A White supremacy group is suspected in the murder and is eventually traced to a complicated assassination plot at the higher levels of the national government.  During the course of questioning, Olsen discovers that his Viet Nam mentor, Logan, is alive and has publicly declared revenge on those who committed such a heinous crime.  Logan, who appears to have not aged in 30 years, shares with Olsen an incredible tale of man's origins on Earth that goes against the established Christian creation beliefs.  Logan reveals that man was created from an alien experiment called the Genetic Optimized Development (GOD) project in which the genetic composition of the Neanderthal (caveman) was altered to create the Mutation Accelerated Nemesis (MAN).  MAN is made to become an ultimate fighting machine for The Reiign, a passive alien race.  He also warns Olsen of an imminent alien invasion of The Reiign's enemies, The Hadarans (a feline-like race reminiscent of King's Sleepwalker characters), which is met with much doubt and cynicism by Olsen's superiors and America's leaders until what Logan predicted begins to come true.<br />The story progresses to include familiar themes of the poly-ethnic man as a supreme being, an implication of a second American Civil War, and the global uniting of humankind to overcome a common enemy. Lewis's Logan character is a refreshing and likeable hero; he is focused, smart, African American, and has a strong sense of justice.  Lewis develops the remaining central characters fairly well while others are rather one-dimensional being introduced and dismissed rather quickly within the many subplots intertwined in the novel.  Even with Lewis's assistance, this reader found it somewhat confusing to keep up with the number of acronyms used in describing the military/government agencies, military terms, and the contrived devices and utilities of Logan's alien technology.  Besides a few editorial glitches, the novel is very suspenseful and moves well, at some points proved to be a great page-turner.  This reader was a little disappointed in the ending (there were some loose ends), but understood it and is looking forward to the sequel.<br />Overall, Lewis does a good job at laying the foundation for a plausible, alternate universe that includes The Reiign, The Hadarans, a new order on Earth, and MAN's role in all of it.  This book is recommended for true science fiction lovers.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Clubtance, this reader found it somewhat confusing to keep up with the number of acronyms used in describing the military/government agencies, military terms, and the contrived devices and utilities of Logan's alien technology.

Fifth Born is the heart-wrenching debut saga of Odessa Blackburn, the fifth born child to verbally and physically abusive parents, in the tenements of St. Louis, MO.  From as far back as she can remember, she has treaded lightly and second-guessed her moves to be the good, obedient child who seeks the love and approval of her parents.  However, chaos and neglect reign supreme in the Blackburn household.  Her father, an alcoholic and incestuous pedophile, nearly blinds Odessa in one eye during a drunken stupor and ultimately molests Odessa and other female members of the household whenever her mother is absent.  Sadly, her mother discovers the incident and does nothing.<br />Throughout Odessa's young life, she sporadically gets encouragement from a teacher, an older sister, an uncle, and the belief in her deceased grandmother's unconditional love for her.  She learns hard lessons but eventually becomes more self-reliant, self-assured, and starts to exhibit some traits of self-love.  The salvation to her dark and painful existence comes from an unlikely source in an unexpected ending.  She discovers that her search for truth was not in vain and it is a liberating reward for her lifelong quest.  Lockhart's writing style reminds me of Alice Walker's - it is intense and pointed, but this new author has a unique voice all her own.

In her latest novel, Douglass' Women, Jewel Parker Rhodes travels back in history to the antebellum and Civil War era to examine the loves of Frederick Douglass.  She stretches the imagination by exploring the psyche of Anna, a free woman of color, who loves Douglass almost to a fault and Ottilie Assing, a European, free-spirit who is attracted to the polished and principled Douglass.<br />The novel, told in chronological alternating chapter format, provides the reader a glimpse into the character and upbringing of each woman.  Anna is a quiet, hardworking homemaker, devoted wife and mother who clings to the belief that love conquers all.  She has a strong sense of family and has witnessed unconditional love between her parents and siblings.  Her one wish is to have the same love returned to her from Douglass.  Unfortunately, Douglass, a self-taught ex-slave, has been elevated to a level of celebrity and lifestyle that pushes Anna to the background where she reluctantly finds comfort.  While her husband is recognized as a skilled orator and accomplished author, Anna is regarded as a recluse and intentionally remains illiterate (despite Douglass' urging otherwise) which creates an erudite chasm between them that widens as the years progress.  Ottilie Assing, a genteel woman of German-Jewish ancestry, works as Douglass' interpreter.  She fills the intellectual void and accompanies Douglass on many engagements.  They grow fond of each other and a lifetime love affair begins.<br />Rhodes writes very vividly so the reader clearly understands the similarities, differences, jealousy, envy, and anger each woman feels toward each other and Douglass.  Rhodes also parallels the societal prejudices of Jews in Europe to Africans in America which justifies Ottilie's attraction to Abolitionist views. She also subtly touches the issues surrounding interracial relationships through her character's dialogue and thoughts.  Although this is a work of historical fiction, she carefully follows the actual timeframe of events to effortlessly blend in factual people, places, and excerpts from speeches, which lends credibility to the novel.  From a literary standpoint, her use of the \\"water-death-freedom\\" symbolism was handled expertly and was used as the unifying thread for both women's tales.

Church Folk takes the reader to the Deep South, Mississippi 1963, where the young Reverend Theophilus Simmons has just landed his first appointment as pastor of Greater Hope Church. Although haunted by a past indiscretion with a fellow parishioner, Theophilus is determined to walk a straight and narrow path.  He breaks an unwritten convention by courting and marrying the down-to-earth, rib-joint cook, Essie Lee.  The remainder of the novel deals with their journey as first couple in the local troubled church, regional church politics, and the maturation of their relationship as a Christian couple.<br />Although this is a work of fiction, Bowen has crafted a plot which exposes issues that have historically plagued the clergy and are still prevalent in today's headlines: greed, sexual misconduct, and secular politics among other indiscretions.  Because of this, the author has chosen to include a number of sexual situations and references between characters that may disinterest some real \\"church folk\\" reader.  She justifies her choice for doing so within the novel through the voice of the central character, but this reader found that it could be viewed as inappropriate for some younger readers.<br />The book is an enjoyable story (albeit a little slow at times) that is sprinkled with Christian morals.  The cast is diverse, colorful, funny, and full of life.  I am sure that some readers may notice some of the same characteristics in their fellow churchgoers.  The take-away is, this is a very easy read that almost anyone can enjoy.<br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club	2002-11-10

What if America had been colonialized by people of African descent?  What if the Mayan Empire would have flourished?  What if Europeans were enslaved by the Africans? What if Islam was the dominant religion of the world&#146;s superpowers?  All of these possibilities are realities in Steven Barnes&#146; epic classic, Lion&#146;s Blood.  The author took a lot of time to build this alternate reality in which African Americans of Muslim decent rule America and the enemy are the Aztecs.  This artificial world which houses the growing nation of Bilalistan is all too familiar while at the same time stunningly different from our own recent past. It is a place of lyrical beauty and heartbreaking pain.<br />The story opens in Ireland with a young Aidan O'Dere, a child close to his clan being pulled from his village in an orchestrated slave raid.  He witnesses his father's murder and undergoes (along with his mother and younger sister) a horrendous &#147;middle passage&#148; crossing onto the auction blocks on the shores of Bilanistan.  The sister is separated from them and sold off as a maidservant while Aiden and his mother are sold to a plantation-like estate deep inside the new country.  He quickly realizes his dreams of returning home are just that&#151;dreams, but he vows to return home one day with his family in tact.  We can only imagine the terror being in a place where the trees, traditions, religion, sky, earth, people, clothing, language, smell, food, architecture are all different and new.  The story centers around the relationship Aidan has with the &#147;master&#146;s&#148; son, Kai, as they grow into manhood.  A long and very unlikely friendship begins as a result of some uncanny events. Even though Aidan is viewed by Kai as a servant, along the way their relationship develops into much more. Will Aidan find his sister?  Will he escape and return to Ireland?  Read to find the answer.<br />Steven Barnes has a wonderful gift for establishing sympathy for the European slave and empathy for the African enslavers/masters.  The reader is drawn to his well-developed characters and well-described universe.  I loved the poetry and the manner in which Barnes kept traditions rooted in our known reality (Celtics and their tree worship, Aztecs in human sacrifice, etc). I'd say that you'd definitely have to be in a \\"mood\\" for this rather long book. There are a lot of characters and the Islamic names are very long and at first it was hard keeping track of who was whom--especially when he was laying out the family tree and the roles, traditions, and responsibilities by birth order, etc.  But I quickly became familiar with everyone's role and found it to be an enjoyable read nonetheless.  The \\"what if\\" scenarios do not require much imagination because Barnes does an excellent job filling in the blanks and allowing us to glimpse into a different world.  The author also laces the novel with really deep issues such as karmic justice and the age/old issues of honor, love, respect, and the universal struggle of doing the right thing even at the risk of personal suffering or loss.  The reader will love, hate, admire, and cry throughout this moving novel.

The Thief of Letters is yet another tale of the tragic mulatto-however, this time Johnson's vivid imagination and outstanding writing skills breathes new life into a tired story line.  This is the story of Brandy/Helen who was sold away from her mother at a young age.  (I pause here to relay that the imagery painted by Johnson for this scene in the novel was powerful and heartbreaking-the mother's pain and humiliation crept from the pages into the reader's mind).  The reader follows Helen into adulthood as she evolves from being the master's daughter's helpmate to the mistress of the master's son.<br />True to the \\"tragic mulatto\\" formula, Helen is largely ostracized by the majority of the slaves because of her light skin and initial station as a \\"house\\" Negro.  Her association to the local slave/witch who practices voodoo causes nearly all the slaves to fear her.  Her torment is exacerbated when the master notices her strength and stamina during play and places her in the field with the very Negroes who despise and fear her.<br />Her solace comes in the form of stealing letters (one at a time) from the master's children's spelling books to learn the alphabet.  She eventually teaches herself to read.  This ability will save her life (and others) repeatedly throughout her adventures in pursuit of freedom.  There is so much more to this book that this review does not cover because of space and time constraints.  Simply said:  The author is a great storyteller and the book is superbly written.  There are so many underlying issues and topics of discussion that were intertwined in the novel that one simply has to read it for themselves to appreciate this body of work.

Much to their surprise they find some very lonely, neglected, and abused souls in their midst and quickly learn that despite their best intentions the outcome is not always what is expected.<br />Told largely in Louella's point of view, the reader will enjoy her sense of humor, her witty retorts, and her self-proclaimed \\"country\\" ways.  The book has a wonderful cast of supporting characters that symbolically represent the good, the bad, the lost, and confused.

The novel takes place in the posh Silver Lake community of Prince George's County, Maryland where we enter a world filled with a host of characters representing the various socio-economic classes.  We meet the black elite represented by Bradford Bentley, a self-made, philandering millionaire and his wife, Barbara, a woman who hides her pain in the bottle.  There is a  \\"BUPPIE\\" couple represented by Patrick and his wife, Jolene who has an insatiable, materialistic desire to supercede Barbara regardless of the costs.  The upper-middle class white matriarch, Candice, is comfortable living in a black world until her teenaged daughter begins dating a black man (Pearl's son).  Pearl owns the local beauty salon and lives in the much frowned upon townhouse development on the outskirts of Silver Lake. We are also shown the impoverished suburb of Seat Pleasant and meet Lee, a young victim of child abuse in search of her real father.<br />Briscoe builds excitement with Bradford's extramarital affairs, mystery with Lee's search for her father, and suspense with Candice's genealogical search for the truth.  Unfortunately this reader found that some of the story's climaxes fell short which made for slow reading at times. Nonetheless, Briscoe does a great job with character development.  She provides a solid background for each of the characters so the reader has a clear understanding of their behavior, fears, and motives. The author ends the story in such a way that the reader suspects a sequel may be needed to obtain closure on some open issues and deferred dreams.  I believe most Briscoe fans will not be disappointed with this novel because despite the intermittent lags P.G. County is a light, easy, entertaining summer read.  Briscoe remains on my favorite author list and will no doubt win more fans with this new release.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO Bookclub	2002-09-20

Granddaddy's Dirt will leave you wondering about the age-old adage of unjust deeds affecting future generations and the possibility of family curses.  The novel opens with a serious crime committed and covered up in rural southern Georgia. This single act is the catalyst for a series of events in the life of Andrew Scales, a respected businessman with a wife, two daughters, and two grandchildren.  Andrew is a proud, black man and pillar in the community who believes he has acted appropriately and righteously despite his wife's protests to the otherwise.  He feels justified in that he must protect his honor, his family, and his money at all costs and ignores her constant pleas to &quot;do the right thing&quot;.<br />As the story progresses through the years we watch a web of deceit and lies build to the brink of implosion for Andrew and his family.  At the center of the story is Andrew's undying love for his oldest grandchild, Kyle.  Unbeknownst to Kyle (the third generation), who has benefited greatly from his grandfather's wealth and reputation, very tough decisions are in order when he returns to take over the family business.  Through a series of clues, the truth starts to surface and Kyle slowly begins to unravel a twenty-year old mystery.  Cosmic forces are also at work and the evidence of a family curse is quickly upon him.  Will Kyle dismiss everything to let sleeping dogs lie?  Will he face the truth, break the cycle, and do what his grandfather refused to do?<br /><br />Granddaddy's Dirt is a thought-provoking novel that effectively uses metaphors, similes and vivid imagery which heighten the reader's apprehension and allow them to use their own intuition to determine what is going to happen next.  The symbolism of the 'dirt' and cleansing waters of the 'flood' was masterfully conveyed.  The Southern dialogue was &quot;readable and understandable&quot; while still seemingly authentic.  The scenes were indeed funny when they were intended to be comical and heartbreaking when they were to be sad.  There are some religious overtones in this book:  the concept of confessing sins, asking for forgiveness, loving thy neighbor, passing burdens and curses onto future generations may disturb some readers, but it does not take away from the novel.  However, I concur with another reviewer when she wrote that Granddaddy's Dirt could be used as an excellent example for teaching writing and storytelling techniques. This is good book for an easy, quick summertime read.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO Bookclub<br />Nubian Circle Book Club (Orlando, FL)heartbreaking when they were to be sad.

Thomas read the prologue to Threesome at an afternoon Montsho Booksigning, I knew I had to buy the book to finish the story...and I did that very night!  This is an exciting, easy-to-read, page-turner that anyone can enjoy.<br />The story is largely narrated by Sasha Bourianni, an attractive 38 year-old executive secretary whose affair with a married man triggers a series of events that sends her life into a whirlwind that includes a career change (a personal assistant to an NBA star), relationship issues with her employer, her ex-lover, and the new love of her life.  This is a short novel (about 130 pages) but the author gives us enough background on each character to help us understand their motivation and get into their psyche.  For example, Sasha's views of self worth stems from a life-long longing for her mother (who died while giving birth to Sasha) and a childhood of being raised by a hustling, swinging father.  Quite naturally, these experiences and unresolved issues shapes her adult ideologies on men, love, and sex and eventually explains her constant self-destructive behavior.<br />The supporting cast of characters was interesting as well and some had a few  secrets and drama of their own to keep your nose in the book.  I will admit, that based on the title and subtitle, I didn't think it would be the type of book I would want to read.  But after the first few pages, it was clear that my preconceived notions about the book were wrong.  I was hooked from the very beginning through the very end.  This is a perfect book for a lazy summer afternoon...	2002-09-15

Gonna Lay Down My Burdens is a great drama that opens strong and keeps the reader hooked until the very last page.  We are introduced to the story's central character, Carmen Taylor, on her wedding day when she has an eerie, apprehensive moment prior to receiving an urgent telephone call from her maid of honor, Desiree.  Desiree, Carmen's best friend and drama queen, is having yet another domestic episode with live-in policeman boyfriend, Chester, and frantically asks Carmen to come rescue her.  When she arrives, a scuffle ensues and Carmen delivers a fatal blow to Chester's head.<br />As they flee to escape capture for the murder of a cop, Carmen relives her life in a series of flashbacks where we meet the primary characters of Chester, Burl (Carmen's fianc&eacute;), Desiree and many other funny, interesting townsfolk of Belle Helene, Alabama.  Monroe skillfully allows us to experience the development of friendships, meet the town's dysfunctional families, and witness childhood crushes evolve into adult romances. As the story progresses, we clearly understand how the strong-willed Carmen with the big heart ultimately becomes so heavily burdened by guilt and shame to the point that she neglects her own happiness and nearly self destructs.<br />I think this book will fare well simply because it is a good story that is told very well.  Monroe's writing style is easy to follow and the book exhibits solid pacing.  With this being her third novel, I can say Monroe has earned a place on my favorite author list.<br />Phyllis<br />APOOO Bookclub<br />Nubian Circle Book Club (Orlando, FL)	2002-09-15
US	52109600	R1MKQ9QQ2GFNL3	0345444957	605284938	Growing Up X	Books	4	15	15	N	Y	A COURAGEOUS DEBUT	I commend Ilyasah Shabazz for her courage to publish her memoirs in Growing Up X. It is clearly an act of bravery for anyone to share intimate thoughts with the world. I found it surprising that she led a rather normal, non-eventful life in Mt Vernon, New York because I, like many others, perceived her (and her sisters) as the legacy of two remarkable parents-thus making her destined to supercede their combined greatness. Naturally, this is an unfair and often cruel expectation to place on children of infamous parents and Ilyasah shared how her mother worked hard to shield and protect them from the burden of proof. She also enlightens the reader by saying she often would not to tell people of her parentage when she first met them for just those reasons.<br />The memoir, which is largely a tribute to her mother, chronicles Ilyasah's life from her father's death to her mother's death.  She begins by mentioning the Little Family (her father's family) kept their distance in early years and how her immediate family was largely sustained by members of the local mosque, close friends, her mother's relatives, and high profile celebrities who showed her mother kindness and support in a time of need. Despite the generosities of others, it was her mother's resolve and personal sacrifices that kept the family together. She rehashes childhood memories of private school, summer camp, sisterhood bonding, and coming of age into adulthood. She speaks of her first kiss, her juvenile experiences with prejudice/racism, her loss of virginity from rape, the many career changes, and the loves of her life--one of which was an NBA player that she thought she might marry. These memories are simplistically and rather briefly written in a matter-of-factly type manner-almost like it's a series of flashbacks. The only exception is the heart-wrenching section where Ilyasah tells of her mother's battle for life after the fire set by Ilyasah's nephew, Malcolm, Quibillah's son. I felt her pain through the pages of the novel and my heart goes out to her family.<br />With the exception of a few events, I found Ilyasah's life to be quite ordinary and found myself wanting to learn more about the \\"holes\\" in the novel. For example, she mentions that she never had visited her father's gravesite until she was an adult in college. In fact, she did not know the gravesite's location upon arriving at the cemetery and just wandered around until she found it. I suppose I wanted to know why they never visited his grave as a family unit, even for Father's Day (considering all attempts made by her mother for a 'normal' mainstreamed life). The only explanation offered was that it would be too painful for her mother.<br />I found it equally extraordinary that her mother hires a home tutor to supplement their private school education ensuring they are properly and completely taught African history, Arabic, etc. but then Ilyasah admits to having to learn of her father's political ideologies, beliefs, and struggles by taking a humanities class on Malcolm X in college. It is only then that she comes to truly appreciate and comprehend his influence and effect on society. Surely since her father has his honorable place in American history, it almost seemed almost like an injustice to neglect this part of her heritage for so long. Despite what this reader thinks, I am sure Mrs. Shabazz, or \\"Mommy\\" as she is referred to throughout the book, had her reasons. I am not second-guessing her [Mrs. Shabazz] judgment, just asking for clarification that is not readily apparent in the book. Ilyasah tries to explain by stating that her mother taught them that he [Malcolm] was \\"Daddy\\" at home, nothing more and nothing less, which is totally justified.<br />I, too, was disappointed that the book concludes at Mrs. Shabazz's death because I ended up have more questions than when I started about Ilyasah and her family. I wanted to learn more about the Little family, Quibillah's FBI encounter (conspiracy to assassinate Louis Farrakhan), her sister's lives, and Malcom (the grandson).  From my understanding Ilyasah is working on a second novel about her parents, perhaps my questions will be answered in the upcoming body of work. ...iracy to assassinate Louis Farrakhan), her sister's lives, and Malcom (the grandson).

The View From Here is excellent! It goes deep into the soul and deep into the impoverished rural South into the home of Anna and J.T. where years of depression, predjudice, mental and physical abuse has taken its toll on the family. An unplanned pregnancy throws the family into crisis and the loss of employment makes a bad situation worse. J.T. &quot;fixes&quot; things by offering the unborn child to his older sister/surrogate mother, Clairese, the preacher's wife, and turns to corn liquor as console for his idle time. Anna eventually saves her family by (a) pulling on inspiration of her best friend, Ida Mae, who has &quot;gone up North&quot; in search of freedom and a better life and (b) her mother's strength to preservere and do the right thing. This book is a quick read, a real winner...I was really intrigued to see that it was written by a man! I give this body of work 5 stars and two thumbs up!	2002-04-29

West of Rehobeth is a coming of age story for a 12 year-old African American boy, Eddie Massey.

Uncle Rufus's life is truly tragic and full of misery...I felt deeply for the character and all that he represented.  However, I felt the book lagged...the beginning was slow, it gained momentum toward the middle and concluded with a dismal ending.  I was very disappointed with the conclusion.  It was a well written book with good character development...once it got going it was a solid body of work...but I had to take points away for the slow start and mediocre ending.

He is instantly smitten by her beauty and attracted to her strong, self-assured personality.  They meet again in Philadelphia when Lee joins his newspaper's staff.  He pursues her relentlessly and she reluctantly succumbs to his advances and they fall in love.<br />Although I thought the story started rather slowly, McLarin makes up for the sluggish start by expertly developing the leads of the story into believable and amiable characters.  She also really delivers with the presentation of the couple's individual and collective issues surrounding interracial relationships.  We learn about each character's upbringing and how that shapes and influences their perspectives on racism, politics, and dating.  McLarin kept the story \\"real\\" by injecting some very practical scenarios in which Lee and Porter are allowed be human; their fears, frustrations, and prejudices are revealed.  We see that they are not perfect.  In addition to societal pressures regarding interracial dating, they experience internal conflict and lukewarm reception from family members and close friends.<br />As I read \\"Meeting of the Waters\\", I couldn't help but wonder if it was a semi-autobiographical story because the innermost thoughts and actions of the characters seemed so real.  I enjoyed the novel and will add Ms. McLarin's first novel to my \\"to read\\" book list.	2002-03-21

She also illustrates the effects of making poor choices and the importance of `doing the right thing' at all times.

We are introduced to shallow characters and watch as they deal with crumbling marriages, self-discovery, and growth.

Each has good intentions but they all get pulled into three very difficult family situations....ironically, it's the brotherly strength and love (along with a feisty matriarch) that carries forth and pulls them through some very difficult times.<br />I liked Johnson's style of allowing each character to narrate their story.  The pace was just right and scenarios were believable; although it made me wince every time I read some words repeatedly used incorrectly outside of the character's dialogue (ex. fambly for family, axed for asked, etc.).  Otherwise, it was a great novel.	2002-03-03

I felt great pain for Ellen, an 11-year-old African-American girl, as I read about her abuse and long-suffering in a totally dysfunctional environment. It was extremely sad to see that most of the physical, verbal, and mental abuse came from her immediate family, including her mother.  The mother's reliance on the root worker's remedies to solve her marital problems, insecurities, and overall unhappiness exacerbates Ellen's misery because the root worker tends to involve Ellen as either the cause of the ills or part of the \\"cure\\".  At the urging of the Root Worker, Ellen is subjected to illogical arguments that test her Christian faith, more sexual abuse, and ingestion of ungodly concoctions.<br />Ellen's search for solace forces her into an alternate reality---I suppose this can be viewed as a mode of self-defense.  Outsiders view her as peculiar and ostracize her even more.  Most of the adults in the world tend to turn a blind eye to the outward physical abuse of this impoverished black child.  Because she has no friends, she invents Clarissa-whom she confides her deepest thoughts.  Luckily, she is befriended and rescued by a neighbor and things look up.<br />The novel is told through the eyes of Ellen and I found it a little hard to follow at times, especially when defining relationships of some of the key characters and their backgrounds.  There was lack of closure with some characters and I was left wanting to know more about their fate.  Overall, it was an enjoyable read.	2002-03-03

Only this time, the author educates and enlightens the reader through the eyes of the lead character, Peter Mango.  We journey from the Civil War Army and Navy skirmishes along coastal South Carolina to the political battles waged in the White House.  The uniqueness of the tale is it is told from the African-American point of view and the author does a good job sticking to the facts and of divulging how former slaves and freedmen fought for their rights and freedom during a very tumultuous time.<br />The story opens with Mango, a riverboat pilot forced into service by the Confederate Navy, orchestrating a nighttime flight to freedom by impersonating the Captain of the Confederate gunboat and taking the slave crew and their families to freedom by surrendering the ship to the Union Navy.  He becomes a war hero and serves with the Union eventually being promoted to Captain of the stolen ship.  His adventures are shared and history is told with a colorful cast of characters-all of whom are virtually in the same situation but each individual deals uniquely with their emotions when human issues such as separation from family; reclamation of lost family; freedom from slavery; fear of recapture and return to slavery, the legacy of master/slave relationships, etc. surface throughout the novel.  We also see Peter and the cast dealing with the confusion and unfairness of the Confederate and Union government's fluctuating policies and ordinances of the era.  She really conveys the realism and anguish that the African Americans of the time must have felt as a result of the attitude and treatment toward black soldiers, Lincoln's positions regarding the slaves, and the politics of the antebellum South that severely disenfranchised former slaves.<br />Meriweather does not sugar-coat the atrocities of war and the inhumanity of slavery, instead she recounts documented history in such a way that the reader feels the fear that stems from the uncertainty, hatred, and anxiety of the slave character's environment.  Laced with historical accounts, the novel substantiates the important role the black soldiers played in the Civil War and in American History.  The reader also lifts from the pages the resolve and determination of an oppressed people--people who were tired of being abused, people who embraced freedom, people who were determined to prove their worth, people who sought justice and equality, and people who were willing to die to obtain it.slavery, instead she recounts documented history in such a way that the reader feels the fear that stems from the uncertainty, hatred, and anxiety of the slave character's environment.

Color of Justice was a suspense filled novel with several story lines intertwined around the central plot.  The murder of a high profile couple sparks a killing spree among the elite group of African Americans.  The story follows tough, street-wise Detective Danny Cavanaugh as he takes us to Detroit's city hall, the affluent suburbs, and into the inner city to solve the murders.  Interesting, colorful characters from judges to prostitutes are introduced along the way and Hardwick's handling of dialog and character interaction adds credibility to each one of them.  I really liked the manner in which Hardwick managed the family and relationship sub-plots and how we &quot;hear&quot; Danny's innermost thoughts, concerns, and fears.  Kudos to Hardwick for braving the \\"colorism\\" issue -- although fictional... the views expressed by some characters could easily be based on fact. Overall, I really liked the book and would recommend it to others; however, I found the ending was sort of loose and weak, so I deducted a point for that.

Fullilove provides the reader with simply an interesting story of the how the wheels work in an almost non-fictional scenario of Washington today-it contains an international nuclear crisis; a major defense contractor engaging in questionable deals with foreign governments while supporting the presidential campaign; a high powered Washingtonian couple (a black National Security Advisor and the white daughter of the defense contractor); murder, espionage; betrayal, and cover-up.  I don't want to reveal too much because the book review provided gives the highlights.  It was a page-turner for me... I was determined to finish the book in a day just to see how it was all going to play out.  I was slightly disappointed in the ending so my true rating is a 4.5.<br />For those of you who enjoyed the movie, \\"Enemy of the State\\" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, you'll like this book.	2002-01-07

Raw and Rivoting.....<br />I think Ice T once said that trying to explain \\"the pimpin' game\\" to a normal, rational person is like trying to explain rocket science to a wino....you just won't get it. Well, Monique Morris's tale provides a look into the psyche of a pimp (Jesus), a prostitute (Angie/Peaches), their son (Jason), and a progressive thinking Black Panther woman (Chinaka/Jessica) where we get a fictionalized glimpse of their world, their lives, their circumstances, and their reasons and rationale for their actions. It's a sad, raw, dismal look at life on the streets, but it provides a clearer picture of how young, misguided adults can be lead astray by seasoned predators. Morris takes us full circle from the beginning with Angie as a teenager and how she entered the life; Jesus's entry into the pimpin' game; Jason's life; and Chinaka's entry into the Black Panther movement. The novel moves well, the interplay between the character's is handled well, and the surprise ending was an added bonus. I enjoyed this but would only recommend it to those who appreciate a raw, unrestrained novel.	2002-01-04

Told through a series of flashbacks to various time periods and ancestors interspersed with scenes from Lizzie's present and past, Stigmata is a haunting read.  Lizzie, at age 14, inherits her mysterious grandmother's trunk and upon opening it she discovers a quilt that awakens the spirits of the past.  Plagued by stigmata of her great-grandmother's wounds from slavery and periodic episodes of memories/time travel, Lizzie is institutionalized for 14 years.  She learns to play to game with her psychiatrists and is released to go home under the watchful care of her parents.  There she begins to make a quilt to  interconnect the generations and provide healing for herself and her family.  Stigmata was a quick and easy read for me...it kept me wanting to read it and I'm looking forward to Ms. Perry's next novel.	2001-12-26

The novel paints Jim Meserve as an ambitious and resourceful, yet also chauvanistic and sometimes violent man.  The central character is the wife, Arvay, who is timid, uneducated, and (overly) sensitive. Told from Arvay's point of view, the problem with the story is that it is essentially one-sided and is more like the story of her life from her point of view.  Only toward the later 1/3 of the book is she given a challenge and a mild conflict emerges when she is challenged to prove herself worthy of her husband.  Here is where I think the novel fails-we never really see any growth, development, or maturity in Arvay throughout the novel.  It is only in the last couple of chapters that she has a \\"self-awakening\\" experience caused by the death of her mother.  This \\"self-discovery\\" and the following reconciliation with Jim is weak and disappointing in my opinion.  I enjoyed the book, Hurston is simply a great story teller-- she paced it appropriately, injected lively dialog, believable characters and situations, and provided colorful imagery.  However, I think I would have enjoyed this story if it were two-sided; I found myself wanting to know more about Jim, his background, his thoughts and motivation.	2001-12-18

It tells the story of Kyla and Jefferson Blake, their picture-perfect 16-year marriage, and their commitment to one another and also to God.  Jefferson makes the mistake of sleeping with Kyla's best friend, Jasmine, showing that Christians are also faced with real trials and tribulations.  The lessons of the story are illustrated in how the characters overcame this event-dealing with the issues of trust, betrayal, love, redemption, and forgiveness.  The strength, belief in God, and the ability to act according to His wishes (despite desiring to do otherwise) is inspiring.  This novel moved well and was paced just right.<br />The supporting cast of characters was balancing:  Alexis and Brian both dear friends of Kyla and Jefferson begin a relationship together based on Christian values and go through their own temptations and issues, and Jasmine, the seductress, is relentless in her pursuit of Jefferson.<br />Murray sprinkles bible scriptures and words of love and faith to share the source of wisdom and power.  It is a delightful, easy read that isn't \\"preachy\\" or condemning...in fact, I think it renews the inner spirit. This is a definite must read for Christian couples or anyone needing another's forgiveness.	2001-12-01

October Suite is a coming-of-age story about a young woman who struggles to deal with her family and relationship issues.  Lillian \\"October\\" Brown and her sister, Vergie, are sheltered orphans raised by their two aunts because their father murdered their mother in their presence.  The novel begins when October leaves home in 1950 for the first time to begin her life as an educator.  Her naivety gets her into \\"trouble\\" and she returns home to give birth to her son by a married man.  She allows her married, childless sister, Vergie, and her husband to adopt the child and tries to resume her life.  Along the way, she deals with her curiosity and details surrounding her mother's death, the loss of her Aunts, the upbringing of her son, her career, her relationship with men and her sister.<br />The novel starts slowly but we see October as she matures, grows, and develops into a caring and smarter woman.  The novel wraps up a little too quickly in my opinion with the door open for a sequel.  I would have rated it a 3.5 if allowed, but feel comfortable bumping it up to a four.	2001-11-25

Although this book started slowly, I thought it pulled things together nicely toward the end.  This story was told by a nameless, super-sensitive man, who loved Nicole even after leaving him at the altar years earlier.  He soon learns that Nicole is in love with another woman and in his blind love for Nicole he agrees to meet the \\"other woman\\", Ayanna.  The lead character struggles when Nicole asks him if he will share a bed with her and Ayanna.  The story continues and explores the dilemma the title character faces as he considers the offer, tries to win Nicole back, and deals with other relationship issues with his father.  We also see the issues that Nicole faces with her super-religious mother and Ayanna.  Each must struggle to make decisions that would change the rest of their lives.<br />Dickey has penned a book that contains a great deal of explicit heterosexual and lesbian sex which may be appealing to some and repulsive to others.  It stretches the imagination and has a real feel to it...like Dickey has personal experience with the issues.<br />I enjoyed the book...it wasn't what I expected, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.	2001-11-21

I finished it within a few hours and really enjoyed it.  Again, in the same style of Redemption Song, Berry, intertwines the past and present masterfully.  The essence of the story is that of the spirits of the past manifesting themselves out of the need tell their stories to the living in an effort ease the pain, bring peace, and resolve issues that plagued their lives.  There are many lessons taught in this story, however, the focus is on the spirit, Ngozi, an African slave, and his desire to bring back the love, passion, and true unifying purpose that the drums of African once did in his beloved homeland.  He feels that the drums/beats have been misused and corrupted and he must connect with super producer, Harry \\"Freedom\\" Hudson before its too late.  There were some surprising twists in the plot as each of the supporting cast experiences their own awakenings.  I was disappointed in some of the conclusions, but it was a great work nonetheless...highly recommended!	2001-11-06

I'd read so many positive reviews about Ansa and in fairness, I read Baby of the Family and Ugly Ways prior to this title and must conclude that I'm not into her writing style.  She has a very descriptive, detailed writing style that consumes pages upon pages of text that describe the environment but is so very weak on plot and story line.  I know this was the sequel to Baby of the Family, but I felt she retold the same story within this one.  Like in Baby of the Family, I kept waiting for something to happen to/with Lena, the main character.  Sure, she summons up a ghost and has lots of sex and love..but basically, that's it.  I kept waiting for a dramatic climax, but there was none.  The problem is, every time the story started to move forward and show a little conflict (a female ghost rival, an angry town that feels forgotten by Lena), the conflict is resolved far too easily. The book encourages us to stop concentrating on the material and enjoy life as Lena learned to do..but her transformation was dull and truly uneventful for me.  It took a lot for me to finish this book..and I had to skim/speed read to make it through it.  I'm still trying to figure out what all the hype was about.....I'd agree with another reviewer and  put this one at the bottom of the three Ansa books.  In my opinion, this book could have been written in half the text and had the same impact.	2001-11-06

Annette is an impoverished, intelligent, obese, lonely, fatherless child who is often left alone with Mr. Boatwright, a seemingly innocent, bible-quoting, one-legged boarder taken in to help her mother financially. She's basically an outcast who suffers from ridicule, racism, and low self-esteem inflicted from adults and children alike. The tale starts with Mr. Boatwright using Annette's weaknesses to molest her constantly throughout her childhood. Her life is turned around when her beautiful and popular neighbor, Rhoda Nelson, embraces her as a friend. The plot thickens as Annette and Rhoda's stories trace the progression of their friendship and the sharing and revelation of family secrets. The novel had some unexpected twists and a surprise ending (at least it didn't end the way I thought it would) which added to the appeal of the story. Overall, I enjoyed the book - the author exhibited expert handling of the music and historic events of the era and seemed to have left the story open for a sequel....I hope she follows through...I'd like to revisit Annette and friends.	2001-10-28

The novel focuses on the lives of Mudear, her three daughters (Betty, Emily, and Annie), and husband (Ernest) and the havoc she caused in their lives. The author weaves back and forth through time to paint a sad story of children struggling to make sense and adjust to a night-time gardening, TV-watching, self-absorbed, man-hating, non-nurturing, dictator-like mother. While the husband/father, Ernest Lovejoy, can escape into his job at the chalk mines, the everlasting effect she has on her children's life is profound. Mudear believed she was instilling virtues of self-reliance, independence, and self-confidence into her daughters, but soon learns (via her ghost) the motherly lessons has wrecked havoc in their adult relationship with men, has lead one daughter into a rushed marriage just to escape from home, and contributed to another's nervous breakdown. Although all the girls are successful professionally, it stems from their desire to please Mudear and satisfy her very high expectations. The pivotal event is the mother's funeral where it brings the family together and only then do the years of suppressed anger, resentment, and frustration finally surface and the healing begins. The book is easy to read and follow-there are detailed descriptions, and lots of funny, entertaining dialogue to keep the story flowing.	2001-10-26

The story is centered around Josephine Chambers, a successful business executive and Ross Buchanan, a scholar pursuing his PhD in Anthropology. They &quot;accidentally&quot; meet at the Black Images Bookstore in search of the very rare book entitled Children of Grace. While in the store, both discover the book at the same time, which lead the wise proprietress, Ms. Cozy, to referee a joint reading session between the two. Over the next few days, the voice of their ancestor speaks to them and discloses timeless wisdom, acts of courage, love, selflessness, and hope onto the couple. I don't want to reveal too much, but I'd like to say the author weaves an inspiration and heart touching tale that includes a message, &quot;The Recipe of Life&quot;, that we can all heed and embrace.<br />I initially borrowed this book from the public library, but will procure a copy for my personal library. It is one I will present as gifts for my family and friends to perpetuate the message.

I had read so many great things about the author that I decided to check out all her books starting from the beginning with Baby of the Family.  Although I think the author did a great job with imagery and detailed description, I was somewhat slightly disappointed with the plot.  It started off great - Lena's birth with the veil over her face, visits from ghosts, and the superstitious undertones set the tone for a juicy plot and then NOTHING for the majority of the book.  I was so disappointed; the novel had great potential to be so much better.<br />It went on to become an elongated coming of age story that concentrated on select moments of Lena's adolescence.  Interesting characters were sprinkled in the book; but often exited with no closure to their story lines.  I actually found myself wanting to know more about other characters, as they were more interesting than the mediocre clips into Lena's teenage years.<br />I enjoyed the author's style but questioned the delivery of plot.  I haven't given up on the author, I hope to jump into Ugly Ways next.	2001-10-18

In Mary Monroe's novel, The Upper Room, Mama Ruby dominates as the central character that is so religious, malicious, and comical. She and her supporting cast are so drama-filled that their dysfunctional lives provide the reader with a page-turning/must-keep-reading tale.<br />Mama Ruby is an obese, misguided crazed, crucifix wearing, switchblade carrying, self-professed &quot;Christian&quot; woman with healing hands that manipulates and controls everyone around her. She betrays her closest friend in the world, Othella, by taking Othella's once-thought stillborn daughter, Maureen, and raises her as her own. She sequesters the child in a sanctified &quot;Upper Room&quot; that has restrictions on who can enter it and vows that Maureen will never leave her. The story includes a colorful cast of characters and takes us through Maureen's life with the townsfolk of Goons, FL and her desires and eventual escape into the sanity of the &quot;real world&quot;. Along the way, there are many 'episodes' that keep the plot flowing till the end.<br />This review does not give the novel enough praise.

However, after reading this book, I cannot recommend it to my family who are advanced readers.<br />From the standpoint of the three short stories, the author provided a very positive message for teens (especially girls) by illustrating consequences of traveling down the &quot;wrong path&quot; and spoke highly of self-respect, self-love, Christian values, and positive thinking.<br />The novel faltered badly in the areas of grammatical construct, overall editing, and dialogue handling.  There were too many instances of single sentences starting with &quot;I&quot;, switching tenses, repetitive uses of the same adjectives and adverbs, and young adults &quot;speaking&quot; like 8 year olds. These errors made it difficult to want to keep reading this book, but I perservered because I wanted to finish it to rate it fairly.<br />The author admitted this was her first novel and I commend her for following her dreams but prior to her next release I'd strongly recommend finding a professional editor.	2001-10-17

This is a story of Ruth Johnson, a victim of 14 years of domestic violence at the hands of her \\"psycho\\" husband, Eric.  It is told from her perspective and provides the reader with a unique glimpse into the mind of an abused woman.  We get to see how she rationalizes staying in an abusive relationship and her coming of wisdom and strength to leave.  It's a journey of self-discovery that addresses issues of self worth, self doubt, overcoming fear, etc. that everyone experiences in varying degrees and various times throughout life.  We see a transformation in the central character, Ruth.  She grows from a timid, fearful person into a self-respecting, self-loved, businesswoman who knows exactly what she wants and needs in her life.<br />This journey is not traveled in isolation.  The author weaves in a supporting cast of colorful characters:  In addition to her abusive ex-husband, Eric, she has a no nonsense best friend, Bernie, who saves Ruth's life in more ways than one; Clara, the surrogate mother; Adrian, the charming new man in her life, and May, the new friend, who's shared a similar past of her own.<br /><br />This is a good debut novel.

I didn't know what to expect based on the title and the cover.  I'd heard good things about Mr. Weber, but never read any of his works.  This was a book club choice and I wasn't disappointed!  It kept my interest to the very end.  The author has well defined, fully developed story line for each character in which each has a lesson/message that must be told.  Kyle, Wil, Allen and Jay are lifetime, \\"true-blue, tight-like-glue\\" friends and are a likeable group of guys that the reader feels comfortable with regardless of their situation.  There's Jay-the playa, Kyle-the successful business man with a Caucasian wife, Allen-the nice guy/\\"Momma's Boy\\" with the gold digger girlfriend, and Wil - \\"Mr Huxtable\\", devoted family man.  They all have some serious family/life issues that are dealt with resulting in some VERY surprising outcomes.

My nose was glued to the pages&#8212;simply stated I was fixated with Child of God from the first sentence in the novel through the end wondering how the whole drama was going to play out in Downtown, TN, Detroit and Lansing, MI.  This novel has it all: voodoo/mysticism, murder, incest, family secrets, misguided emotion all wrapped up within primarily three generations of the Boten family.  Files does an excellent job moving back and forth through time and giving each character their own history (even though a bit sordid at times).  Almost everyone in the Boten family struggles with one emotion &#8220;love&#8221; &#8211; how to show it, what it means, what they&#8217;ll do to receive it, the effects of misguided love, etc.  They are on a road of self-discovery where the truth is slowly revealed and ends with a semblance of resolution.<br />The critic's reviews give a solid overview of the novel, so I won&#8217;t repeat it here.

She's on a path of healing and self-discovery that takes many twists and turns.<br />The same path of self-discovery reveals some hidden truths for Martha and Janice...and although extremely painful and candid as it is...each manages to either stand willingly or be dragged before the mirror for self-examination before the therapy can begin.  Britney, a mother and wife, comes to realize that she's blessed and is not afraid to acknowledge that despite the circumstances that led her to her current situation.<br />MJH is a relationship master digging beneath the surface and examines the psyche of her characters (both male and female) to give them life and an uncanny realism.

It was a very enjoyable read spanning three generations and fifty years. In the early part of the novel, the two primary characters, Hosanna Clark and Gilda Rosenstein, one black, one Jewish form a friendship and business only to end in Gilda betraying Hosanna. The remainder of the story includes an interesting cast of characters who are largely members and friends of both families including one of Hosannas daughters (Matriece Triesey Carter) who learn of Gildas perfidy from their mother and feels obligated to right the wrongs done to her mother. The plot thickens as the history, hidden agendas, and background of the characters are revealed. Without revealing too muchthere were lessons to be learned in the lives of these charactersthe pain of vengeance, peace of atonement, and the power of forgiveness. Campbell crossed race and socio-economic lines to bring life to a great novel.<br />Although some parts were slow and in this readers opinion I think it could have been shortened, this was a true page-turner, especially in the last 1/3 of the book.

I'd heard so many great accolades for the Arabesque Romances that I was really excited to have the opportunity to read one. <br />Well, unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed.  Although the novel had the murder mystery, parallel love affair, and &quot;damsel in distress/knight in shining armor&quot; (Kennedy St. James/Max Collier) components--it still fell flat.  The elements for a great story was there but seemed to be lacking character depth for the central characters and I found myself wanting to know more about the supporting cast.  The end also seemed to be a bit rushed and forced.<br />Overall, I would rate it a 2.5 if it were allowed, but I don't feel generous enough to push it up to a three.  I am willing to read other works by Ms Byrd and other Arabesque authors.	2001-08-20

This book was selected as our Book Club's Book of the Month and I was somewhat disappointed after reading the book.  I'd heard so many great accolades for the Arabesque Romances that I was really excited to have the opportunity to read one.<br />Well, unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed.

He brings back a mix of characters from his previous best sellers focusing on John Basil Henderson and Yancy-only this time they must come face to face with their \\"secrets\\" and themselves in the midst of deceit, vengeance, and passion. Any Way The Wind Blows is a page-turner, however, the ending felt rushed with a lot of open, unresolved issues.....I assumed these will be addressed in another release.  This wasn't his best work; but it was enjoyable as a summer read.	2001-08-05

I thought this book was very well written with a cast of interesting characters, witty on-liners, and cleaver dialog.  Cleage's writing style is truly enlightening and inspiring - she focuses on \\"life issues\\" like self-love/acceptance, courage/inner strength, and self reliance - delivering messages through the scenarios and characters in Idlewild.  Although I would have liked her to have deeper defined the concept of the \\"free woman\\" and the shared more background of some of the supporting cast, like the Lattimores, Sister, and the twins...but perhaps that's for another book.  Overall, it was a great summer read with a happy ending.  I enjoyed it and look forward to her next release.	2001-08-05
US	52109600	R220DRLT97KXHK	0060184760	251599419	The Justus Girls	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	A Great Novel	Lambright mixes the right amount of suspense, drama, and detail into this novel to make The Justus Girls a page-turner and easy read.  Her storytelling ability is great--drawing us into their world, providing us insight into each of the four main character's background and watching them grow into adulthood.<br />The story opens with the murder of one of the JG's, a childhood drill team that blossomed four friends, who reunite and rekindle their friendship as they vow to find the killer of their dear friend.  The book takes them on a journey of self discovery and growth and their experiences strengthen the bonds of friendship discovered early in childhood.<br />This is a well written novel with many interesting, colorful characters, and sub-plots.  It moves and reads well.  I'm looking forward to Ms. Lambright's next body of work.	2001-07-29

I am an avid reader, and I've read all of Ms Cooper's works and this one is the best books I've ever read. She has a gift and uses it well.  It is extremely well written and the message has universal appeal that is timeless regardless of the reader's gender, sex, or age.  It is a phenomenal work!  I recommend it to everyone.	2001-06-28
US	52109600	R2I8KLPJ3BKDS0	0887392733	444522	Sight of the Lord	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An Enlightening Read....	Curie Nova provided me with a copy of her work and I really didn't know what to expect when I first heard the title. I thought it would be some type of religious undertaking. It was not. This work contained very realistic characters, dialogue, and situations. Her descriptions of her character(s) frustrations, experiences, and pains were so convincing to the point I wondered if this were truly a work of fiction. I was with her all the way until the end and then she lost me during the epiphany. I'll have to review that section again-however, I understood her message (one that I believe and support) and truly appreciate this body of work. Ms. Nova is a good author and storyteller I look forward to her next release.	2001-06-26

In addition to her her comments, I thought this book had a slow start and poor editing in my opinion.  The potential to make this a great novel was truly missed by not &quot;connecting the dots&quot; or following through with patterns/behaviors that were detailed earlier in the novel (Basil's tendency for violence in childhood but not adulthood, Anne's concern for her nieces/nephews, etc.).  I thought this made for inconsistent character behavior.<br />As far as the history lesson goes...obviously she did a lot of research; but other than the parts relating to Memphis and the Russell family; I couldn't relate the other historical events (timeline) to what was happening to the characters in the book.  If there was a correlation; it was light or I missed it.<br />I, too, felt it was a hurried rush to close the novel and in doing was left with many unanswered questions and a lack of closure on some minor issues.  I couldn't help but feel as if this novel were pushed out to meet some type of deadline.<br />This was my first book by Rosalyn McMillan.  I am willing to read others by her.	2001-06-19
