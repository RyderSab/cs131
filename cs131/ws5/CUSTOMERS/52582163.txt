I picked this book up expecting it to be a very easy read but was surprised when I found myself reading through a book that would not have been out of place in any of my college history courses. Fraser has painted a very fascinating picture of various warrior queens around the world. Though at times, the narrative drags through her meticulous statement of facts, that is to be expected. I was very disappointed at her omission of the Egyptian pharaoh-queen Hatshepsut, however. Nevertheless, the women that she picks to include in her analysis make up a very good overview of the various warrior queens throughout the world and through time. It was an extremely interesting read and I would recommend it for anyone who has an interest in historical women as well as the the patience to read a (mostly) scholarly work.	2004-01-23

Tyldesley's writing was clear and easy to read, as well as being amusing at times. This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn about Egyptian culture as well, since she does very well at creating the background context. I highly recommend this book for any scholar of Egypt.	2003-03-10

Imagine my dismay when I found it was out of print! So I am really glad that it is finally back in print. This is a wonderful story of a truly different fairy tale. It has a human aspect to it and makes you really empathize with Amy and Perry. The pictures are as charming as I remember them. My only complaint is that I loved the older cover wtih Amy in the purple dress better and that this copy doesn't have the gorgeous colored pictures in it.	2002-09-20

The characters had flaws, though the elves were a bit sterotypical.  And a hero that is immune to magic is a new idea, and how the author carries it out is wonderful.  I also liked how McKeone wove in  Norse mythology into the story.  The reason this book has four stars  instead of five is because the ending is a cliff-hanger that just screams  sequel, but there never was one published, which is a shame becauase there  is a lot more that could be done with Dav.	2000-04-01

'A Civil Campaign' is typical Lois Bujold - humor, intrigue, intelligence, and with little life lessons peppered throughout. A wonderful addition to the series.	1999-08-25

The ending of the book just begged for at least one more enstallment to this lovely series. Though there was one thing that I did  not like and that was the fact that Spacedep was the antagonist in all  three books. I should think that after the first two incidents involving  Spacedep that they would have tried to keep it out of the Gringg affair.  But all in all, a great book and *hopefully* more to come.	1999-07-06

This book is very tongue in cheek and does get a bit cliche at times. With this book, it's better not to think too much and just let it take you along. True, this book isn't the most intellectual (except maybe for the chapter numbers), but it's very entertaining. And if you study the appendix in which the chapter numbers are explained, you might learn something!	1999-06-25

The book is touching as it causes you to understand the hardships both characters faced. The thing that I found very interesting is the  parallels between the 1600s and the 1980s. The author took two completely  different stories that should have had nothing to do with each other and  combined them into one. There are cross-over phrases that are used in both  stories and two versions of the same character (e.i. Jonathon/Sean,  William/Bill) that were truely interesting. The ever present symbolism of  the swans and the white rose toward the end of the book made the stories  more poignant and thought provoking. Though some may say that the two  stories have nothing to do with one another, they actually do in fact  parallel each other to create a story that will be remembered. I forsee Peg  Kerr becoming one of the major voices of fantasy in a few years.	1999-06-21

It's neat to see how different authors interpreted the song and provided their own little twists. To the people who say that the story is repetitive...You have no  idea what you were talking about. Each story was different from the one  before it; though the main points were the same (ghost, spell, Lammas  night), that was the only thing that was. I found myself enjoying the  stories and wondering how each author would make each one new and  interesting. I especially loved Miranda and Lady of the Rock. If you find  the stories repetitive, read them one at a time whenever you feel bored.	1999-06-17

I read it and loved it. It was my favorite book for years after that. I was so disappointed when I discovered that this book was out of print. It is  one of the few books that are truely worthy of the title  &quot;classic&quot;. Once you read this book, you'll remember it forever. I  think that is really what a classic is, not a book that controversial or  written a long time ago, but a book that stays with you for the rest of  your life. And for me, this book is truely is a classic.	1999-06-05

While this book was fantasy, it had a classical English style that made it seem more like Jane Eyre than some of the modern  fantasy books. Also, I loved this book because it was realistic; it may  have been fantasy but it didn't try to PROVE it was by stuffing dragons,  unicorns, elves and fairies down your gullet every minute.

The author does not know how to keep the book interesting. The characters were flat uninteresting. When I heard there was  a third book, I decided to give the series another try. The third book  stank worse than the first two. The only reason that I kept reading was  because I forced myself. With a different author, the story might have  actually gone somewhere else besides back to the bookstore. Dull, lacked  polish, and was just plain terrible.	1999-05-08

But then in the next chapter, she told who it was. The book might have been better  if she had left the reader in the drak for most of the book like most  mysteries are. Also, this story line was not what I was expecting at all. I  had loved the other books in this series, but this one didn't seem like  part of the series at all. It had a darker undertone and would have seemed  more in place in New York or San Francisco. I didn't get the  \\"fantasy\\" feel from this book. Sure, magic was mentioned, but it  didn't seem to fit the story line at all.	1999-04-30

I loved it, and all of you who think this book sucked, I have no idea what the hell you were  reading. I can't wait to read the new series that Ms. Pierce is writing  about Tortall. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it  ended with you not knowing what happened to Daine and Numair, I mean, what?  What happens to them? They are such a cute couple, and you know that they  liked each other for the loooongest time. Especially in Emperor Mage. Read  all the books that she's written, including the Circle of Magic.

Frank Baum and some of the more recent ones. I can tell you right now that this book spoiled Oz for me. I can't imagine Oz having computers and telephones. The author may have  tried to recreate the land of Oz, but he did not succeed. He kept going  back to different books that Baum wrote about Oz, telling about this or  that, and that was basically what the first two or three chapters were  about! And also, I never really got into this book as I did with the  others, for me, this book wasn't Oz. Gardner may have thought he was doing  a good job, but I didn't. Oz is supposed to be a magic place, if there are  computers and telephones and the like, it takes the magic away. And Glinda  never had Oz transported to another dimension, she made it invisible or  something, not to another dimension. For people who love Oz the way Baum  and the other authors depicted it, don't read this book. It really does  take away from the world that Baum created and others just improved upon.  Gardner shouldn't have written this book, in my opinion, it shouldn't have  ever been written. Just leave Oz the way it is.	1998-11-02

Luke couldn't talk to her one chapter and  she suddenly had a voice? The whole thing was just unrealistic. Even if she  was a Jedi. How can you be trapped in a computer for so long and not have  made your presence known? And why was Luke the only one to snap out of the  brain-washing thing? And there was another Emperor's Hand?

There is a much darker undertone to the story, much more 'adult' than The Outlaws of Sherwood or Beauty. Yet, I loved the story. It was masterfully crafted and though it took awhile for the plot to move along, the wait was worth it. On my first reading of this book, I must admit that I hated it. However, I reread it several years later after I had grown up some and recognized the subtley in the plot and the beautiful imagery that McKinley uses.	1998-08-03
