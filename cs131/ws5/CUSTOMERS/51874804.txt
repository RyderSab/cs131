She winds a fast-paced story through several subplots just to make sure she has captured everyone's attention.  I'm sure those not encapsulated don't have a pulse because she's incredible.  She writes a tale that keeps you turning pages as fast as you can until the very end only to catch your breath and realize you immediately want another of her books to read.<br /><br />Harlow Grail is the young teenage daughter of an actress and wealthy plastic surgeon.  Her life is privileged and she lacks for nothing.  That comfortable life changes to horror when she's kidnapped.  Timmy, the son of the Grail housekeeper, is with her and also becomes a victim since he can identify the captors.  When Kurt, the kidnapper, discovers that the Grails have contacted the police against his warnings, he suffocates Timmy and cuts off Harlow's pinkie.  She miraculously escapes when she realizes he will soon kill her too.  Her missing pinkie is a constant reminder throughout her life of this ordeal and the loss of her friend.<br /><br />Twenty-three years later, Harlow Grail has changed her name to Anna North.  She lives a new life in which no one knows her past.  New Orleans is the home for this renowned mystery writer and she likes the secluded life she leads.  All is well until Anna's mother tells the press that Harlow is alive and well in New Orleans with a new identity.  People start putting two and two together and the trail leads to Anna.<br /><br />Soon after, murders begin to occur.  When one victim has her pinkie sliced off, Anna begins to think Kurt has found her and is coming to kill her.  Quentin Malone, homicide detective and hunk, is assigned to the case and meets Anna.  Romantic sparks soon fly and the reader is tossed from a romance theme to a psychological thriller and back again.  Malone and his partner must try to protect Anna and the best way to do so is find the killer before he finds her, if he is Kurt.<br /><br />Spindler excels at either her research of New Orleans or she has visited/lived there.  Her vivid descriptions of various places make the reader want to visit.  Even the description of the foods can make your mouth water!  I'm not sure if it's research or she shares some of her favorite places with us in this book.<br /><br />Another thing that makes Spindler outstanding is her fast paced storyline.  She develops characters to which the reader can relate.  And each of these characters is likeable - I found myself drawn to Anna.  I found myself wanting to shake her mother for slipping and telling the world where her daughter is living and all but giving them her new identity.

US	51874804	RFL1N5TK9CNCH	0553802380	89887514	The Next Accident	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Predictable But Still Fun	Lisa Gardner realizes a great duo when she has one, so she builds another story around the twosome of Pierce Quincy and Rainie Connor.  In this tome, someone is killing people near and dear to Quincy.  The reader is grabbed from the beginning with a seduction that ends in murder, whose victim just happens to be Quincy's oldest daughter, Amanda.  Narrowing the list of people who have a grievance with Quincy is not an easy task since he's an FBI profiler and has helped put away numerous criminals.  Is it one of those or someone new?  So Rainie comes flying to his aid to help stop this murderer before Quincy loses anyone else close to him.<br /><br />The story line is at times predictable, but the identity of the killer may elude some.  SpoilerThe part about Quincy's ex-wife, Bethie, falling for a man she hardly knows, and not telling anyone about him, is a bit farfetched.  Everyone could see that murder coming!End Spoiler<br /><br />With Quincy fast becoming a key suspect due to the diligence of the villain in setting him up for these crimes the pace of the book picks up speed.  Quincy, Kimberly (his other daughter), and Rainie go to Portland, Oregon where they will be safe while trying to figure out who is behind these crimes which is the best part of this mystery.<br /><br />A few items in this book are a bit hard to comprehend.  Quincy is usually self-reliant and so self absorbed that I don't think he'd ask for anyone's help, even if it were someone with whom he had an emotional attachment.  And why would Quincy ask for help investigating a crime that happened fourteen months previously (Amanda was in a coma for that length of time)?  Why not investigate sooner?  And how many wrecked cars have any parts still available after that length of time?  I doubt many!<br /><br />At times I wanted to smack Rainie for her smart mouth and hardcore personality.  But that seems to be what attracted Quincy in the first place, so those traits remained steadfast.  Quincy has a problem trusting anyone and opening up, but seems to be forced to trust Rainie during this time.  This is the beginning of not only a trust thing, but the sparks begin to ignite a bit more than we previously saw.  It's obvious, but it works.<br /><br />Plot development picks up speed and the reader is soon holding on to the edge of his/her seat.  Gardner may start out slow at times, but she definitely has the plot twists in full swing by mid book.  She's a master at tying up all the loose ends before the last page and throws in a couple of extras just for good measure.<br /><br />Character development is a bit of a let down.  Rainie's overbearing personality is a bit over-the-top and we don't get to know her any better than we do in the beginning.  We learn a few tidbits more about Quincy, but not much.  Kim is the only one being developed in this book.<br /><br />Even with its flaws, THE NEXT ACCIDENT is definitely one to read.  It will keep even the most die-hard mystery fan glued to the pages until the end.as a problem trusting anyone and opening up, but seems to be forced to trust Rainie during this time.

What exactly would you do if you were a priest and heard the confession of a man who was going to commit a sin?  Then toss in the fact that this crime will be the murder of your sister?  That's the basis of HEARTBREAKER by Julie Garwood.  I was grabbed from the first page with the remark, \\"Bless me Father, for I will sin.\\" and it only held on tighter throughout the book.  This is the first in a contemporary romantic suspense series by Garwood, and each book is excellent!<br /><br />Father Tom Madden is the unlucky priest who hears the confession of this crazy man who calls himself \\"The Heartbreaker\\".  Tom's torn between his duty as a priest and protecting his beautiful sister, Laurent.  He calls upon his college buddy, FBI Agent Nick Buchanan, and asks for his help.  Nick had been going on a long overdue vacation, almost to the point of burnout, yet he agrees to spend that time in the small town of Holy Oaks helping to protect Laurent.<br /><br />Laurent isn't too keen on the idea of having her perfectly ordered, although busy life interrupted with a bodyguard, even if he is drop dead gorgeous!  She'd much rather concentrate on stopping a local land developer from tearing down the local town square where her business is located.  Giving in to her brother because of his current health issues, they devise a plot to let Nick stay in her home and try to find the bad guy.  Nick and Laurent pretend to be engaged so the good people of Holy Oaks won't be suspicious.  Ok, most readers can see right through this and realize that sparks will fly and a romance will definitely be on the horizon.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for said sparks, but that's part of the charm of this book.  If I had to pick two of my favorite attributes, it would have to be the romantic sparks and the characters of Holy Oaks.  Character is the operative word in that description!  Character development is excellent.  We're brought into the world of Laurent and Nick and instantly root them on in the escapades they encounter.  But the support characters are the colorful ones.  Father Tom playing football with kids sets a picture in my mind of a kind, young, priest who loves people.  Two of my favorites people are Bessie Jean and Viola Vanderman.  They may be elderly women, but they speak their minds and it's a riot every time they do!<br /><br />The tale is good, not great, but very much above average.  The revealing of the villain is a bit of a surprise, but some may figure it out ahead of time.  If the mystery doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat, the hot and steamy love scenes sure will.  Garwood has a perfect blend of romance and suspense and there is a little bit of excitement for everyone.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't my favorite book in the series, but it is definitely fun to read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it for a cold, rainy weekend.the escapades they encounter.  But the support characters are the colorful ones.

This was one of the exceptions!  There seemed to be little meat to the story and instead Howard tried to make up for it with steamy, very descriptive sex scenes.  So was it espionage or sex that was the basis of this book?  I'm still confused on that question.<br /><br />CIA contract agent Lily Mansfield is on a personal mission.  Salvatore Nervi is a slime ball from whom the CIA sometimes gets limited information in exchange for them overlooking his rather nasty business escapades.  But when Nervi kills Lily's friends, Averill and Tina, along with their adoptive adolescent daughter, Lily goes after him with a vengeance.  After she kills Salvatore, CIA director, Frank Vinay, sends Lucas Swain on a secret mission to bring back Lily before the Nervi's can seek revenge.<br /><br />Sounds like it could have been a great story, at least the outline was good.  But Linda Howard falls short on story development, as well as character growth.  The story didn't grab me as usual.  I floundered along wondering when that hook would come out.  Nope, never happened.  Instead I was given a story with way too many coincidences and happenstance filled with the sexual exploits of Lily and Swain.<br /><br />The numerous characters in this book aren't interesting enough to keep your attention for long.  Even though there are a variety of characters none show pizzazz.  Lily is self reliant and good at what she does.  Swain is depicted numerous times through the book as \\"swaggering\\" - a man with confidence and good looks.  Subcharacters are Frank Vinay of whom we only get a glimpse; Rodrigo Nervi a little more developed but still we're left wondering what makes him tick; Dominic Nervi, again only a quick look into his character.<br /><br />Now if I stopped reading the book and let my imagination run wild with this foundation laid, which could add some excitement to this storyline.  When the Alpha Male meets the Alpha Female sparks should fly, blood should flow, tempers flair, passion erupt.  That doesn't happen and we're left wondering at the wet-noodle characterization.  Blah!<br /><br />The ending was extremely predictable and not very exciting.  Everything was wrapped up neatly, but it didn't grab you - in fact, I set the book down and picked it up later- that's something that should never happen during the story climax!<br /><br />Spoiler<br /><br />A few of the side plots were unnecessary or could have added a new layer to the story but didn't.  For example, Frank Vinay being in a car accident that leaves him unconscious was needed so Swain couldn't consult with him.  But why not make it part of a bigger plot instead of something that leaves the reader shaking his/her head?  It could have been so much more interesting!<br /><br />End Spoiler<br /><br />Overall KISS ME WHILE I SLEEP is ok but not thrilling and definitely not one of Linda Howard's best stories.

Not so with REUNION, I figured this one out right away, but it did leave me wondering if this was supposed to be a mystery or a romance novel.  Either way, it was average.<br /><br />The story focuses on Gabriel Connor, a wealthy man whose life is turned upside down when a drunk driver kills his parents and severely injures him in a car accident.  When he awakens from a coma Gabriel has changed.  He now hears a voice in his head asking for help.  At first Gabriel thinks it's the medication or the blow to the head, but when the voice doesn't leave, he begins to worry about his sanity.  He confides in his Uncle Mike (not really his uncle, but a man who has known him most of his life, and his parents' best friend).  Uncle Mike consults with a psychic, Laura Dane, and convinces her to come to Gabriel's aid.<br /><br />When Laura and Gabriel meet, she knows instantly that they will be more than casual acquaintances - they will become lovers.  Wow, that must take the fun out of courtship.  Anyway, she agrees to help Gabriel figure out to whom the voice belongs.  When a series of murders begins to take place, it happens to coincide with Gabriel's sleepwalking and visions of these murders.  The murderer is known as the Prince Charming Killer because he leaves a rose with the corpse.  Gabriel's mother just happened to be a rose fanatic, which ties him to the killer by the obsession of removing the thorns from the blooms.<br /><br />Spoiler<br /><br />Ok, so it's a great foundation for a good story, but it becomes obvious and average when Gabriel is locked in jail and another murder occurs.  It's a dead giveaway when Gabriel hears his name called in a vision by the victim.  And what about Uncle Mike - you mean to tell me that a twin is locked away in a home and Mike's best friends never confide that information?  Gabriel never has any memories of his brother?  Give me a break!  And the ending... well, I'll not spoil it completely, but it was so predictable, it was anticlimactic!<br /><br />End Spoiler<br /><br />I found the characters lacking.  I didn't connect with Gabriel.  I felt sorry for him for the loss of his parents but he just didn't have verve.  I felt he needed a swift kick in the butt.  His social life was like that of a hermit - he had few childhood memories, no outside friends other than Uncle Mike, and just seemed to be a hunky wet blanket.  Laura was more likeable, but I found myself shaking my head at her.  She foresees Gabriel with his hands around her neck killing her and she does nothing?  Um, I think most people would get the heck away from him - love or no love.  Nope, she's determined to stick it out.  That left me wondering about her mental stability.<br /><br />Overall REUNION was enjoyable but not high on my list of great books.  In fact, I finished this book three weeks ago and have just now gotten around to writing a review - that's very unlike me!  So my final prediction:  I preferred other Sala books to this one but it is better than some of the garbage on the market.  How's that for waffling?!

Written from the aspect of the main character, Tyree recounts a creepy tale of murder, torture and mayhem.<br /><br />The book focuses on Mr. John Overby who thinks the end of the world is near.  He tells his story in an interesting, if not weird, manner.  Jumping from subject to subject, the reader only comes out of the imposed fog near the end when you get a real feel for the true meaning of Overby's life.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I should focus on Tyree's writing or his character... maybe both is in order.<br /><br />Overby tells us about his downfall in society.  We learn that his friend, Walter, is actually a serial killer and Overby becomes his partner.  We learn the vivid details about the deaths of the victims, about their torture, rape, and death.  Often times the details are so disturbing, I had to walk away from the story for a few minutes.  It was like reading Jeffrey Dahmer's diary or Ted Bundy's journal.  Overby felt as if he was doing nothing wrong, so the grotesque facts were told in what would be a monotone if actually spoken.  His mind randomly jumps from one thought to another to give the reader an insight into his psyche, but that's part of the intrigue.  The ending, even though somewhat predictable, still leaves the reader shook up.<br /><br />Tyree is right up there with Stephen King and Dean Koontz with this weird tale.  With a main character (Overby) and one sub-character (Walter), there are no distractions and Tyree goes right for the jugular.  The norm is turned upside down and the reader is tossed into a world that is uncomfortable and uncommon - at least I hope it's uncommon.  This was something I could not have read in one sitting because it gave me chills.  Yes, it disturbed me to the point I had to put it down.  Tyree volleys question after question at you and expounds on the atrocities overlooked by society.  He answers his own questions, even though you don't want to hear those responses.  I can easily see this as an episode of The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />On the down side, a few errors did occur - grammar and typos mainly - but so few it did not detour from the storyline.<br /><br />Violent and graphic to the point of making one anxious while reading, Mr. Overby is Falling is one book that will keep you awake.  Luckily it's only 79 pages long, so you can finish reading it long before dark!  My suggestion is to start reading in the morning with your first cup of coffee.  Then possibly by bedtime you will have recovered enough to sleep without nightmares.  Did I like it?  Um, I'm not sure.  I'm too uncomfortable to relax enough for that emotion, but I'd definitely recommend it!gh you don't want to hear those responses.

Kelsey has some very interesting insights into country life.  I admit that I wanted to read this book just because of the title - there are times I feel like a bitch unleashed myself and felt I could relate.  Unbeknownst to me, this book made my day as I laughed through the pages.<br /><br />Kelsey tells it like it is, or at least as it happened to her.  No one is immune to her wicked wit or is safe from the telling of just how stupid the people of Bison Flat appear.  From tales of everyday life, to stories of bat infestation, this is definitely a book that entertains.  Ok, so maybe it shouldn't be entertaining to laugh at other people's idiotic remarks or escapades, but I must be blessed with the same warped sense of humor that Nola Kelsey embraces.<br /><br />Bitch Unleashed focuses on the normal everyday events that take place in country settings that most city dwellers would find unusual.  Events such as bats finding hiding places in your closet or stove; bulls charging as you use the outhouse; goat mischief; chicken coop mishaps, etc.  The recounting of these tails is short and to the point, even if that point is with a very dry humor.<br /><br />One of my favorites was the story of Old Floyd - what a riot!  I only wished Kelsey had delved into that story more and given us more Old Floyd fodder.  We were given a glimpse of his character as she tells of how he pulled the wool over her eyes when selling her his house.  Yes, Old Floyd could have had an entire book dedicated to him!<br /><br />Another favorite was the country linguistics.  Oh my!  Definitions of \\"pert near\\", and \\"a doin's\\" was absolutely priceless when used in context.  I laughed until I cried!<br /><br />But what Nola Kelsey does best is relate a story and toss in a bit of humor along the way.  The part about prairie dogs being responsible for a finger in a fast-food chain's chili was priceless!  And I could envision tourists feeding buffalo Oreo cookies!<br /><br />On the downside, there are numerous editing errors, including spelling and grammar mistakes, along with word choice slips (such as \\"residence\\" instead of \\"residents\\").  If the editing had been done properly, this book would have been \\"pert near\\" perfect!<br /><br />Bitch Unleashed is a fast read with short chapters and not much cerebral impact.  What you get is a quick chuckle followed by a burst of gaffawing.  And the ending... well the CRAP list is amazing (Currently Recognized As Pissed).  Even though unnecessary (we guessed who'd make that list) it was a fun reminder as to the characters depicted in this book.<br /><br />If you have a sense of humor and don't mind strong language at times, then this book will be very entertaining.  For those straight-laced people who prefer a normal sense of humor, you may want to find a different book depicting country life.downside, there are numerous editing errors, including spelling and grammar mistakes, along with word choice slips (such as \\"residence\\" instead of \\"residents\\").

When I received a copy of Merle Savage's book, Silence in the Sound the Adventure, I wasn't sure what to expect. Reading the introduction, I was intrigued with the premise of learning more about the Exxon Valdez oil cleanup and was anxious to begin. Unfortunately, that excitement soon evaporated, unlike the oil from the spill.<br /><br />Savage missed the boat with this story and could have used a professional to help keep her thoughts on a steady course. Instead we're given a jerky storyline, which bounces from the clean-up procedures to her account of life in the Sound during those four months, she even throws a bit of a mystery in the mix. The things I found interesting were glossed over, but the items I didn't find interesting were given too much detail. For example, Seal Island was to be cleaned first because a few weeks later the pregnant seals would return to birth their pups. I related to the sense of urgency. But then after a short period of time, little oil had been retrieved, and an absorbent peat was used. This peat was tossed out on the water, absorbed the oil and sank to the bottom of the Sound where it remained. That was their idea of cleaning up - the oil wasn't removed just sank to the bottom. More information should have been given, but instead this procedure was glossed over and the outrage I felt smoldered.<br /><br />It may have been my feelings of discontent that left me disliking the rest of the book; or it could have been the way Savage wrote the story. She missed important details and assumed they were minor events. Events such as the absorbent peat, a 13-day delay before they could begin the clean up, wrong information deliberately being reported to the Coast Guard, etc. were merely mentioned. Yet more detail was given to her personal woes and imagined dilemmas, such as assuming everyone wanted to have sex with her. She even told a supervisor that she would not be anyone's sex toy before he said a word to her. She constantly thought supervisors would want sex from her in return for a \\"soft job\\" assignment. She didn't wait until approached, but was always on the defensive. I understand that a few were partaking in this sort of behavior, but her assumption that it involved everyone didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was that she seemed to always be looking for a conspiracy with supervisors. She would blow things out of proportion and seemed to have an inflated ego about her role. She even stated \\"transfer me to my new position officially and then I could operate without him\\" when talking about a supervisor. Her writing led the reader to believe she thought she could change everything and make things more efficient - it was always better her way and she seldom listened to others even though she had no prior experience with oil recovery and cleanup work.<br /><br />Savage was promoted to a supervisory position because of her interactions with the main people on board the ships, yet she denounced others for trying to get promoted by means other than their workmanship. Once in supervisory roles, she used that influence to special order Coca-Cola, to take a trip to see a Salmon Run or a helicopter ride to see a glacier (without telling her supervisor what she was doing). Even though she writes to try to show her being the victim of sexual harassment, I found her to be rude and offensive. When the average worker would try to approach her she would blow them off. She talked about friends, but usually ate alone and spent nights alone in her room watching movies. To her everyone had an ulterior motive.<br /><br />Word choice was often redundant, poor at times. Instead of a journal this was written more like a formal report. Quoted remarks did not come off as actual quotes - people don't speak without conjunctions and are not that proper. A good editor is definitely needed, as there are numerous spelling errors, typos, punctuation errors and wavering between past and present verb tense.<br /><br />What made me dislike this book the most was Merle Savage's declaration that people were being rewarded with \\"high wages\\" and that was the main concern, not to help with making things right again. In fact, she didn't want this project to end. For those that live in this area, to have a disaster happen in their own backyard, was unthinkable, but to profit from it? To me, this attitude is WRONG. This was a horrible tragedy and her attitude about the wages they were making cleaning up the oil spill, the power given to some people, and how they all benefited was unacceptable in my opinion. Besides that, she goes into detail about several co-workers and divulges their personal information, e.g. spouses having affairs, them having affairs, drug use, etc. That's not information most would want made public, yet she claims to be a friend to some of them. She portrayed herself above the rest, yet the reader can see through this facade.<br /><br />The ending left me astonished. The beaches were worked for 4 months with little result. The oil was left for the \\"natural washing of the tide\\" to clean the rest. \\"One day the Sound will recover\\" an Exxon representative remarked. \\"We had to make an attempt to recover or the public would have had our necks... We knew it would cost a lot of money and would be only a big show.\\" That should have been the theme of this book, not one lady's ideas that she was perceived as a sex object above all else.<br /><br />Savage missed the mark with this one. Instead of focusing on sexual innuendos, supposed harassment, and being in everyone's personal business, she should have stuck with the facts surrounding the issues in cleaning the oil - that would have made for a much more interesting story!esent verb tense.  <br /> <br />What made me dislike this book the most was Merle Savage's declaration that people were being rewarded with \\"high wages\\" and that was the main concern, not to help with making things right again.

We were on a long driving trip and I told her to read out loud figuring it would be better than surfing the radio for a decent station.  It soon became very interesting and the radio was forgotten.<br /><br />LIFE IN A CALIFORNIA MISSION is divided into two sections.  The first is a very long introduction written by Malcolm Margolin (about 50 pages).  Margolin discusses what it was like for the California Indians.<br /><br />The second part of the book was my favorite.  This is ten days worth of journal accounts of what everyday life for California Indians entailed.  In 1786 two French ships arrived.  On one of those ships was Jean Francois de la Perouse who wrote these journals.<br /><br />Perouse describes how the padres of the missions used the Indians for all labor.  The men did physical labor, while the women spent most of the day processing grain (maize) for their food.  Women were also responsible for cleaning.  Even in 1786 there were monetary caste systems in place.  The wealthier Indians wore otter skins for clothing, while the poorer people wore cloth.  The interesting thing was there was no animosity from the poorer Indians, as they were treated fairly by their own tribe.  The problems came when the padres and soldiers treated them differently.<br /><br />Perouse goes into detail as to punishment of the Indians.  If one disobeyed the padre he or she was either put in stocks, manacles or whipped, depending on the severity of his crime in the padre's estimation.  Also, the Indians were expected to become Christians and denounce their own beliefs.  If this did not happen, they were severely punished.<br /><br />Throughout the journals Perouse compared California and it's inhabitants to Chile.  Interestingly, he was very prejudiced against California and it was very obvious in his writings.<br /><br />Many facts were discovered in these pages that I had not heard of before.  Facts such as how the padres kept the Indians under such tight control.  They would lock up the daughters at night saying it was for their own protection, all the while knowing that the families would not leave their children.  The treatment of the Indians by the Spanish soldiers was atrocious and included raping the women and children, and beating the men who tried to intervene.  Diseases were also discussed.  Before the Spanish soldiers and other explorers arrived, there were very few diseases in California.  After their arrival, many new illnesses appeared, with small pox being prevalent.  Small pox was spread so easily - through the trade of skins and other items - the small pox germs contaminated anything touched by the infected person, and those that came into contact with that item became infected.<br /><br />The main thing I realized was how depressed the Indians became.  They were basically slaves and had no recourse.  They had welcomed the settlers to their land and then were treated so horribly.  I personally didn't realize how the padres of the California Missions treated these people; I had thought they were peaceful, well-meaning men who helped not hurt the people under their protection.  Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />On a side note, Perouse also describes the land and wildlife of California in 1786.  You can imagine the abundance of wildlife when he talks of sending 30,000 otter pelts to Europe.  Wow!<br /><br />Overall this book is incredible!  What started off as a reading assignment soon became intriguing. You really get a first hand account of what life was like in California during the 18th century, and what the Indians endured.

Sharon Sala is one of my favorite authors, but if I had read this book first, it may have been a different story.  FOR HER EYES ONLY is mediocre and the ending is not really an ending - Sala left a few loose ends and important ones too!<br /><br />Going on the premise that a head injury could cause psychic abilities, Sala weaves a story around Jessica Hanson.  Jessica has just returned to her small hometown after a two-year self-imposed hiatus.  Stone Richardson, the love of her life, had told her he didn't want to marry again after his disastrous first marriage due to his career choice as a police officer.  So instead of trying to change his mind, Jessica hit the road.  Now she's back and thinks he's out of her system.<br /><br />While Jessica is at work in her office, there is an electrical blackout.  Trying to fine her way in the dark, she trips and whacks her head on the file cabinets, knocking her unconscious.  While incapacitated, she sees the mayor, Olivia Stuart, murdered.  Jessica comes to at the local hospital and is confused as to exactly what is going on.  When she realizes that Olivia was murdered in her own home and not in Jessica's office, she wonders if what she saw was true or her imagination.<br /><br />While being wheeled into the emergency room on a gurney, she just happens to pass Stone.  He sees her bloody clothing, the old feelings come right back, and he inserts himself back into Jessica's life.<br /><br />Jessica and Stone are thrown together over the murder and his desire to protect her.  Ok, so that's not his only desire, but this is a romance book!  Sala has some hot and steamy sex scenes to add some spice to the storyline.  But it seems that she waffles between romance and mystery, which leaves the reader a bit confused.  SPOILER There were some decent red herrings tossed in as to who committed the murder and why, but they are left unanswered.  The reader is left dangling and we never know who committed the murder.  The book ends with the marriage of Jessica and Stone.  I wanna know who dun it!End Spoiler<br /><br />The climax seems to take a twist and instead of focusing on the murder of Olivia Stuart, Sala switches gears and instead focuses on Jessica predicting Stone being shot.  During a bank holdup and subsequent hostage situation, Jessica once again whacks her head and no longer has psychic abilities.  Interesting - if ya want to see the future, whack your head.  When it becomes a hassle, whack your head again.  Nope, I didn't buy this part and it left me groaning!<br /><br />The ending needed about 50 or so more pages to tie up the loose ends that are left floating in the wind.  Otherwise the story line was decent, but not spectacular.<br /><br />Character development was very good, as is normal Sala style.  We're given such vivid descriptions we can envision the small bald spot on Jessica's head where the doctors shaved her hair to stitch her up.  Stone is also well developed and Sala leaves nothing to the reader's imagination.  Supporting cast was a bit under developed.  Brenda, Jessica's sister, could have been much more intriguing and interesting if we understood what made her tick instead of just having her show up in Jessica's life.  Stryker, Stone's partner, was also under developed and could have added to the story.<br /><br />Overall, this was a decent book.  It's a Harlequin Romance and a quick read.  If it had more meat, then I think Sala could have finished the entire story instead of just part of it.

RPGs (Role Playing Games) became popular with Dungeons and Dragons, and there have been many offshoots since.  I'm not an RPG player, so at times this book was a bit hard to follow.  Usually Erica Spindler's books are difficult for me to put down, but it took me over a week to read this one (very usual for me!) and I'm sure it was because of the RPG theme - I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />Stacy Killian is a graduate student in New Orleans, who retired from the Dallas Police Department (this story was covered in SEE JANE DIE, Spindler's previous book).  Stacy left Dallas to start her life over, but it seems that the cop's instincts just won't stay hidden.<br /><br />When Stacy's neighbor is murdered, she just can't let it go.  She runs into a brick wall named Spencer Malone, a NOPD detective who's rough around the edges.  Malone has a lot to prove - his aunt is his commanding officer, he got his promotion to detective so he wouldn't sue the police department, and he's just cranky.  Some of his past life events are not explored in depth and the reader is left wondering what exactly is going on in Spencer's life and why.  Things are eluded to, but not delved into so we completely understand.<br /><br />Spencer Malone is not happy with Stacy's interference but let's her continue sticking her nose into his investigation.  Maybe it's the romantic sparks, which they don't act on until the very end.  Maybe he just thinks if he ignores her, she'll go away.  Not sure why this happened the way it did, but again, it's something with which Spindler doesn't enlighten us.<br /><br />Stacy is convinced that her friend's death is related to a RPG called White Rabbit, a take off of Alice in Wonderland that is dark and violent.  She begins to check things out and continues to bump into Spencer.  When she meets the game's designer, Leo Nobel, Stacy is instantly taken into his confidence.  Seems people who are close to Leo are being killed, and Stacy is sure the game is the reason.<br /><br />For avid mystery readers, the villain is no surprise.  What was a surprise for me was the number of red herrings Spindler tossed out in the last 50 or so pages.  It became absurd.  I had it figured out from the beginning.  The accomplices were somewhat of a surprise though but not a big enough surprise to make me really love this book.<br /><br />Character descriptions are at times very in-depth and at other times glossed over.  It's not uniform at all, especially with support characters that later become very important to the story.  The plot relies too much on the RPG and it is assumed that everyone understands how RPGs work.  I don't - I've never played one nor had one explained to me.  So I was left in the dark on many things in this storyline and couldn't figure out exactly what was happening at times.<br /><br />Overall KILLER TAKES ALL was a fair book, average really.  I'd recommend it to those who understand RPGs and to others when your Must Read list has dwindled.ce.

Charmed is Nora Roberts' third book in the Donovan series, which focuses on a family of witches. Captivated led the series off and featured Morgana. Next came Entranced which introduced us to Sebastian, cousin to Morgana. Charmed features Anastasia, yet another cousin to both Sebastian and Morgana. If you read the series, you'll get the entire family breakdown including the cousin's parents, an eccentric bunch to say the least!<br /><br />Each of the cousins are hereditary witches (born with elfin blood) and each have their own gift or special powers. Anastasia has the powers of healing. I have to admit my ignorance in knowing exactly what \\"powers of healing\\" entailed or meant, but now have a much better idea after finishing the book. While reading the first two books in this series, Anastasia was always growing herbs so I did know that herbal remedies played a part in her powers. What I didn't know was the depth of this power.<br /><br />Anastasia has new neighbors move in next door to her Monterey beach house and soon meets a young girl who instantly wins her love and affection. Jessie is adorable, innocent and very social as she bounds through the hedge separating the two homes and introduces not only herself to Anastasia but also her new puppy. Jessie's father, Boone Sawyer, soon comes to retrieve his daughter and meets Anastasia.<br /><br />This is your typical romance plot line but with a twist. Man meets woman, sparks fly, attraction becomes love and then ... The \\"and then\\" portion of this book is what sets it apart from other romance books. When Boone asks Anastasia to marry him, she asks for a week to make the decision. She has to try to figure out how she can tell him that she's a witch and not lose him. The decision is taken out of her hands when Jessie falls off of a ladder and is critically injured. Anastasia puts her powers to work to save the girl's life and Boone is caught off-guard and mesmerized by the special gift bestowed on Anastasia, even though he doesn't really understand what is happening. When Jessie is saved and Anastasia exhaustedly falls into an unconscious state, Boone doesn't know how to react. When Anastasia awakens, Boone doesn't handle the situation well and pushes her away. I won't tell you any more or the ending will be spoiled and this conclusion is definitely worth reading.<br /><br />Charmed isn't for someone looking for a book that will make the brain work overtime, it's pure enjoyment and entertainment value only. It's a very quick read and can be accomplished in an afternoon.<br /><br />If you'd like to take a break from the active world, sit back, relax and enjoy a tale, this would be a great book to spend the afternoon curled up on the couch with in front of a fire in the fireplace.though he doesn't really understand what is happening.

Nora Roberts does well to keep things moving along without overloading us on the hauntings, thus creating an enjoyable story.<br /><br />Roberts lays the groundwork for this novel beginning with a scene from 1899.  Abigail is awaiting the arrival of her husband, Lucien, in their home, Manet Hall.  Abigail was a lowly servant who fell madly in love with one of the sons of the owner.  Lucien reciprocates her love much to his mother's chagrin.  Instead of this being a fairy tale romance, his evil twin, Julian, intercedes.  He brutally rapes and kills Abigail. Since his mother never liked Abigail, she assists Julian in cleaning up the murder scene and helps him dump her body into the bayou so as not to be found.  They concoct a story of her running off with a lover, which breaks Lucien's heart.<br /><br />Switch back to current times and we find Declan Fitzgerald buying Manet Hall, which has fallen into disrepair.  He begins restoring the old mansion and encounters the bizarre.  Things like a room on the third floor that he cannot enter because fear overwhelms him.  Or his watch which always stops at midnight, while the chimes of a non-existent grandfather clock sound.  Or a crying baby who sounds like he's on the third floor, which is vacant.<br /><br />Enter Angelina Simone (Lena), the granddaughter of Miss Odette who lives next door to Manet Hall.  Lena has always been drawn to Manet Hall ever since she was a little girl.  Of course this being a romance, Lena and Declan fall madly in love while they try to unravel the strange happenings surrounding them.<br /><br />Character development is excellent and Roberts delves into Declan and Lena with her usual style, leaving little to the imagination.  Also, we are given insight into Abigail and Lucien and we're led to believe that they could be Declan and Lena in previous lives.  Ok, so it's a bit weird, but nothing is out of reach when Nora Roberts is at the helm.  A support cast rounds is also well developed and intriguing in their own rights.<br /><br />Roberts doesn't overdo the hauntings or supernatural stuff to the point that it deters from the story line or characters.  If anything it enhances the reader's enjoyment.  She uses the right mix of romance and supernatural to attract a greater reading audience.<br /><br />Midnight Bayou is very different than Roberts other works, but still achieves the excellent standards we've come to expect.  It's a great book and should be added to your Must Read list.is out of reach when Nora Roberts is at the helm.

Not so with this one, it definitely fell on the very good side of reading material.<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a part time lifeguard, pool cleaner/ gopher for a wealthy man in Palm Beach, Sollie, who just happens to be his landlord.  While on the beach, he meets Tess McAuliffe, the girl of his dreams, or so he thinks.  As he leaves her suite at a local ritzy hotel, he vows his life will change upon his return.  Little does he know that the change will not be for the good.<br /><br />Seems Ned and his childhood buddies plan an art heist that pays a million dollars each.  Easy stuff, just break in and take three paintings.  Ned's job is to rush around Palm Beach setting off alarms so the cops are running around chasing false alarms while the real burglary is going on.  All goes well until upon entering the house they realize the paintings aren't there - they've been double crossed by someone else.  By the time Ned gets back to the house, all of his friends have been executed.  He has a bad feeling, so he goes to see Tess and she also has been killed.  Ned takes off to try to save himself while trying to find their killer(s).  Hot on Ned's trail is an FBI agent, Ellie Shurtleff, who specializes in stolen art.  She's cute, spunky and definitely overlooked as an agent.<br /><br />In a bizarre turn of events, Ned takes Ellie hostage.  He explains that he didn't commit the killings or the art theft, and she believes him.  A bit far-fetched, but hey, anything can happen in Patterson's world!  Ellie is released and she begins her crusade to get the FBI to find the real killer and leave poor Ned alone.  Hmmm...<br /><br />The characters are very well developed and we have a wide assortment to enjoy.  Ned is the Bostonian transplanted to Florida where he enjoys menial jobs, while longing for a life of something different.  Ellie is the underestimated agent who shows more gumption than her colleagues by doing her own investigations into the crimes.  Sollie, a rich old man, who had hired Ned to take care of his pool and play gin with him, is eccentric and lovable.  Champ is one of my favorites.  The orange-haired has-been motorcycle-racing champion is loyal to his friends.  He's up for anything that is a challenge (jumping his motorcycle over the bridge as it was rising was just another day in his life), and he's the \\"cup is half full\\" type.  Stratton, an egotistical jerk is so well developed that the reader actually hates the man.  Liz, Stratton's wife, is confusing, but then we figure out that was exactly the reaction Patterson wanted to achieve with her character.<br /><br />Plot development was also excellent.  There are more twists and turns in this story than in a Spirograph drawing.  You never know which way the story will take you, but my advice it to hold on and enjoy.  I had the ending partially figure out but Patterson did throw a couple of wrenches into my ideas.

When I first saw this book, it appeared to be more of a textbook or reference book rather than non-fiction reading material.  Quite large with 644 pages (including index and bibliography), it details every campaign and skirmish during this troubling time and lets the reader actually see the war from both sides of the battlefield.  It's concise, organized, and in many instances is written from a journalistic standpoint.<br /><br />Don Bracken lists each battle in a summarizing inventory.  Name of battle, other names, location, campaign, principal commanders, forces engaged, estimated casualties, and a description give in-depth detail to each.  Some contain \\"results\\" of how the battle affected the war.  The descriptions are mostly facts but a few have interesting tidbits tossed in that I found quite interesting.<br /><br />What I found most fascinating were the journal/diary entries giving insight as to what the soldiers and commanders were thinking, the conditions that they endured, and a first hand account of what was happening.  These also list the officers killed during the battles, and those wounded (specifying the wounds, e.g. \\"wounded in the abdomen\\", \\"wounded in the hand\\", etc.).  These journal entries gave a human side of the battles.  \\"It is impossible to form an accurate idea of the loss on either side, as the firing is still going on, rendering it extremely difficult to remove the killed and wounded.\\"  The descriptions of this bring images to mind that are more vivid than a faceless soldier enduring things unimaginable at times.<br /><br />Also included are excerpts from newspapers with stories of the battles.  You can see the various accounts and how slanted the reporting could be.  The Enquirer and The Whig actually thought of General Lee as \\"noble and invincible\\".  There are also various accounts from correspondents covering the war for a variety of newspapers.  These cover everything from embalming the dead to intricate details of the various battles.<br /><br />Having learned about the civil war in high school and again in college, reading TIMES OF THE CIVIL WAR, made me realize that I knew very little about that war.  I never realized what factors played a role in the battles - things like weather, timely arrival of messages from Washington and other commanders in the field, the dispatching of surgeons and medical supplies, all added to the outcome.<br /><br />There hasn't been another book written with as many facts and details about the Civil War as this book, so if you're interested in the Civil War, then this is the book for you.

Sharon Sala is fast becoming one of my favorite authors and she continued to intrigue me with DARK WATER.  I figured out the identity of the villain, well almost!  She kept that a hidden secret until the very end and I doubt many will figure it out.<br /><br />Sarah Whitman left Marmet, Maine as a broken-hearted child.  Her father, Franklin, had been accused of stealing a million dollars from the bank in which he worked and then disappeared.  Soon afterward, not able to continue enduring the ridicule of the town, her mother committed suicide.  Sarah then moves to New Orleans with her mother's best friend and she vows never to return.  Twenty years later, when an armored car is robbed, and a teller is kidnapped, the assailant decides to ditch the car and hostage in Flagstaff Lake, only to die during this escapade.  While divers try to retrieve his body, they find a chest holding the remains of Franklin Whitman.  Sarah returns to Marmet to give her father a proper burial, to find his killer, and avenge her parents' deaths.<br /><br />Tony DeMarco had come back to Marmet to lend his support to Sarah.  Seems Franklin was young Tony's mentor and he feels obligated to help Sarah to pay his debt to her father.  Sounds a little convoluted, but it was actually sweet.  When he sees Sarah though, all thoughts of being a gallant gentleman escape as he falls head over heels in lust with her.  When an attempt on Sarah's life fails, Tony realizes he feels more than lust and also understands that she's upset her father's killer with her vow to uncover the real thief and murderer.<br /><br />Ok, so the love story part of this book is a bit gaggy (is that a word?), but the suspense is wonderful!  Sala continues to keep the action going and the reader guessing throughout the entire book.  I had narrowed down the villain to a handful of people, but when I tried to figure out the one person who could be behind these crimes, my guess was wrong.  I was close, but not quite close enough.  I love it when an author fools me!<br /><br />The wide assortment of characters was very interesting.  Sarah is a strong independent southern woman.  Tony is the bad boy turned successful business owner (and we're only given a few hints as to how he got the nickname of \\"Silk\\" when he was a teenager).  Lorett is Sarah's \\"Aunt\\" who raised her.  She is able to see the future and has been known to use a bit of voodoo if the mood arises.  She's wonderfully developed and always brings a smile to the reader's face whenever she enters the scene.  The rest of the support cast is also well built and interesting.  The eclectic group of older ladies who make up the town social order are all fascinating and enjoyable.  Maury, the private investigator, is rough around the edges, but loveable.  Another book could be written with any of these in the lead roles and it would be wonderful.<br /><br />The suspense portion of DARK WATER is extremely well done, but the love interests bring the book down to a 4 ½ star level.  Even so, it's one that should definitely be added to your Must Read list.nough.  I love it when an author fools me! <br /> <br />The wide assortment of characters was very interesting.

I'm really glad I didn't read this one first or I never would have picked up another book by Linda Howard!<br /><br />The loose story focuses on Rome Matthews and Sarah Harper.  Rome's wife, Diana, and his two sons are killed in a tragic auto accident leaving him a bitter man who is angry at the entire world.  Sarah was Diana's best friend but has always secretly loved Rome.  Three years after the accident, Rome decides to clean out his house and sell it (he's never been back there in all that time).  He asks Sarah to come over and get a box of photos from her and Diana's school days.  Hmmm... he's just now getting around to cleaning out the house and selling it?  He could have hired someone to do it and not deal with the painful memories that it brings.  And why wait three years?  It seemed a bit of a stretch to me!<br /><br />When Sarah gets to the house, they end up kissing and almost having sex.  He realizes what he's doing and stops, making a horrible remark to Sarah. Seems Rome likes to be a nasty human being, as we see throughout the book.<br /><br />The next thing the reader knows Rome is proposing to Sarah so she won't just be his mistress.  Huh?  Ok, this was written in 1985, but that type of thinking went out years before that!  The marriage is one of convenience and Sarah is hoping Rome falls in love with her.  But with the marriage came the stipulation that she never gets pregnant.  With the title, everyone knows this is going to happen.<br /><br />The storyline was horrible.  The only thing filling 250 pages is sex scenes (and not very well done ones either).  Rome is rude, obnoxious, and just a complete ass.  Sarah is a wimp and never says a word to him, just endures his attitude and allows him to use her.  She suffers in silence and never says anything to him when he's detestable.  Give me a break!  There are no surprises; there is no depth to this story.<br /><br />Character development was a joke.  Rome and Sarah are fairly well developed but there are huge holes in their characters.  We are never told of their extended families.  A mere mention of Sarah's parents, but that is all.  Marcy, Derek and Max could have given so much more vigor to this story if only we could have more information about them.  And Max's attraction to Sarah could have been so much more developed, to the point that we actually have an interesting story.  But again this falls short and we're left wondering why we're only being given glimpses of these people who are so important in the lives of Rome and Sarah.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'd say pass this one up, especially if you've never read anything by Linda Howard.  Her talent is just not showing through with SARAH'S CHILD.  I struggled to finish this book, which is quite unusual for me.  And I'm glad I finished it and can move on to something interesting to read!y. <br /> <br />Character development was a joke.

US	51874804	RF3UIG1BEYP83	0553576054	445871149	The Rana Look	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The Frump and the Hunk	THE RANA LOOK is a typical romance but with a few flourishes that make it interesting.  Since this was originally written in 2002, it's fairly up to date on male/female attitudes.  However, a few of the football references led me to believe it was written in the early 80's (like the greatest quarterbacks being Staubach or Namath).  If you can get past those, then it's enjoyable.<br /><br />Rana Ramsey is in hiding.  She walked away from being a supermodel and is living in a Galveston, Texas boarding house.  She covers her spectacular green eyes with blue-tinted glasses; she hides her incredible figure with baggy clothes; and she lets her auburn hair hang in her face, instead of styling it.  All of this done in the hopes no one will recognize her and blow her self-imposed exile; expose her so she would have to return to her overbearing mother and a life in which she is miserable.<br /><br />Miss Ruby, who doesn't pry into Rana's life, owns the boarding house and all is well until she gets a new boarder.  Miss Ruby's nephew, Trent Gamblin, a star professional quarterback, moves in for a few weeks to try to get his injured shoulder to heal before summer training camp.  Trent begins his quest for the \\"Plain Jane\\" and the chase is on.<br /><br />The typical part is the story line.  Trent is determined to win over Rana.  Rana is determined to stay away from Trent.  Sparks fly.  Passion ensues.  Both fall madly in love.  Only then does Rana realize that she needs to tell Trent of her real identity before they can have any kind of future together.<br /><br />The climax happens at a football party, in which Rana enters in full fashion show attire - sexy gown, make up/hair done to perfection.  When Trent finally realizes that she's Rana, he becomes angry at her deception.  Huh?  I really don't think most men would be angry if their lover turned out to be a drop-dead gorgeous model.  He runs outside, she follows, they fight, and then make up and everyone lives happily ever after.  Talk about anticlimactic!<br /><br />A few scenes helped make this a more interesting story than just a typical romance.  The overbearing mother was developed to the point that the reader just wanted to slap her each time she opened her mouth.  To realize that there are mothers out there who resemble Susan Ramsey makes one sick.  On the other hand, Miss Ruby was enlightening and her witty comebacks were very enjoyable.<br /><br />The let downs were when subplots weren't fully developed.  The entire greenhouse thing was a disappointment.  Trent and Rana almost got hot and heavy in there, and that was the extent of it, yet several pages were devoted to Miss Ruby and her greenhouse.  Miss Ruby's romantic night away could have been much more fun if detail were given instead of a mention that the friend she spent the night with wasn't a female.  What?  How come we don't even know if the guy was tall/short, fat/thin, a business man or retired?  It could have been so much more...<br /><br />Overall, THE RANA LOOK was a decent romance.  It's a quick read (256 pages) and not something that will make your brain ache from trying to figure things out.  It's a good book for those days when life has stressed you out and you need a quick escape.y ever after.

It lacked her normal suspenseful plot twists and action brought forth in other books.  It wasn't boring but it just wasn't the type of book to keep me up late at night.  It put me to sleep instead.<br /><br />The story focuses on Nikita Stover who is an FBI agent from 200 years in the future.  She's been sent back to investigate some unauthorized time travel and is tossed into the middle of a bunch of bizarre happenings.  Nikita meets Knox Davis, chief investigator for the sheriff's department.  Knox has always been an inquisitive person, even as a child, and when things start happening that can't be answered, he is bewildered.  Once Nikita explains to him about her time traveling, he easily accepts it and together they go about solving the various crimes plaguing Pekesville.  I think he accepted it a little too easily and took everything Nikita said at face value without much questioning.  Knox wasn't portrayed as someone who just accepts things and goes on - that entire episode could have been a witty bantering session, but instead the reader was shortchanged with Knox's easy acquiescence.<br /><br />In 1985 a time capsule was buried in Pekesville.  One of the mysteries is why someone stole it, and why that someone appears on the surveillance cameras as a white blur.  Next is the murder of a local man who was at the time capsule ceremony in 1985.  Interestingly, many of those people at the ceremony have died, including the high school football coach, who just happens to have a degree from Cal Tech, and experiments with the possibilities of time travel.  Ok, anyone else find that far-fetched?  Why would anyone with a Cal Tech degree in physics work in a small town in Kentucky as a football coach?  I had to reread that paragraph twice before I realized I didn't misunderstand.  Yep, a Cal Tech grad as a smalltime football coach... who would think that?<br /><br />The character development was hugely lacking.  Knox and Nikita were both fairly well developed, but the support cast was horribly underdeveloped.  The agents sent back in time to track down Nikita were never introduced in depth so the reader could get to know them.  The same is true with Knox's father and stepmother - a few generalized statements about them was all.  All of the characters other than Knox and Nikita were only given a superficial introduction at best.  I felt like I was in a group of strangers!<br /><br />This is predictable to the point that there were absolutely no surprises in KILLING TIME.  The anticlimactic ending was so bad that I felt cheated!  There was no great showdown, only a mild scene that was so bland it could have been penned by a twelve year old with little imagination.  Linda Howard is wonderful at plot twists to keep the reader guessing and the endings are usually full of revelations that the reader doesn't consider.  Not so in this one.  It makes me wonder if Linda Howard actually wrote this book!<br /><br />I'd still recommend this book, but be warned that it is average and not up to the normal standards expected from Linda Howard.  Read MR. PERFECT, KILL AND TELL, or NOW YOU SEE HER to get the real understanding of Howard's works.development was hugely lacking.

When she adds suspense, a bit of romance, and plot twists that leave the reader breathless, you can bet this is a bestseller.<br /><br />Milla Boone and David, her physician husband, are in Mexico helping those that can't afford medical care.  You'd think the village people would protect them, however, that's not the case.  While Milla is at an open-air market buying fresh vegetables, Justin, her 6-week-old son, is stolen from her arms.  During the attack, Milla is almost killed, yet she is able to permanently scars one of her attackers.<br /><br />Afterward, she and her husband try everything to find their child to no avail.  Milla returns to the US and establishes Finders, an organization that helps search for missing children.  Her network is nationwide, and amazing.  When they get a call that a child is missing, she begins the search.  This can be anything from walking the neighborhood on foot, searching wild terrain, to helping track down kidnappers.  Ten years later, her success rate is high, but she still has no idea about her own child.  She has driven everyone close away, including her husband and family.<br /><br />Enter Diaz, a mysterious man who specializes in finding people.  A bounty hunter type, he agrees to help Milla.  Within a few weeks, she has hope of finding her child; more hope than she's had in a very long time.  The only problem is the closer she seems to get to the answers she's searched for, the more danger is involved.  Soon, Milla uncovers truths that reveal betrayal.<br /><br /> These characters are strong and vibrant.  I cried with Milla throughout this book.  I could feel the machismo of Diaz.  I enjoyed the sparks between the two and the chemistry was palpable.  True Gallagher, who tries everything in his power, to become Milla's lover, is also well developed.  He's the direct opposite of Diaz. Diaz is willing to get in the middle of things to help, whereas Gallagher would rather write a check and have someone else do the work.  It's very entertaining to read about these two fighting over Milla's attention.  Milla's friends, Rip and Susanna, are both well developed and keep us amused.  I enjoyed reading about their dinners and lunches with Milla and you could tell how much they cared about her.<br /><br />While some of the storyline is predictable and you can see the turns coming, Howard throws a few surprises our way.  I do have to say that the ending was an amazing twist that I didn't expect.  All I can say without giving it away is WOW.  I found myself cheering for the suitor of my choice to win Milla's heart.  I found myself breathless as Milla and Diaz chase the bad guys for answers as to Justin's whereabouts.

While I enjoy her mystery books better, SUNNY CHANDLER'S RETURN was a fun, quick read.<br /><br />Three years ago, Sunny Chandler vowed to never return to the small town in which she grew up.  Seems she wouldn't tell anyone why she left her bridegroom standing at the alter - not her parents, not her best friend/maid of honor, no one knew the reason.  When the minister asked if she would take him as her husband, she replied, \\"No I'd rather not,\\" Turned and walked down the aisle.  But when her best friend begs her to return to Latham Green for her wedding, she can't refuse.<br /><br />At the pre-wedding dinner party a week before the nuptials, Sunny is trying to blend into the woodwork, but is noticed by Ty Beaumont, sheriff of Latham Green.  He's smitten from the first moment but Sunny is not about to give in to his charm.  So begins his courtship - working her up into a frenzy only to leave her alone to think about his allure.  This goes on for a week, until he finally gets not only her heart but also the truth about what happened on her wedding day to cause her to flee the town.<br /><br />Character development was fair.  Sunny and Ty were both fully developed and interesting, even though predictable.  The support cast was underdeveloped and left the reader wondering why they were involved in the story if we were only given glimpses of them.<br /><br />The story line was of the romantic cookie-cutter variety:  man meets woman, sparks fly, woman deflects man's attempts to lure her into bed, woman submits, both fall hopelessly in love, all live happily ever after.  Sandra Brown's humor shows through a little bit, which livens things.  One hilarious scene is where Sunny is scared by a prowler and calls the sheriff to come to her rescue, only to find out that the \\"prowler\\" was not the murdering thug she imagined, but a family of marauding raccoons.<br /><br />Even though the story was predictable and the plot has been overdone by every romance author on the face of the earth, SUNNY CHANDLER'S RETURN had moments that made it a bit better than average.  The kicking down of the front door shows the macho aspect expected in this kind of book but the marauding raccoons showed a humorous side that was unique.<br /><br />If you want to read something to kick your brain into gear, this is not the book for you.

When reading a Gerritsen novel, the reader should expect the unexpected.  Even so, there are times when I'm still taken by surprise but not so much with BODY DOUBLE, as it was predictable for the most part.<br /><br />We've seen Dr. Maura Isles in previous books.  Isles had been dubbed the \\"Doctor of the Dead\\" by the press - she's a medical examiner who is often called out on cases worked by homicide detective Jane Rizzoli.  Rizzoli is now eight months pregnant yet still working.  The unusual friendship between the two is one of the unexpected quirks that readers enjoyed in Gerritsen's previous work.<br /><br />When Rizzoli is called out to a murder scene, she believes the corpse is her good friend Dr. Isles.  When Dr. Isles shows up to the scene, which happens to be in front of her home, only then does everyone realize that the adopted Dr. Isle had an identical twin sister.  No one knows anything about this woman until a detective from a neighboring town, Rick Ballard, comes in to identify the body.  Now begins the weaving of the various plots.<br /><br />Seems Anna, Maura's twin, was on the trail of finding the identity of their parents.  Amalthea Lank is in prison for murder and believed to be their mother.  Lank was convicted of murdering two sisters, one of them nine months pregnant.  As the story unfolds, Lank and her accomplice kills expectant mothers, stole their babies, and sold them for adoption.  It was a money making racket and one that's hard to trace.  Now Rizzoli must find the accomplice before he comes to kill Maura like he did Anna.<br /><br />Characterization was a bit off in this book, as the characters weren't as vibrant as I've seen in previous works.  Even with the reemergence of some of my favorites from previous books, the new people are blah.  Amalthea is not developed to the point that the reader is disgusted by her evilness.  Rick Ballard, though described as handsome, didn't leave me cheering for him when he was becoming emotionally involved with Maura and trying to break through the walls she's constructed around her heart.  Pregnant Mattie Purvis is the latest victim of Amalthea's accomplice.  She is kidnapped and placed in a buried wooden box, and was more vivid even though she was given less pages of storyline than the others.  These new characters just fell short of drawing the reader into their world, with the exception of Mattie.<br /><br />Overall, BODY DOUBLE was enjoyable, but not a cliffhanger like THE SURGEON or THE APPRENTICE.  Ms. Gerritsen did leave it wide open for her next book in which we'll see Jane Rizzoli as a mother, Dr. Isles continuing on alone as she has in the past, and Frost (Jane's partner) continuing on as a solid stand-up guy.  Hopefully the villains and support cast will have more life in the next book.hough described as handsome, didn't leave me cheering for him when he was becoming emotionally involved with Maura and trying to break through the walls she's constructed around her heart.

Her characters are brilliant along with story lines that are excellent and intriguing.  If she continues in this fashion, she may have found a new niche in her writing world.<br /><br />Theo Buchanan has a knack for making a first impression and he does so with Dr. Michelle \\"Mike\\" Renard.  He's at a party in New Orleans and tosses his cookies all over her new expensive dress, which she has had second thoughts about being so frivolous in buying.  She soon realizes that Theo is in trouble and rushes him to the hospital to perform an emergency appendectomy and saves his life.<br /><br />After he returns to Boston and continues his role as a federal prosecutor, Theo can't stop thinking about the adorable Mike.  Upon concluding a highly visible case in which many big shots in an organized crime group are brought to justice, Theo begins to get death threats.  His boss suggests that it's time for a vacation and Theo is quickly on his way back to Bowen, Louisiana, which just happens to be where Mike is setting up her new medical practice.  Ok, so the coincidence is a bit much, but just read past that part because it does get much better!<br /><br />As Theo enters town, he's mistaken for the new coach of the high school football team.  Comedy abounds as every player and those wanting to play drop by to meet the new coach.  Gardener shows her wit in these scenes as Theo continues to try to convince everyone that he's not the coach... when the reader least expects it, someone comes along calling Theo \\"coach\\".  It's just the right amount of humor to break up the suspense!<br /><br />It seems as if Mike is the target of someone with a grudge.  Her new office is broken into and she's being followed.  Theo comes to the rescue to uncover the Sowing Club, a group of embezzlers who stray to a different type of crime when they perform a mercy killing on one of their member's terminally ill wife, who just happens to have been Mike's cousin.<br /><br />Character development is wild.  Mike is wonderfully dynamic - she's been raised by her father along with brothers determined that she not be a frilly girl.  Her family is colorful, often popping into the bar owned by her father.  The townsfolk are a wide variety that keeps the story interesting.  But John Paul has to be one of my favorite characters - he's Mike's brother, who marches to his own beat and doesn't care what anyone thinks.<br /><br />Not having read a romance by Julie Garwood, I can't compare this to her earlier work.  However, I am thrilled that she has switched genres because she is excellent with her romantic suspense books - they keep you reading well past your bedtime!lling on one of their member's terminally ill wife, who just happens to have been Mike's cousin. <br /> <br />Character development is wild.

In THE WEDDING NIGHT OF AN ENGLISH ROGUE, we meet yet another Boscastle family member in Jillian Hunter's conclusion to her latest trilogy.  Heath Boscastle is every bit as much fun as Grayson and Chloe had been in the previous books, THE SEDUCTION OF AN ENGLISH SCOUNDREL and THE LOVE AFFAIR OF AN ENGLISH LORD.<br /><br />Six years after Heath Boscastle encounters Julia Hepworth, he is asked to be her bodyguard by his commanding officer, Russell Althorne.  Seems Althorne saved his life so Heath owes him a favor.  Little does Althorne know that Heath and Julia had a romantic encounter that neither has been able to forget in the ensuing years.<br /><br />Reluctantly Heath agrees and the rekindling of their romantic feelings begins.  But this is more than a typical historical romance.  Hunter likes to keep the reader guessing, so she adds a bit of suspense.  Seems Althorne is on the heels of a diabolical villain, Armond Auclair, a Frenchman who enjoys torturing his captives.  Heath had been captured by Auclair and barely survived, only to be rescued by Russell Althorne and a friend and fellow soldier, Hamm.  Althorne believes Auclair is in France, but when Julia begins to have encounters with a stranger, Heath wonders if Auclair isn't behind the meetings.<br /><br />Jillian Hunter brings back some of her characters from the two previous books, much to my happiness.  Grayson Boscastle and his lovely wife, Jane, show us that life has not changed for them.  They are still witty, fun, and very much in love.  Unfortunately we were only given a glimpse of Chloe and Dominick, but I'm hoping Hunter gives us a glimpse into their lives in the future.<br /><br />Hunter has created the Boscastles who rival Nora Roberts' MacGregor clan.  Each Boscastle is unique, but all possess the verve for life that set them apart from others.  Seldom is the reader entertained to this extent by the shenanigans of so many amusing people.  The Boscastle's knack for finding themselves in interesting but scandalous situations will leave you laughing.  One excellent example is Julia having her nude caricature of Heath stolen and then published in a pamphlet distributed all over London.  It was pure enjoyment each time someone mentioned that drawing to Heath and I loved reading about him squirming his way into an explanation that would not disgrace he or Julia.<br /><br />Jillian Hunter continues to shine with THE WEDDING NIGHT OF AN ENGLISH ROGUE.  Her humor is at the forefront and leaves the reader wanting more at the end of the book.  I hope she continues with the dramatics of this energetic family in the near future!leave you laughing.

I was hooked.  KILLJOY is the 3rd book in this series, and equally as good as the first two.<br /><br />The story revolves around Avery Delaney who is a data analyst with the FBI.  From the time Avery was a few days old, she was raised by her Grandma Lola and Aunt Carrie, as her mother, Jilly, was more interested in partying and adding another notch to her bedpost than raising a child.  They didn't hear from Jilly for five years until she returned with a boyfriend and wanted money threatening to take Avery if she didn't get what she wanted.  It didn't turn out the way Jilly planned and she left in a huff, only to return a few years later to try again.  This time things turned violent - Lola died, while Avery was almost killed.  This harrowing experience formed a special bond between Avery and her Aunt Carrie.<br /><br />Zip to current timeframe and we see Carrie in a troubled marriage with Tony.  Seems Tony likes to spend Carries money that she makes from her advertising company, yet has little emotional involvement in their relationship.  He encourages her to go on a holiday at a Colorado Spa, Utopia with Avery.  This is when the story puts you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />In typical Avery fashion, she loses track of time and misses her plane.  She arrives at the spa a day late only to find that her aunt never arrived and cancelled the reservations.  No way would that happen, so Avery is on the hunt to figure out what happened to Aunt Carrie.  She runs into John Paul Renard in the lobby of Utopia.  Seems he's looking for a hit man named Monk.  John Paul hears of Carrie's disappearance and begins to wonder if Monk is involved.<br /><br />A phone call to Avery sets them on a treasure hunt of sorts.  They have a short time to make a destination or Carrie will be killed.  As they race along, frantic that they won't make it, the reader is thrust to the hilltop home where Carrie and two other ladies are being held captive.  An interesting twist is that the house is rigged with explosives so that if they try to escape, they will be blown up.<br /><br />The story is two fold - we have John Paul and Avery racing to save Carrie and being led from destination to destination.  Meanwhile Carrie is trying to save the women in the home by figuring out how to get out.  The two plots come together nicely and the ending will surprise a few, but most will have figured out the villains.  Even so, there is enough going on to continue the suspense without the mystery involved.  The romance between John Paul and Avery is expected yet refreshing at times.  Garwood includes enough humor to keep things interesting and refreshing instead of boring and bland.<br /><br />Characters are vivid and unique.  We were given glimpses of John Paul in Garwood's two previous books, HEATBREAKER and MERCY.  Avery and Carrie are both strong women who don't dwell on past atrocities they've endured but strive to be successful, happy people.  Even Monk and his sidekick are so descriptive that I took an instant dislike to both of them.<br /><br />KILLJOY was so enjoyable that I have added all of Garwood's books to my list of Books to Read.  She's definitely one of my favorite authors.hilltop home where Carrie and two other ladies are being held captive.

Now instead of a girl, she's a young woman enrolled in the FBI Academy who's still chasing her demons.  While there, she stumbles upon a dead body while out running - yes, she actually trips over it.  The discovery shakes her when she realizes that this victim resembles her dead sister.  Another interesting tidbit is that this body was placed on the Marine Base adjacent to the Academy - most people can't get on this secured base.  As the Naval Criminal Investigation Service investigates, Kimberly can't let it go and begins her own inquiry.<br /><br />She begrudgingly teams up with Mac McCormack, a Special Agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigations.  Seems Mac has had previous experience with this killer and he wonders why the villain has started killing again after a long absence.  Kimberly takes a leave of absence from the Academy and devotes all of her time to finding out why this murder was committed, and more importantly, why the victim was placed in an obvious place for her to find.<br /><br />As Mac receives strange mail and phone messages, it's a mad dash to figure out the clues and get to the next victim before it's too late.  And always the same note is left, \\"planet dying... animals weeping... rivers screaming... can't you hear it? Heat kills\\".  The heat wave plays an important part of the murderer's motive and the clues take Mac and Kimberly all over the east coast on a wild goose chase.<br /><br />Gardner switches scenes seamlessly between Mac and Kimberly's attempt to rescue the victim, Tina Krahn, and Tina's struggle to exist long enough to be found.  This seemed to add a bit of urgency to the story, as we identify with Tina's panic and despondency.<br /><br />The characters are dramatic and the attraction between Mac and Kimberly is obvious and expected.  This magnetism adds a new dimension to the story, to keep the reader thoroughly entranced.  You'll cheer on Mac as he tries to break through Kimberly's emotional walls, while urging them to hurry and find Tina.  You'll grimace at the grotesque details, which surround Tina that only someone with a strong will to survive could endure.<br /><br />The villain is predictable to most, but it still doesn't detour from the storyline.  Instead of being exasperated with the identity, I found myself wondering how he would be exposed and was quite surprised.  And the pitfalls endured by Mac and Kimberly... well, creepy doesn't begin to describe some of them!  This is definitely not a book for the faint of heart!cheer on Mac as he tries to break through Kimberly's emotional walls, while urging them to hurry and find Tina.

IN SILENCE continues to showcase Erica Spindler's talents that keep her reading audience wanting more.  It's a book that grabs you and won't let you stop reading.  It should come with a warning:  Caution - can cause sleep loss!<br /><br />Avery Chauvin returns to her hometown of Cypress Springs, LA to bury her father, the victim of a suicide.  Avery can't believe her father would kill himself and has a very difficult time coming to terms with his death.  Upon entering the town, she is pulled over by her old high school flame, Matt Stevens, who is now the sheriff.  He welcomes her home with open arms and it's obvious he wants to rekindle their romance.  In fact, most of his family are hoping for reconciliation and make sure Avery knows she's still welcome as part of their family.<br /><br />But all is not as it should be - soon things start happening that makes Avery begin investigating and there's plenty to look into.  One thing that's apparent is Matt's twin brother, Hunter, is person non-grata in his family home and Avery is determined to figure out why.  Then there is the anonymous phone call telling Avery that her father was murdered.  Next a local woman turns up dead and another woman is in town to look into the mysterious disappearance of her brother a few months ago.  Seems several people have been known to vanish without a trace in Cypress Springs in the last few years.<br /><br />IN SILENCE is a blend of romance and suspense.  The romantic episodes are not a surprise but the rest of the book is definitely unpredictable.  Just when I thought I figured things out, something else was brought to light to make me wonder if I was correct.<br /><br />Character development was vivid.  I could see Matt sauntering like the football stud he had been in high school.  I could see the unhappiness in Hunter's eyes whenever his family shuns him.  I could feel Avery's determination to find out what happened to her father.  And as for the support cast, well some of them are so insipient that you just want to slap them; others are very likeable.<br /><br />The story itself is at times so unpredictable that you're surprised the idea hadn't occurred to you previously.  I enjoy a story that keeps me on my toes, and IN SILENCE definitely did.<br /><br />Between this book and DEAD RUN by Spindler, I am absolutely a fan.  She definitely does not disappoint the reader and you'll enjoy the stories tremendously.them are so insipient that you just want to slap them; others are very likeable. <br /> <br />The story itself is at times so unpredictable that you're surprised the idea hadn't occurred to you previously.

THE SURVIVOR'S CLUB was my introduction to Lisa Gardner, and what an explosive introduction!  It had all of the things I enjoy in a book:  thrilling story, suspense, mystery, a wide variety of characters, and a touch of romance.<br /><br />Detective Roan Griffin finds himself thrown into a new murder case on his first day back from a leave of absence following his wife's death from cancer.  He's grumpy and questioning his life choices, which adds a bit of intrigue to the story.<br /><br />Eddie Como, a serial rapist, is on trial for the crimes he swears he never committed.  While leaving the courthouse, he is the victim of a professional hit.  But moments later, the assassin becomes the victim of a car bomb.  Seems someone is being extra careful about the possibility of his/her identity coming out.<br /><br />The prime suspects in this case are three women who are happy Eddie is dead.  Jillian Hayes, who's sister Trisha was raped and died due to her allergic reaction to latex used to tie her up during her encounter.  Jillian had gone to Trisha's apartment right after the rape and was severely beaten in order for the man to escape.  Next is Carol Rosen, the wife of a successful attorney, who was raped in her home.  And lastly we have Eddie's first victim, Meg Pesaturo, a young lady who remembers nothing about her attack.  These women were having coffee a couple of blocks from the courthouse, bracing themselves for their court appearances when the killings happen.  Even though they vouch for each other, the alibis are questioned since they all are vocal about their hatred of Eddie.<br /><br />Interestingly, after Eddie is killed, another rape occurs and the doctors recover Eddie's DNA from victim.  Jillian and Roan begin their investigations as to how this could happen - Eddie is dead, how can he continue to rape?<br /><br />Characters are robust and enjoyable - Jillian matches wits against Roan until he gives in to his feelings and joins forces with her.  The romance sideline is inevitable but still fun.  Trisha and Carol are not as developed as Jillian, but still vivid characters.  My favorites are Jillian's mother Libby, who was once a singer but can no longer speak and her nurse, Toppi.  They add a twist that is highly pleasurable.<br /><br />The pace is fast and the journey is not one that can be foreseen.  Loops along the way keep it illusive until the very end.  The conclusion will leave you thinking, \\"of course it happened this way\\", and wondering why you didn't figure it out sooner.  Yet, few do figure it out before Gardner leads us there.<br /><br />Lisa Gardner brings it all together with THE SURVIVOR'S CLUB: great characters and a wonderful storyline.

Suspense seems to be Gardner's forte and this book shows why she excels.<br /><br />Melanie Stokes was adopted as a young girl into a fantasy world.  Her wealthy parents lavish her with anything she wants - a huge bedroom including a closet filled with frilly dresses, hats, gloves and every accessory you can imagine.  Her new parents, brother, and even godfather make her the center of their existence and anything she wants she gets.  The doting family is at first a nice change, but soon becomes overwhelming.  Soon Melanie can't sleep and begins to wander downstairs to stair at a painting of the Stokes' first daughter, Meagan.  The clothing and hairstyle that is being pushed on Melanie are exactly in the image of Meagan.  Also a bit on the weird side is that Meagan had been kidnapped and killed before Melanie had been adopted.  Even at her young age, Melanie realized she was supposed to replace or become Meagan in the eyes of her new family. Her Godfather, Jamie O'Donnell, finally intercedes and enables them to see Melanie as Melanie and not Meagan.<br /><br />After Melanie becomes an adult, everything she knows soon has shadows of uncertainty.  Enter FBI Agent David Riggs who helps Melanie unravel the tangle of lies to find out the truth behind her adoption and young life.  The truth plays out like an episode of Twilight Zone, but it is very entertaining and the reader will not see the twists coming.<br /><br />Character development is excellent, even with a physical abnormality that is unnecessary.  David Riggs suffers from Ankylosing Spondylitis, which results in his back going out at the most inopportune times.  Having him lying on the floor to relieve the pain seemed overkill and I often wondered why it was written into the storyline at all.  Since this is my only complaint, it becomes a minor infraction.<br /><br />The mental picture of Melanie looking up at the painting of Meagan, realizing that she resembles that little girl, is vivid.  I could feel Melanie's confusion, and almost panic of wondering if her new life is about to end if she doesn't play along with the family's strange game.  When Jamie O'Donnell came to her rescue and showed them that she should be allowed to be herself, the tension I was feeling eased.  Gardner definitely draws the reader into her web emotionally.<br /><br />The plot was awesome.  The dark side is evident then a typical family life becomes prominent.  This perfect life is then toppled in perfect style, as the reader realizes that nothing is as it seems.  Just when you figure out one part of the puzzle, another twist comes to shake things up again.<br /><br />THE OTHER DAUGHTER is fast paced and will leave the reader guessing until the very end.

That was the question I pondered as I read of his plans to undergo an experimental surgery at a hospital in North Carolina to help him regain operation of his useless limbs.  Would it change his relationship with Amelia?  What would happen to Thom?<br /><br />However, when he arrives the sheriff of Tanner's Corner comes to him for help.  Coincidence?  Supposedly the sheriff's cousin knows Lincoln and tells him that he's in North Carolina.  Seemed a bit pat for me, but that didn't ruin the story.<br /><br />A local 16-year-old known as the Insect Boy (Garrett Hanlon) has an obsession with bugs, any kind of bugs.  He's kidnapped Mary Beth McConnell (whom he has stalked for months) and Lydia Johansson, killed a man trying to save Mary Beth, and fled into the local wilderness to hide.  With Amelia's help, Lincoln solves the mystery of where the boy is taking/holding his victims and Garrett is easily captured.  Since this happened in the middle of the book, I was left wondering if the rest would pertain to Lincoln's surgery.  Nope, he does have a few consultations with the doctor and the negative aspects of the surgery are discussed in detail, but there's more to Garrett's story.<br /><br />Seems Amelia doesn't believe the boy is guilty, so she helps him escape and goes into hiding with him.  Lincoln, on the other hand, fears for Amelia's safety and again helps the local police find Garrett.  With Amelia throwing false hints to Lincoln it's no easy task but very enjoyable to read about.<br /><br />The storyline was difficult to believe at times.  The final disclosures about Tanner's Corner are a bit much, the hicks who pop up at the most inopportune times are a bit too coincidental, as is the sheriff coming to Lincoln for help as he enters the hospital.  If you can get past these instances, then you'll enjoy the rest of the book.<br /><br />The players are a wide assortment of country hicks, educated geeks, and a few normal types thrown in for balance.  Each was well developed and enjoyable.  Lincoln Rhyme was a bit more impatient and abrupt than we've seen in the past, but it just added another layer to his persona.<br /><br />As is Deaver's trademark, THE EMPTY CHAIR has a few unexpected twists to keep the reader guessing the identity of the bad guys.  Although different than THE COFFIN DANCE, THE BONE COLLECTOR, and DEVIL'S TEARDROP, the identities in this one were clear to me.  Even without the surprise ending, THE EMPTY CHAIR was very pleasurable.cks, educated geeks, and a few normal types thrown in for balance.  Each was well developed and enjoyable.

He infiltrated a drug cartel and when the time came to arrest Miguel Calderone a blood bath occurred.  Still undercover, Jonah is being arrested when Alejandro (Miguel's son) shoots a DEA agent next to Jonah.  Without thinking, Jonah kills Alejandro and Miguel realizes Jonah is an undercover agent and vows revenge.<br /><br />The next series of events takes you on a whirlwind journey - Calderone's men break into the home of Jonah's one-time girlfriend (Felicity), kill her, shoot her father, and kidnap her son.  Yep, you guessed it: the son is Jonah's only he never knew he had a son.  Felicity had lied to him about her pregnancy and for fifteen years, he's been under the belief that she had an abortion.<br /><br />Macie Blaine, Felicity's sister, finds Jonah and begs him to save her nephew and informs him that the child is actually his son.  It's a bit convoluted but McCall brings all of the facts together.  Some of the events are a bit hard to fathom - like Calderone taking a drug in prison that stops his heart, so he appears dead.  The warden signing his body over to his \\"sister\\" with no questions and in only a matter of minutes is not realistic.  But without that happening, they would never be able to have Calderone break out of prison and the big finale would not take place<br /><br />Another bit of fluff was the fact that kidnapped Evan Blaine uses his hands to try to claw open a window getting splinters under his nails, and ripping his fingertips.  These fester and become infected to the point his hands are almost useless.  Now why couldn't he pull those splinters out?  Usually when splinters fester, one good squeeze and it pops right out.  Why the drama of the hurt hands?<br /><br />The characters were interesting.  Declyn Blaine was only glossed over, but his boisterous, dogmatic personality was made very clear.  Jonah Slade was strong yet tender when he allowed his emotions to come to the surface.  Maybe those emotions surfaced a bit too easily for a man who has been through hell for fifteen years, but that could be overlooked most of the time.  Macie Blaine was the weakest person in the story.  For one who runs an international import business, she lacked the drive and strong personality that it would take to do that career.  Instead she is mild mannered, and basically weak.<br /><br />The mystery side of the story goes along smoothly most of the time.  A few blimps (like a FBI agent called by 2 different names or the use of an abandoned submarine lookout in Southern California - um, I've lived here most of my life and have never seen anything like that near La Jolla) do not detract from the tale.  The quick romance of Macie and Jonah is difficult to stomach at times, especially when the dialog becomes wimpy (\\"You dirty so and so\\" - what CIA man would use that terminology?).<br /><br />Overall THE PERFECT LIE is a good book with a few bumps in the road.  I would definitely suggest that Ms. McCall find a new editor though so the sophomoric errors will stop in her future books.was only glossed over, but his boisterous, dogmatic personality was made very clear.

I would definitely suggest that Ms. McCall find a new editor though so the sophomoric errors will stop in her future books.   <br />	2005-06-15

With Soneji reeking havoc on the US Eastern Coast, and Mr. Smith in Europe comparing notes and competing, Alex Cross must stop both of them, albeit not single handedly.<br /><br />Since Soneji's recent escape from prison, he has vowed revenge with Alex Cross for putting him there.  Seems now he has AIDS and knows his time is limited so his vendetta is at the forefront of his mind.  He has tunnel vision and is only focusing on what he wants to do to Alex and his family.  What's creepy about this is Soneji hiding in Alex's basement without anyone knowing he's there (which he does several times).  I would have thought a police detective would have better security than this and this was too unbelievable for me to comprehend.<br /><br />As Soneji is leading Alex all over via Amtrak, FBI profiler, Thomas Pierce is hot on the trail of Mr. Smith in Paris and London.  Bouncing back and forth across the Atlantic became a bit jerky and I felt some motion sickness.  These were not smooth transitions all the time - it was almost as if Patterson wrote two separate stories and just placed them together as you would shuffle cards.<br /><br />Character development was superb.  Patterson lets Alex evolve by showing us his sensitive side with the wooing of Christina Johnson at the Rainbow Room in New York.  He portrays Alex as a sensitive, tough cop who is the dream man for most women.  Sampson is another who can fall into the sensitive-tough guy role and it does not detract from his persona but instead attracts.  Soneji continues to be a moral outcast and nothing is too diabolical for him.  Because Mr. Smith's identity is hidden, he is a bit under-developed; however, the parallels between he and Pierce are clear.<br /><br />The suspense is at an all time high with CAT AND MOUSE, but knowing the identity of Mr. Smith is not a surprise.  The conclusions to most subplots are anti-climatic and not up to Patterson's usual cliffhanger mode.  It was as if he gave up in the middle of this project and quickly tied things up.  Although a good book, the first books in this series surpass CAT AND MOUSE.er-developed; however, the parallels between he and Pierce are clear. <br /> <br />The suspense is at an all time high with CAT AND MOUSE, but knowing the identity of Mr. Smith is not a surprise.

Jack is trying to find out the identity as well as a motive for this murder.  He finds Frank's \\"niece\\" Isabella who runs Abbott House, a bed and breakfast near White Mountain Fertility Clinic.  Her father and the \\"uncles\\" raised Isabella after her mother died in childbirth, which by itself could have made for an interesting story.  Throw into the mix the fact that the \\"uncles\\" are scientists and doctors who founded the White Mountain Fertility Clinic with Isabella's father and the story takes on a new dimension.  As Jack delves deeper into this murder, interesting information surfaces, as does his attraction to Isabella.<br /><br />Characters are colorful, but while reading about Isabella I shifted to thinking the story took place decades earlier, not in current times.  She is mild mannered, only wants to please the men in her life, can't seem to stand on her own - almost like a 50's woman.  She's definitely not a woman of today's society and wouldn't last thirty minutes in Los Angeles or New York City.  She defers every decision to the \\"uncles\\".  Jack is well described and comes across as a typical FBI agent and macho man.  The \\"uncles\\" are charming and each personality becomes vivid and alluring.<br /><br />As for the story line, well the outline is excellent.  The premise is that someone is determined to kidnap Frank Walton, but instead he is killed in the process.  The question as to why someone wants an elderly scientist is the focus of this entire story.  The White Mountain Fertility Clinic is surrounded in mystery and intrigue.  You can speculate (and probably be correct) but the answers don't appear until the very end.  But what's more farfetched is the underground system.  This clinic was built years ago, and the underground tunnels leading to it and to the labs are incomprehensible.  No one knew there was construction of these happening?  Come on, give me a break - I can understand some secrecy, but not to this extent! It read like they were going into the Bat Cave.<br /><br />The ending is suspenseful although unrealistic.  I felt like I was reading Escape from Witch Mountain or some other childish tale.  It was just a little too pat to suit my taste and I felt a \\"happily ever after\\" coming.  McCall stopped short of doing that but the ending left much to be desired.<br /><br />Overall it was a good tale, and would have been excellent except for Isabella's Stepford-wife demeanor and the ending.  This is one of the few books by Dinah McCall/Sharon Sala that does fall short of being excellent.built years ago, and the underground tunnels leading to it and to the labs are incomprehensible.

Seems the entire small town of Messina lives and breathes football.  The controversy is the ex-coach, Eddie Rake.<br /><br />Neely hasn't been back to Messina in 15 years, yet he returns along with many other teammates as his coach is dying.  Many gather in the football stadium bleachers to drink beer, tell stories about Coach Rake, and relive the glory days, while waiting for word that Rake has passed.  But the thing is, with those glory days come some hard facts about what it takes to have a successful team.  The 13 state championships did not come without hard work and a coach who would do anything to get his players to perform at top level.<br /><br />To be held on it's own merits, the book falls to mediocre.  However, it will elicit a process of remembering for any athlete who has had a coach like Rake.  The endless Suicide Runs, basketball drills, and yelling that the players are a bunch of \\"cupcakes\\" became uppermost in my mind once again.  Remembering the toughness in the coach who brought out the best and at times the worst in a player, was a sure bet while reading.  I didn't just read about Neely and his teammates' experiences, I remembered living those experiences, and empathized.<br /><br />The seasons are rehashed by the teammates sitting in the bleachers nightly.  One brings a tape of the '87 championship game, surrounded by mystery.  Seems the coaches didn't return to the field after half time and no one has ever said why.  Once the tape is played and the players give their interpretations of what was happening on the field, everyone knows what occurred during that game, both on the field and in the locker room.  Since no one talked, Rake continued as coach.  However, a few years later, he was fired when a player died during his August Hell Week.  And this controversy continues in Messina.<br /><br />Character development is not up to Grisham's usual standards.  Neely is perceived as a guy floundering and feeling sorry for himself because he never made it to the NFL.  Rake is a king who had gotten away with anything he did and given anything he wanted, as long as the Spartans kept winning.  Other players and Neely's ex-girlfriend are only glossed over and few words given to their development.<br /><br />Some subplots left me wondering why.  Why did Neely see his happily married ex-girlfriend to tell her he still loved her?  This didn't seem important to the story at all.  The stories should have remained on the field and in the bleachers.<br /><br />Overall, it was an ok book.  You'll enjoy it more if you are an athlete and can remember your coach being tough, yet believing in you before you believed in yourself.  If you can remember sweating through the pain and tears and performing to your top level because anything less was unacceptable, then this book will be an enjoyable read.in the locker room.

Overall it's very good, but minor flaws detour from making this an excellent read.<br /><br />Widow Diana Ladd is raising her son, David, on the Tohono O'Othham Indian Reservation near Tucson, Arizona, with the help of Rita Antone.  Rita is a Papago Indian basket-weaver/wise woman and has taught David the O'Othham language and customs since he was a toddler.  Six years ago, Diana's testimony had put Andrew Carlisle in prison for the murder of Rita's granddaughter, which also resulted in the death of Diana's husband (Carlisle was involved with her husband and his death was staged to appear as a suicide).  Now Carlisle is out of jail and looking for revenge.  Sounds like a typical mystery, but it's definitely not typical.<br /><br />Gruesome is the one word I would use to define Carlisle.  His signature is to bite the nipples off of his victims.  He thrives on torture, and a quick kill does not make him happy.  He has plans on exactly how he wants Diana Ladd to suffer and this is described in great detail, sometimes to the point of turning my stomach.  The victims he encounters on his hunt for Ladd are tortured and eventually killed but instead of appeasing his appetite for death, they only add to his need to reach Diana Ladd.<br /><br />The Papago legends are written at the beginning of each chapter, which give an interesting twist to the story.  At times it does take away from the tale, and I found myself wanting to skip the legends and get to the story at hand.  Every chapter seemed like overkill.  The O'Othham language is translated, but is difficult to read and understand.  It does not flow smoothly.<br /><br />Character development was excellent.  Jance delved into each personality so I felt as if I personally knew each character.  She left little to the imagination in this aspect.  But in story development, she left a lot to the imagination, or lack thereof.  It seemed as if her outline dictated the droning on of the story.  It was predictable for the most part.  The ending left me wondering why Jance had done the unthinkable to her heroine.

She's punk, she lives in an abandoned apartment on a rooftop, and she doesn't care what anyone thinks of her.  The reader is enraptured by her antics and I wished I could have such a carefree attitude, or at least know someone like her.  The term colorful doesn't do her justice!<br /><br />Rune works for Washington Square Video owned by an overbearing jerk.  When customer Robert Kelly has a late movie that needs to be picked up, Rune is given the assignment.  This simple task is muddied when Rune discovers Kelly's body, an obvious case of murder.  As she exits his apartment, she and a jogger see a green car speed away that she guesses is the murderer.  The police don't move fast enough, so Rune decides to investigate on her own.  She's sure Robert Kelly's murder is somehow tied to the movie he constantly rented, \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\".  As she plugs along looking for clues, the hit men are intent upon eliminating Rune and the jogger who witnessed the car.<br /><br />Thrown into Rune's world is Richard, her boyfriend who is anything but what the reader expects.  Rune is unpretentious to Richard's rigidity.  It was almost as if Deaver had to put Rune in a relationship with a businessman so she wasn't so bizarre she would offend some readers.  I would much rather have enjoyed Rune on her own and not have her fenced in by Richard.  But then again, Richard only has a minor role, so he could easily be overlooked.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are very predictable but Deaver always has a few that catch the reader by surprise.  This mix, along with Rune's antics, make for a story that will have you not only trying to catch the killers with Rune, but also wanting to befriend her and just hang out.  I laughed so hard at times that I had to stop reading and wipe the tears out of my eyes.  Seldom does a character touch the reader like Rune, and when that happens, it's definitely a fun read.<br /><br />MANHATTAN IS MY BEAT is a fast paced book that will capture you from the beginning.  Not as mentally challenging as figuring out the villains in the Lincoln Rhyme series, it will leave you smiling and is a few hours well spent.times that I had to stop reading and wipe the tears out of my eyes.

My favorite Deaver character, Rune, returns in DEATH OF A BLUE MOVIE STAR and continues to entertain her reading audience.  What's not to love about this street-savvy young woman who definitely marches to the beat of her own drummer?  She lives up to her own expectations and doesn't care what others think about her - she has her goals and that's her only focus.<br /><br />Rune is trying to get a break in the film industry and she uses the bombing of a Times Square porn theater as her catalyst.  Utilizing this bombing as background information, she begins a documentary on the porn industry.  With luck on her side, and a persistence that is similar to a bulldog, Rune gets an interview with top porn star, Shelly Lowe.  Needing to wrap up the interview sequence, Rune meets Shelly at her office.  As she waits outside, she glances up as Shelly waves and tells her she'll be right down after she's off the phone.  In the next minute, Shelly's building is devastated by a bomb instantly killing her which thrusts Rune on another case trying to figure out who is responsible for Shelly's death.<br /><br />Deaver introduces us to another quirky character in Sam Healy, a bomb squad detective.  He seems to pop up and save Rune every time she gets into hot water.  Yes, Rune is great at getting into trouble - she is going to solve this crime no matter what measures she has to take, including breaking into offices, buying false IDs, etc.  Sam is soon involved with Rune and the two compliment each other and battle each other.  It makes for an interesting side plot and having this team solve the case brings a new, fun, dimension to story.<br /><br />DEATH OF A BLUE MOVIE STAR focuses on pornography and the seedy side of filmmaking.  Most of the main plot is believable, but some is far-fetched.  The way Deaver describes Shelly Long as a \\"gifted actress\\" is just a bit much.  If she were truly a gifted actress, she'd be making a fortune in the legitimate film industry, not wasting away as a porn star.  Other aspects are more believable.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel; it was a fast read and kept me entertained the entire time.  However, I didn't enjoy it as much as the first Rune epic, MANHATTAN IS MY BEAT.  I'm hoping this 21-year-old will continue her journeys and when Deaver takes a break from Lincoln Rhyme, he'll give us a glimpse into Rune's current world.y as a porn star.

Jeffery Deaver never ceases to amaze me with his imagination in creating believable yet intriguing plots.  STONE MONKEY is no different.<br /><br />The Ghost is a smuggler with few morals.  He has a ship packed full of Chinese immigrants that he blows up less than a mile off of the US coast.  Seems he wanted their cash but didn't really want to fulfill his obligations.  A few manage to escape only to be hunted by The Ghost.  It appears he doesn't want any witnesses.  While they are being pounded by a fierce storm, clutching the life raft, he is shooting at them like sitting ducks.  Enter Amelia Sachs.  She arrives on the beach in time to help save one of the immigrants, while the others elude the authorities and slip away.  Amelia and Lincoln, with the help of their pals, try to find these two families before The Ghost can complete his mission and kill them.<br /><br />A few side plots keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat and make for an enjoyable expedition.  Deaver has a gift that brings the reader into the written word - our hearts pound as one family steals a van to make their getaway; we can smell the tea Dr. Sung gives Amelia to help her with her ailments; we jump at every sound outside of the hideout; we cheer for each member of the Wu and Chang families; we become part of the story.<br /><br />Character development is excellent.  We continue our friendship with Amelia Sachs and Lincoln Rhyme.  And like any good friend, we continue to wonder what is in their futures.  We're introduced to Sonny Li, a Chinese cop who thinks a bit differently than Lincoln and opens him to the possibility of intuition.  I do have to say that he was one of my favorite characters from any of these books - Sonny will make the reader chuckle out loud at his antics, and make you sit back and say, \\"Ahh...\\" after he explains things as he sees them.  Dr. John Sung is another character that is brought to life.  He introduces Amelia to the Chinese homeopathic way of life, becomes her friend, and has the reader guessing if his intentions are platonic or something more.<br /><br />As is Jeffery Deaver's normal style, STONE MONKEY is fast paced and leaves little time to catch your breath between scenes.  Deaver is a master at convincing the reader that he/she knows the identity of The Ghost only to have that belief tossed aside and a new individual chosen.  Deaver is one of the few who has fooled me in the past, but not with this one.  But I just barely figured it out - and cheered at the end when I was right!  Yes, score one for me against the master!comes her friend, and has the reader guessing if his intentions are platonic or something more. <br /> <br />As is Jeffery Deaver's normal style, STONE MONKEY is fast paced and leaves little time to catch your breath between scenes.

In BLIND ALLEY we saw a deranged killer on Jane's trail because she resembled Cira, a woman who lived 2000 years ago.  Now in COUNTDOWN it seems more deranged killers abound trying to find Cira's gold and Jane is once again involved.<br /><br />The story line is not as clear-cut as we've seen Johansen present in the past.  Jane finds herself attacked in an alley, her friend killed in that attack, then Trevor (with whom there are still unresolved romantic issues) returns to whisk her away to Scotland.  While there, he tosses out tidbits about Cira's gold and Cira's scrolls.  That storyline would be enough, but we're also shown that others are on the trail of Cira's gold and these diabolical killers have decided to blow up several large cities in the US.  Another who is on the trail, seems less motivated to find the gold, and is interested in righting wrongs thrust upon those people he cares about.  Three main fractions are hot on the trail, each with their own agenda.  These other two try to trip up Trevor and Jane, but aren't as dynamic as villains in past Johansen episodes.<br /><br />Character development was hit or miss.  Jane continues to be strong and vibrant.  Trevor continues in the same light as when he first came into Jane's life.  We're introduced to new support characters and this is where the development is lacking.  MacDuff is an egocentric Scottish laird intent on taking care of \\"his people\\".  Jock is one of his and it seems he ran away when he was a teenager only to be kidnapped and brainwashed by one of the villains trying to blow up the US.  Jock at times is childlike and at other times is a robotic killer.  Mario is the sweet naïve translator hired to decipher Cira's scrolls.  Reilly is the multi-millionaire intent on having the gold and will stop at nothing to get it.  This includes making a deal with Grozak, a man who's only goal is to kill as many Americans as he can.  Reilly and Grozak's characters are never dissected so the reader can understand what makes them tick. Why is Grozak so intent on destroying cities in the US?  The pat answer of being angry about going to jail as a teen just doesn't jibe with the amount of hatred we see.  Reilly is glossed over - he's into mind control and brainwashing.  Why is he so intent on Cira's gold?  It was a blend that didn't work for me.<br /><br />I usually am thrilled with Iris Johansen's work, and although I'd recommend COUNTDOWN, it seemed as if this was just a filler for her next book.  And yes, the way this one ended, you can be guaranteed that a sequel is in the works.

However, PRAYING FOR SLEEP falls to mediocre in my opinion.<br /><br />Set in New England, Lisbonne Atcheson is dealing with flooding that could ruin the home she recently inherited from her mother, along with her extensive hot houses.  While all of this is going on, she learns that Michael Hrubek has escaped a mental institution and is on the loose.  Lisbonne helped convict Michael as the Indian Leap State Park Murderer a few years before and now his trail is leading towards her.<br /><br />Michael is strange - he's huge (about 300 pounds), and mentally inept.  He can't focus on things for long periods of time - he is childlike and heinous at the same time.  He wavers between the current problems and his own imagination, like believing he assassinated President Lincoln.  If befriended, he easily jumps to an out of control mode, leaving everyone in danger.  His strength is the downfall of those believing him only to be childlike.<br /><br />The characters are somewhat interesting although mundane.  Lisbonne Atcheson is superficial and more worried about how people will view her if this madman attacks.  Lisbonne's character does evolve but still leaves the reader shaking his/her head wondering how someone so pliant could testify in a murder case.  Lisbonne's husband, Owen, is a jerk - plain and simple.  He responds to all situations by his ego and decides to hunt and kill Michael.  His reaction to this situation is over-the-top and leaves the reader wondering WHY.  Dr. Richard Kohler is Michael's therapist who seems to be on the verge of a break through with him at the time of his disappearance.  We're only given glimpses of Kohler and his character could have been so much more complex.  My favorite character is Trenton Heck, a professional tracker.  Trenton is a Good-Ole'-Boy who agrees to help locate Michael.  He drives an old pick up and always has his trusted bloodhound Emil with him.  Trenton is the only real person developed in this story.  He gives PRAYING FOR SLEEP a much needed boost in characterization.<br /><br />Through the use of flashbacks, the reader learns what really happened at Indian Leap, but everyone will have figured out the truth long before it's revealed.  The story is well developed and Deaver leads the reader through an interesting but uneventful journey.  It's not one of Deaver's best tales but it is better than a lot of things on the market.an old pick up and always has his trusted bloodhound Emil with him.

I'm not sure what motivated James Patterson to pursue this science fiction type of writing, but it was an interesting deviation from his normal thrillers.

Frannie is still trying to recover and carry on with her life, while separating herself from the human race - she prefers the company of her animals.  Frannie rents out one of her cabins to Kit Harrison, whom she thinks is a hunter.  I found this a bit strange considering she abhors hunters yet still rented to him.  Kit eventually breaks through the emotional walls she's erected leaving them both uncomfortable.  We then find out that Kit is not on vacation; he's actually an FBI agent following a lead on a group who are trying to speed up human evolution with genetic experiments.  Yes, it's very bizarre.<br /><br />This would be enough of a plot line, but Patterson throws more in the mix with the appearance of winged children - Max and Matt - who are eventually joined by others.  They have broken away from the wayward lab and are running/flying for their lives.  Max is found by Frannie, and so begins the journey into the bizarre world of genetic mutations.<br /><br />The reader is tossed back and forth between the genetic experiments, the non-mystery of Frannie's husband's death, and the new relationship between Kit and Frannie.  The transitions are short and choppy, leaving the reader with a case of motion sickness.  There is no smoothness in this book at all, and there are few surprises.  Patterson could have easily left out one of the sidelines to make for a smoother plot but instead convoluted the story with too many subplots.<br /><br />Character develop was at an all time low for Patterson.  We were introduced to the characters only to have that introduction stopped short before we fully understood what makes them tick.  We were introduced and the direction quickly averted to other interests.<br /><br />At times WHEN THE WIND BLOWS is endearing and at other times it's just plain weird.  I had a hard time grasping a few of the concepts and in a few places it was hard to understand the direction.  Patterson did a good job summing up the plot and wrapping most of the things up.

New fans and old alike will be thrilled with this story!<br /><br />Jim Beckett was the perfect man: a decorated cop, attentive boyfriend, and he had everything going for him.  That was until Tess married him.  Tess seemed to have been handpicked by Beckett because she was a pretty cheerleader in a small town, overpowered by her demanding father, and demur.  Eager to get away from a horrible childhood, Tess jumps at the chance to marry the perfect husband.  Little did she know her life would be turned upside down.<br /><br />Two years later, Tess helps the police gather the evidence needed to convict Jim of ten brutal serial murders.  He nearly kills Tess while being arrested, and of course he vows revenge for her part in his demise.  Six months later, Jim butchers two guards and escapes the maximum-security prison.  Seeking to avenge his wife's betrayal, he's hunting her.  Tess decides to fight and take her life back from this monster, something that is completely unexpected.  J.T. Dillion, an ex-marine/mercenary type, enters the picture and helps Tess learn to defend herself while the romantic sparks fly as hot as the Arizona desert in which they are hidden.<br /><br />The characters are a bit under-developed.  We're given glimpses as to why Tess is so mild mannered and meek - her father was abusive and overpowering.  J.T. Dillion is a macho egomaniac with secrets that are not so elusive.  His sister, Marion, is an over-the-top FBI agent with secrets of her own.  The main theme of this book seems to be abuse:  Marion was sexually abused as a child; both her father and husband physically and emotionally abused Tess; his father physically and emotionally abused J.T. Dillion.  Can all of these victims teach each other to cope and live a normal life?  It seems to be a bit too coincidental that all of these victims have relationships with each other.  What's more are those relationships seemed to work.<br /><br />The action of the book is intense.  The story line moves quickly and doesn't dwell on the past hardships.  When you think you've figured out the direction of the story, it quickly moves in a different, although enjoyable direction.  Nothing is as it seems in this book.  It is unsettling to read some of the gruesome scenes laid out, but Gardner does it well and has the reader in her grasp from the beginning.  Her villain is excruciating and the readers will love it!<br /><br />THE PERFECT HUSBAND is definitely a perfect book to add to your reading list!relationships seemed to work. <br /> <br />The action of the book is intense.

STORM WARNING has the reader wondering if this could really happen and lets your imagination take over from there, similar to John Saul's GUARDIAN.<br /><br />Seven girls who attended a gifted class when they were very young in 1979 are suddenly committing suicide with no warning and under very bizarre circumstances - each receive a phone call and become entranced and kill themselves.  When Ginny Shapirio, an investigative reporter, realizes she's the only one left from this class, she begins to wonder.  She receives a letter of warning from Sister Mary Theresa (her best friend) warning her not to answer the phone.  Sister Mary Theresa has linked their classmates' deaths to a phone call right before their demise.  However, Sister Mary Theresa dies before the letter is received and Ginny flees to try to save herself - but from what or whom she's not certain.<br /><br />FBI agent Sullivan Dean, finds Ginny, and tries to help.  It's a convoluted chain of friendships that gets Dean involved, but once you figure that out, you understand his drive.  Ginny and Dean strive to figure out why these suicides happened, and what can be done to stop the \\"trigger\\" from setting off Ginny.<br /><br />Character development is excellent.  McCall creates a vibrant victim in Ginny - she's smart, attractive, and a strong female.  Dean is also robust and the perfect match to compliment Ginny.  Thrown in is a Nobel-winning doctor (Emile Karnoff) who is a bit eccentric but believes in his theory of using hypnosis to heal.  Emile comes with his crazy son and doting wife (she thrives on keeping everything tidy).<br /><br />The plot line is a bit farfetched, but fun.  To spice up the thriller side of the story, a good dose of romance is tossed in for good measure.  STORM WARNING is a perfect blend of thriller and romance.  Dinah McCall (AKA Sharon Sala) is definitely an author to peruse.

She writes a story that will keep the reader captivated from the beginning until she decides to let you go.  Chores will wait, sleep will wait, everything will wait until you know the end of this story!<br /><br />Liz Ames is a family counselor who moves to Key West to find her sister.  Pastor Rachel Howard disappeared after leaving Liz a strange phone message - \\"I've uncovered something - they're watching...\\"  Shortly after that message was left, Rachel disappeared without a trace.  Liz riles the local authorities with her endless questions and investigations.  Police Chief, Val Lopez does not think anything happened to her sister and has other more pressing matters on his hands.  It seems as if a slew of mysterious deaths and questionable disappearances have plagued this enchanted area.  These include a loan officer who falls to his death from a second story window, a missing bank employee who's body washes up on the beach, and a teenage girl being counseled by Liz murdered in what appears to be the work of a infamous \\"New Testament\\" serial killer currently residing in prison.  Enter into the picture is Rick Wells, ex-Miami cop who now owns a local bar.  Romantic sparks fly as Rick helps Liz try to figure out what happened to Rachel.<br /><br />Strong character development is one of Spindler's trademarks.  In DEAD RUN, we not only have Liz and Rick, we are also given a colorful support cast.  Val Lopez is authoritative and demonstrative, not wanting to believe anything bad can happen on his watch.  Pastor Tim, Rachel's successor is a bit of a bland character who has secrets of his own.  Heather Ferguson, a drop dead gorgeous bikini store owner who is just mystifying enough to send up red flags as to her innocence.<br /><br />The story line is the typical good versus evil, satanic verses holy.  At times Spindler flips from mystery/thriller to such heavy romantic overtures, that the reader isn't sure which genre they picked up when they grabbed this book.  The reader will go from intense suspense to hot and heavy sex in the matter of a few pages.  Other than flip-flopping genres, this is an exciting story that will keep you interested throughout.

To say that John Grisham detoured from his normal writing style with A PAINTED HOUSE is an understatement.  Not only did he not write a legal thriller, he wrote a book that, in my opinion, was a waste of paper!<br /><br />A PAINTED HOUSE revolves around farm life back in 1952 Arkansas.  The book is written from Luke Chandler's perspective, a 7 year old who is struggling to grasp his role in life, as well figuring out the various nuisances of changing America.  He's led a sheltered life on the farm and his only key interests are baseball and picking cotton.  Although he'd much rather not pick cotton, he sees it as part of his responsibility as a family member.<br /><br />The Chandler farm hires migrant Mexicans to help pick cotton every year.  Luke's grandfather, Pappy, isn't the nicest guy around and is very demeaning to Mexicans and the \\"hill people\\" hired to pick.  When there are racial tensions between the two groups, this leads to murder.  Luke is a witness but is sworn to secrecy by a threat to his entire family.  This is the only excitement in the book and Luke sulking around would have been noticed by his family, not ignored as we are led to believe.<br /><br />The flood from the river rising was an interesting twist, if you could call it that.  But it was more of a let down than if it had been fully developed into something with more essence.<br /><br />Luke goes through a range of emotions trying to figure out what is happening around him - not only is he hiding a secret about murder, he's worried about his uncle who is away, his possible life away from the farm, and a rift in the family that leaves him feeling torn.  These could have easily made for a great story, but they were not developed to that point.  Instead I felt like I was flapping in the wind, and the direction changed before anything real could be felt.<br /><br />The stereotypes are the only thing we're given as character development with the \\"hill people\\" and the Mexican workers.  We're not given any meat to them, even though they are a vibrant part of the storyline.  Even Luke's parents are not given any in-depth characterization.  His mom comes off as a meek woman who goes with the flow of whatever Pappy and her husband say.<br /><br />There is no substance to A PAINTED HOUSE.  I finished the book and sat there wondering \\"why\\".  Why was it written?  Why did it end like it did?  Why did I feel as if I'd just spent a few hours of wasted time?  Grisham needs to stick with his courtroom drama.  This one is lacking in every aspect.We're not given any meat to them, even though they are a vibrant part of the storyline.

In the Garden is owned by Roz Harper, who is a blunt individual (everyone always knows where they stand with her) she pulls no punches about anything.  Although Roz tries to be the tough guy, she opens her home to a newly widowed mother of two, Stella Rothchild, who has just been hired as her new Garden Manager.  I should also mention that Roz' estate is haunted by the \\"Harper Bride\\", a ghost who plays havoc among the people living there.  Stella doesn't believe at first, but the ghost soon makes a believer out of her when she is heard and seen singing to Stella's boys at night.  Seems the Harper Bride befriends children but not always adults.<br /><br />Stella efficiently juggles managing the nursery, dealing with two young boys uprooted from familiar surroundings, and dealing with In The Garden employees.  Stella handles all of it well until the local landscape designer, whom she is supposed to work with, comes crashing into her life.  Stella and Logan clash to say the least.  While Logan is unorganized to Stella's over-organized persona, romance soon blooms.  And this romance is anything but smooth sailing however the bumps in the road are what make it a fun ride.<br /><br />Nora Roberts creates a perfect blend of wit, charm and angst among the characters.  The character development is excellent from the overbearing Roz; to Hayley who is Roz' cousin and shows up pregnant, looking for a home and work; to Logan who is a hunk who thrives on chaos; to Stella who thrives on neat organization.  The plot is a bit clich&eacute; at the beginning but quickly picks up speed.  Overall BLUE DAHLIA is a great way to start a trilogy, leaving the reader anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.	2005-06-02

Not so with James Patterson's Women's Murder Club series - it rivals his Alex Cross series.  Both are filled with action packed pages and characters to which the reader can relate.<br /><br />In 4TH OF JULY, Lindsay is accused of police brutality and excessive force, causing her to be put on administrative leave while the trial is on going.  She is also recovering from being shot by these minors who were pursued for horrendous murders.  Instead of staying in San Francisco and being hounded by the media, Lindsay housesits for her sister in Half Moon Bay and baby-sits her pot-bellied pig.<br /><br />Instead of resting and relaxing, she soon discovers a series of murders that don't seem to have any connection except for the murderer's signature.  Lindsay plunges headfirst into helping the local law enforcement solve these murders, while preparing for her upcoming trial.  She gets a bit too close to solving the crime and begins to endure threats, such as being attacked with semi-automatic fire while sleeping.<br /><br />Characters are always Patterson's strong suit and this is no exception.  The villains' identities are not hard to figure out, but that doesn't detour from the enjoyment of this book.  The entire ensemble is fun - from the slimy owner of a porn shop who just happens to be an ex-porn star, to the local mechanic who is smitten with Lindsay, to the Head of a Orphanage and her daughter who become good friends with Lindsay, to a local attorney who literally runs over Lindsay while she's walking her dog, to the police chief who is not happy with Lindsay for butting into his investigation, to Yuki - Lindsay's new attorney.<br /><br />The story is a bit on the predictable side; well at least the outcome is predictable.  The jumping back and forth between the courtroom and Half Moon Bay will keep the reader hooked.  There is enough action to keep you from wanting to put the book down!<br /><br />4TH OF JULY continues with this great series and I'm hoping Patterson throws some twists and turns into the next installment.

Jillian Hunter has created a strong, unique family with the Boscastles, who easily compare to Nora Roberts MacGregors.  The reader never knows what to expect from these individuals.  Entertaining does not even begin to describe them.<br /><br />Chloe Bostcastle, the rambunctious younger sister of the Boscastle clan, is determined to enjoy life no matter what the outcome.  She's banished to Chistlebury to stay with relatives after she's caught kissing a man in public.  Chistlebury is a sedate country town where Chloe's family is sure that she can't get into trouble.  But if there is to be trouble, it is sure to find Chloe.<br /><br />Dominic Breckland, finds himself in Chloe's lingerie.  Not a bad place for a dead man.  Seems he was stabbed and presumed dead, staged his funeral, and is now intent on finding the man responsible for his death, as well as that of his brother and Chloe's brother.  Hiding in Chloe's closet to escape being hunted, he must trust her to help him.  And so begins the journey into murder, mayhem, and romance.<br /><br />Character development is excellent, as is Jillian Hunter's norm.  Hunter puts two strong characters together and the reader enjoys the sparks flying.  Chloe is strong willed, gorgeous, and not about to be bullied into forming to expectations.  Dominic is also strong willed, ruggedly handsome, and used to people jumping at his command.  Both are quick tongued and intelligent, which gives the reader many pages of witty banter between the two.<br /><br />The villain is not unknown, but how Dominic exposes him is a mystery.  The final duel was a bit of a letdown and the outcome expected.  Even though we all knew it was coming, it was still very entertaining and a worthwhile reading adventure.  I think the best part of Hunter's books is the repartee between characters.<br /><br />THE LOVE AFFAIR OF AN ENGLISH LORD is a wonderful book and makes the reader anxious for the conclusion to this trilogy, THE WEDDING NIGHT OF AN ENGLISH ROGUE.  My biggest complaint is that Hunter has created the Boscastle family with so many diverse characters, it's a shame more books couldn't be written to give each of them time for their own story to be told.r has created the Boscastle family with so many diverse characters, it's a shame more books couldn't be written to give each of them time for their own story to be told.	2005-05-31

NO ONE'S EVER SICK IN SPRINGFIELD seemed like an odd title for a book, but what the heck, it sounded interesting from what the back jacket had to say.  About 30 pages into the book, the reader understands the significance of the title.<br /><br />Dean Escher is thrown into a nightmare when his wife, Rose, loses her grasp on reality.  Her headlong plunge into her own world is marred with violent crimes, beginning with shooting her husband and taking their diabetic son, Michael, along on her hunt for utopia.  Entering into the picture is a burned-out detective, Hammy Stokes, and psychiatrist Frances Odom.  They team up to try to figure out where Rose is headed so they can save Michael before he slips into a diabetic coma.<br /><br />Rose travels all over Downey, Norwalk, and surrounding Southern California areas looking for her perfect home - a place where all the bad things can be held at bay and she can finally be happy.  In her wake, she continues her crime spree of killing those who don't cooperate and help her in her quest.<br /><br />NO ONE'S EVER SICK IN SPRINGFIELD starts out a bit slow, but from page 26 on, I was hooked.  This psychological thriller reminded me of Dean Koontz's THE VISION or INTENSITY.  This will definitely get your mind racing wondering what Rose will do next, and how Hammy, Frances and Dean can stop her.<br /><br />The character development is excellent from the two main characters of Dean and Rose, to the support cast of Hammy, Frances, and Dean's brother Roy.  We're even given glimpses at a few lesser supporters with Cuddles (a porn star), a hit man living in a junkyard, and three juvenile delinquents.<br /><br />The plot starts out a bit slow, but picks up speed very quickly.  The reader will be held tight until the end while trying to figure out where Rose is headed.  For those who live in Southern California, her destination isn't a surprise, but it's still an enjoyable ride getting there.<br /><br />Chaz Thompson has created a novel rivaling Dean Koontz and others who write psychological thrillers.

I figured anything written by James Patterson has suspense and edge-of-your seat entertainment.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting when I picked up a copy of SUZANNE'S DIARY TO NICHOLAS, but it was definitely not this!  There was no suspense at all in this book, and at times it was just a weepy attempt to draw out the reader's emotions.<br /><br />Katie Wilkinson is a book editor who is experiencing heartbreak.  Matt, her boyfriend leaves her without any indication that things weren't wonderful between them.  But he does leave her a gift, hoping it will explain his quick departure.  The present is Suzanne (his first wife's) diary that she kept for their son, Nicholas.  At first angry, Katie doesn't understand why Matt wants her to read this very personal recount of his first love's life. But she begins to read hoping to find something in there to make her understand.<br /><br />Although it's difficult for Katie to read Suzanne's words of love, she continues to read.  She learns that Suzanne had a heart attack at a young age that caused lifestyle changes.  Through these changes, she meets Matt, a neighbor in Martha's Vineyard where Suzanne moves to reduce stress.  Katie reads about Suzanne's love for Matt, their excitement over her pregnancy, and their devotion to Nicholas.<br /><br />While reading I felt like a voyeur, like I was reading Suzanne's diary along with Katie and it was something so full of emotions that it should have remained private.  The bouncing back and forth from first person to third person narrative by Patterson was not an easy transition at times and was confusing.<br /><br />Although the character development was extremely well done, I didn't like SUZANNE'S DIARY TO NICHOLAS.  To me, the plot was an attempt to pull the heartstrings and force the reader to feel emotion.  Instead of feeling empathy for all people involved in this story, I felt depressed.  If I had known that this book would have been so much of a downer, I would never have read it.<br /><br />However, with that said, I do have to say that the ending did surprise me.

This had all of the classic pieces of a mystery/suspense with a few additions to liven the mix.  It kept my attention from the very beginning until the end.<br /><br />Ashley Montague, started out as a rookie cop and when her instructors at the academy saw her skill as an artist, she soon became a forensic artist.  Ashley is young and trying to grab life by the horns.  When she passes by a traffic accident she sees a man in a cloak but doesn't pay much attention.  Afterwards she learns that the victim is a friend of hers and she doesn't believe what the authorities are saying about the things involving him.  They consider him a junkie who couldn't stay out of traffic and she won't let it go.  She sketches the scene from her own memory.  It helps that she has a photographic memory...  This picture haunts her because there is something there but she just can't put her finger on it.<br /><br />Ashley meets Jake Dilessio, a detective who is cranky and a jerk at times.  Several years earlier Jake lost his partner and he's sure Peter Bordon, a local cult leader, was the triggerman.  When a new body appears in the Everglades, Jake begins wondering if Bordon had a partner (since he's in prison).<br /><br />Added to this police business, is the fact that Ashley's uncle owns a bar and Jake keeps his boat in a slip near there.  They literally run into each other, and sparks fly.  At first they are sparks of annoyance, and later become sparks of a romantic nature.<br /><br />Heather Graham leads the reader down a course that is anything but straight.  With a list of possible villains, she narrows it down, only to have a few more facts tossed in to make you wonder if you have the right person in mind.<br /><br />Character development is excellent as are the descriptions of Florida.  The scenes are so vivid that you actually think you are part of the story.<br /><br />PICTURE ME DEAD is a great suspense book and is at the top of my Favorites list.

In my opinion, Sandra Brown has published 5-star suspense books for the past several years and she doesn't break from that with THE CRUSH.  With a cast of unique characters, the reader will be swept along on a tale that makes it impossible to put this book down until the last paragraph has been read.<br /><br />Dr. Rennie Newton is a successful trauma surgeon, who is independent and a workaholic.  When she's called for jury duty on a murder case, she doesn't realize that her perfectly structured world is about to drastically change.  The defendant, Ricky Lozada, is a killer for hire who is acquitted.  While on trial, Lozada becomes infatuated with Rennie.  After his acquittal, he begins to pursue her.  When a colleague is murdered because Lozada thinks he's Rennie's love interest, Rennie is thrown into a series of events that turn her world upside down.<br /><br />Entering into the picture is Wick Threadgill, a police detective on an indefinite leave of absence who now spends his time as a private eye.  Seems Wick can't get his act together after the murder of his brother, who just happens to have been murdered by Lozada.  Wick falls hard for Rennie, even though her secret past has him wondering at times exactly where her loyalties lie.<br /><br />In the support cast roles are Oren Wesley, Wick's old partner who investigates the murder of Rennie's colleague.  There is also Grace Wesley, Oren's wife, who seems to cut through the male testosterone and get to the heart of the matter - she's down to earth and gives a nice balance to Oren and becomes Rennie's ally.<br /><br />The story is action packed and full of loops that will have even those who always figure out the tale before the end wondering if they are correct with their predictions.  Sandra Brown keeps tossing in more fuel to the fire with little tidbits to keep the reader saying, \\"Ahh...\\"  The final face-off between Wick and Lozada is perfect - anticipation builds to a startling climax, which won't let you down!<br /><br />Mystery/suspense writers could use THE CRUSH as a textbook - it's blends the perfect mix of suspense and intrigue with romance and feel good moments.  The only disappointments are the reason Lozada becomes a psychopath (his younger disabled brother got all of his parent's attention) and Rennie's secrets.  A little more thought could have gone into those areas, but otherwise everything is great.<br /><br />After finishing, I was a bit disappointed, as the characters were so familiar that I wanted their story to continue.

A little more thought could have gone into those areas, but otherwise everything is great.   <br /> <br />After finishing, I was a bit disappointed, as the characters were so familiar that I wanted their story to continue.  That's the marking of a great book, you don't want it to end! <br />	2005-05-25

Sandra Brown can take a song lyric and make it into a great suspense book, as seen with HELLO, DARKNESS.  It's wonderful!<br /><br />Paris Gibson is a radio DJ working the night shift.  She works alone and enjoys that solitude.  She only interacts with others when listeners call into her station for requests and to chat.  She has one of the highest rated programs in the area and her fans divulge everything to her, while she guards her privacy with an iron fist.  She has a past that she doesn't want anyone to know about.<br /><br />A listener who identifies himself as Valentino calls and tells her about a horrible crime he's about to commit.  Paris calls the police and is thrown into the limelight.  Dean Mallow is on the case, and knows Paris from a previous life.  Seems Paris was engaged and eventually married Dean's best friend.  But she didn't marry him before she had a brief affair with Dean.  Of course there is angst, Sandra Brown does that the best!<br /><br />Dean tries to protect Paris, while trying to capture Valentino.  Paris tries to protect her privacy, while trying to keep Dean at arm's length.  Valentino has other ideas to get Paris' attention - Sandra Brown even describes this villain as a predator who preys on minors and these crimes are horrific.  Brown brings to light many parents worst fears when thinking of their teenager's safety.  The horror knows no bounds.<br /><br />The characters are vivid and real - one can easily relate to Dean, Paris, or Gavin (Dean's teenage son).

When an archeology dig brings Callie Dunbrook to Woodsboro, Maryland, there's more in store than old bones in the ground, there are a few skeletons in Callie's closet as well.  Callie comes to the dig site only to find her ex-husband, Jacob Greystone already there and part of the team.  Callie agrees to work with Jake since this is the most important dig in her career.<br /><br />Suzanne Cullen, a successful cookie entrepreneur, sees the news reports of the dig and believes that Callie is her long lost daughter - the one taken from her stroller in a mall when she was only a few months old.  Suzanne begins her quest to prove her daughter has returned.<br /><br />This is where it gets a bit confusing.  Jake is still in love with Callie and does everything in his power to win her back.  Suzanne is convinced Callie is her daughter and refuses to listen to anyone who says otherwise.  Callie hires a lawyer, Lana, who is dating Doug Cullen, Suzanne's son and possibly Callie's brother.  And there are other subplots too numerous to recant.<br /><br />There is an overload of characters in this tale and many come to the forefront and focus becomes lost.  The reader is tossed from one plot to another like a piece of paper in the wind.  There is the Callie/Jake angle, the Callie as a stolen baby angle, the Doug/Lana angle, the murder of a worker, and other small inconsequential stories.<br /><br />Even with the abundance of characters, most are well developed - the reader can understand Callie's anger with Jake, can sympathize with Jake when we are told what really happened to cause the separation, can empathize with Suzanne over the loss of her daughter and her determination to find her, and the frustration of Doug as you realize that his mother has spent her life focusing on her lost daughter instead of the son in front of her.<br /><br />The plot and sub plots are a bit convoluted and at times some seem minor and unnecessary.  I'm not sure if Roberts had a minimum page requirement, or if she was just unfocused at times.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book and will entertain.  It's not a brain quest to figure out the villain behind the murder, but it is enjoyable.  BIRTHRIGHT is not Nora Roberts' best, but then again, even an average Nora Roberts book is better than most authors' most outstanding work.seem minor and unnecessary.

Matt Stone owns a historic bed and breakfast home, Melody House, in Virginia that was built before the Revolutionary War.  When people start telling him the house is haunted, Matt agrees to let Harrison Investigations check out the strange happenings even though he doesn't believe in ghosts!<br /><br />Darcy Tremayne is a paranormal investigator for Harrison Investigations who does believe in ghosts.  She is also a bit on the psychic side, guided by her dead friend Josh, she often sees things others don't.  When the ghosts appear to Darcy one issues a warning.  Darcy tries to prove that they not only exist, but one is trying to tell Darcy who killed her.  This is when accidents begin to happen to Darcy - someone doesn't want the truth to be told.<br /><br />In this romantic suspense genre, nothing is left out - you have a mix of romance, suspense, murder, lies and cover-ups. The story line starts out as a typical romantic \\"who dun it\\", but soon has you holding on for a wild ride - Graham changes directions as quickly as free-fall roller coaster.<br /><br />Heather Graham has excellent character development and creates a support cast that is wonderful.  Darcy and Matt are both strong characters and often debate any issue at hand.  Penny, has worked for Matt for years as the caretaker of Melody House, is like part of the family, and truly believes the house is haunted wanting to use that as a marketing ploy for the bed and breakfast trade.  Carter is Matt's childhood friend and Clint is his cousin, both stay near Melody House and help Matt with the upkeep and everyday chores.  Carter also dabbles in Real Estate.  They both have their individual charm and charisma.  Clara is the resident ghost - yes, she's been seen and everyone except Matt believes she exists.  Along with this cast, we're given glimpses of colorful town folk -Mae the bar owner, Lavinia the ex-wife, Mrs. O'Hara the librarian, Delilah newly elected town councilwoman and a host of others.  This diverse group only adds to the charm and witty exchanges found throughout HAUNTED.<br /><br />HAUNTED is tricky and the reader will think they know the identity only to have red herrings tossed out and the doubt begins.

THE RIGHT PATH is the story of Morgan James who is on vacation in Greece to try and pull herself out of the rut that was her life. On her first night she is grabbed on the beach and a knife held to her throat. She thought the rut might not have been so bad after all. Morgan stays with friends and meets neighbor Nicholas Gregoras, who is wealthy, gorgeous and a tad mysterious. These two have romantic sparks flying between them from the beginning, while they're trying to figure out whom the bad guys are in the village, that kill on a whim. Is Nicholas the murderer/smuggler, is it Morgan's friends, or someone else?<br /><br />THE RIGHT PATH is one of Nora Roberts first romantic mysteries, and an excellent read!! I can't say the plot is completely unpredictable, but it has enough detours and twists to keep you very interested! The major problem is that this book is out of print and is VERY HARD TO FIND, but definitely worth seeking!	2005-05-20

THE CALHOUN WOMEN is actually two of Nora Roberts earlier books combined into one larger novel.<br /><br />The first story is about Lilah Calhoun, a botanical expert working in a preserve, who doesn't expend any more energy than necessary when doing anything in life! Then she finds Professor Max Quartermain drowning off of the beach where her family's house is located. She rescues him, and it's love at first sight! These total opposites try to figure out who tried to kill Max, and wonder if it has anything to do with the mystery of the lost emeralds that legend has attached to the ancestral home of Lilah.<br /><br />The other story is about Suzanna Calhoun, a divorced mother of two, who owns a nursery. She's struggling to make it on her own, and trying to patch the holes left in her heart from her ex-husband. In walks Holt Bradford who is attracted to Suzanna, but isn't used to stepping easily around issues, especially when they deal with an old mystery of lost jewels and unfaithful marriage partners.<br /><br />These stories are enchanting romances with mystery thrown in for good measure! The female characters are strong, but sensitive. The book made me laugh out loud a couple of times, sigh a few times, and nearly cry once. Nora Roberts has the readers on a rollercoaster that hits all emotions. A little on the predictable side, but definitely a great book!  Available in paperback, so definitely worth the price of admission!!	2005-05-20

This abuse caused her to develop multiple personalities. Now, she's accused of murdering her English professor, Allan Grant.  Laurie's sister, attorney Sarah Kenyon, has always felt guilty for her sister being kidnapped, and now comes to the rescue by being her defense attorney and brings in a psychiatrist to unlock the memories of her past.

US	51874804	R14FXNFBB62EJ7	0446364193	597792275	Along Came A Spider	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Another Winner for Patterson	ALONG CAME A SPIDER is the second Alex Cross book to revolve around the villain, Gary Soneji, a teacher at a private school in Washington DC. Soneji is also known as Son of Lindbergh, a murdering serial kidnapper that has outsmarted most of Washington's law enforcement. I also must say that Soneji is one of Patterson's most diabolical villains to date - he doesn't torture his victims the way we saw the villain in KISS THE GIRLS do, but he is much smarter and that can be very scary all by itself!<br /><br />Because of Soneji's brainpower, he's kept ahead of the law in the past. Now Alex Cross is on his trail and the going gets much more difficult for Soneji. Alex Cross is a homicide detective with a doctorate in psychology. Most of the readers can relate to this main character because he's an average guy, who's down to earth. In this book he does have one obsession - he is attracted to a female supervisor of Washington's Secret Service. Cross is determined to stop Soneji before his madness can kill another person and must work around the conflicting emotions set in place by his affair with another in law enforcement.<br /><br />ALONG CAME A SPIDER is definitely a great. Patterson's first book, KISS THE GIRLS was awesome, but this one is even better than the last! The reader can easily relate to the easy going, down-to-earth character of Alex Cross, who plays the piano when he's troubled, or enjoys playing with his children. I think the normalcy of this character helps draw the reader into the story, until you can't put it down. Patterson's villains seem to be created from a nightmare too terrible to remember. With this combination, Patterson is sure to stay on top of the bestseller's list!	2005-05-19

James Patterson is a master in grabbing the reader from page one and not letting go until the very end.  The Women's Murder Club books not only grasp you from the beginning, they never release you, leaving you anxiously awaiting the next installment that is months away from publication.  3RD DEGREE is no different.<br /><br />Lindsay Boxer is jogging with her buddy, assistant DA Jill Barnhardt.  Little does she know that her entire life will be tossed upside down in a matter of minutes.  She notices bruises on Jill's shoulder but before she can question her, a nearby townhouse blows up.  Lindsay rushes inside to save a child (ah, our heroine!), and the chase begins...<br /><br />Seems August Spies, a group of terrorists, is targeting greedy corporate executives and this attack is only the beginning.  Lindsay along with the other members of the Women's Murder Club is on a journey to stop them before the body count increases.  This time they have help from a hunky deputy directory of the Office of Homeland Security.  Yep, you guessed it, Joe Molinari and Lindsay are smitten.<br /><br />3RD DEGREE continues with excellent character growth and story development.  A difficult transaction takes place in this tale, as Patterson kills off one of the main characters.  I found it tough to understand his motive and am hoping in the next book we find out.  I'm wondering if the missing member will be replaced, or will the others be left to continually morn her passing.  Either way, it makes one wonder at Patterson's purpose.<br /><br />Could the changing of the make up of the Women's Murder Club be Patterson's downfall?  He could have at least waited a few more books like Cornwall did in her Scarpetta series.  Hey, maybe with enough complaints, Patterson will have the deceased rising from the dead just like Cornwell did!  We'll have to wait for a few more installments in this series before we have the answer to that question.<br /><br />Overall 3RD DEGREE is a very good book and a must read if you've been following along in this series.d book and a must read if you've been following along in this series.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-19

They were on opposite sites of the battlefield when it came to drinking in a saloon, but became friends when a small child needed their help and love. Together they found common ground and love bloomed.<br /><br />THE GAMBLE  is a great story - one of my favorite Spencer novels! Set back in the 1800's in Colorado, it is a typical western, with a little more flavor thrown in for good measure. Spencer writes a romantic story without going over the boundaries of propriety. This is a book that you could recommend to your mother or your grandmother, and not be embarrassed. Definitely enjoyable for all ages!	2005-05-19

THE STREET LAWYER is about Michael Brock who is doing everything that has always been expected of him. He's a lawyer for a huge law firm (Drake & Sweeney) where he bills an extortionate amount of hours, makes tons of money, and will soon be a partner. Then in a matter of a few minutes, his world comes crashing down around him. Michael becomes one of a homeless man's hostages in the firm's offices. After negotiations with the police falls through, they are all wondering if their lives have come to an end, but the homeless man is the one to lose his life. In doing so, Michael cannot forget what the man has said and begins digging deeper into the lives of the homeless. He's willing to throw all of his fortune away to help people and become the street people's lawyer. Then a secret is found out that could bring down Drake & Sweeney and lives have been lost to hold onto the secret. Now Michael's former partners are his enemies and only the reader will know the outcome after reading the last chapter.<br /><br />This has to be my personal favorite John Grisham book. I didn't think anything could be better than The Pelican Brief or The Firm, and then Grisham comes along with THE STREET LAWYER. This book will definitely keep you awake to finish that last chapter. Definitely a STOP LIGHT BOOK (the type of book that you pick up when the traffic light is red, just to read a couple of paragraphs!) - that's one of my highest ratings!	2005-05-19

He's barely making ends meet and has to exchange mowing lawns for his rent. His first case falls into his lap and it's a chance of a lifetime - an insurance company refuses to pay the medical treatments for a man dying of leukemia. Several problems face Rudy with this case, a few minor things like first passing the bar exam, getting together enough money to even try this case since he's flat broke, and getting the courage to go up against a huge corporation who just happens to have hired the best defense attorney around.<br /><br />John Grisham endures his characters to the reader and makes everyone think Insurance Companies are corrupt and only after profits.  THE RAINMAKER is one of those books that will have the reader cheering against Corporate America and wondering just how many times this type of atrocity has actually happened. Many of Grisham's books make you think about things in real life and wonder just how much is being covered up by big money corporations. This is definitely one of those adventures!<br /><br />THE RAINMAKER is another great book by this writer. Not as good as some of his earlier works, e.g. The Firm, The Pelican Brief, or A Time To Kill, but still a decent read and definitely worth the time spent. This is not one to keep you awake at night to finish, but it will keep you occupied, entertained, and wondering.	2005-05-19

It's his city, he grew up there, and he's determined to catch the person behind these crimes, as he feels it is the same person committing both of these horrendous crimes.<br /><br />With James Patterson there are no boundaries with his books. He takes you to the extreme edge of sanity and pushes just a little bit further, and then as you dangle over oblivion, he draws you back onto safe ground. His writings leave every nerve in your body frayed and jumping - what better way to judge a book! At times while reading JACK AND JILL, my heart rate speeded up and I found myself cheering for Alex Cross to finally figure out the killer's identity. Then there were other times I wasn't sure if I had pinpointed the right person behind the havoc.<br /><br />Patterson remains an expert at weaving a first class mystery and leaves nothing dangling in the balance at the end of the book! After reading each of his books, I wonder how he can write another one that is better than the last, but he continues to excel. But better yet, each of his villains is more horrific than the last!<br /><br />James Patterson books are definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you enjoy a good mystery and don't mind a few very graphic details, then you'll love this author!	2005-05-19

The killer knows she can see him, and uses that to his advantage - keeping her just out of range, but close enough to feel responsible for not stopping the killing of his next victim. He knows that she's watching him, he knows what she's thinking and doing, but more importantly, he knows that she's hot on his trail. She can see the murder weapon - a large knife with a gleaming steel blade, but why can't she see his face?  She's so close, but still far away. Until the very end, you'll be on the edge of your seat!<br /><br />THE VISION is a good book with glimpses of the unknown - Koontz shows us how a person who sees into the future can use her powers for good, and how those powers can be used against her in return.<br /><br />I enjoyed THE VISION but do have to admit that it was predictable for me. That could be because I'm an avid mystery reader (ok avid reader of many genres) and Koontz wrote the standard mystery type plot of giving clues to the identity of the bad guy, cover up those details by trying to confuse the issue, and then revealing the bad guy at the end. Even with my figuring out the villain, it was still a very enjoyable book!<br /><br />Definitely recommended reading!	2005-05-18

On a trip to visit her college roommate's family for the holidays, the unthinkable happens. A man with no conscience, one who fears nothing, one who has no remorse or limits (basically no soul) entered the house while they were sleeping. Chyna reacts in order to save herself and try to save her friend before it's too late.<br /><br />From this point, Koontz takes the reader on a journey into hell. There were times I wanted to stop reading this book because it was so nerve-wracking but I couldn't put it down for more than a few minutes. INTENSITY is the type of book that grabbed onto the reader and wouldn't let go!<br /><br />INTENSITY not only deals with the power of the characters, but leaves the reader feeling every nerve in their body until the finish and you won't be able to stop! INTENSITY is a definite page turner - you won't want to put it down. Just when you think you have things figured out, the plot twists and turns down an unexpected road.

These secrets can lead to the end of her marriage, but worse, it puts not only her life in danger, but also the lives of her two children.<br /><br />A CRY IN THE NIGHT has a great plot and could be summed up as a mother's worse nightmare come true. This book showcases why Mary Higgins Clark is one of America's best mystery writers of all time. This suspenseful tale will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Lots of twists and turns that will keep you guessing about what will happen next makes this one of my favorites.	2005-05-18

Wow	ICEBOUND is a little different story-line than Koontz' normal style and makes for a very interesting book. This is about a group of scientists in the Arctic working together to help the earth with their water shortage problem. This group must place bombs below the ice surface to get a large piece of ice dislocated from the mass, so it can be floated down to warmer climates, and be used for drinking water. Sounds simple, right ... wrong. Murphy's Law comes into effect. A member of the group turns out to be a psychopathic killer, an earthquake hits and makes returning to their home camp impossible, and after sixty bombs are placed and the timers set, a series of storms hit which make rescue seem impossible. Not only do they have to get off the ice cap, but also they have to figure out which one of them is the killer.<br /><br />ICEBOUND is a very suspenseful novel and an interesting diversion from the normal Koontz writing style. I found it very enjoyable, and a book even younger readers (pre-teens) can enjoy.	2005-05-18

Just for fun, Darcy talks Erin into helping a friend research the kinds of people who place personal ads. All is fun until Erin disappears and is found dead.

And, probably not the last, if he has anything to do with it. Next on his list is Darcy.<br /><br />LOVES MUSIC LOVES TO DANCE was the second book that I read written by Mary Higgins Clark, and this continued my addiction to her stories.

Mary Higgins Clark has taken this frightening idea and woven a tale around a young woman and a villain who creates the most deplorable of acts. This story escalates until the final climax which will leave your heart racing and have you wondering just how much of this tale can actually come true!<br /><br />Some may be asking what could I possibly mean by \\"every woman's worst nightmare\\", well let me give you a few hints without telling the entire story because you really should read this one!<br /><br />The villain in THE CRADLE WILL FALL is an obstetrician-gynecologist who entices women into his care by his track record on fertility. Women come to him with the hopes of fulfilling their dreams to have children. What they don't know is that he is conducting horrific experiments with them. His game begins to unravel when an Oriental child is born to a Caucasian couple. And then the truth becomes public knowledge. Women will empathize with the horror more than men, but I'm sure everyone will cringe at the truth when it is uncovered.<br /><br />THE CRADLE WILL FALL is definitely not one for younger readers and those who are faint of heart. The most ardent mystery lovers will enjoy this book because of it's terrifyingly real content. This is the first Mary Higgins Clark book that I ever read, and I was hooked from the first page. When I finished THE CRADLE WILL FALL, I went the very next morning to get another of her books. It is definitely unexpected, and completely absorbing. A+ material.	2005-05-18

It's a long tale, but you don't want it to end. I was so caught up in the story, that when it ended, I felt like family had moved on and there was an empty spot where they had been.<br /><br />Sandra Brown shows her expertise in drawing the reader into her mind. Get a cup of coffee or tea, curl up on the sofa, and ENJOY!	2005-05-17

A warning note was passed under Pat Traymore's door, which was a reminder of her past. As a television journalist and TV series producer, she knew instantly it was a warning. Her series on Senator Abigail Jennings, who was nominated as the first woman vice president of the United States seemed to be the center of the warning. With the aid of an old friend who happens to be a congressman (Sam Kingsley), Pat searches for clues as to why Abigail's life had gone this route. But in the process, the Senator's reputation and Pat's career could be on the line.<br /><br />STILLWATCH is a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat and entertained from the beginning until the end. Mary Higgins Clark is at the top of her writing game with this book.  There are a lot of twists and turns throughout this book, that keeps you guessing at all times.  Some may figure out the villain, and others won't, but all will agree that STILLWATCH should definitely be on everyone's Must Read list!	2005-05-17

She would never be the same again. Jade ran away as far and as fast as she could, vowing that some day she would evoke her revenge. She would never forget the town that turned it's back on her, or allowed these boys to get away with this hellacious crime. This was a company town dependent on one wealthy family, and she blamed them for their son and his two friends actions.  Years later Jade returns to find things are very different.  Even so she plots her way around and finds the real truth in the sleepy little town she used to call home.<br /><br />BREATH OF SCANDAL is a very well developed story. The beginning is a bit depressing, but then you see how Jade refuses to be beaten and her true spirit shines. Character development is excellent, and Sandra Brown evokes the perfect blend of characteristics to get the reader to empathize with Jade and cheer her on in her vendetta.  BREATH OF SCANDAL will make you take a hard look at things you think you see or know and try to find the true meanings behind the facades.	2005-05-17

Ok, I'll admit I thought that CARNAL INNOCENCE had a very strange title and didn't understand the implied reference until I was actually reading the book. Innocence in this case is actually a town in Mississippi. The main female character, Caroline Waverly, is a famous violinist who decides to go to Innocence, Mississippi to get away from a much-publicized break-up with her fianc&eacute;. She retreats to her family's quaintly charming old bayou home and begins to learn to relax and enjoy life, something she has never had the opportunity to do.<br /><br />What she doesn't know is that this town is full of deceptions and people hell-bent on revenge. When a murder victim is found, she begins to question her decision on moving to Innocence. Is the killer the one she's fallen in love with - charming, handsome Tucker Longstreet (ever notice how romance novels always have charming and handsome characters - no ugly, rude ones!). As Caroline tries to figure out her feelings while keeping out of harms way, many things come to light.<br /><br />CARNAL INNOCENCE is a very good book and definitely worth the price! It's full of suspense, romance, and unexpected twists and turns. I highly recommend reading this book, but make sure you have plenty of free time, because you won't want to put it down!	2005-05-17

I had struggled with the idea of wasting money on books required for each class and tried something a bit different when I took Visual Basic 6.  Instead of the required doorstop textbook, I purchased SAMS' TEACH YOURSELF VISUAL BASIC 6 IN 24 HOURS.  I was very happy with that decision!<br /><br />SAMS' TEACH YOURSELF VISUAL BASIC 6 IN 24 HOURS provides a good overview of Visual Basic and is definitely written for beginners.  Even with this agenda, not every menu item is shown so the reader feels like an idiot.  I found the answers to my questions easily and this book gave me a basic understanding of how VB works.  Examples of code provided in the book teach the reader to write code rather than have him/her following along with few brain cells needed.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, space is given to \\"Sprucing Up Programs\\" and glosses over more advance techniques using VB, like ActiveX controls.  In order to learn more advanced VB, a different book will be needed, as this one should be used for an overview and introduction only.<br /><br />The CD that accompanies this book will give the reader practice writing code.  Some of the items covered here are:  Labels, buttons, text boxes, controls and properties, message boxes, output boxes, looping, dialog boxes, printing, database basics, graphic image controls, and much more.<br /><br />During my Visual Basic class, my fellow students struggled using the standard text.  I breezed through my assignments and tests.  A few weeks into the class, one friend asked if he could look at my book.  After that, copies of SAMS' TEACH YOURSELF VISUAL BASIC 6 IN 24 HOURS started showing up and the standard text soon disappeared off many desks.  We all agreed it was a much better choice for our needs!<br /><br />SAMS' TEACH YOURSELF VISUAL BASIC 6 IN 24 HOURS is a great beginning source and will help the novice understand the basics.  It is not intended as a die-hard resource book, but an introduction into this powerful programming tool.nd will help the novice understand the basics.

When screenwriter Nash Kirkland wanted to research information on witches for his next horror movie, he went to a real one. Enters Morgana Donovan, a witch with a good reputation. But the problem for Nash is that he becomes obsessed with getting to know the real Morgana - her likes, dislikes, etc. Has she put a love spell on him or has he taken the plunge on his own? He's sure it's a spell, because he's never felt like this before. Would his doubts in her character ruin any chance at happiness that they might have?<br /><br />CAPTIVATED is a wonderful story that will leave the reader feeling great after reading that last page. It's a true \\"feel good\\" tale. It's definitely worth the price of purchase.  It's also a good thing that the publishing house reprinted this with the other stories of the Donovan Legacy, as they were very difficult to find before the reprint.	2005-05-17

Sandra Brown's cross from the romance genre into mystery has been an excellent move in my opinion.  Of the many authors who have made this switch, she is one of the best!<br /><br />In WHITE HOT, Sayre Lynch returns to Destiny, LA for her brother Danny's funeral.  Even though she's not had contact with her family for over ten years, she is tossed into the middle of a minefield, some of which is her own doing.  Huff, her father, is still the same egotistical, domineering person he always has been.  He continues to run his foundry with an iron fist, and dares union reps and government officials to try to make him change the way he does business.  Chris, Sayre's brother, is his father's yes-man.  The sad part is that he's been spoiled by Huff and in growing up in this environment has been corrupted into Huff's way of thinking.  Beck Merchant, Chris' college buddy, and now legal counsel to Hoyle Enterprises, is just like a member of the family and his level of corruption is often at the center of debate between he and Sayre.<br /><br />As Sayre says a final farewell to Danny at the grave, she meets his fianc&eacute;e and begins to doubt that her brother committed suicide.  This begins the journey into corruption, self indulgence, and a good old fashion \\"who dun it\\" that at times leaves the reader just as breathless as those in Destiny trying to endure a heat wave.  Between the accidents at the foundry, the union strike, the attacks by a local reprobate (Slap Watkins), flying sparks between Beck and Sayre, and other incidences the reader isn't given a chance to relax!<br /><br />Character development is excellent, as usual for Brown.  Sayre lives up to her redhead temperament, and her bouts with Beck will make the reader chuckle, and also feel the electricity between the two.  A bit predictable, we are not surprised when Sayre and Beck give in to temptation and begin an affair.<br /><br />Being fooled very seldom as to the villain's identity, Brown did have me wondering if I was correct in my choice.  She confused the issue right up until the last 20 pages, and the twist left me smiling and being thoroughly entertained!  But a few of the loose ends that she tied up were not a surprise even if they were extremely minor!<br /><br />Overall, WHITE HOT was fast paced, action packed, and full of life.  The story had life, as well as the characters.

But when the police start asking for an alibi because of a fire at the family business, Lucky was even more desperate to find her.

SILKEN WEB has to be one of the most romantic, sexually graphic and tantalizing books that I've read by Sandra Brown. This is the story of Kathleen who marries Seth, a rich man who can give her everything, except what she needs in bed (figures, huh?). Then Erik comes into the picture - Erik, who has women tumbling in and out of his bed, but would never think about marriage. SILKEN WEB is based on the decision Kathleen has to make - which man will she ultimately chose?<br /><br />I'm surprised that SILKEN WEB doesn't combust into flames on the shelf! This is definitely not for a pre-teen to read. SILKEN WEB could induce the reader to take several cold showers and be considered a heavy breather while reading! Sexually graphic scenes are meant to arouse the reader, and Sandra Brown shows the world that her books can be hot!	2005-05-13

SHADOWS OF YESTERDAY is an interesting journey but it left unanswered questions for me. Sandra Brown introduces us to Leigh who is stranded with a broken car and is about to give birth to her first baby. Naturally, a gorgeous stranger comes to her rescue and delivers the baby. Sounds like this storyline has been done before, but Brown throws some fascinating kinks into the old story line. She mixes and matches the standard romance plots and pairs them into her story to suit her own style. SHADOWS OF YESTERDAY may start out like many you've read before, but it usually doesn't end there with Sandra Brown.<br /><br />This is a feel good story - perilous situation, dashing man comes to rescue the damsel in distress, and the evil witch comes to ruin a happy situation. Ah, but there are surprises along the way that keep SHADOWS OF YESTERDAY interesting and not dull!  Enjoy being swept away for the time being and imagine yourself as the damsel in distress or the knight in the pick up truck (umm, I mean on the white charger).	2005-05-13

TIGER PRINCE is a story about Caren Blakemore who goes on vacation to Jamaica to stop thinking about her trying job and a recent divorce. There she meets Derek Allen who is also avoiding the real world. They have what they determine is a fantasy affair, and think they will each go their own ways at the end of the vacation. Then Derek's secrets draw Caren into an international problem with little room to avoid a public scandal.<br /><br />TIGER PRINCE is a decent story, but very unsurprising. Characters are not as strongly developed as in Sandra Brown's later books. She originally wrote this one under the pseudonym of Erin St. Claire, and I've found that the books written under that name are not as dynamic and strongly defined as those written under the name of Sandra Brown. It's a fair way of spending a few hours but I wouldn't drop everything to read it!	2005-05-13

She's sure an interview with a retired US General in Texas will get that job for her if she can reveal his reason for the self-imposed seclusion. The only thing she has trouble with is his son, Lyon Ratiff. The anger, suspicion and uneasiness leads to love.  Wow, does anything not lead to love with Sandra Brown?<br /><br />PRIME TIME has a good story line, but nothing surprising in the plot line. The characters are strong but not as developed as they could be. If more depth were given to the characters, it may have led to a few twists and turns that were unexpected and would keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat!.

You have Cat Delaney who has a new heart and a TV show she's always wanted to do - a show about children with special needs. She meets an ex-cop who now writes books and together they begin a journey to find out why other heart transplant patients are being killed.<br /><br />The storyline is not new, but the way Sandra Brown tells this story is great! When I was reading it I was laughing, crying and then immediately trying to figure out who could possibly be the villain. This book is much better than Brown's earlier attempts at mixing romance and mystery, but not as terrific as her later books. The more Sandra Brown writes, the better her stories become! If you've never read any of her books, I suggest that you start with the ones written about 1994 or later - they are definitely great parables.	2005-05-13

Even as a child Maddie was a graceful dancer who could learn new routines at the drop of a hat (as seen with a few well placed flash backs and remembrance scenes in this book). A guest appearance from Frank O'Hurley, the patriarch of the talented family and a flamboyant character himself, shows us that his goal has always been to enjoy life and live vicariously through the fame of his children. His appearances are always a welcome detour from the main plot.<br /><br />In the typical genre of romance books, this love story is far from a smooth ride but is an enjoyable journey along a bumpy road filled with characters you'll never forget. Unfortunately, the story line is not as unforgettable as those in it!	2005-05-13

He needed her to make him stop running and be a man again.

They are hiding from secret pasts, but soon find that they can't deny the sparks that surround them when they're alone. The past is hot on their heels, and each worry about the newfound love being destroyed by their separate pasts.<br /><br />SUNSET EMBRACE is a story set in the 1800's and is followed by ANOTHER DAWN. This type of writing is not the Sandra Brown norm, but is a very nice diversion. She brings this era alive, and makes the reader see and feel the story.

The government announces that 26 men have been found, alive. She's torn between hope that her husband is one of those men, and longing for a new love that she's just found.<br /><br />This is a pleasant enough way to spend some free time in which you don't want to think and \\"veg out\\". There's nothing in TOMORROW'S PROMISE that will get your mind moving, or your blood pressure up for that matter. This is an ok story line, but it leaves you feeling like it's Brown's rough draft and not the final book. There's room for many subplots, stronger character definition, etc., but she falls short of this being a spectacular book. Because of the cookie-cutter plot line, the story is very predictable, and leaves little to the imagination.

The characters are built-up to almost dynamic, but Brown stops before she gets them there. If you stop reading at certain key points and let your mind wander, you can fill in the blanks that Sandra Brown has left.

I found myself emphasizing with Kendall Deaton as she runs from a car wreck with her baby and was trying to encourage her on her way (\\"no, not there, ok get in the car and go...\\"). Kendall was a public defender in a small town in South Carolina and stumbled across the town's dirty laundry. Her life became miserable, and the only way to save her life and that of her child's is to run.<br /><br />THE WITNESS is a mystery first with romance thrown into the plot for good measure! And good measure it is!! You'll find yourself out of breath while trying to help Kendall run and smiling when she stumbles into the arms of a very romantic man. Hot and steamy love scenes, done tastefully, leave the reader believing that romance really does exist. I can't say enough about THE WITNESS, except that you'll be hooked from the first page, and then not want to turn that last page and have it end. This book is one of Brown's best!	2005-05-13

It's a little on the predictable side with Brown keeping within the boundaries set for romance books years before.

The main female character, Sloan Fairchild, is devastated by her past love life and throws herself into the running of her bed-and-breakfast inn in San Francisco. Her best friend sends her fiance Carte Madison to Sloan's inn to finish his book before their wedding. Can you guess what happens? Yep, they meet, fall in love, try to ignore their feelings for one another, make love, and then try to deny it all for friendship's sake. The key word being \\"try\\".<br /><br />This story line has been done a million times, and would be boring if Brown didn't thrown in her own special story development. I'd suggest that she needs to figure out some new themes, but most of her early books seem to take the standard romance stories and enhance them. In my opinion, she has gotten much better and more interesting in the last few years when she's crossed from a romance writer into the romance/mystery genre.<br /><br />BREAKFAST IN BED is better than a lot of stuff out there, but absolutely not one of Brown's best attempts! BREAKFAST IN BED is fun and can have you leave the real world behind for a few minutes at a time. So if you need to escape life, this is an amiable way to do it!	2005-05-13

The copyright is 1983, so it was written before all of the surrogate moms and stalking stories. If you take that into account, then it's a good read, but still very bizarre.<br /><br />The main female character, Arden Gentry, comes across as weak and spineless. The reader feels sorry for her since she lost her son, Joey. But then the reader feels as if she needs to check into a psychiatric facility when she becomes obsessed on finding the child she gave up at birth because of an overbearing, horrible husband that she finally gets the nerve to divorce. My opinion of the divorce was that it came too late to prevent permanent emotional damage to Arden, but that remains to be seen. Arden sets out to find the child she gave up and the father of that child.<br /><br />I personally didn't like A SECRET SPLENDOR. I'm sure it was supposed to be sweet and show the caring side of a mother who can't forget the child she gave up. Instead it came across as a woman who is obsessive and compulsive, besides being very competent at lying. Someone who schemes to be a part of the child's life again doesn't deserve to live happily-ever-after. That should be reserved for someone who is honest!	2005-05-13

Dynamic characters and fantastic plot lines with subplots tossed in to keep you off guard and thoroughly entertained are the reasons behind this favorite selection!<br /><br />Schyler Crandall is the adopted daughter of the richest man in the small town of Heaven (thus the book title). She had run away years before when her sister stole her fianc&eacute; in a scandalous affair. When she returns, she runs into Cash the mysterious man of town. Tricia and Ken, her sister and ex-fianc&eacute; are still around to give Schyler additional grief, even though they are now married and miserable together. Thrown in for good measure is Jigger the town pimp and hooligan. All of these formidable characters together make for a terrific story.<br /><br />Schyler is brought back to Heaven by a crisis and she enters a family conflict, while the family business is about to go under, and she also becomes involved with many other troubles she can't foresee. She also can't predict the love that awaits her just around the corner.<br /><br />SLOW HEAT IN HEAVEN is a book that will keep you jumping from one thing to another, and will make it almost impossible for you to put it down. Everything comes to a stop in your life when you start to read this one! If you like to be surprised, and enjoy romance, mystery, revenge, etc., then this is the book for you!!	2005-05-10
US	51874804	R1M86TMAB2SKFP	0553294903	56990008	Divine Evil	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Divine Book!	Artist Clare Kimball returns to her hometown to try to figure out the nightmares that have always invaded her sleep only to find things pretty much as they were when she left. There is one significant change that is noticeable - bad boy Cameron Rafferty is now the local sheriff.<br /><br />As one of the few who mix romance and mystery perfectly, Nora Roberts has another winner with DIVINE EVIL. The villain in this story had this bibliophile fooled until almost the end! I was so caught up in the entwining of personalities and players, that I didn't see this one coming. I won't tell you if it was the obvious or the least palpable or someone in the middle, but I will say that this is one of my all time favorites!<br /><br />Evil takes on a new definition in this tale that is so reprehensible that no one would think something like this would live in a small town like Emmitsboro. Roberts weaves into the story of Clare Kimball the unexplained bizarre death of her father from years before. The reader isn't sure if this is part of the evil or an excellent attempt to throw you off the track of the evildoers. The great part of DIVINE EVIL is the subplots designed to keep the reader off guard until you're hit upside the head with the truth. Toss in romance to give the reader a chance to catch your breath, and it's the formula for a best-selling novel.	2005-05-10

An interesting tale about Margo Sullivan who had visions of grandeur but wouldn't let her dreams die. She grew up in Monterey, California in a mansion. She was treated like a family member, but was actually the daughter of the housekeeper. Her mother tried to keep Margo's feet on the ground, but it didn't work. She went on to have a successful modeling career until scandal ruined it and caused her to go bankrupt, but she continued to dream. She retreats to her hometown and back into the friendship with Kate and Laura, her two childhood friends who grew up in the same house with her.<br /><br />Sound like a normal romance - it is up until the first few pages, then it has jumps and turns that are very unexpected. Margo ends up talking her buddies into a business venture that saves each of them from the ghosts that hound them.<br /><br />One thing that is interesting is that the running of the business is not glamorized and is shown as very hard work, but still enjoyable. This runs more along the real lines of actual life than fantasy, but has a dose of \\"real life\\" now and then for good measure.<br /><br />DARING TO DREAM is a very enjoyable book. The only trilogy that I liked better than this one was the Born In series!	2005-05-10

PROOF is a terrific story about wine merchant Tony Beach who seems to stumble into one tragic situation after another. He agrees to cater a party for the horseracing elite, and watches as hit men reek havoc on the party. Now he's caught in the middle of a terrifying mystery that begins with counterfeit wine and continues on to murder. He has to dig deep within to continue to have the courage to find out who and why this is happening.<br /><br />Dick Francis is a great writer of mysteries that always revolve around horseracing life. Most of his stories are based in England and steeple chasing (not the type of horseracing we're used to here in the United States). They are interesting and educational if you know nothing about this sport. Francis does not write tales as intense as some of the American authors do, but they are definitely worth the time to read. My father got me hooked on Dick Francis and his tales of murder and mayhem, and this author will have his books read for many years. They are timeless!	2005-05-10

Her son's inheritance is the ranch where they live with Anna's father-in-law.  Carl Herbold is the bad guy who enjoys being bad and excels at it! Carl was serving a life sentence in an Arkansas prison, but escapes with another inmate and vows to carry out his revenge. He's on the way to Texas, and Anna Corbett is in the center of Carl's plans. Along comes Jack Sawyer, an easygoing cowboy who keeps his past a mystery and hires on to help on the ranch.  His real intentions are to protect Anna and her son. What he didn't know is that he'd fall in love with Anna and her son, and protecting them both became more important than life itself!<br /><br />UNSPEAKABLE is a great book! One of Sandra Brown's best stories yet! Again Brown mixes romance and mystery with the perfect blend. If you've never read any of Sandra Brown's work, this would be an excellent one from which to start! UNSPEAKABLE has many twists and turns to leave you wondering what will happen next.

If Nora Roberts is the author, then the answer is always \\"PLENTY\\"! Eve hand picks a young female biographer to help write the book and unwittingly endangers all of the people involved.<br /><br />GENUINE LIES touches on the Hollywood lifestyle, the glitzy lifestyle of Beverly Hills, what some people will do to keep secrets unknown, betrayal and of course romance.<br /><br />This was one of the first times Nora Roberts crossed the genre line from romance to mystery and does a very decent job of it. She excels in this quest in her later more recent books, but this one could be given a grade of B.<br /><br />As with most of her novels, Roberts throws in the unexpected and leaves the readers wanting more when they've finished reading the last page of GENUINE LIES!	2005-05-10

NIGHT SMOKE is one of Nora Roberts earlier ventures into the mystery genre and she does it very well. Even with her mysteries, you have very vivid and romantic characters, which, in my opinion, add much color to the story.<br /><br />Ryan Piasecki (I'd love to know how she comes up with these names!) is an arson investigator who just happens to be drop dead gorgeous. He's the epitome of every woman's ideal of the perfect man: athletic, gorgeous, sensitive, etc. Natalie Fletcher (ever notice how Roberts combines romantic entities of common names with uncommon?) owns her own business and is battling with an unknown arsonist who is determined to put her out of business. If you're an avid mystery enthusiast, then you'll have absolutely no trouble figuring out the villain in this tale! Otherwise, you may be surprised.<br /><br />The suspense isn't the greatest, but when Roberts combines the romantic aspects of the story with the ambiguity of the arson investigation, it becomes a very good tale. NIGHT SMOKE is not as spectacular as her latest mysteries, but comes in a close second to them!	2005-05-10

ONE MAN'S ART is not about true MacGregors, but extended family.  And of course Daniel MacGregor enjoys his role of matchmaker so much and is so efficient in that function, he's not above sharing his skills with extended family.<br /><br />Any time I hear that a book is about Nora Roberts' MacGregors, I can't wait to read it, knowing that it will be a hit! ONE MAN'S ART is a little different, although still a very good romance, but gives a little less than the actual stories revolving around the MacGregors.<br /><br />This is the story of Genevieve Grandeau and Grant Campbell, brother to the Campbell married to Alan.  There are not many twists and turns as usually indicated by Daniel MacGregor's involvement, but more on the average and predictable side.  The background and scenic area are more interesting than the story line and with Roberts' descriptions you can actually see the seascape and feel the ocean spray.<br /><br />Overall ONE MAN'S ART isn't a very exciting story, but better than most!	2005-05-10

This tale is about a cop at the end of his rope. Burke Basile feels that he's the reason his partner is dead, his marriage is over, and his career is over, so he focuses his revenge on his main enemy, Pinkie Duvall, a lawyer who helps killers get away with murder. Burke plans the ultimate revenge - he plans on kidnapping Remy, the lawyer's beautiful wife. What he doesn't know is how desperate this woman is and how she is trying to get out of the loveless marriage to Pinkie, but is instead a prisoner in her own home. Burke plans a daring plot that has him inside Pinkie's mansion for a Mardi Gras masquerade party on Fat Tuesday, but didn't consider his love-at-first-sight feelings for Remy.<br /><br />FAT TUESDAY is a highly charged story in which Sandra Brown proves that she can cross the line of romance writer into the genre of mystery. This is one of my favorite books by her, and I consider it a \\"stop light book\\" (one that you have on the seat when you're driving, and while at a stop light, you read a paragraph or two - you definitely can't put this book down). This is filled with romance, wicked attempts of possessing another human being, and suspense.	2005-05-10

I've read numerous Linda Howard books and realized this was my least favorite about halfway through the story.  DREAM MAN lacked the normal zing and fervor in which she usually brings to the written page.<br /><br />Marlie Keen is an empath, a type of psychic, who is uncomfortable in revealing her powers to anyone, thus keeping everyone at a distance.  Six years ago, she endured a killer's attempted revenge, only to be traumatized to the point of having no powers.  When these return, she is thrown into mind of a vicious killer.  After going to the police, she is doubted and considered an accomplice.  Once her alibi is verified, Detective Dane Hollister gives in to his instant attraction.<br /><br />When Marlie has another vision, she calls Dane, who immediately rushes to her side.  After witnessing the trauma a vision causes Marlie, he is determined to protect her at all costs.  He moves into her home and invades all aspects of her life.  Invades and conquers... it was more like a Viking domineering his woman.<br /><br />The problem right from the start of this book is Dane's incredible attraction to Marlie.  They argue and act like children who are attracted to each other.  When Dane decides that he wants to be involved with her, he snaps his fingers and expects Marlie to fall in line.  At this point, she loses her spunk and becomes a dishrag doll happy to be the obedient girlfriend.  The strong character the reader is introduced to is snuffed out and replaced with a shell.<br /><br />The story lags when Marlie and Dane are not on the trail of the serial killer.  We're given hot and steam sex scene after sex scene, with little intellectual meat.  Basically if Marlie isn't having a vision of the killer stalking and/or slashing his next victim, she's tossed into bed by Dane and expected to perform.<br /><br />DREAM MAN is definitely not high on my reading list.  I'd much rather read MR. PERFECT or KILL AND TELL.  This is an average book that isn't up to the usual excellence of Linda Howard.the usual excellence of Linda Howard. <br />	2005-05-09

FIRESTORM does not disappoint and is chocked full of suspense and intrigue, with an added cerebral exercise thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Kerry Murphy is an arson investigator who spent two years in a coma after losing her mother to a house fire when she was a child.  When she awakes, she has acquired new abilities, which she keeps to herself.  Her partner Sam, an arson dog obtained from an animal shelter, is actually a cover for her psychic ability to sense fires.  Her life is going along fine until Brad Silver enters the picture.  Brad's brother, a US Senator, has a very angry enemy who torches his limousine, as he and his wife leave their townhouse for a Washington DC function.  Brad has vowed revenge and is determined to find the villain behind this senseless act.<br /><br />Brad also has psychic abilities, although a bit different than Kerry's.  Brad is known as a \\"controller\\" and can go into others' minds and manipulate their thinking.  Brad asks for Kerry's help in finding James Trask, the person he believes is behind his brother's murder.  Trask was part of the Defense Department's secret project - remote-controlled firestorms.<br /><br />It's an interesting concept.  You can disintegrate your enemies with little effort; Armageddon projected to only a selected group.  Since Trask is angry his pet project was stopped, he continues with research and experimentation while vowing revenge on those that attempted to stop the project.  Kerry Murphy and Brad Silver are the only two who can stop him.<br /><br />Johansen puts two strong-willed characters together, along with a great support cast.  Kerry refuses to help Silver until the madman torches her brother's home.  Then she agrees but doesn't give in to protect her family, but she refuses to his demonstrative ways.  She holds her own, which is part of the charm of this book.  I love the strong characters Johansen creates!<br /><br />FIRESTORM is full of action, has incredible character development, and leaves the reader wondering if psychics can actually invade your mind and change how you perceive a scene.  Ok, so it might be a stretch, but it was definitely interesting.  FIRESTORM rates up there with some of my favorite books produced by this author, and I'd be hard pressed to say which I enjoyed more: UGLY DUCKLING, AND THEN YOU DIE, or FIRESTORM!ters Johansen creates! <br /> <br />FIRESTORM is full of action, has incredible character development, and leaves the reader wondering if psychics can actually invade your mind and change how you perceive a scene.

If you enjoy Patricia Cornwell's medical examiner books and have trouble being patient until her next book is available in bookstores, then you're gonna love Kathy Reich. Her heroine is a medical anthropologist (one who studies bones - long dead bones), but she too gets involved with capturing a serial killer who's run amuck in Canada.<br /><br />DEJA DEAD is Reich's first book and it's excellent.  It keeps the reader entertained from the very first page until the last one. In my reading experience, 1st books are usually mediocre at best, but Reich breaks out of that rating. DEJA DEAD does give the necessary background information on the characters, but does so without being mundane and boring. You have sparks flying between detectives and personnel in the medical examiner's office, which I'm anticipating exploring in future books!<br /><br />DEJA DEAD leaves the reader wanting to pick up Reich's next book immediately. Graphic descriptions, edge of your seat action and a cerebral exercise makes this \\"who dun it\\" a highly recommended read.	2005-05-09

But was it enough to stop someone from trying to destroy their first project together?

Serena MacGregor is a red-gold haired angel face with a personality of a wildcat, but that didn't deter Brigham Langston. This romantic story is filled with love, laughs, war and rivalry.<br /><br />As typical Nora Roberts' style, the reader can really \\"see\\" the Scottish highlands and feel the emotions of the characters as Roberts brings them to life. Very descriptive and emotional, REBELLION leaves nothing to the readers' imagination regarding how the main players feel or think.<br /><br />I originally read REBELLION after I had read several of the MacGregor books and enjoyed comparing Daniel to his Aunt Serena. They are both full of life, and eager to share their joy with others, but you'll always know exactly where you stand with either of them. I wouldn't want to get on either of their bad side. They are the types that would make bitter enemies, or fervent friends, and their antics are enjoyable when told by Roberts!<br /><br />Don't miss this book - the one that started it all!	2005-05-06

If he can also figure out why MJ has a diamond the size of a tennis ball, it would be an added bonus.<br /><br />Of course sparks are gonna fly between these two dynamic personalities which adds a lot of flavor to this story!<br /><br />As CAPTIVE STAR ends, you're left craving more - wanting to find out the rest of the story. Luckily, Roberts picks up the tale in the next book, SECRET STAR.<br /><br />A fantastic trilogy that I highly recommend! These are \\"feel good\\" books with lots of romance and a little bit of mystery thrown in for balance!	2005-05-06
US	51874804	R1U2MJ7SZSNL55	0553279912	198755712	A Is for Alibi (A Kinsey Millhone Mystery)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Not an A, but rather a C	I was first introduced to Sue Grafton and her alphabet mysteries with her book D IS FOR DEADBEAT and was hooked. I then looked for the previous books to \\"catch up\\". I have to admit, that if I had read A IS FOR ALIBI first, I probably would have read another, but not been in such a hurry.<br /><br />A IS FOR ALIBI is a good first book, but is nothing compared to her later tomes in her continuing career. The reader is introduced to Kinsey Millhone but doesn't get the full impact of Kinsey's strong character and inventive mind until later books. In A IS FOR ALIBI, Kinsey is an average private detective struggling to make ends meet. That's an ok premise, but when we meet the real Kinsey, the reader can't help but relate to her and fall in love with her spunkiness!<br /><br />And then there's Henry! This is a man that everyone wants as a landlord - he's not a nosey neighbor, he's caring, intelligent (he does the crossword puzzles in ink!), and just an all around wonderful guy. And when he's in his kitchen baking bread, the reader can almost smell it, and your mouth begins to water just imagining it. But then again, we don't really meet Henry until later in the series.<br /><br />This book will give you the basic facts you'll eventually need if you continue reading Sue Grafton's alphabet series, but have the next couple of books there to read immediately after you finish this one so this won't turn you off of the series.<br /><br />Overall this is an average book, but you can be reassured that it's worth the time spent reading it because of the later books!	2005-05-06

The STARS OF MITHRA series deals with three best friends: Bailey James, MJ O'Leary and Grace Fontaine. All three are childhood friends and would trust each other with their lives, and this is just about what happens in this succession of books!<br /><br />SECRET STAR is the ending to this series and what a terrific ending it is! Grace Fontaine is the other friend trusted with a huge diamond that is part of the Three Stars of Mithra. Grace is a beautiful, elegant heiress that isn't about to let anyone push her around. Seth Buchanan is a lieutenant with the local police and they run into each other at Grace's mansion that has been ransacked and her cousin murdered because of her resemblance to Grace. Now comes the twists and turns in this one! Grace and Seth try to tie up all of the loose ends in this murder mystery while reuniting the three diamonds. Of course love has it's place with this couple as well as the in the other two books in this series.<br /><br />The first two books are fantastic bringing the reader along in a ride filled with my mystery, fun and romance. They're well written and keep you reading from the first page until the last. When you get to this last book, Nora Roberts appears too busy tying up all of the loose ends to charm the reader with the magic and entertainment found in the other two books. She does a great job ending everything, but SECRET STAR is not as all encompassing as HIDDEN STAR or CAPTIVE STAR.<br /><br />All in all, this is a terrific trilogy full of humor, mystery and romance. Nora Roberts' talent shines with these tales!	2005-05-06

Bad girl Jean Tiberlake was killed and her ex-boyfriend, Bailey Fowler, convicted of her murder. After seventeen years in prison, he escapes. Kinsey Millhone is hired to find the killer. The catch: Is the killer Fowler or someone else?<br /><br />Typical Grafton style in this book, you won't know who the real killer is until the end. Sue Grafton not only keeps you on the edge of your seat, but has you second-guessing yourself when you think you've figured it all out.<br /><br />Surprises abound in this book, from the unknown dangers, to the love and caring shown to Kinsey by her buddy Henry! Everyone should have a friend like Henry! I can't say enough good things about F IS FOR FUGITIVE without giving away all of the little curves Grafton throws at you in this book. Suffice it to say, it's absolutely wonderful!!<br /><br />If you want to read a book that will make your heart race, make you take the book everywhere with you until you're finished - this is the one for you!	2005-05-06

It shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men, and a strong sensitive male that isn't afraid to dream.<br /><br />This is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter and their families. The families run into each other while treasure-hunting for Angelique's Curse - a treasure that has eluded everyone, and many think it is only a myth. But this artifact is worth everything to some, even worth killing another.<br /><br />As this joint expedition continues, it holds all of the elements needed for a great story: mystery, romance, secrets that can't be shared, deceptions and threats. There are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader isn't sure which avenue Nora Roberts will take until she delivers them to it. This always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and gives you a first hand \\"view\\" of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue.<br /><br />I highly recommend THE REEF and only wish it would have continued - or at least had a sequel in the works! Great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning. One of Nora Roberts better works!	2005-05-06

Usually the client dies somewhere during the investigation instead of at the beginning. Leave it up to Sue Grafton to make a u-turn away from the norm, and the readers love it!<br /><br />In C IS FOR CORPSE Kinsey meets a guy at a gym who is trying to rehabilitate himself after a life threatening car accident in which his Porsche was forced over a cliff. Standard criteria applies to this story: He has no memory of the accident, doesn't know why someone would want to kill him, and he feels like someone is watching him and will try again. Kinsey agrees to help, and then he is killed.<br /><br />This is the first time we get a glimpse at the loyalty that is synonymous with Kinsey Millhone. Even though her client is dead, she's determined to find his killer, after all she had agreed to do the job and that's her goal. Grafton takes us on the journey and the pace is excellent. She keeps you intrigued until the last page and you understand that these mysteries are something that you will continue to read	2005-05-06

Sue Grafton is beginning to find her niche with the mix of subplots. B IS FOR BURGLAR has a missing widow with a lynx coat, a burned house, a break-in at the widow's apartment, a dead bridge partner and the lynx coat returning without the owner.<br /><br />Besides having Kinsey flying from Santa Teresa (which is very similar to Santa Barbara in descriptions, etc.) to Florida and back again, we get caught up in the trail and scenarios of who is the villain and what actually has happened to Elaine, the widow with the expensive coat! But the best part is a little bit more of a glimpse as to who Kinsey Millhone really is and why she intrigues the average reader! If I had to choose one thing that Sue Grafton does well, it's her character development. You relate with the characters and you can get an immediate feeling of either liking them or knowing that they're up to no good!<br /><br />Still not as good as her latest books, but definitely worth reading!!	2005-05-06

In RIVER'S END, Nora Roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years: A story of Hollywood's glamour gone astray, and the young girl who survived it. But this isn't a typical plot by any means, not with Roberts' doing the writing. She guarantees many unexpected events along the way!<br /><br />The tale of a pair of Hollywood stars living the life many only dream of living, a young child who can grow up to have it all, until murder and mayhem reeks havoc in their lives. The mother is dead and the father is in jail, and Olivia, the little girl who had it all, is forced to forget it all in order to save her own sanity.<br /><br />Olivia is raised by her grandparents in the Pacific Northwest and has been shielded from her past until those events are once again brought to the headlines when her father is released from prison. A young writer, Noah Brady, is the son of the investigating police officer to this crime and he wants to tell the story that no one has been allowed to hear.<br /><br />Noah digs up long buried ghosts and stirs the pot to bring the monsters back. With her father out of prison and revenge on the killer's mind, you have to wait until the end of the book until many subplots are solved. Was her mother's killer her father or someone else? Who is the monster that wants this story buried and never told? Can Olivia and Noah's love survive this ordeal?<br /><br />As an avid mystery lover, and a Nora Roberts' fan, I have to say that she just keeps getting better and better. This one almost had me fooled (very few actually do fool me), and I was second-guessing my idea of the villain until almost the end.	2005-05-06

Should be simple, right? Not with Sue Grafton writing the book!!  When Kinsey's retainer check bounces things really start to get interesting!! Next Kinsey finds the deadbeat who wrote the check, he was dead. Now she has to find out who killed him in order to get paid!<br /><br />This is the first Sue Grafton book that I read and I was hooked after reading it. It's exciting and keeps a fast pace so you're never in danger of becoming bored. The plot is well developed, as are the characters. We see more into the personalities that make up not only Kinsey, but Henry the landlord as well. If Kinsey were older or Henry younger, you might see some romantic sparks fly - but that's not in the future, only a deep friendship.<br /><br />Grafton also starts expanding the supporting cast of characters with a glimpse at Rosie, the Hungarian diner owner down the street. The people Grafton writes about are all flamboyant in their own ways.<br /><br />Definitely a great book to spend some time with, but make sure you have the next book (E IS FOR EVIDENCE) ready to pick up as soon as you read the last page of this one - you won't want to stop reading!	2005-05-06

We first met Federica Kimball when her father married Natasha Stanislaski in TAMING NATASHA. At that time she was an adorable 5-year-old with a smile that could melt a heart. Her aunt, Rachel Stanislaski, becomes involved with a rugged bar owner and his nephew, Nicholas LeBeck, who was trying to be a juvenile delinquent, until Rachel was assigned his case.<br /><br />Years later Freddie decides that Nick has had enough time to realize that she's not a child anymore. Nick has always thought of Freddie as a kid sister, but she's about to make that stop! They're extended family, and extended family isn't supposed to have these types of feelings for each other!<br /><br />WAITING FOR NICK is a fun filled romantic story that is still enjoyable even though it's predictable. Strong family values are evident in Nora Roberts' books, and this is no exception. Not a brain exercise, but definitely one of those feel good books that are a pleasurable way to spend a few hours.	2005-05-06
US	51874804	RQB26J2JK8Z7I	0394579828	650435497	"E" Is for Evidence	Books	4	1	1	N	N	E Words Abound!	Evidence is the key word in E IS FOR EVIDENCE, from evidence planted to implement another, to lost evidence, etc. Grafton likes E words because there are lots of them in here to accompany evidence: We have ex-lovers, evasions, enemies, exoneration and endings.<br /><br />Wow, are you as confused as I was when reading the back of this book?? My advice is not to read the back and just jump right in to it! This is the book where we see that Kinsey Millhone is not a super woman action figure, but can go through the normal garbage that we all experience. Except with Kinsey it's on a much grander scale. E IS FOR EVIDENCE tells a little of Kinsey's background, that she's thirty-two and had been married twice and divorced twice, used to be a cop, doesn't have many close friends (except for Henry) and usually takes the case of the underdog.<br /><br />Grafton delves more into the personality behind her heroine and lets the reader see more of the real Kinsey Millhone, but so as not to bore you, she also brings us closer to Henry and others with glimpses into their homes and lives.<br /><br />Another winner for Grafton!	2005-05-06

Gabe's brother had died a few months before and he felt that he needed time alone to sort out his emotions. The perfect place for him to be secluded and enable him to try and paint once again was at his cabin. The solitude was disrupted when a pregnant Laura wrecks her car and Gabe rescues her.<br /><br />Nora Roberts then throws in the typical story line of them falling in love, marrying moments (and I do mean moments) before the baby is born, etc. As typical Nora Roberts' style, GABRIEL'S ANGEL doesn't flow along the lines followed by every other romance writer. She always includes interesting detours that sets her apart from the rest. In GABRIEL'S ANGEL, she tosses in a wealthy ex-mother-in-law who is determined to take the baby out of Laura's care. Then the battle of the wealthy matriarchs ensues.<br /><br />Don't let the synopsis of this book trick you into believing that GABRIEL'S ANGEL will be a typical romance. It's nothing but atypical when written by Nora Roberts.	2005-05-05

This has typical romantic episodes of a guy who's been in love with one woman for years and has watched the woman of his dreams marry another and live in Hell for the years she's married. After she divorces and her husband is sent to prison, Devin decides that Cassie should learn how a man who loves her beyond reason should treat a woman.<br /><br />HEART OF DEVIN MACKADE shows how love is sometimes not enough especially when abuse and heartache exist in the recent past of the person. It takes a patient, understanding man willing to put his own desires on hold to finally win her love and trust.<br /><br />This conventional romance delves into a deeper issue. Nora Roberts shows that a sensitive, caring man can still be macho and won't be ridiculed by society. HEART OF DEVIN MACKADE has an average plot that Roberts turns into a fairy-tale romance!  When you turn that last page and finish reading, a sigh will escape and a \\"that's nice\\" will be uttered. Definitely not intense reading but perfect for some down time spent relaxing!	2005-05-05

FROM THIS DAY is the story of BJ Clark and has a weak premise to begin with and continues a downhill course. BJ is a manager of an old-fashioned country inn and stands up to the new owner, Taylor Richards. When she does, it's not one with respect and intelligent, but comes across like a spoiled child making demands and giving ultimatums. What I don't understand is why BJ thinks she can make demands on a new owner to the point of telling him what he will and will not change about the way the business is run. It's his business, not hers, and she can be replaced! I understand loving your job, but she definitely crosses the lines of propriety and doesn't have a real sense of her own job responsibilities.<br /><br />This would be enough to throw the story off kilter, but Nora Roberts has other ideas. She creates a male character that is so power hungry and self centered that he makes demands as only a chauvinist can!<br /><br />A woman with no spine who whines about proposed changes to the inn and an overbearing new owner that thinks his money is enough for him to control and order everyone - including during their non-working hours. This relationship reminds me of Archie and Edith Bunker, but it's not written to be funny like the sitcom was! It may have been more acceptable in the era in which it was written (late 70's early 80's) but I doubt it. It probably rankled even then!	2005-05-05

COURTING CATHERINE is the beginning of a series revolving around the Calhoun women. This story tells of a strong female (Catherine or CC) who would rather work in her auto repair business than worry about attracting men. She's happy with her life, herself and wouldn't change much. If only we all could have the amount of self-esteem that CC has!<br /><br />The exception to her happy life is the fact that she's being forced to sell her family home to a hotel conglomerate. And then there is always the fact that she and her family are unable to find the truth about a story of missing emeralds whose legend has spanned many generations. Is the story true and are the emeralds real, or is it a tall tale handed down from generation to generation?<br /><br />Trenton St. James III is the owner of the company buying the Calhoun mansion (with a name like that, you know he has to be wealthy).  He goes to the coast of Maine to arrange the final details. A spit and polished business man attracted to a pretty grease monkey -- sounds far-fetched but Nora Roberts pulls it off as only she can. COURTING CATHERINE will have you cheering for CC's spunk and understanding how Trent can fall hopelessly in love with her.<br /><br />This romance goes well, but the future of the emeralds must wait until another book in the series. COURTING CATHERINE doesn't have much in the way of cerebral exercises, but will definitely have you smiling and saying, \\"Ah...\\".	2005-05-05

It has us continuing with the same cast of characters but focusing on Ruth Bannion who was a child in DANCE TO THE PIPER.  Also includes is Nickolai Davidov - the former dance partner of Ruth's step-mother, Maddie O'Hurley, and now a big time choreographer. Ruth has always had two loves - dancing and Nickolai. She just needs to convince him that she's no longer a child.<br /><br />DANCE OF DREAMS deals with fears - fears of the professional dancer and the cut-throat competition of that profession, fear of rejection and the fear of losing true love. With a background of dance practices and performances, Nora Roberts tells a love story that is anything but typical.<br /><br />At times while reading this book, you'll want to grab one or both of the main characters and shake some common sense into them.  However, it's a good story that's well told and brings people into the lime light with whom the reader can relate, even non-dancers.	2005-05-05

It's a perfect escape hatch from the rat race of life.<br /><br />THE HEART'S VICTORY revolves around the world of auto racing and love long denied. Life changing decisions are necessary in the lives of the two main characters (Lance and Foxy) but will they be conducive with love?<br /><br />Foxy was raised around the race circuit and Lance has always been a part of her life. The major conflict is that Lance still sees Foxy as a child, even though she's grown into a woman who specializes on photographing sporting events all over the world. These two are thrown back together when Foxy takes an assignment photographing the world of racing, including her brother's racing team, which now includes Lance as the backer. Confused? I was too for a good portion of this story and it left me with a sense of not really knowing the characters or what was going on in the book. Sparks fly between the two of them which is inevitable and only then does the story get a bit interesting. We find out what happened years ago to make Foxy leave racing and go out on her own in a completely different profession.<br /><br />This is not typical Nora Roberts with stereotypical characters: a macho, good-looking former race car driver turned owner (Lance); a younger, attractive girl turned woman (Foxy) raised on the race circuit; and a small group of support characters fading in and out of the story without much of a glimpse as to why they are really involved.<br /><br />There isn't much in this book that's memorable but is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. But it does falls into the average range.	2005-05-05

In this tale, an eleven-year-old witnesses a suicide and hears a deathbed confession as he watches the mob lawyer die. Now this kid just has to tell the Louisiana police what he knows and then everything is wonderful - simple right? NO! This streetwise kid knows his life is over if he opens his mouth.<br /><br />John Grisham brings to life an adolescent who is wise beyond his years and makes those of us who aren't street smart open our eyes very wide and observe the real world (or at least the real world portrayed in this book).<br /><br />Grisham has created one of my favorite characters in THE CLIENT: Reggie Love. Reggie Love is a feisty attorney who's tough because she was not given a choice but to be resilient in order to survive her life. Reggie's love for children and life is made very clear throughout this book and the reader can't help smiling at her antics against the District Attorney and the police department when they don't think about the safety of her client!<br /><br />In my opinion, Reggie Love makes THE CLIENT a winner! I hope Grisham brings this character back in another story!!	2005-05-05

This is a story of Jack Mercy, a wealthy ranch owner with three daughters each from a different wife and strangers to each other.  MONTANA SKY begins when Jack dies, and his daughters are gathered for the funeral.  They are shocked to learn that they will each inherit huge sums of money as stated in his will. But Jack loves his Montana ranch and wants to convince his daughters of the benefits of ranch living.  Thus he has put a stipulation on this inheritance - they must each live together on his ranch for one year.<br /><br />That premise would be enough to make this a very enjoyable book, however, Roberts refuses to have an uncomplicated story line. She throws in a monster that is butchering cattle, even kills one of the ranch hands, and is threatening the people who work and live on the ranch. The three sisters must find out the identity of the villain while protecting each other. They become friends along the way, not only with each other, but also with some very interesting male counterparts.  (Does Nora Roberts ever have uninteresting male counterparts?)<br /><br />MONTANA SKY is divided into three parts, each focusing the main attention on one of the sisters.  I'm not sure how she accomplishes it, but she weaves this story and the three lead characters seamlessly through events of the year.  It's outstanding!<br /><br />Nora Roberts is a master at combining romance, mystery, thrills and chills. She throws them all in the pot and the outcome is a highly flavored tale. This is a book that I will enjoy re-reading several times over the years! I highly recommend MONTANA SKY -- it's a great mystery on top of everything else!!	2005-05-04

About half way through the book, I looked at the publication date (1988) and realized why it lacked the zing present in her recent books.<br /><br />WHITE LIES opens with Jay Granger being fired and later that night a visit from the FBI is paid to her.  What could she have done to warrant this visit?  Well, seems her ex-husband was in an explosion and they want her to identify him.  He's alive, but in a drug induced coma.  She goes to the hospital only to see a man resembling a mummy.  How could she identify him since the features she could see were either swollen or bruised, or had been put back together by plastic surgeons?  But FBI agent Frank Payne pushed for a positive identification and she said it was Steve Crossfield, her ex-husband.<br /><br />When Crossfield responds to her touching his arm, Payne persuades her to stay with him until he's completely recovered, which could be a few months.  With her there, Crossfield struggles to regain consciousness only to realize he has amnesia.  So it's a bit convoluted and far-fetched, but remember he was in a massive explosion and wasn't supposed to live.  Ok, so it's pure fiction, but it's enjoyable!<br /><br />WHITE LIES is not one of Howard's best pieces of fiction, but true to form (even in the early stages) it's fun to read and at times you will chuckle out loud.  There are way too many coincidences in the book to be of the mystery genre, so I guess it could be labeled strictly pleasurable romance.	2005-05-04

HOME PORT is a story about Dr. Miranda Jones, an expert in authenticating artwork. She is attacked in the driveway of her family's Maine home and the thug steals her bags, slashes her tires and leaves. Instead of dwelling on the attack, she sets off to Italy after being summoned by her mother to verify the authenticity of a bronze sculpture, The Dark Lady. Although this was to be a feather in her professional cap, the job just about destroys her when the sculpture turns out to be fake. Her mother blames her for the bad publicity for the family museum and she has no one who will believe in her. Enter an art thief, Ryan Boldari, who becomes her partner in more ways than one, and is the only one willing to help prove her innocence in this matter.<br /><br />It's my opinion that Nora Roberts just keeps getting better and better as seen with her latest accomplishments! Roberts has taken several plots used by many writers and combined the efforts into something new. The outcome is an astonishingly wonderful way to spend a few days! I highly recommend this book and have to admit that I was unable to determine the culprit until the last third of the book. Roberts has invented a mean mother that gives the wicked stepmother in Cinderella a run for the money! She knows no bounds when creating characters of every ilk known to man (and it often leaves me wondering where she finds these folks). Life in Roberts' world is definitely interesting!<br /><br />If you've never read any of Nora Roberts novels, pick up one of her latest.

In HER MOTHER'S KEEPER, a daughter (Gwen Lacrosse) comes to the rescue of her mother to save her from certain scandal.  The only problem is the mother doesn't know she's in danger of being disgraced. The villain (Luke Powers) is a younger man who has been staying in the Lacrosse mansion while he is finishing one of his books.<br /><br />Set in New Orleans, Nora Roberts definitely gets the Cajon flavor correct with this story. Hot and humid could describe both the environment and the feelings Gwen develops for Luke. How does a daughter stop thinking romantic thoughts about her mother's boyfriend? Luke is her mother's liaison, or is it wishful thinking that they really are only friends?<br /><br />Roberts bounces the reader back and forth on that perspective - is he or isn't he - only the mother knows for sure (and of course Luke, but he's not saying!). Ok, charming, but brainless, is a better description for this one, but I can't resist since it was so cute!<br /><br />HER MOTHER'S KEEPER is a story with an exotic flare, pure romance, but mostly filled with humor. Nora Roberts shows that you can laugh at yourself in almost any situation!	2005-05-04

HIDDEN RICHES is a tale about an antique dealer (Dora Conroy) who buys some items for her shop at an auction and becomes the target of an international criminal. Enter Jed Skimmerhorn (where did she get that name?) who is an ex-cop and new neighbor of Dora's. His attraction to her causes him to jump back into the crime game to protect Dora at all costs. They have to figure out why she is the target and they find out that treasures can be hidden almost anywhere. Of course they have to battle a mutual attraction along the way!<br /><br />Ok, this theme has been done over and over again, but not was well as Nora Roberts does it! Once again she adds romance and mystery together for her own special blend of wonderful reading. She does it so well, that I've forgotten if she writes a better romance novel or mystery. She always has strong characters and interesting locations. She doesn't buy into the one weak and one strong character issue, but instead combines passion, strong wills, intelligence, etc. This is a much more realistic view of people in today's world.<br /><br />I've read most of her books, and with the exception of a few Silhouette Romance novels in the beginning of her career, I haven't found any that I didn't like. I've especially enjoyed her latest (actually those from the last 5 or so years!) which combine the genres and create a fictional account that is her own extraordinary writing style and has something for every type of reader!	2005-05-04
US	51874804	R2FVNRLT2ZAKH8	0553264613	559326423	Hot Ice	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Not Hot, But Lukewarm!	HOT ICE is an interesting tale about a wealthy woman and a first rate thief. Nora Roberts likes to use this premise and has used it in several of her books. However, each has different entwined subplots that make them each unique. She does use a few of the same guidelines:<br /><br />1. The woman is beautiful and usually wealthy.<br /><br />2. The thief (usually male) is always gorgeous and street savvy.<br /><br />I personally am waiting for her to write about a really homely thief and a poor woman; now that would be an interesting concept, right? Ok, so maybe that's why I'm not a published author and Nora Roberts is one of the best!<br /><br />One of the variances in HOT ICE from her other books is that the race to find treasure begins in Manhattan and ends in Madagascar. The usual trials and tribulations occur: passion trying to be denied, a rival enemy hot on their tails, etc. HOT ICE is more along the lines of pure romance with a little mystery thrown in for balance. In my opinion, Roberts's better efforts have more mystery and less romance, as she's excellent at setting the stage for suspense.<br /><br />HOT ICE is a good story, but not fantastic. I wouldn't label it a \\"stop light book\\" as is my term for a book that is absolutely impossible to put down, so much so that you read a few lines while waiting at a red light in your car! I would much rather recommend MONTANA SKY, SANCTUARY, THE REEF or another more recent Roberts novel. However, if you've already read these and wish to fill some time, this would be the book for you!	2005-05-04

Jo Ellen had grown up off of the Georgia coast in a resort called Sanctuary (actually they call it a resort, but it's more of a Bed and Breakfast Victorian style house and there are campgrounds around the island - not a true resort, but it does sound wonderful). Jo Ellen's memories of Sanctuary were not happy ones after her mother disappeared when she was a child, 20 years previously.<br /><br />Jo Ellen starts receiving pictures of herself in the mail and realizes she's being stalked. Then she has a nervous breakdown when she's sent one of her beautiful mother, lying naked and dead. That shocks her and sends her back to her family and Sanctuary.<br /><br />Has that synopsis intrigued you enough to want to read this book? Ok, let me help captivate you some more with my story of reading this book:<br /><br />I took this hardback with me on vacation when it first came out. What a huge mistake! My vacation wasn't restful and relaxed until I finished this story! SANCTUARY refused to let me put it down and would call my name until I picked it up and began reading again. As I was sitting on the beach supervising my daughters build the world's best sandcastle; I could hear that book in my bag. As we were getting ready for bed in preparation for a full day of adventure the next day, SANCTUARY would call out to me. Ok, so maybe the book didn't speak, but the story sure did - I was so engrossed with the tale that I couldn't put it down. I'd stay up late at night reading \\"just one more chapter\\".<br /><br />I was at that resort with Jo Ellen while she was trying to mend the family relationships with her siblings, Lexy and Brian, and as she tried to break through the wall her father had erected around himself after his wife had disappeared. I felt like I was there when she met Nathan Delaney, whose family had stayed on the island the summer of her mother's disappearance. I had goose bumps when the eerie pictures arrived in the mail and the stalker followed Jo Ellen back to Sanctuary.<br /><br />SANCTUARY has to be one of Nora Roberts's best books. It grabs the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go. Roberts draws the reader so far into the story that you are breathing hard as Jo Ellen is racing through the trees to find the stalker. You don't' feel safe until you know what happened to Jo Ellen's mother (did she just abandon her family as was the speculation or something worse). You absolutely must know the identity of the person behind sending those awful pictures.<br /><br />I've always felt that Roberts is a master manipulator who draws the reader into the lives of her characters, but she has out done herself with this one. She has made it an interaction between the story line and the reader, one the reader won't soon forget!<br /><br />One word to describe SANCTUARY: EXCELLENT.eerie pictures arrived in the mail and the stalker followed Jo Ellen back to Sanctuary.  <br /> <br />SANCTUARY has to be one of Nora Roberts's best books.

Parks is a major league baseball player who is cast in a series of men's clothing commercials, which will be directed by Brook. Sparks fly between these two from the first moment their eyes meet. Their entire courtship (it's a romance, you knew there would be one!) is composed of battles between these two dynamic people. The story line will make you laugh and sigh -- it's filled with romance, humor and a few stressful situations that will get your blood pumping.<br /><br />Some of the sub-plots are predictable as seen with many of Nora Roberts's earlier books, but that doesn't lessen the overall impact RULES OF THE GAME has on the reader. The tale has a storybook / fairy tale theme with a few twists and turns along the way. Not only does Roberts give the reader a peek into the commercial business, but also that of major league sports. But more importantly, Nora Roberts shows that a career woman can have it all without giving anything up -- she can have a great job and a fantastic love life. And a strong willed man can have the love of his life in a person who keeps him on his toes and doesn't cow-tail to his every whim.<br /><br />This is definitely an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.	2005-05-03

RISING TIDES is the second book in the Chesapeake Bay trilogy and focuses on Ethan. Ethan is the quiet brother who loves the ocean. He's the one who started the family boat-building business and not only works there, but also runs his commercial fishing boat. He's the one who tries to direct the brothers into a successful future business, but isn't afraid of the hard work involved in getting them to achieve that success.<br /><br />Almost as a sub-plot is the fact that Ethan has been in love with Grace for as long as he can remember, but considers her off-limits because of a dark secret in his past. As he gently guides Seth (the newest adopted brother) into the future, he is led to accept his past by the ghost of his father and not to place blame on himself. It's an Interesting concept and very effective.<br /><br />These two sub-plots are entwined, so you don't really understand which is more important until you learn the secret that is keeping Ethan from fully realizing his dreams. Once that secret is revealed, the sub-plots are merged. This sounds confusing, but is well written and flows nicely together.<br /><br />This series just keeps getting better with each book! Nora Roberts shows wit, charm and romance in RISING TIDES. It's also a very different style for her (and her fans), as she's writing from a male perspective. As I was reading it, I realized I was seeing things through the eyes of Ethan, and not Grace. This writing style didn't draw me into \\"living\\" the story, but instead kept me as a very interested bystander.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth reading. In fact the entire Chesapeake Bay trilogy is an excellent choice for entertainment reading.	2005-05-03

The glimpse back at their childhood and teen years is accomplished with flashbacks, and is done with expertise so the story is smooth and not jerky as many flashbacks can sometimes appear.<br /><br />HOLDING THE DREAM focuses on Kate Powell who was raised by the Templetons from the time she was a small child when her family was killed. Even though she was a cousin to Laura Templeton, she was raised as her sister, never any difference being shown between the girls.<br /><br />Kate doesn't have the attractiveness of Margo or Laura's sophistication, but she has always been the top in her class academically and has excellent in all aspects of the business world. She has received promotion after promotion in a large accounting firm, but is set up by a shrewd co-worker and her world comes crashing down around her. With the help of her life long friends, Kate refocuses her efforts into the business the three of them have set up and realizes that something is missing from her life. Since this is a pure romance novel, you can guess that the \\"something missing\\" is love.<br /><br />That last line isn't meant to be cynical because Nora Roberts pulls off an excellent story with vibrant characters and the beautiful background of Big Sur, California. At times I felt like I could actually hear those waves crashing on the cliffs! As typical, her story is great, but I felt it was a little flat and not up to her usual standard of greatness. She only grazes a couple of minor details brought out in the book and left me wanting to explore those elements. For example, I wanted to learn about more on the Templetons. This couple not only raised their daughter and son but saw to it that their extended family's child and their maid's child were given many of the same opportunities as their own children. This must truly be an exceptional couple, but we aren't allowed to know that fact because we are only given glimpses of them.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book, not one of her best, but far superior to many writers currently on the market. A safe bet for a few enjoyable hours.uly be an exceptional couple, but we aren't allowed to know that fact because we are only given glimpses of them. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good book, not one of her best, but far superior to many writers currently on the market.

It had all of the elements that make James Patterson's Alex Cross books winners, but I found myself wondering just how much tragedy and bad luck one person could endure. After finishing the book and reflecting back, I now question if this reaction wasn't exactly what Patterson wanted the reader to think and feel. I'm now of the belief that Patterson is an expert at manipulating the emotions of the reader like a cloth blowing in the wind - at any time, he can change the direction of the wind, and the cloth, unable to resist, just continues along the way. Patterson is amazingly true and accurate in this manipulation ensuring that we as readers don't realize we're being maneuvered until we've turned that last page.<br /><br />All of the regular cast members have returned in POP GOES THE WEASEL: Alex Cross, John Sampson, Christine Johnson, Nana, Damon and Janelle. This book introduces another diabolical villain who enjoys masquerading as a taxi cab driver that not only murders his fares, but tortures them as well, then does bizarre things to the corpses. Where does Patterson come up with this evilness book after book? The antagonist is definitely wicked, psychotic, and a master mind!<br /><br />POP GOES THE WEASEL leaves the doors wide open for a sequel. This one is not as good as CAT AND MOUSE but still excellent. My only complaint is that James Patterson hooks us with these stories and then we have to wait almost a year for the next one to be published. He definitely needs to write much faster to keep his loyal fans happy and reading!!	2005-05-03

INNER HARBOR is the conclusion to the Chesapeake Bay trilogy and as is Nora Roberts's usual style, she finishes with a bang!<br /><br />The last brother to be featured in this trilogy is Phillip Quinn, the perfect one. He's an accountant with a large firm, has a condo overlooking the harbor, knows a good wine, and looks great in a custom tailored suit. Looking at Phillip, no one would realize that as a young boy he had grown up on the streets and had his life saved by Ray and Anna Quinn before they adopted him, which included Anna removing a bullet near his heart.<br /><br />Phillip is struggling with Seth, a boy his father had \\"rescued\\" and added to the family amid much controversy and speculation. On his father's deathbed, all three boys had promised that they'd look out for Seth and raise him. He seems to be fitting into the family, but the addition has caused a tremendous amount of shifting lifestyles and schedules.<br /><br />Just when everyone thought things were going smoothly, a lady arrives in town to do research for her new book, but is really checking out the Quinns. Phillip is attracted to her, she's attracted to him, and then he finds out her big secret. She's Seth's aunt and she could destroy everything that the boys have worked to put together. She could take Seth away from them, and take Phillip's heart with her.<br /><br />Sounds like a typical romance story, but with Nora Roberts behind the pen, it's definitely not. It's an enjoyable tale, but even more important are the emotions she brings to the forefront of the reader's mind. For instance, for someone who has never been to the Chesapeake Bay area, her descriptions of the landscape, sea, town and people left me wanting to go on vacation. I could see the water, smell the salt in the air, taste the ice cr&egrave;me that everyone gets. Another example, is the reaction to a mother who tosses a child around from person to person because she is too busy being selfish to care about him. Strong emotions, yes, but this kind of parent really does exist in the real world. It's just unfortunate that we don't have hundreds of people like the Quinns who take them in and love them. Ok, so I'm a romantic and want everyone happy and loved, is that a bad thing?<br /><br />This series is written from the male perspective and I found it interesting when guys were faced with domestic chores like cooking and cleaning. Their outlook was comical at times, and their ideals of importance were fascinating.<br /><br />Definitely a book that avid Nora Robert's fans will enjoy, and a tale that will entice those not familiar with this author to want to read more of her work!ns, yes, but this kind of parent really does exist in the real world.

The subject matter of THE PELICAN BRIEF was several years ahead of its time (seems to be the norm for John Grisham). Within the past few years, conspiracy theories have taken control of the spotlight in movies and books and I feel THE PELICAN BRIEF was a front runner to these other ideas.<br /><br />Tulane law student, Darby Shaw, has an idea that she didn't realize could mean her death. She came up with a theory that explained the assassinations of two Supreme Court justices, which occurred in one day. Darby writes a brief about this theory whose conspirator is an enemy of pelicans and other animals. Her boyfriend, and law professor, Thomas, gets killed by a car bomb meant for Darby, and she's on the run. While on the run, she meets Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham, who is determined to get to the bottom of the assassinations and is willing to help her escape.<br /><br />As is Grisham's habit, he develops the characters so well that the reader can relate to every aspect of them. As Darby is running and hiding in New Orleans, I felt as if I was there, scared, smelling the scents that only New Orleans has, wondering if I'm being watched, panicked, etc.<br /><br />If I had to choose one of Grisham's strongest qualities of his writing it would have to be his character development. His characters emit emotions to the depth where the reader has empathy and actually lives that part in the story.<br /><br />THE PELICAN BRIEF is another excellent story and I highly recommend that if you haven't already read this book, you should definitely pick up a copy. It's enticing and action paced. The time will fly by when you're involved with this one!	2005-05-02

The story is about a tobacco company being sued and this lawsuit will set precedent for those in the future. Sound boring? It might be if that was the entire premise of the book. Instead Grisham throws in a jury of people with secrets they want to keep hidden, lawyers who have researched and manipulated these jurors to reach a verdict on their behalf, and a young man who takes control of this jury once behind closed doors in the jury room. The young man turns out to be a master manipulator, but is he the ultimate manipulator, or is someone else pulling the strings?<br /><br />When millions of dollars are at stake, lawyers, corporate executives, and others, will stop at nothing to win this case. Juror #2 also will stop at nothing to make the colossal tobacco company pay dearly no matter what it takes. So who is stronger and who will succeed as victor?<br /><br />THE RUNAWAY JURY deviates a little from Grisham's normal style of edge-of-your-seat action and instead delves into the mind games that are played in every courtroom in America. THE RUNAWAY JURY is a more cerebral mystery, but is still highly enjoyable.<br /><br />If you're looking for chases and exploding bombs, this is not the book for you. However, if you're looking for a good mystery that keeps you on your toes and guessing until the last page, then get a copy soon!	2005-05-02

AND THEN YOU DIE was the first Iris Johansen mystery/suspense book that I read and to say that I enjoyed it would be an understatement. This is definitely a \\"stop light book\\" (for my definition of a \\"stop light book\\" please see my review on THE UGLY DUCKLING by Iris Johansen). I couldn't put this book down. As a side note, I have to tell you that the reason for this title will become clear about half way through the book and then you'll stop thinking of it as a strange name!<br /><br />AND THEN YOU DIE is about group of people threatening to destroy the world with chemical warfare and photojournalist Bess Grady stumbles into the testing grounds with her sister. Grady is a photojournalist and is assigned to photograph a small village in Mexico.  When they arrive at the village, they find that all of the people are dead, except for a baby. Bess leaves her sister as she goes for help and is knocked unconscious by soldiers arriving in decontamination suits. She awakens to find herself in a hospital bed and her sister has disappeared. Now she must trust someone whom she believes is one of the murderers in order to save her life and that of the baby she has rescued.<br /><br />Sounds like a typical synopsis from most suspense books, right? With Iris Johansen writing it, you can bet on anything but typical. I enjoy mysteries of all kinds and being the avid bibliophile that I am, I can usually figure out the bad guy in an excellent mystery around the middle point in the book. I may be able to figure out the villain in Johansen's books, but I can't grasp the entire scheme of things. Another thing that I enjoy about her books is that there are no clear cut bad guys/good guys, after all aren't we all a mixture? If I had to use one word to describe both her characters and her books it would be \\"complex\\".<br /><br />This is another author who has crossed genres from romance to mystery/suspense and has done so with a flare that few can match. Describing her work as excellent is not an embellishment and doesn't do this book justice. I've given my copy of this book to a few friends who have become avid Johansen fans after reading it. They did lose sleep in order to finish the story, but didn't seem to hold it against me for suggesting the book in the first place (and then they asked if I had any other books by her!).t is not an embellishment and doesn't do this book justice.

The storyline is fast paced and full of edge-of-your-seat action.<br /><br />This tale follows the life of Mitch McDeere a lawyer right out of Harvard who goes to work for a large firm in Memphis, Tennessee. The prestigious firm turns out to have numerous skeletons in the closet, which leads Mitch to learn that many of his colleagues are dying in strange circumstances. Then along comes the FBI poking around asking a lot of questions about Mafia connections, among other things.<br /><br />The characters are powerful and well developed; the storyline is filled with lots of detail and the sub-plots are interesting and lead to the overall excellence of this book.<br /><br />Another positive was when I heard that this book was going to be made into a movie. I rushed right out to see it and was very disappointed. The movie would have been excellent if it had not deviated so drastically from the book. The deviation made the movie seem far-fetched and, in my opinion, was not an accolade for Grisham. I also feel this movie may deter some from reading the more realistic book.<br /><br />THE FIRM is very well written (as is Grisham's norm) and gives the reader an insight into the various pitfalls a lawyer can face. The book is much better than the movie, and I suggest that it be added to your list of books to read!	2005-05-02

I had heard many speculate on Margaret Mitchell planning on a sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND, but I never really thought about it. After all, how could an author write a sequel if she was dead?<br /><br />Before the release of SCARLETT there was much conjecture on whether or not Margaret Mitchell's descendents would be pleased with this book. Some say they interviewed writers before giving permission for this book, others say Alexandra Ripley was handpicked. I'm not sure if this was true or merely the pre-publication hype.<br /><br />SCARLETT picks up where GONE WITH THE WIND left off, but still has the same cast of characters from the original book. I must admit that Ripley did her research and has a smooth transition from one story line to the other. What she doesn't have is the insight into the characters that Margaret Mitchell created and breathed life into.<br /><br />You do have the romance between Scarlett and Rhett but Ripley tries to tone down Scarlett's personality and make her into an unselfish Southern Belle. Yeah right, Scarlett didn't have an unselfish bone in her body!  An example of this would be the scene where Scarlett and Rhett are sailing and the boat capsizes. Ok, nice try, but can you really see Scarlett on a boat with ocean spray hitting her in the face and the breeze mussing her hair? No way!  Can you see her swimming in the ocean at all?  I'm not even sure I can see her at the beach looking at the ocean!<br /><br />SCARLETT is enjoyable and a decent piece of fiction but if you're looking for a story that equals GONE WITH THE WIND, this is lacking in that effort. I read this book when it first came out. In fact, I had a copy reserved so I could pick it up on the first day of its release. After reading it, I realized that I could have easily waited until it came out in paperback!	2005-05-02

I don't remember who recommended this author to me, but I'm very grateful for that advice, even though it cost me a few nights of sleep!<br /><br />GUARDIAN is the story of Mary Anne Carpenter who moves to Idaho with her two children to become the guardian of her teenage godson who has recently become orphaned (hence the book title). The people in the small town where they now reside don't seem to like her godson, while Mary Anne is trying to understand why they have an aversion to him, she learns about a series of brutal murders in the nearby area. Could they all be connected?<br /><br />Picturesque Idaho is the backdrop and a teenager that has just lost his parents is one of the main characters, what's so scary about that? You'd think moving to a ranch in Idaho is a dream come true, even if the circumstances are not perfect in the beginning, but this is far from the ideal situation.<br /><br />Believe me, this is one of the most frightening books I've ever read. It wasn't scary so much for the content and the exact story line, but my imagination went into over-drive because of this book. \\"What if\\" became the beginning to many of my ideas and I didn't sleep well for several nights because the premise of this \\"villain\\" was so diabolical and present in all of our lives. Could this work of fiction actually come true, not exactly as written, but in an offshoot? You bet it could and that fact is what scared me the most.<br /><br />I've recommended this book to several friends, all of whom have loved it. Those who never read anything written by John Saul also became avid fans. If you don't mind losing a few nights sleep (first by wanting to finish the book, then because of nightmares) and if you want to be intrigued from the first page until the last, then this is the book for you.	2005-05-02

When I first saw the title of this book, I thought it was a facetious remark by the author. Many people believe that there is never a time to kill, but after reading this book, it may have changed some of those minds.<br /><br />John Grisham loves to get the reader emotionally involved with his stories and A TIME TO KILL was no exception. This is actually his first novel and he has said it was his favorite of his first six books. I can't say that I agree with him that A TIME TO KILL is my favorite, but it is very good and I did enjoy reading it (at least most of the time).  Some scenes were too graphic and too much for me to enjoy.<br /><br />This story is of Jake, a young lawyer (are there any other kinds of lawyers in his novels?), who defends a black Vietnam veteran on trial for murder. Sounds like a familiar plot, right? Wrong! This man kills two white men (and I use the term \\"men\\" very loosely) who raped his young daughter and left her for dead. The telling of the brutal crime against this innocent child had my hair standing on end. It was vivid and had my stomach flipping as I was wondering if such diabolical people do exist in our world today, and they certainly could not exist in the US. But once again I was wrong, they do exist and they exist everywhere that we allow racism to creep into our society.<br /><br />The town is split between those wanting to give the father a medal for killing the scum, the card-carrying KKK members who want to see him hanged, and a variety of others that go the distance of the entire spectrum of characters and emotions.<br /><br />Many will say that this story is too close to the truth, and I admit that parts of it are extremely difficult to read. However it may be necessary in order to open minds that this type of hatred really does exist.<br /><br />This book definitely opens your eyes wide to racism, lack of values, crimes against women and children, etc. You have to be tough emotionally to read this book (I actually cried through part of it) but it is very interesting and makes you wonder if there really is a time to kill.ly cried through part of it) but it is very interesting and makes you wonder if there really is a time to kill. <br />	2005-05-02
US	51874804	R1PFN9RFJYM7JU	0440224764	999720718	The Partner	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Just An OK Book	THE PARTNER was a little bit different than most John Grisham's novels. Instead of plunging the reader into a crime in which a lawyer steals millions of dollars from the firm in which he's a partner, he begins the story at the capture of the lawyer on the run.<br /><br />This is a tale of Patrick Lanigan who four years previous to the opening chapter in the book stole 90 million dollars and hid it. Not only does the firm that he stole the money from want answers so do the client that was represented by the organization.<br /><br />If you think the action is over since Lanigan has already been caught, you're mistaken (somewhat). Through the use of flashbacks, Grisham gives the reader a sense of the history and involves them in the chase, limited as it may be. He stops short of telling the reader why a person with such a bright future would throw it all away, including a wife and baby, for money (ok, so it was tons of money, but was it really worth it?).<br /><br />THE PARTNER is typical Grisham with lots of twists and turns, but this story is possibly overdone with the changes. Just when you think you've figured everything out, he'll change course and have you second-guessing your answers. Grisham is a master at convincing the reader and then confusing them to the point of them changing their minds, and then he'll do it all over again. By the end of the book, you won't know any answers and be thrilled with the outcome.<br /><br />THE PARTNER has vivid backgrounds, candid characters and some limited excitement. I didn't enjoy it as much as I have his others, but it's still better than a lot of books that have been published. In THE PARTNER, it seems as if John Grisham doesn't have a clear-cut idea of where he wants to lead the reader.	2005-05-02

In FROM POTTERS FIELD, Temple Gault is back and he's at his worst (which is great news for the reader!). This psychopath is Kay Scarpetta's nemesis and New York is his home turf, which puts her at a definite disadvantage. Gault leaves special clues knowing Scarpetta will know it's his calling card and lure her closer to his trap for her. She knows she's in his web and he's drawing her ever closer but she is not able to stay away, for doing so would keep him free to increase his fatality rate.<br /><br />This has to be my favorite Patricia Cornwell book. I loved the game of cat and mouse that Gault plays with Scarpetta. I loved the way Scarpetta plays the game determined to win no matter what Gault tries to throw at her. And I especially loved the gift of the scalpel and the chase through the subway tunnels all over New York City (I can't say anymore without giving away too much!).<br /><br />This book is constant action with no slowing down so the reader can catch his/her breath. It's almost as if the same cat and mouse game being played between Scarpetta and Gault is being copied between Cornwell and the reader. I found myself \\"reading just one more chapter\\" so I could figure it all out and Cornwell keeping those answers just a few pages out of my reach. Oh sure, she'd dangle a carrot to tease me, a little morsel to keep me going, but kept me chasing the answers until the end!<br /><br />If you want a book that will help you relax before you go to bed or a book that will leave you with a feeling that all is wonderful in the world, pick up a book of poetry because this is definitely not the book for you. If you don't mind losing some sleep and want to be catapulted on a journey that is unforgettable, then pick up a copy of FROM POTTERS FIELD today! This story is the definition of a \\"thriller\\". Definitely a \\"stop light book\\" in my opinion. (If you would like know what I mean by a stop light book, please see my review on Ugly Duckling by Iris Johansen.)	2005-04-29

In this tale Scarpetta is on the trail of a killer who seems to only target couples, and one of his victims comes from a VIP family, so the government is anxious to have this murderer caught.<br /><br />This psycho leaves a jack of hearts at each crime scene and removes the shoes and socks of the victims. Very strange fetish!  Will these clues be enough for Scarpetta and Pete Marino to find the killer? They've succeeded with fewer clues before! This time they have a reporter dogging them who is intent on writing a book about these murders.<br /><br />Patricia Cornwell wrote this book after BODY OF EVIDENCE and continued with that standard of excellence with this story. This doesn't have the power punch ending that some of her other books have had, but it is a decent story. Her characters are vibrant and she encompasses a wide range of different personalities that keeps the reader interested and entertained.<br /><br />This isn't her best work, but is definitely worth reading. She has a few twists to her stories in that she brings in sidelines that are out of the ordinary. For example, the side-glance at the scene with the dogs trying to track the missing person/victim was unique and not something most writers would include - that's what makes Cornwell different than most writers. She's unique!	2005-04-29

In BODY OF EVIDENCE, a writer is killed after months of feeling like she is being constantly watched and receiving numerous annoying phone calls. Soon, Kay Scarpetta, everyone's favorite chief medical examiner, is on the trail of this killer by finding forensic evidence needed to put the jigsaw puzzle of this crime together. Little does she know that the killer is close, maybe too close, and knows she's getting closer.<br /><br />BODY OF EVIDENCE is one of the reasons Patricia Cornwell is a favorite among mystery bibliophiles all over the world. It's filled with constant action, non-stop thrills and chills, and seems like an endless roller-coaster ride from page one (did I leave out any clich&eacute;s to describe this story???). Cornwell delves into her main characters' psyches and we see what makes Scarpetta and Moreno tick (a glimpse into their real beings). Between the great development of her main characters and the storyline that will keep you constantly guessing, Cornwell once again created a masterpiece.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of her other books, this is a good one that will definitely hook you with her writing style!	2005-04-29

It was somewhat enjoyable, but for me, it left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />This is the story of Maggie Bradford, a famous singer/songwriter. American loves her, her children love her, but all of that is changed when her retired soccer-star husband is murdered and she's the prime suspect. When the fact emerges that she killed her first husband years before, the public suddenly question the self-defense story she is telling.<br /><br />This book revolves around the murder trial and uses flash back type scenes to bring the reader along as the lawyers look back at the life of Maggie Bradford.<br /><br />Many professional reviewers have used the word \\"suspenseful\\" to describe HIDE AND SEEK but I have to disagree. This story does make you think but I didn't find it suspenseful. Ok, maybe in a couple of places (like when Maggie was hiding under the porch and feared for her life) but it did not filtrate throughout the entire book. I found this story line very predictable and was not fooled or even second-guessed my forecasts of \\"who dun it\\". In fact, I figured everything out in the first quarter of the book when Patterson was still laying the groundwork. Not only does Patterson dump all of the answers directly in your lap, he does nothing to cover those answers or muddy the waters.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand this review, the book is well written and James Patterson sets the scenes well. I just found it lacking compared to his other work. HIDE AND SEEK is still better than a lot that is on the market, but I'd pick it up after exhausting everything on your \\"must read\\" list.	2005-04-29
US	51874804	R92Y4E957AT8V	0446601241	366731957	Kiss the Girls (Alex Cross)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Cassanova - A Real Sicko!	KISS THE GIRLS involves America's favorite detective, Alex Cross, who becomes involved in a series of murders and kidnappings in the Raleigh, North Carolina area when his niece, Naomi, is kidnapped from Duke University. His digging eventually leads him to Kate McTiernan, a medical student who has escaped the house of torture where this sicko takes his victims. After her escape, we find out that there are really two nutcases involved (one on the West Coast and one on the East Coast) who meet to compare notes and victims.<br /><br />The story is very good and keeps you on your toes to keep up with the action. There are a few gaps that Patterson jumps instead of bridging. For example, the fact that two psychos would play this kind of game of one-upmanship is never thoroughly explained and is brushed off by stating that they've been friends for years and met in school. James Patterson also alludes to romantic feelings between Alex Cross and Kate McTiernan but never fully explores the potential relationship and all that would entail (nor does he bring Kate McTiernan back in any of his subsequent novels to date, which does not keep in the character of Alex Cross).<br /><br />I do have to applaud Patterson on making his Cassanova villain worse than most introduced by any writer. I've wondered just where he came up with some of the tortures described in this book (the snake and milk scene is one of the worse and is haunting). A writer will be hard pressed to top this villain.<br /><br />KISS THE GIRLS is very good and I feel James Patterson gets better as he goes on down the list of his nursery rhyme named books. I'd recommend this book be added to your list of reading material even though he leaves a few loose ends. It's still one that will leave an impression with the reader long after they've finished that last page.	2005-04-29

In N IS FOR NOOSE, Kinsey Millhone takes on one of Robert Dietz' cases after he has knee surgery. (Remember her bodyguard turned lover from G IS FOR GUMSHOE?? Well, heeee's baaaack... or at least we get a glimpse of him anyway). Ok, back to the book ... Kinsey drives Dietz' Porsche back to Carson City for him and is a little shocked at his lifestyle - he actually lives in a penthouse! This part of the story falls short - I wasn't sure if this romance would continue sometime in the future, or if the spark had been doused. I guess Grafton wants to keep all the possibilities open and kept any details locked away from her readers!<br /><br />From Carson City, Kinsey goes to Nota Lake and her new case, that of a Selma Newquist. Selma's husband (a police detective) dies suddenly from a heart attack, but Selma suspects something else had killed her husband and Kinsey is the one to help solve the puzzle. Selma is a fresh character -- she's not too bright, applies her make up with a trowel, and just has one of those unique personalities that intrigue you and drive you nuts at the same time!<br /><br />I found this book to be very predictable (to the point of being almost boring) and found the most enjoyable parts to be those in which Selma was involved. The overall mystery was not there, and the normal spellbinding material that was typical for Grafton is missing.<br /><br />As Sue Grafton continues on her alphabetic journey, I sense she's running out of enthusiasm. Maybe she should jump out of this alphabet nightmare and write something different before she continues.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? Yeah, but with reservations - it's not the worst book on the market, but it's definitely not the best either!	2005-04-29

I'm not sure if it was the disappointment of Alex Cross not being in this tale, or the bouncing around, both physical and emotionally.<br /><br />The story revolves around Dr. David Strauss and opens with his wife being murdered at a party, in which he barely escapes. At almost the same time, his brother is killed at the Academy Awards and he then finds out that his old girlfriend is on the run for her life. So begins Strauss' search into why this is happening to his family and close friends. A search that drags the reader along as he streaks across Europe, to the Nazi concentration camps and finally ends up in Moscow in time for the Olympics.<br /><br />The tale leaps from place to place, and emotion to emotion with no clear cut methodology and leaves the reader with jet lag. Throughout SEE HOW THEY RUN, I found myself wondering why Patterson had included everything that he did and where his logic for that inclusion had come from. It was never clearly explained and many loose ends were left dangling. Instead of fooling the reader by covering up the guilty parties and their reasons for the assassinations with excellent dialog and mysterious situations, he keeps pulling new things in to confuse you.<br /><br />To me it seemed as if he didn't have a clear outline in the beginning of the book and kept adding things that \\"sounded good\\" to get the number of pages needed to publish it. Don't read this book and judge it to be a typical James Patterson novel - which would make you not want to read any of his other books, which are definitely worth reading. I'd like to chalk this up to a decent try, but definitely not a contender for a great book!	2005-04-29

Ok, so my brain has ceased to function in a recreational reading mode and is only turned on and processing information when I'm in class or at work (at least I hope it's processing the necessary information then!). Actually, Black Notice is a death notice, so it goes along with Cornwell's normal themes, but I could have been on to something...<br /><br />BLACK NOTICE continues the saga of Kay Scarpetta, the forensic pathologist and chief medical examiner from Richmond, Virginia, along with her normal sidekicks seen in previous books. Scarpetta is called into action when a cargo ship finds an eroding body in a cargo container. When Scarpetta investigates, she finds mysterious hairs on the victim, but no other trace evidence. (This is where I still thought the book was about Bubonic Plague, because Pete Marino actually gets body fluid on him, and I figured we was contaminated and could be a goner! Ok, so my mind speeds ahead and tries to figure out not only the ending, but the subplots as well, and in this case, I was way off base.) A few days later, a murdered convenience store clerk has the same strange hairs covering her body and Kay Scarpetta realizes she's once again on the hunt for a serial killer.<br /><br />I found BLACK NOTICE to be lacking Patricia Cornwell's normal dynamic writing style. She seemed to throw in new characters and subplots without them leading anywhere (page fillers, perhaps?). An example of the new characters would be Diane Bray, the new police deputy chief who hates Marino with a passion. Cornwell could have delved into this character more than she did and had a great subplot, but instead only hit the highlights and left the reader wanting more.<br /><br />Lucy also returns, but is not the same Lucy from the past. She's explosive, unsure of herself, and suicidal. Wow, who is this person and what has she done with the Lucy we all know and love? The Lucy who's kick-ass tough and doesn't back down from anyone? The walking genius with guts?<br /><br />Then there's Pete Marino. Since when does Marino take guff from anyone? He allows Diane Bray to demote him to a patrol officer with little comment. Ok, I can see Marino possibly going along with this since he's fairly close to retirement, but for him not to make snide remarks whenever he's around the higher-ups is something I just can't fathom! He does make a few off-base remarks, but nothing like we've come to expect and enjoy from his explosive personality.<br /><br />Patricia Cornwell has come up with a semi-unique killer, but I found the ending to be far-fetched. She can just wait around for this intelligent killer who has eluded police on two continents to just walk directly into her little trap? Give me a break! Cornwell blew it on this ending - it could have been so much more dramatic!<br /><br />I would still recommend reading this book - it's a very good read for those who aren't familiar with Patricia Cornwell's past work.

After reading AND THEN YOU DIE, I immediately picked up this book and began reading.<br /><br />THE UGLY DUCKLING was captivating from the beginning and nothing like the fairy tale for which it is named. The story of Nell Calder, an average looking woman who was told how ugly she was all of her life and came to believe it, is thrown into the middle of murder and mayhem. What she didn't realize was that she was at the center of that nastiness. She miraculously survives an assassination attempt, while everyone else at a party is murdered, including her daughter. She comes through, but is so badly injured she requires a completely new face, compliments of the world's top plastic surgeon. All of the recovery is arranged by Nicholas Tanek her self-imposed guardian angel, or is he?<br /><br />This book is a great thriller with a little romance thrown in for balance. Johansen has once again written a winner and does it with her unique style. Her novels are more exciting, and have more twists and turns, than a roller coaster ride. Just when you think you've figured it all out, she throws a monkey wrench into the works, and you're back to square one.<br /><br />I have a term for a book that is impossible to put down: \\"a stoplight book\\". That's what I call a book that you have lying on the front seat of your car, and you read a few sentences or a paragraph while waiting for the stoplight to turn green. Now some of you may think that's pathetic, but you know it's a great story when the book calls your name while you're at a red light on your way to work or running errands! THE UGLY DUCKLING is definitely \\"a stoplight book\\".<br /><br />One of the things I admire about Johansen's writing style, is the fact that you never really know who the bad guy is until the end. You may have an idea but her characters are never clearly evil or good, but a mixture of both. Maybe that's why her books seem to mimic real life (it could be real life) and draw you in from the first page.<br /><br />This book should definitely be placed at the top of your reading list.

A friend suggested that I try one of Tony Hillerman's books and COYOTE WAITS is the one that I picked up. After finishing it, I was really glad that I had listened!<br /><br />This is the story of murder and mystery on a Navajo reservation located in Arizona and New Mexico (it crosses the border into both states). A Tribal Police Officer is murdered and an old shaman (medicine man) is charged with the murder. Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn (both Tribal officers) go their own ways to try and solve this case and end up crossing paths several times. Hillerman then throws in the family of the shaman who is trying to get someone to believe in his innocence. Next in the story is a young, female public defender that has just returned from Washington back to the place where she grew up and her first assignment is this case. A missing history professor in search of Butch Cassidy and a few other asundery characters are added to the mix for good measure. They all total a wide variety of personalities and ideas, which is part of the intrigue of COYOTE WAITS.<br /><br />This story was very interesting and at times suspenseful. It's more of a mystery type story than a tale filled with suspense, but it is very well done. The characters are vivid and seem to be mimicked from real-life people. The reservation, customs, and Indian myths are accurate and well described. These are interwoven into a book that wets your appetite for more and Tony Hillerman has a long list from which to choose.<br /><br />This book was the beginning of my journey with Hillerman, and if the others are as enjoyable, I will be very pleased.	2005-04-29

CRUEL AND UNUSUAL is another Kay Scarpetta story line that makes one really think about the death penalty and if innocent people are ever executed.<br /><br />In CRUEL AND UNUSUAL, Scarpetta investigates the homicide of a young boy, Eddie Heath, in which evidence resembles that of a case from the past - a case in which the convicted murderer, Ronnie Joe Waddell, is put to death that night. Very strange occurrences continue to happen, including the fingerprint of Waddell showing up in the next murder victim's home and a morgue supervisor being killed by the same gun that killed Eddie Heath. The confusion that envelops Kay Scarpetta adds to the drama of this book, as she wonders if the wrong man was executed. Could it be a simple case of mistaken identity? You can bet that nothing is simple when Patricia Cornwell is creating the story line and developing it!<br /><br />Just when the reader thinks he/she has figured everything out, Patricia Cornwell adds another dip in the road and makes you rethink the entire list of events. Cornwell keeps you guessing until the end, and does so with a flare that is unique and thrilling. It's interesting to see just how many questions about a crime that Scarpetta can answer (and you can keep up with) without overloading the reader's brain. Cornwell seems to have that fine line gauged properly, as she never over-burdens the reader but instead keeps them entertained and intrigued until the last page. This is one tale that will keep you thinking even past that last page and wonder, what if...	2005-04-29

I've tried to analyze the reason for this and the only thing I can come up with is that I found this story depressing. My relationships with my grandfathers were much different than that portrayed in this book, which left me with the feeling of not completely understanding (ok, I know that's shallow on my part, but combined with the depressing factor, it's relevant). I also can't understand the depth of the hatred this book shows of its main character.<br /><br />The story is about Adam Hall, an attorney right out of college, who finds out that his grandfather, Sam Cayhill, is on death row for killing two people. As he probes into the case further, he unearths the facts that Sam Cayhill is an active member of the Klu-Klux-Klan and has a hatred for all non-white people, besides being a person few would actually like. Adam decides to try to appeal his grandfather's case and stop his execution.<br /><br />As Adam dug further into his grandfather's life, the reader was shown the hatred racists have for their fellow man. It seemed when you would finally get used to this individual being a racist, another skeleton was found in his closet, and another demoralizing aspect of this character would come to the surface.<br /><br />While into this story, I found myself wondering if people really existed that were as closed-minded as Sam Cayhill. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is YES. Then as I followed the struggle of Adam trying to help his grandfather in court, I wondered why this young man would keep putting himself through the emotional turmoil, especially with a grandfather that has no intentions of having any kind of relationship with his grandson. Cayhill acted as if it was an inconvenience for him to even speak with Adam.<br /><br />The difference between this Grisham novel and his others is the speed of action. There is very little action and it moves a little faster than a snail. I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't read this book, but you do need to realize that it is not a typical action filled, keep you on the edge of your seat, type John Grisham novel.an to imply that you shouldn't read this book, but you do need to realize that it is not a typical action filled, keep you on the edge of your seat, type John Grisham novel. <br />	2005-04-28

All of the \\"professional\\" critics rave about this book and I have to agree with them, but only to a point. I still enjoyed a few of Patricia Cornwell's others more, yet POSTMORTEM  is a contender as a runner-up.<br /><br />The story revolves around a serial killer (yes-another one!) that enjoys strangling his victims. The worst part is that he leaves few if any clues which poses a huge problem for Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, Virginia. Enter into the picture the latest technology in forensic medicine and she's off to find her killer. She has the usual support cast of her niece Lucy, FBI profiler Wes Benton, and police detective Pete Marino.<br /><br />I often wonder if Patricia Cornwell's books would be as good if the support cast wasn't so vivacious. Let's face it, Kay Scarpetta can be a tad bit boring when left on her own and it takes the interaction between Marino or Lucy to make her come alive. The good doctor is a bit obsessive-compulsive about everything being in it's place and it takes a slob like Marino or a confused niece who is acting out against everyone to bring Kay Scarpetta out of her perfect world. And lucky for us, the readers, these battles are so enjoyable! No wonder Cornwell has collected all of the awards she's earned in the past decade.<br /><br />POSTMORTEM is another book to add to your reading list. It's enjoyable, thrilling and will keep you guessing who in her own department is trying to ruin Kay Scarpetta.	2005-04-28

So far, this is my favorite in the alphabet series by Sue Grafton, as it's full of excitement, suspense and a little romance thrown in just for balance. These made for a great combination and were expertly interlaced. By the end of the book, all of the loose ends involving the many subplots were tied neatly in a bow ... well almost all, Grafton had to leave a few at large to bring back in her future books!<br /><br />Sue Grafton has created Kinsey Milhone, a thirty-ish private investigator who's street smart and just normal enough that the reader can relate to her. She does quirky things like cutting her hair with nail scissors (she doesn't have the time or inclination to go to a beauty shop), hardly bothers with make-up (she doesn't waste the time) and is almost always in jeans and tennis shoes. Seems unlikely that a \\"hit\\" would be put on Kinsey's head, but that's what happens. She hires a bodyguard after she's run off the road in her little Volkswagen Bug (even though she's not thrilled with the idea of someone invading her space). Into her life enters Robert Dietz.<br /><br />Right from the beginning sparks fly between these two, hence the romantic aspect of the book. If I re-iterated the many subplots, I may inadvertently give details away that should remain hidden until you read this book. I will say that there are numerous subplots that weave in and out of the main story with smoothness that few authors can master. The reader is given a bigger glimpse of Henry (Kinsey's landlord), and we see a side of Kinsey that we haven't seen before. We actually find out that she is capable of loving and being loved, only to a point though, after all, her independence must never waiver! We also find out that she's not invincible and not the Wonder Woman type we were led to believe in Grafton's earlier books.<br /><br />This is the book where I really started to admire the character of Kinsey Malone. Grafton honed the details of this private eye until they were razor sharp and you either loved her or didn't, but I can guarantee that emotions were evoked one way or the other.<br /><br />The last few pages were read as if they were on fire and it left me anxious for the next book in the series, H IS FOR HOMICIDE. I've read all of the books in this alphabetical sequence and this one is by far my favorite so far! I only wish Sue Grafton would get back to this type of plot, details and layouts in her recent tales - there is no comparison between G IS FOR GUMSHOE and her latest attempts.sharp and you either loved her or didn't, but I can guarantee that emotions were evoked one way or the other. <br /> <br />The last few pages were read as if they were on fire and it left me anxious for the next book in the series, H IS FOR HOMICIDE.

If it was not for her telling me how much she enjoyed his books (and she and I usually have similar tastes in fiction), I never would have picked up another one of his books.<br /><br />LIGHTNING is far fetched and wasn't much on suspense until the end of the book - the first three-quarters of the story dragged. The basic concept was that every time lightning would strike, Laura would be saved from some sort of tragedy. This blond self-imposed guardian angel would appear just in the nick of time and save her once again. Ok, that was nice, but there wasn't much to it - no suspense - Koontz's timing was off on this one, as he didn't build the suspense before Laura was saved. And the catastrophes that Laura was saved from were random acts of weirdness - never any real direction to why these kept happening to the main character.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Koontz explains why this guardian angel type person keeps coming to save her and how this happens. After this, the reader begins to understand what this book is all about. Until then, we're kept guessing and wondering (and it's not the intriguing type of wonder!).<br /><br />If Koontz would rewrite this, it could be made into a much better story, after all the basics of a great tale are there. He needs to put a little pizzazz in the beginning and middle and then the reader would be hooked.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Yeah, it was an ok read, but definitely wouldn't be on the top of my scheduled reading list, more towards the bottom when the other books you're dying to read are not available and you need to fill some time.	2005-04-28

Her unique writing style is more like someone telling his/her favorite story and you only have to sit back and enjoy the tale.<br /><br />In this book Kinsey Millhone is hired to investigate the death of a claims adjuster and uncovers an insurance scam in the process. The trail leads into Los Angeles on her pursuit of a violent individual who may be the murderer. Kinsey is not afraid of following the suspect through the seedier side of LA and even into a bar adequately named \\"The Meat Locker\\" (gee, can you guess what kind of bar this is?). This is the fearless Kinsey Malone that we see in this saga.<br /><br />Yes, this is the insurance world's underground and Sue Grafton leads us through it with humor and a very biased opinion. Who else could come up with a singles bar named \\"The Meat Locker\\" and get away with the reader chuckling about it? Her books show her very funny sense of humor and nothing is immune to her wit.<br /><br />In H IS FOR HOMICIDE, Grafton shows us that no one is protected from corruption and does this in such a way that not only do we find it funny but disgusting at the same time. As always, her characters are, well for lack of a better description, characters. They continuously encompass a wide variety of people from every walk of life that is one of the reasons people can submerse themselves into Grafton's books.<br /><br />Her continuing books revolving around Kinsey Millhone are interesting reading and not the type of books that are a cerebral exercise, but more of a story being told by a master storyteller. They are definitely books to be enjoyed.	2005-04-28

As far as I know, Iris Johansen has only written a few books in the mystery genre but numerous of the romance variety (ok, so they may have been hot and steamy, but the mysteries have much better story lines!). In my opinion, all of these mystery tomes are fantastic and I highly recommend each and every one of them! If I had to pick a favorite one, I'd be hard pressed, as each are unique and utterly captivating. I finished LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT and loved it! Was it better than UGLY DUCKLING or FACE OF DECEPTION or THE KILLING GAME or AND THEN YOU DIE? I can't make that decision but I can tell you that each one of these kept me intrigued until the very end.<br /><br />In LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT, Kate Denby a doctor of genetic research is an unwilling target for competitors who are willing to kill in order to stop the completion of a drug that will change the world. Noah Smith, of J and S Pharmaceuticals, approached Kate to go to work for him and refuses to take no for an answer. The opposition doesn't know or care that she's turned him down. When her ex-husband is killed in a car bombing right in front of her, not so soon after Noah's plant is blasted, she begins to suspect that something is wrong. This begins the story of her run in order to save not only her life, but also that of her young son, Joshua. Iris Johansen throws in a few love entanglements with Kate, Noah and Seth, Noah's best friend. Seth has the responsibility of helping to keep them safe while Noah and Kate try to finish work on RU2, the wonder drug of the future. This is enough to make a wonderful story, but Johansen doesn't stop there. She throws into the mix a diabolical creature named Ishmaru who enjoys scalping his victims. Kate defeats Ishmaru once, but he's on her trail and uses Joshua's safety to play head games with Kate.<br /><br />When things seemed to level out to a steady rhythm, Johansen hurled an obstacle to create another dimension - a realm I hadn't even thought existed. I don't think you'll ever really figure out the entire plot and subplots included in this book until the very end. I thought I had everything worked out in my head and then BAM - a major zigzag was added that gave even more depth to the tale.<br /><br />Iris Johansen has a unique style and you will always be thrown off by an unexpected twist in the book (usually towards the end of it). This is what makes her mysteries more enticing than most writers - she's always trying to keep the reader on his/her toes.<br /><br />This is definitely a \\"stop light book\\" and you'll lose sleep trying to finish this one!

Several times throughout this book, I thought the title gave away the identity of the killer.  Then I wondered why an author would do that... and I continued wondering until the identity was revealed.<br /><br />This tale begins with Cassandra (Jon's wife) being tossed over a balcony, but who did the tossing?  Since Jon is hosting a Mystery Week for charity at his castle in Scotland, it could have been any of the guests in attendance.<br /><br />Heather Graham has a great premise for a mystery but convolutes it with too many characters all of which could be the murderer.  Cassandra was the murder victim and Sabrina hadn't attended the charity function, so those are the only two in the book who didn't have the author's finger pointing directly at them at one time or another.  But Graham does point the finger at the remaining cast:  Camy (Jon's assistant), Joshua (artist), Susan (writer's critic), and the mystery writers - Jon (the host), VJ, Tom, Joe, Brett, Reggie, Anna Lee, Dianne, and Thayer.<br /><br />The mystery game takes place several years after Cassandra's death, and Jon is determined to have everyone return and finally figure out whom the real killer could be.  It's a dangerous game but necessary for his peace of mind.<br /><br />Joshua has created a tableau of famous villains in Jon's dungeon that is part of the mystery game.  Each villain or victim is modeled after one of the guests and it gives all of them goose bumps when they see themselves immortalized in wax.  And so the intrigue begins...<br /><br />The story drags a bit as it jumps from one character to another without a smooth transition.  Sabrina repetitively battles with her ex-husband, Brett, who wants to reconcile.  She tries to ignore the feelings she still has for Jon.  It seems as if all of these guests continue to argue and not get along which made me wonder why in the world they would be invited to a mystery week on a continuous basis.  Why not have people who can get along - that would make for a more enjoyable time.  But that wasn't Graham's intentions.<br /><br />The villain and accomplice are very predictable but Graham continues to try to mislead the reader.  Some of the scenes are so blatantly nonsense, it is easily seen as a chance for misguidance.  But there are other times she makes you wonder if your villain choice is accurate.<br /><br />With no real intrigue, Graham uses a passel of characters to baffle the reader.  In my opinion, it would have been better to use fewer people and delve into the story line a bit more.  There was no reason as to why Jon hosts these Mystery Weeks, no reason as to why this group of people is always invited, etc.  These facts are tossed out and the reader is not to question why.  A few of these would be ok, but there are too many loose ends from beginning to end that are not tied up.<br /><br />NEVER SLEEP WITH STRANGERS is a decent story and average at best.  I much preferred HAUNTED than this one.long - that would make for a more enjoyable time.

The life story of Kay Scarpetta continues, and if it weren't so fascinating the reader would have been bored with this character books ago! Scarpetta is a fictional person we can sometimes relate to and other times we're just in awe of her intelligence and fortitude.<br /><br />In UNNATURAL EXPOSURE, Kay Scarpetta is after a serial killer who plants mutilated bodies to throw those less intellectual off the trail. Scarpetta is led through the scary world of mutant smallpox and the spreading of this disease through common commodities and free offers. Has your imagination ever wondered about that free sample you received in the mail - what if...? Not only does Dr. Kay have to try and figure all of this out; she must piece together the clues left for her in an AOL chat room. (Gee, wonder how much AOL paid Cornwell for the advertising).<br /><br />This book contains the type of story and characters that has made Patricia Cornwell one of the best mystery writers today. She points your imagination in a certain direction and then nourishes it so it can run wild. She mixes enough speculation with real life that as I read, I wondered what was fiction and what was factual. I'm definitely going to have to look into that DataGlove and VPL Eyephone that Lucy gives Kay Scarpetta to take a virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene. That is definitely intriguing, but is it something of today or of the future?<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Cornwell's books, or if you somehow missed this one in the Scarpetta series, grab the first copy you see. I'll bet you won't be able to put it down (just like me)!	2005-04-26

One of the things I love the most about Jillian Hunter's books is her wit. Her sense of humor is evident and often catches the reader off guard causing him/her to burst out chuckling. This sense of humor is again predominant in The Seduction of an English Scoundrel.<br /><br />Grayson Boscastle, Marquess of Sedgecroft, comes to the aid of Lady Jane Welsham when she is disgraced by being left at the alter by his cousin, Nigel. Little did Grayson know that the jilting was an elaborate plan between Nigel and Jane, so the arranged marriage would not happen. Grayson then agrees to escort Jane to try to help elevate her social status so she won't become a spinster. He didn't bargain for the instant chemistry between the two. There are lots of fireworks in this book!<br /><br />Seems Jane and Grayson can't keep their hands (or lips) off each other whenever they are alone, and soon the attraction becomes irresistible and much more than Grayson bargained for. But when Grayson finds out about the ruse of a wedding, he decides to get even with Jane before asking for her hand in marriage. This is where Hunter shines - the banter between the two has the reader actually laughing out a few times. Grayson has a plan to pay back Jane for her deception. Jane finds out about it and turns the tables on Grayson with her own plan for payback. But in the end, all is well in London.<br /><br />The character development is superb. The reader can choose which main character to cheer on - Jane or Grayson - hoping that one outdoes the other's antics. No matter which side you choose, you'll still be the winner in reading this book! We are given glimpses of the inner sides of the characters, as they are developed. We're instantly smitten with Jane's determination to not have her life dictated by her parents. We're enchanted by Grayson who is a lovable rascal trying to do the right thing now that he is head of the family.<br /><br />The plot line was good but on the predictable side. Even so, it is very entertaining and leaves the reader with a smile. The side plots are very funny and keep things interesting. The interlude between Nigel and his wife (previous governess to the Boscastle clan) is absolutely hilarious!<br /><br />This is the first book in a trilogy by Jillian Hunter. If the other two are as much fun to read and as interesting, I can't wait for them to become available! My only complaint is Ms. Hunter needs to write faster, as I hate waiting for the next book to be published. Ok, so maybe I'm impatient, but that's how I am with my favorite authors!

I loved this book and I don't usually like science fiction, but this one was great! It was interesting, intriguing, made me think and, yes, it had a valuable message too!<br /><br />DOOMSDAY CONSPIRACY revolves around Robert Bellamy a commander in the US Navy whose assignment is to find the eleven witnesses of a weather balloon crash. He thinks it's a strange assignment, but off he goes to interview each one of them. He first talks with the bus driver and realizes that it was not a weather balloon that crashed, but a UFO that had two dead alien bodies in it. Then he's off to talk with the next witness. Bellamy soon discovers that each witness is murdered shortly after his visits. So the mystery begins or did it begin pages ago and the reader doesn't realize it?<br /><br />Bellamy discovers that this is a worldwide conspiracy and that in order to solve the puzzle, he must not only find out who is behind trying to keep the UFO a secret, but he must also find the missing alien lurking on the earth.<br /><br />OK, so this sounds kinda hokey, but it's really very interesting, even if Sheldon describes the same alien seen on shirts across America right down to the \\"ping pong ball eyes\\". Sheldon blends the right amount of intrigue with facts. I do admit that most readers will discover the mastermind behind the conspiracy easily, but it is an enjoyable way to spend several days.<br /><br />The lesson it brings forth - stop polluting the earth. Why are the aliens trying to bring this message to the people living here? You'll have to read the book to find out -- I wont' divulge the secret!<br /><br />Sheldon is very graphical in his descriptions of landscape and I could imagine myself at the Swiss Alps or in Hungary enjoying the countryside. If you're not the type to enjoy a very pictorial mindset, then this may not be the book for you, as much of the book is highly descriptive. If you're looking for an interesting blend of science fiction, mystery and even a moral to the story, then you might consider adding this book to your summer reading list!to the story, then you might consider adding this book to your summer reading list! <br />	2005-04-26

She emerges from being poor to a real estate developer worth millions, using whatever is necessary to close the deal, be it her brain or her body. Lara's power revolves around the empire she builds (mainly hotels and commercial buildings) and nothing will stop her. She drugs investors and torments tenants to make them leave property she wants to rebuild. Sound disgusting? Not at all!<br /><br />You'd think with these characters, the reader would hate Lara, but Sidney Sheldon instead shows us her independence, courage and a determination for self-preservation to the point of the reader becoming Lara's ally. The most dramatic evidence to support this devotion is when Sheldon plays on our feelings for Lara during a series of events that could not only leave her penniless but could also convict her of crimes she appears to have committed on her path to the top. Instead of cheering for her demise, I found myself rooting for Lara to once again be successful.<br /><br />Sidney Sheldon masterfully weaves past and present events to give the history of Lara without losing the reader to boredom. The ensemble cast of support characters are not as vivacious as Lara, but still vivid in their own right.<br /><br />This tale has enough intrigue and drama to keep even the most finicky reader entertained. I found it an enjoyable way to spend a few days, much like a walk in the city.	2005-04-26

The Face of Deception revolves around Eve Duncan, a forensic sculptor, who's struggling to live with the murder of her young daughter eight years before. Eve specializes in \\"putting a face\\" to the skulls found by police agencies around the world. She is dedicated to helping victim's parents obtain closure to the nightmare she too has endured, yet has no closure with because her daughter's body was never found. Eve feels closure will elude her until she is able to give Bonnie a proper burial so she has become an expert in order to help others with their own, personal horror of missing children.<br /><br />John Logan, a wealthy computer mogul, hires Eve to help identify a skull he obtained. He's not giving many details about how or where he came to possess the skull and at first she refuses to work for him. He knows which buttons to push to win Eve over to his side and after a large donation is made to her favorite children's charity, she begins. All he tells her is that the skull will be a well-known person and alludes to it being John F. Kennedy. Little does she know that as soon as she sets off on this \\"easy\\" assignment, her life is in danger.<br /><br />So begins the story of Eve Duncan and what a wonderful story it is. The character development was excellent as Johansen introduces us to not only Eve and Logan, but also to Joe Quinn, the detective who's been Eve's friend since he helped investigate her daughter's death. The descriptive passages are so vivid that you can close your eyes and actually see the cornfield she describes, or the lab in which Eve works. The suspense is magnificent and the twists and turns throughout the book are the type that will keep the most avid mystery reader on his/her toes.<br /><br />The reason I didn't enjoy this book as much as other Johansen books was the loose ends that were left dangling. It was almost like reading an Alfred Hitchcock type book - I had many questions that needed answering before I could let go of the story. Then I saw the description of The Killing Game (her book that continues this saga). Ah, that finally explained why all the loose ends were not tied up in neat little bows. It took two books to tell this entire story of Eve Duncan and her quest to find her daughter and both were highly enjoyable. As I finished The Killing Game I understood much more about The Face of Deception. I had all of my answers and could look back at the tale of Eve Duncan with understanding and a feeling of a story well told.<br /><br />I'm at a point where I wish Iris Johansen could write faster. She's written excellent, suspenseful, thrillers and I know I'll continue to pick up a copy of her new books the day they are available. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long in between books, but I guess that's the price I have to pay. It's a small price considering the amount of enjoyment from each of her books, so I'll try to be more patient (even though it's very hard). Hey, anyone have any advance reader's copies???ory.

As Sue Grafton continues her alphabet series, we've seen many changes in the main character, Kinsey Millhone. If you've been with Grafton since A IS FOR ALIBI like I have, you'll notice a more subdued Kinsey in this book. Since Kinsey no longer works for California Fidelity doing all of their investigative work, and her future is uncertain, her usual \\"edge\\" seems to have been dulled.  This is a disappointment - I enjoy the feisty Kinsey!<br /><br />Sue Grafton introduces a new support cast to liven things up a bit as her detective series continues along its journey. Kinsey is hired to take over a seemingly boring case when a local private investigator dies of a heart attack and she must find the facts quickly before the statute of limitations runs out! She stumbles into a \\"whodunit\\" involving a dead artist, a husband tried and acquitted, and an ex-husband screaming \\"foul\\". It's up to Kinsey to figure it all out in the few weeks allowed by the court, and in the process to keep herself safe. This proves to be easier said than done in the writing style that we've come to enjoy and expect from Sue Grafton.<br /><br />One of the things that I enjoy about Grafton is that she not only tells a great story, but at the same time she lays the foundation for future books. After becoming familiar with her writing style, you'll start to pick up on the tidbits of information that she brings out in the open only to read about those same facts in more detail in a future episode. It's almost as if her alphabet series is one very long novel with each letter of the alphabet being a chapter instead of a separate book - these read almost like Kinsey Millhone's diary. But then again, I can see why she's done it this way -- who would buy a book of 8,000 pages or so? It would be a little difficult to carry it to the beach, park or on an airplane!<br /><br />Grafton has created yet another fantastic masterpiece with this tale. She's definitely on a hot streak with this book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat with a few twists along the way until the end!s you on the edge of your seat with a few twists along the way until the end! <br />	2005-04-26

At times I was happy with that referral and other times, I was disappointed. Overall, I feel Sheldon writes a good tale, but I wouldn't consider him one of the best. Maybe it's the weaving in and out of the present and past that isn't what I like, as I'd prefer staying longer than a few pages in one or the other. And it seems this weaving is the style in which he writes most of his books.<br /><br />In THE BEST LAID PLANS, Sheldon tells the story of an American president and his former lover who is now planning on a big \\"payback\\" for him leaving her. Leslie was an executive with an advertising agency when she first fell in love with an attorney, Oliver, who was running for governor of Kentucky. Seems Oliver had a problem being loyal to his female companion and the latest caused a big rift among his supports since it involved jilting a senator's daughter. Leslie and Oliver fall in love and it looks like everything will be wonderful, but it can't be as this is only the first part of the book, so you know there is much more to come.<br /><br />And it does come in the form of the senator striking a deal with Oliver - the deal is if Oliver marries his daughter, he'll make him president. The offer is too good to pass up and Oliver dumps Leslie and he and his new wife enjoy the governor's mansion. Leslie goes to Arizona and marries a wealthy business tycoon who dies a few years later, leaving Leslie not only millions, but also his newspaper and television holdings. Now she has the power for revenge and has had years to plan that revenge.<br /><br />Leslie makes her move buying media outlets in Washington, just in time to witness the new president and his loving wife move into the White House. She begins her own campaign of shedding light on the numerous affairs the new president has had and adds a few new accusations, including murder. The real murderer is exposed on live television -- is it the president or someone else? Is this enough revenge for Leslie or will she continue? I can't tell you or you wouldn't want to read the book!<br /><br />This was a good tale even if it was on the predictable side. There's not much mystery and it isn't full of suspense, but is just a nice piece of fiction that entices the reader to simple follow along.

I haven't enjoyed most of Mary Higgins Clark's latest books, but I have to admit that this was better.  NIGHTTIME IS MY TIME is not as good as her earlier works, but it is enjoyable.<br /><br />Jean Sheridan goes back to her small hometown for a 20th year reunion.  She and a few others will be honored as distinguished graduates - Jean is now a history professor and author of a best seller.  Other honorees include Laura Wilcox, a famous actress; Mark Fleischman a famous TV syndicated psychiatrist; Carter Stewart, a famous playwright; Gordon Amory, a powerful television mogul; and Robby Brent, a sarcastic comedian who people compare to Don Rickles.  Seems each of these honorees had a less than desirable childhood, except for Laura who was the golden child.<br /><br />Jake, a young reporter for the school paper, brings to Jean's attention the fact that of the five girls who sat at the same lunch table growing up, only she and Laura are still alive.  Added to that fact is that they seem to be dying in the order in which they are seated at the table... things that make ya go hmmm...<br /><br />The Owl is on the prowl and has been killing victims for 20 years.  He's almost through - only a few more left until he can avenge the taunting he endured during school especially from the lunch table girls.  Kinda gives a new meaning to the word revenge...<br /><br />Before the reunion festivities are over, Laura disappears.  Everyone is trying to find her before she becomes the next murder statistic.  And the journey becomes more twisted.<br /><br />The plot is a standard mystery theme, but Clark has added numerous side plots in which the reader can become confused.  Jean had given up a baby girl right after graduation, and was now getting faxes threatening \\"Lily's\\" life.  But no one knew that she had been pregnant.  Another side plot involved Alice Sommers, the mother of Karen, who was the first murder victim of The Owl, yet the police had thought it was a random act of violence.  The detective on the case, Sam Deegan, is still looking for Karen's killer.  Other plots are underdeveloped and leave the reader confused - each pertaining to the possible identity of the murderer and involving not only the honorees but also a couple of reunion attendees.<br /><br />Some may like the numerous red herrings tossed about but for me they served little purpose and only added to the confusion.  There were entirely too many characters in this book and many were weak.  There were too many things going on that only added to the mass uncertainty.  It was not a clean storyline.<br /><br />You'd think that in Clark's 29th book, she'd be a pro at churning out wonderful stories.

Jance's book revolving around the life of Joanna Brady, the just-elected sheriff enrolls in a police academy to learn the ins and outs of police work. You'd think this would be a boring premise for a book, but with Jance writing it, it's anything but dull especially when Joanna's classmate is murdered and she's determined to help find the killer. It's not just class lectures and books for her, as she's thrown into the middle of mayhem. While she's learning how to investigate crimes, her new skills are immediately put to the test, as the murder investigation becomes personal since Joanna knew and liked the victim.<br /><br />As a subplot, Joanna does have a few hours of \\"down\\" time and she spends it in a little hole-in-the-wall bar that makes the best cheeseburgers around. Of course sparks fly between the bartender/owner of the bar (Butch Dixon) and Joanna. Jance increases her cast of support characters with the friends Joanna makes in Phoenix and you can be sure that a few will resurface in later books.<br /><br />While reading this I wondered if Jance would have Joanna jump into a new relationship so soon after her husband's death. To me that would have changed the attributes of her main character, and in doing so would have possibly lessened my enjoyment of this series. Joanna Brady's strong emotions, her desire for self-preservation, viability, etc. are a large part of what makes these books so pleasurable. At the same time, when Joanna leaves Phoenix to return to Bisbee, I didn't want to think that she'd never see Butch Dixon again and kept hoping that \\"maybe in the future...\\". (Ok, I'll admit it - I'm a romantic at heart!)<br /><br />This tale is a little different for Jance since it takes place in Phoenix, Arizona instead of Bisbee. I lived outside of Phoenix for almost five years and have to say that Jance's descriptions were extremely accurate. I remember reading this and thinking, \\"I've been there\\". There are a few places that only exist in our imaginations, such as Butch Dixon's bar, but it so closely resembles several others in the area that it could very well be one of them.<br /><br />This is a typical J.A. Jance novel full of wonderful descriptions of not only surrounding areas but also of people in general. There's definitely a few twists and turns along the journey (I'd be disappointed if it were a straight-line venture) and the ending will surprise you.<br /><br />If you haven't read this series, I'd highly recommend that you do so. Many years ago when I had the good fortune to run into this writer in a bookstore she told me that many had compared her to Mary Higgins Clark. After reading her previous work, I agreed with that comparison until this series was published. Now I believe she surpasses Clark in every aspect of what makes a great author!r imaginations, such as Butch Dixon's bar, but it so closely resembles several others in the area that it could very well be one of them. <br /> <br />This is a typical J.A.

Now they need Kinsey back working for them on a tough case and are willing to pay her price. The case itself is a little confusing (and has been overdone by other writers): guy is missing from his boat while sailing on the ocean, leaves suicide note, wife and children are left with nothing, his business partner is put in jail for fraud. Then five years later, he's officially declared dead and his wife receives $ 500,000 from California Fidelity Insurance. Everything seems on the up and up so far, until an insurance agent spots the dead man in a Mexican hotel. Off Kinsey goes to find the evidence so the insurance company can get back its money only to have the guy elude her. Rumor has it that his son is in trouble and she's sure he's back in his hometown to try and help.<br /><br />Sue Grafton had the story line down pat and the characters were born in detail. I'm not sure where she loses her momentum but it's somewhere along the way with this story. It could be in the fact that she's trying too hard to give us glimpses into future books with the bits and pieces of Kinsey's family and not concentrating on the story at hand. The ending is a bit lame and it seems as if she's trying to tone down Kinsey's personality that we've all come to know and love. The story itself is in need of a serious rewrite in order to achieve the greatness that Grafton so often emits.<br /><br />This is still a good book, better than most, but it's starting to go downhill fast and I hope Grafton can get the future books back on track or I may have to stop the alphabet series somewhere along the way. As my daughter said when she was learning the alphabet, \\"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I'm done with this\\" if it doesn't get back to where she was around G is for Gumshoe.re along the way.

With the publication of K IS FOR KILLER, it seems that Grafton's back on the right track to keep her audience on the edge of their seats while reading her books.<br /><br />This Kinsey Millhone story is a little different than we've seen in the past as there's more humor involved, but Kinsey is showing the personality traits that we've all come to know, love and expect from this character. Kinsey is the same tough, funny, take-no-prisoners private investigator that I missed. I hope Ms. Grafton has learned from the past and won't try to tone down Kinsey's personality again.<br /><br />In this tale, a mother believes her daughter's death a year ago is the result of anything but natural causes, which is what the police determined after their investigation.  Not giving up, she hires Kinsey. Kinsey finally agrees to take the case and we're off on a roller coaster ride through her exploration into the death of a secretary who has more money than she should have given her meager job earnings. This ride resembles the newer coasters out there today - lots of twists, turns, and loops, but above all it's a fast, thrilling adventure.<br /><br />This book was reminiscent of the old Sue Grafton, the style that made us fall in love with her writing and heroine in the beginning of the alphabet series. I was beginning to wonder if I could continue after the last few books, but with this one as entertaining as it was, I'm looking forward to continuing along the alphabet journey of mystery.	2005-04-15

I graduated from the University of Redlands (California) with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems degree a few years ago.  Many of the textbooks I used were not very enlightening - I suffered through using them and immediately took them back to the bookstore for resale.  This wasn't so with the CREATING COOL HTML 4 book.  I use this as a reference book now.<br /><br />One of the classes I took included a web design portion.  How fun to create web pages that were exciting and not boring.  It was easily accomplished using this book as a guide but someone who knows nothing about HTML design could easily use this and create.<br /><br />The chapters are broken down from the basics to intermediate items.  The author, Dave Taylor, explains exactly what entails a web page, what a URL is, basic html, graphics, tables, links, pointers, image maps, and other advanced designs.<br /><br />Now many technical books are dry to read and often times leave the non-die-hard techies wondering what was just said.  Not true with Taylor.  He gets everyone to understand html - those creating their first web page to those who want to do more, those that want pizzazz on their pages.<br /><br />If you're not a beginner, you may want to skip the chapters in which Taylor explains to new users about Web pages, how browsers work, what URLs are, and other basic concepts.  (But it can be a good refresher for those who haven't designed web pages in a while).  Next he expands into basic HTML, fonts, text styles, and gets the reader to understand the making of lists, special characters, pointers, and links.  Next comes the explanation of graphics and the creation of tables and frames.  But my favorite part is next - chapters on advanced items like background, marquees, image maps, JavaScript, forms, plug-ins, Dynamic HTML, style sheets, and much more.<br /><br />Examples shown in the book are easy to follow and let the reader completely understand what the code does and how it will look on a web page.  Nothing in CREATING COOL HTML PAGES is overwhelming and will let everyone create a web page of which they can be proud.  I'm a computer programmer, and still use this as a reference.  In fact, it's one of the most borrowed books in our office!  This book is highly recommended for any level of html programmer.page.

This is another great book in the Joanna Brady series by J.A. Jance. This time she throws a little romance into the mix of things as Brianna O'Brien is found murdered and her Hispanic boyfriend is the main suspect for some, while others don't believe he could kill. This teenage girl had many secrets and her boyfriend was only one of them. While investigating this crime, everyone's favorite female sheriff, Joanna Brady, uncovers more than she bargained for and has a difficult time in dealing with some of it.<br /><br />Again, we see some of the cast of support characters return, but others are mentioned in passing, so we know they will be back in future tomes. We're given a little glimpse of what's in store for Joanna Brady with her daughter growing up quickly and her mother's new relationship that seems to have transposed some of the former anger and has made her almost approachable.<br /><br />I find it interesting that Jance not only tells a wonderful story, but throws in a moral issue as well. She deals with the topic of racism in this book and does so in a very civilized way showing the prejudices of some and the extremes they will go to continue that narrow-mindedness. However, she also gives us hope for the future. She shows us that no matter what the odds some will not follow in their parents' beliefs and will, instead, have friends based on things other than the color of skin or social standing.<br /><br />And along with the story line and moral issue, you can always rely on Jance to paint a mental picture of the Arizona desert at it's best. Having lived in Arizona, I can remember the millions of stars in the sky that Jance describes in detail. I can remember the rugged beauty of the various wilderness areas that are similar to those portrayed. No one gives a better mental image of these things than Jance does. Having read all of the books in this series, I feel like I've actually been to Bisbee, Arizona. I'm sure if I ever do get the chance to visit that town; I'll see things as I've seen them before in my mind while reading these novels.<br /><br />After reading the first book in the Joanna Brady series, I didn't think Jance would be able to keep up with the standard she set. I was very mistaken. She has not only achieved that level of excellence but has surpassed it and continues to set new standards with each new book she writes.<br /><br />I highly recommend not only SKELETON CANYON, but any and all books in this series. They're wonderful, exciting and highly addicting! I do suggest that you read them in order to get the background on the characters - it's not mandatory, but will make for a more enjoyable read and will let your imagination run wild with possible scenarios for the future!that town; I'll see things as I've seen them before in my mind while reading these novels. <br /> <br />After reading the first book in the Joanna Brady series, I didn't think Jance would be able to keep up with the standard she set.

The character of Joanna Brady keeps growing on the reading audience and J.A. Jance has created another winner with this series.<br /><br />This book picks up the life of Joanna Brady a few months after her husband was killed and shortly after she's elected as the new Sheriff of Cochise County in Arizona (actually this is the fourth book in the series following DESERT HEAT, TOMBSTONE COURAGE, and SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT). This tale is another fast paced journey into not only Joanna's life as sheriff, but also through her personal life as well.<br /><br />The main storyline revolves around the killing of a veterinarian, Bucky Buckwalter, and the new sheriff is once again tossed in the middle of turmoil. You'd think the murder investigation would be enough, but add in the facts that the prime suspect is a former cop and Bucky had killed the guy's wife a few years before while driving intoxicated and only received a slap on the wrist for his crime. Bad enough? Jance didn't think so, so then she inserts the fact that the two of them have had heated public arguments that Joanna didn't think needed intervention by the sheriff's office. Some in her department, looking for any excuse available to disrespect the new boss, are implying that she was ineffective and basically allowed the murder to happen. Ok, now it's getting more interesting but Jance still doesn't stop. Since all of the evidence conveniently points directly to Hal Morgan (the husband bent on revenge), Joanna feels it's a little too easy and investigates the case herself. Ok, now we have the makings of a great J.A. Jance mystery!<br /><br />If you haven't read this series yet, that could be a good thing. You can begin reading now and when you finish one book you can easily obtain the next line. For those of us who've read each one as they've come out, it can be a difficult wait while J.A. Jance and the publishers perfect the next book. A difficult wait yes, but it will most certainly be worth the time you've anxiously awaited its arrival.anxiously awaited its arrival. <br />	2005-04-15

This is a book by Nora Roberts that I didn't like - I didn't think that was possible, but it happened. I should clarify that remark - the writing was very good, but the research was horrid and I found error after error that made the story very difficult to get through.<br /><br />Lee Radcliffe is a reporter for a celebrity magazine and she's determined to find Hunter Brown, a famous author, and interview him. Hunter is very reclusive and no one knows where he lives or anything about his personal life, which only adds to the determination that Lee find him. She learns that he will be a guest speaker at a writer's convention in Flagstaff, Arizona and she goes to try to finagle a meeting. Little does she know that he was the man in the lobby she spoke with and then to top it all off, she loses him after the seminar. She finally tracks him down and they begin their journey along the romantic path laid out by Roberts.<br /><br />The plot has a few different angles that would have been a nice treat if there hadn't been so many blatant errors in the book.<br /><br />It was obvious that Nora Roberts did very little research into the Flagstaff area or the surrounding area of Sedona. I lived in Arizona for almost five years and have visited both of these places.<br /><br />One mistake was that she has a character land at the airport in Flagstaff (which is a small airport by the way) and driving a short distance to Sedona along rural roads. Actually, to get from Flagstaff to Sedona it takes just under an hour and you travel a good portion of it along I-17 or AZ-89Alt, which is definitely not what I would consider rural roads. Another error is that Oak Creek Canyon is in Sedona not Flagstaff and Roberts' repeated referral to Oak Creek and Oak Creek Canyon outside of Flagstaff became annoying (it's at least 25 miles away). And just to make another point, I'll let you know that the last time I checked, they didn't have direct flights from Los Angeles to Flagstaff - you had to fly into Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and take a commuter hop to Flagstaff. Can you tell that I was annoyed?<br /><br />I can't even give an unbiased opinion on the story line because I couldn't get past the numerous errors pertaining to the geographic location in which the story took place. This is a first for me, but here goes: I'm not recommending this Nora Roberts book. Those that know me understand that I'm an avid Nora Roberts fan and realize how difficult that was for me to say, but I can't advocate something that I know has wrong information in it!

I thought so and then struggled to finish this book - actually I struggled to even read this book after the first 50 pages. John Grisham has outdone himself if he was writing a book that would put you right to sleep!<br /><br />There are actually two plots to this book. The first is about three ex-judges in a federal prison who fabricate a scheme to make them rich men. Their idea was to run an ad in a gay magazine hoping it would attract wealthy men still hiding their sexual preferences from everyone around them. These men would make the perfect candidates for blackmail. These three judges are known as \\"The Brethren\\" because they dispense jailhouse justice for the other inmates at the federal prison. This part wasn't especially made clear as to why or how this whole jailhouse justice thing came about or why it was started in the first place other than to give them a place to meet in private to work on their blackmail scheme.<br /><br />The other plot is about the head of the CIA deciding the next president of the United States and how the CIA manipulates everyone (including the candidate) to ensure that this happens. This plot was a little more exciting and included a few terrorist bombings at appropriate times to make sure the candidate looked like he can predict the future.<br /><br />The two plots meet when Aaron Lake (the presidential candidate) answers the ad for a pen pal using a different identity. Since the CIA is monitoring his every move, they investigate and learn the real story behind the Brethren's blackmail scheme and step in to handle it. In the process, two letters go to the ex-judges that tip them off that someone is tampering with their mail. Then to top it off, Aaron Lake makes a mistake and helps them figure out his true identity.<br /><br />Ok, so it sounds good but it leaves a lot to be desired. I found it boring most of the time and it was very difficult to even finish the book. Many small details were left dangling as to why Grisham decided to portray characters certain ways. For example, why was the CIA director, Teddy Maynard, confined to a wheel chair and in constant pain? I don't remember any reasoning for this and wondered how and why Maynard had become wheelchair bound - was it job related or medical? And why was it so important - it didn't stop him from doing his job. But Grisham made a point that any time Maynard was the focus of the book, he was in pain without giving any further details.<br /><br />And then there's the sub-plot of Buster. Grisham goes into great detail about this character only to have him walk away, literally. Then almost as an afterthought decides to let us know what was going on in Buster's life in the last few pages of the book. It was to the point that I had to stop and remember who Buster was and why was he important.<br /><br />If you've never read a Grisham novel, start with THE FIRM, or another of his more action packed books. Leave this one to the die-hard John Grisham fans, as those are the only ones who will thoroughly enjoy this book.e left dangling as to why Grisham decided to portray characters certain ways.

This story had me captivated from the first page and continued until the last. In fact, I was a bit depressed when I read the last page because I wanted the story to continue.  Too bad this isn't a recent novel with 300+ pages!<br /><br />Famous songwriter, Maggie Fitzgerald, buys a vacant house in a tiny town in Maryland, as far from the public eye as possible. Maggie's husband had died under mysterious circumstances before she purchased the house and Maggie was tired of always being in the public eye.  She was tired of people wondering about her husband's death.  She was tired of always being watched.  She was just tired.<br /><br />The house she bought had been vacant for many years and restoring it to its original state was taking more time and energy than Maggie had anticipated. She hired a local landscaping company and meets the owner, Cliff Delaney, who has more secrets than the house itself. And then the mystery begins. While landscaping, a body is unburied - not a transient's corpse but the body of the previous owner who everyone had thought only missing, not murdered.<br /><br />As a stand-alone mystery this book would fall short as the story is somewhat predictable, and avid mystery readers will figure out the villain about half way through the book. But when you throw in the intrigue and romance, it rounds out to a very pleasurable book. If you're looking for an action packed mystery with lots of guessing as to the murderer, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for a book with a little bit of everything and a pleasant way to spend a few hours, you should get this one!	2005-04-14

I've read several \\"professional\\" reviews written on this book and they basically hate this one. I couldn't disagree more. One reviewer went so far as to say that Kinsey Millhone was so depressed that she went back to Robert Dietz, which was a mistake. Huh? I sure didn't see that one in this book.<br /><br />It's another simple case that turns into something very different. Kinsey is hired to find a missing brother so he can collect his part of the father's estate. What the other Malek brothers conveniently don't tell her is that they also want him dead so they can get all of the money for themselves. The reason this brother has to be found: Bader Malek, the father, sent his son, Guy, away when Guy was a teenager and kept getting in trouble for marijuana, underage drinking, etc. Out of sight, out of mind - that is until he wrote his will.<br /><br />Finding Guy is not the hard part of Kinsey's job. She finds him working as a janitor in a church not far from home and learns he is nothing like the person he used to be. After hearing why Kinsey is there, Guy decides to try to reconcile with his long lost brothers. Not a good idea as he turns up dead a couple of days later. This only irritates Kinsey to the point of her becoming determined to find out who killed Guy and she again is placed in the middle of trouble.  Seems to be her trademark!<br /><br />I'm not sure if the appeal of these books is the no-nonsense character of Kinsey Millhone, or the situations in which Kinsey often finds herself. Maybe it could be the very good \\"who dun it\\" type plot that usually keeps the reader on his/her toes all through the book. The exact fascination of these tales eludes me, I can only hope, along with millions of other Kinsey Millhone fans, which Sue Grafton keeps turning out great novels.<br /><br />Now that she's over halfway through the alphabet, it does make me wonder if she's going to stop at Z is for... or if she'll turn around and start with A is for... again. Hmmm, something to ponder...n. Hmmm, something to ponder... <br />	2005-04-14

This is another good story in the line of alphabet mysteries by Sue Grafton. Her few \\"detours\\" from great writing in previous \\"letters\\" seem to have been a minor bump in the road and she now returns to a good plot and strong characters.<br /><br />I have to admit that one of my favorite characters in this series is Henry Pitt, Kinsey Millhone's landlord and friend. I enjoyed the Henry who wrote crossword puzzles and tried them out on Kinsey before he sent them in for publication. I enjoyed the Henry who always had something baking in his kitchen. And many times I have wondered why some sexy senior citizen hasn't snagged this wonderful catch of a man!<br /><br />This story gives us a little more insight into Henry than we've seen in the past. Henry convinces Kinsey to help a friend of his on a simple matter - she needs to show that Henry's friend served in the military during World War II so he can be buried as a veteran. Such a simple request and it should have a simple solution, but as we've seen with Kinsey in the past, nothing is an easy task, so the plot thickens...<br /><br />The family of the deceased is too busy fighting among themselves to be much help to Kinsey. Then an old friend shows up and gets attacked at the dead guy's apartment.  Once again we're on a race to see what's around the next corner for Kinsey and to find out why the government has no record of this veteran serving his country.<br /><br />There's a little bit of mystery, but more suspense in this book. And more laughs than we've seen in the past with Grafton's other books. I'd recommend this easy read to anyone wanting a few hours of enjoyment as it's definitely one of Sue Grafton's better books in this series. I only hope she will continue with this quality and not hit any more bumps that throw her off to only mediocre writing!	2005-04-14

I have to admit that it wasn't as good as THE KILLING GAME but it was excellent.<br /><br />Many people have said that a certain book has captured them from the \\"first\\" and much of that is exaggeration. This book literally entraps you from page one and doesn't let go until the last page. You'll be on a roller coaster of a ride and the twists and turns don't end until the last few pages.<br /><br />Johansen has continued with the cast of characters she created in THE FACE OF DECEPTION and added a few strong support characters to liven things up a bit. The first two books in this series focused on the life of Eve Duncan, the forensic sculpturer determined to find her dead daughter's murderer. During this journey with Eve, we were introduced to Sarah Patrick and her dog Monty, the search and rescue team that helped Eve in THE KILLING GAME. This book focuses on Sarah and Monty.<br /><br />John Logan, millionaire businessman, once again manipulates Sarah and Monty into helping him - this time to locate a kidnapped employee in the jungles of South America. Little does Sarah know that this is only the beginning of her adventure with Logan, since she was seen by the thug responsible for the kidnapping and destruction of the lab in South America. This sighting makes Sarah and Monty a target and Logan has sworn to protect them at all costs.<br /><br />Iris Johansen leads us not only through this great story, but also gives us glimpses into the work done by search and rescue teams and the valuable contribution these humans and their dogs make to the world. I'm not an expert on search and rescue, but it did seem very real and appeared that Johansen had done abundant research in this field.<br /><br />One of the greatest appeals to Johansen's mystery genre books is the strong female characters portrayed in them. She shows that women can be strong, confident, and self-assured and still be attractive. There's no whining or \\"fainting from the vapors\\" as we've seen in many books. In fact, Sarah Patrick is shown to deal with mass destruction in her job and gives the reader a quick look into how it affects her and how she copes.<br /><br />If you're a mystery buff, this book should be on your list of works to read. I'd suggest first reading the two others in this series (FACE OF DECEPTION followed by THE KILLING GAME) before you get this one. It's not necessary to read the other two but it will give you more insight into the background of the characters and a little more understanding of the many personalities portrayed.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it Iris Johansen doesn't write fast enough.  Someone needs to convince her to burn the midnight oil and get the next one out ASAP! Any volunteers?ured and still be attractive.

This oldest daughter has lots of spunk and attitude like her mother. Her father hires Irish born horse trainer, Brian Donnelly, and the sparks fly between the trainer and the daughter.<br /><br />The plot is standard romance stuff: Man meets woman, they don't like each other much but are attracted physically. They find common ground and begin to see there is more to the other than first thought. They fall madly in love and live happily ever after.<br /><br />The biggest obstacle between Brian and Keeley is the fact that Brian feels his social status is far beneath hers and therefore she is off limits to his heart. This may have been the case years ago, but now? I'm not sure it still applies - it may but it's not as prevalent as decades ago.<br /><br /> What bothered me the most about this story was when Keeley realized she was in love with Brian, she set her mind on making him fall in love with her and in the process lost the personality traits that were the reasons Brian found her attractive in the first place. Keeley morphasized from a strong willed, independent woman into a quiet, reserved woman and went from being innocent to a temptress. I'm not sure how else to describe it but instead of taking on the world, she wanted to wait on Brian hand and foot. Roberts didn't totally blow this story however; she still had glimpses of Keeley's Irish temper that kept us chuckling until the end.<br /><br />This was a nice enjoyable way to spend an afternoon and a time that little thinking was necessary. There is one noticeable editing error that stood out in my mind -- the horse, Bad Betty was referred to as Beth in a very important scene.<br /><br />This isn't one of Nora Roberts' best tales, but it is definitely worth the price of a new romance paperback book.itely worth the price of a new romance paperback book. <br />	2005-04-13

This love is verified by the almost immediate bestseller status upon release of each book. One family that has readers coming in droves to the bookstores is the O'Hurleys, those dancing triplets and their brother, mother and dad.<br /><br />This story features Abigail O'Hurley Rockwell, the quieter of the triplets. Abby married a millionaire/race car driver several years before and had seemed happy to those around her, which proved how talented of an actress she could be. Prior to his death, she wasn't seen in public often, yet her husband made the headlines with his numerous affairs, drunken brawls, etc. Everyone thought that Abby had everything - wealth, fame, etc - but that wasn't what Dylan Crosby discovered when he found Abby on her ranch working hard to just keep the roof over her head. Dylan had come to write a book about her late husband and was expecting to see a jet setter, which only added more mystery surrounding this famous couple and Rockwell's untimely death. Dylan was determined to uncover the truth.<br /><br />This plot outline doesn't sound like much, but has the special charm that only can be found with an O'Hurley and it makes this book a great one! Roberts doesn't disappoint us and has the rest of the O'Hurley clan make an appearance, which brings smiles to those reading. Who can resist Frank O'Hurley and his charisma or any of his children? If you haven't read any of the books about the O'Hurleys, you'll be hooked after you read this one!	2005-04-13

Since her mother's death, she has discovered the truth about him and hopes to smooth things over - her mother didn't portray him very nicely, so Laine has to deal with trying to reconstruct their relationship. While at the airport, she runs into her father's business partner, Dillion O'Brian. After hearing a condensed version of Laine's story from her father, Dillion is sure she only wants money and is obnoxious and downright rude to her whenever her father isn't around. Laine must not only convince him that she's only after her father's affection, but also must try to keep from falling in love with Dillion. UGH - what is with these female characters that fall for the guy treating them horribly?<br /><br />Ok, typical stuff, right? I'll agree but the reader also has a glimpse of Nora Roberts breaking out of the mold with some of the subplots that happen. The character of Laine isn't strong but rather a bit mild and meek, as opposed to what we see in later Roberts books where she's not afraid of making the female leads able to stand on her own. Dillion is the classic handsome, strong macho-man ready to take on the world and protect those he cares about. I personally enjoy the recent leading male roles where they are more rounded in character.<br /><br />This is another non-thought provoking book but an enjoyable way to spend a few hours reading. Since it's fewer than 200 pages, it won't take long to zip through this one.	2005-04-13

Daniel MacGregor, the meddlesome, matchmaking father and grandfather who's family is his greatest accomplishment of all time! This is his story, the story of he and Anna, the wife behind the man.<br /><br />I have to say that I've read several of Nora Roberts's books revolving around the MacGregor clan and have loved each and every one of them. Roberts produced a winner when she created the character of Daniel MacGregor and this vibrant, fun-loving family man has yet to compare with any other fictional creations. Through Roberts's vast and vivid descriptions, a definite mental picture of Daniel is very much etched forever into your mind. His escapades of meddling into his family's love lives has left me laughing and also wishing that I too had a grandfather as vivacious and effervescent as this man.<br /><br />When I found FOR NOW, FOREVER I was thrilled that I'd finally get to read about how Daniel met his Anna, the true love of his life. And I wanted to see exactly what transpired between them to make Daniel believe that everyone should be happily married just like he and Anna. This book didn't let me down and I loved every word of it!<br /><br />The book starts out with Daniel having a heart attack and Anna rushing him to the hospital. She calls the kids home as the dire circumstance dictates (if Anna, a surgeon, was worried, I knew Daniel had to be in bad shape). Then Roberts uses flashbacks to tell the story of how Anna and Daniel met and fell in love. As Anna is waiting in the hospital to see if Daniel will live, she begins remembering the courtship and the ordeals that can only come about when involved with Daniel MacGregor.<br /><br />The reader is shown how Daniel finds Anna and sets his mind on convincing a very independent Anna Whitfield that she can't live without him and must marry him. It's a fun look at how a very dynamic person such as Daniel meets his match in a petite woman with a streak of hardheadedness all of her own. When these two are together you can count on fireworks and they aren't always the romantic type!<br /><br />If you love the numerous MacGregor stories then this is a must read. It will make you understand Daniel and Anna - and it will make you realize that you can still have your individualism and be in a loving relationship. This is the perfect romance story with tons of humor thrown in to balance things.

I'm a fairly new Lisa Gardner fan, having only read her books for a little over a year.  I've devoured her previous works and was anxious to get ALONE, her latest.  It definitely lived up to my expectations!<br /><br />ALONE starts off with the reader learning about a Massachusetts Trouper, Bobby Dodge, who while on duty is called out on a domestic barricade issue. Things go from bad to worse, when Bobby, serving as a sniper for the SWAT team, kills Jimmy Gagnon, a rich abusive, jerk of a guy.  This is done in front of his beautiful wife and son.<br /><br />Bobby is put on administrative leave and learns that he may have been set up to kill the abusive husband.  Could this have been a ploy by Catherine Gagnon to relieve her of the sadistic husband who was getting ready to file for divorce?  The same husband who blames her for their son's sickness.  Added to this, the parents of Jimmy are wealthy and his father is a very powerful judge - both of whom think poor Jimmy didn't deserve to die, even if he was holding a gun on his wife and child.<br /><br />You'd think Catherine had enough to deal with before this situation - she had been kidnapped when she was a child and held for 28 days by a pedophile.  Now she must deal with the death of her husband, a custody fight for her son, the son's mysterious illness, and the unexpected release from prison of the man of her nightmares.<br /><br />Soon people close to Catherine begin to die and the cops and DA begin to suspect that Bobby is involved.  At this point, there are so many support characters it's hard to keep them all clear.  In fact, one character had been introduced at the end, and I was left wondering if I had forgotten her from the previous pages.  Nope, introduced and killed in the matter of a few pages...<br /><br />The action doesn't stop in this book and I read with moderate interest - it was a typical mystery plot.  But Gardner fooled me, 50 pages from the end, a huge plot twist takes place that put me at the edge of my seat.  It instantly went from an OK book to a very good tome.<br /><br />The development of the two main characters (Bobby and Catherine) is excellent.  Some supporting characters are also well developed, but the majority has only minor progress in this area.  The plot is good, but some of the sub-plots could have been weeded out (along with the associated support cast) and it would have been a much smoother read.<br /><br />Having the unexpected plot twist at the end is what made this book wonderful!

This is another of Nora Roberts' earlier attempts at crossing from the romance genre over to mystery. It's a decent attempt, but not as thrilling as some of her latest mystery novels. The romance side isn't as warm and fuzzy as some of her better novels due to the added mystery flare involved in the plot. CAROLINA MOON does much better blending the two genres.<br /><br />NIGHT SHIFT features Cilla O'Roarke, a late-night radio DJ who is receiving numerous threats from an anonymous caller (are there any other kind?). She begrudgingly accepts police protection at the insistence of the company for which she works.<br /><br />Ok, so you can pretty much guess where this story line is leading. Yep, enter Boyd Fletcher a gorgeous, strong cop to save her from the bad guys. Fireworks go off as Cilla is determined to ignore Boyd and she infuriates him with her attitude of not needing him, or anyone for that matter, to protect her. It's the standard plot that has been done repeatedly to the point of saturation. Both characters don't want the other around and then fall helplessly in love. **yawn**<br /><br />The identity of the thug making the calls is predictable for even the most novice mystery reader (I believe anyway) and there are very few surprises along the way. You may be asking why I would recommend this book since it has all of these negatives - the answer is simple: Nora Roberts. She is the best at creating strong characters and describing everything in such lucid detail that the reader can easily become a part of the story. It's a journey through the late night workings of a radio station and the negative aspects that can go hand-in-hand with being a celebrity. The dramatic attributes are not there, but it is still fun to tag along with the main characters!<br /><br />Just a note that this book is followed by Nightshade which tells the story of Boyd Fletcher's partner - another blending of the romance and mystery genres.	2005-04-12

The story is weak and the characters aren't as vibrant as is the usual style of Nora Roberts.<br /><br />This tale surrounds the lives of Mitch Dempsey, comic book hero creator; Hester Wallace, a single mom trying to make ends meet; and her son who just happens to love comic books. Hester and her son move into an apartment in the same building as Mitch and when her mail is delivered to his address by mistake, he takes it to her.<br /><br />This is a standard plot of man meets woman, and their relationship blossoms through the help of the child involved. Nora Roberts is loved for her dynamic characters but these are lacking her normal spunkiness or charisma. They seem bland in comparison to many of her other books.<br /><br />And then there is the plot (plot, was there a plot?). It's weak and we seem to have caught Roberts submitting something that was less than fantastic in order to meet a deadline. Ok, so maybe it wasn't that bad. She seems to have pulled it out of being thought of as garbage by creating a few scenes in the middle of the story that are memorable. One of my favorites is the bank scene with Hester's grumpy, overbearing boss and Mitch.<br /><br />This book read more like an author's first attempt when actually there were several prior to this one - could this be a case of publishing her first book after she's published others? Possibly that could be the answer.<br /><br />The book is a mindless journey with a few fun parts. I'd recommend it if you have nothing else to read and want a few hours of down time. Otherwise, you may want to pick up a different Nora Roberts novel.	2005-04-12

This is another one of Nora Roberts's earlier books and if compared to her writing style of today, you can see she's come a long way. It is still better than many authors of today and is enjoyable so don't count it out just yet.<br /><br />This tale is a bit on the far-fetched side in my opinion. Nathan Powell, an architect who travels the world to see his buildings come to fruition, comes home after such a journey to find a woman in his hot tub. Jackie MacNamara (lovingly know as Jack) has always wanted to write and her cousin talks her into subletting a house while she works. As Jack's in the hot tub dreaming of the next scene with her main male character (the man of her dreams) he materializes before her. Come to find out that this house Jack has sublet is actually owned by Nathan Powell and her sleazy cousin had no right to sublet it to her - he was only trying to make a fast buck. Now she's out the money and has no place to go. Nathan lets her stay for a short while and then the fireworks between them begin. Most can guess the remainder of the story even if you've never read any romance novels before.<br /><br />The character development is not as wonderful as we've come to expect from this author, but Roberts does a fair job as we do get an idea and rough mental picture of Nathan and Jack and what makes them tick. The story development is very predictable and has very few deviations from the standard cookie-cutter romance theme. The most intriguing part is the title of this book - since Jack has fallen in love with Nathan, she's determined to get him to fall in love with her. It's an interesting twist of words.<br /><br />The book is not mind-boggling and a quick read. You could probably finish it in an afternoon.	2005-04-12

It's not a story that requires a lot of time and mind energy but instead takes the reader on a pleasant journey.<br /><br />Adelia (Dee) Cunnane goes to live with an uncle in America after the death of her aunt who she lived with in Ireland. Dee has struggled to keep the family farm and finally agrees to sell it and goes to see her Uncle Paddy.  He's a thoroughbred trainer at Royal Meadows, reportedly one of the finest horse ranches in America. When Dee arrives, she whole-hearted agrees with that account and takes a job as a groomer. She's as happy as she's been in years, until she meets the owner, Travis Grant.<br /><br />They have the usual romantic struggles until Uncle Paddy has a heart attack. Both of them would do anything for Paddy, on his deathbed he asks that they marry so he can die a happy man. They concede, get married, and a miracle happens - Uncle Paddy makes a miraculous recovery (so is he as conniving as Daniel MacGregor?). Dee figures the marriage will end in divorce soon since Travis only married her to make his horse trainer happy. What she doesn't figure into the equation is that Travis has fallen hopelessly in love with her. The rest of the story is how they discover the other's feelings and understand that this is a love that was meant to be.<br /><br />This is a typical happily-ever-after romance but what makes it fun is the interaction between Travis and Dee, who has a temper that won't be leashed. While reading this book, I found myself laughing out loud in some places and smiling in others.<br /><br />Nora Roberts captures the reader's attention with wonderful descriptions of not only Royal Meadows and the surrounding areas, but also of the racetrack and all that goes on behind the scenes. She has created two vivid characters who show up again in the sequel to this book, IRISH ROSE, but only in very minor roles. However, with her Silhouette book, IRISH REBEL, Roberts once again brings Grant and Dee to the forefront.<br /><br />If Roberts continues to write these fascinating stories about the Grants, they could enjoy the popularity that the MacGregor clan now enjoys. For those who aren't Nora Roberts fans, the MacGregors are her most loved fictional family - full of fun, laughs, and pranks. I only hope there are more adventures in store for the Grants in the future.book, IRISH REBEL, Roberts once again brings Grant and Dee to the forefront.  <br /> <br />If Roberts continues to write these fascinating stories about the Grants, they could enjoy the popularity that the MacGregor clan now enjoys.

I met Judy Jance in a bookstore in Palm Desert, California back in the mid 1980's. It was right before Christmas, and my husband had just told me that he didn't have time to go buy a few small stocking stuffer type gifts for me and asked if I'd buy them myself. Needless to say, I was a little ticked by this situation and since he complained about my reading habit, I decided that I'd fix him and buy a few paperback books. I went to Walden Books in the Palm Desert Town Center Mall and was looking in the mystery section for something new that would hold my interest. Up came a lady who asked me if I had ever read any of J.A. Jance's books. I replied that I hadn't and she said that she had been compared to Mary Higgins Clark and I may want to try one of her books. I was amazed, I mean didn't authors have publicists and marketing agents to promote their books - this one was actually promoting her own work (and not even at a book signing event). She signed my books for me (part of the deal I made in exchange for purchasing them!) and I was on my way. My grumbling had ceased to exist and I was a very happy person and glad my husband didn't have time to do his own Christmas shopping. After reading the two books I had purchased, I couldn't wait for the new series she had told me she was writing. Desert Heat was the beginning of that new series and I had to wait almost a year before I could get a copy.<br /><br />This is the story of a woman placed in a very difficult situation and how she is determined to do the right thing, not only for herself but also for her young daughter. The story (and series for that matter) revolves around Joanna Brady who is married and living in a small town in Arizona. Her husband is the county sheriff and killed in the beginning of the book (no I'm not giving anything away, the cover up is the basis of the story, not the murder itself!). Joanna is bound and determined to clear Andy's name and find his killer or killers.<br /><br />J.A. Jance takes the reader on a ride through police crime and corruption and has us realize that no one is safe from abhorrent behavior, even good people. Joanna Brady is a character that most of us can relate to - she deals with everyday situations like her daughter growing up and going through the normal trials and tribulations of childhood or the adjustment from marriage to being a widow. The scenery is very well described and has made me want to visit the little town of Bisbee, Arizona where this series takes place. The supporting characters are interesting and vivid - they will make you laugh, make you cry and make you wonder what in the world makes them tick.<br /><br />This book is a great beginning to a fantastic series.

The MacGregor saga continues and Daniel MacGregor (the matchmaking head of the MacGregor family or clan as he likes to call them) is in his element finding the perfect matches for his three granddaughters. Of course, in his usual style, all parties involved are unaware of the plans Daniel has for their future. The thing I love about any MacGregor tale is the love of life so evident in Daniel MacGregor.<br /><br />The next generation of MacGregors is not immune to Daniel's matchmaking skills and Laura, Gwendolyn and Julia are the targets in this book. The three cousins soon find out what their parents have already experienced first-hand: their grandfather has an infallible knack for finding the perfect partner. He also introduces them and they become \\"involved\\" before anyone realizes that Daniel MacGregor is behind the scenes planning everything.<br /><br />Nora Roberts is at her best when the MacGregors are involved. Daniel MacGregor, in my opinion, is Roberts' most vibrant character of all time. Easily envisioned by the reader are his booming laughter, sparkling blue eyes and penchant for mischief. Roberts has created a character that every reader wishes was an integral member of their own family.<br /><br />Nora Roberts can't get much better in the romance genre than this book! This definitely should be added to your \\"must read\\" list of romance-type books.	2005-04-07
US	51874804	R1J8DAENO5NLYD	0373510098	676786710	Opposites Attract (Silhouette Language of Love #9)	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Not Too Attracting	This is one of the few Nora Roberts books that didn't thrill me. It seemed as if she had too many different subplots, which deterred from the main story line. The characters were well developed, but didn't have the personalities with which the reader could identify.<br /><br />This is the tale of two tennis stars and their on-again, off-again romance. Asher and Ty were opposites and years before it seemed as if they had everything either of them could want - they were champions, they were in love and engaged, and they were happy even with opposite personalities. At least, they were happy until Asher broke the engagement and immediately married another man. The story picks up several years later when Asher is divorced and trying to make a comeback in the tennis world. She's determined to be the #1 tennis player in the world once again and she seems to be on the right course. She's figured out everything except for the way she feels when she sees Ty again and the anger he has towards her throws off her self-confidence. Through a series of events around the tennis courts, the story finally comes out about why and how Asher could leave the only man she ever loved and why she's now back on the circuit.<br /><br />This plot is the cookie-cutter romance story and it seemed as if Nora Roberts couldn't make up her mind as to which villain to place in the story so she throws several into the mix. The ex-husband who sweeps Asher away only to demand that she never play tennis again, who alienates her from her friends and family with lies. Then there's Ty's sister who loves to stir up trouble and has hidden her secrets for years because she's afraid of Ty's wrath if he found out the truth. And the baby... well that's where the story really falls apart and becomes mundane.<br /><br />This is still a decent book for an afternoon of relaxing. It won't leave you with any lasting impressions but will be somewhat enjoyable while you're reading it.	2005-04-07

There's no grace period for the newly elected Sheriff Joanna Brady. She isn't being eased into the job but instead is thrown into investigating the murder of a prominent citizen of Bisbee, Arizona. In the process of trying to solve the crime, Joanna must sort through the victim's family secrets and dirty laundry. It's once again a race against the clock to find the killer before he strikes next. You'd think this would be enough for any new sheriff, but Joanna Brady must also deal with the resentments of long-time employees not happy with the changes she's bringing to the sheriff's office.<br /><br />Still not enough on her plate, Joanna must go home and deal with family issues revolving around the recent death of her husband, Andy, the former Sheriff of Cochise County. Issues like helping her daughter, Jenny, deal with the loss of her father, or trying to keep her overbearing mother at arm's length.<br /><br />JA Jance has created a main character to which every working mother can relate - she's overwhelmed at times and just trying to do the best she is capable of doing. Surrounding Joanna Brady is a cast of support characters who invoke a wide range of emotions from the reader. The mother is one who frustrates, the daughter seems cuddly and a typical child, the in-laws are gifts from heaven, everyone wishes Reverend Marianne were their friend, and many will wonder how the sheriff's receptionist could qualify and be hired for her job.<br /><br />Reading a JA Jance novel, with a couple of exceptions, is like becoming part of the series' family. You'll laugh, cry, become frustrated, etc. You'll live the book. It's a subtle way of drawing you into the story with both the familiar characters and the great plots.<br /><br />Absolutely an addition to your must read list but I do recommend reading this series in order. Don't get me wrong, it's not mandatory to do this but doing so will give you the history of the entire group and make each new book much more enjoyable and that much harder to put down!ble and that much harder to put down! <br />	2005-04-07

More of an Illusion	This earlier attempt by Nora Roberts just misses the mark of excellence, and falls to below average. It seems as if she's not sure the direction she wants this book to take and the results are not up to what I've come to expect from this fantastic author.<br /><br />Pierce is a mysterious magician who not only keeps his performance secrets closed from everyone, but he also closes everybody out from his personal life. Ryan comes into his life and not only shatters that wall of privacy Pierce has built around himself, but worms her way into his heart as well.<br /><br />While reading this, I had mental visions of David Copperfield crossed with a modern-day mad scientist living in a dark, remote castle. The characters and scenes seemed to evoke images of other stories we've all read sometime in our youth. One example is the Great Houdini Escape illusion that so many have tried and failed to complete. Another example is the dark castle with Igor as Frankenstein's only true friend - yep, there's a couple of scenes that reminded me of these taken from long ago movies and books. These occurrences are included in the story and unfortunately are done so with no flare or vigorous changes. They left me feeling \\"been there, done that\\".<br /><br />If you're looking for a feel good romance with little or no originality then you'll love this book. If you're looking for something new and dynamic then steer clear of this one! I'd only recommend this for those needing to finish a book and say, \\"Ah, wasn't that nice...\\"	2005-04-07

Don't get me wrong, I'm not downcast from the story itself, it was so well written that I wanted the story to continue. The fact that there weren't thousands of pages was the let down, not the content.<br /><br />This is the tale of Tory Bodeen, who has endured a childhood that would break most people. When she returns to the small town of Progress as an adult, she must face her past including the murder of her best friend when she was only a young child. She must also face people's scorn towards her ability to \\"see\\" events both long ago and present even when she's not physically in attendance. She's not necessarily a psychic (our definition is different than what she experiences) -- she feels what people feel, she doesn't just get a glimpse at the scene.<br /><br />Nora Roberts has once again blended romance and mystery to create a book that readers will enjoy. Her main characters are vibrant and the reader can easily relate to them. Tory's romantic interest, Cade Lavelle is the type of man who frequents every woman's dreams. He's handsome, sensitive, strong and romantic. At times, Roberts' supporting characters over-shadow the main duo, but not in an annoying way. It reminds me of a walk through town and the many interactions that go on every day in a small town where everyone knows everyone else - these constant interactions are present in this story.<br /><br />Unlike SANCTUARY or THE RIVER, the mystery portion of CAROLINA MOON isn't strong. Instead this one leans more toward the romantic side of the combination of genres.<br /><br />CAROLINA MOON illustrates why Nora Roberts dominates the literary market with bestseller following bestseller. She captivates her audience with a great plot, strong cast of characters, interesting town as a backdrop, mystery and romance. Nora Roberts's fans won't be disappointed and those new to Roberts' work will be addicted to her unique writing style.	2005-04-07

Yes, at one point while reading, I had to wipe tears off of my face and rub my eyes so I could see the printed words. Ok, so I may be emotional, but Patricia Cornwell knows how to bring the sentiments of her readers to the surface. And just to clarify a major point (and save a little of my credibility) I've had others admit that they shed a few tears while reading this book too! So there, you can be assured that I'm not a crybaby (at least most of the time) it's just that this book really moves people.<br /><br />Dr. Kay Scarpetta is again on the trail of Temple Gault and his one time accomplice Carrie Grethen. This is a personal thing with Scarpetta since the dastardly duo tried to set up her niece Lucy and used Lucy's passion as part of a psychotic game in THE BODY FARM. Scarpetta has a new role, one of consulting forensic pathologist for the federal government (just how many hats can that lady possibly wear?). She's called to investigate a horse ranch that had been burned to the ground, and a body found in the ruins. As Scarpetta is on the heels of this pyromania killer (Gault and Grethen or someone else?), her usual cast of support characters surrounds her. We again see Benton, Lucy, and Marino at their best (and worse) so that a vivid picture of who they are and what makes them tick is forever established in our imaginations.<br /><br />The main thing that makes this book memorable is the emotions this story brings to the surface. We see each of the characters as we've never seen them before and it makes it much easier to relate to some that Cornwell has kept at arm's length from the reader.<br /><br />True to her fans, Patricia Cornwell doesn't disappoint with this work. It's graphic, emotional and thrilling, as we've come to expect from this writer who is setting the standard for mysteries in the future. It's almost impossible to put this book down and turn the light off to go to bed!	2005-04-07
US	51874804	R3DF1VRJAKL4GW	0553278592	140699390	Sweet Revenge	Books	4	8	8	N	N	The Princess Thief	This is another Nora Roberts book that blends the romance and mystery genres (something that she does well lately). The result is an exciting edge-of-your-seat romance that has a little bit of everything to keep even the pickiest reader entertained.<br /><br />On the surface Princess Adrianne seems to have everything a rich girl could want and even those close to her don't know the truth. They don't know what she endured as a child in the country of her birth, or the fact that she is now an international thief. She remembers all too well the cruelty her mother endured at the hands of her famous father and she wants to avenge that brutality. She's had many years to plan her revenge and has figured out the worst possible way to hurt her father: she plans on stealing a priceless necklace that he worships. On the way to extract her retaliation she meets a man who could ruin her carefully laid out plans. Phillips Chamberlain has his own agenda and Adrianne is part of them, only she doesn't realize it.<br /><br />When the two meet her father, everything changes. Each of them still wants the necklace but they didn't expect to fall in love with each other along the way. Nor did they plan on the King, Adrianne's father, providing them with a marriage ceremony.<br /><br />It seems as if this plot has been used several times, but Nora Roberts excels at bringing the romance, mystery and intrigue together in the perfect mix. I'm not sure which Roberts does better - the pure romantic fiction or the blending of the genres. My personal preference is the melting pot that seems so popular now. This could be why I enjoyed this book so much. But then again, it could be that this books showcases many reasons Nora Roberts is at the top of the list of romance writers in America.<br /><br />There's not much to figure out with this story in the way of mystery. You'll only speculate on whether or not Adrianne and Phillip can escape her father's country with their lives. And if they do, will they have the necklace with them?o, will they have the necklace with them? <br />	2005-04-07

I'm not entirely sure if Roberts is better at writing romance or mystery stories, but I do know that I enjoy both genres written by her.<br /><br />Autumn Gallegher goes to her aunt's B & B for a visit only to find a handful of eccentric guests and an ex-boyfriend with whom she is still madly in love even if she refuses to acknowledge that fact. Several of her aunt's guests are there on a working vacation. Lucas, her ex-love interest, is finishing a screenplay and the producer and lead actress are both on hand in case he needs their input. This aspect seemed like a strange idea, but what the heck, it's Roberts' story, so I just followed along and didn't question that too much since these characters were fun and added spice to the story line.<br /><br />When one of the guests is killed, Autumn takes it upon herself to figure out \\"who dun it\\"! Seems as if all of the guests were being blackmailed by this despicable excuse for a human. Even though I enjoyed this tale, it really reminded me of playing the game \\"Clue\\". Who committed the murder and what was the murder weapon of choice seemed to be the prevalent questions in this story. The butler did it in the library with a knife - oh, sorry, there is no butler in this story, I just got carried away for a moment.<br /><br />Ok, so maybe it wasn't that black and white, after all Nora Roberts had to weave the romantic side of the story into the plot. This was the part that played like a country western song. He did her wrong but she never stopped lovin' him. He says he's sorry and wants her back and she is willing to begin where they left off until... Ah, then Roberts jumps back to the game of \\"Clue\\" as the murderer decides that Autumn may know the identity of the killer and is determined to eliminate her as well.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention that while all of this is going on at this remote bed and breakfast, a huge thunderstorm has pounded the inn, all power is knocked out, and the road is washed away so no one can escape or summon the sheriff. I've always wanted to own a bed and breakfast resort away from town in a semi-isolated area and after reading this story, I've realized that there are several reasons that this wouldn't be a good idea. While I was enjoying this tale, I could perfectly imagine the setting as I've dreamed of this inn for many years and Nora Roberts brings about a vivid mental image.<br /><br />This is actually a fun book and is a quick read. It will only take a few hours to get through this one and will have you reading and playing along with Autumn to find the identity of the real killer.hile all of this is going on at this remote bed and breakfast, a huge thunderstorm has pounded the inn, all power is knocked out, and the road is washed away so no one can escape or summon the sheriff.

Bailey James appeared like a timid beauty with one major problem - she couldn't remember anything, not even her identity. She stumbled into Cade Parris' office after picking his name out of a telephone book. She knew her life was in danger, but didn't know who was after her or why they were after her. The only thing in her possession was a blue diamond the size of a fist.<br /><br />Of course Cade Parris had seen all kinds of people come through the door to his private investigating office, but the instant he saw Bailey, his heart was lost. He felt as if he had been waiting for her his entire life. Now if he could only be certain that she wasn't a murderer, or married, etc. He decided to go to any length to find the answers to this puzzle, no matter what the outcome.<br /><br />HIDDEN STAR  is definitely a piece of romantic fiction but has strong undertones of mystery. The web Nora Roberts weaves around the lives of Cade Parris and Bailey James (don't you just love that name?) leaves the reader enthralled with the entire story. The time spent reading this book is definitely enjoyable but it will be addicting. I read this entire book in one afternoon and luckily had SECRET STAR, the next book in the series, on my shelf. But it didn't stop there - I immediately went on the search for CAPTIVE STAR, the final book.<br /><br />Nora Roberts' trilogy books have taken on an identity all their own. Her single books are excellent, but it seems as if her trilogies have gotten to the point that her devoted fans go into a feeding frenzy when the next book in a series hits the stores. How does THE STARS OF MITHRA  compare to her more recent trilogies? THE STARS are very good, but not her best in my opinion. Her later trilogies have more character development and more wit, although the creation of the character of M.J. O'Leary (one of Bailey's friends) is a masterpiece.<br /><br />If you've never read any of Roberts's books, I'd recommend the CHESAPEAKE BAY trilogy or MACKADE BROTHER trilogies before this one.iends) is a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />If you've never read any of Roberts's books, I'd recommend the CHESAPEAKE BAY trilogy or MACKADE BROTHER trilogies before this one. <br />	2005-04-06

If you read my review on PLAYING THE ODDS or if you've actually read that book, you'll know the story behind Mac's parents meeting. If not, here's a brief synopsis: Daniel MacGregor (Serena's father) once again puts his matchmaking skills to work and \\"introduced\\" these two. Justin is a gambler and owner of a casino. Serena has taken a brief \\"tour\\" as a blackjack dealer on a cruise ship. They meet and the rest is MacGregor history. (I said brief!!)<br /><br />Like I stated, Mac is Serena and Justin son and has the job of running one of several casinos owned by Justin and Serena. Mac has a very hands-on type approach to running the casino and knows exactly what's going on at any given time monitoring everything from either the bank of windows from his office or the many security camera monitors lined up nearby.<br /><br />Darcy was having the worst day in her life, actually the worst several days. Her car broke down several miles outside of Las Vegas and she walked into town in the blazing sun. She was dazed, hot, dehydrated, and looked like she could use a shower and clean clothes when she stumbled into Mac's casino. She then took her last dollar and played it on one of those million-dollar-winner-type slot machines (you know the big ones in the entries to many of the casinos). Sure enough, she hits the million-dollar jackpot and then politely faints right into Mac's arms. Ok, sure it sounds like something that can never happen to the \\"normal\\" person, but hey, we can dream can't we?<br /><br />Mac feels like he needs to take care of Darcy since she won the money in his casino until she gets on her feet and has her stay at his rooms above the casino. (Did I mention that he takes his job very seriously?) I'm sure most of you can see where this is heading, but don't stop reading here...<br /><br />Of course they fall in love and the rest of the book is devoted to how Darcy and Mac resolve various issues and how they become business partners - just like Serena and Justin had years earlier. Just when things look like it will be smooth sailing, Darcy is kidnapped and Mac is beside himself. This kidnapping coincides with Justin and Serena's visit which has both of them reliving Serena's kidnapping. In fact, PLAYING THE ODDS and THE WINNING HAND almost seem to parallel each other!<br /><br />You're probably wondering if I'm going to recommend this book or not. You're also probably thinking that this is a weak story line and not a book that you'd be interested in reading. Well, if you want to laugh out loud, smile continuously while reading, and just have a good time, then this is a book you need to purchase, borrow or find with any other means available! This has become one of my favorite of Nora Roberts' romance type books - it's fun, refreshing even with a story line that has been done over and over again, and of course Daniel MacGregor puts in an appearance to spice things up.<br /><br />Now on the negative side, it is a quick read with only around 200 pages, not filled with much new material and at times seems redundant. It's also a little unbelievable at times - I mean who has actually gambled their last dollar and won a million dollars and then had the gorgeous owner of the casino decide to take care of you?

TEARS OF THE MOON is the second book in Nora Roberts' trilogy and was released to the much awaited anticipation of her devoted fans. (Ok, I'll admit that I'm one of those devoted fans and was in line to get this book!).<br /><br />JEWELS OF THE SUN began this series with the story of Jude Frances Murray and Aidan Gallagher. Now TEARS OF THE MOON picks up with a different Gallagher, Shawn, the quiet songwriter who is the cook in the family-owned and -run pub in Ardmore, Ireland. Shawn is content with his life and has no great ambitions until his lifelong friend, Brenna O'Toole, makes him an offer that not only changes their relationship, but everything else in his uncomplicated life. Seems Ardmore is in for lots of changes in the near future but I can't give them all away or you won't need to read the book.<br /><br />Nora Roberts has woven the Irish myth of a fairy prince named Carrick and the love he lost - a mortal named Lady Gwen, around the story of the Gallaghers. In JEWELS OF THE SUN we learned that Prince Carrick tried to woo Lady Gwen with Jewels of the Sun (diamonds). When he spread them at her feet, asked her to leave the mortal world and come with him, she turned her back and the jewels became flowers. Carrick then brought Lady Gwen the Tears of the Moon (pearls) and once again laid them at her feet only to be refused once more. Finally, Carrick brought her the Heart of the Sea (emeralds) and laid them at her feet and was refused a third time. Seems Lady Gwen wanted him to voice his love for her, not give her jewels in place of the words. Carrick was angry and placed a spell on both of them - they cannot reunite for 300 years and until love has been given and accepted three times. Until this time, Lady Gwen is a very heartbroken ghost who lives in Faery Cottage. Both Lady Gwen and Prince Carrick can be seen occasionally and those seeing them are the envy of many in the town of Ardmore. In JEWELS OF THE SUN love was given and accepted with Jude and Aidan, which meets one of the requirements of the spell. Now with TEARS OF THE MOON love will be given and it's up to Prince Carrick and Lady Gwen to make sure this love is also accepted to meet the second portion of the spell.<br /><br />I absolutely love the way Nora Roberts mixes Irish lore with her \\"modern day\\" story. I'm wondering if Ms. Roberts has visited Ireland numerous times or if she has family there. Her understanding of the many Irish customs and her descriptions of the land have always instilled a vivid mental picture and have increased my desire to visit this country.<br /><br />When reading this passage, I envied the person building a house on this piece of land and longed to actually be standing and looking myself:<br /><br />\\"The price was as steep as the lay of the land, but Shawn liked the feel of it. As he stood in what was no more than a drizzle now, he could see the water from one direction, stone gray to mirror the sky, and calmer now. The storm had died in the night, but the beach was littered with shells and kelp and debris that had been heaved out of the sea. He imagined they would face the house that way, with at least one good-size window in the front room so they could watch the moods of the water. In back there was the rise of distant mountains, shadowy bumps up into the cloudy sky. Then on either side was the fall of hills and fields, the deep, wet green shimmering through winding ribbons of mist...\\" Oh yes, this would be an ideal place for anyone to build a dream home and I only could wish for a place as lovely!<br /><br />As always, we see the wit and humor of Roberts' characters in the tomboy Brenna (the only one to have broken Shawn's nose in a baseball game). Shawn doesn't hold that against her and falls fast and hard for this compact tigress. The journey of their romantic escapades is filled with love, laughter and reflections. It's a journey that you won't want to miss.dan, which meets one of the requirements of the spell.

He imagined they would face the house that way, with at least one good-size window in the front room so they could watch the moods of the water. In back there was the rise of distant mountains, shadowy bumps up into the cloudy sky. Then on either side was the fall of hills and fields, the deep, wet green shimmering through winding ribbons of mist...\\" Oh yes, this would be an ideal place for anyone to build a dream home and I only could wish for a place as lovely! <br /> <br />As always, we see the wit and humor of Roberts' characters in the tomboy Brenna (the only one to have broken Shawn's nose in a baseball game). Shawn doesn't hold that against her and falls fast and hard for this compact tigress. The journey of their romantic escapades is filled with love, laughter and reflections. It's a journey that you won't want to miss. <br />	2005-04-06

In this earlier romance novel by Nora Roberts, we're introduced to a tiny bit of the edge-of-your-seat drama that is prevalent in some of her recent works.<br /><br />Liv Carmichael and T.C. Thorpe are rival reporters in the television news game. A typical love story with the normal plot that has been done over and over again: Woman meets man. In this case they have known each other for a few years, as they are always trying to beat the other to the story and be the first on the air to tell their viewing public about the latest headline-making news.<br /><br />They deny their love/attraction. Liv denies the attraction, but T.C. just seems to go with the flow of things. Liv doesn't want to be involved with her competition and is afraid a relationship will slow her killer instincts when it comes to her job.<br /><br />Circumstances bring them together. This is the part where the book becomes interesting. T.C. is taken hostage and the nutcase holding him makes demands using T.C.'s safety as the negotiating factor in meeting those demands. Liv is torn between getting the story and helping to rescue T.C. Like all good romances, love wins in the end. Ah, isn't that sweet?<br /><br />This book is a no-brainer as it is an easy read and you don't have to think much about the plot lines, etc. I've heard the term \\"throw away books\\" used to describe these paperbacks with between 125 and 200 pages and I feel that's an apt description of this one. You'll be able to read this in a couple of hours so it won't interfere much with your busy schedule. It's not a masterpiece, but it is kinda fun!	2005-04-06

UNTAMED  is a bit of a different story line for Nora Roberts and as an avid reader of her books, I found myself perplexed. I usually enjoy escaping the stress and deadlines in my life for a short while by becoming absorbed in the fictional book currently in my hands. With UNTAMED  I just kept wondering WHY? - there was no escape for me in this one.<br /><br />Jo Wilder comes from a long line of lion trainers and has made it to center ring when the new owner of the circus shows up to review the business aspect of the show. Jo, along with many of the other long time performers are worried that Keane Prescott will sell the circus or even disband it. She decides to try to convince him that the circus is more a family than a business and is frustrated by Keane's entire attitude.<br /><br />She convinces Keane to travel with them and see first hand the excitement that can only come from being involved in a small-time circus like this one. Jo begins to think that he is softening towards her but after her performances with the big cats and her no-fear attitude, he puts the shield up once again. She can't figure it out and continues to wonder. Yep, it's the old \\"does he love me or not\\" plot. I won't give you any more details or the outcome since it doesn't have a lot going for it, you might as well be surprised with the ending! (By the way, I found the ending to be out of character for Jo, and it seemed as if Nora Roberts had to hurry and end the story so she threw it together at the last minute with little forethought).<br /><br />Even though the story is mundane, there are a few touching scenes in this book. One of the best passages is when Jo is comforting her oldest lion. She's known for some time that he's ill and not going to live much longer. She makes the decision one night to end his suffering and euthanizes him. The warmth and compassion shown for this animal can be a prime example to many humans on how to care and open their hearts to other living things (human and animal alike). This is a great glimpse at what a human can accomplish if they open their heart and care.<br /><br />Other than that, UNTAMED is weak on plot and subplots. Nora Roberts misses the boat with the opportunities to create unforgettable characters and has mediocre ones for the most part. Can you image the subplots when you could choose from the trapeze family, the circus clowns, roadies, etc.? My mind was in overdrive trying to fathom the possibilities. Unfortunately, Ms. Roberts's didn't come through on this aspect.<br /><br />I'm not really sure if I recommend it or not - I guess I do, after all there is a lot of garbage on the market nowadays. It's a thin book and will only take a couple of hours to get through so you wouldn't be spending tons of time with it. If it consisted of several hundred pages, I have to advise against it. How's that for waffling?uman and animal alike).

The MacGregors were one of Nora Roberts' creations that surpassed excellence. These family members are fun, witty, strong natured, hardheaded, and a joy. I can't think of another fictional family that I've enjoyed more than the MacGregors and their extended family.  These characters have made every book written about them fun to read!<br /><br />In THE PERFECT NEIGHBOR, Cybil Campbell is extended family, after all the Campbells and MacGregors have a long history together. Her being extended family does not mean she's immune to Daniel MacGregor's matchmaking prowess. Daniel, the patriarch of the MacGregor clan is the best at what he does, be it business or making sure his family is all married, happy, and continuing the family line of MacGregors. He's an expert at harmonizing his family members with the perfect match, even if they don't think so in the beginning.  Their blissful happiness usually changes their frustration at his interference.<br /><br />Daniel places Preston McQuinn, a quiet loner, right in the path of Cybil, whose bubbly and outgoing personality could either overshadow or compliment McQuinn. That's the difference between Daniel and other do-gooders - Daniel just places the people in each other's paths and lets magic happen. And since Daniel owns an apartment complex, he can't be held responsible if two tenants would be perfect for each other and he just happens to place them in close proximity.<br /><br />The magic begins when Cybil mistakes Preston as being unemployed and tries to hire him as her escort. For some reason, Preston agrees and Nora Roberts then takes the reader on a journey of fun and laughter, ok there is romance too!<br /><br />Daniel MacGregor has a perfect matchmaking record and no one, Cybil and Preston included, can deny that he's the best in the world at pairing people. I'm wondering if this is a talent that's gotten better with time, or if Daniel MacGregor is the male reincarnation of Venus, the Goddess of Love?/>	2005-04-06

PLAYING THE ODDS  is another in the MacGregor family saga and yes, the famous matchmaking Scot, Daniel MacGregor, is involved once again.<br /><br />Daniel's daughter, Serena, had decided to escape the responsibilities that go hand-in-hand with her family and became a blackjack dealer on a cruise ship named Celebration. She only wanted a couple of years to enjoy life and see the world. She figured this was an excellent way to do so. After letting his daughter enjoy her freedom for a bit, Daniel decided it was time for Serena to help continue the family bloodline and get on with her life. He arranged for her to meet the man of her dreams. The only problem was that Serena didn't know she had a man of her dreams.<br /><br />As is Daniel MacGregor's style, he doesn't interfere per se, he just places two people he thinks are perfect for each other in close proximity and lets the magic of romance take over from there. He's batting 1000, so he must be doing something right. I'd like Nora Roberts to spend a little more time in the mind of Daniel MacGregor. I'd like to see just how Daniel figures out who is right for whom and how he knows things will always work to his expectations. Is it magic or an insight that is rare?<br /><br />After some thought, Daniel decided that one of his business associates needed a vacation. Since he was the perfect man for his daughter Serena, he encouraged Justin Blade to take a cruise to relax. Daniel figured that since Justin was a gambler and owner of a casino, he would just happen to visit the onboard casino once or twice and that would all it would take to get this romantic escapade on it's way.<br /><br />What Daniel didn't expect was that Serena would not want to marry Justin right off, but instead work with him at the casino for awhile. Serena didn't want to gamble with her heart and decided the situation needed more time to evolve.<br /><br />During this evolution, an old enemy of Justin's with a debt to pay makes an appearance and kidnaps Serena. Justin does everything in his power to get Serena back and Daniel is beside himself with worry.<br /><br />Ok, that's it, I'm not telling you the ending, you'll have to get a copy of this one and read it for yourself!

He's divorced and struggling to make it as a private investigator.  His first case has him reassessing his life.<br /><br />This story has semi-transparent story-lines with a few twists and turns along the way. Character development is very good, almost to the point of over doing it. Some twists and turns seem like detours that are unnecessary and only served to fill up blank pages. All are typical errors from a 1st time writer, but Parker does so without leaving a bad taste in the reader's mouth.<br /><br />If the strong character development wasn't as excellent as indicated, this would be the only book many would read. Having Tom Shepard as a normal guy-next-door type has the reader anticipating his next escapades.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading it quickly and moving on to the next book in this series.	2005-04-05

He remembers re-enacting battles fought during the civil war in the woods near his family home and wrestling with his three brothers, Rafe, Shane and Devin. Those childhood memories and upbringing are the core of Jared MacKade.<br /><br />Rafe, the oldest brother was now married, and that left the others still on the family farm. Life was good and easy with few complications and that's just how Jared liked it. At least it was uncomplicated until Savannah Morningstar moved into town.<br /><br />Savannah and her son, Connor, moved to town and kept to themselves. She did little socializing so the rumor mill had nothing on her, which left Jared with little information to prepare for his first encounter with her. He had to contact her regarding Savannah's father's will and wasn't sure how to handle it. He was more than surprised that she was not only drop-dead gorgeous, but independent and stubborn as well. When he told her that her father was dead, she didn't have any reaction. Then when he told her that she had inherited some money from him, he was amazed when she politely refused it.<br /><br />That wasn't the only surprise Savannah had in store for Jared. She didn't instantly fall for Jared like most women and it seemed as if she was immune to his good looks and charm. In the process of performing his lawyerly duties and informing her of her inheritance, he was attracted to her. He wasn't sure if it was his pride that kept him in contact with her, or something else. In the process, his life was turned upside-down and he loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Yes, this is a typical romance story line, but typical to Nora Roberts' writing style, we find strong characters that aren't afraid to have their personalities clash once in a while, which makes it very interesting for the reader. The character of Savannah does not have the typical bitter \\"you done me wrong\\" type attitude, but instead has let adversity maker her stronger. The character of Jared doesn't portray the normal \\"I'm gorgeous and know it\\" attitude, but when his ego takes a direct hit, he builds on it instead of running to someone else who will stroke that ego. I think that's what makes this book so enjoyable and fun.<br /><br />The Pride of Jared MacKade is the second book in the MacKade series coming after The Return of Rafe MacKade. It is followed by The Fall of Shane MacKade and The Heart of Devin MacKade. I've read all four of these books and found each of them to be well written with fun interactions not only between the four brothers, but also between the female characters and townspeople. There's nothing cerebral about this story, or any of the MacKade stories for that matter, but they're very enjoyable and you'll find yourself smiling throughout each of them.bitter \\"you done me wrong\\" type attitude, but instead has let adversity maker her stronger.

I had previously read, and thoroughly enjoyed, THE GUARDIAN  by John Saul and was anxious to start another by this author.<br /><br />Although I didn't enjoy THE HOMING as much as THE GUARDIAN, it brought out many emotions even if it did go into extreme detail on a wide variety of insects. I'll never look at another bug in the same way again.<br /><br />While reading, I learned that homing is an insect instinct that leads them home. You can't move a beehive within 5 miles from the previous location or the bees will return to the previous hive location hovering over the empty spot until they drop dead of exhaustion. I also learned more that I ever wanted to about larvae, pupae, etc.<br /><br />Karen Spellman grew up in Pleasant Ville located outside of San Luis Obispo. After attending her high school reunion, she falls in love with a former classmate, Russell Owen, and they decide to get married. Karen with her two daughters, Julie and Molly, move from Los Angeles ready to live a happily ever after type of life. From the day of the wedding, marital bliss eludes them as one tragedy after another surrounds them.<br /><br />On Karen's wedding day, Molly (her youngest daughter) is stung by a bee and has an allergic reaction. The local doctor's anti-venom doesn't work and they fly to San Luis Obispo in a friend's plane. New, experimental anti-venom is given to her and the symptoms instantly subside. Dr. Ellen Fillmore, Pleasant Ville's local doctor, asks for some of the anti-venom to have on hand for future needs, and so the evil begins...<br /><br />The real anti-venom is substituted with a serum that harbors insects in the host's body until they multiply to the state that they are expelled into another host. Sounds pretty gruesome, huh? It is and it gets worse. Since Molly was given the real anti-venom she isn't affected, but when her older sister, Julie, is stung, she is given the substitute and many changes begin to take place. Julie in turn infects some of her teenage friends and the horror is multiplying faster than you can imagine.<br /><br />Saul creates many believable support characters all eagerly trying to find answers to the many questions raised in this book. He even throws in an A & W owner who is the town gossip and flirt along with a small town cop who is a downright nice guy.<br /><br />One of the things I didn't like about THE HOMING  was that I found it depressing. It seemed as if it was disaster after disaster with few positive things happening to any of the characters throughout the entire book. After awhile it begins to wear on you, and I just wanted to finish the book and be done with it.

Search for Love has a very similar plot as that of Island of Flowers also written by Nora Roberts. I'm wondering if in the beginning of her writing career she used the same basic plot outline and tweaked it a bit for a new book? This seems to be the trend with romance novels from a couple of decades ago where the cookie-cutter plots were very evident, and could be a possibility of this one.<br /><br />Search for Love begins with Serenity Smith arriving in a foreign country to meet the grandmother she never knew. She's picked up at the train station by her French cousin, Christophe and driven to meet her grandmother.<br /><br />Christophe doesn't trust Serenity and feels she's only coming to meet her grandmother and renew family ties in order to obtain part of the wealth from the older woman and Christophe feels obligated to protect her. Standard plot, right? Well, there are a few differences...<br /><br />Christophe is technically Serenity's cousin, but it's a relation by marriage not blood - his grandfather married her grandmother. The landscaping of the countryside is magnificently described during this tale. Roberts goes into great detail about the flowing hills, gorgeous flowers, etc.; it's enough for a very vivid mental image. Soon, the beauty fades into accusations - a forged painting and family honor are a few of the reasons Serenity's grandmother disowned her mother and father.<br /><br />Even though Christophe is convinced Serenity is only after money, he's soon shown the true heart of Serenity with her quick flare of temper at the accusations against her parents. When her grandmother accuses Serenity's parents of stealing a very valuable painting and leaving a forgery behind in its place, Serenity is quick to come to their defense and plans on leaving the chateau immediately if her grandmother cannot refrain from such behavior. This flare of temper isn't as strong as what we've seen in more recent characters created by Roberts, but there is a peek of the strong female personalities that evolved later on in her career.<br /><br />The standard \\"opposing sides fall hopelessly in love\\" and the happy-ever-after ending are very predictable but it shouldn't deter you from reading this book. It's not a story that will tax your brain and can be read quickly. I'd recommend it if you need a short break, and want vivid images of the French countryside, a gorgeous chateau, a handsome characters, etc. It's a nice way to spend a few hours of \\"down time\\" and will let you catch your breath before you go back to the rat race of life.k of the strong female personalities that evolved later on in her career. <br /> <br />The standard \\"opposing sides fall hopelessly in love\\" and the happy-ever-after ending are very predictable but it shouldn't deter you from reading this book.

In one word, it's Outstanding in that it not only gives the devoted readers of this series more insight into Kinsey Millhone's past, but it also has a great mystery to go along with that insight.<br /><br />Kinsey comes home from working out at the gym to find two Los Angeles detectives on her porch. As they're talking with her, she learns that her first ex-husband (remember she's twice divorced), Mickey MacGruder, has been shot, is in a coma, and the outlook isn't good. Kinsey is shocked by those events, but when the detectives inform her that her handgun (the one Mickey gave her as a wedding present years ago) was the weapon used to shoot him, she was completely baffled.<br /><br />Those of us who have been with this series since A is for Alibi knew that Kinsey is too curious about anything and everything to not jump in her Volkswagen Beatle Bug and drive to Los Angeles to see Mickey for herself. Sure enough, that's what she did. After the visit, she finds out where Mickey lived and picks the lock on the door (around the crime scene tape, of course) to see what she can find out in the apartment that could give her a clue as to who shot him and why. Now this is when it's very interesting - Kinsey remembers how Mickey is paranoid and figures out where he stashes his secrets. Ok, I never even thought about stuffing/hiding things in the light switch box, the curtain rod, etc.<br /><br />The support characters are dynamic from a wanna be congressman, his hoity-toity wife, a handicapped Vietnam vet who went from being a drunk to a wealthy businessman, his two-timing wife, an ex-con bent on revenging his brother's death, to the Honky-Tonk's new owners - the sons of cops with whom Kinsey used to work. At times I laughed at the characters' antics and other times just shook my head in disbelief. But Grafton was definitely consistent with these personalities as they were all very vivid, strong and animated. She gave a new meaning to \\"mental picture\\".<br /><br />The downside to this book, at least in my opinion, is the dates in which the story takes place. I have read each of the books in this series and when Kinsey says she's 39 years old, I always thought she was close to my age. Well it turns out that Kinsey graduated in 1967 - yes, it appears these books have been written in a time period of ten years ago. This may not be a big deal to some, but to me, it threw off my whole line of thinking. These events are not current. This is definitely something I need to get used to.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say Sue Grafton is back on target with O is for Outlaw as it's full of action, adventure, humor and wit. It's packed full of all the things we've come to expect from this fantastic writer! This book should definitely be added onto your reading list!.

It wasn't her typical romantic story, but instead dealt with more mystery and intrigue. Little did I know that she would eventually expand on her writing abilities in this area and focus the majority of her new material in the mystery genre.<br /><br />Public Secrets deals with the life of Emma, a woman with a past containing one of the worst nightmares known to man. Emma's father, Brian McAvoy, is a famous musician who swept into her life at an early age. Emma's mother had gotten pregnant in an attempt to \\"catch\\" Brian so she could have the luxury and money that went with his fame. Things didn't work out that way because Brian saw her for what she was - a drug addicted manipulator who hated everyone around her. After Emma was born, her mother used her to get money from Brian but squandered it on drugs, clothes, and other addictions in her life. On a visit, Brian couldn't stand the look in his tiny daughter's eyes any longer and took her away from the rancid apartment, hateful mother, and life of hell that she had been enduring. He then showed her what life could be like. Emma felt like she was on top of the world - she had her father, her new mom, a wonderful home, and the best part was she would soon have a new baby brother.<br /><br />Several months later, her new, safe world came crashing down around her when a kidnapping attempt went awry and the baby was killed. Typical with this type of story plot, mimicking real life, this event tears the family apart and each character retreats into his/her own world for a time being. The catalyst that brings them back together is when years later Emma begins to remember that fateful night and realizes that she saw the man who killed her brother. When word of this gets out, Emma's life is in danger. The killer wants to make sure his identity is never made public.<br /><br />When I was reading this book, for some reason I kept picturing McAvoy's band as The Beatles. Silly, I know, but for some reason that was the mental image I had conjured. Maybe it was the wild parties that were described in detail, the bits and pieces shown of the music world including recording sessions and tours, or the English countryside. Without being able to pinpoint the exact reason, I just finally went with the mental image and enjoyed the book, while periodically reminding myself that it WASN'T about The Beatles!<br /><br />The plot is fairly intricate with a few minor twists and turns. Figuring out the villain's identity was not difficult, but the various subplots were very enjoyable and unexpected. True to her style, Nora Roberts is vivid in her detail and descriptions including her characters. One of my favorite parts is when she describes the English farm where Brian McAvoy grew up and where he buried his son in the family graveyard. The detail was such that this countryside was something I craved to see firsthand.<br /><br />Public Secrets isn't one of Nora Roberts' best books, but it is very good.turing McAvoy's band as The Beatles.

Figuring out the villain's identity was not difficult, but the various subplots were very enjoyable and unexpected. True to her style, Nora Roberts is vivid in her detail and descriptions including her characters. One of my favorite parts is when she describes the English farm where Brian McAvoy grew up and where he buried his son in the family graveyard. The detail was such that this countryside was something I craved to see firsthand. <br /> <br />Public Secrets isn't one of Nora Roberts' best books, but it is very good.  <br />	2005-04-05

I picked up this Dinah McCall book because the cover looked intriguing and found it to be just that.  I'm not usually that lucky when grabbing a new author off of the bookstore shelves.<br /><br />This is the story of Laurel Scanlon who has the gift of sight.  This ability was passed down to the oldest daughter in each generation.  Laurel's mother was driven crazy by it and this gift has left Laurel uneasy.  The man in her life had left because he couldn't accept her \\"difference\\".  So now she doesn't trust anyone.  And her heart is given to a man who has been in her dreams for four months, she figures it's safer that way.<br /><br />When her maternal grandmother leaves her Mimosa Grove, a beautiful but run down home outside Bayou Jean, Louisiana, she moves there deciding that a new beginning is just what she needs.  She tries to keep to herself, but that's nearly impossible.  The townsfolk are thrilled that another \\"sighted one\\" has arrived and many come bearing tales of how her grandmother had helped them which puts her at ease a bit.<br /><br />When a child is lost, Laurel uses her gift to help the rescuers find her.  She figures everyone will now shun her, but just the opposite happens.  The child's uncle, Justin Bouvier, comes to Mimosa Grove to personally thank Laurel for her help.  Laurel is shocked, as this is the man who comes to her in her dreams.<br /><br />The tale continues with Justin trying to remove the wall Laurel has built around her heart, while trying to protect her from the dangers lurking at Mimosa Grove.<br /><br />This is a typical romantic mystery but what has it surpass many others on the market is McCall's vivid imagery and wonderful character development.  Her characters range from the beautiful, haunted, Laurel; to ruggedly handsome, Justin; to a variety of unique townsfolk; and Marie, an aging housekeeper who is more of a nanny than maid.  My favorite scenes are when Tule and Marie get together - they are hilarious!  You'll laugh at the antics of some of these characters, which is part of the fun in reading Mimosa Grove.<br /><br />MIMOSA GROVE is a bit predictable, but so enjoyable that you'll easily overlook the minor flaws.  This story definitely put this author on my MUST READ list with this name and her pseudonym of Sharon Sala.laugh at the antics of some of these characters, which is part of the fun in reading Mimosa Grove. <br /> <br />MIMOSA GROVE is a bit predictable, but so enjoyable that you'll easily overlook the minor flaws.

SEE HOW SHE DIES (which is a rewrite of TREASURES, an earlier published story) was enjoyable, but not at the top of my A list.<br /><br />The beginning starts out with a bang.  We're introduced to Katherine (Kat) Danvers right before she's murdered.  Wow, that sure grabbed my attention!  Then Jackson backtracks a bit and introduces us to the Danvers family, each colorful in his/her own right.  This becomes a bit confusing as she switches back and forth between the present, 1970 and 1983.  If you can hang on through the history, it will become easier to understand and more enjoyable.<br /><br />London Danvers, the only child from Witt's second marriage to Kat, was her father's princess, even though she was the youngest of his 5 children.  During Witt's surprise sixtieth birthday party, London's nanny, Ginny Slade, disappears with London.  Even with a million dollar reward, she is not heard from again.<br /><br />Well that is until after Witt and Katherine's deaths... seems Witt put a clause in his will giving the long lost London the majority of his vast estate, to be held should she reappear.  You can imagine the lengths to which the rest of the Danvers Clan will go to keep the wealth among themselves.<br /><br />Along comes Adria Nash, who was told by her dying adoptive father that she was London.  She is in Portland, Oregon to find the truth and see if she really is the long lost heiress.  She meets Zachary Danvers, Witt's middle son, who has always been a rebel.  He takes one look at Adria (who is the spitting image of her mother), and old memories surface.<br /><br />The romantic fireworks between Adria and Zach are a bit strange since they suspect they are brother and half-sister.  Even that knowledge doesn't stop them.  Zach becomes Adria's protector, as the person behind Kat's death, begins to terrorize her.  This only gives him more alone time with her and you can see where this goes.<br /><br />I do have to say that the romance portion of the book was uncomfortable.  Incest was mentioned and both Adria and Zach didn't seem to let that stop them.  And the ending was contrite as if the author had to do something to make this affair OK.  It was very predictable.<br /><br />Also going against Lisa Jackson was her overuse of a couple of phrases.  \\"Diaphragm slamming into lungs\\" was one that was used repeatedly.  \\"Hips on desks\\" and \\"sitting on his lower back\\" were others.  Used once or twice would be enough, but these were used too much!<br /><br />And my final complaint:  Jackson needs a new editor!  There were so many typos and glaring errors it took away from the story line.  I was surprised since this was a rewrite.  I would hope this editor was fired after the book was published - it read like an unedited advanced reader's copy!<br /><br />See How She Dies is predictable - the villain is not a mystery at all, Nelson Danver's \\"secret\\" is obvious, and the rest of the intrigue is lacking.  If you read it only as a piece of fiction, you won't be disappointed, but if you want a good mystery, this isn't the book for you.er and you can see where this goes.  <br /> <br />I do have to say that the romance portion of the book was uncomfortable.

I started reading this author when I lived in Arizona and while visiting a local library found out that he lived only a few miles from me. Hey, I figured I needed to see if my neighbor was indeed a great writer and have only been disappointed in very few of his books. Inca Gold, so far, is definitely my favorite of his books.<br /><br />Cussler's hero, Dirk Pitt, is once again chasing the bad guys with his best friend Al Giordino. This chase takes us through the Amazon jungles and through parts of Mexico without letting the reader stop to catch his breath. It starts out with an anthropological exploration at a water hole in the Andes and when the group finds themselves in trouble, Dirk and Al are sent to the rescue (amazing how the two of them can get involved in trouble just by trying to be nice guys!). The rescue throws them into the middle of an international smuggling ring in search of the golden chain of Huascar (an Inca treasure hidden for years - is it really myth or fact, Cussler won't let on).<br /><br />Just when you think you've helped Dirk and Al out of a jamb, Cussler throws the next bit of action at them. I don't think he left anything out of this book, as it included an earthquake, a tsunami, the rescue at the beginning that I mentioned, hand-to-hand fighting, and a fantastic raft trip down an underground river filled with rapids. The underground river trip was one of my favorite parts and I re-read that portion a couple of times just because it was so intense and vivid!<br /><br />Cussler always throws a bit of historical fact into his books along with his fictional accounts to make a most interesting combination. One thing that I don't like is the endless details he feels are necessary to his story. Now if they were pertaining to an exciting event instead of background I would feel differently but the facts are not exclusive to either. Another Cussler trademark in his stories is to include himself in a bit part - like a passing-through-town type person. You never know when the author will show up in the story and it's kinda fun to figure it out (but it's so sporadic that it's almost impossible to predict!).<br /><br />This was one of my favorite Clive Cussler novels and I wish his later books were this much fun to read!ries is to include himself in a bit part - like a passing-through-town type person.

I think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms, as we've seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred, Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996. Unlike the other two, True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres. To me, it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours.<br /><br />Kelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother, Naomi Chadwick, had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she'd come visit her, she was an emotional wreck. It seems the real reason her mother wasn't a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover. Talk about shock value! Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life.<br /><br />Naomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life. Sounds like a typical plot line, right? Well, sort of, but if Nora Roberts is writing it, you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way. Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder.<br /><br />Can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelsey's broken heart? Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years?  Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again? I won't give away any of the plot, you'll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself!<br /><br />I do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure there's a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting. Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother-daughter relationship. But what I enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch, the surrounding areas, actual workings of the ranch, etc. Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book. The lush green landscape, the openness of the working ranch, the racetrack - ah, it sounded like pure heaven.<br /><br />The plot is very predictable: everyone lives happily-ever-after, mother and daughter are reunited, true love waits for Kelsey, etc., etc. What makes the story enjoyable is the mix that Roberts has perfected - not just pure romance, but a little mystery and intrigue also.nding areas, actual workings of the ranch, etc. Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book.

US	51874804	R35MA7BOLTNLVT	0515114006	706341106	Private Scandals	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Private Scandals made Public	Private Scandals is an interesting diversion from Nora Roberts' normal plots of either mystery or pure romance. The result of this variation is a romantic suspense novel and is a nice change of pace for Roberts' devoted fans.<br /><br />Deanna Reynolds grew up in Kansas and knew she always wanted to be on television. After graduating college, she moves to Chicago and is mentored by Angela Perkins, a popular talk-show host. When Angela is offered a promotion and goes to New York, she offers Deanna a chance to come with her. Deanna has ideas for her own career and turns the offer down. It proves to be a wise move when she becomes the new talk-show host in Chicago. Deanna soars in popularity and soon Angela feels threatened by the quick ratings increase. Even with Deanna's success, she never forgets her basic ideals and beliefs; thus proving to have her feet squarely planted on the ground. It doesn't help alleviate the tension when Dee begins dating Finn Riley, a foreign correspondent who once had romantic links to Angela. So begins the twisted plot and subplots, which include Angela plotting against Dee, Dee and Finn's romantic escapades, and a \\"secret admirer\\" who begins stalking Dee, and killing people who have hurt her in any way.<br /><br />The identity of the stalker/murderer is extremely obvious even to the most novice mystery readers. This could have made Private Scandals a real let down. Instead through the use of a strong male character (who reminded me of a certain real-life reporter hunk from the Desert Storm era) and a look at what really happens in the world of television, the book is very interesting even if not mysterious.<br /><br />This isn't one of Nora Roberts' best books, but it does have its moments. A great moment was when Finn walks away from a plane crash and grabs a microphone to report on the crash itself. Or how about the scene when Dee walks into the studio to find Angela in her chair, bound and gagged...(well, I can't give that scene away, or it may ruin the book for you) - just realize that it was a pleasurable experience reading this book!e away, or it may ruin the book for you) - just realize that it was a pleasurable experience reading this book! <br />	2005-04-04

Devil's Claw is another in the Joanna Brady series written by J.A. Jance and was released to little publicity. I'm not sure why the advertising was limited because it's a great addition to her on-going saga.<br /><br />We're once again taken to Bisbee, Arizona and given a peek into the life of Joanna Brady, the only Arizona female sheriff. In the first book in this series, Desert Heat, Joanna's husband, a sheriff officer, had been killed in the line of duty, which left her alone to raise their young daughter, Jenny. Joanna was then elected Sheriff of Cochise County. It's much more involved than that, and I strongly urge you to read it - it's filled with wonderful descriptions, character depictions and a few plot twists that leave you holding on to your chair! In this book, we find Joanna preparing for her upcoming wedding to Butch. Not only is Joanna trying to get ready for the nuptials, she's having to deal with her over-bearing mother who wants more of a grand ceremony than Joanna desires. Along with those quandaries, is a murder case dumped into Joanna's lap that needs to be solved before she leaves on her honeymoon.<br /><br />An ex-con is killed when returning to her mother's home near Cochise Stronghold (on the reservation near the mountains outside of Bisbee) and her young daughter, Lucinda, witnesses the crime. Lucinda runs away believing her life is in danger leaving her grandmother and the officials wondering if she is a suspect or an innocent bystander. Sound typical? It's not when you throw in the fact that Lucinda has a red-tailed hawk as a pet, and runs away on the Indian Reservation that she's called home for the past 7 years.<br /><br />Typical of Jance's style, there are a few subplots thrown into the mix. Clayton Rhoades, Joanna's elderly neighbor that she pays to help feed her animals, dies and his obnoxious, egotistical daughter shows up blaming Joanna for killing her father by working him to death. We also have a small story about Kristen, Joanna's secretary, and her latest boyfriend, who happens to be part of Joanna's K-9 team.<br /><br />The main plot is well developed, and the usual cast of characters we've come to expect don't let us down with their antics and interactions. It's a very good story but I found it less than the fantastic event I've come to expect from a new Joanna Brady book. If I had to describe it in one word, that word would be anti-climatic.<br /><br />So much more could have been done with these story lines. For example, the final interaction between Joanna Brady and Clayton Rhoades daughter left me wondering what I missed - it was as if Jance was rushed and just ended it. It could have been so much more...<br /><br />The wedding had little details and was written almost as an afterthought - in fact, it was written as the epilog. Huh??? Many of the wedding details had been minimal, including a bridal shower in which several of the characters from previous books make appearances. The wedding and honeymoon were glossed over.<br /><br />After I finished reading the book, I let my mind wander and thought about \\"what could have been\\" with the ending. Rather than write the wedding as an epilog, it could have been a fantastic way to catch the reader up on what has been going on with the characters to which we've grown attached. A perfect example of this would be Angie Kellogg - ok, she was the maid of honor, but what's been going on with her and her English boyfriend who is the parrot man? Nothing else was said except she was the maid of honor. Gee, where's the details for which Jance is famous?<br /><br />One of the big negatives I found in this book was the lack of editing. There were many typographical errors and I recommend that Ms. Jance fire her current editor so her next book can flow. Her devoted readers deserve better than the glaring mistakes that should have been found and omitted before publication.<br /><br />This is one of the few books in which J.A. Jance left loose ends. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the book tremendously and would highly recommend it. It just wasn't up to the level I've come to expect from Jance!eft loose ends.

I have to say that out of all of the Dick Francis books that I've read this one really made an impact on me. I enjoyed the plot so much in Break In, which featured Kit Fielding, that I immediately picked up a copy of this book which once again had him as the main character.<br /><br />Kit Fielding is a steeplechase jockey, who's a little too tall and a little too old to continue racing, but he has his own agenda. Kit's friend, Princess Cassilia, has always been there for him and she's very much involved with the racing world as an owner of a very large horse farm. When she's threatened and her racehorses begin turning up dead, Kit takes it on himself to investigate, even with her personal life in turmoil. As he investigates, it seems as if everyone in the wealthy class of racing is a suspect and this puts Kit in danger himself.<br /><br />Stretching the boundaries of his writing style, Francis has written a great \\"who dun it\\" and created a variety of possible villains along the way. There is the unknown enemy who is determined to ruin Kit's family, a rival in the romantic arena, a weapons dealer who is the King of the underworld black market, and then the horse murderer who uses a bolt to kill horses.<br /><br />For those who have little knowledge of horses, a bolt is a weapon that is similar to a gun, but instead of a bullet being fired, it shoots a heavy metal slide (bolt) against the horse's head which immediately kills it. I'm told that this is a humane way to put down horses and usually administered by a veterinarian in extreme cases. Just the thought of such a weapon left chills up and down my spine, and leave it to Francis to use such a weapon in one of his books.<br /><br />Bolt left me feeling uneasy about the method in which these horses were destroyed, but I guess murder of any kind should never be viewed with complacency! The character of Kit Fielding is one with which many can easily identify and the action is non-stop until the last page. There are even a few twists and turns along the way, just so you don't get over confident that you have figured out the murderer's true identity.<br /><br />Bolt is definitely not for the faint of heart, but an excellent mystery with lots of adventure and wonderful descriptions of the English countryside.e are even a few twists and turns along the way, just so you don't get over confident that you have figured out the murderer's true identity.  <br /> <br />Bolt is definitely not for the faint of heart, but an excellent mystery with lots of adventure and wonderful descriptions of the English countryside. <br />	2005-04-04

Skin Deep was the first book I read involving the flamboyant O'Hurley family (my second favorite family created by Nora Roberts - the O'Hurley's place right after the MacGregors). I was so enthralled with this story that I read it in one sitting and enjoyed every minute of it! In fact, I immediately set about trying to find one of the other books with these characters (Without a Trace and The Last Honest Woman are a couple of the other ones).<br /><br />Chantel O'Hurley had once been a member of the O'Hurley Dancing Triplets until she left the family act and started out on her own, much to her father's regret. But Chantel had done well for herself; after all she was a blonde bombshell and used those fantastic looks and her immense talent to get where she wanted to be: The big screen. Chantel O'Hurley was famous and had reached many of the goals she set for herself. Just when she reached the apex, she started being stalked by an obsessive fan and felt as if her life was in danger. Also fearing for her safety, the studios she was contracted with made her hire a private investigator/body guard. (Ok, so you can probably see where this is heading, right?)<br /><br />Quinn Doran enters the picture as that private investigator with a tough guy attitude and enough good looks to make Chantel stop and take notice. What neither of them wanted was the mutual attraction that sparked and continued to grow no matter what they did to stop it.<br /><br />The romantic side of this tale is stronger than the mystery portion, but Nora Roberts douses the reading audience with humor just to round things out a bit. Chantel isn't anyone's dumb blonde and can hold her own in a battle of wits with Quinn, as shown several times during this tale. Chantel's father, Frank, makes a candid appearance just to stir things up a bit and let the reader understand where Chantel gets her spunk. It's a fast paced, fun, well-rounded book that can be enjoyed in an afternoon or weekend if you want to stretch out the enjoyment.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat predictable, but that doesn't deter from the overall book, as there is enough humor and mystery thrown in the mix of things to make up for the predictability. One thing Skin Deep does show is that Nora Roberts can write a melting pot type book - one with a touch of everything so most can enjoy the story. Her characters are well developed and the settings are very descriptive, right down to the dance step that Frank demonstrates to his captive audience.<br /><br />If you haven't been introduced to the O'Hurley family, I strongly suggest that you pick this book up and begin your journey. You won't be sorry you did!tretch out the enjoyment. <br /> <br />The plot is somewhat predictable, but that doesn't deter from the overall book, as there is enough humor and mystery thrown in the mix of things to make up for the predictability.

Outlaw Mountain continues the story of Joanna Brady, sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona. I have to admit that I've read all seven books in this series and it continues to be one of my favorites. The characters are well developed, plots are well thought out, and the books are just plain fun and exciting. Another plus, at least for me, is that the main character of Joanna Brady is not perfect - she's a struggling, working mother who goes through so much that is familiar territory for the rest of us, it makes her character very believable and identifiable.<br /><br />As always in this series, we are once again taken to Bisbee, Arizona in Cochise County. For those that are unfamiliar with the Arizona region, Bisbee is an old mining town that's within driving distance to Tucson. The background and details given on this small town, from the surrounding landscape down to details about the Copper Queen Hotel has made it intriguing to the point that I want to vacation there - I have to see this area first hand! The fact that J.A. Jance can encourage this type of \\"want\\" is testimony to her fantastic ability as a writer.<br /><br />Jance captures the reading audience from the very beginning with the murder of an elderly woman in a gruesome manner. Now don't get me wrong, most murders are gruesome, but the details that Jance uses make it so - the details aren't gory or bloody, but they do leave a lasting impression on the reader. This is a perfect example - before Alice Rogers is killed, she is chased into a grove of Cholla cactus and pushed into them. These cacti have long needles that are very painful when they come into contact with humans, this I know from personal experience - my hand felt like it was on fire for hours. This is the gruesome detail that I mentioned previously.<br /><br />Joanna Brady now must not only find out who killed Alice, but also why this person wanted her to suffer so horribly. This investigation leads us through many interesting developments with new characters and old alike. The subplots are interwoven into the main story line with such precision that at times you don't realize it's not part of the big picture. We see the relationship between Butch and Joanna take on new meaning, we see more into the relationship between Joanna and her mother, we even see more into Dick Voland - a chief deputy working under Joanna.<br /><br />The killer didn't come as a surprise to me (maybe I read far too many mysteries to be fooled anymore), even the illness reeking havoc with Marianne Mulcayea (Joanna's long time friend and local minister) was not an unknown idea to me. Even so, there was never a dull moment while reading Outlaw Mountain. In fact, I haven't found one book in this series that I haven't absolutely loved and I encourage everyone to read them! I do suggest that you begin with Desert Heat, the first in the set and continue in order. It's not mandatory to understand each new book, but it will help you to feel as if you're part of the story and somehow fit in with Joanna Brady and her group of friends and family.<br /><br />Now for the negative - yes, I actually found a negative with this book! It's a first: J.A. Jance actually made a mistake in this one. She referred to Arizona Game and Fish as Arizona Fish and Wildlife. Ok, so it's not a huge mistake, and I am nitpicking, but it is an error. I haven't ever found a blunder in any of her books - either major or insignificant - until now. It was almost like getting two surprises in a box of Cracker Jacks - it didn't change the flavor, I just knew it wasn't right. If this is the only inaccuracy made by Jance in this series, you can see why this type of research combined with incredible plots, strong characters and great development are what makes these books hit the bestseller list every time!like. The subplots are interwoven into the main story line with such precision that at times you don't realize it's not part of the big picture.

She referred to Arizona Game and Fish as Arizona Fish and Wildlife. Ok, so it's not a huge mistake, and I am nitpicking, but it is an error. I haven't ever found a blunder in any of her books - either major or insignificant - until now. It was almost like getting two surprises in a box of Cracker Jacks - it didn't change the flavor, I just knew it wasn't right. If this is the only inaccuracy made by Jance in this series, you can see why this type of research combined with incredible plots, strong characters and great development are what makes these books hit the bestseller list every time!	2005-04-04

Written in 1994, Nothing Lasts Forever takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that will leave you a little dizzy and completely fooled by the ending, which is one of the reasons most critics who have recently criticized Sheldon agree that this is one of his all-time best!<br /><br />Three roommates, who just happen to be young, female doctors, are featured in Nothing Lasts Forever. The various aspects of their lives unfold before us - their hopes, dreams, fears, loves, ambitions, and their mistakes in life. We see what they endured as interns and see the daily rigors of life as a doctor in a large San Francisco hospital. The decisions made on the spur of the moment, only to be later dissected and examined by each of the doctors to verify in their own minds if they made the right decision. It's an interesting concept of young doctors not always being sure of their choices, but having to live with those conclusions. And what happens when faced with a dire situation - do you stick with your moral values and beliefs or do you euthanatize to prevent suffering? And if not you - who would?<br /><br />Not only are we given glimpses at the insights of these three, but also we're allowed to feel like you're part of their lives - a friend or neighbor perhaps. Sheldon builds a relationship not only between the three main characters, but involves the reader in the formula as well. You'll become emotionally engaged while reading about the doctors' everyday lives.<br /><br />The decisions and moral beliefs are all brought out in a courtroom when one of the doctors is accused of killing her patient for monetary purposes. Sounds plausible, but did she commit the crime? And every aspect of each of the three women's lives are brought out and inspected to try and solve the murder. Many surprises await!<br /><br />Nothing Lasts Forever has been dubbed a \\"thriller of suspense\\" and rightly so. It will grab you from the beginning and not let go until you read the very last page. The plot is extremely well engineered and the writing is superb! Sidney Sheldon mixes humor, wit and intrigue with the perfect blend to entice even the most ardent critic.<br /><br />There are so many twists and turns in this high-speed page-turner that I'd warn the reader to hold on tightly. You won't want to put it down, so it should come with a warning that you may miss sleep in order to finish Nothing Lasts Forever. I'd highly recommend it if you're ready for a wild reading journey!dubbed a \\"thriller of suspense\\" and rightly so.

Her series on the MacKade brothers is one of her most fun for the reader and gives you a bit of everything in the plots.<br /><br />The Fall of Shane MacKade is the last in this series and focuses on Shane MacKade, youngest brother to Jared, Rafe and Devin. Shane may be the youngest, but he holds his own in the family battles. Since the other three are happily married, Shane is determined to continue as a single man who enjoys the company of women, all women.<br /><br />When Dr. Rebecca Knight, who has spent her life in the world of academia and collecting degrees, comes to town to visit her old college roommate, Regan MacKade, a series of events are set in motion that will forever change the lives of both Rebecca and Shane. Rebecca is determined to start living life instead of studying it and decides on researching the ghosts that are said to haunt Antitam, Maryland - the site of many civil war battles and home to the MacKades. It's a bit of a detour from Rebecca's normal interests, but something she feels is worth exploring.<br /><br />All of the MacKades had experiences with the ghosts in their area. Having grown up there, they have heard the battles as the ghosts continue their fights on the fields, and all are eager to talk about these to Rebecca. That is all of the brothers except Shane, who denies any experiences with the paranormal activities that surround him and are fluent on the farm. Rebecca is eager to find out not only about the ghosts that haunt him, but why he is in denial about their existence.<br /><br />And since this is a Silhouette Special Edition, romance is the key ingredient in this story. Rebecca falls for Shane. Shane falls for Rebecca. Both are too stubborn to realize it until it's time for Rebecca to head back to New York and Shane must break down and tell her how he really feels - not only about the ghosts but about the thought of losing her.<br /><br />Ok, so the ending is a bit predictable, it's a typical romance, but what is not typical is the interactions of the characters. At one point you have the four brothers rolling around outside of the barn in a free-for-all fight and the spouses in the house watching through the windows placing bets on which brother will win, while readying the ice bags. Ah yes, this has been a very entertaining series.<br /><br />Yes, this is a typical love story, but with the added flashbacks into the past and the orneriness of the MacKade brothers, it's just plain fun. I've read each of the MacKade Brother books (The Return of Rafe MacKade, The Pride of Jared MacKade, The Heart of Devin MacKade and The Fall of Shane MacKade) and found each to be enjoyable and you will chuckle at their antics. If only life could be so simple...sts but about the thought of losing her.  <br /> <br />Ok, so the ending is a bit predictable, it's a typical romance, but what is not typical is the interactions of the characters.

It has everything a mystery should have in it - murder, missing jewels, mayhem... In my opinion, it's going to be difficult for Francis to top this one, but I can't wait while he keeps trying!<br /><br />Straight takes the reader behind the scenes of the jewel trade and it's not an industry that's always on the up and up. Derek Franklin has been on a roller coaster ride of late as his steeplechase jockey career is nearing the end with him sustaining yet another injury. During his forced leave to heal, Derek finds out that his older brother, Greville, has been attacked and is on his deathbed. After his brother succumbs to his injuries, Derek is told that he has inherited his brother's business. Too late to protect himself, Derek realizes that his brother was a target and Derek suspects it has something to do with a fortune in missing diamonds.<br /><br />This isn't a direct \\"who dun it\\" but also has a few subplots that are enjoyable in their own right. When Derek is summoned to his dying brother's hospital bed, the interaction (or lack there of) made me very thankful for the close relationship I have with my brothers and sisters. This thankfulness was reinforced throughout the story, as Derek learns more about his older brother and begins to understand him.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book is when Derek is sure that a clue is hidden in his brother's computer, but he is unable to access the correct password. Greville's secretary comes to the rescue. After hearing the clues left by Greville, followed by a brief mind struggle, she comes up with the correct code word and up pops a message on the computer screen congratulating her and promising her a raise. Now that's the kind of boss I want - he sounds fun!<br /><br />The only negative some may have with this book is that it is a detour for Dick Francis. As most of his books revolve around horseracing, his devoted fans have come to expect that background. In Straight the only reference to horseracing is the fact that Derek is an injured jockey.<br /><br />Want to read a mystery that will have you guessing until the end?

Riley in the Morning was definitely an exception to this standard of Ms. Brown's.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what Sandra Brown was trying to accomplish with this tale - the jumping from present to past tense was an interesting detour; the sexual friction between the main characters could have been handled with much more fireworks; and the story-line was just plain weak and very predictable. Thank goodness most of her books aren't like this!<br /><br />Brin Cassidy is a producer. She met the difficult and egomaniac Jon Riley when she became the producer of his morning television show, Riley in the Morning. Ok so that's where she got the name of the book, but there are few other links to this - it's not about the television show or about producing programs, so what's with the name? Brin is throwing a birthday party for her current boss and Jon Riley shows up right before it begins. Of course, the bartender doesn't show, so Riley volunteers to help out. Oh, and did I mention that Brin and Riley were married and she left him seven months earlier and he's just now coming to ask her why? That's the part I really don't understand - there was no rhyme or reason for this by-play at this given time.<br /><br />Brin isn't sure if Riley is there to try to fix their relationship or to get her to come back as the producer of his television show. And he shows up the night before she's to make a decision on a big promotion that would involve her moving out of the area. Everything that happens between these two bring back a memory or two that is shared with the reader - and in my opinion, a few of those memories were so boring, they could have easily been forgotten and the reader would have been fine!<br /><br />There are a lot of side journeys that seem unnecessary and appear to be page fillers. For example, the trip to the airport to pick up an associate at 4:00 AM is a bit tedious. Well, she does tell Brin that Riley was given an ultimatum in getting her back as producer or he was going to get fired. But if that were the case, why not do this over the telephone instead of having us ride along with the characters to pick up someone at the airport (because she lost her purse). This was just a bit too unrealistic for me.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you're bored and have read all of the really fantastic things on the market then pick up a copy of this book - but don't buy it - go to the local library or borrow it from a friend! It is still better than some books out there, but it sure isn't at the top of my A list. I'd recommend it but only if you're in a pinch, otherwise, pick up a copy of Witness, French Silk or Stand Off by Sandra Brown - you'll be much happier!to pick up an associate at 4:00 AM is a bit tedious.

My sister, Jana, had suggested this author to me so I went to the local library and picked up Born in Fire. Unfortunately, I got very little sleep in the next couple of days because of it. It was impossible to put down! But it was also the beginning of a wonderful journey - I had found a new favorite author and I was and still am determined to read all of the books she's written. Not an easy task when many of these books are out of print and very difficult to find. Luckily for those who have not read Born in Fire, the Born In trilogy is readily available.<br /><br />The story follows Margaret Mary Concannon, a young woman from the small Irish village of County Claire who is a very gifted glass artisan. Maggie's father, Tom, sent her to Venice to study glassblowing. Before she can acclaim international fame, her father dies and she must return. She sets up a studio and continues her craft, much to her mother's chagrin.<br /><br />We're shown that Maggie has continued with her talent because of the love and encouragement given by her father. The family life of the Concannons is dysfunctional at best, as the mother is unhappy and determined to make everyone around her as miserable as she. She had to give up her dreams of becoming a singer when she was a young girl and married Tom Concannon. She continues to blame her daughters for her never being able to fulfill those dreams.<br /><br />When the wealthy owner of an art gallery with international branches visits Maggie, she instantly brushes him off and doesn't want to be bothered. He's planning on opening a gallery in Ireland and wants to focus on local artists. This owner, Rogan, falls in love with Maggie and has to figure out a way to make her fall for him, while convincing her to let his gallery handle her glass sculptures.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the fantastic characters. Maggie is vibrant, full of life, driven by an inner source that the reader ultimately admires, and I personally loved the spit of temper that we periodically saw. Rogan is handsome, reserved and completely floored by Maggie and her Irish boldness. We're given glimpses into the life of Brianna, Maggie's sister, who is Maggie's opposite. She's quiet, reserved and spends her days trying to please the ever sarcastic mother. We are introduced to Murphy Muldoon, the gorgeous hunk of a neighbor that always seems to be there whenever Maggie or Brianna needs help. We often wonder why neither Concannon can see through the shy looks and see the love beneath Muldoon's surface.<br /><br />Being an avid Nora Roberts fan, and having read most of her books, I have to say that Maggie Concannon is one of the strongest characters she's created. I keep hoping that the Born In trilogy will have a follow-up book soon, like Roberts has done with several of her other successful trilogies!<br /><br />Born in Fire is action packed, full of emotion and definitely a book that will hook you until you've finished it. As the beginning of a trilogy, it captures you and ensures the reading of the next book. I'd suggest that you have Born in Ice in your possession so you can jump right into the next tale in the series.

Having recently finished John Grisham's The Testament, I'm wondering if the similarities in plots are a coincidence or if this is a typical characteristic in extremely wealthy families that makes great fodder for mystery writers all over the world.<br /><br />Both The Testament and Morning, Noon and Night focus on the death of the rich patriarch who seem like good guys, but in reality, are both cruel, heartless and self-centered egomaniacs. Although the death in The Testament was a suicide, the death of Harry Stanford in Morning, Noon and Night is either an accident or a murder. Sidney Sheldon leaves it up to the reader to try to figure out. He does give you the answer, which should surprise even the most die-hard armchair crime sleuth, but you have to wait until the very end to get those answers!<br /><br />Both books showcase offspring who have had little to do with their father for most of their lives (except to pop in when they want something, especially large chunks of money). After the deaths of the fathers, the children are all overwrought with emotions and act like grieving, loving children, while wondering how much money they will inherit and plotting how they will spend it. Then you have them trying to cheat their siblings out of their imagined shares. Both Sheldon and Grisham seem to be painting a very ugly picture when this amount of money is involved.<br /><br />Both Morning, Noon and Night and The Testament involve an illegitimate daughter who stands to inherit millions. The big difference is that in The Testament, she's an innocent player, while in Morning, Noon and Night, Julia may be a key factor in her father's death!<br /><br />Unlike most of Sidney Sheldon's books, Morning, Noon and Night focuses on four siblings instead of one main character with a strong, clearly defined individuality. As the journey takes the reader through murder, revenge, blackmail, greed, hate, and miscellaneous other mayhem, it's difficult to put the book down, even for a few minutes.<br /><br />Morning, Noon and Night is definitely a page-turner and you'll find it difficult to spread reading the book over a few days time - you'll want to finish it in one sitting! Sidney Sheldon doesn't let us down with the ending, as it's unexpected and unanticipated.<br /><br />Morning, Noon and Night is one of my favorite novels by Sidney Sheldon.

Creating memorable families and then weaving tales around key members is a trait in which Nora Roberts surpasses other writers.<br /><br />Alexi Stanislaski (Alex, as he' s known to most non-family members) is a New York police detective who has always been able to separate his personal feelings from work - those two aspects of his life have never been allowed to over-lap. He's never let anyone he loves into his work world thus protecting them from the harsh side of humanity. He's currently assigned to a case involving the murder of two prostitutes and his life is status quo - that is until Bess McNee enters it and turns him upside down!<br /><br />Bess is a soap opera writer who believes in researching her subject matter first hand. When she's arrested with a prostitute, Alex doesn't believe her story and puts her in a cell with all the criminals arrested that night. Bess's zest for life and positive outlook captures the gorgeous detective's attention and the rest is inevitable.<br /><br />Having read all of Nora Roberts' recent mysteries (which seem to be her latest genre of choice) and reading the first few pages of this book, I was expecting more mystery and less romance. Convincing Alex was an enjoyable, quick read that left little up to the imagination, but was non-the-less kinda fun. I sat back and enjoyed without trying to solve the murders for Alex, which is what I usually do with mysteries.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book to stimulate your brain, then this isn't it. If you're looking for a fun, non-cerebral way to spend a few hours, then this is the book for you!<br /><br />What's even better than a few enjoyable, relaxing hours spent reading Convincing Alex is that the reader gets another peek into the life of one of the Stanislaskis - \\"those wild Ukrainians\\" as Nora Roberts has dubbed them.

Another of Nora Roberts' early romance tales involves the characters of Victoria Ashton, affectionately known as Tory and Phil Kincaid. Tory is acting sheriff in Friendly, New Mexico, a small town that hasn't changed in years. Phil Kincaid is a big time movie director from Hollywood trying to find the perfect town to use as a backdrop for his next film. When he flies into town, he's stopped for speeding and then arrested when he refuses to sign the ticket. The typical romance plot takes over from there.<br /><br />The characters in this saga are not typical romance characters!<br /><br />Tory Ashton is only filling in as sheriff until the next election a few months down the line. It seems her father was the sheriff and died unexpectedly and she felt responsible to take over until the elections. Tory is actually an attorney from Albuquerque and also acts as judge for the small town of Friendly.<br /><br />Phil Kincaid seems like the typical director type - always wanting to be in charge and has difficulty taking orders from someone else in authority. A bit on the spoiled side, and used to getting his way, as he is depicted when he refuses to sign the speeding ticket.<br /><br />Merle T. is the deputy in Friendly and this character is fantastic. Merle T. should have been born in the 1800's and longs for gunfights, barroom brawls, etc. He even walks with a swagger! Merle T. is innocent, naïve and since he and Tory grew up together, she's always been the one to look out for him.<br /><br />Tod is a local teenager who gets into trouble with a storeowner by hanging out with twins a few years older who always seem to be in trouble. Tod is caught by Tory and sentenced to community service when she senses Tod comes from an abusive home.<br /><br />And Roberts throws in appearances from a wide variety of townspeople who are colorful enough to make the reader chuckle and wonder if a visit to Friendly, New Mexico wouldn't be a great vacation spot!<br /><br />A few of the subplots seemed to be lacking. For instance, Phil convinces Tory to let him film her while riding her Palomino. You expect something else to happen with that \\"home movie\\", like showing up in the film or something. But it's just left dangling.<br /><br />Another subplot that didn't go anywhere involved the twins that were always in trouble. I thought that something would culminate when the movie was being filmed but nothing happened with them either.<br /><br />Other than these minor complaints, The Law is a Lady is a good book.

After reading The Devil in Spurs, I can say that I will definitely be finding out!<br /><br />I have to admit that I picked up this book for a quarter at a local yard sale because the title struck a funny bone. Ok, so maybe that's not the best reason to pick up a book, but I figured for a quarter, I couldn't go wrong! I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Devil in Spurs is a western and has a somewhat typical plot for a western romance (cowboy romance). The characters are strong, well developed and most are interesting in their own right. Others are downright despicable which is exactly the emotion for which Hess was striving.<br /><br />Jonty Rand is a woman disguised as a boy (something that she's had to do all her life to not be noticed by cowboys who visit the \\"bawdy house\\" in which she is raised.

He figures Jonty is a skinny teenaged boy who needs to be toughened up and doesn't let up on him at all during the wagon trip.<br /><br />Jonty's secret is out when she's attacked by a mountain lion and her shirt it torn open.

I wondered about LaTour the owner of a saloon, and who's relationship with Jonty gives Cord many sleepless nights and many days filled with jealousy. I found myself laughing at the antics of Tillie, the retired prostitute turned cook who keeps LaTour in line. I found myself grimacing whenever Paunch would enter the plot again - he was such a disgusting character that each time his name was mentioned my skin would crawl. Then there was Johnny the Indian who is always there to protect Jonty.<br /><br />Even with the typical plot and outcome, there were a few surprises along the way, which kept my attention.

And so the real story begins...<br /><br />Returning to Charleston, Hammond discovers the local business tycoon, Lute Pettijohn, has been murdered. This is the same person Hammond has been investigating on corruption charges. The plot thickens when we find out that Hammond had recently discovered his father's involvement in a land deal with Pettijohn and if Hammond were to continue with the corruption investigation, charges would also have to be filed against his father. Does Hammond have enough conviction to indict his own father?<br /><br />That would be enough to get the story going, but the reader soon learns that the mystery woman (Dr. Alex Ladd) with whom Hammond had the night of forbidden passion is now a prime suspect in the murder. Hammond Cross is her alibi, and she his, but the costs of publicly admitting that could cost him his future as the District Attorney.<br /><br />The support characters in this tale are equally colorful. Davee Pettijohn, Lute's widow, is anything but grieving and actually throws a wild party the day after the funeral. Oh, and did I mention that Davee and Hammond are childhood friends? Tongues are wagging in Charleston...<br /><br />Rory Smilow is the investigating detective on the case, and had been accused of tampering with evidence in a prior case. Smilow is rigid, unbending, conceited, and smug. When the detective seems determined to pin the murder on Alex Ladd, could that determination result from him covering his own tracks? Seems his sister was Lute Pettijohn's first wife and the relationship between Pettijohn and Smilow is anything but amicable.<br /><br />Steffi Mundell wants to be the next District Attorney and will stop at nothing to achieve that position. She's determined to solve this case herself, and sullying Hammond's reputation in the process is only an added benefit. She and Rory Smilow form a strange partnership, but their goal seems to be the same - high profile publicity in a high profile murder case...<br /><br />The ending couldn't have been done any other way. Yes it was predictable at the very end, but we're left wondering if Hammond Cross's future is as bright as once thought - if good prevails evil - if doing the right thing doesn't hurt your future, etc. When the real killer is revealed, the reader understands the extent some people will go in life.<br /><br />While my favorite Sandra Brown book is still The Witness, this is a good alternative. The Alibi is definitely worth the price! This is a great way to spend a cold, rainy weekend!hildhood friends?

I've read most of the books written by Mary Higgins Clark and have enjoyed them. Before I Say Goodbye is her 22nd book and my least favorite of all of them. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I just felt her other novels were much more exciting and interesting.<br /><br />I read the back cover of the book and expected something completely different than the story before me. The synopsis indicated that Nell MacDermott had lost her husband, Adam, when a bomb blew up his boat. She had so many unanswered questions. When a woman approached her with psychic powers claiming to have contacted Adam in the after-life, Nell agrees to try to get the answers through this medium.<br /><br />This wasn't the story line at all - there was a hint at the paranormal and psychic abilities, but only a hint. Maybe Clark's publicist was trying to draw in those interested in the paranormal. The story was based more on Nell trying to clear Adam's name when bid rigging and construction scams are investigated by law enforcement agencies and her husband's name seems to be at the center of it all. Oh and did I mention that Nell's grandfather (who raised her) is a retired congressman who wants his granddaughter to follow in his political footsteps? With the black cloud hanging over her dead husband, Nell's political future is very uncertain. Nell goes on her own sleuthing expedition to try to get answers and ends up getting more than she bargained for and it's a race against the clock to save her.<br /><br />The characters are not very well described, but only vaguely outlined. That's probably the biggest detriment to the book - there were so many support characters that could have made for some fantastic subplots and the opportunities were wasted. For example, Nell's Great Aunt Gert could have an entire book devoted to her whimsical character. She's fun, eclectic and loves to explore the supernatural (didn't Mary Higgins Clark write an entire book for another support character with the same fun characteristics? Yep, remember The Lottery Winner?). Maybe the future will hold a book on Great Aunt Gert, which should be fun to read.<br /><br />Before I Say Goodbye is an average book, but definitely not on the top of Mary Higgins Clark's list of great books. Before I Say Goodbye leaves you wanting more - more character description, more in-depth plot, more subplots, more everything! I'd suggest it only if you've read all of her other books, but until then, leave it on the library shelf!e same fun characteristics? Yep, remember The Lottery Winner?).

We've all heard tales or seen identical twins switching identities. I taught a set of identical twins how to swim when they were five years old and saw them switch identities when it was convenient for them. It was frustrating, amusing and at times confusing. Little did I know that this switching of identities would be the basis of a fantastic suspense novel written by one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Identical twins Gillian and Melina Lloyd haven't switched identities since they were children. Now in their late thirties, Melina talks Gillian into switching identities once again. After hearing her biological clock ticking, Gillian decides to be artificially inseminated at an exclusive fertility treatment center, The Waters Clinic. At lunch that day, she tells Melina what she has done and Melina decides Gillian needs a night on the town. She also has the perfect evening planned for her sister. Since Melina hates Gillian's boyfriend, Jem Hennings, she decides that Gillian needs a change and talks her into taking her place as the media escort of a famous, gorgeous and very sexy Native American astronaut, \\"Chief\\" Hart. Hoping that her sister would hit if off with someone other than Hennings, little did Melina know just how well they would get along and what sinister outcome would result from this meeting.<br /><br />When Gillian's mutilated body is discovered in her home the next morning, the story begins to go from a fast paced to a high-speed journey of intrigue and mystery. Melina is devastated by the death of her sister and vows to find answers. All the leads keep coming back to a high profile TV evangelist known as Brother Gabriel, who isn't as saintly as his followers seem to believe. Seems Brother Gabriel has his own ideas for creating a New World Order that involves him populating the world with his own offspring. Since the conventional methods hadn't produced the amount of children he needed for this conspiracy, he turned to modern medicine to help him. Yes, donor sperm at fertility clinics around the world had been substituted with his sperm.<br /><br />It seems as if the reader is never sure just who is an ally to Brother Gabriel and figuring out who his devoted followers are is part of the fun of this book. But that's not the only ambiguity that has to be resolved. Sandra Brown is an expert at weaving numerous subplots (each equally exciting) into the main story line, which is one of the reasons her books in the mystery genre are excellent.<br /><br />The ending is a bit obvious and comes as no surprise, but this doesn't deter from the excellence of the story. There are a few minor surprises towards the end that should fool even the most die-hard mystery fan. One professional reviewer referred to this book as having \\"more plot twists than San Francisco's famous Lombard Street\\" and I have to agree! Brown doesn't leave any lose ends and ties everything up neatly before the last page. It seems that she may have left an opening for a future novel involving a couple of FBI agents.<br /><br />Some readers have noted that the book is a little long and the plot suffers for it - I agree it is a bit long, but I disagree that the plot suffers because of it. These few additional pages can easily be overlooked in the grand scheme of things. In fact, I feel The Switch far exceeds Brown's prior release The Alibi and having enjoyed this book so much, I can't wait for the next bestseller by her.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fast-paced thrill that's not on a straight path but instead is filled with bumps and curves, this is definitely a book to add to your \\"Must Read\\" list.

After much soul searching I have decided that I love this author!  Must be why I pick up a copy of her books as soon as they hit the market.<br /><br />This is a story about a doctor (Claire) and her son (Noah) who move to a small town in Maine as they try to rebuild their lives after the death of Claire's husband and Noah's father. Claire is the outsider trying to establish her medical practice and sees an outbreak of violence among the juveniles in town. She feels there's a biological reason for the violence and is met with skepticism.  Many of the locals are trying to cover everything up, including the history of a similar outbreak 42 years before. As Claire struggles for answers to these questions, she also struggles with rebuilding a relationship with her son.<br /><br />This story has a little bit of everything -- romance, intrigue, mystery and medical thriller subjects. Gerritsen shows a tremendous amount of skill in pulling most of the sub-plots together in a way that doesn't leave the reader wondering why they are on a bumpy road type of book. There are a few loose ends that she doesn't tie up that does leave the reader wondering who and why.<br /><br />Bloodstream is definitely a smooth ride and a very enjoyable book. I agree that this is definitely an author to add to your reading list!	2005-03-31

Coming from an educational environment, this submission into a branch of the construction industry was definitely a change for me.<br /><br />One of the most useful things I learned during this time was about Sunset's Western Sunset Garden Book. This firm designed the landscape for large resorts, high-end custom homes and a wide variety of commercial complexes. The landscape designers always used Western Sunset Garden Book for any and all questions regarding plant material they were using on a project. Unless this book was consulted on a specific plant, it wasn't included in the plans!<br /><br />Western Sunset Garden Book lists any and all useful information on over 10,000 species of plants. This information includes growing traits, the likes and dislikes of the plant (e.g. likes full sun, is drought tolerant, etc.), the size of the plant(s) at maturity, and just about anything else you can think of needing to know.<br /><br />The information is also broken down by climate zone, so you can see what plants will thrive in your area and which won't last long. This alone can save you a lot of money when selecting your plant material. I picked up a copy of this \\"Landscape Bible\\" as many in our office referred to it, when about half of the plant material in my yard didn't survive the first freeze. Yes those Hibiscus and Bougainvillea looked great and were really growing well until the temperature dropped. Have you ever seen a black Hibiscus or Bougainvillea plant? It's not a pretty sight!<br /><br />I'd suggest this book for any gardening enthusiast or even for the homeowner that wants to change a few planting beds. It's not the type of book that you'd read cover to cover, but if you use it as a reference book, it could save you from making a costly mistake!	2005-03-31

Still Waters is the first book by Hoag that I've read, so I can't compare her work to other novels by her. It was good enough that I'll try another of her mystery books.<br /><br />Elizabeth Stuart is a twice divorced, gorgeous, sexy, mother of one who moves to Still Waters, Minnesota in the hopes of starting her life over. Dane Jantzen is the local small town hero, ex-pro football player who's moved home after going through his own nasty divorce. Dane is now the local sheriff with a tainted view of the townsfolk - he doesn't want to believe any of them could be bad. When Elizabeth has the murdered body of a local land developer literally fall at her feet, she and Dane are thrown together. Dane wants to believe the killer is an out-of-town drifter but Elizabeth isn't so sure. The two very dynamic personalities clash often during the solving of this crime, which also brings forth a few romantic sparks.<br /><br />The overall story is well thought out and accomplishes covering the basic elements in a good mystery. What it doesn't do is fool anyone. The villain is very predictable and the plot leaves nothing for the reader's imagination except when the villain will strike again.<br /><br />Another problem is a few minor errors/conflicts written towards the end of the book. One example would be Dane getting into a verbal confrontation with Boyd (one of his deputies) and fires him. A few pages later, Boyd is worried about doing something wrong and losing his job.<br /><br />Tami Hoag does a fairly good job tying up all of the loose ends, but in doing so, seems to skim over issues that should have more detail. I can't really give any examples without giving the ending away, but suffice it to say that instead of alluding to characters and instead making them a focus on the book, the ending is a sure thing.<br /><br />With the fame associated with the name \\"Tami Hoag\\" I was expecting more with Still Waters and was left a little disappointed with the book. It is still better than a lot that's out there, and was a decent way to spend a few days. It doesn't stand up to works by Patricia Cornwell or Iris Johansen (no matter what the back of the book says!). I'd recommend buying this book, but only at a discounted price.with the name \\"Tami Hoag\\" I was expecting more with Still Waters and was left a little disappointed with the book.

I picked up a copy of The Testament at a local library book sale for a twenty-five cents and thought about reading it. As I was driving home, I decided that if The Testament was similar to the last two, I would cross John Grisham off my list of favorite authors. I wasn't sure if his writing style had changed, or if it was just me changing what I want in a book; but either way, I didn't want to struggle through any more boring books. I guess you could say this was Grisham's last chance to keep me as an avid fan.<br /><br />I'm very thankful that I decided to give Grisham one more chance! In my opinion, this book is right up there with his all time greats, The Pelican Brief, Street Lawyer, etc.<br /><br />From the beginning the story of Troy Phelan grabs you and won't let go. Troy is a billionaire who is tired - tired of his family fighting among each other, tired of running his many companies, but most of all, tired of living. Troy plans to have all of his children from three previous marriages in his corporate headquarters for the signing of his last will and testament. Since his children believe he has a brain tumor and will soon be dividing up $ 11 billion, they are eager to attend. Each ex-wife and her children are seated in a different conference room separate from the other family members. Troy, his attorney, and three psychiatrists are in a conference room and video cameras transmit the proceedings. The psychiatrists are there to verify that Troy is of sound mind and therefore the last testament will stand up under any scrutiny. After the meeting breaks up, with cameras still rolling, Troy surprises everyone by producing a different will and testament, signs it and then leaps out the window to his death.<br /><br />As if this mess isn't enough fodder for the entire book, Grisham adds another dimension to the story. It seems that Troy has left the majority of his estate to an illegitimate daughter, Rachel Lane, a missionary in the Pantanal of Brazil. Nate O'Riley, a burned out attorney just out of rehab, is assigned by the firm handling Troy's estate to find Rachel. And so begins a journey that takes the reader through the wilderness of unspoiled Brazilian jungles. We're treated to glimpses of how life is lived in the jungles of Brazil, which brings the reader to wonder, if only for a moment, about our society and lifestyles. Grisham compares the Phelans who are all spoiled, greedy and corrupt to Rachel Lane, who's entire goal in life is to help the Indian tribe she's lived with for several years without what many would consider the necessities of life. It's definitely the old \\"good versus evil\\" plot but made enjoyable with various twists.<br /><br />Grisham has great character development and shows a knack for mixing intrigue with self-study. It does have its predictable aspects, but has enough mystery thrown in to keep the reader amused and entertained. With this book, we not only wonder if we are living life to its fullest, but also wonder about our ideals.legitimate daughter, Rachel Lane, a missionary in the Pantanal of Brazil.

My first introduction to Tess Gerritsen was reading Bloodstream and I thoroughly enjoyed that story. My friend, the one responsible for getting me hooked on Gerritsen told me that Harvest and Life Support were even better than Bloodstream. I wondered if it could be possible and decided to see. The result: I only thought I was hooked on this author before, but after reading both of these other books, I'm definitely an avid fan!<br /><br />Life Support focuses on Dr. Toby Harper, an emergency room doctor who works the night shift at Springer Hospital so she can take care of her elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimer's. Toby's normal, structured life is turned upside down when an elderly patient suffering from confusion is brought into her ER and then he suddenly disappears. Of course a surgeon bent on revenge against Toby uses this as a catalyst in an attempt for her dismissal. Her once boring life has suddenly turned into a battle - a fight to keep her job, a fight to continue taking care of her mother after her longtime home healthcare aide resigns, and a fight to figure out what happened to the disappearing patient.<br /><br />Enter Dr. Carl Wallenburg, doctor from Brant Hill, an upscale retirement housing area. The missing patient just happened to live at Brant Hill and this is more than the coincidence Wallenberg wants everyone to believe when a second patient turns up disoriented and showing signs of seizures. When Toby tries to find a connection between Brant Hill and the patients, she begins to uncover a research program using an experimental hormone protocol that is touted as the Fountain of Youth. The only problem is that this procedure has a big drawback - a few of the patients are dying from it.<br /><br />The plot is wonderfully laid out so that it keeps the reader on the edge of the seat throughout most of the book. Just when you relax another twist takes place and you're back on the edge once again. A few of the subplots are predictable, but that seems to be part of the overall design in drawing in the reader to the point where you don't know which subplot will be predictable and which will be a roller coaster ride. It will have you second-guessing yourself from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />Character development is excellent. The physical descriptions are such that you can close your eyes and actually see the character vividly. The interactions bring emotions to the reader - you can feel the friendship between Dr. Toby Harper and Dr. Robbie Brace; you can feel the attraction between Dr. Toby Harper and Dr. Daniel Dvorak; you can feel the animosity between Dr. Carl Wallenburg and Dr. Toby Harper. The imagery used with these characters and scenes are so enticing, I actually felt as if I was Toby Harper.<br /><br />Are there any negatives to the book? Yes, but you have to look very hard and be very picky about it. So in order to appear unbiased towards this author, I'll list a couple of negatives.<br /><br />The sub-story of Molly Pickard is weak. Molly is a sixteen-year-old prostitute who is impregnated with cells that grow into pituitary glands that form a cross between a tumor and a deformed fetus (the formula for the Fountain of Youth). The idea that these scientists would use a prostitute to \\"host\\" their experiment seems far-fetched. Drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, etc., would ruin the \\"gland\\" they are trying to generate. It would seem that tricking a prostitute into being a \\"host\\" and believing that she's pregnant with a baby wouldn't be the best option for their project. (OK, so I told you it was a picky negative).<br /><br />Then the romantic sub-plot of Dr. Dvorak's assistant and the cop seems unnecessary. It's alluded to and then nothing ever happens and it's not relevant to the main story, so why is it in there in the first place? Could it be a page filler? Possibly, but I'm not sure.<br /><br/>If you enjoy medical thrillers and take pleasure in a story that is both spine tingling and horrifying, then this is the next book you should read. You won't be disappointed!ot sure. <br /> <br />If you enjoy medical thrillers and take pleasure in a story that is both spine tingling and horrifying, then this is the next book you should read.

A friend of mine, told me about this great author, Tess Gerritsen, and I read one book she wrote, Bloodstream. Even though I enjoyed it, it wasn't the type of book that inspired me to immediately pick up another by this author, but it was still well written.<br /><br />Several months later, I picked up Harvest and proceeded to read it. I will admit to stopping twice in the beginning after only a few pages because it seemed very depressing. The beginning deals with patients dying and the donation of their organs. I wasn't in a mindset to deal with this type of story line, so I put it off for a couple of weeks. Once I started reading again, I was enthralled and couldn't put the book down. In fact, I finished Harvest late one night (even though I had to get up early to go to work. I refused to put the book down until the last page had been read).<br /><br />Abby DiMatteo is a doctor working on her residency in a prestigious Boston hospital. During her emergency medicine rotation, she's thrown into an organ transplant nightmare - her brain dead patient's heart is needed by two patients and the administration decides to \\"give\\" the heart to the wealthy candidate instead of a teenage boy who is higher on the transplant list. Through a series of end runs around hospital administration, DiMatteo becomes an accomplice to the attending physician and they transfer the boy to a different hospital, and convince the family of the dying patient to sign a direct donation form. The heart is transferred and the lifesaving surgery performed. Miraculously, the wealthy patient also receives a heart that night. This series of events begins Abby's nightmare.<br /><br />It seems that Abby has made an enemy of the wealthy patient's husband and he is bent on ruining her both professionally and personally. As Abby is put on administrative leave, she and her fianc&eacute; grow farther apart. She's not sure if it's because he is still a part of the hospital staff, and more importantly, he's still a part of the transplant team.<br /><br />The reader is treated to a look at the \\"other side\\" - the business end of transplant harvests and an \\"it could happen\\" scenario. A group of Russian Mafia members have created a lucrative business procuring human organs and selling them (a black market in human organs). It doesn't seem to matter that they kill the patient in order to obtain the organ, because no one seems to ask or care. No one except Abby DiMatteo. When things don't make sense and too many coincidences begin to happen, Abby begins to investigate.<br /><br />This book is definitely not for the faint of heart and will surely make the reader think. I wondered if this really happens, it could and I hope it never gets to this point (but if someone can try to auction a kidney on e-Bay, then an organ black market is a remote possibility). There are enough variations in this book's plot to keep the identities of the villains at arm's length and will keep you guessing until the very end.<br /><br />And as for the ending - WOW! I haven't enjoyed an ending like this in a very long time! Gerritsen's experience as an internist clearly brings the reader into the operating room and gives a sense that the reader is actually there - dressed in scrubs, hearing, seeing and smelling the same things as are the doctors.

This tale takes the reader on a journey to Cordina, a small island under the rule of a royal family loved by the island residents. The Playboy Prince is the third book in the Cordina series, yet another trilogy written by Nora Roberts. This one was written in the beginning of her career and although not as great as her latest series, it is still excellent.<br /><br />Cordina reminds me of Monaco - an island surrounded by beautiful landscape, peaceful ocean, and dynamic architecture. The island is ruled by a kind king who truly cares for his subjects (do they still call them subjects?). The family is vivacious, drawing the reader into their antics to the point where you are almost like one of the family.<br /><br />The Playboy Prince focuses on Prince Bennett. His escapades are legend; his activities (especially where women are concerned) are fodder for not only the newspapers but the gossip columns as well. But when Lady Hannah Rothchild visits his sister, he can't understand his attraction to the quiet, prim and proper woman.<br /><br />What Prince Bennett doesn't know is that Lady Hannah Rothchild is an undercover security agent. She's been sent to the island to protect the royal family from the diabolical Deboque, a villain getting out of jail for his previous plot to kill the royal family and he only succeeded in kidnapping Prince Bennett's sister, Gabrielle. Since Deboque will be released from prison soon, it's only a matter of time before he attempts to seek revenge. Lady Hannah Rothchild has infiltrated Deboque's organization and has gained his trust. Now as a double agent, she must appear to carry out his plans, build a case against him, while keeping the royal family safe. No simple task when Prince Bennett keeps trying to break down her cool reserve and figure out what is hidden beneath her surface.<br /><br />Ok, so this is kind of a cookie cutter plot, but the intrigue adds to the romance. Nora Roberts is a master at building the suspense and mixing the right amount of romance in without going overboard. The book is predictable, but if you read enough of these romance books most of them are predictable. What's not expected is the mystery and build up - Deboque wants to blow up the palace in an explosion meant to kill the royal family. Setting those events into motion is exciting and keeps the reader very captivated.<br /><br />The Playboy Prince isn't one of Nora Roberts' best works, but it is definitely worth reading. With only 251 pages, most can finish it in an afternoon. The hardest part will be finding a copy of this book, as it is out of print and very hard to find. Seems there are many of Nora Roberts's earlier books that are very hard to find - too bad she doesn't reprint this earlier trilogy in one large paperback and market them like she has with the Donovan Legacy!ts is a master at building the suspense and mixing the right amount of romance in without going overboard.

Sea Swept is the first book in the Chesapeake Bay trilogy and one that will grip the reader and not let go. This is a very different style for Nora Roberts, as she is writing from the male perspective and not from the female. The trilogy revolves around three brothers who came from very different backgrounds, each with their own horror story. Each of these boys were adopted by Stella and Ray Quinn who made them believe they were worthy of love and they truly became a family. The trilogy picks up when these three brothers are adults.<br /><br />Sea Swept is the story of the wildest brother, Cameron Quinn. For years Cameron was independent and traveled on the racing circuit as a professional boat racer. He was a champion and enjoyed all that came with that title - fast cars, fast women, fast money, and a fast life. One night Cameron receives a phone call that puts a halt to that way of life and he races against the clock to make it to the hospital to be with his dying father, Ray Quinn. Cameron makes a deathbed promise to his father that he will help raise Seth, a young teenage boy his father has taken in just like the three older boys.<br /><br />So begins the tale of Cam trying to learn to live with his brothers again, while trying to learn about being a guardian. Cam realizes that he will no longer be able to travel the world racing boats, so he and his brothers, Phillip and Ethan, decide to build boats instead. The Brothers Quinn, boat building company is born.<br /><br />It's not a straight-forward story by any means. The new business is fine, but Nora Roberts has to throw in a few wrenches to make the story interesting and impossible to put down until the last page is read. It seems Seth's fate will be determined by a social work, Anna Spinelli. Anna is to evaluate the situation and decide if Phillip, Cam and Ethan will be able to raise Seth in an environment that will be suitable to an impressionable teenager. Now the real question is whether Anna can tame Cameron while still having Seth's best interest in mind.<br /><br />There have been mixed reviews on this series because it is such a detour from Nora Roberts' normal books. The male perspective is sometimes interesting and other times very funny. Since Roberts grew up with several brothers, she captures the male world perfectly. If you read this book with the idea that a man is writing it, you'll love it. If you read the book for pure content and enjoyment, you'll love it. But if you read it and want to compare it to other Nora Roberts books, you may be disappointed. So read it like you're reading a new author and enjoy each page!e Cameron while still having Seth's best interest in mind. <br /> <br />There have been mixed reviews on this series because it is such a detour from Nora Roberts' normal books.

Since I never read any of her romance books, I can't tell if her mysteries are an improvement or not. I can compare her to other romance-writers-turned-mystery-writers though. Hoag isn't the best mystery writer out there, but she's also far from the worst; I guess that would put her at mediocre or average.<br /><br />A Thin Dark Line has some great qualities and it has some less desirable aspects to it also. Hoag takes the reader on a journey into Southern Louisiana where vigilante justice is a way of life. A realtor is brutally murdered and the prime suspect is released on a technicality, which angers the entire town of Bayou Breaux. As the suspect, Marcus Renard, is leaving the courthouse, the father of the victim decides to take justice into his own hands. As he points the gun at Renard, his revenge is stopped by a police detective, Nick Fourcade, and a uniformed officer, Annie Broussard. This begins the journey that has Fourcade and Broussard trying to find the evidence that will put the killer behind bars for good before another murder is committed.<br /><br />When Annie stops a drunk Fourcade from beating Marcus Renard to death, the entire police department goes against her since she's turned on a \\"brother in blue\\". Annie's nightmare has only begun and she's not sure who is an enemy and who is an ally, as the killer begins to stalk her. Can she be sure who fired the shot at her while she pulls into her driveway? Who trailed the pig entrails and blood up the stairs to her home? Who mutilated a cat and hung it above her bed? Who tried to run her off the road and kill her near the bayou? Is it an angry police officer who feel she's betrayed the entire force, or the killer who targets her as his next victim since she physically resembles the dead realtor?<br /><br />It seems like Hoag has pulled every nightmare out of her reserve and uses them all in A Thin Dark Line. At one point it became expected that the next horror would fall on Annie, and was no surprise when it happened - again and again and again. Hoag needs to brush up on her suspense skills and learn the element of surprise like Iris Johansen has in her mystery genre books. Even Nora Roberts does a better job on suspense in River's End or Montana Sky.<br /><br />One of the most annoying nuances of this book was the constant use of the Cajun French in the dialog. Tami Hoag did provide a dictionary in the back of the book to translate these phrases, but I found myself constantly flipping to the back to see what was being said. It kinda takes away from the scene, to say the least, when you have to stop reading and look up the phrase. It was a nice thought that she did put the dictionary in the back, but there could have been a better way to accomplish getting the reader to understand the meaning without interrupting the flow of the story.<br /><br />A Thin Dark Line is the second mystery genre book by Tami Hoag that I've read. The first one, Still Waters was predictable. A Thin Dark Line was better but still has a long way to go to keep Tami Hoag at the top of the charts in this genre. If want to read a blockbuster full of suspense and action then I'd suggest any Iris Johansen or many of Nora Roberts' mystery books.

This is definitely one you won't be able to put down!<br /><br />Caitlin Bennett is a wealthy, beautiful author who receives a series of notes from a crazed fan.  As the notes become more threatening, Caitlin calls the police only to be told that nothing will come of them.  When Caitlin is shoved in front of a moving truck and lands in the hospital, her editor, Aaron Workman, calls in his stepbrother, Connor McKee, to help protect Caitlin.  Connor owns a security company and becomes Caitlin's bodyguard.<br /><br />Sounds like a typical thriller, right?  Nope, the crux of the matter is that Connor and Caitlin have never gotten along.  The barbs tossed at each other keep the reader entertained while Sala sets up the mystery.<br /><br />Murder victims continue to show up, as do the letters to Caitlin.  When the police realize that these victims have an uncanny resemblance to Caitlin, they begin to believe there might be something behind the correspondence and deduce that Caitlin is the main target.  Great, they finally figure it out, but can they protect her?  Luckily she has Connor to do it and he has his hands full with that job.<br /><br />The character development is excellent.  We are introduced to two dynamic personalities and shown that the struggle to be civil between the two can lead to a few amusing situations.  It can also lead to romance without reducing the strong wills to anything less.  And Aaron's character is just fun - he's the perfect ditzy friend that every girl needs in her life - Sala captured his essence flawlessly.  Kenny, the publicist that thinks he is Mr. Wonderful, leaves everyone wanting to just smack some sense into him.  I wanted to shout that he needed to get over himself.  Character development on Kenny has the reader relating to others who think they are God's Gift to the World and even groaning out loud at some of his antics.<br /><br />It is a bit strange, however, in that murders take place during storms.  I wondered if it was Sala's way of saying she was tired of winter?  With the winter we've had this year, many can relate to that way of thinking!<br /><br />SNOWFALL is very suspenseful and intriguing.  It's very difficult to put down once you have started reading.

Sala grabs the reader from the very beginning and doesn't let go!<br /><br />Jade Cochrane is a street artist on the run.  When she was 6 years old, her upper-middle-class mother kidnapped her.  Her mother was looking for love in all the wrong places and joined a commune, The People of Joy.  Yes, commune complete with pot smoking hippies and orgies!  After her mother dies unexpectedly, Jade is prostituted to pedophiles, as are the other children in the commune.  When an over-zealous man almost kills Jade, her friend, Raphael comes to her rescue and they begin life on the run.  If The People of Joy catch them, they will surely die.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Jade unknowingly sells one of her paintings to a friend of her father's who has never lost hope in finding his daughter.  Sam Cochrane hires Luke Kelly, a security expert, to find Jade when he sees the painting.  This is almost too easily accomplished to make it believable and left me wondering how anyone could believe finding a lost one was that easy.  Hey, maybe we should all employ Luke Kelly and there would not be anyone missing.  But the real fun begins when Luke brings Jade back to her father.  It's a highly publicized reunion leaving the People of Joy and former customers beginning to worry that Jade will tell of their crimes and they will go to prison.<br /><br />It seems like a storyline that has been used many times before, and it is.  But Sala puts a few new sub-plots into the mix and makes for a very enjoyable story.  Raphael's death and subsequent \\"appearances\\" to Jade are pleasant even though far-fetched.  And the irony of the \\"john's\\" true identity will leave the reader wondering who else in public office has skeletons like these in their closets!<br /><br />Character development is done with memory flashbacks of Jade's childhood and a few of her teenage years.  We're given a glimpse of how horrible her life was in the commune, and although free as a street painter, she must always look over her shoulder to keep from being recaptured.  Raphael is also developed this way but not in such detail.  Luke Kelly is developed in the present and yes, the reader can predict the attraction between Kelly and Jade.<br /><br />This is a suspense book yet has all the makings of a romance, but also has a moral message.  It's a feel good book at the end, but definitely not in the beginning when the abuse is described in vivid detail.  It keeps the reader guessing as to what will come next for Jade.<br /><br />My suggestion is to have another Sharon Sala book handy.

Big Bad Wolf, Part 2	Ok, I was expecting more fireworks than London Bridges brought - hey it was Alex Cross versus the Big Bad Wolf again.  It was a good time reading it, but it fell short of my expectations.<br /><br />The Russian mobster (The Wolf) forces the Weasel (Geoffrey Shafer from previous books) to join his escapades in terrorizing the world.  I personally thought The Weasel was better than this - to be captured so easily by The Wolf left me shaking my head - was Shafer really not as smart as previously thought?  I guess so.<br /><br />The first glimpse we are given to the destruction ahead is when they blow up a small town in Nevada.  Only one person is killed when he refuses to leave as directed by \\"army\\" personnel.  Of course the entire episode is video taped and given to the FBI.  To show this wasn't a fluke a small village in England is destroyed shortly after the town in Nevada but this time without evacuating the townspeople.  The Wolf definitely has everyone's attention at this point.  After The Wolf and his group show the devastation that can be had, they extort money by targeting four big cities:  Frankfort, London, Washington DC and New York City.  It's a race against time to stop The Wolf before annihilation occurs.<br /><br />Character development continues to be excellent in this novel.  Alex Cross seems to be at a crossroads and questions his career choice as he visits Little Alex in Washington state.  Could Patterson be thinking of moving the Cross family across the country in the near future?<br /><br />The subplots are a bit weak - Jamilla is given only a couple of pages in this book; Little Alex is also given about the same amount of space; and the entire subplot of Geoffrey Shafer is anti-climatic at best.  In fact, the end of Shafer left me wondering - I thought he was tougher than that!<br /><br />Patterson does an excellent job at keeping the reader guessing the identities of those involved with The Wolf.  Just when you think you have his accomplices figured out, he throws you a curve ball.  Yep, it definitely kept me on my toes!<br /><br />Overall it's a very good book, but not one of Patterson's finest.  It was just missing that something extra I've come to expect with James Patterson.Yep, it definitely kept me on my toes!    Overall it's a very good book, but not one of Patterson's finest.

This is one of those books that are so rare very few are able to read it. Since Nora Roberts' popularity has soared, this story was included in a book entitled Night Tales - a reissuance of our of Roberts' stories.<br /><br />Night Shadow was an interesting story even if a bit farfetched. It's sort of like a new comic book hero - similar to the Lois and Superman story line of years ago. But if you can get past the cartoonish aspects, then you'll enjoy the rest.<br /><br />Deborah O'Roarke (sister to Cilla O'Roarke from Night Shift) is an assistant district attorney in Urbana (very similar to New York City by all indications and descriptions). Deb interviews a witness to a drive-by shooting in a bad part of town and on her way to her car, she is grabbed and drug into an alley. Before she's accosted, a masked hero intervenes. Nemesis as he's known, thwarts the attack and then lectures Deb on being more careful. The reprimand doesn't go over well but Nemesis has definitely made an impression.<br /><br />Then Deb meets a multi-millionaire at a social gathering and is smitten. She begins to feel something toward Gage Guthrie, the handsome, hulky, millionaire, but since Nemesis keeps turning up to save her, she also has feelings for him.<br /><br />The confusion isn't helped any when Deb keeps finding herself in danger while investigating a case and Nemesis always comes to the rescue. She's torn between the two - Gage and Nemesis - and very confused.<br /><br />When she learns that Nemesis is really Gage, she's angry for being deceived yet relieved that she's really in love with only one man and not two. Ok, so it's a bit strange, but it is interesting not only watching the love between these two develop, but also trying to figure out whom is behind the threats and killings that both Gage and Deb are investigating.<br /><br />The romance is interesting, but when you have Gage torn between his hero mode and trying to keep Deb safe from villains, it puts a new twist on the entire story.

P is for Peril is the another of Sue Grafton's quests to cover the entire alphabet with Kinsey Millhone mysteries. It's a very good mystery, but G is for Gumshoe still has to be my favorite!<br /><br />P is for Peril has Kinsey hired by a bitter ex-wife to try to find a missing doctor. Dr. Dowan Purcell disappeared leaving many unanswered questions and speculation of fraudulent Medicare claims at the nursing home he runs. There seem to be many questions and no answers, so it's Kinsey's job to try to find him and get those answers.<br /><br />Seems like a simple cookie-cutter type mystery plot, right? Not on your life! Throw in the current wife, a former stripper, with a teenage daughter whose sole purpose in life is to annoy adults and despise any and all authority. This current wife, Crystal, is rumored to be having an affair with her personal trainer. Then there's Crystal's ex-husband who still believes she's coming back to him.<br /><br />When Kinsey finds the good doctor's body, murder and not suicide is the outcome and these characters each have their own motives for wanting him dead. Even though she's off the case, Kinsey can't let it go and digs even deeper to find the identity of the killer. Seems like Kinsey Millhone has taken on some personality characteristics of Eve Dallas, of J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) fame - one who \\"stands for the dead\\". Hmm, could Sue Grafton be a J.D. Robb fan?<br /><br />Where this novel falls short is the reader doesn't feel anything for these characters. Crystal fades in and out of witchiness (Epinions won't let me use the other word for this). Fiona (the ex-wife) is just a plain nut case and wants the status of being married to a doctor. Then there's stepdaughter who's spoiled rotten and needs military school instead of a fancy boarding school. And why is she like this? In my opinion it's because her mother can't be bothered, she even has a nanny for her toddler son, so she can sit on the deck and eat cheese and drink wine. Yep, life must be hard if you're an ex-stripper, married to a doctor and living the good life!<br /><br />A sub-plot has Kinsey looking for new office space and she meets a hunky landlord and his oddball brother. This could have been an entire book by itself if the story line was better developed. In fact, it might have been a very interesting tale with a bit more added. This entire sub-plot was rushed and the reader had to hurry to try to keep up. Then before you know it, it's over. Very anti-climatic to say the least!<br /><br />But the saddest part was when I read the last page and there wasn't the usual closure, \\"Respectfully submitted, Kinsey Millhone\\". Come on, Ms. Grafton, where's the ending we've all come to know and love? Instead we're given an Alfred Hitchcock type ending where the reader surmises what will happen. The ends aren't tied up in neat little bows that we expect when reading one of the Alphabet Mysteries. This change from tradition left me wanting the old style back. I want the \\"Respectfully submitted\\" back in the ending and not a guessing what happened type ending.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, P is for Peril is still a very good book and will have you guessing in several places. In my opinion, it's just not as wonderful as we've come to expect from Sue Grafton and her heroine, Kinsey Millhone.

It was selected by Bookspan as the \\"2005 International Thriller of the Year\\".  But we're only in the 3rd month of 2005 and I would hope there are many more books on the horizon that will give this mystery a run for this title!<br /><br />James Patterson teams up with Howard Roughan on this book and their writing styles are similar enough so that the reader doesn't realize which author is at the helm; you don't experience the jumping from author to author as you do in other books.  There are a few twists along the way, but the book is predictable without taking away from its appeal.<br /><br />FBI agent John O'Hara is assigned the task of trying to pin a series of murders on Nora Sinclair, an interior decorator that uses her job to lure very rich, potential lovers.  Nora loves money and decides that the only way to continue in the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed is to milk her lovers within minutes of killing them.  She seems to have a string of men waiting in the wings for her charms, keeping her off shore account in the Cayman Islands ever growing.<br /><br />John O'Hara must try to outwit Nora as he poses as an insurance investigator with a million dollar life insurance policy naming her as the beneficiary.  The attraction between the two is strong, and he must try to keep his lust at bay or it could kill him.<br /><br />Character development is excellent, as we're given glimpses into O'Hara and Sinclair's lives and the interactions between the two.  There is always a hint of humor with Patterson, and this book is no different (as showcased with the interlude between O'Hara and his ex-wife - that scene was priceless!).  However, I didn't fall in love with these characters as I have with Alex Cross or the females from the Women's Murder Club that Patterson has created.<br /><br />Although an excellent read, Honeymoon is not a book that I'm anxiously awaiting to hear if the character of John O'Hara continues in another book.  It was fun, it had interesting twists along the way, but when it was over, I had no problem putting it on my shelf and moving on.of John O'Hara continues in another book.

All have mystical magic included and are set in times of knights, sorceresses, and royal families. Being a Noraholic (die-hard fan of Nora Roberts) I picked up a copy with the purpose of reading her portion of the book and tossing it into the library bin for others to read. Once I started, I decided to read the entire book and not just Nora's story. So here's what I think on each of the tales:<br /><br />Spellbound by Nora Roberts<br /><br />A delightful tale that actually is set in modern times with \\"memories\\" set back in ancient times of knights and witches. Brynna is an Irish witch. Calin is an American photographer. When Calin was young, he had an active imagination; at least that's what they termed it since he had a friend that no one else saw, and he knew things that he couldn't possibly have experienced (or could he).<br /><br />Calin once again starts dreaming the dreams of the past and wonders if he's having a nervous breakdown. His parents convince him that he needs a vacation and suggest he go with them to Montana. Before he thinks, he blurts out that he's going to Ireland. He seems to have an agenda that he doesn't even know - he rents a car and drives to an enchanted castle and sees the woman from his dreams. She's gorgeous, she's everything he remembers, and she's Brynna, a witch.<br /><br />The story gets a bit slow when Brynna is trying to let Calin remember their \\"past\\" on his own, all the while battling a wicked witch. The battling of Alasdair is not slow, but the bouncing from past to present is a bit tedious. It seems a legend has it that if Calin doesn't pledge his true love to Brynna within 24 hours (which is exactly 1,000 years since the curse has been enacted), then she must become Alasdair's mate.<br /><br />The story ends with a clash, lots of magic, and tons of undying love. Ah, yes, a pure romantic, 'happily ever after' type tale.<br /><br />It's interesting, but not as well developed as I've come to expect from Nora Roberts. It could very well have something to do with the short length of the story (each of these tales runs just under 100 pages). I wish she'd do a rewrite and fully develop the characters and plot - it would make a very interesting full-length book!<br /><br />Castle Doom by Jill Gregory<br /><br />This is the first literary work I've read of Jill Gregory and if this story is any indication of her talents, I'll definitely be reading more of her work in the future.<br /><br />Castle Doom throws us into the middle of a battle over a kingdom. When Marcus, count of a neighboring land, went to talk with Archduke Julian about his reign of terrorism, he was thrown in the dungeon and is now about to be hanged. His sister, Arianne, vows to free him and sends word to Marcus' childhood friend, Nicolas that his life is in jeopardy. Nicolas arrives to rescue his pal and must match wits with his half-brother Julian in order to keep Arianne safe and free Marcus.<br /><br />This story shows lots of various emotions, ranging from friendship to love to hatred to conceit; it definitely runs the gamut of feelings. It is also filled with humor and you'll find yourself chuckling several times in the short life span of this story.<br /><br />Again, I wish it could have been lengthened a bit, but it was a quick and very enjoyable reading adventure!<br /><br />Falcon's Lair by Ruth Ryan Langan<br /><br />Of the four stories, this is the only one that I really didn't like at all. Felicity, a young American woman, travels to England when she receives a message that her father's old friend needs him. Since her father has recently passed away, she takes it upon herself to go even though she's never met this man, nor does she know what assistance he needs.<br /><br />Felicity finds herself at the home of Lord Falcon and is thrown into a plot for murder. It is believed that a curse follows the Lords of Falcon's Lair and all of the menare doomed to an early demise. The oldest son of Lord Falcon, Chandler, has been missing in the Amazon jungles; the youngest son, William, was injured in a riding accident and is bedridden and slowing dying; while Lord Falcon shows signs of quickly failing health and his death seems eminent.<br /><br />Felicity begins to uncover mysteries that surround these events and her life is then in danger. But when someone tries to push her down a staircase, her friendly ghost catches her just in time to save her life. This ghost is Gareth, the first Lord of Falcon's Lair and he appears to Felicity to point her in the right directions to help her solve the crimes. Not only is he a ghost, but he shape changes into a Falcon and flies off frequently.<br /><br />The part that I don't like, or understand, is how a woman can fall in love with and have a romantic interlude with a ghost. Yes, it happened and I'm still shaking my head and wondering how and why. The story line is weak and contrived. The characters are well described and you can see the mental pictures clearly. Even with that clarity, I shook my head and wondered. This was a stretch for even my imagination!<br /><br />Then there's the ending. You can see this one coming for miles and when it does finally get there, it's boring and anti-climatic. There's little imagination as to the plot and I would definitely recommend that you skip this short story altogether!<br /><br />Dragonspell by Marianne Willman<br /><br />This story showed a lot of humor along with the romance, which kept it from being predictable and made it highly enjoyable.<br /><br />Princess Tressalara found her kingdom under attack and her father murdered by his top knight, Lector. She fled before she was forced to marry Lector and as she was planning her overthrow, she ran into Cador of Kildore, the most feared knight in the land. Since Tressalara is dressed as a young lad, Kildore at first believes the ruse and takes her to the camp as another sworn to help overthrow the villain Lector. Once he realizes exactly who Tressalara is, it's too late to keep from losing his heart to her.<br /><br />Princess Tressalara is the ultimate in the fairy tale princesses - she's beautiful, kind hearted, and devoted to her subjects. Cador of Kildore, is the ultimate in knights - he's gorgeous, proud and brave. Yes, it was truly a perfect match.<br /><br />The humor comes in with a subplot of two sorcerers and their ineptness. One is assigned to Cador and the other to Tressalara. In their attempts to help their humans remain safe, they have a series of mishaps that are hilarious. They turn themselves into frogs, into swans, and into mice. They spit at each other, and snipe at each other, but they always try to do what's best for their humans. It was a truly fun way to keep the reader glued to her chair and turning those pages as fast as she could read! This was a fun sideline.<br /><br />If this humor and excellent weaving of a story line is any indication of Marianne Willman's writing abilities, then I'll definitely find more of her work.<br /><br />My Conclusion<br /><br />Three of the four stories were very good which makes the book definitely worth reading. I'd suggest skipping over Falcon's Lair but read and enjoy the others. The best part of anthologies such as this is when you get the book because of an author you really like and then you're introduced to new authors that you enjoy.

Guilty as Sin is the conclusion to Tami Hoag's Night Sins but could also be considered a stand-alone type novel.<br /><br />In Night Sins we learn about the kidnapping of Josh Kirkwood a nine-year-old boy living in a small town in Minnesota. The horrible crime rocks the peaceful feeling and security of those that live there, but none so much as the parents of this child. At the end of Night Sins a villain is captured - Dr. Garrett Wright, a local college professor, and neighbor and friend to the Kirkwoods.<br /><br />Guilty as Sin picks up right where Night Sins leaves off. However, instead of continuing the focus on the Kirkwood family and the law enforcement officers trying to find the child, Guilty as Sin focuses on Ellen North, an Assistant County Prosecutor who is trying to put Dr. Garrett Wright away for this heinous crime.<br /><br />Along the way, we learn that Dr. Wright isn't working alone and has an accomplice, but the identity of that second villain is lost in a slew of subplots and support characters.<br /><br />Tami Hoag floods the reader with a cast of support characters to the point of confusion:<br /><br />Jay Butler Brooks - author of true crime novels, comes to Minnesota to research the kidnapping and trial for a new book.<br /><br />Dennis Enberg - the defense attorney, originally representing Wright who commits suicide after he's removed from the case - or was it suicide?<br /><br />Hannah Garrison - mother to Josh Kirkwood, ER doctor, and all around nice person who embodies the perfect mother/wife/career woman.<br /><br />Paul Kirkwood - father to Josh Kirkwood, husband to Hannah, who is so self absorbed that he can't feel for anyone but himself.<br /><br />Tom McCoy - local Catholic priest who starts to doubt his faith and wonders at his calling.<br /><br />Christopher Priest - professor at Harris College, co-worker with Garrett Wright<br /><br />Sci-Fi Cowboys - a group of juvenile delinquents that are brought to Harris College to make something respectable out of their lives and are under the guidance of Garrett Wright and Christopher Priest.<br /><br />Phoebe - Ellen North's secretary and right-hand assistant who is a little on the eccentric side<br /><br />Todd Childs - student and protege of Garrett Wright and Christopher Priest<br /><br />Adam Slater - reporter from a small town mid-western newspaper who has his eyes on Phoebe<br /><br />Tony Costello - sleezebag defense attorney who gets called in to represent Garrett Wright and who just happens to have a past with Ellen North.<br /><br />With so many subplots going on, it is difficult at times to follow the story line and left me wishing more could be devoted to the subplots I enjoyed and less to those that I didn't. For example, Todd Childs being a stoner and working in a thrift store left me shrugging and wondering why he was even included in the story for more than a mention in passing. On the other hand, Ellen North's previous involvement with Tony Costello could have been expanded with a possible flashback to the actual events that led to their breakup instead of a few words mentioned here and there so the reader will eventually get the drift.<br /><br />The overall story was a good one, but long - over 600 pages. Ellen North is feisty, interesting, clever, and impassioned. She's an excellent protagonist. The accomplice (no I won't tell you his/her identity) is indistinct because of so many characters that this identity is convoluted. This is one of the few mysteries that I didn't figure out the \\"other\\" villain but I wasn't surprised either.<br /><br />The ending is a page-turner and the last 50 pages will be read quickly. You'll hold your breath hoping you've sensed the outcome correctly. And you won't be disappointed.

US	51874804	R31CNDUYJIDE5H	0446606383	390445968	The Midnight Club	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Another Pure Evil Villain	I've read a couple of non-Alex Cross books written by James Patterson and didn't feel they had the same intrigue and style that I enjoyed when Alex Cross was the featured character. I picked up a copy of The Midnight Club and had it sit on my desk for a few weeks before working up the courage to read it. I'm glad I did finally read it, as it was fantastic!<br /><br />The story line focuses on John Stefanovich, a New York detective, who was paralyzed in the line of duty and has made it his life's mission to make the person responsible for his injuries, and the deaths of his partner and wife, pay for these crimes. Alexandre St. Germain is that villain and is the embodiment of evil.<br /><br />The subplots are also excellent and keep the reader on the edge of your seat. Entering into the picture is a rookie cop that the reader isn't sure can be trusted. We're given glimpses of a life growing up, struggling to survive with a powerful influence of an older brother who finally makes it out of a life of poverty only to have that life taken. This was the reason behind a career choice as a cop.<br /><br />Another subplot is that of a book-writing lady who befriends John Stefanovich and thus endangers herself and her son. The writer and handicapped cop relationship has been done before and Patterson doesn't introduce anything new into this mix which is a mild disappointment. It all just seems to be a repeat of an earlier performance.<br /><br />Alexandre St. Germain is another of the ultimate sadistic villains created by James Patterson and I must say the creation of these villains is one of this writer's strong attributes. Each time I read one of these pieces of work, I wonder if these bad guys can get any worse - we've seen Gary Soneji, Cassanova and now St. Germain. And to answer my pondering question: YES, they can and do get worse, each in their own horrible way. They are evil, pure evil - there's no other way to describe them!<br /><br />James Patterson has done an excellent job in this page-turner. The characters are strong and believable. The plot and subplots are well laid out (at times too well laid out causing some predictability). The suspense is excellent. On the down side, there are a few scenes that are a bit too much to be credible, but those scenes are few and far between.<br /><br />If you enjoy Patterson's Alex Cross books, pick up a copy of The Midnight Club.

I always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup of tea. While reading Conspiracy in Death I realized I couldn't have been more wrong - I love this futuristic series!<br /><br />A homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to Eve Dallas, since it's not a random act of violence. This man, Snooks, died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon. When Dallas digs a bit further, she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in New York City where an aged LC (licensed companion) died as the result of her liver being removed. After even more digging, Dallas discovers a case in Chicago and one abroad that were all similar.<br /><br />These were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying. In order for Eve Dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen. The closer she got to that answer, the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became.<br /><br />When she got too close to the truth, the villain had to put a stop to her investigation. The best way to get Dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department. This was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered Snook's body and Dallas. When that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on Dallas. Stripped of her badge and weapon, the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life, she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective, but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied.<br /><br />The main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise. There was excellent character development and as usual J.D. Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book. What makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of Eve Dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that. At times, it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot.<br /><br />This is definitely one to read, as all of the \\"In Death\\" series books have been. Start with the first book when reading because J.D. Robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings. Or you can start with the first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent adventure!ook above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of Eve Dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that.

A few years ago a friend recommended a new author to me. She said Jeffrey Deavers was absolutely wonderful. Due to new releases by some of my favorite authors, and time constraints with life, I was unable to read any work by Jeffrey Deavers until about 6 months after her suggestion.  Now I realize that delay was one mistake I won't make again.<br /><br />The Bone Collector was the type of book that grabs the reader from the first page and doesn't' let go until the very last page. It is my definition of a Thriller!<br /><br />Quadriplegic Lincoln Rhyme remains one of the foremost authorities on forensic science, even though he's retired. He's an expert in identifying physical evidence and no one comes close to his expertise. Lincoln sustained his injuries on a crime scene when a beam collapsed on him, shattering his C4 vertebrae. He's given up hope and just wants to die - the last thing on his mind is going back to work.<br /><br />That is until he's approached and conned into helping out on a chilling case. A man is found near train tracks buried alive. Clues have been left as to where the next victim can be found and if the law enforcement team hurries they can save her. And that won't be the last victim, so it's a race against the clock to not only save the victims, but to find the identity of the killer.<br /><br />Working with Lincoln Rhyme is Amelia Sachs, a police officer who was first on scene that morning with the buried man. She becomes Lincoln's legs and eyes on the crime scenes looking and bagging physical evidence to be examined back at the makeshift lab in Lincoln's bedroom.<br /><br />Joining the team are a few other law officers, including Jim Rollings, usually busy meeting with city officials and the media. Thom, Lincoln's assistant/nurse who is there to help him with any task needed and who also doesn't let his bad attitude affect anyone. Then there are a few doctors who come and go, one of them is a doctor of death that is supposed to help Lincoln end it all. And let's not forget the host of law enforcement officers who come and go throughout the book.<br /><br />One good writing quality that Jeffrey Deavers exhibits is the weaving of characters in and out of each other's lives. Amelia Sachs becomes very close to Lincoln Rhyme and we see that both have suffered because of their love for law enforcement. Thom is found to be a good friend besides an excellent nurse. It seems that only a few characters are left undeveloped and only appear as a fleeting image on the pages. Deavers introduces the reader to almost all of the characters and that introduction includes getting to know each of them.<br /><br />But hands down, the best part of the book is the intrigue, the chilling serial killings, and race to find the murderer. There were times that my heart thundered as I ran with Amelia Sachs to try to save a victim. And trying to figure out the clues was almost as much fun as reading about Rhyme and Sachs figuring them out!<br /><br />I consider myself an expert in mysteries - very seldom do they fool me as to the true identity of the villain. Well, I was fooled with this one. I was so misguided that I actually cheered out loud when I realized just how wrong I was. Ah yes, the ultimate twist at the end will leave the reader out of breath and craving the next book by Jeffrey Deavers!o help Lincoln end it all.

I'm amazed at the number of publications Roberts produces each year, and wonder if these smaller books are whipped out in a couple of months.<br /><br />Night Shield is a continuation of the Night Tales series from several years ago (Night Shift, Nightshade, Night Shadow and Night Smoke). It introduces the reader to the offspring of the characters that we fell in love with in the original Night series.<br /><br />Allison Fletcher (daughter to Boyd and Cilla Fletcher - Night Shift fame) is a new detective and lands a big case trying to solve a series of thefts that seem to target upper middle class couples. The only common thread among most of the couples is that they are at a popular club, Blackhawk's, while the robbery is taking place. Allison goes undercover posing as a waitress to try and figure out who is behind these break-ins.<br /><br />Jonah Blackhawk is the owner of Blackhawk's and a few other popular nightclubs in the Denver area. He grew up on the street and credits Boyd Fletcher with turning him into a solid upstanding citizen. When Jonah agrees to help with the case, little did he know that he would be working with Boyd's daughter - a gorgeous blonde. What Jonah didn't realize was that both he and Allison were strong willed, hard headed, and instantly attracted to each other.<br /><br />Nora Roberts once again shows her expertise at romance writing with believable characters, interesting plot lines and even throws in a couple of interesting subplots to round things out. Roberts has a knack for creating characters with wit, charm, down-to-earth personalities and even a flaw or two to make them believable.<br /><br />One of the small details that I enjoyed in Night Shield was the reference to characters from previous books. Remember the story about the photographers going across country on a photo shoot? The book was called One Summer and the photographers were Shade Colby and Bryan Mitchell. While in Jonah's office, Allison notices a photograph and mentions that she too enjoys Shade Colby's work and a short discussion follows about both photographers. Another mention of past characters involved a family barbecue at the Fletcher's home that included everyone from the previous Night Tales books. Not only did we get a quick glimpse at the characters we came to know and love in the previous books, we got to understand that they were doing well. I'm hoping that by mentioning their children who were present at the barbecue, that Nora Roberts has ideas for more books about this group in the near future.<br /><br />While reading Night Shield doesn't mean a cerebral exercise, it is definitely an exercise in enjoyment. With only 245 pages, it makes for a quick read and the romantic in you will sigh when you finish that last page. Definitely one of those \\"feel good\\" type books that are definitely worth the price at a bookstore!s were Shade Colby and Bryan Mitchell.

Soon she realizes that a serial killer is on the loose and the targets are newlyweds.<br /><br />Since the case is high profile, she is given a new partner, Chris Raleigh, a guy who's been a PR cop for most of his career. Instead of trusting Chris, Lindsay turns to her pal, Medical Examiner Claire Washburn, with whom she bounces ideas. Soon, a group is formed and the membership is exclusive. The Women's Murder Club has four members - Lindsay, Claire, assistant District Attorney;  Jill Bernhardt; and reporter Cindy Thomas. These are the women who solve the case.<br /><br />The idea of Chris and Lindsay being romantically involved is obvious from the beginning. The mystery behind the murders is predictable. And then there is the humor thrown in just to balance the mix. That part is excellent.<br /><br />And now the ending... ok, so I knew the identity of the killer and knew that Chris and Lindsay would become \\"involved\\". It was still a great book to read, even though it was unsurprising. What I didn't like was the twist at the very end. I don't want to give it away for those who want to read this book, but to me this unexpected twist was both unnecessary and seemed to cheapen the story line. Patterson should have just let it go and stopped 10 pages earlier!	2005-03-21

Nora Roberts. And once again the reader is treated to an amazing adventure complete with grand subplots and interesting twists and turns along the way. A combination of mystery, science fiction and romance, Witness in Death is an excellent story!<br /><br />Eve Dallas is again thrown into the middle of a murder, except this time she is not only the primary investigating detective on the case, but also a witness. While she and her wealthy husband, Roarke, enjoy the opening night of a new Broadway play, murder happens right in front of the entire audience. The main actor, Richard Draco, is killed when the prop knife is switched for a real knife. It's Eve's job to find the killer's identity. Ok, so it seems as if this is a plot right out of the game Clue. Any die-hard Nora Roberts fan knows that she always throws a few twists and turns in along the way and Witness in Death is no different.<br /><br />What's different about this particular homicide is that the murder was committed in front of an entire audience, along with cast members and stage crew. Any one of them could have had the opportunity to kill Draco, but finding him/her was another problem for Dallas.<br /><br />During the investigation, the reader is enlightened with Richard Draco's personality traits and lifestyle. He's an egomaniac who has made more enemies than friends, and doesn't mind trampling anyone in his way. He's enjoyed many battles where he humiliates his opponent with any means necessary to be the victor. He's enjoyed using women all of his life, and the daughter given up for adoption at birth was his mistress (hey, she didn't know he was her father, so he figured she was fair game). With so many enemies, the difficulty was narrowing down those who wanted to kill him into the one that actually committed the crime.<br /><br />And a reoccurring theme for Robb/Roberts is the fact that someone close to her is a suspect in the murder. This time it's Nadine Furst, the channel 75 news reporter. For those that have read this series from the beginning: In a previous book she was a victim, but not a suspect, so this is not a repeat on the suspect list. Seems Nadine and Draco had a fling years before and he broke Nadine's heart. When Dallas finds out that Nadine had dinner with him the evening before he died, she begins to wonder if she can help her friend remain anonymous. Then when a video is found of Nadine and Draco in a bout of sex, she's moved to the short list of suspects.<br /><br />If this murder mystery wasn't enough, one of my favorite subplots continues in Witness in Death. Ian McNabb and Delia Peabody continue their romantic interlude, and it's a hoot. They just can't get enough of each other, and neither will admit that there is more there than pure lust. Between the hilarious idea of these two opposites together and the uneasiness of Dallas and Feeney (supervisors to McNabb and Peabody) with an office romance, you'll chuckle away. This subplot is fantastic.<br /><br />Witness in Death is a very enjoyable book by one of my favorite authors. As usual from Robb/Roberts, this book is filled with obscurity, humor, and you can always count on a few twists and turns to keep the journey lively.

One of the things that sets Nora Roberts above other authors is her ability to produce a trilogy that gets better with each book. By the time you read the third and last book, you're left wanting even more. That's definitely how I felt after reading the Born In trilogy.<br /><br />In Born in Fire we were introduced to hot-tempered Maggie, Thomas Concannon's oldest daughter. In Born in Ice we were introduced to cool and reserved Brianna, Concannon's second daughter. Now in the third and last of the trilogy, we meet Shannon Bodine, the illegitimate daughter of Thomas Concannon. We finally learn about Amanda (the woman who came into Thomas' life and showed him how to love again after years of marriage to a heartless woman). We learn more about Maggie and Brianna's mother and her life of misery. We also learn about the unborn child Amanda carried with her to America all those years ago when she left Thomas.<br /><br />Shannon grew up in America and didn't know that her real father was actually an Irishman she had never met. When her parents die, she learns the truth and sets out to fulfill her mother's dying wish that she meet the sisters she never knew she had. Shannon travels to County Clare, Ireland not really knowing what to expect and still reeling from confusion.<br /><br />It's not an easy meeting, but a bond begins to grow between Shannon, Maggie and Brianna. While they're blazing new ground and learning about each other, Shannon also must deal with her attraction to long-time Concannon family friend and neighbor, Murphy Muldoon. This is where the story differs from other Nora Roberts books. Roberts shows a magical love that is timeless - the destiny of two lovers from long ago brought back to the present so they could possibly reunite if only they open their minds and hearts. The underlying message is simple - true love is eternal.<br /><br />I've read other reviews and spoken with many people about this series, and this book is definitely one up for debate. The \\"paranormal elements\\" of encounters in past lives between these two characters and flashbacks to show that past relationship aren't received by some readers with an open mind. I found it to be an interesting twist and added a new dimension to the overall story line. If you liked the Donovan series (the tales about the three witch cousins, Morgana, Anastasia and Sabastian) then you should love this trilogy. This is definitely not your cookie-cutter romance plot.<br /><br />I feel the characters are strong and developed well. The reader is given more insight into Murphy Muldoon and from the glimpses we were given in the first two books, this is a nice option. If you believe that true love is eternal, then it explains why Maggie and Brianna were never interested romantically in the hunk that lived next door!<br /><br />As with other Silhouette romance books, this is short and provides a quick read. It's a great way to spend a cold afternoon and will make you feel warm inside.bate.

One of Nora Roberts' most dynamic family creations is the O'Hurley family. Frank and Mary O'Hurley are the parents of very talented children and the stage is their home - they are traveling musicians/singers/dancers and go from performance to performance. Frank and Mary's first born is Trace, who plays the piano for the family act while his sisters, mother, and father dance and sing. IN the family chronology, after Trace came a set of triplets: Chantel, Abigail and Maddy. Chantel's story was told in Skin Deep, Abigail's story was narrated in The Last Honest Woman and Maddy's story was recounted in Dance to the Piper. In Without a Trace we finally get to learn about the brother of this group - the quiet one who left the family act and seemed to disappear off the face of the earth.<br /><br />Trace and his father had always been at odds with each other and as Trace got older, it was more difficult for him to understand why his father pushed the family the way he did. During one of these heated arguments, Trace walked away from his family only to be heard from infrequently since. Trace struck out on his own and didn't want commitments or responsibilities - he was basically a talented drifter using his musical abilities to provide food and shelter. At a seedy bar in a foreign country, Trace was approached and became a modern day mercenary/spy. Without a Trace picks up at the end of this secret agent type career with Trace trying to figure out where he wants his life to travel next. As fate would have it, into his life walks Gillian Fitzpatrick. Gillian's brother had disappeared under mysterious circumstances and she needs Trace to help her find him. Of course the sexual chemistry is there to add spice to this tale of intrigue.<br /><br />Nora Roberts deviates from the standard romance genre in Without a Trace and throws a little mystery and suspense into the mix. It's enough to keep the reader interested and results in the book being a \\"page turner\\". Some of the plot lines are a little far-fetched but somehow Roberts takes them from a \\"no way would that happen\\" to a \\"well, maybe\\" type of thinking.<br /><br />Once again Nora Roberts shows her devoted readers why they should remain diehard fans - the story is one that has wit, humor, romance and excitement. While I was reading the books about the O'Hurley triplets, I often wondered what had happened to Trace, as his sisters were always wistfully thinking about him. And it seemed like he never showed up for the important things in their lives (weddings, births of babies, etc.) but sent word to them instead. If he was able to show up, it was a very special occasion and resulted in much celebration. You could always feel the love this family had for each other, and Trace was always the quiet, mysterious one that the reader never heard much about. Nora Roberts built up the suspense through three previous books before we finally get to learn all about Trace. After reading Without a Trace I can tell you that it was definitely worth the wait! Now maybe Nora Roberts will continue with this family like she has with the MacGregor Clan and tell the tales of the offspring of the O'Hurley siblings.

For those that don't know, J.D. Robb is the alter ego of Nora Roberts and the futuristic environment is her forte. Robb has created a strong female lead character in Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas and spices up the cast with a strong male character in Roarke, Eve's lover whom we met in the first book of the series, Naked in Death.<br /><br />Glory in Death focuses on the murders of two beautiful and very successful women. One of the main connections is that they were both involved with Roarke in his not so distant past. This causes some friction in the developing relationship between Eve and Roarke, but that just adds to the flavor and entices the reader to peruse a bit faster! Eve Dallas is the primary detective on this new case and we learn much about her past and why her personality is so strong.<br /><br />I'm not sure which part of this book I enjoyed more - the evolving relationship between Roarke and Dallas, complete with ups and downs, or the mystery of solving the murders. The relationship area kept me guessing a bit more than the identity of the villain.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this book is the introduction of Officer Peabody, Dallas' new partner. Peabody is trying to earn her detective shield and is the perfect combination in both police work and social events for Dallas. Throw into the mix the colorful friends support cast that evolve around Eve Dallas, e.g. Dr. Mira, Mavis, Leonardo, etc., and you have a very fun, exciting book with few dull moments.<br /><br />I love the small touches Robb adds that give the reader a chance to smile and wonder if that's really what's in store for us. I'd love to have an AutoChef that you program to cook whatever meal or snack you desire, or a car that can travel on both the road and in the air. My personal favorite is the drying tube that Eve Dallas uses after her showers instead of a towel (and did I mention that everything is voice controlled - like turning on the shower to the exact temperature that you prefer?). Ah, life does sound good in 2058!<br /><br />Diehard mystery buffs won't have a problem guessing the person behind the mayhem, but even so this book is still a great adventure. The main thing is to be sure to read the books in order - there is a lot of history that is built as you go, so don't jump ahead in the series!ce controlled - like turning on the shower to the exact temperature that you prefer?).

It wasn't as predictable (even though you could figure out the ending) and held a few twists and turns that caught the reader off guard.<br /><br />Megan O'Malley is the first female field agent with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in the Minneapolis area. She's assigned to a post in Deer Lake, Minnesota - a small, quiet community that is rocked by a kidnapping on Megan's first day on the job. An eight-year-old boy, Josh Kirkwood, vanishes off the sidewalk in broad daylight without any witnesses. Could it be more dastardly than that? Oh yes!<br /><br />Dr. Garrison, chief of ER, is late leaving the hospital when an accident victim needs her immediate attention. She has a co-worker place a call to the local hockey arena to let her young son know she's running late. When she does get to the arena, there's no sign of Josh. He has just disappeared.<br /><br />Mitch Holt is the local police chief who has a hard time with this crime because it brings up the devastating past he's tried to bury. He's friends with Josh's parents, Dr. Hannah Garrison and Paul Kirkwood, which makes the crime hit all too close to home. He tries his best, and Megan O'Malley is there to spur him along when the painful memories blur his responsibilities as the police chief.<br /><br />As the reader continues with the story, you can feel the emotions brought forth by the searchers, the volunteers, the local residents and even Josh's family. You feel their hurt, outrage and confusion. That's what Tami Hoag does best - lets the reader feel the story. I found myself angry with Paul Kirkwood for his secret and his wrath towards his wife - always blaming her for the disappearance of their son, even though she was trying to save a life while this was happening, and he was with his mistress. I found myself cheering for Megan as she battled one opponent after another. And I found myself rooting that Megan and Mitch's attraction would not fall by the side of the road. But most of all, I found myself rooting that they would find Josh before it was too late.<br /><br />It's an interesting story, but somewhat depressing at times. It seems that the secret lives of many in this small town are sad and dismal - from the priest who is attracted to Dr. Garrison and feels guilty about that attraction to a religious fanatic who has his own hidden secrets to the local media who will do anything to get an exclusive interview.<br /><br />Even though I enjoyed the first part of this story (it's continued in Hoag's book Guilty as Sin), I don't plan on reading the second part for a while. While reading Night Sins I found myself depressed and wondering if anyone in this small town had a normal, happy life.<br /><br />As one reviewer said \\"the leads all have sordid pasts\\" and it seems as if the only happy, innocent person in the story is abducted. This is one nightmare I don't wish to continue for a couple of months - even though I enjoyed it and definitely want to read the next book! Ok, so maybe I'm a wimp!<br /><br />Tami Hoag does an excellent job in character development and in setting the scene.

Jance since I met her in a bookstore browsing through the mystery section. She convinced me to try one of her books, which I did, and loved it. She had also told me that she would soon start a new series - that was many years ago and I've been enthralled with each new book since the Joanna Brady series began. These books usually leave you turning pages as fast as you can read, but this one wasn't quite that captivating. Don't get me wrong, it was still very good, just not the excellence I've come to expect from Jance's writing.<br /><br />This is the ninth novel featuring Joanna Brady, a tough Arizona sheriff who enchants her way into the reader's hearts. In the last novel, Devil's Claw we leave Joanna as she's honeymooning with her new husband Butch, after having her home destroyed by a maniac. Paradise Lost picks up shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Joanna is once again caught in the struggle to maintain balance between being sheriff, being a new wife, and being a mother to a 12-year-old. While Joanna and Butch are at a sheriff's conference across the state, Joanna's daughter, Jenny, goes on a Girl Scout campout. Jenny and another girl, Dora Matthews, sneak off after lights out only to find trouble in a big way. They stumble across a dead body. Because the girls were breaking rules, they are sent back to Bisbee while the sheriff's department investigates this murder in Apache Pass.<br /><br />When Dora Matthews, turns up dead the next day, Joanna is worried about Jenny's safety and the balance between the various hats she wears comes tumbling down around her. Added to this second murder, is a third murder - the body of the prime suspect in the first murder turns up. Three deaths in a matter of four days are more than Bisbee has ever seen and it's up to Joanna to help solve them.<br /><br />The end of Paradise Lost is predictable and not one of the better suspenseful conclusions that Jance has created in the past. J.A. Jance has always tied up the loose ends, but this time she leaves one flapping in the gentle Arizona breeze. The subplot involving a series of carjackings is never fully developed and leaves much to be desired by the reader. She eludes to this subplot several times, but there is no meat to it and nothing ever comes of it - no tie in to the murders, no interesting side journey, just a passing mention every once in a while.<br /><br />And a low point in this book was Joanna's wavering attitude towards her overbearing mother, Eleanor. She finds neutral ground and \\"understands\\" her mother. I didn't buy it - it was too passe for me. Joanna wouldn't buy into the poor, poor me bit, the martyrdom, that her mother is excellent at portraying. But this time she does and it is very anti-climatic - I wanted a good, old fashioned tongue lashing that we've come to expect when these two clash.<br /><br />The one thing that is decided in this book is Joanna Brady will run for reelection as Cochise County Sheriff. I'm sure the next book in this series will encompass the campaigning and how it affects Butch and Jenny.

US	51874804	R496R7WYTDNHS	0425172546	361016626	Southern Cross (Andy Brazil)	Books	1	7	9	N	N	List After List After List...	Since I hadn't enjoyed Hornet's Next, I had high hopes that Patricia Cornwell would gain momentum with Southern Cross and it would be comparable to her Kay Scarpetta books. I was very disappointed but do admit that it was better than Hornet's Next (but then again, that's not saying much in my opinion).<br /><br />List #1 - Main Characters<br /><br />Once again we're drug into the lives of Judy Hammer, now the Police Chief in Richmond, Virginia; Deputy Virginia West; and Deputy Andy Brazil. Why Cornwell insists on three main characters instead of focusing on one and weaving the other two into it is still a puzzle. Scarpetta is the main character in the other series but Lucy, Benton and Marino have shared the spotlight. With Hammer, Brazil and West it seems as if Cornwell has to divide the book up between these characters and not just show their interactions with the main and sub plots but with normal everyday activities, like Hammer walking her dog or West arguing with her cat. Huh, who cares?<br /><br />List #2 - Plots and Subplots<br /><br />Most books have one main plot and several sub plots, but not this one. Instead there are several plots period. Plot #1 is the growing gang problem where the reader is introduced to Smoke and his buddies and their attempt to seduce a younger kid, Weed, into the Pike gang. Another plot is Smoke's serial ATM robberies that only tie in towards the end of the book with a very weak thread. Another plot is the computer hacker who brings the police department's sophisticated system to a halt with little blue fish. Yet another plot is Bubba, the brain deficient, paranoid tobacco plant worker and his collection of guns and tools.<br /><br />What Cornwell did not do was to tie these plots together in a smooth, cohesive manner. Instead the reader is taken on a bumpy journey that bounces from plot to plot and character to character with no clear course in mind. Not until the last few pages does she tie them together and it's a ragged outcome.<br /><br />List #3 - Support Characters' Roles<br /><br />Usually support characters have some reason for being in the story. Not true in this tale. Cornwell seems to have comprised yet another list with little need for all of these people to even be involved in the story. Even though some of these characters are funny or just plain bizarre, they aren't involved in the plots to the extent that we need to know everything that goes on in their lives.<br /><br />One example can be Bubba and Smudge, good buddies who work and hunt together. There are several interactions (coon hunting, break at work, etc.) that just plain leaves the reader wondering why these were included at all. They have very little to do with any of the plots and although the diner scene and coon hunting trip were actually very funny, they could have been deleted altogether and the book would survived.<br /><br />List #4 - Endless Characters With No Need to Be<br /><br />I didn't go through and count all the characters mentioned in this book but my guess would have to be that there are well over a hundred of them. And Cornwell goes into detail about each of them. Again, why and who cares?<br /><br />I finished this book a few of weeks ago and my subconscious has tried to push any recollection out of my head. Let me put my memory to work and list a few of the minor players for you. These are in no particular order, just random memory glimpses:<br /><br />Patty Passman, the police dispatcher, who can't get away from the radio fast enough to put money in the parking meter and gets not only a parking ticket but gets arrested for a long list of offenses.<br /><br />Pigeon - a homeless man who has a moldy face, sunken eyes, smells horrible and hangs out in crowds.<br /><br />Smudge - the so-called friend of Bubba who has found an easy mark in his pal and takes advantage of it at every opportunity!<br /><br />Lelia Ehrhart - the socialite who is involved with every major committee in Richmond so she doesn't have to deal with a philandering husband. Lelia also can't put a sentence together in correct English to save her life. In fact it got to be so bad, that several of her dialogs had to be reread several times before I could partially understand what was trying to be said. Example: \\"It disdains me that people from your generation respect not a thing that's gone before in the past. And the point is, it isn't gone even if it started before you in. I'm standing here, as evident.\\" NOTE: There are no typographical errors in that passage. It is exactly as written in the book! I must stress that if you read the previous dialog, you would still have no clue as to what she's trying to say!<br /><br />Muskrat - the local auto body/repair owner who can fix anything and everything.

US	51874804	ROQ1FLEDMRHGH	042517140X	776192522	Loyalty in Death	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Too Similar to the WTC Bombings	With the events of September 11th still so vivid in my mind, I didn't think about reading the synopsis on the back book cover of Loyalty in Death by J.D. Robb. To be honest, if I had read the back, I probably would not have read this book right now and waited a few weeks to continue my journey through the In Death series. It was tough to read this one when the wounds from September 11th were still so raw but I did enjoy the story even if some of the similarities were a bit creepy!<br /><br />The In Death futuristic series continues with several excellent subplots surrounding and interweaving into a suspenseful main plot. A terrorist group, Cassandra, an offshoot of a former previously disbanded anti-government group, has targeted New York historical landmarks to bomb unless their demands are met. Cassandra tips off homicide detective, Eve Dallas, and makes a sick game out of these acts of terrorism - who will win and at what cost?<br /><br />The first building blown up just happens to be one owned by Eve's multi-billionaire husband, Roarke, and so the game becomes personal. It's a race against the clock to find the planted bombs, stop death and destruction, while trying to figure out the identities of the villains.<br /><br />Now if the main plot wasn't enough to keep the reader amused and entertained, Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) has given us a couple of subplots that are fantastic. In the last two books in the In Death series, two of Eve's assistants have been flirting and skirting a romantic liaison. I've read each one wondering just when the flamboyant Ian McNabb, EDD detective (Electronic Device Division), and the \\"everything by the book\\" Officer Delia Peabody (Eve's right hand woman) would get together. Well this is the book that begins the relationship - and hot doesn't even begin to describe it. Who doesn't smile when they go at each other in an elevator that just happens to be stopped between floors (hey, McNabb can program anything!). But it's not enough to get each other out of their systems, so they then continue the interlude in his apartment. Ah yes, the anticipated fireworks will not leave the reader disappointed, and J.D. Robb hints that it's only a taste of what the future holds. And I absolutely love it when McNabb calls her \\"She-body\\" and she jumps down his throat - ah yes, it's true love!<br /><br />We are also introduced to one of Peabody's Free-age family members when her brother Zeke comes to New York City on a working vacation from Arizona. Zeke is the baby brother and Peabody is the protective big sister, but she can't keep him from being drawn into a murder investigation as the prime suspect. Given the fact that when the murder occurred, she was a little busy with McNabb, she feels plenty of guilt about the entire situation. Yes, this is a very interesting side journey.<br /><br />Overall the book is very good, even if the villain behind Cassandra is predictable. It once again showcases J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts' ability to weave a tale of mystery, develop characters that audiences love, and even throw in a bit of humor. Her all around talent is remarkable and this series proves it!gh to get each other out of their systems, so they then continue the interlude in his apartment.

This series follows the lives of three childhood friends, each very different from the others - different ideals and different backgrounds. The common tie is that they were all raised in the same mansion near Monterey, California.<br /><br />Finding the Dream focuses on Laura Templeton, daughter of a wealthy hotel magnate. Laura has grown up in a life of luxury, having any and all amenities available to her. Her dreams have always been simple - she wants a happy marriage and happy, healthy children. When she turns 18, she thinks her dreams are soon to be fulfilled when Peter, an assistant manager at one of her father's hotels, proposes. The bliss is short-lived when Peter's true colors emerge - all he wants is a boost in his career. He doesn't really want a wife and children and feels they're only something that must be endured to reach his ultimate goal of taking over the Templeton empire.<br /><br />Laura struggles to make things work until she finds out that Peter is lying, cheating on her and stealing from her father's company.<br /><br />Finding herself divorced and having the sole responsibility of raising her two children, life is far from the dreams Laura once envisioned. She refuses to be taken care of by her parents and insists on supporting herself and trying to survive the struggles of a single parent.<br /><br />Enter Michel Fury, a friend of Josh, Laura's brother and husband to Margo, Laura's friend. Michael rents a home with stables on the Templeton estate and meets Laura. Ahh ... romance ensues, but if you think it will be a typical romantic story line, you're mistaken. Nora Roberts throws several other aspects into the mix. She shows Michael's struggles to win over and have a loving relationship with Laura's daughters. She shows Peter trying to wheedle his way back into Laura's life through the girls, but only for the purpose of blackmail. Roberts continues with the side mystery of the golden \\"magical\\" coins we've seen in the first two books in this trilogy. The story of the coins states that true love and happiness will be in the finder's future and lore has them lost on the cliffs near Templeton House. The story behind these coins is wonderful itself!<br /><br />I have to say that one of my favorite parts of this book is when Michael decks Peter. Nora Roberts shows her sense of humor in letting Peter get what's truly coming to him.<br /><br />This trilogy was the first Nora Roberts books I read and they made me a die-hard fan. One reviewer summed everything up by saying, \\"Nora Roberts's writing is the dream!\\" I can't argue with that!continues with the side mystery of the golden \\"magical\\" coins we've seen in the first two books in this trilogy.

I wasn't sure I'd like a \\"futuristic\\" type novel, even though the alter ego of one of my favorite authors, Nora Roberts, was writing it. Writing as J.D. Robb, she has definitely changed my mind about this genre. Naked in Death was impossible for me to put down until the last page was read!<br /><br />J.D. Robb introduces us to Eve Dallas, a tough New York police lieutenant who has always relied on herself in all situations and has never let anyone get close to her personally. Eve Dallas is one of the best homicide detectives that New York Security and Police Department (NYSPD) has to offer - she's smart, gutsy, and holds nothing back when trying to solve a case.<br /><br />In this first book of the series, a ruthless serial killer is murdering licensed companions (the term used for prostitutes in the year 2058). It's Dallas' job to find the murderer and stop him/her before another killing. Oh what a tangled web the reader is tangled in with a variety of characters that are so vivid you actually feel as if you know them personally.<br /><br />Roarke, a multi-billionaire, is of Irish decent, drop dead gorgeous, smart and just the right combination of charisma and attitude to attract Dallas. Even when the first murder victim links Roarke as a possible suspect.<br /><br />The colorful support cast will have you smiling and shaking your head. They range from the talented lounge singer who has become Dallas' best friend, to the obnoxious senator who rules the senate and his family with an iron fist, to Dallas' partner who reminds me of a Basset Hound with droopy eyes and a penchant for sugared almonds. Ah yes, they are quite a bunch of characters, full of antics that will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />As Dallas is trying to solve these crimes, she falls in love with Roarke. She hopes she can prove his innocence, but knows that if he is the murderer her job always comes first and she would have to arrest him even while her heart is breaking. Sound like she's a sap? No way! She's never been in love before, so not only is it a new experience, it's also an emotion that has her confused and at times irritable. Even experiencing the sentiment for the first time, she's still tough as nails.<br /><br />The book has a great combination of romance, mystery and even science fiction. I love the AutoChef that cooks up meals at the touch of a finger and the automobiles that are able to go from road to sky at the flip of a switch. How about the airbuses that cruise through the city skies full of tourists? And guns have been outlawed so police use stunners that have various settings from a mild shock to the \\"termination\\" setting.<br /><br />Ok, sounds strange, but it is absolutely wonderful. J.D. Robb, AKA Nora Roberts, is the best when it comes to blending the genres and you won't be disappointed with this series. I highly suggest this book if you love mystery, intrigue and romance. I'd also strongly recommend that you have a copy of Glory in Death on hand so you can finish this book and pick up the next in the series. You'll be hooked!ike she's a sap? No way!

Jance years ago in a bookstore in Palm Desert, California, she had told me she was in the process of creating a new series, which came to be known as the Sheriff Joanna Brady series. She had felt she needed a break from her J.P. Beaumont detective series. Over a decade later, she has the two characters meet in her latest novel, Partner in Crime.<br /><br />Partner in Crime is set in Bisbee, Arizona, the home of Sheriff Joanna Brady. A newcomer to town, Rochelle Baxter, is getting ready to have her first ever art exhibit. Unfortunately, the day before the show Rochelle is poisoned with a chemical known as sodium azide. This compound has no taste, no smell, is hard to trace, and is readily available (sounds like the perfect murder weapon to me!). And so, the hunt for the killer begins. But when the next of kin notifications are taking place, Sheriff Brady discovers that Rochelle Baxter is really Latisha Wall, a lady placed in Bisbee by the Washington State Attorney General's office's witness protection program. And the tale twists into a mystery involving two states, two law enforcement officers used to being in charge, and two very strong personalities.<br /><br />Sheriff Brady has her hands full trying to find the killer, when J.P. Beaumont arrives in town to \\"observe the investigation\\". Seems Beau is now with the Washington State's S.H.I.T. (Special Homicide Investigative Team) and since their witness is now dead, they feel a need to see who really killed her.<br /><br />Sheriff Brady is not too happy having a \\"watch dog\\" at her heels while she and her detectives are trying to solve this crime. Not only does she have to deal with Beau, but she also has to handle the never ending problems that go with being a sheriff: budget cuts, Marliss Shackleford (the annoying newspaper columnist who has a grudge against her), balancing work and home, among other things.<br /><br />I have to admit the joining of these two characters was a bit confusing. Only a handful of supporting characters originated in Seattle with the majority of them hailing from Bisbee. It was almost like urbanite Beaumont was tossed into the middle of the wild, wild west complete with a chase on horseback! A bit on the strange side for Jance, but nevertheless, it was still enjoyable.<br /><br />We're again given glimpses into the lives of Jenny (Joanna's daughter), Butch (Joanna's husband), Frank Montoya, Jaime Carbajal, and a few others typically in the Brady series-supporting cast. We're given a very brief glimpse into Beau's life, with a few pages on new love interest, Naomi Pepper and on his working relationship with his supervisor, Harry I. Ball (now that was funny!). But to me, it was completely unnecessary unless Jance is planning something in the future and is laying the groundwork for the next book. The focus could have centered on Bisbee and the characters there with only mentions of the Seattle crew.<br /><br />The story line was great and the character development was her usual standard of excellence. The hardest part while reading was the switching back and forth of writing style. Jance wrote the Beaumont series in a first person writing style, while the Brady series is in the third person style. So which did she choose for Partner in Crime? She combined them, thus switching back and forth depending on which character she was currently focusing. This sometimes resulted in a shaking of the head to keep from jumping the track.<br /><br />The part of the book that made me really think was the Author's Note in the back of the book. Jance tells her reading audience that she first heard about sodium azide while reading her alumni magazine from the University of Arizona. It seems this deadly chemical is readily available and the public is unaware of the potential hazards. Sodium azide is used to inflate air bags found in vehicles from about 1995 on. Once it ignites an air bag, the substance becomes \\"a harmless nitrogen based gas.\\" However, how many vehicles are in junkyards with air bags still intact and these canisters with a deadly compound sitting right there? And no one regulates this chemical and anyone can obtain it easily. Now that's a scary thought! Maybe a letter to your legislative representatives is in order, before murders are committed using this lethal compound. At least that's the suggestion of Jance.<br /><br />Thanks for reading; I'm off to write my congressman...harmless nitrogen based gas.\\" However, how many vehicles are in junkyards with air bags still intact and these canisters with a deadly compound sitting right there?

Nora Roberts takes you on a tour of a small village in Ireland, as seen through the eyes of Jude, a Yank in a foreign, unfamiliar country.  One of the things Roberts does best is to involve her readers throughout the story.  Her flowing descriptions allow the reader to envision the cottage on the hill, to smell the flowers in bloom, to observe the lush green countryside of Ireland.<br /><br />We are then introduced to Aidan - a tall, dark, handsome Irishman full of romantic ideals but unable to verbalize his love.  Could he be too good to be true?  Nope, he has his faults just like all the Irish hunks!  But those faults are few and far between, which often overlooked by Jude who seems to keep Aidan grounded, while he allows her to gain her wings and enjoy life.<br /><br />Nora Roberts intertwines Irish myth and legend throughout the story comparing Jude to Lady Gwen (ghost of Faerie Hill Cottage who waits for her true love to confess his adoration). Aidan is compared to Carrick (Prince of Faeries who is willing to give Lady Gwen jewels of the sun, gems of the moon, and the heart of the sea, but is unable to confess his love for her in words).  This is the 300-year-old legend that has the reader cheering for Lady Gwen/Jude and Aidan/Carrick to grasp onto true love and shout it from the cliffs.<br /><br />Nora Roberts is excellent at threading the Irish traditions into the flavor of the story.  We're left wondering if it really is Irish lore or is it the imagination of one of America's best-loved authors.  If you're a true romantic at heart, this book would definitely be enjoyable.	2005-03-21

Instead Cornwell takes us on a journey to meet the police department of Charlotte, North Carolina. This police station is also known as the \\"Hornet's Nest of America\\".<br /><br />This was a decent tale, but it's definitely not up to par with the expectations we have with most Cornwell books. The thing that struck me as most odd was that none of the characters are as dynamic as those in her other books - they lack that sparkling personality, or obnoxious mouth, etc. Just very bland people running around doing normal police stuff. (Ok, so that may be stretching it a bit, but that's how I felt.)  The characters were blah which is definitely not in keeping with Cornwell's usual character development.<br /><br />Hornets Nest also differs from her normal style of writing.  This book leaves a lot to be desired by those who read and enjoy her, but is still a fair story. I had hoped it was a diversion and then she would go back to her Scarpetta series, stronger than ever. Unfortunately she's written two sequels to this book and they get worse as she continues.<br /><br />Not a great suspenseful drama, but it is semi-enjoyable. Just be aware that it's not her normal edge-of-your seat suspense otherwise you may be disappointed!  Grab it if all other books are unavailable.	2005-03-21

I've often referred to the small romance books as \\"throw away\\" books because you can usually finish them in a couple of hours.  Nightshade is a Silhouette Intimate Moments Book and definitely a quick read.  It's also the 3rd book in Nora Roberts Night Series (the other two are also the short romance type of books).  The entire series could be completed in less than a weekend of reading if you're trapped indoors with nothing else to do.<br /><br />As with many of Nora Roberts' early books, the plot line is somewhat predictable, but still very enjoyable. It's the basic cookie-cutter romance plot:  man meets woman (they are total opposites), sparks fly, romance ensues, and they live happily-ever-after.  But one of Nora Roberts' best writing traits is her ability to develop characters so the reader feels they are real.<br /><br />Colt Nightshade is a private detective looking for a runaway teenager being held against her will. In the course of his investigations, he becomes the unwilling partner of police Lt. Althea Grayson. This case hits Grayson a little too close to home for her to be completely objective.  Thus the struggles of the main female character - she struggles with the case and with the attraction to Nightshade.<br /><br />Colt Nightshade is the typical romantic male lead - handsome, debonair, and a bit intriguing with his bad-boy tendencies by not playing \\"by the book\\" to solve the case or win the affections of Althea.<br /><br />While this dynamic duo are trying to sort out their feelings for each other, they are hot on the trail of the bad guys.  Ok, didn't I mention \\"cookie cutter\\" romance above in my description???  Yep, and it even has a happily-ever-after ending too (bet you didn't see that coming!).<br /><br />This book is typical and predictable but still an enjoyable read (as with most of Roberts' books)!  The original Silhouette Intimate Moments book is out of print and is considered VERY HARD TO FIND but reprints are available!/>	2005-03-21

With that being said, it's not a wonder that I snatched up The Villa when it hit the bookstores, as I always anxiously await a new arrival from Nora Roberts. The book is a bit of a departure from the normal Nora Roberts writing style, but still has strong character descriptions, a great story line and she illustrates the setting in such a manner that the reader can close his/her eyes and the mental picture is awesome and vivid.<br /><br />In the past, if the setting wasn't on American soil, Nora Roberts usually portrayed Ireland or even Scotland. The Villa is set mostly in the Napa Valley but she takes the reader on a few trips to the wine country of Italy also. As with most of her books, if you're not careful you may learn a thing or two, as I did about the wine making process.<br /><br />The Giambellis have been an international wine making dynasty for over 100 years with vineyards in both Italy and the US. The MacMillan vineyards are a much younger company and specialize in domestic wines. We're introduced to \\"La Signora\\", Tereza Giambelli, who is the strong matriarch of the Giambelli Family and runs both the family and the business with a strong, capable presence. She and her husband of 25 years, Eli MacMillan, decide to merge their two family owned companies thus causing some interesting friction between their grandchildren, Sophia Giambelli and Tyler MacMillan who scramble to find their rightful place in the family businesses.<br /><br />Thrown into this mix is the new Chief Operating Officer, David Cutter, whom La Signora entices away from one of Giambelli's primary competitors. David is instantly attracted to Pilar Giambelli, the daughter of Tereza and mother of Sophia. Ok, so this is starting to get complicated, so let me give you a list of players...<br /><br />La Signora, Tereza Giambelli - head of the Giambelli family and of Giambelli Vineyards in both Napa and Italy.<br /><br />Eli MacMillan - second husband of Tereza Giambelli and head of MacMillan Vineyards in Napa.<br /><br />Pilar Giambelli - Tereza's daughter, estranged wife of Tony Avano, mother of Sophia Giambelli. She spends her time in the greenhouse and leaves the family wine business to others.<br /><br />Sophia Giambelli - granddaughter of Tereza, daughter of Pilar and Tony. She is being groomed to take over control of the Giambelli Empire. Sophia is the media/advertising guru of Giambelli and a whirlwind of energy.<br /><br />Tyler MacMillan - grandson of Eli MacMillan and the man in charge of MacMillan vineyards. He too is being groomed to take over the family business yet is the polar opposite of Sophia.

She grabs the reader within the first few pages and takes you on a fun ride through the lives of three different people who have common threads. No one writes a better trilogy than Nora Roberts does!<br /><br />Dance Upon the Air introduces us to the legend of Three Sisters Island. To escape being persecuted during the Salem Witch-Hunts, three witches (Air, Wind and Earth) use their magic to have part of the land break off and become an island haven where they can be safe and free. Each goes a different way, and the story is of their offspring finding their way back to the island.<br /><br />Dance Upon the Air focuses on Air, as you can probably tell by the title. Air's descendent is Nell Channing, a woman who fakes her own death to leave an abusive, wealthy husband. After her death, she changes her identity and becomes Nell. Nell has been running for almost a year when she comes to Three Sisters Island and finally finds a place she wants to call home. She takes a job in the Book Caf&eacute; working for Mia Devlin, a powerful witch with past demons of her own. The two become fast friends. When Nell realizes she too has powers, Mia becomes her mentor and her life really changes from anything she's ever experienced.<br /><br />This would be a fun book with whimsical stories of friends helping each other heal their wounds, but Ms. Roberts has other ideas to add to the mix. Enter Zack Todd, the local hunky sheriff who starts pecking away at the wall Nell has built around her. Ah yes, a bit of romance to spice things up a bit! And to keep things just a little off balance, she adds Ripley Todd, Zack's sister and Three Sisters Island deputy. Ripley used to practice her witchcraft but for some reason she has given it up. Ms. Roberts doesn't enlighten us as to the reason, only lets us enjoy the tough, opinionated, obstinate Rip, as she's known. The interchanges between Ripley and Mia are filled with fireworks, animosity and tons of other emotions that add pure enjoyment to your reading.<br /><br />Dance Upon the Air is somewhat predictable but when you're engrossed in it, you really won't care about that fact. It's an interesting, romantic tale of how a young woman is able to leave a miserable life and strike out on her own and become happy. It's a story of friendship and the power of those types of bonds. It's a romance that will have you sigh. It's definitely worth the price of a new paperback!<br /><br />Heaven and Earth is the next in this trilogy - see my review on that one!on she has given it up.

To me it seemed as if J.D. Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) rushed this book. Maybe that was the desired effect - to have everyone rushing around because it was the Christmas holidays and fast was the appropriate speed. Planned or not, it wasn't as appealing as the other books.<br /><br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas is once again faced with a serial killer and since it's Christmas time, the madman dresses as Santa Claus to torture, rape and strangle his victims. The security cameras show Santa walking into each prey's apartment dressed in a red suit, complete with white hair and beard. His calling card for each victim is a piece of jewelry depicting one of the 12 Christmas gifts (you know Partridge in a Pear Tree, French Hens, Turtle Doves...). Eve has to stop him and fast (again with the speed).<br /><br />The reader was only given a glimpse of the villain, so it was almost impossible to figure out the identity. The story line was laid out, but not as well defined as in her previous works. And the ending was a race to the last page. So much more could have been defined. So much more could have been explored. So much more was needed... I finished the book and felt let down. I wanted to know more - I wanted to learn about Christmas with Eve and Roarke. I wanted to see how Delia Peabody faired Christmas Day (can't say more or I'll give away part of the story). And more importantly, did Ian McNab visit Peabody on Christmas to check up on her? What was Roarke's reaction to Eve's special Christmas present for him (since so much time was spent describing this purchase!)? What did Roarke give Eve for Christmas? So many questions with no answers. An epilogue was definitely needed!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Holiday in Death was still a good book - ok, so it was a decent read, not great, but decent. I've just come to expect more with Nora Roberts / J.D. Robb that it was a disappointment. I expect those loose ends to be tied up in a nice, neat package. Since it's imperative that these books be read in order, I had to get through this once before I can read Conspiracy in Death the next one on the list.<br /><br />So muddle through it without much expectation and move on. That's my advice on this one!. I expect those loose ends to be tied up in a nice, neat package.

Ceremony in Death has new murders for Lieutenant Eve Dallas to solve and these take the reader on a journey into a different realm than we've seen in the previous books. With J.D. Robb at the helm, we should expect the unexpected!<br /><br />A fellow officer is found dead in his living room and the coroner's preliminary report determines that his heart gave out. This doesn't sit well with Eve Dallas as she suspects foul play. This feeling of unease goes into high gear when she's asked to investigate whether he was a dirty cop, and she begins to smell a set up. This investigation also pits her against her mentor and good friend, Feeney.<br /><br />As Dallas begins to wonder about her own beliefs when she's thrown into the midst of a satanic cult whose high priestess is just plain evil. Then to add to the mix, a Wiccan high priestess is introduced - a woman who enjoys torturing others and believing she's been personally chosen to do the work of Satan. There isn't a dull moment in this investigation and when it turns personal towards Eve Dallas, Roarke is just a bit peeved.<br /><br />Some of the fun of this book (yes, with J.D. Robb writing, there is always a bit of fun in each book!), we learn more about Eve's sidekick, Officer Delia Peabody. The straight and narrow patrol officer wasn't always so regimented. We learn that her parents are Freeagers and that was the influence in her upbringing. Freeagers - hmm, well, I guess my best description would be hippie throwbacks without the drugs. Freeagers are vegans and believers of peace to all creatures. It's interesting to see the influence this has on Peabody and it often takes Dallas by surprise.<br /><br />As for the villain behind the three murders, any mystery fanatic can figure it out two thirds of the way into the book. Even so, this still makes for a great thriller and the colorful descriptions and witty dialog keep the reader entertained until the last page is turned.<br /><br />As with the previous books in the \\"In Death\\" series, this is a strong plot, has fantastic character development, and takes you on a wonderful journey. You won't be disappointed when you get to this book in the series. After reading Ceremony in Death, you'll make getting the next book a high priority!page is turned.  <br /> <br />As with the previous books in the \\"In Death\\" series, this is a strong plot, has fantastic character development, and takes you on a wonderful journey.

US	51874804	R131PWDV587KER	0316969680	540414996	The Beach House	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The End Justifies the Means?	What is going on with best-selling authors recently?  My theory is this - they plug away at their computers writing a decent tale and the editor/publisher calls saying the book must be finished by tomorrow.  So said author looks at his/her 300+ pages and throws in an ending.  Any ending will do.  It doesn't matter that the last 50 pages aren't consistent with the rest of the book, hey it's completed and turned in for publication as requested!<br /><br />That's the only viable conclusion I have for the way The Beach House ended (plus All The Queen's Men by Linda Howard and 2nd Chance again by James Patterson).  Or maybe the author sends the manuscript in unfinished and someone at the publishing company finishes it for them ... ok, maybe not, but something is going on!<br /><br />James Patterson and Peter DeJonge team up to write The Beach House, which starts off with murder in the Hamptons.  Everyone in Montauk likes Peter Mullen even if he is a bit of a flake.  He's hired to park cars at the annual Memorial Weekend party at the home of one of the richest men in the area, Barry Neubauer.  The next morning, Peter is found dead on the beach.  The cover-up begins as the local authorities say it was either an accident or suicide.  Peter's brother, Jack, a law student currently working as a summer intern for a prestigious New York law firm, doesn't buy the story and sets out seeking justice.<br /><br />Jack starts digging to find out why his brother was beaten to death and uncovers secrets the rich and famous want to keep hush-hush.  When Jack and his friends are threatened, he knows he's getting closer to the truth.<br /><br />Ok, so this story line has been done before, but Patterson and DeJonge do a fair job with it.  The character development is standard Patterson excellence and the reader can't help but wish they had a grandfather just like Macklin Mullen.  Mack's feisty, says what's on his mind, and is full life.  Then you have Dana Neubauer, the spoiled daughter of multi-billionaire Barry and old money Campion Neubauer.  Dana is Jack's girlfriend until she decides to side with daddy's money and turns her back on Jack and his quest.  A corrupt, yes-man type police detective, Frank Volpi, keeps things interesting with his attempts to get Jack Mullen to stop digging into a case he's closed. And of course you have a beautiful, gutsy private investigator named Pauline Grabowski, who lets Jack figure out she's really what he wants not Dana.  The cast of characters is vast and equally intriguing with each being very diverse, which in my opinion is what takes this book from mediocre to average.<br /><br />This paragraph gives specific details about the book and outcomes.  If you plan on reading this book, do not read this paragraph There were some major loose ends to which Patterson and DeJonge didn't give answers.  If Peter was HIV positive, as was Barry Neubauer, and since Barry, Dana and Peter \\"enjoyed\\" each other ... shouldn't Jack be tested for HIV since he and Dana were together?  And also Pauline?  It seemed as if the HIV slant was random - if Barry was HIV positive then the story could end with justice being doled out in that manner.  And why did Jack not pursue Dana in his quest for justice once he found out about the threesomes that were going on and instead took the \\"poor, abused Dana\\" bit - to me that was lame.  If Jack were going to pursue revenge, then Dana would also be a prime candidate.  And the father dying of a heart attack shortly after the death of Peter didn't add much to the story, so why bring him in at all?  So many questions to which the reader has no answers!<br /><br />Publishers Weekly summed it up perfectly, \\"Smooth as a vanilla milk shake and no more sophisticated, written in 113 short chapters that won't tax anyone's attention span, this is smart, market-savvy, populist entertainment.\\"  It's entertaining until the end at least!daughter of multi-billionaire Barry and old money Campion Neubauer.

Like Grafton's A, B, C's	There's just something about these books that leaves me wondering if I like the story once I've finished.  For several days after I finished 1st to Die, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not.  So I was hoping it would be definitive with 2nd Chance, but again I was left without a clear decision.<br /><br />2nd Chance continues with the premise of the Women's Murder Club consisting of four very intelligent friends who help solve high profile murder investigations.  The \\"Club\\" consists of Lindsay Boxer (the main character and focus of the book) who is a homicide detective with San Francisco Police Department; a San Francisco Chronicle reporter, Cindy Thomas, who once again gives the \\"Club\\" the big break it needs; Assistant District Attorney Jill Bernhardt, who has a very minor role; and Medical Examiner Claire Washburn, who the reader learns more about in this tale.<br /><br />I do have to say that once again James Patterson grabs the reader from the beginning, when a lone gunman begins shooting at a church where the children's choir has just finished rehearsing.  An eleven-year-old little girl is killed and the community is in an uproar over this hate crime.  Something just doesn't seem right to Boxer, so she convenes the Murder Club to get other opinions.<br /><br />Cindy Thomas links this killing with that of an elderly African American woman who lives across the Bay and the hunt is on for villain, The Chimera (a racist hate group symbol of a two headed lion) dubbed so because this symbol was left at both crime scenes.  Another detail that can't be overlooked is that both victims were related to cops.<br /><br />And so the reader is weaved in and out of the lives of these women as they try to help solve the case.  This is where the development breaks down a bit - just enough to confuse the reader.  Lindsay's father, whom abandoned her when she was young, waltzes back into her life.  It's interesting but I had a lot of unanswered questions about the entire relationship - the biggest being how Lindsay just tried to pick up like he never left.  Another sub-plot was Cindy Thomas and her personal life with glimpses of her dating life.  I'm not sure why Patterson thought to have Cindy date the African American reverend since that story line was minimally developed - possibly for inclusion in the third book in this series?  It would have been interesting with more details.  We're given a bit more insight into Claire Washburn, especially when the killer goes after her and her family.  That was appealing and I look forward to more in the future with this character!  But the one individual given little development was Jill Bernhardt.  Jill finds out she's pregnant and is ecstatic, as are her friends and husband.  Then later on, the baby is miscarried.  I'm still wondering at the purpose of this event in the book because it had absolutely no bearing on the story line...<br /><br />Overall it was interesting and better than most currently on the market.  Publishers Weekly sums it up pretty well saying \\"The basic story line is vintage Patterson, i.e., a serial killer (here, one known as Chimera) goes on a calculated rampage until stopped by the good guys or in this case, gals.\\"  I only wish Patterson would stop leaving us hanging with so many loose threads that either unravel and we stop caring about them, or he should develop them into something viable with the plot!

Now You See Her was a bit strange for my taste. Don't take that statement wrong, I still enjoyed it, just not as well as some of her other ones! Howard excels at writing romantic thrillers and this one, no matter how bizarre, is still a great book to pick up for the hot days of summer.<br /><br />Paris Sweeney is an artist who sees dead people - not only that, she has other psychic abilities, like never having to wait for a red light while driving or always finding a parking space in front of her destination (oh to be that lucky!), which she brushes off as just being a bit weird.<br /><br />Her new psychic gifts have affected her painting styles and the vivid colors and dramatic scenes are completely opposite from her other works. She's a starving artist type, but still weary about showing her new pieces. She meets at the gallery that showcases her work to talk to a possible client interested in a custom portrait. When she walks in, Candra (the gallery owner) and her soon-to-be ex-husband, Richard, are in a tiff in the office. She's feeling uncomfortable and it only gets worse when a senator and his wife walk in. She feels instant repulsion and decides that they are definitely not the type she wants to take on as clients. As she starts to leave, sparks fly between her and Richard - inevitable and predictable, yes, but it's still fun!<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough turmoil in her life, Sweeney begins painting murder scenes before they happen and has no memory of working on the paintings. These are done while in a sleep mode, similar to sleepwalking. Sweeney's first gruesome painting is of a beloved hot-dog vendor. That was a struggle to accept, but she did come to terms with it since she only knew him in passing. And then again during the night she begins painting another murder scene. Can she and Richard figure out the identity of the victim before the crime happens? As you've probably guessed, she doesn't. When that victim is identified as Candra, the police see the paintings thanks to Kai's tip, and it makes Sweeney and Richard their prime suspects. The intricate workings of this \\"who dun it\\" leave a roadmap that clearly points to the villain. The ending is only made exciting when Sweeney confronts the killer all by herself.<br /><br />Now You See Her is not a roller coaster ride of sheer suspense, but instead a sensual story that keeps you intrigued throughout. As I've found with the other Linda Howard books I've read, she always includes a bit of humor along the way. In this story, it comes in the character of a boy-toy named Kai and the repertoire between Richard and Sweeney.<br /><br />The plot is good, character development is excellent (you even want to hate the Senator and his wife as much as Sweeney does!), and the book is packed with charm and captivation enough to enthrall you until the end. Even the predictable things have enough pizzazz to keep the reader from groaning!<br /><br />After reading Now You See Her I can see why this was Linda Howard's sixth book on the New York Times Bestseller's List.

I even have a copy of Under the Boardwalk (an anthology written by several authors) signed by Jillian Hunter and have been meaning to peruse it. Then one day, I picked up Mr. Perfect and started reading. Did I like the book? Let me put it this way, I finished it that weekend - my housework didn't get done, I was a couch potato, we ate take-out, the laundry piled up, and I read the entire time. Wow, was it good!<br /><br />What I liked most about this story was that Linda Howard made me burst out laughing at times. Her characters were very down to earth and believable, and I found myself cheering the spunkiness of Jaine Bright, the lead female in this tome.<br /><br />Jaine Bright and three friends/co-workers meet at a bar for drinks once a week to ponder life. The trouble begins one night, when they started joking around about what characteristics would make up \\"Mr. Perfect\\". A list is conceived for their future entertainment, including not only personality characteristics, but physical attributes as well (Oh My!). When the list is published by accident, getting national attention, it only adds fuel to a psychopath's belief that these women must be destroyed because they are making fun of him - after all, what kind of woman would describe physical attributes that he didn't possess?<br /><br />The first friend is killed and the other three feel it's just a terrible coincidence. But when the second friend is killed the day of the funeral, a sick feeling begins to envelope Jaine as she realizes that she too is in grave danger.<br /><br />Ok, so that is a bit much, and pretty basic for a plot line, but when you combine that with the sexy detective, Sam, who just happens to live next door to Jaine, then the really great story line comes into play!<br /><br />It seems that Sam was working undercover when Jaine first moved into her new house and Jaine thought her neighbor was a drunken bum. Since he was \\"stumbling\\" in when Jaine was leaving for work, she assumed the worst. But when her friend dies, she finds out that Sam is the only one who can protect her and find the identity of the killer.<br /><br />Yes, the story line seems a bit predictable but the witty conversations, fantastic sense of humor shown by Howard, and the character development make this book worthwhile!<br /><br />This is not your ordinary mystery, it's much more.

She leaves the reader anxious for the next installment in the series with her compelling stories of romance that leave you saying, \\"Ah...\\".  The Three Sisters Island Trilogy is no exception and is wonderful.  Since all three books are now in print, I suggest that you buy them at the same time so you don't have to wait until the next book is purchased.<br /><br />Nora Roberts has written several books dealing with witches as main characters (Donovan Series, being one of my favorites).  She doesn't show the characters to be the stereotypical ideals we've been led to believe, but shows them to be human beings that care, laugh and love like every other person around.  To put it mildly, she's made them \\"real\\".<br /><br />Heaven and Earth is the second book in the Three Sisters Island Trilogy and continues with the legacy passed down on the island.  This book features Ripley Todd, a witch who is trying hard to forget her powers because they make her uncomfortable.  She has a temper and is worried about losing it and using her powers in a harmful way, so she feels it's best to ignore those powers altogether.  She's grown up on the island and is now a deputy sheriff working with her brother.  She's gruff, no-nonsense, temperamental, and a bit on the hostile side.  She and Mia Devlin, the island's famous witch, used to be best friends, but a falling out has left them at odds with each other.  \\"At odds\\" is a mild term compared to some of their arguments!  And we're not told exactly what happened, just given tidbits to lead us to the next book, which holds the answers.<br /><br />When a paranormal researcher, Dr. MacAllister (Mac) Booke, comes to the island to see what all the talk is about, he's intrigued with the tough acting deputy.  His feelings run the standard romantic novel course from interested in her, to lusting after her, to falling head over heels in love with her.  When Mac sets up his equipment that detects paranormal activity, he thinks it's a malfunction when Ripley sets the machines buzzing to the point of frying one of them.  There begins the dilemma - does Mac love Ripley for herself or because she's a witch?<br /><br />You have the standard good versus evil bit and a final scene complete with lightning flashing, the skies storming, and the ocean waves beating the shore.  You have Ripley trying to stand alone against these forces to save the island.  Ok, so it has to be the three witches forming a circle to protect the island that they love, but Ripley still tries to do it on her own!<br /><br />Ripley is a fun character and I found myself smiling at many of her antics.  She is known for telling everyone exactly how she feels.  When she meets Mac and finds out about his profession her response is priceless and typical Ripley:  \\"I didn't know they gave out degrees for the study of crapola\\".  Ya gotta love Ripley!<br /><br />Heaven and Earth lets us have glimpses of Nell (the main character from Dance Upon Air, the first book in this series).  It also builds us up for the last book in the set, Face the Fire featuring Mia Devlin.  It's a perfect middle book and holds the reader's interest from start to finish, leaving him/her anticipating the next one.  Ah yes, not many can do a trilogy this well.<br /><br />This story would be a typical romance if not for the witch elements and history of the island thrown in the mix.  It's interesting and keeps most readers thrilled.  If you don't like a happily-ever-after type of book, then this isn't for you.that detects paranormal activity, he thinks it's a malfunction when Ripley sets the machines buzzing to the point of frying one of them.

I can't remember if I took a class or went to a seminar that delved into the aspects of mystery writing.  I do know that since then, very few in this genre fool me.  In that learning environment, I was taught exactly how most writers plan their stories and how the \\"villain\\" is hidden.  This knowledge has taken a bit away from the suspense of most books, but when one comes along that actually fools me, I usually cheer out loud.  A whoop of pleasure erupted from me when I got to the end of The Coffin Dancer.  It didn't fool me until the very end, but I was definitely on the wrong path and only figured it out right before Jeffrey Deaver let all of his reading audience in on the bad guy's identity.<br /><br />The Coffin Dancer is the second book in the Lincoln Rhyme series.  Lincoln is a quadriplegic forensic expert who retired when he was injured on the job and was unable to move any part of his body except his head and his ring finger.  He was talked out of retirement in The Bone Collector and continues to help corral criminals in this next book.<br /><br />Three murder witnesses are in grave danger when their testimony can put a millionaire arms dealer, Phillip Hansen, in jail for the rest of his life.  Edward Carney, co-owner of Hudson Air, a small charter airplane company, is killed when his airplane blows up midair.  The FBI comes in to protect the other two to ensure they are able to testify in court 45 hours later.  Ed's wife, Percey Clay, and one of their pilots, Brit Hale are put in protective custody and the excitement begins.  Lincoln and Amelia Sachs are asked to help identify the culprit and so begins the decent into tons of crime scene evidence.<br /><br />This hired killer is the best and finding him is almost impossible, but the \\"almost impossible\\" is Lincoln Rhyme's forte.  Lincoln and Amelia must find the evidence to stop the Coffin Dancer from striking again and eliminating the other two witnesses.<br /><br />As with all of Jeffrey Deaver's books, The Coffin Dancer is full of action, tons of twists and turns to keep the reader off balance, and information on forensic evidence that I find truly amazing.  This information might not be logical, but it does make for interesting reading!  I was amazed that Lincoln Rhyme would ask for scrapings from the tires of emergency vehicles that responded to Ed Carney's airplane crash to see what trace evidence he could find.<br /><br />Deaver's also continues the tête-&agrave;-tête between Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs in what is becoming a \\"will he or won't he\\" scenario.  You find yourself cheering on the forthrightness of Amelia and hoping that she finally gets her man!  Ok, so I'm a romantic at heart...<br /><br />I'd have to agree with the Kirkus Reviews that state \\"Deaver is just as cunning and deceptive as his killer; don't assume he's run out of tricks until you've run out of pages.\\"  And I also concur that Lincoln Rhyme is like \\"Patricia Cornwell attached to a time bomb\\".  Perfect analysis!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great thriller.  Do NOT get this book if you don't have time to read because you won't want to put it down until that last page is read.  Take it along with you on vacation so you won't have to stay awake on work nights trying to finish it.

This is the type of book that makes you go \\"ah\\" at the end.<br /><br />Linda Howard has a knack for blending romance and mystery, but tends to lean a bit more towards the romance angle of the story.  In Kill and Tell she weaves a tale about Karen Whitlaw, a nurse with an interesting family background.  Karen's father came home from the Vietnam War to his wife and child as a changed man.  Upon his return, he never seemed to be able to fit back into a normal life like so many soldiers from that era and chose to leave his family and live on the streets in various cities.  He'd bounce back every couple of years for short periods of time, but Karen had since decided that she'd rather not have anything to do with a man that could abandon his wife and child.  It had been 20 plus years since she'd seen her father, when this saga begins.<br /><br />A few weeks after Karen's mother dies, her grieving is interrupted when a package arrives from her father addressed to her mother.  Karen tosses it into a box with some of her mother's belongings and conveniently forgets that it's there.  She doesn't even remember the box when she's called a short time later by a New Orleans detective, Marc Chastain, and told that her father has been murdered.  Ok, so this is a tad unbelievable, but I'll chock it up to shock on Karen's part, as it's a minor flaw in the plot.<br /><br />Karen flies down to New Orleans to identify her father's body and make arrangements for burial.  When she meets the gorgeous Marc with the bedroom voice, her heart goes thump and so begins the true plot of this book - an unlikely romance between Karen and Marc.  It's love at first sight, with them both ignoring the signs and symptoms (typical romance scheme).  We're taken on a sensual journey of seduction as Marc tries to win over the elusive Karen.  After a passionate night of sexual exploration, Karen bolts from New Orleans and flees back to Ohio.<br /><br />Ok, so that would have been an interesting journey, but instead Howard brings back the mystery portion and puts the romance on the back burner.  Seems someone wants a \\"kill book\\" that was in the box sent to Karen and will go to any means to obtain it, including killing her.  After two attempts on her life, Karen races back to New Orleans and into the arms of her knight in shining armor.<br /><br />Kill and Tell is not for the die-hard mystery fans, as there is more romantic adventures than intrigue.  It's a nice blend and an enjoyable read.  If you're a mystery buff, then you won't be fooled at all by the attempt to disguise the true villain.  If you want a good romance with hot and steamy scenes, punctuated by a bit of \\"who dunit\\" to keep the story interesting, then Kill and Tell is the novel for you!

Robb is the fifth book in this \\"In Death\\" series by this author who is the alter ego of Nora Roberts. This pseudonym is only used for her futuristic series (don't let that genre fool you - these books are fantastic, even if you don't usually like science fiction type stories!)<br /><br />It seems that each of the books in this series so far has the murders involving Eve Dallas' lover/husband, Roarke, in some form or another and this one is no different. If you've read these from the first book, Naked in Death, then you've followed the relationship evolution between the two strong main characters and you've been given a glimpse of each of their pasts. Vengeance in Death explores, in greater detail, Roarke's past and that of his butler, Summerset.<br /><br />A killer is loose and he's killing men with Irish links; unfortunately, that Irish link is Roarke and his past crimes. Summerset's daughter, Marlena, had been brutally murdered in Dublin, Ireland many years before and Roarke avenged her death by killing the six men responsible. Now it seems that someone is killing Roarke's informants from the past. It's Eve Dallas' job as primary homicide detective in the cases to find out who this mad man is and stop him before another victim is found.<br /><br />Sounds like a typical \\"who dun it?\\" type book right? Well with J.D. Robb, you can always expect to find a bit more intrigue, romance and humor thrown into the plot. The added character of Ian McNibb (Electronic Detective Division Wonder-boy) is a pure stroke of genius. And the undertones of a romantic entanglement between McNibb and Officer Delia Peabody (Dallas' able assistant) leaves the reader wanting more and not being able to wait to read the next book to find out if these two actually do get together.<br /><br />One of my favorite support characters, Mavis, is missing from this book - actually, she makes a very brief appearance, and that leaves a bit of fun out of the story line. But don't worry - the other colorful characters are all there - Commander Whitney, Police Chief Tibble, Summerset, Peabody, Dr. Mira, and of course Eve and Roarke.<br /><br />The identity of the killer wasn't predictable this time, and actually had me guessing up to the end of the book. The clues as to his identity were few and far between, but the outcome made sense once everything was in the open.<br /><br />Vengeance in Death is more sound writing from J.D. Robb and her versions of the future are impressive. I want a turbo car that can go from New York City to New Los Angeles in three hours just as they have in this book! (With gas prices the way they are now, I'm wondering what kind of gas and gas mileage they're getting in the future!) It will be interesting to see if the world is any closer to these creations in the year 2058 - only 57 more years to go and we'll see! But I'm first in line for one of those AutoChef inventions that cooks your meal upon voice command - no cooking, no cleaning - ah, paradise!<br /><br />Vengeance in Death isn't the best book in the series that I've read, but it is still excellent.ne.

US	51874804	R3VL4TAN9MVC2I	0671038443	79347454	The Devil's Teardrop	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Dot the I, Cross the T	I'm a newly devoted Jeffrey Deaver fan and absolutely love the Lincoln Rhyme stories.  I've read a couple of non-Lincoln tales, and they were ok, but not on the level as the Lincoln sagas.  So I went into The Devil's Teardrop a bit apprehensive.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed every page of this book!<br /><br />The Devil's Teardrop is set on New Year's Eve in Washington D.C.  The story begins when a killer, known as the Digger, walks into the Metro Center subway terminal and shoots hundreds of rounds from an Uzi, killing many and wounding even more.  He is then able to leave unnoticed because of the panic among the survivors - because no one sees the Digger.  A ransom note is delivered to the Mayor that states the Digger will continue on his rampage, killing people every four hours, until $ 20 million is placed at the specified location.  Oh and did I mention that the Digger is not the mastermind behind this terror event, only a robotic type human who does whatever he's told?  If the mastermind behind this escapade is captured, the Digger will continue to kill mass quantities of people.  Talk about a built-in escape route!<br /><br />It is up to Parker Kincaid, a sexy, macho document analyst who must be talked out of his early retirement to help solve this case.  He must search the strange ransom note to find any clues to help solve the identity of both the Digger and the mastermind.<br /><br />Enter Special Agent In Charge Margaret Lukas who lives in self-imposed exile from emotions due to a horrible secret buried in her recent past.  She and Kincaid strive to stop the killing and put an end to the reign of terror that has fallen on Washington D.C.  Of course, chemistry is also a factor between them and it's amusing to see both of them hop scotching away from any involvement with the other.<br /><br />Typical to Deaver's style, this story is fast paced; full of surprises along the journey and it's wonderfully entertaining.  Several times the good guys are only a few minutes away from catching the Digger, only to result in a near miss.  The reader can feel the frustration of the agents!<br /><br />The thing that gives away the identity of Deaver's villain, is that when everyone thinks they know the answer and it's right there in front of you, there are between 50 and 75 pages left to read.  Why would an author need that many pages to wrap up the loose ends?  Yep, that's a definite clue that the identity of the killer is WRONG!  So then Deaver makes your mind begin to toil with figuring out all the key players in this plot.  And he's a master at making the reader guess and guess and guess.<br /><br />The end is a great shoot-um-up style that is like any good action movie - lots of gunfire, explosions, and fighting.  You won't be disappointed.  And the character development in The Devil's Teardrop is fantastic.  One of Jeffrey Deaver's strong attributes is the ability to get the reader to draw a mental picture of all of the characters, because with his books, you never know who the bad guy really is until the very last page!<br /><br />As always, it's entertaining, funny at times, and a roller coaster ride until the very end.  Just when you are trying to catch your breath, you'll start laughing.  An example is when Kincaid calls Lincoln Rhyme for advice on forensic evidence (dust found on the envelope and where that dust is located in the city).  Lincoln is his ornery self, yelling at Amelia for a glass of scotch while trying to help Parker Kincaid.  And the ex-wife scenario leaves you shaking your head wondering at how some people have children - seems Parker Kincaid's ex-wife is so self absorbed that she doesn't even bring Christmas gifts to her own children, but comes by to tell Parker that she's filing for full custody.  Things in life that make you go hmmm...  The side journeys are well worth the read, and an added bonus to this great main story!Several times the good guys are only a few minutes away from catching the Digger, only to result in a near miss.

The Second Time Around doesn't have much suspense and the mystery of whodunit leaves a bit to be desired.  In fact, I had the villains figured out from the very beginning, and the only surprise was a side-plot twist that seems to have been thrown in at the end to make everyone feel good.<br /><br />Carley DeCarlo is reporter who is tossed into the story of the century.  Her stepsister's husband is killed in a plane crash just as his company's cancer vaccine is approaching the final testing stages.  Rumors begin to surface about Nicholas Spencer fleecing his company right before his death, that the test results show the cancer vaccine is ineffective, him faking his own death, and his romantic fling with an administrative assistant.  Carley delves into the story to find the truth and is almost killed in the process.  But in the end, the truth does prevail, leaving the reader saying, \\"So what?\\"<br /><br />Clark flip flops between Carley narrating the story and Ned, a man driven over the edge by the recent death of his wife, Annie.  It's an interesting way to write the book and actually keeps the reader more hooked than if the narration had only been from one character.  This is one of the few positive things about the book...<br /><br />The characters are semi-developed and the plot lines are fuzzy at times.  In fact, the epilogue reads as if it's a final report summing all sub-plots and support characters with bullet points.  It felt as if Mary Higgins Clark became tired of writing, just stopped and quickly finished the story.<br /><br />The Queen of Suspense needs to give her crown to someone more deserving (Iris Johansen, Sharon Sala, or Linda Howard come to my mind).  Her stories are becoming mundane and lack the zing we saw in the beginning of her writing career.<br /><br />The Second Time Around is a decent story but I'd hate to pay full price for it.  Check out Amazon's used book section to get this one!  The story doesn't have a grip on the reader and falls flat.pay full price for it.  Check out Amazon's used book section to get this one!

Yeah, I know she has written in the romance genre too, and those novels were \\"ok\\".  But her mystery books are the ones that I can't put down - literally!<br /><br />Envy begins with a mysterious prologue that arrives at the office of Maris Matherly-Reed, an executive vice-president and editor of Matherly Press.  Since there is no name on the small portion of the manuscript (only initials) or address (just the name of an island off of the coast of Georgia), it is tossed into a \\"slush pile\\".  When Maris finally reads it, she is intrigued and is determined to find the author.  She goes to great lengths to do just that.  I know, most publishers would never go to that kind of trouble, but Sandra Brown makes the story believable.<br /><br />One of Brown's strongest attributes as a gifted writer is her character development and this book showcases that talent.  Maris Matherly-Reed was born into money and should be a spoiled brat, but instead is caring and a romantic at heart, besides being an incredible editor.  Parker Evans, author of the prologue, is earthy, crude and out for vengeance, but the reader can't help but like him.  Noah Reed, Maris' husband, by all appearances, seems dashing and suave but comes out to be the villain that is the definition of someone with a black heart, whom the reader soon despises.<br /><br />The secondary characters are also well developed.  Daniel Matherly, Maris' father, is the perfect patriarch and loving father, besides being a respected member of the publishing world.  Nadia Schuller is conceited, egotistical, and a witch (can't put the real name her, Epinions won't let me!).  Mike, Parker's assistant, is kind, caring and truly a southern gentleman.<br /><br />The story centers on Maris' life in New York City, between her work and her social life.  The reader instantly understands that her marriage isn't wonderful when Noah constantly pushes her aside for \\"duty\\" and is not caring at all.  This is made even more obvious when Nadia enters the picture - yeah, the affair is pretty apparent and the reader isn't fooled at all when it comes to light.  When Maris goes to St. Anne Island in Georgia to find this reclusive author and convince him to let Matherly Press publish his book, she begins a journey that will change her life forever.<br /><br />Sandra Brown is excellent at making the reader think he/she knows what's going to happen next and then surprising him/her.  In fact, I thought I had this storyline figured out from page one.  Why did I keep reading when I thought I knew all of the ins and outs?  The absorbing narrative bouncing between real life and Parker's autobiographical story being submitted, kept me reading non-stop.  There were a few little tidbits I hadn't figured out along the way that were amusing.  The sequence of events were always interesting and never boring.  And then the finale...<br /><br />I have to say that Sandra Brown fooled me.  Not much, but she did pull one over on me.  By the time I finished the last page, I had a smile on my face.  Yep, I enjoy a book even more when it tricks me!<br /><br />This book kept my attention so much so, that I thought about calling into work and telling them I was sick so I could take the day off to finish Maris' journey through life.  My conscience got the better of me, and I went to work and anxiously watched the clock for quitting time, so I could resume reading.

US	51874804	R1O57B5WNZHN8E	0671016776	12366720	Gravity	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Exploding Corpses and Invading Organisms	Have you ever read a book and when you finish you're not sure if you liked it?  Well, I finished Gravity the other night and I'm still not sure if I liked it.  It has definitely made me think, that's for sure.  I even read a few other reviews on it and was amazed at how everyone raved about it.  What did I miss in this book that everyone else seemed to love?  Maybe I should go back and make sure I don't have a whole chapter or two that is missing!<br /><br />Gravity by Tess Gerritsen focuses on the International Space Station (ISS) and a female astronaut, Dr. Emma Watson, who is a flight surgeon.  Emma is sent up to replace a doctor aboard the space station whose wife was critically injured in an automobile accident.  Since they have two small children at home, the astronaut is needed and Emma is sent up ahead of her crew's launch date.  This was a bit strange too, as I didn't know that once in the ISS, you could be called home and retrieved within a day or two.  An interesting tidbit of information there...<br /><br />After the doctor learns of his wife's critical condition he mentally shuts down, only thinking about getting back home.  While in deep depression, he makes a drastic error in an experiment with Archaeons, a supposedly harmless sea life form.  Ok, why did NASA let him continue any of the experiments when he was in no condition to do anything except sit and stare out the station window looking back towards earth?  This just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the story, but it was a must or there wouldn't be any story.<br /><br />After the Archaeon is leaked into the sealed area used for experiments, a mouse is placed into the same sealed container.  A blue-green globule floats by the mouse and she licks it making the Japanese astronaut handling it smile.  Little did he know that the rodent was now contaminated and infected with a contagion.  Ok, if you were a scientist, and a blue-green blob floats by, wouldn't you be a bit concerned?  Again, it just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Then the mouse bites the Japanese astronaut and the spread of this deadly organism has begun.  Sounds like a lot of circumstances to happen before the organism begins it's journey, and I wondered if it wasn't just a bit too much for the reader to actually believe.  It actually sounds like the story line \\"This is the house that Jack built...\\"<br /><br />Then the other angle to the book (the romantic side), is that of Emma's soon-to-be ex-husband, Jack McCallum.  He too happens to be a doctor, happens to be on duty in the emergency room when the astronaut's wife is brought in from the traffic collision, happens to still be in love with Emma, happens to have been an astronaut but was kept off of active assignments for medical reasons, happens to still have access to Mission Control and other pertinent rooms, happens to ... well you get the idea.  Again, way too many coincidences for my taste but necessary to bring the entire story together.<br /><br />The book has a decent plot, but there are too many happenstance scenarios that need to take place in order for the story to move along and the organism continue on its wicked path.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this book was written before Harvest and Bloodstream, but in my opinion, those two books were far superior to this one.  Gerritsen's normal style of bringing in vividly descriptive medical procedures was overshadowed by her detail to the space program (and what was with all of the acronyms that had to be looked up in a glossary in the back of the book?  One of my pet peeves is having to stop reading and look up an acronym!).<br /><br />The ending seemed rushed and was very predictable, wavering between the medical thriller and romance genres just a bit too much.  Jack rescuing the love of his life with his white charger, in this case a rocket made by a non-NASA company, was inevitable.  And the happily-ever-after ending was a bit contrite.<br /><br />I feel this one just stretched my imagine a bit too far.  It was a decent novel, but not one that I'd recommend above many of the other summer reads out there - only when there's nothing else on the bookshelf.ne just stretched my imagine a bit too far.

US	51874804	RDQ7JJSQWVUCJ	0743460529	991690611	Daddy's Little Girl	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Great Intensity but Won't Fool You	In my opinion, Mary Higgins Clark hasn't written a great book in years, but this one comes close. I have to agree with one professional reviewer's comment, \\"A solid if unremarkable page-turner.\\" Many have touted Daddy's Little Girl as \\"inspired and energized\\" because Clark deviates from her normal writing style and uses a \\"First Person\\" style for this book. If the intrigue and suspense were there, the First Person versus Third Person style wouldn't be the focus and the actual story would be the focal point.<br /><br />When Ellie Cavanaugh was a child her sister, Andrea, was beaten to death. Andrea's wealthy boyfriend, Rob Westerfield, was tried and convicted of the brutal murder. After spending twenty-three years in prison, Westerfield is up for parole. He has always maintained his innocence and vows upon his release to find the real killer. Determined to prove that he is the real killer, Ellie, now an investigative reporter, begins to write a book that will show everyone why the right person was convicted of her sister's slaying.<br /><br />As Ellie begins to research evidence, she discovers clues into another murder that might be linked to her sister's. But someone doesn't want that information uncovered and will go to great lengths to see that Ellie stops digging. At this point, the story becomes a bit over-kill. Every time Ellie turns around, Rob Westerfield shows up, like at the Inn where she is having dinner, in a neighboring town where she visits, etc. And Ellie's life becomes threatened. The small apartment over a garage that she rents is broken into and a fire breaks out, where she barely escapes. Her car is broken into and destroyed. And on and on. Is it Westerfield or someone else who doesn't want her finding the answers to her sister's death?<br /><br />Minor characters play into the mix when Will Nebels, the local handyman, points the finger at someone other than Rob Westerfield. Nebels had been working in the area where Andrea's body was found, and after all these years, decides to come forward and point the finger at someone else. Yep, old money has a way of paving the way for many things, including a witness showing up after all of this time to take the heat off of a family member.<br /><br />Nebels happens to shift blame towards Paulie Stroebel, a classmate of Andrea's, who is a bit slow, but is very sweet. It seems he was part of a love triangle right before Andrea turned up dead. Paulie works with his mother in a local deli that they own and has never gotten over Andrea's death. What else do we know about Paulie - nothing. That's about the extent of this character development. It really leaves the reader lacking enough understanding to become involved in this part of the book other than on a peripheral basis.<br /><br />The best part of Daddy's Little Girl is the way Mary Higgins Clark can create tension. The reader knows Rob Westerfield will show up at the most inopportune times. It becomes irrelevant as to whether Rob Westerfield really did commit these murders, but the point of how and when Clark decides to reveal the identity of the killer becomes the main focus. The actual identity becomes secondary to the tension built around the revelation.<br /><br />A few minor occurrences peaks the reader's interest also. Clark throws in some secondary characters that I found lacked development. We are introduced to Ellie's estranged father who hasn't been a part of her life since shortly after her sister died. He has since remarried and Ellie has a half-brother. This half-brother is determined to start a relationship with Ellie. Why? What is he like in his life (other than being a great high school athlete) that would make him want to seek out a sister he has never met? These side trips into other characters are lacking the usual growth Mary Higgins Clark gives her characters.<br /><br />Daddy's Little Girl is better than recent Mary Higgins Clark novels, but is still deficient in the zing of her early works. It'sa decent book but if you're looking for a book that will have enough twists and turns in it to fool you, this is not the one for you. If you're looking for an intense story, similar to riding in a speeding car going down a straight road, this is the book for you - extreme, but you see where you're going the entire time.her early works.

US	51874804	R1EASER1IFR02I	042518630X	371295585	Purity in Death	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Interesting Concept...	You'd think with as many books as Nora Roberts, AKA JD Robb, publishes in a year, that she'd run out of ideas. That is definitely not the case, and her plots are fantastic. I often wonder where she comes up with this stuff!<br /><br />In the latest addition to her futuristic series Roberts explores a concept foreign to all of us - the ability to spread infection to a human being through a computer virus. Sounds a little bit like Twilight Zone, doesn't it?<br /><br />When Officer Trueheart hears a woman scream for help as he's walking home, he responds immediately. When he sees a crazed man beating her to death, he intervenes and ends up using his stun gun. Unfortunately the stun kills the guy and Trueheart panics and calls Eve Dallas to come investigate.<br /><br />Seems the crazy guy, Louie Cogburn, a schoolyard drug dealer, was the first victim of a terrorist organization intent on ridding the world of scum who prey on children. The first clue for Dallas was a message left on Cogburn's computer screen that stated, \\"Absolute Purity Achieved\\".<br /><br />When the infected computer is taken to EDD to see if the elite police geeks can figure out what has caused Cogburn to go ballistic, Detective Hollingsworth is given the assignment. Within a few hours, Hollingsworth is infected and goes nuts. He shoots fellow geek, Ian McNab and takes his commander, Feeney, hostage. Eve Dallas negotiates a hostage release, but in the end isn't able to save Hollingsworth as his brain is too far gone.<br /><br />That's two down due to a computer virus. Can it really happen? Can a computer virus infect a human? Eve asks her drop-dead gorgeous husband, Roarke, who states it doesn't happen that way. Computers can infect other computers but not humans. It's stated so matter-of-factly that the reader has an instant clue that this is exactly what has happened. I almost heard that Twilight Zone music at this point in the book!<br /><br />Eve calls together a special operations task force and they begin trying to isolate this virus while tracking down the vigilante group dispensing said virus. As two more predators are eliminated, she gets closer to the identities with each murder. This tale is more about Eve having clues fall into her lap instead of excellent detective work to mete out the identities of the bad guy(s).<br /><br />Many of Roberts/Robb's characters from previous books make an appearance in this one. Jamie, the grandson of a slain police officer, helps on the investigation. Trueheart, the rookie cop who is too sweet and naïve for his own good, makes the discovery of the first victim and saves the life of the women Cogburn is beating. Delia Peabody is again Dallas' trusty sidekick, but this time she's a bit more outspoken. Ian McNab is his zany self, but we see a sensitive side when he is recovering from his injuries that happened when he was zapped by Hollingsworth's stun gun. Feeney is again munching on his sugared almonds and dolling out his wisdom to Eve. Baxter, of Internal Affairs Department, shows up to lend a helping hand. Mavis makes an appearance as only Mavis can - in a wild outfit with matching hair, and news that she's pregnant (which throws both Eve and Roarke for a loop). And yes, Roarke is there as always - Roarke the gorgeous Irishman with the lilt to his voice, the blue eyes that melts Eve's heart, long black hair, and is romantic enough to have all the women swooning over him.<br /><br />The book isn't full of surprises, as the reader will figure out the villains midway through, but it is full of interesting dialogue and side plots.

US	51874804	RZQAA3519LP1R	B00069SPVG	552975098	No One to Trust	Books	5	2	3	N	N	As usual Iris Johansen delivers another winner!	For those of you that have read my past reviews, me stating that I am an avid Iris Johansen fan will come as no surprise. I have read all of her books in the mystery genre. The writing style, plot, characterization, etc., found in No One To Trust validates my enthusiasm for Johansen.<br /><br />Iris Johansen has written several books with the reoccurring characters of Eve Duncan, Joe Quinn, Logan, Sarah, and Sean Galen. The reader has only been given glimpses of Sean Galen in these past works. He's the mercenary and best friend everyone wants in his/her corner. No One To Trust brings him to the spotlight and we finally get to know the real Sean Galen.<br /><br />Elena Kyler was born into rebel army life. Her father was an American mercenary but then decided to stay in Colombia to fight for a cause he believed in. It was a tough childhood, and Elena is strong and depends on no one as a result of this upbringing. That is until her child becomes endangered. After Elena's father died, the rebel army became involved with a drug kingpin, Rico Chavez. Chavez has recently found out that he has a son by Elena, and will go to great lengths to get that five-year-old boy and raise him. Elena will do whatever it takes to keep that from happening, even if it means giving up her life.<br /><br />Elena contacts the DEA and makes a deal: They get her out of Colombia and she guarantees that Chavez will follow. The DEA wants Chavez bad enough so the deal is sealed. Since Sean Galen specializes in \\"difficult situations\\", he's called on to lead the extraction.<br /><br />What follows is a series of events that would make the producers of Mission Impossible 2 thrilled. There is a breath-taking airlift escape (where they dangle from ropes hoping they are not shot before making it to the safety inside of the helicopter); a house fire (where Chavez shows his power and destroys Elena's home); and lots of angry men left behind in Colombia vowing revenge (because Chavez will kill them if they don't find Elena). When Sean, Elena, Barry (Elena's son), and the others get to California, they take refuge in a vineyard safe house. But the story just begins to pick up speed at this point.<br /><br />It seems that Sean Galen is the only one who can help Elena protect her son until Chavez is either captured or killed. The dashing fortune soldier is definitely up for the task, but he's not up to the feelings that have sprouted for Elena. He's a macho man, he's not used to feeling anything other than anger and hatred.<br /><br />There is a bit more romance involved than in her earlier Eve Duncan books, but it doesn't deter from the main action type story line. The book is fast paced and the reader will have trouble putting it down. I know I did and went on much less sleep than usual until I finished No One To Trust.<br /><br />I will admit that And Then You Die and Ugly Duckling were much more solid books, but this is very enjoyable. The twists found at the end of Johansen books are usually better covered, but this one was on the predictable side. However, that didn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />I guess No One To Trust is a cross between a Mission Impossible theme and a romance. And the hardness of the two main characters is overshadowed at times by their hearts. It makes one wonder if there is a soft spot in the hearts of all assassins.<br /><br />Again, my biggest complain with Iris Johansen is that she doesn't write fast enough. It will be months before her next book is on sale.hem if they don't find Elena). When Sean, Elena, Barry (Elena's son), and the others get to California, they take refuge in a vineyard safe house.

I'd have to consider myself a \\"newbie\\" to Jeffrey Deavers, as I've only read four of his books, but am definitely a fan.  His writing is intense, the stories draw you in from the beginning and won't let go, and the endings are always full of surprises.  Well, that's what I thought about all of the books, except this one - Maiden's Grave - it didn't grab my attention but let me wander for about 50 or so pages.  When the action did pick up, it was intriguing and then lax - definitely not a book that you couldn't put down on the coffee table.  This one actually took me a while to finish.<br /><br />The story begins with a busload of deaf students riding along the highway between the Kansas wheat fields.  The reader isn't sure exactly what they're doing, except they are going to a type of recital, the purpose of the trip is eluded to but never clarified until much later in the book.  The bus comes on the scene of a fatality accident so the bus driver and teacher leave the bus to see if they can help the victims.  But this wreck was no accident, and the students and adults are soon thrown into a nightmare.<br /><br />Three escaped convicts take the eight deaf students and two adults hostage and hold them in an abandoned slaughterhouse a few miles from the accident scene.  The leader of the thugs, Lou Handy, is intelligent and seems to have thought of all possibilities.  The other two are more hard-core - Shepard Wilcox is young and doesn't blink if he needs to kill someone; \\"Sonny\\" Bonner is a child rapist who's gazes toward the girls gives everyone the creeps.<br /><br />The FBI sends in their best hostage negotiator, Arthur Potter.  He's personable and sincerely cares about the captives.  Also trying to help rescue the girls is a variety of local law enforcement agencies who are all trying to come up with their own rescue endeavors and don't want to work as a team.  In addition is a local politician who is more worried about how he'll look on camera than helping these girls.<br /><br />When initial contact is made, Handy tells Potter that he'll kill one girl an hour unless his demands are met, and so the story goes...<br /><br />I learned a lot about hostage negotiations in this book - they never give in to the \\"taker\\" and only appease him/her until they can find a way to get the hostages out.  But the trick in these negotiations is making the \\"taker\\" think they are going to give in and meet the demands.<br /><br />The character development was, as always, excellent.  The depiction of the abandoned slaughterhouse made my skin crawl with the descriptions of bloodstains and stench of decaying flesh (ewww!).  The story flowed well, it just wasn't as action packed as The Bone Collector, The Coffin Dancer, or The Devil's Teardrop.<br /><br />I often found my mind wondering why.  (Ok, here are specific details from the book, so if you're planning on reading it, please skip this paragraph!).  Why did the bus driver get raped?  Why did the girls keep repeating part of the poem that was to be delivered at the recital - was it pertinent?  Why did Arthur fixate on the young schoolteacher and begin to have intimate feelings toward someone he'd never met?  There were just too many questions without answers for my taste.<br /><br />Overall the book was a good read, but I'd put others ahead on your Must Read list - save this one for a time when you've run out of \\"great\\" reading material and are delving into the \\"good\\" reading material.these girls. <br /> <br />When initial contact is made, Handy tells Potter that he'll kill one girl an hour unless his demands are met, and so the story goes...   <br /> <br />I learned a lot about hostage negotiations in this book - they never give in to the \\"taker\\" and only appease him/her until they can find a way to get the hostages out.

In fact, I set my computer calendar to pop up a reminder at 7:30 AM the morning this book went on sale.  (Ok, so I'm a biblio-aholic, I admit it - I also have other author's new releases set for reminders, e.g. Jeffrey Deaver, Iris Johansen, as well as Nora Roberts).  It's a great way to get the books hot off the press!  So, the reminder comes on, I call a friend who just happens to be going to Sam's Club, and beg him to pick up a copy and drop it off at work for me so I could begin reading during my lunch break.  (I already admitted that I'm addicted to books!).  And then I restlessly waited for the clock to strike noon...  Boy was I ever disappointed!<br /><br />Face the Fire focuses on the third witch in the series, Mia Devlin - the knockout redhead with a strong sense of self who has honed her witchcraft to a level others only dream about.  We've been given glimpses of Mia in the other two books and heard about the love of her life, Sam Logan.  It seems that Sam had run away from Three Sisters Island and Mia when he was just out of high school.  Now he's returned over a decade later to try to win her love back and take over the Magick Inn, previously owned by his family.  But we weren't told in the other books that Sam too is a witch.  That was an interesting twist of events.<br /><br />Typical plot for a love story, but then you throw in the island curse to change it a bit.  Mia (her power is Fire) must make the right choice about her heart and Sam or evil will prevail and the island will sink into the sea.  In Dance upon the Air Nell (her power is the Air) made the right choice with Zack and overcame the evil set against her.  In Heaven and Earth Ripley (her power is Earth) curbed her anger and chose Mac and life.  So everyone already knows that Mia will make the right choice in this one, because it's predictable, as it's supposed to be in a romance book.  At least with the first two the reader was enthralled and kept entertained until the very end with emotional drama that has made Nora Roberts famous.<br /><br />If I had to use one word to describe this book is would be \\"lacking\\".  It lacks the character development Roberts' fans expect.  It does have decent development, but we don't get inside Sam and Mia's heads and truly understand their personalities.  It lacks excitement.  Come on, the evil always coming in the form of a wolf to Mia.  Also there are bits and pieces that are superfluous to the story.  The visiting author going to the island for a book signing just didn't fit.  Was Roberts making a plea to some small island bookstore to invite her to do a book-signing event?  It makes me wonder because there was absolutely no purpose otherwise for this subplot.<br /><br />There were a few moments when there was hope for something spectacular - like when the garden gnome came to life (reminiscent of Stephen King's Shining).  But those moments went by without being developed into something fantastic.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the first two books in the series, and give this one an \\"average\\" rating.  It would be interesting if Nora Roberts writes an epilogue to this series someday or another trilogy featuring the children of these couples.  She's got the makings of great plot lines: magic, charismatic characters, fantastic scenery, and untapped energy.

I'm not really sure how to start this review - I just finished the book Saturday night and my mind is still jumbled by the last few chapters.  Up until the ending, it was a fantastic book, but it just seemed as if Linda Howard realized she had written almost 400 pages and needed to end the story.  So, she called a halt to it without tying up all the loose ends.<br /><br />All the Queen's Men starts off with a CIA operation in the Middle East that goes awry.  \\"Tucker\\" is the head of the Black Ops clandestine maneuver.  He stays behind with Niema Burdock, an electronics expert, to make sure everything is readied for their flight to safety after the chemical laboratory is blown up.  As he listens to radio transmissions, he and Niema realize the men sent to the factory are in grave danger.  Niema's husband, Dallas, is killed as they listen to his final transmission right before he detonates the explosives and himself.  \\"Tucker\\" gets Niema to safety a few days later and then disappears for five very long years when their paths once again meet.<br /><br />It seems \\"Tucker's\\" real name is John Medina and he is still in love with Niema (though he's never admitted it to anyone).  He persuades the CIA administration to let her help him track down the manufacturers of a new explosive called RDX-a, which needs no detonator and cannot be detected by current methods.  It seems this explosive has fallen into the hands of terrorists and it's John and Niema's job to stop them.  They go to France where the action begins.<br /><br />Louis Ronard is the dealer that has all the information needed by the CIA.  Niema goes undercover as a socialite visiting dear family friends who happen to be the French Ambassador and his wife.  At an embassy party, Niema meets Louis who is instantly smitten and invites her to his mansion for a few days of parties.  John becomes one of his alter egos and lets Louis know he's in the market to purchase large quantities of RDX-a and just happens to get an invitation to the same parties.<br /><br />I guess it's a bit like some current spy thrillers, but I felt as if Howard had a difficult time deciding if this should be a romance or a mystery and the melding of the two wasn't the best I've read.  There were times it was action packed and had your heart thumping; and then would instantly change into a very sensual scene.<br /><br />**This paragraph will give details of the plot, so do not read if you plan on reading the book**  One example is when Niema and John are in Louis' office setting a wire tap and copying his computer files while a house party is going on.  Through the security monitor on the desk, they see Louis coming down the hall towards his office.  John instantly has Niema lie down on the sofa and remove her undergarments.  He begins caressing her with both hands and mouth, while waiting for Louis to enter the office and hoping this ploy diverts attention as to why they are in his office in the first place.  Louis doesn't come in right away, so John takes it a step further and actually makes love to Niema, swallowing her screams of passion with his passionate kisses.  Louis never comes into the office and Niema is left wondering if this was just \\"part of the job\\" or did John really love her.  Not only was Niema a bit confused, so was the reader!  Definitely not part of most spy thrillers, unless it's James Bond!<br /><br />Upon leaving the office, they are spotted by a security guard and must flee the estate in a hail of gunfire.  After ditching their stolen car, they run on foot for hours and then continue their get-away.  After reaching the \\"company yacht\\" they upload the files and send to Washington DC and then continue their exploration of each other instead of fleeing for safety.  You can only imagine what happens next...<br /><br />This book leaves too many loose ends dangling, such as the death of Niema's husband and how both she and John feel guilty about it; will they have a relationship or not; will John take over as CIA head when they return; and several other questions that still need answers.  None are major components in the story, but together they just leave the reader wondering what is happening with all of the sub-plots.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent tale with excellent character development.  The scenes are described in vivid detail and the reader actually feels like he/she is at the dinner parties at the embassy or at Louis' estate.  If the ending wasn't hurried and if all of the loose ends had been tied up in a nice neat package, it would have been an excellent book.  Without those, it's only Very Good!or not; will John take over as CIA head when they return; and several other questions that still need answers.

US	51874804	R35Y57QGRHOXGP	0553586122	333130097	Reap the Wind (Wind Dancer)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Filled With Mystery and Erotic Sex	I have certain criteria which needs to be met in order for me to give a book an excellent rating.  One of those mandatory items is good editing.  The author could write a fantastic story, filled with intrigue and characters that burst out of the pages at you, but if the editing is substandard, then I can't get past it.  Thus causing my rating of the book to go down a notch.  This was the case with Reap the Wind - those glaring typos and a couple of minor storyline errors jumped out and spoiled the scene in my eyes.  Of course, this book is a reprint of an earlier work by Iris Johansen and I'm thrilled that her editor is either now more efficient, or she has a new one!<br /><br />Reap the Wind focuses on Caitlin Vasaro, a woman who has always had a love for the Wind Dancer.  The Wind Dancer, an antique statue shaped like a Pegasus, is said to possess mystical powers.  The statue has been passed down in the Andreas family for many generations and is often fodder for rumor and speculation, as well as plots for stealing it.  The myths surrounding the statue include stories of untold power for anyone in possession of it.<br /><br />Caitlin, as a distant cousin to the owner of the Wind Dancer, had studied the statue's history while in college, and pours over a family journal, which contains portions focusing on the statue.  She currently has returned to oversee and run the family flower farm in Italy and has produced a perfume that will \\"rock the world\\".  She always seems to be one step ahead of the bank mortgage and worries about them repossessing Vasaro (the name of the farm).  Vasaro is depicted as Utopia - fields of flowers, fruit trees, vineyard, mansion, and various outhouses.  Yes, sounds like Utopia to me!<br /><br />Caitlin's life is high stress constantly wondering if the elements will destroy the flower crop, and if so, how she'll make the next mortgage payment or payroll.  Then an opportunity that's too good to be true walks into her life.  That opportunity comes in the form of Alex Karazov, a wealthy businessman, ex-CIA/KGB man, who makes her a business proposition she can't refuse.  He's willing to put up his money to market her perfume, thus paying off the mortgage on Vasaro.  She enters the deal, knowing there is more to it than she is being told.<br /><br />Most people can see where this story is going.  Yes, Caitlin and Alex begin a mad, passionate love affair (and some of those scenes in the book are very steamy and not for those that blush at the mere mention of sex).  But the surprise is the mystery that comes along with the romance.  It seems others of a more evil nature are planning to steal the Wind Dancer while on loan for the perfume advertising campaign.<br /><br />(NOTE:  This section contains key information about the plot - skip if you are planning to read the book)The story takes you on a wild run through Europe in a chase to get the Wind Dancer back once it's stolen.  At times the action is a bit far-fetched, but it will definitely have your heart pumping.  The identity of a key villain, The Gypsy, was predictable, but the ending had a few twists and turns to keep it interesting.<br /><br />There were also scenes that are definitely overkill, such as guys repealing out of helicopters to torch Vasaro with flame-throwers.  Another hard one to fathom is the scene where the captain of a whaler shoots his harpoon at the people on the ship trying to save the whale.  But hey, there are only a few of those type scenes and it doesn't take away from the overall good story.<br /><br />This book is definitely one to read, as long as you don't focus on the typos and can get past the site seeing/shopping adventures.

US	51874804	R2YJPQ0SQ5PX2A	0553265741	249097119	Sacred Sins	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Murdering Priest	Nora Roberts wrote Sacred Sins in 1987 and it somehow slipped by my reading list until recently.  In fact, I just finished it a few minutes ago.  It wasn't the best book I've read this summer, but it wasn't the worst either and falls somewhere on middle ground.<br /><br />Dr. Tess Court is asked to give a psychological profile of a murderer the media has dubbed \\"The Priest\\".  The man kills his victims with a priest's amice (the ceremonial, white silk, priest's scarf), which he leaves neatly folded with a note that states, \\"Her Sins are Forgiven Her\\" on each of them.<br /><br />Assigned to the case are homicide detectives Ben Paris and his partner.  Ben isn't thrilled when the Mayor of Washington, D.C. asks Dr. Court to consult on the case after the second murder.  Ben feels the intrusion into true police work will take time away from finding the identity of the killer.  He and Tess have a battle of wills right from the beginning and sparks fly.  Sounds more like a love story, right?  Well it is, but with enough mystery/suspense thrown in to keep things a bit more lively than a true romance tale.<br /><br />After four victims, the killer focuses his attention on Dr. Court.  After a couple of phone calls it's apparent that she'll be his next, and last, victim.  Since Ben has fallen in love with the gorgeous psychiatrist, he's determined to do anything in his power to keep her safe.<br /><br />Nothing new to this plot line, yet with Nora Roberts writing it, it's a tour that gives insight into mental illness and deception.  This book fooled me for a short while, but then one scene made the identity of the killer obvious (obvious for those that understand the intricacies of writing a mystery and covering up key details anyway).  Roberts has gotten much better recently at hiding the villain than she did in this one!<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed most was the subplots.  We have Ben's partner Ed, a health nut who is trying to convince Ben that he should pay more attention to how he treats his body via diet, smoking and lack of exercise.  The exchanges between these two are hilarious at times.  We're given a glimpse at a family who is in denial that their teenage son is crying out for more help currently being given to him.  The story of Joey and the unfortunate circumstances in his life touches everyone's hearts.  And we're given glimpses of Senator Writemore, Tess's grandfather, who reminds me of another Scotsman with a strong personality, Daniel MacGregor.<br /><br />A few of the subplots were more confusing than enjoyable.  Like the few pages devoted to the run down ramshackle house that Ed buys.  Roberts vividly describes the critters living there, the decaying building, etc., and then nothing more.  Why was it even included in the first place?  A passing mention every now and then about Ed's progress on fixing it up, or his first Thanksgiving dinner there would have made it more viable.<br /><br />Another was the bit about Lowenstein and her family - why mention her kids and husband a couple of times and have her on stake-out thinking about it being her youngest child's bath time.  This just didn't make any sense to me since those characters hadn't been developed and Lowenstein had minimal development.<br /><br />And when I read the back of the cover before starting the book, it indicated that these crimes took place in the \\"lazy days of summer\\" during \\"a merciless heat wave\\".  Well, the first murder did but there was more mention of cold weather than a heat wave.  It sure wasn't the most accurate description of the book!<br /><br />Overall it was a quick read and entertaining for the most part.  It's not mind-boggling and a book that you have to think a lot about to enjoy.  It's not one that interrupts your schedule, but can easily fit in whenever you have a few spare minutes to read.ould pay more attention to how he treats his body via diet, smoking and lack of exercise.

US	51874804	R2NTV1LMKHA1RO	0671027581	305895234	Open Season	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Should be Shot Off the Bestsellers List!	One of my pet peeves is when the small blurb on the back of the book or on the dust jacket doesn't match the actual story.  Nothing is more infuriating as knowing I've mislead in order to get a book sale.  Open Season definitely lost points with me because of this deceptive manipulation.<br /><br />The actual back of the book reads, \\"The perennial good girl, Daisy transforms herself into a party girl extraordinaire -- dancing the night away at clubs, laughing and flirting with abandon -- and she's declared open season for man-hunting. But her free-spirited fun turns to shattering danger when she witnesses something she shouldn't -- and becomes the target of a killer. Now, before she can meet the one man who can share her life, first she may need him to save it.\\"  Ok, sounds like a suspense book, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />Open Season is really a romance book with very little suspense; maybe no suspense would be a better description.  The story is definitely about Daisy Minor but not about her being the target of a killer.  It's about Daisy's developing into a party girl and her trolling the nightclubs for a suitable husband so she can get married and start a family.  Daisy doesn't encounter the murder until over halfway through the book.  As for the \\"shattering danger\\" I never did find it, even when Daisy was carted off to another town to hide until the killer was caught!<br /><br />The real plot depicts Daisy waking up on her birthday bored with life and realizes she needs to make some drastic changes in order to snare a husband.  She seeks the help of a local antiques dealer, who is supposedly gay, to make her a new woman.  He helps her change her hairstyle, her clothing and teaches her to apply make up.  Viola, a new woman has emerged.  **Groan!**  The many of subplots involving the antiques dealer, Daisy's mother (Evelyn), Aunt Jo, and the local mayor, are never developed past mere mentioning of small unimportant details which leave the reader wondering why they are mentioned at all.  Or key factors were never given which leaves the reader very confused as to the actions of these characters.<br /><br />Enter the hero of the story, the small town police chief, Jack Russo.  He's smitten with Daisy before the makeover and falls head over hells afterwards.  It's the same plot used in many romance books these days and has been referred to as a 'makeover and get the guy romance'.<br /><br />One of the things I found grating on my nerves time and again were the attitudes of the characters.  I often wondered in what decade this had been written because it reflected ideals from the 50's: Daisy's life isn't complete without husband and children; a male antiques deal must be gay; etc., etc.<br /><br />There was little character evolution and we're left up to our own to decide good, bad, or mediocre.  The most development came when Daisy got a puppy named Midas - the reader was given full details of everything Midas chewed, ate, or the trouble he caused.  It's too bad Howard didn't give equal time to the human characters in this book.<br /><br />Oh, and the epilogue was a joke!  I expected a lot more from Linda Howard and am really thrilled that this wasn't the first book of hers that I read, or I might not have picked up another one.  Because of the attempt at being a suspense thriller, this romance book falls far short of the intended goal and is average at best.  I wouldn't even recommend it because of the other great books out there, but if you've read all of them, then pick up a copy as a last resort.hy they are mentioned at all.

They held my interested, were always full of twists that you couldn't see coming, and you couldn't wait to pick up the next one.  Unfortunately the last few years, I don't feel that strong urge to wait at the bookstore for the next release by this author.  On the Street Where You Live was no exception to this and left me feeling blah.<br /><br />The story centers around Emily Graham, a defense attorney who recently returned to her ancestral home in Spring Lake, a sleepy resort type town.  There are so many factors leading to the plot, it takes Clark too many pages to get the action going.  First we need to know that Emily befriended an up-and-coming computer genius (Eric), who had the office next door to hers when they were both starting out in business.  She won a huge lawsuit for him, and in return he gave her shares in his new company.  She made millions when she sold those stocks a few years later.<br /><br />Next the reader needs to understand that Emily has enemies, all of which she is trying to escape.  One enemy is the ex-husband who sued her after their marriage ended (when she caught him in bed with her best friend) trying to get part of her millions.  Another is the guy who was convicted of stalking her because his mother was killed and he thinks she defended a murderer.  Oh it's so very confusing with all of this going on!<br /><br />So, we get back to the main story about fifty or so pages into the book, unlike Iris Johansen who has someone killed off on page 2 of her books!  Emily buys back the family home that was once her great-great-grandmother's in hopes to flee the chaos in her life before she returns to New York to work for a prestigious law firm.  This is when the action starts.<br /><br />The previous owners were having a pool constructed in the backyard, and Emily decides to continue with the plans.  As the backhoe is digging, a body is unearthed, believed to be that of Martha Lawrence, who had disappeared four years prior.  In her hand she is grasping a finger bone with a sapphire ring that had belonged to Madeline Shapley, Emily's great-great aunt.  Seems both had disappeared on September 7th, but 105 years apart.<br /><br />Then there are two more bodies found.  Again, both women disappeared on the same day, but a century apart.  The public starts to believe in a serial killer that has been reincarnated.  Emily doesn't buy into it and begins to do research to find out the similarities into the disappearances.  As Emily begins her quest to find the identity of the killer, the list of suspects seems endless:  a retired college present with a secret, his angry wife, a restaurant owner with memory lapses, etc.<br /><br />The list of characters would have been fine if they had been exciting.  One professional reviewer has described Clark's character development like this:  \\"Mary Higgins Clark's cast of characters may be overly large; in going for quantity she skimps on the characterization, and all of them, including Emily, are as wooden as Al Gore.\\"  Seems appropriate to me!<br /><br />The ending is predictable, and the subplots are boring.  I didn't care that the restaurant owner is trying to sell his place and will lose his shirt with the only offer out there.  I didn't care that the retired professor had a fling and is trying to cover it up and is being blackmailed.  These subplots are not developed enough to make them interesting.<br /><br />So, bottom line is On the Street Where You Live is typical of recent Mary Higgins Clark books.  They lack the zing that her earlier books had, thus becoming average.  So why would I recommend them, they still hold a modicum of entertainment.arthed, believed to be that of Martha Lawrence, who had disappeared four years prior.

In Jewels of the Sun and Tears of the Moon, we were treated to a glimpse of life in Ardmore, Ireland and exactly what that life entailed if you were a Gallagher.  I followed Jude and Adain's love story in the first book and was hooked on this trilogy.  Then came the story of Shawn and Brenna and I continued to be enthralled.  (I've written reviews on both of these books).  But I have to say, that even though I enjoyed the first two, I was anxiously awaiting the story of free-spirited Darcy Gallagher, and the outcome of the love shared between a faerie prince and the love he lost.  Ok, so it sounds a bit hokey but what can I say, I'm a romantic!<br /><br />Heart of the Sea is the finale of the Faerie Tale Trilogy and focuses on the youngest Gallagher and only female, Darcy.  Darcy is beautiful and has quite the singing voice, as do all of the Gallaghers.  I wonder if it doesn't go hand-in-hand with growing up working and owning an Irish pub.  Darcy wants to see the world and wants more out of life than what Ardmore can offer.  When wealthy American builder Trevor Magee comes to town, there is instant sparks between the two of them.<br /><br />It seems that Trevor's Irish roots have drawn him back to Ireland (or some say it's fate) and he wants to build a theater behind the Gallagher pub.  It's not an easy battle - the theater nor his attraction for Darcy, but Trevor decides that both are worth his time and energy.<br /><br />When Trevor hears Darcy sing, he's amazed and has his company offer her a recording contract.  It's everything she wants and will enable her to see the world, but at what costs?  She's torn between the music that has always been a special part of her life, and the man that she loves.<br /><br />But don't forget the three centuries old spell that needs to be broken in order for Carrick, Prince of the Faeries, to be able to claim his lost love, Gwen.  Carrick has two of the three requirements met and just needs Darcy to fall for Trevor in order to finally break the hex.<br /><br />The plot line is a simple romance, with a little made-up mythology thrown in.  The book is an easy read and enjoyable, but not without a few bumps along the way.  I found the scenes between Gwen and Trevor a bit more than I could handle.  It was very sugarcoated and make-believe type stuff.  Whereas the scenes in the first two novels were a little more believable, if you can believe in faeries and curses.<br /><br />When the story leaves Ardmore and has Darcy and Trevor traveling it took some of the charm away from the tale.  One thing that Nora Roberts does well is write about Ireland (read her Born In series to understand her love for the country and the Irish people) and she shouldn't try to deviate from it in a series about Ireland!<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed with the ending.  Not with the Darcy and Trevor ending, as anyone could predict that outcome, but with the faerie tale ending.  It was anticlimactic and I felt let down.  There were fireworks, of course, but I expect so much more.  After all, Carrick and Gwen had been apart for three hundred years - how about some sensual embraces or something!<br /><br />Overall it was enjoyable and not mind-boggling.

Anthony Hartstone recently inherited the island from his brother and uses it as a bargaining tool in getting a child labor bill passed through parliament.<br />Since the new owner, the Marquess of Camelbourne, requires several major renovations before he takes possession of the island, Anthony is stuck on Abandon until all work is completed.  In the meantime, Morweena is determined to change his mind about selling her homeland and uses all of the powers at her disposal.<br />With the right combination of humor and romance the story flows along carrying the reader on a peaceful and relaxing journey.  You can always count on Hunter's support characters to be interesting and colorful.  I haven't read a book by Jillian Hunter in which I didn't laugh out loud at some point during the story.  Abandon also holds true to this, with humor entwined throughout.  The sight of Morweena being chased down a hill by the local warlock, who casts spells on villagers for a price, is so hilarious that the reader can't help but chuckle.  Maybe I should tell you that the evil sorcerer is chasing Morweena because she threw rocks at him.  She threw them trying to save he released a puppy that he was planning to use in a spell.  A large rock hit him, allowing the puppy to escape his grasp.  Having the puppy running around growling and nipping at the heels of the warlock only added comedic fodder to the entire scene.  It was pure Jillian Hunter and a mental image that will remain with readers for a long time.<br />Although I enjoyed Abandon and found it to be a quick read, I was more fond of Indiscretion the book published prior to this one.  If you're in the mood for a few giggles, a heart-warming romance, and a mystery aspect that most people can figure out, then this is definitely the book for you to read, as are any of her previous novels.<br />Rumor has it that Jillian Hunter's next book is due out in August.  I can't wait!as pure Jillian Hunter and a mental image that will remain with readers for a long time.<br />Although I enjoyed Abandon and found it to be a quick read, I was more fond of Indiscretion the book published prior to this one.

As I finished The Face of Deception, I saw the synopsis of this book and realized the story of Eve Duncan continued.  I felt The Face of Deception didn't end very well, so I immediately started reading this book and I wasn't disappointed!<br />Iris Johansen shows her expertise in winding facts  along a journey of intrigue and shares a story that's shrouded in mystery.  As usual, Johansen introduces a strong cast of support characters, some old  friends and others new to us. Joe Quinn and John Logan are still on  opposite sides fighting for Eve's love; Eve still searches for her daughter  Bonnie. Introduced to Eve are Jane, a self-reliant 10-year-old girl who has  been in the system so long, she is bitter; Sarah Patrick and Monte, the  best cadaver search and rescue team in the field; a host of FBI agents; and  a newspaper reporter after the story of the century.<br />Johansen grabs the  reader from the beginning and won't release that hold until the last page.  At times I found my heart pounding, as my eyes raced along the words. Other  times, a sigh of understanding escaped.  If you don't mind losing a few  hours of sleep, this is definitely a &quot;must read&quot; for any avid  mystery fan!	2000-04-27

I love the depth in which Patricia Cornwell delves into her characters - we've seen Benton and Marino up close and personal, at their  best and at their worst, now it's our turn to see Lucy. As is her usual  approach, the characters are colorful and dramatic (can you see Pete Marino  in any other light?).<br />With this title, I wasn't sure what I was picking  up to read -- it gave me the mental image of a Frankenstein type book. The  Body Farm is actually a research facility in Tennessee where Scarpetta  discovers gruesome experiments that may lead to answering her questions and  to  finding Gault. So my original assessment from just the title wasn't too  far off base. With Cornwell writing it, you can be assured of a wild and  exciting ride.<br />Definitely a recommended addition to your Kay Scarpetta  library!	2000-04-26

Like so many romance writers today, in this tale Jillian Hunter crosses the genre lines into mystery without leaving the historical romance field behind.  She successfully blends the genres into a fun and exciting  adventure for the reader.  In my opinion, this is Jillian Hunter's best  book to date.  The real bonus for the reader is her typical comical  interactions between vivid characters.  You can actually see yourself or  people you know in many of these situations.<br />The story is of Anne Kerr,  who has never gotten over the scandal of a brief affair with Patrick  Sutherland before he left to fight with the infantry.  She was then quickly  married off to his cousin so her parents wouldn't have to deal with the  headstrong girl any longer.  Seven years later, Patrick and Anne are thrown  together by royal decree - they must investigate the mysterious death of an  uncle, with the help of Aunt Nellwyn, a widow who has outlasted several  husbands but will never overlook a good time.<br />The story is set at Anne's  hunting lodge with Patrick acting as her butler, which in itself brings  about many humorous situations.  One of the best things that Hunter brings  to her books is her vivacious characters and their amusing repartee.  She  has compelling women and romantic men who always seem to have battles of  wits throughout her books.<br />This tale will have you laughing your way  through as you try to figure out who the villain is that killed Uncle Edgar  and then on to the last page.  Indiscretion should be a definite addition  to your list of &quot;must read&quot; books!	2000-04-11
