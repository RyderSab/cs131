This book is too easy.  I bought this book so my daughter could get a jump start on first grade.  This is more like a review of kindergarden.  I think some kindergardeners might benefit from this book but it will be the ones who missed basic concepts.  A lot of this book is reviewing the sounds letters make. By the time my daughter finished kindergarden she could read as could most of her classmates.  The vocabulary words are all basic site words you should know in order to graduate from kindergarden.  The bottom line is if you are going to buy this book it means you are a caring parent who is concerned about your childs education.  If you are that kind of parent you will have undoubtedly worked with your child in the past and your child will be way beyond this material.  I am passing my copy onto a preschool child and am going to continue to look for something that will be challenging and teach my daughter something new.	2005-06-27

Teaching her to read has definitly not been &quot;easy&quot;.  I have actually not been this strung out teaching her something since toilet training.  But just like potting training, seeing my daughter read is extremely rewarding so I am going to keep on preservering even though sometimes I feel like giving up.  I would say my daughter was a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 when it came to being motivated to read.  Based on that and the reviews on this site I decided to order the reading lesson.  I also tried the first two lessons on their website for free and both my daughter and I found them to be easy and enjoyable.  Let me tell you, it is right at chapter three, the one they don't provide, that things get hard.  On the first day we did a lesson my daughter did all of chapter one in one sitting.  I thought that at that rate I would easily have her reading fluently by kindergarten.  Now we are at chapter 5 and it is literally a struggle to get her through two pages a sitting.  I have to bribe her with gummi bears and other asssorted goodies to get her through.  She can do the work but it is slow and requires a level of concentration she has never had to exhibit before.  I do think this is a good program but I just want everyone to know that your child will not learn to read in 20 easy lessons.  The book is 20 long chapters and it will take many, many lessons and a strong committment on the part of the parent for your child to learn to read.  I think it would be nice to have had a few more work sheets in the book to break up the lessons a little more.  I try to maintain my daughters interest by having her draw pictures next to the words she reads.  You can also have your child color the pictures in.  On the plus side the stories are as intresting as three and four letter word stories can be.  My daughter actually likes to read the little stories when we get into them to see what happens next.  The chapters are filled with lots of little animals which she enjoys immensly.  This is the only reading program I have tried and it is working but slowly.  One other point I would like to make is the book does not come with a cd rom.  I was a little confused about this until I got the book.  The cd rom is an additional $30 and I am seriously considering getting it to see if I can jump start the reading process a bit. My daughter loves the computer so this route my appeal a bit more to her than just the book.  I am going to stick with the book through the summer until the start of kindergarten.  It will be intresting to see if it clicks at some point and maybe goes a bit smoother.  At this point she has seen the word &quot;the&quot; it seems a hundred times and she still tries to sound it out.  At the end of every chapter is a list of sight words you are supposed to go over with your child until they have them memorized. Even though my daughter can sound out all the words in chapter 5 we are still on the previous chapters sight words.  Lastly one other thing I did do was supplement the reading lesson with the bob books.  They are enjoyable and also complemet the reading lesson well.	2004-03-26

I think this new book is the funniest yet. The story centers on our loveable trouble maker Duck who decides that he is tired of his chores.  In order to get out of his farm duties he decides to run for head of the farm.  Much to farmer Browns chagrin he is elected but when the job proves to be too much to handle he moves on to the governors office and finally the presidency. There are a ton of insider jokes about politics throughout the book that will go over the kids heads.  But that is exactly what makes it so fun for me to read.  One particularily funny part has Duck going on late night tv to play the saxophone ala Bill Clinton.  Also I am from Florida and there were a few jokes aimed at us relating to sticky ballots lost and close elections.  My four and a half year old daughter enjoyed the book because she loves Duck but most of the content was beyond her. The book is very timely now with the upcoming elections and I think most kids can gleam a little of the political process from it while anyone who can remember the past couple of presidential elections will find it hysterical.	2004-03-03

The story centers on little x this time.  He decidedes to run away because he is a letter that isn't used very much.  All of the other letters embark on an adventure to bring him home.  This book is especially perfect for this time of year.  There is a spooky castle and a monster M that evokes images of Halloween. At the end of the story little x realizes that he is a very special letter after all.  Children love the idea of a mystery and the illustrations in this book are really wonderful.  Everytime you read it you will see something new.  My daughter especially loves the page where the letters match up to an object that they begin with.  My daughter has learned a lot from this book and Alphabet Adventure.  I highly recommend them both.	2003-10-02

I bought this book for my three and a half year old daughter because it centers around a ballet loving girl (much like herself) and her cat (another great love of hers). The story is about Dolores who loves ballet so much that she tries to include her best friend Duncan the cat in her plans for attending tutu day at ballet school. Of course as anyone who knows anything about cats knows, cats do not like to be dressed up let alone in a ballet tutu. When Duncan decides to hide in order to avoid the dreaded tutu day it is up to Dolores the ballerina/dectective/pet psychotherapist to find him. Using all of her best locating skills she finally uncovers Duncan hiding under her bed just in time to accompany her to tutu day. Much to Duncans relief his attendance is that of a special guest rather than a participant. The underlying theme of this book is that is okay for best friends to not always like the same things. Dolores needed to respect the fact that cats do not like to perform ballet. I highly recommend this book. It is already a favorite in our house.	2003-05-23

The story centers around Little Rabbit who is having a birthday. As a special treat mommy and daddy rabbit pack up the family and take them to the Rabbit World amusemant park. Little Rabbit is very excited to go but his happiness turns to disappointment as he learns that he is too little to go on some of the rides that he wants. In his frustration he rushes ahead and gets seperated from the family. Once he is lost he realizes that he is not the big rabbit he thought he was. Of course Little Rabbit's mommy finds him and the book ends on a happy note as the family celebrates Little Rabbits birthday with a picnic and cake. This book really struck a chord with me because like Little Rabbits mommy I see my three year old daughter daily experience frustrations about being too little to do something. My daughters favorite expression to use is babies need help and big girls don't need help. She always says this to me whenever I try to assist her with one of her struggles. It is a constant challenge to make her realize that it is okay to accept help. Before I had a child I never realized how determined nad independent preschoolers can be. Both my daughter and I love to read this book together. The illustrations are so adorable. We especially love going over all of the rides at Rabbit World. I highly recommend this book to all parents of preschoolers.	2003-05-16

I bought this book for a gift but after looking through it I had to keep it for myself.  I would say that I am a medium level cook but I think the recipes are so easy and fool proof that even beginers will have success with them.  I usually do the bulk of my baking during the holidays.  So far I have made mainly the cookies from this book.  I was tired of having Christmas cookies that looked good but were lacking in taste.  This book has solved that problem for me.  For the last two years I have made all of my holiday baking from this book. The almond thumbprints with the milk chocolate ganache is out of this world.  Also excellent is the cherry and white chocolate rugelach.  I had never tried such a complex cookie before, you have to make a dough, roll it out and shape the cookie, but the results were outstanding.  The recipe for apple pie has become my standard Thanksgiving one. Best of all are the notes Lauren writes throughout the book.  You feel like you get to know her and her family.  Each chapter has an introduction to it so you know what equipment or special techniques you will need.  There are also confidence boosts as Lauren explains how easy it really is to make waffles, breads, cookies, etc.  I have always wanted to try making homemade pizza dough and Lauren's recipe is so straightfoward that I'm finally going to give it a try.  There are no pictures of finished products in this book but I didn't miss them in the least.  The recipes are all simple and straightfoward.  There is an emphasis on not needing to have special equipment or hard to find ingredients.  You probably own all of the equipment you need and all ingredients can be found in your local grocery store.  If you should ever want to go a more exoctic route, Lauren also provides an online resource guide so you can find real chocolate sprinkles or the perfect shape cookie cutter. Whenever I want to make a treat this is the first book I reach for.  I recommend it to everyone.	2003-01-06

The illustrations are gorgeous with lots of detail around the borders.  The are lush pictures of snow covered mountains, the northern lights, and a snug litle cabin.  If you are intrested in exposing your child to the Norwegian culture then the illustrations do an excellent job of that.  The story however is somewhat boring.  A boy shows up at a cottage with his polar bear looking for food and shelter.  The little girl who lives there tells him that there won't be any food because every year on Christmas eve a band of trolls comes down and devours all of the food. Sure enough they hear a knock at the door as the trolls arrive to collect their food. ...In short order the trolls consume all of the food. ... I was intrested in knowing if the story was perhaps a traditional Norwegian folktale.  Maybe something got lost in the translation.  There is no Information about this provided however there is a picture of the author on her trip to research the book.  The cover of the book would lead you to believe that the book is primarily about the polar bear but he has a minor role at the end.  I think the book would have been better if it would have provided some more details relating to how Norwegians celebrate Christmas.  Although this book has some worth while aspects to it you may want to read it over before you purchase it.	2002-12-16

My daughter received this book for her first Christmas and now three years later she still loves it.  The pictures are bright and cheery.  You can touch Santa's fluffy beard, press the reindeer's squishy nose, and feel the fuzzy fleece of the caroler's hat.  When my daughter was a baby I used to hold her on my lap and help her stroke the different textures.  Now that she is older she likes to take down several of the books in thuis series at a time and look through them herself.  The text is simple and the pictures are delightful. Best of all this is a well made sturdy book that will last for years to come.  I recommend it to everyone.	2002-12-10

I bought this book for my three year old daughter because like all little girls she loves castles and princesses.  Th book itself is very cute.  It is shaped like a castle with different levels and characters popping up such as a fairy kitty at the top.  The story itself is okay.  It is a very pared down telling of the story of sleeping beauty using cats as the characters.  The real star is the shape of the book itself.  My daughter never tires of looking through it on her own.  Best of all it is very sturdy and well made. I recommend this book to all	2002-12-10

I bought this book for my three year old daughter because we love Olive the other Reindeer so much. This book is in the same vein with similar quirky illustrations. My daughter can follow most books geared for 4+ years old but she lost intrest in this one about half way through. The story is a bit complex and presents some jokes that are above her head. For instance there is a play on words. The word wee is used to mean small as in wee people and to mean together as in we did it together. The story is primarily about Celerina the bunny and Gluey the snail. Gluey the snail lives in a house and takes care of it by repairing it when things break. Celerina the bunny moves into the house not knowing Gluey the snail lives there. The two peacefully coexist for awhile with Celerina unaware of Gluey's existance. Whenever Celerina breaks something Gluey repairs it for her during the night. Celerina decides it is magic and let's her friends destroy the house to the point where Gluey can no longer fix it. When Gluey first catches Clerina's atention she chucks him over a fence intio a garden before he can tell her it is he who fixes the house. The next time they meet and Celerina realizes her mistake it is too late and the house is beyond repair. Fortunately for Gluey and Celerina the wee people who orginally built the house work together to repair the house back to it's orginal splendor. There are a lot of lessons at work in the story. You should not rush to judgement about someone you have just met the way Celerina does with Gluey and team work gets things done as in the case with the wee people repairing the house. This book is a little complex for my daughter but I know that when she gets a little older she will love it. It was fun for me to read too. The book has wit, humor, and heart just like Olive the Other Reindeer. I think any four year old child or older will have no trouble following the story and enjoy it as much as I do.	2002-12-09

The story itself is nothing special.  It is a sweet little rhyme about dogs in space.  My three year old daughter is a real space buff since we visited the Kennedy Space center and I wouldn't say that she really learned anything new from this book.  The real star is the shape of the book itself.  It has all sorts of diecut figures such as an astrodaog and the earth popping out of the tops of the pages.  If your child is a reluctant reader I would highly recommend this book.  There aren't too many words on the page and it is very visually appealing. Bes of all it is sturdy. I was afraid that it would fall apart but there is no chance of that.  This book is well made.  I also purchased the castle book and my daughter enjoys looking through them often on her own.  I recommend them to all.	2002-12-09

Are you a busy parent who doesn't always have time when your preschooler wants you to play with them?  Then you will relate to Claude's mom as she tries to pull off a suprise party for Claude the polar bear.  Mom tries to direct Claude to various activities as she attempts to get ready but time goes slowly for Claude who only wants to spend time with his mommy.  Eventually Claude gets tired of waiting and when he decides that mom is so busy and she does not love him anymore he runs away to the garden.  A happy ending occurs when Claudes grandmother shows up for the party and Claude sees what his mother has really been up to.  Busy parents can relate to Claude's mom dilema of having things to do while wanting to spend time with their child while preschoolers can emphasize with Claudes impatience.  The illustrations are so adorable and wait till you see what Claude's mom fixes to eat at the party, yum!  A great story to enjoy with your child.  I recommend it to all.	2002-12-06

I agree with all of the other reviewers who say that the smells wear out fast.  After a week I could not longer detect any of the good smells such as bannnana, chocolate, or popcorn.  However my daughter does not seem to care.  She LOVES this book.  Actually she loves all of the bug books with a passion.  I don't really understand it myself but they make her happy so that is good enough for me.  Unfortunatly the one smell that still lasts is the dirty sock bug on the last page of the book.  It cracks her up to make us smell it and if we won't she chases us around the room with it.  Yes I am dissapointed that the smells no longer work but my three year old daughter still gets a kick out of the book so I guess that's what matters.	2002-12-06

The illustrations are so beautiful.  It makes me miss New England in the fall. There are pictures of Native Americans and Pilgrims working and playing with their family and friends.  This book was a great way for me to explain what Thanksgiving is all about to my young daughter.  This is the pefect book to read on Thanksgiving but it it so beautiful that you will want to enjoy it all year long.	2002-10-07

I never get tired of reading it to her unlike some of the other books we have.  The story is about a witch who wants to create the meanest most hideous creature ever.  Unfortunatly for the witch she forgets a key ingredient and ends up with Daisy, the cutest, sweetest girl in the whole.  No matter how the witch tries to turn Daisy into the mean creature she desires, Daisy finds a way to make the situation better and remain true to the sweet girl that she is.  How Daisy transforms Hiss the cat into Mr. Fluffy is particularily funny.  The ending of the book is very sweet and I think the book carries a great underlying message.  Keeping a positive attidue and a smile on your face can turn even terrible situations around.  Looking on the brighter side of things is a great way to go through life.  The witch theme makes it perfect for Halloween but the story is so great that you will want to read it year round.	2002-10-02

My 3 year old daughter and I really enjoy this book and the others in this series.  My daughter loves fire engines and this book is informative as well as fun.  The story begins with the fire engines waiting at the fire house.  The alarm bell sounds and the crew rushes off to fight a fire. As the story continues everything the fire crew does is explained in easy to understand terms.  I really liked the expanation of how the water is pulled from the ground through the fire hydrant to fight the fire.  After the resident of the house is rescued and the fire is extinguished, the crew goes back the fire house to clean up, take a break, and await the next fire.  The illustrations in this book are just okay.  The animals that make up the fire crew look a little strange to me but my daughter was able to identify what they were (bird, mouse, rabbit).  The best part of this book is the informative rhymes that make up the story.  Not too much information for a tired mom like me to read at night.  My daughter and I really like the the last page of the book that lists pictures of fire engine parts and equipment and their names.  Thanks to this book my daughter knows new words like water tank and pump and what they do.  My daughter asks me to read this book often and it has become a favorite.  If your child is really into fire engines and books about them check out the book Dot the Fire Dog.  It's another one we really enjoy.	2002-09-18

I bought this book for my three year old daughter because we both enjoyed Beware of the Bears by the same author.  This book is just okay.  We have read it a few times but it has not become a favorite.  The story revolves around Squeak the mouse who is being egged on by his sister to steal some chocolate cake from the kitchen.  Along the way Squeak thinks he sees the cat everywhere and in the end he finally meets the cat and conquers his fear of it.  The illustrations are cute but the story is not all that engaging.  I think there are better books out there for kids that deal with the issue of facing up to your fears.  I would rank this book more in the borrow from the library catagory as opposed to a must own book.	2002-09-16

We both love looking at all of the pictures of the places we have been to and the items and animals as the relate to the state of Florida. Each page features a letter, a rhyme even small children can follow, and a beautiful picture. There are also sidebars where more in depth information on the pictures is provided for more advanced readers. Our favorites are N for Nasa, S for St Augustine, and of course W for Walt Disney World. I foud the sidebar information okay in content. The letter U is for underwater Aquarium and I thought that maybe some info on the state aquarium in Tampa would have been nice if it was provided but it was not. On the other hand the page for the letter Z for Zebra Longwing butterfly mentioned Butterfly World an attraction that is located just down the street from us. I think the book would have benefited from some more in depth informnation on places you could specifically visit. That said I think the author did an amazing job of matching letters with Florida concepts. X is always a tricky one. I would recommend this book to any child who wants to learn more about the state of Florida and especially to children learning the alphabet who live in Florida. This book is a wonderful way to learn about our state.	2002-09-12

I bought this for my soon to be three year old daughter because she loves the other books in this series so much (if you give a mouse a cookie, a pig a pancake, etc.). I was glad to see mouse going to school.  I am currently trying to warm my daughter up to the idea of attending a preschool.  Thanks to mouse and his human boy friend school looks like a fun place to be. The boy in this story reminds me somewhat of myself. Always trying to satisfy the insatiable demands of a mouse or in my case the demands of a preschooler.  Parents and kids will enjoy reading this book together.

She really loves the books in this series.  Although she still likes her peg puzzles they no longer challenge her.  This book is the next step up of puzzle evolution.  Each page features a drawing of an animal with some mode of transportation broken into an easy 6 piece puzzle on the left side and a colorful picture of a child or children on the right.  At first my daughter needed a lot of help to put the puzzles together but as time goes by she needs less and less assistance.  The book is very sturdy cardboard but it may be a little difficult to fit the pieces together until the book has been broken in to a little bit.  After several uses the pieces seemed to fit in more easily.  The ryhmes are cute and overall I would say this is book is a great find.  I would have given it five stars if the puzzle pieces were a bit thicker but that is just nit picking.	2002-07-19

My main complaint about this book is the same one I have for Olivia's counting.  There are no new pictures of Olivia in this book.  All of the pictures come from Ian Falconer's previous two story books Olivia and Olivia at the Circus.  It seems like Mr. Falconer didn't feel like putting forth anything new for his two Olivia board books.  Anyone hoping to get a further glimpse into Olivia's personality will not find it here.  I am somewhat supprised that he chose to make  such a simple opposites book when the original Olivia storybooks are for more sophisticated.  That said the opposites are good simple ones that young children will understand for example up/down, quiet/loud, and my favorite plain/fancy (hadn't thought to teach my daughter that one).

My main complaint about this book is the same one I have for Olivia's counting.  There are no new pictures of Olivia in this book.  All of the pictures come from Ian Falconer's previous two story books Olivia and Olivia at the Circus.  It seems like Mr. Falconer didn't feel like putting forth anything new for his two Olivia board books.  Anyone hoping to get a further glimpse into Olivia's personality will not find it here.  That said the opposites are good simple ones that young children will understand for example up/down, quiet/loud, and my favorite plain/fancy (hadn't thought to teach my daughter that one).  I think that this book is best for very young children.  If your child is sophisticated enough to understand the two full length Olivia storybooks than there are better opposite books out there. Check out Chuck Murphy's Opposites if you have a preschooler.  It is an interactive experience.	2002-06-15

I read everything and a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts novel is like Shakespeare compared to this book.  I picked this book up because I loved Michael Chriton's Timeline so much.  I am facinated with the medieval ages and think the concept of someone from today's time comming in contact with the past is an intresting concept.  Unfortunately this book is not intresting in the least.  I went into the book really wanting to like it but the writing is so stiff and awkard.  The dialogue is not believable in the least.  The romance between Edward and Robyn which should be the focal point of the book is boring.  Edward is like a Ken doll, looks cute but is plastic with no personality.  I guess it doesn't matter in the end because he is not around for most of the story anyway.  If you read this book thinking you will learn something about the medieval ages you will be sorely dissappointed.  Edward doesn't talk like he's really from the medieval ages when he meets Robyn because it's a spell.  How convienent. The author didn't want to do in depth historical research so he uses spells to just explain everything away. I can't believe there are going to be two more books after this one.  If you want to read a wonderful book about the present meeting the medieval past get Timeline.  There is more action, romance, and historical accuracy in Time Line than you will ever find in Knight Errant.	2002-06-11
US	49266246	R1B2NR40VEDW2L	0689850875	302067756	Olivia Counts	Books	3	38	41	N	N	An okay counting book	I bought this book for my almost three year old daughter because she loves the two Olivia storybooks so much.  The pictures in this book are for the most part taken exactly from the previous story book Olivia.  The only two original pictures are Olivia's four aunts and eight cousins.  Unfortunately my daughter does not have aunts or cousins so she is not really familiar with these terms.  The other numbers are more easily recognizable items such as five books and six teeth.  I love Olivia, I really do, and I wanted to love this book.  The way Ian Falconer interjects culture such as art, ballet, and opera into his full length story of a pig and her family is really great.  I just get the feeling from this book that Mr. Falconer wanted to make some more money from his Olivia franchise without really having to create anything new.  One thing I have to say for the Olivia counting book is it's really sturdy.  This book would stand up to to the roughest toddler.  If you have an older child who is somewhat more gentle check out Chuck Murphy's One to Ten for an interactive and eye popping counting book.	2002-06-04

We have several potty books including the Bear in the Big Blue House one, Flush the Potty, Lift the Lid Use the Potty with stickers, Ruby's Potty  and the classic Once Upon a Potty: Girl just to name a few.  Although my daughter enjoys all of her potty books this is her all time favorite.  She really identifies with Caillou and his potty trials and tribulations.  The story starts with Caillou's mommy calling out to him that she has a suprise for him.  It's a potty!  Caillou doesn't know how to use it at first, he wears it as a hat.  After a few accidents he masters the potty and makes his mommy and daddy proud.  My daughter makes me read this book to her every day along with the book Caillou Takes a Bath.  I swear I have both books memorized word for word.  Although I am a little sick of reading them my daughter is less resistant to using the potty and taking a bath becauise of them.  If my daughter hesistates to use the potty all I have to say is let's do it like Caillou and that is enough to motivate her.  So where are we in terms of toliet training you might ask after all of these books not to mention countless videos, stickers, charts, and how to potty train books for mommy.  Well my daughter will be three in August and she has been peeing in the potty for some time now.  She will even get up by herself in the middle of the night and use the potty.  She still refuses to makie a bowel movement in the potty though.  I have to agree with Vicki Levines advice in a Girlfriend Guide to Toddlers.  If you need a potty training laugh her passage relating to this topic is a hoot.  She claims that your child will be toilet trained when they deem they are ready no matter how much you push and prod them otherwise.  Until that happy potty trained day comes you can pass the time with your little one reading good potty books such as Caillou Potty Time.	2002-05-29

It is her favorite holiday so we read this book year round.  The story is about a pig named John who is too scared to go trick or treating on Halloween with his friends.  John stays back at the house as his friends go on without him.  After they leave a real witch comes calling for some treats.  When she sees that John only has candy to hand out she decides to teach hime how to make some real Halloween treats.  They whip up such heavenly connoctions as pies, tarts, mousse, sundaes, and cookies.  All of the witch's monster friends show up for a real Halloween party.  Finally the witch tells John that they have to leave while it is still night out.  When John's pig friends come back cold and tired they are amazed to find all of the treats that John has prepared.  When John goes to bed he realizes he is no longer afraid of Halloween and he dreams of all of the new friends he has made.  The illustrations in this book are great and the story is really sweet.  My daughter loves this book and I really enjoy reading it to her.  This book will really put you into a Halloween mood.	2002-05-17
US	49266246	RFGIO99MASG6S	0764151126	317410847	A Cheese and Tomato Spider	Books	5	3	3	N	N	This book cracks us up	My almost three year old daughter and I love this book.  The pages are divided into two parts so that each page features one bold picture cut in half  of a spider, grandma, ice cream cone, etc....  You can mix and match the pages so you end up with silly combinations such as a strawberry flavored volcano or a birthday lemon.  The combinations are endless.  This book really keeps my daughter entertained.  Opposite the pictures are the phrases describing the pictures also cut in half.  On the top there is a descriptive phrase relating to the picture and the bottom features one word which tells you what the picture is such as cake, pizza, man.  I read the descriptive part \\"eek a wriggly\\"  and then encourage my daughter to try and fill in the one word part for example \\"ice cream\\".  I think she is starting to make the connection between the word on the page and the picture.  The other great thing about this book is it is sturdy.   The pages are well made and it has kind of a spiral notebook binding which makes it really easy to flip the pages.  I think this is a great book for keeping even the most atttention defecit toddler engaged in reading.	2002-05-14
US	49266246	R1HYAFL6K84FDK	0399233695	826818747	Car Wash	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great book for car wash enthusiasts!	My almost three year old daughter loves going to the car wash and she loves this book.  The simple story is about two kids and a parent who take their muddy car through the car wash.  As they go through the wash the kids imagine their car is a submarine and they have an underwater adventure.  They kids imagine they pass coral reefs, sea monsters, sharks, and a giant octupus.  Once the car is clean, the family goes out to lunch and then it's oh no! dirty car all over again.  The illustrations are done collage style using fabric, pearls, and buttons.  It's a very cute story and an easy read.  Whenever I am tired and my daughter is begging for a story I reach for this book.  There are very few words on the page so I can sit back, relax, and let her narrate the story for me.  We both really enjoy this book.	2002-05-13

I had even bought some of the Spider Books for my daughter even though she is really too young for them yet, just because I loved them so.  That is why I was particulary pleased to find Kirk's new Biddle series designed for pre schoolers.  In this sweet book a baby bunny gets tired of being squished in the nest with his brothers and sisters so he ventures out to explore the world.  Look for cameo appearances by Little Bird Biddle Bird and Miss Spider from Kirk's earlier books.  After Bunny has his adventure he decides that home is the best place to be after all.  The story really mirrors my own toddlers struggle to find the balance between independence while  still needing to have mommy near by.  The illustrations are adorable and I really don't mind reading it over and over which is a good thing since I am asked to read it several times a day.  I also like the length of the book.  It is just the perfect length to keep even an easily distracted toddler engaged.  All of the books in the Biddle series are excellent.  We also enjoy the new Little Miss Spider books which are also geared to the preschool set.  David Kirk is an excellent children's author and you will not be dissapointed with this book.	2002-05-13

My daughter learned so much about the ocean from that book and I thought Dem Bones would give her an introduction to the body.  The book follows an old African folk song called Dem Bones.  \\"The ankle bone is conneced to the foot bone, the foot bone is connected to the leg bone\\" and so on.  Since my daughter is so young I just sing the song to her and point out the bones on her body as we see the corresponding ones on the skeletons in the book.  If you have an older child there is much more in depth information about the bones provided on each page.  That is why I love Bob barner's books so much.  My daughter can follow along the simple to read stories now and when she gets older I can go over the more informative parts with her later.  She has already learned a great deal from this book and she really loves it.  Bob Barner really makes learning fun.	2002-05-13

I could not stop reading this book.  After reading this book I don't think it is a coincidence that the names Sante and Satan sound alike.  Sante Kimes is truly evil.  She had no problem stealing, swindiling, lying, and conning for every thing she has ever gotten.  One example of her scheming invloved insurance fraud.  It was not enough for her to rip off an insurance company.  When they handed her a check for a bogus claim she tried to keep the money instead of turning it over to the body shop where the car was at.  She tried to steal the car back without paying the body shop for the sound system that was put in so she would have a free sound system and the money from the fraudulant insurance check. Unbelievable!  And that was one of her milder schemes.  She also took illegal immigrants and kept them in inhumane conditions as slaves.   Soon fraud and slavery escalated into outright murder.  If Sante couldn't con someone into giving her what she wanted she would just outright eliminate them.  Her lack of remorse or any sign of a conscience is amazing.  As a mother I find it particulary appalling that she recriuted her own kids into her schemes.  She only paid attention to them when it suited her own needs.  It's a miracle that Kent, the author of this book, turned out to be the person that he is.  Sante's other son Kenny was not so fortunate.  The rest of his life will be spent in prison.  His life is virtually over at the age of 26.   I remember watching on Court TV when Kenny took the Court TV reporter hostage.  Kenny and Sante's bizare and outrageous behavior seems to have no end.  After reading this book I can't decide which was worse, to be considered their friend or their enemy.  Anyone who crossed paths with them in any capacity came out the worse for it.	2002-05-10

I knew absolutely nothing about investing but I felt that we were getting older and we needed to start thinking about saving for the future.  This book has opened up a new world to me.  We have very little money and I was scared to risk or needlessly spend what we do have.  This book has shown me how to secure our financial future.  Before this book I never even considered getting life insurance.  After reading this book, the first thing I did was go out and buy a term life policy so my daughter will be protected in case anything happens to my husband or myself.  My insurance agent was so impressed at what I knew about life insurance that he told me that 95% of the people he sold insurance to did not have my insurance buying knowledge.  I learned everything I knew about life insurance in 20 minutes from reading this book.  This book lays out in terms that anyone can understand how to protect your family and make your dreams come true.  Being a small business owner I especailly appreciated Davids advice for those of us who are self employed.  The best part of this book is the section that shows you do not have to be rich to save and invest.  Even those of us with modest incomes can achieve our financial goals.  It's all about make wise spending choices.  The wisest choice of all would be to buy this book!  I can't really say enough good things about it.  The only part missing for me was a section on investing for college.   I was looking for some advice on how to invest for my daughter's college education.  I also bought Suze Orman's book Road to Wealth and this topic is covered quite thoroughly in there.  Actually whenever I have a financial decision to make I read the topic in David's book and then follow up with Suze's for a second opinion.  They always seem to agree in their own ways and I feel like I am making the best decision I can to secure my family's financial future.	2002-05-10

This book follows the same formula as Click Clack Moo in that the animals get the upper hand on a human, in this case Bob. Bob does his best to follow what he thinks are Farmer's Brown's notes but they were really written by duck.  The animals have traded their typwriters in for pencils and now they are running poor Bob ragged.  With Duck doing the dictating bubble baths with Farmer Brown's good bubble bath and the movie the sound of Moosic are on the itenerary.  The giggle giggle quack in the title refers to the sound the animals make as they get their scheme over on Bob.  Of course all good things must come to an end. Farmer Brown catches on to what the animals are up to when he calls and duck answers the phone.  If you loved Click Clack Moo you will love this book.  Click Clack and Giggle Giggle are my two favorite books to read to my daughter.  I never get tired of reading them to her and she loves them just as much.  Even though the recommended reading age says 4+ my two and half year old daughter finds these books humerous and enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to everybody.	2002-05-07

This book is now a favorite of my two and half year old daughter.  She asks me to read it to her at least once a day.  The premise of the story is to show the proper way to say goodnight.  The first half of the book shows dinosaurs acting up at bedtime (hmm kind of reminds me of my daughter)  and the second part shows dinosaurs saying goodnight nicely.  The pictures of the dinosaurs really crack her up.  She loves the opening picture of the dinosaur in the tub and the one of the dinosaur holding a toy train.  The pictures are so charming that I am sure they will have adults smiling too.  The text is simple enough for a small child to memorize and the names of the dinosaurs are included on the page with their picture to provide even more learning oppurtunities.  This book has made my daughter so crazy for dinosaurs that I intend to take her to a dinosaur exhibit at our local science museum.  The best part of this book is that it has actually made my daughter go to bed with less resistance.  When she starts to act up I just quote a line or two from the book and she settles right down.  Last night she told me \\"goodnight mama dinosaur.\\"  We love this book.	2002-03-06

I have been reading it to my daughter since she was born and now that she is two and half she recites it with me. When she falls down she refers to it has going chicka chicka boom boom. We read this one anywhere from once to several times a day. This book belongs in every child's library but be forwarned. You will never get the chant out of your head.

The all time best alphabet book is Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.  This one is also excellent.  It is a bit more sophisticated than Chick Chicka but it engages my daughter all the same.  The premise of the story is that little i has lost her dot and all of the other letters of the alphabet embark on a trip to find it.  The really clever part of the book is all of the background illustrations.  For example there is a picture of a slide with the letter s sliding down it, the letter c is climbing, there are b's on a bridge.  Not only can your child learn the letter's but they can start to connect the letter's to words.  Every time I read this book I see something new. Your child can also help to find the i's dot on each part though this is rather difficult.  The dot is small and well hidden and in my opinion too hard to find.  My daughter only knows where it is from my pointing it out to her so many times.  I have one other small nit picky point. For the letter J they chose a jack o latern.  My daughter thinks of a jack o latern as a pumpkin which starts with p so it is confusing to her.  I wish they had choosen something a littleless open to interpertation for j.  An older child could understand that a jack o latern is a carved pumpkin but an older child would probably already know their abc's and not need this book.  Overall we love this book and the oppurtunities to teach your child from it are endless.	2002-01-15

Now that she is two she still periodically drags it out for me to read to her.  Each page features a different adult animal and baby animal kissing with a touch and feel component to the page. After I read the simple text on each page I lavish my own kisses on my daughter which makes her laugh.  This book gives you a great excuse (like you really need one) to kiss your own little one.	2001-12-20

She loves farm animals and there are lots of sturdy flaps for her to explore her.  Each page gives you three lift the flap clues to a farm animals identy and then on the opposite page you can lift a large flap to reveal the animal in question.  I like this book because it teaches more than just the animals name.  It gets your little one thinking about such questions as where the animal lives and what it eats.  The illustrations look like charming paintings.  This is a book both my daughter and I can love.	2001-12-20

Once I read it I had to have it for when she is older.  The story is wonderful.  A little girl discover her talent is raising Dragons.  I love the part where the dragon turns the corn field into popcorn with his fire breath.  We have a folkmanis dragon puppet that I intend to usein conjuction with this book when I will read it to my daughter in the future. Be warned that the family in this book uses a type of colloquel speech that is not proper English.  If the little girl was ever in an English class she would flunk (example &quot;t'aint rocks, Mother&quot;.)   If you are looking for a grammer lesson you might want to choose another book.  If you are looking for a delightful fantasy that encourages your child's imagination then you have found it.	2001-12-20

We don't watch Nickaloden so I am not all that familiar with Kipper but you don't have to know anything about him to enjoy this book.  Kipper and his friend Arnold the pig are adorable.  They guide the reader through the book as each letter of the alphabet is introduced.  Periodically a zebra pops up asking if it is his turn yet.  It is a clever story and a great learning tool.  We read it every day after the all time best alphabet book Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.  I don't want to push my daughter into learning the alphabet and these two books have allowed me to present it to her in a fun way.	2001-12-20

I bought this book for my two year old daughter because she was learning her colors and shapes.  I had bought other books from this author before and have been pleased.  The concept of this book is excellent.  As you flip each page the cut out shapes form a different (sometimes hard to recognize)animal. My daughter loved to call out the shapes and colors of each page. What I want to know is why they made this book out of such flimsy paper.  This book lasted one week before it started losing pages.  First the shapes started ripping at the edges and then we lost whole pages.  This book is geared for small children but they made it so that it will stand up to only the most delicate adult.  My daughter is not very aggressive, this is just a poorly made book.  Usually I don't mind if a book becomes tattered through a lot of love but for a book to last one week is just ridiculous.  The publishers should be ashamed of themselves!  Save your money and aggravation and buy shape books made of sturdy paper or coardboard.	2001-12-18

We read it every day along with Fish Wish by Bob Barner.  I believe that these two books have given my daughter a real appreciation of the ocean.  We love following the little girls adventure as she takes a trip the beach.  As we read the book my daughter and I go along with the motions of the little girl in the story. As the girl listens to the ocean in a shell, we pretend to listen also.  When she touches the sea we wriggle our toes as well.  When she smells the sea we sniff too.  This truly an interactive book.  My daughter loves naming all of the sea creatures in this book, the dolphin, starfish, jellyfish, etc.  It is simple enough for a two year old to follow and the pictures are sweet.  Our favorite picture is at the end of the book where the little girl asks if the sea dreams of her.  This book is a joy to read with your child.	2001-12-18

I thought that I would have to wait until she was older to share this amazing author/artist with her. That is why I was particularly pleased to find this book. It is perfect for her. She just learned to count to ten and she enjoys counting all of the animals in this simple to follow story. The illustrations are breathtaking. In addition to teaching counting there is an environmental lesson learned as the animals drink all of the water up and the rain replaces it. I can't wait to pair this book with the see and say geography toy my daughter is getting for Christmas. I am going to show her the animals in the book and then demonstrate where they are found on the sea and say. I think it will make for an excellent geography lesson. This is a beautiful book, you will not be dissapointed!	2001-12-18

By the way she loves all of the bug books in this series.  Check out Bugs that go Bump in the Night with the cool bug mask in the back.	2001-12-18

We have a lady bug handpuppet and I act out all of the ladybugs actions with the puppet as I read the book.  My daughter's favorite part is when the elephant sneezes aaaaaachooo!  It makes her laugh every time.  Unfortunatly this part of the book is a fold out page and I try to avoid buying books with them if it all possible.  Of course the page got ripped by an over entheusiastic toddler who just couldn't wait to get to her favorite part.  I taped it back together and while it bothers me that it is ripped it does not faze her in the least.  The story is delightful, the illustrations are sweet, and it makes my daughter laugh all of which makes this a winner.	2001-12-18

This is one of my favorite children's books (the other is the true story of the three little pigs which my two and half year old daughter is too young to sit through yet.)  I love the humor and never get tired of reading it to her.  I know the jokes go over her head but no matter, she loves the repetitive refrain of click clack moo and all of the farm animals.  Perhaps words such as ultimatum are a bit lofty for a children's book but I look foward to discussing it's meaning with my daughter one day.  It's great to have a new vocabulary words to learn instead of reading the same baby words over and over again. Although the vocabulary is a bit sophisticated, the plot of the story is simple enough for her to follow without losing intrest.  This is a book I reach for over and over again.  Can't wait for the new one!	2001-12-13

When I read the book I just change Dot to Duchess and she loves it.  She asks me to read it to her every day.  The text is simple enough for her to follow and she enjoys finding the dog on each page.  I think it is also good that the fire is not too scary and the part where the dog saves the kitten is really cute.  My daughter also has developed a love of fire engines (what kid doesn't love them)  so all in all I think she really enjoys this book. What bothers me is the illustrations.  The dog is okay but the people look like they were poorly drawn by grade schoolers. I find the androygenous faces kind of creepy.  It doesn't seem to bother my daughter though and I don't find annoying having to read this book over and over again to her.  I would have given this book five stars if it had better illustrations.	2001-12-12

She loves finding the orange fishy on each page as well as identifying all of his friends.  How many 2 years old know what a sea anemone is?  Well thanks to this book she does.  I am sure that this book will be the foundation of a life long love of the ocean.  I just hope that when she is grown there will be some coral reefs left for her to explore.  On a quick side note, if your child likes this book try I Saw the Sea and the Sea  Saw Me by Megan Montague Cash.  The two books are great when read together and will give your child a real appreciation for the creatures that inhabit our oceans.	2001-12-11
