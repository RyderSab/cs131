This was the first bead book I ever bought, recommended by bead artist Valerie Hector, and it got me on my way. Covering several of the basic bead stitches, the projects are gorgeous and will make you feel very successful when completed. The end chapter on combining stitches is a wonderful way to keep from feeling trapped with one style. <br />The only down side is that there are some basic bits of information not included that would have really been helpful when trying to go on your own. Still, worth having in your collection.	2003-08-19

Martha Stewart as a person, has received a ton of criticism, some founded and some not. Though not a diehard fan, I can appreciate her do-it-yourself approach to good living. I now have two Martha Stewart cookbooks.<br />This particular cookbook is the recipe compendium of all Martha Stewart Living issues for 2001, plus a few recipes from her special topic issues (weddings, baby, kids).  If you have every issue of the magazine, you'll not need this cookbook. For the rest of you, read on.<br />Chapters represent each month's issue, and along with the featured recipes for the month, include recipes from the regular columns: Dessert of the Month, Good Things, What To Have For Dinner, and Fit to Eat.<br />Browsing through this cookbook is like walking through a buffet. You'll find a varied assortment of dishes that will please just about everyone; from the basics like \\"Spaghetti and Tomato Sauce 101\\" to more elaborate meals like \\"Beef Rendang with Broccoli\\". Regardless of the recipe, I found each recipe clearly written and easy to follow.<br />My first experience with this cookbook was not something simple and safe. Oh no, I had to pick something that required time, patience, and steady nerves. I selected to make \\"Alma Etheridge Wilson's Roanoke Sixteen-Layer Chocolate Fudge Cake\\". If you ever see this cookbook, a slice of this particular cake appears on the cover.<br />Making this cake also required breaking in my new KitchenAid stand mixer. The sweat broke out on my forehead with the thought. What had I gotten myself into?<br />The only secret to this fun (yes, I said fun) cake is to follow the directions. No matter how much you want to, do not over bake it. Each layer is so thin that it will dry out or burn before you know it. The only thing missing from this recipe is an estimated time of completion. I made the mistake of starting the cake after dinner and didn't finish until sometime after midnight. The results were worth it. A delicious and gorgeous cake that had everyone wondering how I did it.<br />Another recipe that was a knockout was for \\"French Onion Soup\\". I've never had it, never wanted to try it, and turned my nose up at it if offered. I'm not a major fan of onions. I selected this particular recipe because my fiance said he liked it and I wanted to add another \\"new food/dish I've tried\\" to my growing list. For anyone who has never had French Onion Soup, unless you are allergic to onions or cheese, you must try this recipe! For those who love French Onion Soup but were afraid to make it thinking it might be too difficult, try this recipe.<br />The hardest thing about this recipe is having patience to not stir the onions too often while waiting for them to caramelize. I made this over the weekend and after my first taste, wanted the whole pot for myself. This is one of those recipes that are so simple, whether you make your own beef broth or use canned, you'll want to make it often.<br />I have to say that I went into this cookbook ready to find all sorts of faults with it and I couldn't. Well, I did run into a few silly editing mistakes. Small things like in the index, Pork is shown as a sub-category for Poppy-Seed. It was frustrating initially looking for a recipe using pork until I noticed the mistake.<br />As for who would enjoy this cookbook? Just about anybody looking for recipes they can be successful using, for anyone looking for a variety of recipes to suite family and friends, for those who enjoy good cooking. The few mistakes I found were easy to overlook but still tarnish the shine of this cookbook. Not bad Martha, not bad.worth it.

Honest! Through very achievable recipes, several unusual techniques, and some of the most comical photos youll ever set your eyes on, he demonstrates that cooking doesn't have to be a chore. All this without using bizarre ingredients or equipment, Ok, a dishwasher might be construed as bizarre. Hey! People once thought deep-frying a turkey was weird and now look.<br />I'm still working up the nerve to try &quot;Dishwasher Salmon with Piquant Dill Sauce&quot; but I can swear by &quot;Brown-Bagged Lemon-Tarragon Chicken with Capers&quot;. His paper bag technique may just replace the need for expensive parchment paper. I don't like  creamed vegetables but &quot;(I Can't Believe It's Not) Creamed Corn&quot; from &quot;Slammin' Salmon Extravaganza&quot; is a keeper especially now that corn is in season. It is pure creamy sweet goodness.<br />There may be a lifted recipe or two in the &quot;Extreme Cuisine&quot; chapter but that's one chapter and there's so much more to this book.	2001-08-13

Though the recipe makes 10-12 bones, I only ended up with 8 to show for my efforts. This probably had something to do with my desire to sample a few to make sure they were up to my strict standards. I couldnt help it. They were good!<br />These are delicious and fun recipes. They are well thought out though some of them could do with better instructions. By trying to be simplistic, a few recipes sometimes leave out what may seem like obvious steps or are not as descriptive as they could be.	2001-08-02

Recipes are highly detailed but do not let this intimidate you. Each step takes you carefully from preparation to plating. Ingredients are list three ways: by volume, ounce, and in grams. Not only is the appropriate bakeware to use listed but this book also shows a picture of it to remove any doubt.<br />Beyond the recipe you'll find variations, storage information, pointers for success, and what she call's \\"understanding\\". These understanding notes may explain why an ingredient was handled in a certain way or a particular cooking technique was used. For insteance, in the recipe for \\"Peaches and Cream Tart\\" she explains that the acid in the peach juices keeps the custard from curdling at the higher than usual baking temperature.<br />I am not a pastry maker. I don't pretend to be. With this cookbook however, I not only felt confident, I felt more knowledgeable about the subject. It felt like each recipe I tried was another lesson in the art of pastry making. Rather than just following a recipe, I gained experience that I  can use in the future. <br />This is one of those books that will definitely get filthy with repeated use. That's the greatest compliment that can be shown a cookbook and its author.	2001-08-02

The recipes were not incorrectly written or missing steps, it was the overall outcome. \\"Almost Fat-Free Cornbread\\" had a neat rustic look, but was dry and had a bitter taste that had to be drowned out by butter, defeating the purpose of being almost fat-free. I could tell that \\"Southwestern Hominy Stew\\" was going to be bland long before it was even finished. There just weren't enough spices used to enhance the broth and combat the starchiness that seemed to overpower. Even the freshly roasted peppers couldn't help this sad soup out. <br />Interspersed throughout the book, there are few redeeming recipes. The \\"Spring Vegetable Paella\\" is delicious and leaves room for experimentation. Make sure you use quality ingredients and don't skip the saffron or you'll be disappointed. The \\"Cassoulet\\" would be just another recipe for vegetarian baked beans if not for the use of the flavored seitan. It gives just enough \\"meaty\\" flavor to bear a resemblance to the classic French dish.<br />Overall, I doubt I'll use this cookbook very often. Low-fat vegetarian in this case is an oxymoron. If you are a vegetarian who is worried about fat may find this a useful cookbook. For those who want more flavor, consider one of the other fine Moosewood Restaurant cookbooks.	2001-07-03

Each recipe was rich and tasty and leftovers, when there were any, made great lunches the next day. I loved the way my kitchen smelled!<br />\\"Black Bean &amp; Chipotle Soup\\" was spicy and delicious. \\"North African Couscous Salad\\" was more filling than I expected and had a very exotic flavor. Even served at room temperature, the flavors were strong and tasty. This would make a great picnic salad. If you're a vegetarian who likes to entertain, many of these dishes will satisfy meat eating guests, and they'll probably not even notice.<br />These are year round recipes that I look forward making whenever I want something a little different yet satisfying. Vegetarian or not, I think most people will enjoy this cookbook.	2001-07-03

Fiery food lover. Cookbook author. Vegetarian. You might think you just fell down the rabbit hole, but after tasting his creations you`d know everything was going to be all right. His tongue-in-cheek cookbook will satisfy anyone who loves spicy foods, and vegetarians who want a change. <br />If you like spicy or downright hot foods, you'll get a kick out of this cookbook (pun intended). Flavors are bold and the body of recipes varied. Of course you'll find the standard hot items like stuffed jalapeno peppers and chili pie but there are lots of surprises to be found here as well. <br />For pasta fans, try \\"Mean Bean Meatballs\\" on top of your next plate of spaghetti. Vegetarians should try \\"Scrambled Beyond Belief\\", which uses extra-firm bean curd and chipotle peppers, for breakfast. Need an exciting side dish? Make \\"Devilish Pumpkin Fries\\" and watch everyone's eyes light up.<br />One of my most favorite recipes from this cookbook that I've made many times since, with and without the fire, are his \\"Chocolate Killer Cookies\\". This is a great and easy to prepare chocolate cookie recipe. I've made them with white chocolate chips as called for but found my favorite way is to use peanut butter chips instead. The recipe only makes 24 cookies and they will not last long. When using the cayenne pepper, they remind me of very good quality ginger snaps. Just enough bite to make your mouth tingle but not enough to make you stop eating.<br />For such an extraordinary cookbook it's a shame that there is no measurement given for how hot a recipe is. Something as simple as giving a mild, medium, or real hot rating for each recipe would be a major help. \\"Righteous Rotelle\\" had enough heat to make you sweat, while \\"Chipotle Cheese Soup\\" was just smoky and belly warming. <br />When making a few recipes I needed to make a few adjustments, which could be due to bad testing or differences in equipment. I shortened the boiling time for the asparagus in \\"Asparagus a la Dante\\" as in my first attempt they came out a bit limp after they where fried. Regardless, they were addictive.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this cookbook regardless of a few annoyances and can hardly wait to try other recipes. Tonight though, I'm making more cookies!	2001-07-03

I compared my copy to both older and newer copies and noticed how much it's changed over the years. The newer books contain recipes that reflect the more health conscious times of today. I know several people who refuse to give up their food stained older editions because they contain \\"old stand-bys\\" which were phased out of the newer editions. <br />I've turned to my copy on many occasions to find a childhood favorite dish, or to look for ways to prepare a particular ingredient I had a taste for. I've found that simpler was better when judging successes. The more unusual dishes didn't tend to fair well. One stir-fry dish tried I can guarantee used far too much cornstarch for thickening. The sauce became a paste almost instantly when the cornstarch slurry was added and nearly solidified as it cooled. More straightforward dishes, such as \\"Oven-Fried Chicken with Parmesan Cheese\\", turned out as good as it sounded. This is not to say that all unusual recipes don't work. It's just that on many occasions, the more unusual the recipe, the more work I had to put into it to make sure it came out right.<br />This is one of those books that you have to have. For its tried and true recipes as well as its abundance of information on just about everything food related. It would make a great addition to the novice cook's arsenal. Even those who regularly cook without a recipe may find some interesting ideas within. \\"The New Joy of Cooking\\" isn't perfect but it is close enough.	2001-07-03

Mrs. Ojakangas talks about pot pies being international yet the majority of her recipes had a French flair to them. Personally, these are recipes I'd expect in Bon Appetit, they are not your everyday family fare. Many recipes require a large number of ingredients. Many you will be hard pressed to find in your local store.<br />I did find it a bit difficult to prepare many of her recipes after coming home from work. Though it can be done, it does mean eating late in some cases. If you're short on time, wait to try most of these recipes on the weekend.<br />Though I can't see myself picking up this cookbook often, these are recipes that are great for casual company, brunches, and garden parties. If you like European home-style cuisine, you'll enjoy this cookbook. If you are looking for simple meat and potato recipes, move on.	2001-07-03

Following the classic old road from Illinois to California, she visits the kitchens of inns, restaurants, community cookbooks, and residents who provide memories along with regional tastes. <br />For as interesting a concept as this cookbook is, it's a shame that it has as many editing errors as it does. One can overlook the occasional odd terminology used in the ingredients lists (soda instead of baking soda), and the few rather large portion sizes (the recipe for \\"Mustard Relish\\" makes 9 pints). But it is unacceptable to have ingredients called for that are not used and exact ingredient sizes not given.<br />The recipe for \\"Chorizo Roll\\" asks for 4 links Mexican Chorizo Sausage but doesn't tell you how much that would be in ounces or pounds. I've seen these links come as large as Italian sausage links and as small as breakfast sausage links. It makes a big difference. The recipe for \\"Paper Bag Apple Pie\\" lists a 9-inch unbaked pie shell twice, once for the pie and once again for the topping. I double-checked the recipe and the second pie shell was definitely an accidental listing. In the same recipe, though this is probably obvious to some, the ingredients list calls for 6 baking apples but doesn't list a preparation for them (diced, sliced, chopped, etc...). It's not until you get into the description does it mention that the seasoning mixture is to be sprinkled over sliced apples. <br />Of the recipes I tried, each turned out delicious and satisfying, after a few adjustments. Making \\"Strawberry Muffins\\" doesn't get any easier and they are not too sweet to serve as a snack or along with breakfast. Though I had to substitute a similar local white wine for the regional one called for in \\"Chicken and Rice in Wine\\", the dish smelled heavenly and had a very pleasing taste.<br />The abundance of recipes and travel information warrants the price tag but the mistakes make you want to ask for a discount. If you are curious about traveling along Route 66 yourself someday, you might find some fun recipes to try out or look into tasting straight from the source. In general though, it asks for more bang for the buck than it delivers.	2001-07-03

He's stepped on a rake that sends \\"Mr. Toughness\\" flying. \\"Mr. Toughness\\" bares an uncanny resemblance to Adolph Hitler. The ad reads \\"Lettuce beet the axis!\\"- Says the 5 Crowns.<br />There were some surprises and some disappointments when working through the recipes. I find that a well done \\"7&amp;7\\" can be very tasty. I didn't know that it was considered a Highball. Another drink tried used fresh cream and maraschino liqueur. This turned out to be disgusting as the cream curdled on impact. I don't know if this was supposed to happen but it was quickly poured down the sink. After a bit of experimenting with measurements, I found the \\"Aviation\\" likened to a Sour and very good. <br />This is not the end-all and be-all of cocktail books. They list several sources in the bibliography should you thirst for more. I consulted a few of these and found a number of discrepancies. Some drinks in \\"Vintage Cocktails\\" used different alcohols; others were older than listed. If you desire accuracy, this could pose a problem.<br />If you are a cocktail drinker, you will find several new ones to try as well as original recipes for some of your favorites.

If you have a small can of plain pumpkin puree, you probably have everything to make these tasty muffins. This recipe was easy to prepare and resulted in a flavorful muffin.

Not only will you find loads of goodies to make but also you'll enjoy reading through it. From the B&amp;W photos of diner scenes are sprinkled throughout the book to the witty chapter names. Be sure to notice the clever page numbering done in monetary units. For example, the S'more Sundae recipe starts on page $1.64.<br />Chocolate Cream Pie was absolutely wondrous. You won't be able to eat a lot of it in one sitting because it's so rich but you'll still find yourself making excuses to have another slice whenever you can. The only hiccup I had was during the bubble stage. It's not exactly clear from her instructions what you should look for to know when the chocolate mixture should come off the stove. You are told that when you see bubbles you should cook for another minute then pull the saucepan off the stove. Much later in the instructions she mentions that you should be dealing with pudding at this point. When I reached bubble stage and then stirred for another minute, I still had chocolate milk.<br />Another recipe that had some problems was with her Chocolate Cheesecake Bars. Though I bake these interesting bars for 70 to 75 minutes at 300 degrees, it was still close to raw mixture. An additional 10 minutes helped stiffen it up but it could have easily gone and extra 20 minutes or so before I think it would be truly ready. The problem is by cooking so long, the cheesecake topping starts to brown just past comfortable. As for taste, I'm not familiar with this dessert so I'm not sure. It was tasty but I was surprised at how less sweet it was compared to the ingredients used. <br />All in all, I was pleased with the recipes created from this cookbook. If you enjoy making old-fashioned sweets, you'll find plenty to choose from here.	2001-07-03

My style of cooking is casual while what I saw fell in the realm of chic plated fare. To my delight, Mrs. Walters and the retreat chefs have converted their goodies into achievable recipes for the home cook. Except for the rare use of an unusual ingredient like elk loin, the only other consideration is time. A few of the items, especially from the dinner menus, may take awhile to prepare. Caramelizing the onions for \\"Spicy Meatloaf with Caramelized Onions' takes an hour but the results are more than worth it.

You want to serve your family a nutritious meal but the children only want burgers and fries. Your son drowns everything on his plate in ketchup and your daughter gets chronic stomachaches. They eat too much or absolutely nothing. What in the world do you do? Leanne Ely, C.N.C., nutritionist, had problems feeding her children and was determined to find out how to help them and herself.<br />\\"Healthy Foods\\" is filled with easy to digest information on nutrition that suites the needs of children as well as adults. She doesn't try to sell you on a new diet or product that doesn't work. Instead, she provides clear facts along with her own opinions and observations, which are clearly labeled as such. She provides lots of useful links to websites with dietary information for further research. In her playful way, she also provides tips to get your kids to try new foods. How about cutting up food and letting your child pick up the pieces with toothpicks? <br />Mrs. Ely has come up with over 100 family tested recipes to choose from. These recipes are designed to be un-intimidating and good for you. Everything from snacks to breakfast, lunch, and dinner are covered. Recipes are very simply and use easy to find ingredients, though you may need to go to a health or natural food store for some. Some may take offense to the occasional use of processed foods used here and there but they are kept to a minimum and they are the more health conscious varieties.<br />I don't have children but I do want to eat right. I also have days were I don't want to cook anything too adventurous. I was impressed with the quality of the information she provided and in the way it was presented. Her guidelines are just that, \\"guide\\" lines. You need to make the necessary adjustments to suite your family's lifestyle and needs.<br />It was fun picking out recipes to try, especially since many recipes had funny titles such as Not Your Mama's Tuna Casserole, Poor Tater Supper, and Pumpkin Mumkins. I foundseveral recipes I was already familiar with and others with a new twist. Recipes are easily adaptable to what you have on hand and geared towards experimentation. \\"Fast and Furious Chicken and Rice\\" has been transformed numerous times depending on my refrigerator's contents. I've substituted cooked ground chicken for chicken breasts and put taco cheese on top. On one occasion I added frozen vegetables and a couple of shots of Tabasco.<br />One of my favorite breakfasts, especially now that the weather's warming up, has become her \\"Smoothie Patrol\\". It beats a Slim-Fast shake any day, and I can make any flavor I want. If you have kids, here's one they'll never guess is good for them.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this cookbook and will refer to it many times. I have already suggested it to several friends at work who have small children that are problem eaters. If I had to force myself to find a problem it would be that occasionally there is a recipe that is too tame for my taste buds. Here and there I would add a dash of spice to punch it up a bit. <br />I think that regardless of age, this cookbook would find a good home in anyone's kitchen. From college students to those more mature in age, this is a very useable cookbook indeed.	2001-06-19

Any excuse to buy another soup cookbook is a good one for me. The large words &quot;Italian Soup&quot; written across the cover was all it took for this one to end up in my shopping bag. Recipes range from amazingly simple to time consuming but worth the work. These are recipes that you'd expect to have passed down lovingly, with each recipient making it their own along the way.<br />There are no pictures in this cookbook but the descriptions do the recipes justice all on their own. Each recipe is listed by its English name, its Italian name shown underneath. Chapter titles, listed English over Italian, appear only in Italian on each page header. For visuals, a decorative green strip borders the page edges and there are drawings done in orange interspersed throughout. A very well done index is also provided at the end of the cookbook.<br />The \\"Sautéed Asparagus Soup\\" is a super simple soup that contains so few ingredients you wonder how it could possibly be any good. But it is! I found myself making it whenever I was short on time and ideas. Like most soups, it reheats well and tastes even better the next day. For the most part, soups contained here can be made in under an hour (after preparation of ingredients). <br />\\"Pasta and Beans with Fennel and Sausage\\" is great when company's coming and you don't want to have to fix a lot of food. A nice salad served along side this rich and filling soup and you'll elicit compliments and requests for seconds.<br />Soup is typical considered a great food for dieters though with these recipes, I would suggest going over the ingredients lists carefully. Many ask for a good helping of cheese in or on top of. Some use bread, rice, or potatoes as thickeners, the meat-based soups use fairly fatty meats, and butter is used most often to cook in.<br />If you are looking for meal type soups, miss your grandmother's Old Country cooking, or just enjoy soups like I do, this is a not to be missed cookbook. You can turn to any page and feel comfortable that the results will be fantastic.	2001-06-19

This massive, information packed tome covers just about everything someone would want to know about non-meat cooking. Not just a book of recipes, she shares techniques and other useful information written simply so that any level cook can understand.<br />There are lots of basic recipes for the hesitant as well as more complex  (yet still doable) recipes for those wanting to explore. I found most recipes to be short and simply to prepare, allowing the flavor of the main ingredient or the style of preparation to shine through. The &quot;Braised Carrots&quot; are simply and very delicious!<br />The layout is not exactly easy to follow at first glance. You can scan the table of contents or simply flip through the book to locate an interesting recipe, but if you are looking for a specific ingredient or preparation technique to use, turn to the index instead.	2001-03-13

After a few minutes baking, the whole place smelled like a wonderful lemony bakery. I took the cake out of its pan, let it cool, and after painfully waiting, cut myself a slice. Let's just say that there were no crumbs left. <br />The tips and other helpful information are well worth the read. Some though, would make a great appendix or given as tables in the front of the book. I've since put colored index tabs in my book to mark the really useful ones, like pan size conversions and tips for baking cookies. <br />One feature of this cookbook I really like is its use of a color photo listing of every recipe. I can scan through and pick out a cake that not only sounds tempting put looks tempting. I found all of her helpful hints just that, helpful. Another very thoughtful feature is in the back of the book. An entire page of conversion tables! These cover liquids (US, Imperial and metric), oven temperatures (Fahrenheit, Gas Mark and Celsius), weights (US/UK and Metric), and a few approximate equivalents for things like granulated sugar, egg yokes, honey and such.	2001-03-13

I belong to a cookbook club and forgot to tell them I didn't want that month's selection. I've been able to prepare many of Mrs. Woods' recipes with great success. The tuna croquettes are very easy and delicious! They reheated well for lunch the next day too. The smothered pork chops are to die for, and I finally can make gravy my grand mother would have been proud of!<br />The only trouble I ran into in the entire cookbook were several of her cooking times. In a few recipes, like the &quot;Wednesday Night Special Meat Loaf&quot;, cooking took noticeably longer than specified. I know all ovens are different but when the recipe says bake for 1 hour and it took almost 2, that's a big difference. Still, the meat loaf was delicious and worth the wait. <br />Along with some great recipes, if you enjoy reading your cookbooks, you'll spend lots of engrossed in this one. This cookbook is a human-interest biography with lots of humor and soul.	2001-03-12

I had to admit that I had a back up plan ready just in case. I'm happy to say I didn't have to use it. The combination of Italian sausages, seedless grapes, and Balsamic vinegar created a very unique taste that I enjoyed. <br />That is a factor to consider when approaching this cookbook. Many recipes are simply not for everyone. If you have a die-hard tomato sauce on spaghetti crowd, you may have tough time getting them to try &quot;Ziti with Butter, Sage and Parmesan&quot;. If you have adventurous eaters however, you're in luck.<br />His &quot;With MINIMAL Effort&quot; section that ended each recipe easily tripled the number of recipes you can create in this book. Don't like an ingredient, look through his list of alternatives. Something as simple as using garlic instead of ginger created a whole new taste sensation for his &quot;Steak with Butter and Ginger Sauce&quot; recipe. Who needs A1?<br />You'll find yourself getting excited while using this cookbook. If you're a novice who wants to expand their horizons, you'll find lots of room to grow. For those who are hold hands in the kitchen, you'll find lots of reasons to let loose and play.	2001-03-12

Delicious! Every recipe tried was well seasoned and was what I'd call an &quot;eager to repeat winner&quot;, if you don't mind fighting past all the errors.<br />In &quot;Couscous Fritters&quot;, the instructions you're supposed to turn to page 20 for her technique on how to peel and seed tomatoes. There is nothing about tomatoes on page 20. It's really page 22. The recipe calls for 2/3 cup broth, but what kind? Step 1 puts all the ingredients for the salsa together while in step 2 you are asked to prepare the fritters. Among the ingredients you're supposed to mix together is the &quot;remaining salt&quot;. What remaining salt? You used it all in step 1 for the salsa. I think she meant the cumin.<br />Recipes are well thought up but somehow, either the test kitchen or the editors goofed. If you are someone who really needs recipes to be right, skip this book. You'll pull your hair out trying to figure out what's wrong. If you can work around the mistakes and really want to try couscous, you'll find some really tasty meals in here. My copy has lots of notes and cross-outs. I'm sure yours will too.	2001-03-12

I can only imagine this one grilled. <br />The recipe for &quot;Green Beans with Meat&quot; is amazing, and uses such a small amount of meat that vegetarians could leave it out and not heavily affect the taste. Whether served as a main dish over rice or as a side dish, this is one that will appear on my table often.<br />The only weakness I found was that which the book focused on, simplicity. I longed for further ways to serve falafel beyond the simple &quot;put in pita&quot; listed on the box. Kibbee can be served raw, fried, or baked. It can be stuffed with meat or served plain. In some cases however, the differences were so slight they would have been better listed as variations.<br />This book accomplishes its goal. By giving you simple recipes for Lebanese foods that we are familiar with, she ensures that the cuisine lives on. This is an especially appealing book for those who are concerned about their diets or are vegetarians looking for food that is not only good for you but taste good too.	2001-03-12

It's friendly writing style kept me interested while learning about the wide world of seafood though.<br />On the whole, this is a delightful book for anyone who wants to add more seafood to their diet. Where it lacks is on subjects that would make a good addition to the appendix. Substitutions are probably the one area I wish they covered more thoroughly. A table is listed in chapter 1 that does give you a good idea of which fish have the same texture. This comes in handy when selecting a fish that needs to stand-up to grilling or other types of handling. As for taste, I know you should always experiment and discover tastes of your own, but a table mentioning which fish were similar in taste would have been nice. Certain fish do mention in their individual descriptions what they can be substituted for but this is not always the case. I found the mention for substituting Tilapia for Snapper under the Tilapia description but not visa versa. <br />If you enjoy seafood and want to make it regularly at home, this is a good book to get you started. It's an enjoyable read with truly useful information.	2001-03-12

After flipping through the book, I had my doubts.<br />Every recipe I tried was delicious. My favorite recipe has to be his &quot;Chocolate Cornflakes&quot;. Delicious and fun to make.<br />Things I noticed about these recipes: They seem designed for parties and less for home cooking. Yields were large, with servings for 8 seeming to be the magic number. If you want to impress, you'll love this book. There is a fair amount ingredients that may be hard to find. <br />To recreate many of the recipes listed will require: time, talent, and a little prayer to pull off. This is not to say that the results aren't worth it. Desserts like the impressive &quot;Nougatine Basket with Fruit Sorbets&quot; (three diamonds) can be accomplished, you simply have to take your time and be prepared.<br />If you've ever looked at an issue of &quot;Chocolatier&quot; or &quot;Pastry: Art &amp; Design&quot; magazines, you have a good idea of what you'll be in for with this cookbook. Cooks looking for a challenge will find plenty of recipes to choose from.	2001-03-12

When I received this book, I wasn't entirely sure what to think. The &quot;Goddess&quot; reference made me pause. I have my own beliefs and wasn't sure if I could swallow what she was going to say. To my delight and surprise, she's not out to convert anyone. For the most part, the Goddess references are meant to be about you, the cook. Other references are lightly sprinkled throughout the book and make for an interesting read, especially the festival menu section.<br />As for her recipes, she knows her food. Many of the recipes I tried were hits without any adjustment from me. What a treat to find really flavorful vegetarian recipes. She leaves lots of room to make her recipes your own. For instance, though her Peanut Soup was a big hit, I wrote in the &quot;Notes&quot; section, next time I'd run the soup through a blender and add some red pepper flakes and/or ginger to add a kick.<br />I found her recipes quick to prepare. The majority of her recipes could be ready in under an hour. She pairs interesting ingredients together and darn if they don't work. These are company worthy recipes that even kids would love.	2001-03-12

I did find it interesting to note the number of recipes that required alcohol. Not a large amount, but still a far number, especially if you plan on making any of these for children. <br />I found that the super simple, such as Grilled Pound Cake with  Nectarines, were truly done in a flash and tasted every bit as good as they looked. Something like this could be made for a small party without the host or hostess being gone for too long. As recipes got more involved, the taste remained good but not all results were exactly as expected.<br />Was Mrs. Barnard successful in her objective? For the most part I think she did. The recipes were scrumptious and as the book is titled, sophisticated. If you're looking for easy yet impressive desserts to make for dinner guests, I think you'll find plenty to choose from. Read the instructions carefully and give yourself a little extra time just in case.	2000-12-31

After I bought this cookbook, it sat on my shelf for a few months before I got around to looking through it. I was surprised to find out just how much information it contained and how appropriate it is for these busy times. Written in a friendly and conversational tone, Mrs. Anderson uses examples of her own life and cooking needs to show how she's created her techniques.<br />Her book is full of common sense and fun in the kitchen. Does \\"How to Cook Without a Book\\" accomplish what it set out to do? It does that and a lot more. I can't say that I remembered a single rhyme, but I did find myself shopping without a list and easily whipping up meals with what I had on hand. <br />To call this a cookbook is incorrect. Yes, it contains recipes but it's really much more than that. It's thought provoking. Eggs become a meal when turned into omelets and frittatas. Eggs for dinner? Why not? In the mood for something more than spaghetti but don't have a lot of time? \\"Quick Ravioli\\" and \\"Quick Lasagna\\" use wonton wrappers found in most grocery stores instead of pasta. Yes, it really works.<br />I found this a very useful book that I can see myself referring to often. The concepts are so easy that even a novice cook should feel comfortable. I plan on buying a few of these as presents. If you don't feel comfortable cooking without a recipe, this cookbook might change your mind.	2000-12-31

Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was hoping that it would cover  ingredients substitutions that weren't so obvious.<br />I would have given it  a 4 star rating even so but my biggest problem is that the layout is really  poor. Trying to find substitutions for red or white wine are either not in  their or not in an order that makes sense to me anyway.<br />It is handy but  not the end all, be all of books. Maybe the 4th edition will be better.	2000-03-09

Ingredients are  things you'll probably already have on hand, and the few you don't will  enhance your culinary closet!<br />It also explains the difference between  various rices, gives suggestions for which rice works best for which dish  and all directions are clear!<br />There is a mixed vegetable Venetion  (spelling?) stew that is not only delicious, but it reheats fabulously for  lunch the next day.<br />A must for anyone's collection.	1999-07-26

If you don't want to be completely paranoid about computers and science, you might want to skip this one.<br />Once again Dean Koontz has taken an everyday situation and shown that not everything is as innocent as it  seems. Our villian is probably someone you know (I think I used to work  with him!!!) and our &quot;heroes&quot; are people who seem the most  unlikely.<br />If you want to know what all the hoopla is over Dean Koontz,  this is the book to start with. Just keep any dangerous objects out of arms  reach and warn people not to sneak up on you while reading this one!	1999-01-25

It's a &quot;sweet&quot; story for Dean Koontz but that's not to say it's not worth reading if you are a fan of his horror books. Nothing to  make you lock doors and bolt windows but you wont be disappointed in it's  enjoyment factor.	1999-01-25

A lady at work handed me the book-on- tape and I only listened to it because I hadn't any new ones to listen too. To say that I was hooked was an understatement. The story simply works. Don't try to read to much into  it. Don't try to analyze it. Simply enjoy it.<br />I have to agree that the  title is misleading. There is no real interaction between our main living  and dead characters. It would probably have been better to make these two  separate stories. Regardless, the story works! I'm still not a romance fan  but this was a pleasant dip into that pool.	1999-01-25
US	52494925	R1Z4FNX2M0ECJT	1562612751	7349917	The 100 Best Small Art Towns in America: Where to Discover Creative Communities, Fresh Air, and Affordable Living	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Where Art Still Matters	Lists towns of relatively small size to down right tiny where art still  matters. Good for those looking for a place to settle down as well as those  who might want to visit. It doesn't cover every small art town and I'm not  sure exactly what criteria is used to pick the towns. The information none  the less is interesting and worth a read.	1998-09-02
US	52494925	R33VU8Z55M9LNH	0671652370	134454761	Lightning	Books	4	0	0	N	N	The Guardian	This is a book with memorable characters and a neat story line. What would you think if you found out you had a &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;? What would you do if you found out that this &quot;Angel&quot; is just a man,  though no ordinary man?     &quot;Lighting&quot; is a neat story that will keep you guessing, laughing   and listening. I found the end too predictable but it doesn't hurt  the story iteself in the least. A departure from typical Koontz   but definitly worth the money.	1996-11-07

This is probably going through Gerlad's wife's mind as she lays helplessly handcuffed  to their bed. A bed that happens to be in the middle of no where at   this moment.     We watch on in horror as her mental state is tested. Tested by   hunger and thirst, by fear (both real and imagined). Listening  to this story on a trip back from Florida left me spooked!     Moral of the story: Never, not ever, do you piss of the guy   hold the handcuff keys!	1996-11-07

The leaves were changing colors, and I was in the best of spritis. This book was exciting and not one to but down.  And just when you thought you figured it all out, a new direction  emerges.     I say mistake earlier because Holly Thorne's character is one I  could relate to and was wishing I had an Jim Ironheart of my own.  This is a thrilling story that is full of detail (great mental  imagery) and great writing. Dean Koontz has done it again!	1996-11-07
