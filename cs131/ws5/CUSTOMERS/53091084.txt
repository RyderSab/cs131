It made much of the military history I have read more \\"real,\\" by looking at it from the perspective of regular GIs.  From the technophilia of the Vietnam Army to the disasterous Zero Defects Policy, the famous aspects of warfighting are presented as every-day minutae.  Recommended.	2005-06-26

Following up a History of Greece, Robinson followed it up in a work as great as his first.<br />From Tarquin, the first King of Rome, to the coming of the Huns, Robinson describes the fortunes of a small city state in a League of 40 to the painful death of a world empire.  It's hard to describe how good this book is -- Robinson's very human writing style makes the ancient world very believable.<br />On a personal note, this book is much sadder and more tragic than the History of Greece.  That book ended with Alexander the I, and the Hellenistic Age.  This ends with the murder of freedom by Diocletian, and the impotance of the last Western Emperors, and the Dark Ages.	2002-08-02

I was disappointed by The Mark -- The Mark's meandering plot was a definite letdown compared to the suspense of Apollyon, Assassins, and Indwelling.  Desecration more than makes up for this.<BR>Before I read this, I considered Indwelling to be the highwater mark of Christian fiction.  Creating a meaningful religious novel spanning only three days was a monumentous achievement.  Desecration tops even that.

So I was understandibly sad when I got done with this one.<br />1. The main theme of this book is not &quot;How We Believe&quot; (a subject which is barely brouched), but &quot;Shermer is a great guy.&quot;  We hear about how his friends think he is too accomodating to religionists, etc.<br />2. For a skeptic, Shermer happily ignores the rules of logic and critical thinking. This begins right away, when he says the Shroud of Turin should not be considered 2,000 years old unless there is great proof of this.  Fine.  But then Shermer claims that it should be believed that it is 16th century until proven otherwise.  He can't have it both ways.<br />3. He advises the use of ad hominum attacks on religionists.  Ask them if they would be good without god, he advises.  If they answer yes, they have proven god irrelevent.  If they answer no, they show that have a bad character, and so the religionists lose no matter what the answer.<br />For a good apologetic of skepticism, &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot; by Carl Sagan is a much more interesting, more honest, and better written book.	2001-02-11

I read it in less than a day, and I am only sorry I don't have the second book in the series.<br />Be warned, though, that the book starts off bad.  Much of the first scene seems stolen from the Steven King novella, &quot;Langoliers.&quot;  Also, the way some characters are introducded just comes across as cheesy.<br />Once you get past the first few pages, though, you can't put it down.  Like Rand's &quot;Fountainhead&quot; this is a message book, and if you don't treat it that way your experience will probably suffer.  Happily though, like Fountainhead, you don't need to agree with the message (I didn't) to enjoy the book and be wrapped up in the experience.<br />Read the book, free your eyes and ears, and listen to the most popular apolgetic for Christianity since &quot;The Gospel of the Infancy.&quot;	2001-01-24

The book is exceedingly well written and hard to put down.  Though it ignores broad swaths of Soviet history (military confrontation with the west, relationship with China, etc), it admits that it doesn't tell all, and, more importantly, tells what it does very clearly.<br />The crisises of 1956, 1968, and 1980 are examined in detail, and throughout humor is used to get the point across (such at the Kiti-Kat fiasco, and contemporary Soviet and Eastern European jokes about the regime).	2001-01-09

The first article is &quot;touchy-feely libertarianism,&quot;  arguing that &quot;innate goodness&quot; can be relied upon to create a  good education system.  Another approach is historic, using the example of  New York to show how public ed. wormed it's way into America through deceit  and fraud, and how it is designed to promoted conformity.  Another great  article claims harm is done to children in school, and that public schools  waste the majority of each student's day.<br />I have recommended this book to  several friends.<br />In conclusion, EDUCATION IN A FREE SOCIETY is an  interesting attack on the American &quot;tax school&quot; system of  education that's worth your time and money.	2000-09-20

Two follow ups, The Messainic Legacy and The Temple and the  Lodge were ever dimmer imitations, but the spark was still there.  Real  history was told, and explained with a new paradigm.<br />Other books, like  The Tomb of God or Key to the Sacred Pattern try to mathematically prove  themselves.  Though the geometry is tiring, the improbably coincidences are  not.<br />Then there's books like Holy Grail Across the Atlantic, which twist  history, often unintentionally hillariously.<br />As proof that  &quot;Arcadian&quot; literature (the poetic form of which involves a  shepherd either romantically or sarcastically making improbable promises to  his love) is inspired by a Holy Family, they say that a certain character  in the story bought a painting by Pousson, and another by Teniers.  Since  the Pousson was was an Arcadian scene, by Teniers probably was one two.   The author neglects to mention that the same source the Tenier painting was  of SAINT ANTHONY THE HERMET, and that the purchaser also ordered one of the  crowning of Pope Celestine V.<br />A hidden message in an supposedly ancient  document beings with &quot;Shepherdess, No Temptation, that Pousson,  Teniers, hold the key...&quot; the author says.  The implications of the  message are obvious!  But the message actually says<br />SHEPHERDESS NO  TEMPTATION THAT POUSSON TENIERS HOLD THE KEY PEACE 681 BY THE CROSS AND  THIS HORSE OF GOD I COMPLETE THIS DAEMON GUARDIAN AT MIDDAY BLUE  APPLES<br />But the author ignores this.  (If you're interesteed in this part  of the mystery, by Holy Blood Holy Grail instead).<br />The author claims that  a certain document called the &quot;Zeno Narrative&quot; is historically  accepted, and that the document refers to the Orkney Islands as  &quot;Frisland.&quot;  This is untrue.  The map of Frisland accompanying  the document shows a large island with many cities.  The same  &quot;accepted&quot; narrative tails of how the supposed author sailed to  &quot;Icari,&quot; the small kingdom the natives say was founed by Daedulus  and named after his son.  (For more info on this &quot;accepted&quot;  theory, read &quot;Phantom Islands of the Atlantic&quot;).<br />Then there's  pages 350-351, which show case the author's sloppy style.   &quot;Roosevelt's government financed a massive, and unprecedented,  construction of interstate highways... Without the network of highways he  created, called useless and worse by political opponents at th time,  America could never have mobilized its industry and military to cope with  World War II.&quot;  The DWIGHT DAVID EISENHOWER INTERSTATE HIGHWAY AND  NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM was built by President Eisenhower, during his  administration, because he was so impressed by how the GERMAN interstate  (&quot;autobahn&quot;) allowed the GERMANS to mobilize.<br />&quot;The winning  edge [in the race to build the atom bomb] was not the brains... but the  vast quantity of electrical power available because of the &quot;make  work&quot; project of the TVA. It is no accident Oak Ride was in  Tennessee.&quot;  Oak Ridge built a nuclear reactor.  It was not involved  in the war effort.  The author's thinking of the Manhattan project, which  took place in the New Mexico desert.<br />This is an awful, unfun book.  The  author is often mean spirited.  If you like namecalling, get &quot;Tomb of  God.&quot;  At least that one forces you to learn all about pentagons.	2000-07-07

This  temple, according to the author, was built using the English units of mile  and rod.<br />I bought this book because I had enjoyed Lincoln's two  &quot;conspiracy&quot; books, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, and his  follow up to this one, The Key to the Sacred Pattern.  Frankly, this book  is his worst.  His first two (HBHG and ML) are much more sweaping.   &quot;Key&quot; contains a better run-down of the outdoor temple geography,  and includes more on his &quot;journey&quot; to his discovery.<br />If you're  enthralled by the Rennes myster (whatever it is!), and have already tried  and liked The Tomb of God, this book may be for you.<br />A warning to those  expecting a book about secret societies!

Painful	I bought this book when I needed to learn how to write a VB program that accesses an Access database, and I learned that.  This book teaches what it wants to competently, with many in-depth examples.<br />For example, when the author wanted to demonstrate how SQL statements work, he gave step-by-step  instructions on how to build a &quot;query tester&quot; program.   Marvelous!<br />However, this is also the only programming book I've read that  gave me a headache.  I don't mean that it was too complicated, obtuse, or  boring.

That word is overused but this book deserves it.  I'm not good at hollistic reviews, so I'll break it down.<br />This book is about the strength of the human spirit.  Isabel Archer (the protagonist) is a hero.  Though she has some flaws which  temporarily inconvenience her, she doesn't give up.<br />The writing's  delightful.  It is full of wit, and while reading it you may come up with  your in.  Portrait is the first book I've read with this kind of humor, and  I'm glad I learned it.<br />The writing can be jilted.  Very important plot  points are just jumped over.  Twice I found myself reading backwards,  wondering when I missed something.  This can be extremely  aggrevating.<br />Possibly because of its paeanage to individualism, Portrait  strongly mirrors Rand's to largest books, Atlas and Fountainhead.  Though  this was doubtless unintentional it was extremely interesting.  Isabel is  strongly similar to the lead of the latter, while Osmond's character  repeatedly had me mutting &quot;The Man Who Belonged On Earth.&quot;<br />I  think the reason that some other reviewers and I disagree on the tone (some  say it is disenhartening) stems from the unique ending.  For two days after  I read it, I was arguing with myself &quot;what happened?&quot;	2000-04-01

For those who've read The Holy Blood &amp; the Holy Grail it is fun to hear of his first trip to  Rennes, or his first meetingwith Plantard.<br />The second part is a  recounting of the &quot;purely objective&quot; parts of the mystery.  It's  all pentagons, but not as obsessive as THE TOMB OF GOD.<br />The third part is  admitedly speculative.  If you've read the &quot;Affirmations&quot; section  of The Dilbert Future, it's like that.  Saying that there is not  satisfactory proof for the thesis, but that it is worth investigating, he  describes the layout of Bornholm island, Brittany, and Norway.  There are  some weird coincidences, like the persistance of the name  &quot;Rennes&quot; (or something similar) in all these locations, but  nothing is proven.<br />The last ten pages, which are part of the third  section, argues that the English system is ancient and based on the  distance between the poles.  It's weird, possible, and not proven.<br />If  you've just heard about Rennes-la-Chateau this is not the book for you.  If  you've already read much of it, and want some less heavy information about  it, The Key to the Sacred Patternis the book for you.	2000-03-19

If you can accept the fact that  it was written so as to be easily converted into a movie, it becomes  great.<br />There are two problems with the book.  Firstly, the begining is  illogical.  Saying what it is would be saying to much, but it's  bizaare.<br />Secondly, the only &quot;good&quot; character gets at most two  pages.  All other characters, while occasionally likeable, are scum or  cheats or conspirators.<br />However, the it very well written, it has a  satisfying ending, and I advise buying this book.	2000-02-17

I got it for $5 through a newspaper-style catalog of surplus books.  It was worth that much.<br />THE  TOMB OF GOD is pseudohistory.  It distorts how things happened, pulls  connections out of almost nothing, and is at times anti-Catholic (at least  not as rabid as Lincoln's wider anti-Christian bigotry).  Also unlike  Lincoln's work (Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Messianic Legacy) it is not  as enjoyable.<br />The Tomb of God (or, as the authors claim it was once  pronounced, CARDOU) is stuck in geometry.

HBHG is a wonderful book, pseudo-history at it's best. ML assumes you know the  theories laid out in HBHG).  The first fourth of the book is just more  &quot;proof&quot; of the authors' claims about Jesus.  It adds the claim  that Timothy was Jesus's twin and that Saint Paul distorted Christianity,  but it's not all that interesting.<br />The second fourth is devoted to  vicious (and now dated) attacks against President Ronal Reagan and American  fundementalists.  The authors, instead of criticising Reagen on his record,  choose a barage of name calling.<br />The second half of the book is a  masterpiece.  It continues the Holy Blood, Holy Grail story by adding more  information.  Pierre Plantard figures prominently, and the Priere of Sion  is made more &quot;round.&quot;  If you loved Holy Blood, Holy Grail you  will almost love this book.  Once you get the first half out of the way it  is hard to put down.  Though nothing &quot;definitive&quot; is reached, the  conspiracy looks even better.

The purchase of this book was  certainly worth it, as it was very interesting.  <br />_Holy Blood, Holy  Grail,_ a play on the old french SANGRAAL, which can be broekn up to mean  either, is a conspiracy theory.  The conspiracy theory is huge,  encompassing the past several millenea and presenting a view more fluid  than the orthodox one has.<br />However, the author's fail to support several  of their claims.  At other times they contradict themselves, such as  &quot;The French Revolution was a disaster for the Order of Sion,&quot;  accompanied mere pages later by &quot;There is no Reason to Believe that  the Order of Sion is less powerful than it was in the past.&quot;  <br />Also  there are a couple red herrings, some of which take up considerable space  and go nowhere.  The Tribe of Benjamin for about a 100 pages seems  meaningful, but then it brushed off as &quot;irrelevent.&quot;<br />And then  they're the author's weird political attitudes.  In the Conclusion it calls  for a reinstatement of feudalism.  This strange view is extended into the  past, as where repeatedly the authors claim that the Roman Catholic  Church's &quot;abandonment&quot; of the Merovignians was inexcuable,  indefensivle, etc., though the authors themselves espouce the original  theory than the Merovignians had secretly converted back to Arianism some  time before.<br />According to the author's Constantine's conversion to  Christianity was merely politics.  Then they doubt it happended at all.   Then they claim that he maybe converted, but really was a Sun worshipper.   Then we're told he was converted against his will.<br />The authors twist the  Bible to suit their own ends.  It claims one Gospel said he was born rhich.   It claims that he, explicitly mentioned as a guest in the story of Water  into Wine, was the groom.<br />In summary, if you want an original, bizzare,  and all-encompassing conspiracy theory read this book.  If you want to  learn history, look elsewhere (_The Last Apocolypse_ is highly  recommended).  If you want to learn about the effects of Christianity, read  a book by Thomas Cahill.	1999-12-09

US	53091084	RXKGAAA3J3WY4	0385493800	934400771	The Testament	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Continuing the tradition of &quot;The Street Lawter&quot;	&quot;The Testament&quot; continues Grisham's morality push that began with &quot;The Street Lawyer.&quot;  It is only the main theme every once in a while, and at most for a long paragraph, but it detracts somewhat from  the story.<br />His writing is also worrisome at times, as Grisham is in the  habbit of using pronouns with out introducing the objects they are  describing.<br />However, &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; is a _very_ good book.   I averaged a hundred pages a day on it, and loved every minute of it.	1999-06-26

However, it was a very frustrating book.  Quality would oscillate widely, going from simply boring, to overly simplistic, to captivating.   Without giving away the ending, it has the same emotional tone as AFTER THE  FIRST DEATH or (to a lesser extent) GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA (by Douglas  Coupland).  Pass on this one.<br />Compared to AFTER THE FIRST DEATH, FADE was  a disappointment	1999-04-05

I'll keep this short:<br />THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a very, very good book (but awfully depressing).  Besides being interested for the story, it is one of the few books I'm looking forward to reading again to find a  &quot;deeper meaning.&quot;  Read this book.	1999-03-29
US	53091084	R3RCKNVTNPP77T	0887309100	349167458	The Dilbert Future: Thriving on Business Stupidity in the 21st Century	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	Wonderful book.  Light humor, then good stuff	THE DILBERT FUTURE is a good book of light humor (essentially the strip in novel form) for the majority of the book.  Though not as good as THE DILBERT PRINCIPLE, it is still enjoyable.  Then the book becomes  great.<br />After 200 some pages of stuff like &quot;Prediction Number  Whatever: In the future, we'll have whales&quot; the second-to-last chapter  starts out &quot;The Theory of Evolution will be Scientifically Disproven  in your lifetime.&quot;  After that the book becomes wonderful (and makes  up for the 3 star quality of the rest of it).  Very, very interesting.	1999-03-22

The book shines in the end (from the rule of the Triumveriate to the epilog), but until then it is plodding.  After getting one-third of the way  through, I put of finishing this book for 8 months and have no  regrets.<br />If you like this peroid, there are two better books to read.   The first is A HISTORY OF THE BALKAN PENNENSULA by Ferdinand Schevill,  which in its 533 pages gives a better understanding of everyone (Bulgars,  Vlachs, Byzantines, and Turks) in the area.  The other is THE EMERGENCE OF  MODERN TURKEY by Bernard Lewis.  The latter is memorable if nothing more  than its summary of Kemal Ataturk's &quot;This is a hat&quot; speech.	1999-02-08
US	53091084	R2L61U9YK19PR3	0785275290	53043610	The Illuminati	Books	5	1	5	N	N	Incredibly wonderful, and a fun read	When I started the read the book, it seemed very strange.  The plot was highly imporbably, the author messes up technical details too often, and the whole &quot;It's the Masons!&quot; conspiracy theory seemed a bit  old.<br />But still...<br />I loved it, and I finally figured out why.  It's  _happy_.  Pure evil is a contender, and you know it's going to lose!   Whether or not you agree with the author's Christianity, you'll find  yourself going &quot;Yeah!&quot;<br />If good, depressing works have gotten  you down (like _Of Mice and Men_ or _The Glass Menagerie_), have fun and  read this book.	1999-01-19
US	53091084	R1W3713YYYUJ4	0226869016	737172852	A Short History of the Future	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Enjoyable on many levels, it gets you thinking for months	ASHOTF is one of the best books I have ever read, and the most influential  (Structure of Scientific Revolutions and A History of the Balkans are the  others), it doesn't leave you.<br />Enjoyably at the end of every section,  there are personal notes from &quot;ancestors&quot; of the authors.  Also  included are some major political characters from obscurity to leadership,  as well as the define and fall of nations.  ASHOTF manages to perfectly  meld a family history, a history of nations, and a discussion on philosophy  while seeming to be neither.  It makes you see everybody, from your parents  to Jefferson, Marx, and Mao, in a new light.	1998-09-30
