I have always been interested in spiritual and emotional growth in adulthood and though various people like Erikson, Vaillant, Levinson, Peck, Gebser, Jung, and Maslow etc. have tackled this issue in many interesting ways, I liked Moody's account the best. He explains it in a way that I can relate to and has beautiful life stories of people that go with it. This book has helped me get a better grasp on where I have been, where I am, and where I am going and I am sure that this makes all the difference in the overall quality of my life. Another book that I like equally on this subject matter is one called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This tremendous book by Sato looks at this from a very different perspective but has extremely interesting stuff about consciousness and relationships as well as human growth. Yet it makes everything look so simple, yet so clear. Both these books deserve five stars if not more.	2004-07-12

This is a brilliant piece of work by one of the most advanced thinkers of our time. If you are interested and knowledgeable in the field of consciousness studies and you have not read this book, you absolutely must read it. If you are not knowledgeable in this area but are still interested, I strongly suggest you read, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It explains some of these ideas in language everyone can understand. It is also a brilliant book! Happy reading!	2004-07-06

This is one of the books that changed my life.  Like everyone, I first heard about Dr. Phil on TV and found that he had some interesting things to say.  So I decided to buy this book because I thought I might learn some valuable things.  By reading this book I learned so much about myself that I am now a completely different person.  I am more aware of my inner desires and feelings and I am more aware of my instinctive responses. It is a new life! Once I got to this level, I was ready for a little more and so I read another great book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.  That book took me to a totally new level!  It gave me the answers to almost all of the questions I had about what was going on in my life.  I hope that everyone can learn these valuable things to change their lives in a positive way!!!	2004-05-27

This is an excellent book for self-exploration and self-development. It provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the shadow in Jungian theory and introduces us to various practical exercises to explore our own shadow. Though I'm not really a Jungian, this was a very interesting book that gave me lots to think about. If you'd like a more simplistic but nevertheless absolutely excellent explanation of the psyche, try reading &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an amazing book that explains almost everything you wondered about in a concise and down to earth way!  Five stars may not be enough for this one.	2004-05-19

I never really understood this idea called enlightenment but was interested in it for many years. This motivated me to read many many books on this topic hoping that one of them would click someday before becoming convinced that it was just an unrealistic idea for flaky dreamers. It may have caught me at the right time but this book is really the one that clicked for me. Tony Parson's has the special ability to catch people's attention and direct it in the right way so that we can see who we really are first hand. I thought it was an amazing book and I hope many of you get that chance to read it too. I just read another absolutely stunning book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It discusses this idea of enlightenment in the context of theories about interpersonal relationships, human development, and evolution. They are both absolutely excellent books and I would recommend them to anyone interested in developing a better understanding of themselves and the world around them (which are in essence one and the same thing).	2004-05-18

This book helps us understand the difference between the ego and the true self.  It shows that the problems we have are caused by holding onto our selfish desires, and not caused by someone or something else.  And then it helps you go through the process of letting things go.  It is really a wonderful book that I cannot say enough about.  If you want to know how this relates to all sorts of other things that we do, I suggest the truly amazing book called, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.  Instead of going into this process of letting go in detail, it explains all of this in a larger context. These books really complement each other.  I hope you get as much joy out of these books as I did.	2004-05-15

A friend of mine advised me to read his book when I was down and out, lost all hope, and was beginning to feel that the world is just a bitter place full of people desperate to take advantage of each other. As you can tell from some of the reviews for this book, there are people like that (because they live in fear) but this book taught me that there is so much more! When we are afraid, we see the world as such a hostile place and are never able to open up and appreciate the beauty of life. We become aggressive, defensive, and disrespectful of many things. When we let go of that fear, we are able to embrace the beauty of everything and everyone despite the flaws they have. The authors of this book explain this very nicely but there is another book that explains this exquisitely! It is a book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato and it is an absolute must read as well! If you are ready to let go of fear, this book will be a life changer!	2004-05-05

I thought I was happy, I thought I was mature.  I was looking for another challenge in life, so I picked up this book to see if there was anything useful. Whoa! This book made me realize that I have a whole other side to myself that I was not aware of. It made me understand what really being whole as a person is all about. I cannot say enough about this book!  Thanks to this book, I feel I can really see the positive and negative sides of myself.  I am using it to figure out how to get rid of the clutter in my life and embrace the simple beauty of it all.  Another book that is really helping me now is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.  It is another one of these terrific books that looks at these things with a focus on our relationships with other people. Both of these books are highly, highly recommended!!!

I understand why some people rate this book very highly while others rate it very low. If you have been exploring the deeper meaning of life and your own psyche for a while already, this book seems too simplistic, pop-culturish, and beginner oriented and perhaps somewhat misleading. If you are beginning the search for deeper meaning, this book is interesting, exciting, inspirational, and spiritually enlightening. When I first read this book, I was very inspired. It may even have been the book that started my search. Now after about nine years, I have found that although a number of the messages in this book are somewhat misleading, it gives us enough food for thought to become motivated in the inquiry. A alternative superb and more advanced book with more psychology and less &quot;psychic&quot; types stuff that explains this material very very well is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is written in a way that is easily understandable to beginners but the content is just so amazing that even people who have been reading about this stuff for years will be enlightened by it! Wonderful stuff!	2004-03-09

Until a close friend pointed this out to me, I never realized how empty I felt about my life and how bitter I have become toward the world. I noticed that there was defensiveness in everything I did and was spitting out sarcastic, critical, and sometimes even very angry and hurtful remarks at people left, right, and center. Then I realized. Where did it all go? The moments when I truly felt how beautiful some things, music, and people are. The trust and care I had for other people. The utter appreciation of life that I felt when I was little. Where did it all go? \\"Healing the Child within\\" was a book that helped me figure this out. I looked back at my life, my history, and my childhood and realized that although I was never abused and never had any serious trauma, life keeps chipping away at us from a very early age. As this happens, our hearts begin to close little by little.  It even learns to attack in order to protect itself from potential danger. Even though I still have lots of psychological work to do, I have been learning to open my heart again. It is scary but I can assure you that it is worthwhile. I started with this book and I think it is a great place to start. It is highly recommended. I now have another fantastic book I really like regarding this topic. It is called the \\"Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It explains all of these things in a more simple way and places this process in the larger context of human development and evolution. It is absolutely awesome! I would highly recommend this one by Sato as well.	2004-02-06

I have read many books on relationships and I have been disappointed many times. This book, however, is not one of those. It helps us put not only our relationships but also our lives in perspective and provides us with extremely useful advice about life and relationships. I think I can honestly say that I am a more mature person after working with this book. If you are interested in this topic, you will also like &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato because it is a very fascinating theoretical book on human development and relationships! It provides us with a map of where we are and where we are going in our development and our evolution as living beings. Both of these books are just excellent!	2004-02-05

I can really say that I am a happier person because I read this book. The other completely excellent book that has helped put this in even better perspective is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. That one is also a fantastic book!

I recently survived a serious illness and I feel that owe a lot of this to Caroline Myss and this book that she wrote. As she says in this book, our body is a reflection of our state of mind in many ways. Because of this book, I have been focusing on bringing myself to a healthy state of mind which leads to a healthy body. In doing so, I am learning so much about my own personal, emotional, and spiritual development partially through this book but also from other incredible books like &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato (this one is also a wonderfully inspirational, enlightening, absolutely great book by the way!). I love how Myss puts together some of parallels in the spiritual traditions of Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity and tries to show us that these teachings are all trying to guide us in a similar, if not the same, direction. Wonderful, Wonderful book!  Highly recommended!	2004-02-03

Although I expected this book to be like &quot;The Power of Now&quot;, it takes a different approach. I do like &quot;The Power of Now&quot; better but Eckhart Tolle uses some very interesting &quot;first &amp; second person&quot; ways to communicate some important messages to the reader in this book. It is refreshing in that way. I recently felt a little saturated with books regarding mindful living and the present moment and have began to search beyond that (though I may have lost the present moment by doing so). To my surprise, I found an excellent book called &quot;The Ever-Transceinding Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is a tremendously enlightening book for those of us who are not completely in the present moment all of the time but are on our way to learning how to get to a stage of life where we are able to stay close to this state for extended periods of time. I would recommend it to everyone seeking further development in this area of life. Good luck in your quest!	2004-01-30

I was having a world of problems in my marriage and I did not know where to look. After being inspired by some of the things Dr. Phil says on TV, I decided to read this book. Boy am I glad I did! Dr. Phil has this ability to take it right to you and this is what I needed at the time. His words punched right through my walls of denial and forced me to make a real objective re-evaluation of myself and my relationship. It did wonders for me. After having this rejuvenating experience, I decided to explore and learn more about relationships and personal development. I have now found a more advanced book on relationships and personal development that is absolutely excellent! It is called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is more theoretical but an excellent read if you are one of those people who &quot;gets it!&quot; It has taken me one step closer to inner peace and happiness.	2004-01-29

I was recommended this book by a great friend who is always an inspiration to me. Though I expected it to be a good book, this book turned out to be an even bigger inspiration for me than I had expected. Although insecurity is what drives us all, it is the same insecurity that keeps us away from the truth. An even better book I read recently on this topic was, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is so excellent in explaining how we become insecure and how a large part of life is a process to figure a way out of it.

Many times in my life, I was placed in social situations that left me feeling so depleted afterwards and I could not exactly grasp why this was happening. When I read this book, I started to understand how many people play these games that end up making me feel used and hopeless. After a year or so, I also began realizing that I play some of these games myself. I realized that although they work as temporary coping devices, they become obstacles to my personal development in the long run. This is when I really decided to change my life. I began living with a new awareness of the behaviors of not only others but my own as well! It has worked wonders and if I could explain this process, I would like to share it with everyone! But since I am not so good at explaining these things, I will suggest a book that explains this very well. It is called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato and it explains all of these things in such a great way! Read this book by Berne! Read the book by Sato!

Ken Wilber, the master of integration, attempts to integrate many theories in the diverse field of psychology, philosophy, and spirituality in this book. It is full of very interesting ideas and insights. Even if you do not agree with some of his ideas, it is very interesting and worth contemplating. In this book, Wilber convincingly writes that the four quadrants (his theory of the \\"1,2,3 of consciousness\\") are highly related to each other, and that they need to be integrated in order to advance our understanding of things. However, he really does not go into much detail about how we can go about doing this. I found that the book called the \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato goes one step further and actually attempts an integration of these four quadrants. This fantastic book by Sato is a little more readable and takes this idea to an even more advanced level. Both books should be on your must read list if you are interested in the intersection between psychology, philosophy, and spirituality.	2004-01-12

There are many books on self-help, relationships, spirituality, and psychology for the general public out there but this one is probably the best I have ever read by far (and believe me, I have read many). This book explains almost everything I wanted to know in a simple, interesting and inspiring way! It provides us with answers about our relationships, our development, our mind, as well as the evolution and history of the world. I couldn't believe how everything made so much sense when I was reading this book! It is quite simple but I never really got it and from what I have heard from other people and read in other books, not many people do get it. Don't get me wrong, the answers do not always provide easy solutions to our everyday problems (it's not a book that promises you instant happiness) but it helps us put our problems in perspective and deal with them effectively. It enables us to see how it all comes together if we understand some basic underlying rules about nature. Don't miss out. Highly, Highly, Highly recommended!	2003-09-15

I believe that he makes his point most clearly in this book as well as \\"Sex, Ecology, and Spirituality\\".  Although \\"Sex Ecology and Sprituality\\" is a scholarly masterpiece, this book is the easier to understand for the lay reader.  If you are new to Wilber's \\"Comprehensive Everything\\" type books, I would suggest reading this book before reading his other ones. I  think although many of us Wilber lovers struggle to fully understand and appreciate his vision, his books are a true joy to read.  If you are interested in these topics, another book that is easy and enjoyable to read is \\"Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence\\" by Toru Sato.  It is also a wonderful book on the subject-object differentiation (dual vs nondual)!  Both books help remind us that although our world of objects is useful, the world of subjects is what makes it beautiful!  Happy reading!	2003-02-14

Since then, I am proud to say that I feel happier and more mature as a person and am currently in a wonderful relationship. Don't get me wrong, this book is not a quick fix. We don't change overnight, but it puts our selves and our relationships in perspective and helps us get on the right track to recover. I am now using another fascinating book called &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato that is helping me develop further.  It is also a wonderfully helpful book!
