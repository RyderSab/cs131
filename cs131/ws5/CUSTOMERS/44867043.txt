It's good to see someone who's been paroled be productive.Don't waste your time on what is basically a pamplet by a guy trying to sell books by offering &quot;jailhouse knifefighting&quot; techniques.Even his grip is all wrong-if you stabbed someone with his preferred grip there's a good chance of losing some of your own fingers.Let's face it:if he really knew from experience what works in jail he'd still be inside.There is no technique to the knife/dirk/edge in jail;all that is required is the will to attack.Anyone should know that about 95% of knife fighting in jail is basically coming up and sticking someone in the back(repeatedly if possible).Pentecost even has the nerve to &quot;debunk&quot; other types of knife fighting.If it comes down to knife fighting either run,pick up something as the equalizer,or carry a gun.If you want a better book on knife fighting get &quot;Sevillian Steel&quot; by James Loriega.	2003-01-04
