Although I was an experienced user, I found that this guide filled in the gaps of my knowledge for both the capacities of the iPod and iTunes.   <br /> <br />The initial bit about buying and using both may be of some help to newbies, but I combed through the rest of the book and found wonderful tips on tweaking the sound of files, obtaining music online not just from the iTunes store, but at other Mac friendly sites, using the iPod as a hard drive and organizer as well as the extras, and help & maintenance chapters.   <br /> <br />The only problem I had with this book is that a few of the websites cited were dead links and no longer available.  Hopefully, the authors will correct that in their upcoming second volume that will be released in October 2005.  Other than that, the book is a neat and compact reference that is comprehensive and readable.  I would recommend it to newbies and iPod and iTunes aficionados alike.	2005-07-21
US	51972396	R1ROE9KHPHUQGN	0345475674	451458080	Pompeii: A Novel	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Quick Travel Read	If you're looking for a quick read while traveling, then this would be a good selection.  I took a third year Greek and Roman Studies course on the archaeology of Pompeii and Herculaneum and can say that Harris did his research.  He uses all the famous names, buildings and graffiti that archaeologists have recovered even down to the lonely gladiator that was found amongst other bodies in the building next to the amphitheatre.  Harris even provides accurate detail of Herculaneum which was also buried by Vesuvius half of which has been recovered by archaeologists while the other half remains buried underneath the new town.      I appreciated the amount of detail and research that went into this book, but I did not care for the story or the characters themselves.  The story surrounding the characters was as predictable as Vesuvius blowing its top and the characters were one dimensional.  Harris even goes so far as to rip-off the banquet scene in Petronius' Satyricon where he satirizes Trimalchio's feast which, as another reviewer pointed out, is lazy writing.  However, if you do have even the slightest interest in this area and time period, in archaeology or volcanology give it a read, because the work is in the details.	2005-04-13

The Secret was the first Garwood novel I read upon the recommendation of a friend.  I really enjoyed that book and I was thrilled to learn that it had a sequel.  That discovery happened five years ago and I keep coming back to these books and have to read them at least once a year, especially Ransom. <br /> <br />Ransom concentrates on Brodick Buchanan and Ramsey Sinclair eight years after The Secret ends.  Enter Lady Gillian who's on a quest to find her sister and the treasure box in order to ransom her Uncle Morgan from the evil Baron Alford.  By rescuing a Highland boy, she's able to enlist the help of Brodick and his friend Ramsey.  While trying to help Lady Gillian, Ramsey discovers he has problems of his own one of which is Bridgid KirkConnell.  As luck would have it there is an happily ever after. <br /> <br />Let's face it, the characters are stereotypical and the plot predictable; however, for me it's the interaction and dialogue between the characters that keep me entertained.  The witty banter is refreshing and Garwood even provides laugh-out-loud moments of pure mirth that will have others curious about what your reading.	2005-04-12

Having no previous experience with Greek plays, I found that these two plays have universal themes that still resonate down to our time.<br />The Bacchae was written around 406 B.C. when Euripides was approximately seventy years old.  The play is a dramatization of Dionysus' return to his birthplace Thebes where he exacts revenge, because he is not given proper recognition as a divinity.  The main themes include the superiority of the gods and the importance of appeasement and justice.  Pentheus, the protagonist, represents human failing to respect the gods so that he, along with the rest of society, is guilty of hubris.  The story also illustrates that a complete state of ecstasy can be sanctioned through Dionysiac worship as long as it is controlled by the god.  There is also a patriarchal element that outlines the gender hierarchy within the divine and mortal societies of the Greeks.<br />The Women of Troy highlights the trials and tribulations of three women who were most affected by the Trojan War.  Andromache, Cassandra, and Helen all have stories of heartbreak to tell and Euripides tells their stories in a sympathetic fashion.  This play was produced in 415 BC, and it was a part of a trilogy, but the other two plays have been lost.  Historically, the play was performed after the massacre on the island of Melos when the Athenians severely punished the inhabitants who wanted to withdraw from the League.  Scholars have seen the play as a condemnation of the massacre set outside the walls of Troy.<br />I enjoyed reading these plays, and when I have some free time I'd like to continue on and read Ion and Helen which are plays also found in this edition.	2004-07-16

Powell was used in my Greek and Roman mythology class as a companion book to the original sources studied.  Those included Hesiod's Works and Days, and Theogony, Euripides' The Bacchae, and The Women of Troy as well as excerpts from Homer's Iliad and Odyssey taken from Stanley Lombardo's Essential Homer.  This was a readable and concise introduction that deals with the definitions and interpretation of myth, the background of myth, and the themes of myth.  Along with an extensive index, the author provides further readings, maps and a table of the Greek and Roman Pantheon.

Its origins are based in oral tradition and the poem itself is structured in run-composition with framed episodes that use repetitious formulas.  Due to its structure, the narrative can shift suddenly from one topic to another, thus leading to inconsistencies in the gods' parentage.  The Theogony is a succession myth that explains how generations of patriarchal gods overthrow each other until one god consolidates power.  Therefore, the story has a linear progression, but it also has a cyclical element since each generation represents a reincarnation of previous generations that all try to keep their children secluded from power.  Four main themes in the Theogony include:  the concern for the displacement of elders, the frustration of gender politics, the folktale element of moral messages, and the concern of sexual excess demonstrated by the gods.    Hesiod also wrote Works and Days which was a poem to his brother who had squandered his share of their father's inheritance.  Throughout the poem, Hesiod outlines practical guidelines for basic living.  He also gives examples of Greek cosmogony such as the Ages of Man that is not found elsewhere in Greek literary sources.  Scholars have described Hesiod's worldview as apocalyptic and pessimistic, but Hesiod's stern dealings with his brother occasionally give way to a more lighthearted tone which Lombardo emphasizes in modern prose.    Both translations are enlightening reads and Lombardo gives extensive, useful notes, and Robert Lamberton provides an excellent introduction that outlines Hesiod's life and his poems.	2004-07-16

This technique reminded me of the movie called &quot;Momento.&quot;  However, this technique did not work with the book, because after the climax I felt like I had to slog through the rest of the material to get to the abrupt ending.  I liked the author's use of imagery in her prose, because I could imagine myself being in the Dominican with the family.  I also liked the well developed characters, although I do not have a particular favourite.  Some of the stories are quite cute and others are more serious.  This is a very interesting author, because she's willing to experiment and take chances and for that I applaud her courage and I am eager to see her develop into great author.	2001-12-21

In my review of 'Three to Get Deadly' I said that things were repeating themselves within the series and that Evanovich needed to do something new to spice things up.  After reading 'Hot Six' I still see overlapping material, but this book is just too laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly hot to put down!<br />In the sixth instalment of the Stephanie Plum series, Plum has been assigned to track down her mentor, Ranger.  She knows her skills could never bring him in and even if she did by luck, Plum doubts that she could turn him over to the authorities.  In the meantime, Grandma Mazur has moved in with Stephanie which puts a dent in her lovelife with Joe Morelli.  And there's new characters, including a dog nobody wants to keep and a stoner Mooner and his trekie friend Dougie who have some excellent prat-fall scenes.  Thank you Evanovich for livening up the series!  I can't wait for the seventh instalment to be published in paperback!	2001-07-20

However, this is no ordinary old man.  This is Uncle Mo who is a respected elder in the Trenton community and people are willing to bet their lives on his innocence.  As the body count rises, Plum lands right in the middle of drug dealers and low-life fugitives who want her out of the picture.  As always, with the help of her friends Ranger, Lula, and Morelli and her family, Stephanie has to make sure that this case will not kill her.<br />Again, Evanovich gives a lot of laughs, but on the whole I can see weaknesses starting to appear in this series.  By now, Stephanie should be getting the hang of the bounty hunter business and getting some skills rather than relying all on luck and Ranger as her back-up.  The cat and mouse game Stephanie's been playing with Morelli is getting stale.  Grandma Mazur is becoming annoying and how much bad luck can one person have with cars?  I like the series and will read 4, 6, and 7 to finish it, but it feels like same old, same old and I hope that Evanovich puts more creativity in spicing up the plots than relying on her old bag of tricks.	2001-07-17

It's up to Leaphorn and Chee to find out who's causing all this destruction before they find another body.<br />As an anthropology student, I liked Hillerman's detailed research and his obvious respect of the Navajo Nation.  As a mystery reader, I liked the police story line and how it fit quite nicely with Hillerman's anthropological angle.  Great read and I hope to read more from this exceptional author.	2001-07-13

She accepts a job from her cousin Vinnie as a skip-tracer.  Problem is she hasn't got a clue!  That's the best part of the book, watching her stumble and pick herself back up to get an FTA.  Her first assignment is  to aprehend Joe Morelli, a former vice cop that's been charged with murder.  With Ranger's help and Stephanie's stubborness she might have a chance in catching him.  Great supporting cast including Grandma Mazur.  Very funny book that I read in one evening and plan to keep to read again.  Don't miss out!  This author's a winner!	2001-07-13

Along for the ride is a great supporting cast of characters including Ranger, Joe Morelli and Grandma Mazur.

Dann is accused of killing a child in a drunk-driving accident and is running away from the prospect of a long prison term.  Once she tracks him down, she needs to use every part of her tough-girl facade to get him back and before she starts to believe he's innocent.  I liked Flannigan, because she reminded me of Stephanie Plum and Kinsey Milhone.  I liked the way the story unfolded, although I found it predictable.

It was a fast read that kept me giggling from page to page as Stephanie Plum went through her life encountering off-beat characters.<br />Stephanie is a bounty hunter who is hired by her family to find her Uncle Fred who went missing after he had a dispute with the local garbage service.  Along the trail of her uncle, she has to deal with dead-beat FTA's like Randy Briggs, commitment-phobes such as Morelli, psychotics like Ramirez and a potential hot affair with Ranger.

This book is every bit a thrill ride that 'Cat &amp; Mouse' was and I couldn't predict the ending.  There were too many twists in the plot to keep up with, which is a good thing, because it keeps you on the seat of your pants.<br />In this novel, there are two competing serial killers one on the west coast and one on the east coast and it is up to Alex Cross to find both of them before they each take their next victim.  Alex is helped by a victim who escaped from Casanova to find the Gentleman Caller.  As they come close to catching both, the suspense builds to a fervent climax and an unbelieveable ending.

Being from the wrong side of the tracks, Sophie and her sister create a lot of gossip and rumours among the townfolk of Temptation, which leads them directly into the paths of Phin Tucker, mayor, and Wes, police chief and a whole lot of fun!<br />Another great story with interesting characters from Cruisie.

Unlike &quot;The Lord of The Flies&quot;, in  which the characters are waiting to be rescued, &quot;The Beach&quot;, is  where minimal contact with the rest of 'the world' is obstained from and  frowned upon as an invasion of their own private Eden.   That's why when an  Englishman, and his two French traveling companions, who are given a map to  this tropical utopia by &quot;Daffy&quot;, are very unwelcome when they  reach their destination.  As they are assimilated into the commune, they  are assigned jobs to help out the rest of the population.  However,  discontent arises among the masses, and a rift between two opposing  factions is revealed.  This break in unity is the group's tragic downfall  into oppression and murder.<br />The book's simple language, and it's short  paragraph structure made for a very fast paced novel, although the  protagonist's hallucinations were very annoying, and not engaging.  Also,  as in reading &quot;The Lord of The Flies&quot;, the ending left my stomach  queasy, and my thoughts disturbed.  Although I will read more from this  exceptionally talented author, the calibre of this novel was not up to par  with the great classic.	2000-08-15

I didn't like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (see review), but  the summary of &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; greatly intrigued me, so I bought  it.  I could not set this book down.  From beginning to end, I was filled  with wonder, awe, and fascination as to why a person would risk his life at  a chance to be &quot;on top of the world&quot;, and this book deftly gives  his reasons.<br />The expedition of eleven people led by Hall set out towards  the summit from Camp four on May 10, 1996.  Half never returned.  Little  did they realize that a thunderstorm was headed their way trapping them in  the 25,000 feet+ 'Danger Zone'.  Luckily a quick few, including the author,  were able to escape, and get back to Camp four safely, and awaited news of  their ill-fated teammates.<br />The reader knows what's going to happen in the  end because the word &quot;Disaster&quot;, is in the title of the book,  however, that didn't diminish the fact that this is a remarkable novel of  one man's story of survival, and possible redemption for having left his  teammates to die on the summit of Everest.  Highly recommended.	2000-08-10

I am very glad I did  because not only is this book going to be a great movie, if it's adapted  properly, it is also a great book in itself.<br />Starting before WWII, it  takes place on the island of Cephallonia which is in the Ionian Sea off the  coast of Greece.  There we meet an eclectic group of villagers, and among  them are Dr. Iannis, and his beautiful daughter Pelagia, Father Arsenios  the priest, and Velisarios, a muscle man who can carry out great feats of  strength.  Shortly after the declaration of war the Italians invade, and  occupy Greece and its islands, and here we're introduced to Captain  Corelli, soldier by day, and musician by night.  He falls for the already  betrothed Pelagia, and she unwittingly falls in love with her captor.   Although they are separated, their romance will see them through the  invasion of the Germans, and the brutality of the Greek communists.<br />I  enjoyed both the love story and the anti-war story that were intertwined  within this novel.  The author's gift for humour shines through the first  few pages when he sets up his story, and this helps the reader get through  the graphic, and saddening middle of the story, in order for the reader to  enjoy the poignant ending.  Very good book, and I can't wait to enjoy the  movie!	2000-08-07

Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying  well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.<br />That is until  Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and  accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Bingley becomes  captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth's eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has  an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and  can she see past his pride in order for them to get together?  That's the  question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.<br />I try  and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I've been doing  that for a few years, and yet, it's always fresh when a get around to  reading it.	2000-07-25

I've read 'When the Wind Blows', by Patterson, but this is the first Alex Cross novel I've read, and it won't be my last.<br />Alex Cross is an African-American  doctor/detective who uses his knowledge in psychology to get into the minds  of serial killers, and track them down before their next kill.  In this  novel, the odds are stacked against him when he has to deal with two serial  killers, one being Gary Soneji, who readers have met before in 'Along Came  a Spider', and a second serial killer whom the press call Mr. Smith.   However, the novel does a good balance between Cross's work and family  life, especially when things get interesting  with his children's school  principal Christine Johnson.<br />I liked the book for many reasons.  I liked  the short chapters, that helped propel the book along very quickly.  I  liked how the author lets the readers get inside the heads of the serial  killers, and find out how they tick.  I liked the balance between work and  family life because it gave the reader a reprieve from the gruesome aspects  of Cross's work.  Most of all, I liked the book because it had a complete  package, including a great story, and a wonderful cast of characters that  kept this book moving very fast.	2000-07-22

Reading this book you get the feeling you're actually withAthos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan as they fight for the honor ofthe king against the wicked Cardinal Richelieu and his accomplice Milady.  And what a fine fight it is!  All the action and adventure a person can get is right here in this book, and here's the good part: it's a classic!  It's because of these remarkable traits that it is a classic and it'll go down in history along with other classics such as 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', as great adventures for all ages to enjoy!	2000-07-17

I've never been able to forget it.  It's the haunting account of Winston Smith, an employee of the Ministry of Truth who hasn't forgotten the past, and who wants to  change the future.<br />However, Big Brother is watching him.  Try as he  might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces  extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the  government.<br />Published in 1949 during the Cold War, Orwell puts a spin on  communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold.  I  shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Oceania, even in the  slighest bit.<br />Highly recommended book for the whole world to read.  Let's  hope we never come to this.	2000-07-17

Not until after reading this book did I find out  that she used to be a romance novelist.  This particular book had more sex  and romance than crime and suspense.  However, I'm looking forward to  reading 'Ashes to Ashes', because Hoag does spin a web full of intrigue,  and she did it well enough to warrant another read.	2000-07-15

They both start out very similar, but end in two totally different ways.  I like the movie's ending  much better than I did the book's.<br />Both begin with Luther Whitney,  burglar extraordinaire, witnessing a brutal murder.  Now it's up to Whitney  to save his own hide, and expose the bad guys at the same time.  Question  is will he expose them, and therefore turn himself in as well, or will he  let them go, and get out of the country as fast as he can?<br />I liked the  book because it dealt with corruption and cover-ups at top levels, and how  low people will go in order to hide the truth.  I liked it so much that I  went out and bought Baldacci's next book 'Total Control'.	2000-07-11

The story was interesting enough, but the dialogue was bogged down, and it made the story drag.  I was only interested in what Billy Straight's take on the story was, and  unfortunately, there wasn't as much of him as I would've liked, especially  with a book that has his name for the title.  I did like Detective Petra  Connor as one of the main characters, she kept things interesting.  The  story did have its twists and turns, however, I found those predictable.   Not the edge-of-your-seat read I was looking for.	2000-07-02

Savannah falls for all the wrong guys, but knows when to  leave.  Robin falls for all the wrong guys too, she just doesn't care,  because she has this need for a man in her life.  Bernadine is struggling  with the news that her husband is leaving her for a young, attractive,  white girl, and Gloria is still afraid of the dating game, having never  been really in it in the first place.  However, they still manage to keep  their senses of humour intact, and keep the reader laughing along with them  to the end.  Can't wait to see the movie.	2000-07-02

I'm a staunch believer that books are always better than their movie counterparts.  For this particular book, I hope this is not the case.<br />I was looking for an  human interest story, what I got was a mariner's manual.  Of the  approximate 290 pages of the book, perhaps 150 of the pages actually had  something to do with the Andrea Gail and her seamen.  The other 140 pages  were dedicated to explaining different aspects of swordfishing,  tunafishing, history of Gloucester, history of the New England fishing  industry, and nuclear testing, above all things.<br />I do respect the amount  of research Mr. Junger has put into his book, but one must wonder if he  just lumped together a bunch of magazine articles and tried to bind them  together, rather than telling a real story, with some sort of character  development.  It felt like I was reading a documentary.  Let's hope the  movie based on the book doesn't become a documentary as well.	2000-06-26

However,  I liked her second novel better because there wasn't a  kid, like Em, stuck in the middle of a marital dispute.<br />I'm glad that  Maddie got out of her relationship with that creep of a husband Brent.  I'm  also happy that she ended up with C.L. Sturgis, and that Em liked him too.   The book made me laugh a lot and I could relate to the small town nucleus  where everybody knows everybody else's business.  I even liked the story  book ending, but I really believe that Crusie did an even better job with  'Crazy for You', which I gave 5 stars.	2000-06-22

The story just  keeps getting better after that once Judith and Iain find out they are in  love with one another.  My favourite part was the wedding ceremony.  It was  hysterically funny.

I had a blast reading it from cover to cover, laughing out loud more than a couple of times because of the author's great insights  into her characters.<br />Quinn, a school teacher, has a very normal  lifestyle, and that's what she hates about it, it's too normal.  Life with  her boyfriend Bill is going down the tube, especially when he refuses to  let Quinn keep Katie, a mongrel that one of her students found.  Quinn  moves out with the help of her old friend Nick Ziegler, and that's when the  sparks start to fly!<br />A well rounded book with great supporting characters  that add real texture to this remarkable book.	2000-06-22

I was very pleased after finishing the book to realize that the movie did not deviate too far from the book at all.<br />This is the first Stephen King  novel I've ever read.  I don't care for horror and supernatural stories,  but this particular story I felt needed to be read, not for the  supernatural tale, but for the human experience.<br />In the 6 sections of the  serial novel that comprises the paperback, King develops the story of John  Coffey, who is sent to death row, which is also called &quot;The Green  Mile&quot;, for the rape and murders of twin girls.  However, Paul  Edgecombe, security guard, doesn't believe that this man, who's afraid of  the dark, could have committed such a terrible crime. Intertwined within  this story are subplots that include, Percy Wetmore, Eduard Delacroix, and  William 'Billy The Kid' Wharton, and of course Mr. Jingles.<br />The movie is  approximately 3 hours long, and it was worth every minute.  I read the book  in 2 days, and that's a record for me, and it was also worth every minute.	2000-06-21

The book does this through the eyes of its protagonist Jane who  looks at herself and her family and friends to try to find the true meaning  of love and happiness in the 90's.<br />I like how the author uses Jane in all  but one of her short stories.  I even liked the short story that didn't  pertain to Jane or her surroundings.  It reminded me of a commercial that  comes on after watching 15 minutes of a sitcom; it was just a change of  pace.  I'm anticipating a wonderful writing career for this brilliant new  author.	2000-06-13

These particular Grisham books all have one thing in common:  courtroom drama.<br />There's nothing I like better  than a David and Goliath story and that's just what Grisham delivers in  'The Rainmaker', in which he pits Rudy Baylor, a lawyer fresh out of law  school, against Great Benefit Insurance and its lawyer Leo Drummond in a  bad-faith claim lawsuit.  What really made this book is the Black vs. Great  Benefit case, and how an insurance company would bend over backwards to not  get caught in its own lies.<br />Prior to the court case, the book goes into  some detail about the life of Rudy Baylor, law student, and his struggles  to get himself through school and into the labour market.  However, this  insight isn't really necessary and the book could've easily lost 50 pages  without the reader noticing a difference.<br />The movie 'The Rainmaker', with  Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor and Danny DeVito as Deck and John Voight as Leo  Drummond, does an excellent condensed version of the book.  It's time well  spent on either reading the book or watching the movie.	2000-06-07

Actually, he's never been able to surpass his first novel 'A Time to Kill', for characters and plot.<br />The main character,  Darby Shaw, is a law student who stumbles upon the conspirators of the  assassinations of two Supreme Court Justices.  Once this information is  leaked she becomes their next target.  Of course, she's smart enough not to  get killed, but rather is able to escape the bad guys, and find a newspaper  reporter who will run the story and blow the conspirators out of the  water.<br />Trouble is the reader doesn't know why Darby's running until two  thirds into the book when Grisham finally reveals the contents of the  brief. It's evident that this work of fiction was really meant to be a  movie script and not a novel. A quick beach read for any Grisham  enthusiast.	2000-05-31

Why is it that mystery writers, in general, use the same plot twist for an ending? I liked Kinsey, but I didn't like  the rest of the one-dimensional characters.  I also didn't like all the  descriptiveness in the book.  The reader doesn't need to know every little  detail and I get the feeling the author is being descriptive in order to  fill in the holes of a very thin plot.  I don't want to give too much away  in case some one else might care to read it.	2000-01-12

I heard that he was a good author, but I didn't like the psychopathic serial killer themes of his previous novels.   When I read the back of this book it sounded quite interesting.  Then I  read it.  The only promising thing about this book was Mr. Patterson's  biological research. Very quick read, but it looks like the author should  stick with serial killers.  It's what he does best.	1999-09-10

Unfortunately, it felt like I was reading a Harlequin Romance and not something I would call good fiction.  However, I liked the  two main characters, Victoria and Caitlin, although I couldn't always  understand where their emotions were coming from, especially at the end.  I  also think that the other characters' viewpoints were not needed and did  not add anything to the book that the reader could not already know and  appreciate.  I hope that Blume sticks to children's fiction in the future,  because that's what she's best at.	1999-06-21

It contradicts the old view of Prince Albert as an uncaring and unconcerned parent.  This book also provides a chapter per  child to enlighten the reader on how the children grew up within the royal  household and how each individually dealt with the death of their beloved  father.  The only problem with this book is that it is too short and  doesn't provide much information about the children after they had left the  brood and were married.  A factual book based on the royal family's letters  makes a good read for anyone interested in the royal family and the  Victorian Era.	1999-06-08
