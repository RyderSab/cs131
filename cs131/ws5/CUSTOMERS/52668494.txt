I'm in the minority here -- I hated this book.  I never really warmed up to Annie and Max, perhaps because I hadn't read earlier books in the series (although I loved mother-in-law Laurel).  But I just couldn't take all of the allusions to other mysteries -- sometimes several times in one paragraph.  I only finished the book because I had it with me on a long airplane trip, and even at that I set it aside for a discarded Harlequin romance right in the middle of the mystery.	2004-02-23

Unfortunately, the plot doesn't keep up with the atmosphere.  Clues point in every direction, but even on a second reading there's no &quot;aha!&quot; moment when the reader can see -- &quot;Oh, that's where the murderer tipped his/her hand!&quot;  The plotting is not getting better as this series progresses.	2004-01-15

It's an entertaining evening, nothing more.	2004-01-15

Forget about a coherent plot!  The book just ends, the killer is unmasked by accident, and Theodosia as usual flounders from suspect to suspect without ever coming to any conclusion.  Delaine Dish's sister is an annoying subplot, even if she does wind up doing the wrong thing at the right time to point Theodosia to the real culprit.  Perry Mason, where are you?

It passes all understanding that the author believes that anyone other than his nearest and dearest care about his traumas in taking French lessons or being snubbed by his fellow scholars in Paris (or being stung by a yellow jacket in the good old U.S. of A., for that matter).  A total waste of a long afternoon.  Watson and the reading public would have been better served had he just bought a set of Pimsleur CDs and then shut up.	2003-12-27

After a satisfying number of red herrings, the true killer came out of left field -- a violation of my cardinal principle in evaluating mysteries:  if I can't read the book a second time and find all the clues that pointed to the real killer, the author wasn't playing fair.  On this ground, Childs is guilty of mystery writer's crime no. 1: inadequate clues pointing to the villain.  The poison was never identified for the reader, so there was no ability to connect it to the perpetrator.<br />I found the descriptions of Charleston and the intricacies of a Tea Shop fascinating, but I agree that Theodosia Browning, the lead character, seemed more like a woman in her 50s (or from the 50s!) than a current thirtysomething.  The supporting characters were well drawn -- I enjoyed them all.  Here's hoping for better plotting as the series proceeds.	2003-12-27

This is the first in the Pennsylvania-Dutch murder series, and one can only hope that the series improves with practice.  By the time I was one-third of the way through, I'd slogged through enough whining about how the main character had been deprived of all the normal adolescent fun (proms, etc.) while her much-younger sister got all the experience (and then ran off and married outside the community) that I was ready to scream as loudly as the author has the characters hollering.  To call the dialogue ham-handed is to give it more credit than it deserves.  And the main character doesn't solve the murder -- the murderer conveniently attacks her and then confesses, outlining all of the steps in the murder -- no brainpower needed at all.  Why bother?	2002-04-24

The characters are okay, but most of the book is taken up with a nonsensical diversion that has nothing to do with the real murders and the actual solution comes out of left field, which to me is the cardinal sin of mysteries.  If crosswords are your thing, I'd go for the first couple of books in the Puzzle Lady sequence by Parnell Hall, instead.	2002-04-16

It's unfortunate that writers, particularly mystery writers, can't seem to bring a series to a conclusion before they run out of inspiration -- and plots.  Again, Brown wraps up the plot neatly in the last few pages using information never divulged in the book -- is the mystery why anyone bothers to read a mystery that can't be deduced from the clues present in the book?  And again, the animals get all the best lines.  It would help if the humans got as much character development as the cats, dog, and horses (not to mention the owl and the blue jay!)<br />And where's an editor when you need one -- to remind the author that her main character has always been a blonde?<br />Bottom line -- not worth the time or the money.	2002-04-02

The mystery keeps you turning the pages, but I agree with the other reviewers that Benni is the empty center of the book -- the &quot;supporting&quot; characters are far more interesting.  Benni never really comes alive; she's just an annoying twerp asking questions and jumping to the wrong conclusions, only to get rescued by the more interesting characters.  I was more concerned when her dog was missing that when she was seemingly being tailed by a couple who seemed to be more (or less) than they claimed.  I doubt I'll bother with the other books in the series, and I'm a dyed-in-the-wool mystery buff (and quilter).	2001-12-04

He's missing in action here), and moves their relationships along nicely.  However, there's so much going on -- the impending marriage of main character Melanie's brother and ravishing trainer Bertie (short for Alberta), the reappearance of Melanie's ex-husband, the move into judging for Aunt Peg, &quot;finishing&quot; Melanie's poodle's championship -- that the mystery seems more of an afterthought than the main event.  Also, there's not much mystery -- the pointers to the guilty parties are pretty pointed.  As always, the dog show segments are the most realistic, but the Christmas Eve chapter at the end is well worth the price of admission.	2001-10-30

There are red herrings aplenty, including a spurious digression about wife-swapping and lots of genealogy that goes nowhere.  Even the many chapters spent peeling away the layers of knowledge about the first murder victim turn out to be totally irrelevant to the resolution, which comes out of left field.  An unknown mystery tenant who turns out to be very important -- you won't know anything about the person's existence until the inspector and the investigator sit down to explain it all to us folks.  I prefer my mystery books to give me a fighting chance to figure it all out.	2001-10-30

She has a real eye for the telling detail and the apt turn of phrase.  Several of her vignettes (the Japanese lady in Paris, the futile attempt to learn Japanese in an intensive, formal course, the pilgrimage with her stepson) are small gems that linger in my memory.<br />The heart of the book, though, is not so much what Davidson saw of Japan but what Japan did to Davidson, and what she learned of herself from her trips there, and from her longing to steep herself in many aspects of Japanese life that even she acknowledges are more a fantasy of Japan than the reality -- a reality that she and her husband confront when they consider transplanting themselves to Japan.  This quandry -- I want to find my home, but where is it? -- is one that I think many of us will appreciate, and the solution that she and her husband reach is elegant and satisfying.  Although much of the book revolves around &quot;composite&quot; characters and institutions, every situation rings true.	2001-05-18

She manages to give a feeling of what life was like in such a different time period -- but she's done it before, and better, in some of her earlier books.  This time she's on a feminist soapbox about the treatment of talented women in an age when a woman's place was in the home (whether decorating it or scrubbing it) -- and she has her two continuing male characters, Oliver Rathbone and William Monk, delivering most of the (quite unlikely) feminist rhetoric.

However, when Winchester hits a groove, he can write wonderful, lyrical prose -- I loved the bit about his acquaintance, who printed a set of pages from his page-plate of the Dictionary.

On  that ground, Tey fails.  The ultimate solution comes out of left field,  makes a mockery of extensive investigation along many promising lines of  questioning, and leaves the reader wondering -- why did I bother?  If you  want to read Tey, read Daughter of Time, which is much livelier.

As an Army brat (I even spent a good part of the summer of  1963 in Beaufort, SC, where the story is set), I can hear the truth in  every line of dialogue between Josie and her war-hero husband, Bear.  It's  much more a story of a military family than it is of a Southern family, for  all of the local color, but it's well worth a first, second, or even third  read.	2000-05-25
