US	35733349	RYZASJ3ER62W9	0399152806	739064537	Superstition	Books	4	5	8	N	N	More than a paranormal mystery romance but still good!!	Location:  Pawley's Island, South Carolina.  This story opens in the past as a teenage girl, Tara Mitchell, is running for her life in the mansion of a friend.  She and her two friends were to have a sleepover but something has gone terribly wrong and someone is after her and she doesn't know why.  The opening chapter closes as she is brutally murdered.<br /><br />Vince Capra, the Mayor of Pawley's Island informs his fairly new Police Chief, Joe Franconi, that a TV crew is setting up in the old mansion and he wants them out of there!  The Mayor feels the publicity about a 15-year old murder/disappearance of 3 teenage girls will be bad for their tourist season starting the next month, June.  Joe is an ex-vice cop from New Jersey who was wounded and seems to have left the force under a cloud so he settled in the \\"peaceful\\" town to recover and reduce his stress.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Nicole (Nicky) Sullivan, a TV reporter for Chicago's \\"Twenty-four Hour Investigates\\", has returned home to help herself, her show's ratings and her mom.  Nicky's mom is Leonora James, a renowned psychic and medium.  It is the 15 year anniversary of the death of Tara Mitchell and the disappearance of her two friends.  Nicky has persuaded her mom to walk through the house with the TV camera in the live portion of her show.  Nicky's family is rather eccentric to say the least as it consists of her mom, her mom's third husband, her Uncle Ham, Uncle John, and her older sister, Livvy who is 7 months pregnant and separated from her two-timing husband plus various assistants and so on.<br /><br />Leonora tells Nicky she is \\"blocked\\" and doesn't want to go on TV, but Nicky persists and brings her mom and the gang to the mansion where her TV crew awaits.  Leonora is able to view what happened to Tara Mitchell and at the end of the broadcast, real screams are heard although no one knows the source.  Nicky follows Karen, one of her crew, who she thinks she sees outside on her cell phone.  Nicky herself is hit on the head and cut and dragged under the trees where she sees Karen's body.  She is rescued just in time by Joe and others who were on their way down the drive.  After this extremely close encounter with a murderer, Nicky is contacted by the murderer by phone and by email and for Nicky and the police, the hunt is on.<br /><br />I loved Nicky's crazy family and also Joe's friend Dave and his pig Cleo and Joe's \\"friend\\", Brian.  I felt Ms. Robards did an excellent job portraying the evil in this story that is involved in so many ways.  Some people might thing there was a mishmash with the mystery, romance, comedy, suspense and paranormal but I felt the author did a good job pulling it together.	2005-10-11

This is the third book I have read by this author and I have enjoyed all of them although this one has a lot more plot twists and turns.<br /><br />The main character, Jane Killian, is fifteen and cutting school when on a dare from her older half-sister and her friends goes for a swim in March 1987 in a lake in Dallas, Texas.  The water is frigid but Jane is exhilarated feeling that her sister Stacy and her friends will respect her now and not think her a bookworm or weakling. Jane even swims out past the swimmer's buoy to the boating side and sees a motor boat coming which first seems to turn away from her and then swerves and comes right at her.  She is hit by the propeller.<br /><br />We come forward to October 2003 and Jane has fallen asleep at her computer in her Dallas studio reliving that nightmare.  She wakes up to find her husband, Dr. Ian Westbrook, standing in the doorway to her studio asking if she is okay.  We find out that she has had extensive plastic and reconstructive surgery so that in spite of a fine scar along her jaw line and a glass eye in place of the one torn out by the accident, she is \\"beautiful.\\"  Her husband is also very handsome and they seem to be much in love.  Jane has just found out that she is eight weeks pregnant.  Jane is also an up and coming artist called \\"Cameo\\" who does sculptures and videos of women talking about fears, insecurities and so on.<br /><br />A former patient of Ian's is found dead in a hotel room.  Jane's sister Stacy, now a homicide detective with the Dallas PD is called to the scene with her new partner, Mac McPherson.  Evidence is uncovered that lead them to suspect Jane's husband, Ian, may have been having an affair with her and killed her.  They begin questioning witnesses and soon too Ian's office manager, Marsha, turns up dead as well.  Jane and Stacy's good friend and psychologist, Dave Nash, talks to Jane and tries to help her with her nightmares and suspicions.  Soon Ian is arrested, more bodies start popping up and more characters and suspects enter the story.<br /><br />While I found some of the police and forensic descriptions to be not as good as some mysteries, the plot did have great twists and turns as even the reader did not know who was behind it all until the end.  An exciting read!	2005-10-10
US	35733349	RE9FPPKEEMFTD	0399153063	770654598	Blue Smoke	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A detailed and gripping story from boths sides of arson investigation!	I love Nora Roberts' romance, mysteries, futuristic detective stories and magical stories.  This is one of her best mysteries.  It is not really a suspense as the suspense is for the main character not the reader.  It is a well written and graphically detailed journey into the mind of a murderer and arsonist.<br /><br />The story begins about 20 years ago in Baltimore in a predominantly Italian neighborhood.  Catarina \\"Reena\\" Hale, eleven and \\"5/6\\", is the third daughter of 4 children, oldest 3 are girls and the youngest a boy.  Her mother is Italian and her father \\"adopted\\" Italian.  Together her parents have taken over and run for the last 20 years the Sirico pizzeria that is just down the street from their home. Earlier that day, Reena was attacked by the neighborhood bad boy, 12 year old Joe Pastorelli, Jr.  Her brother Xander helped fight him off and later Reena's dad, Gib Hale, goes to talk with Joe Sr. where they nearly come to blows.<br /><br />In the wee hours of the morning,  Reena wakes up with stomach cramps which turn out to be her first period starting and goes outside with a ginger ale.  She sees some lights reflected in the front windows of Sirico's and walking closer realizes it is on fire.  She runs back to tell her parents who call 911 and help get their assistant who lives with his family above Sirico's out in time.  While watching the fire which Reena is fascinated with, she meets the arson investigator, John Minger.  He comes to the house the next day too and is kind in explaining what they look for.  The Police find evidence that Joe Sr. started the fire and they arrest him.  His wife looks battered - the whole neighborhood knows that he hits her - but she won't press charges for that ever.  The son, Joey, is angry and later that night his murdered and burning dog is on the Hale's lawn and Joey is also taken away.<br /><br />This is the start of Reena studying hard at school and then at college to become a police arson investigator.  In college, she meets a young man, Josh, dates him and brings him to her sister Bella's wedding and afterwards, he is burned to death in his apartment.  The police rule it accidental death from smoking although Reena never saw him smoke.  After college, she attends the police academy and does stints in firefighting as well and meets another young man who is murdered and burned to death in his car. (You would think she might think about these coincidences but at the time there is no reason to suspect.)  Finally, she works on the force and buys a home a couple of blocks from her parents.  She is now the only unmarried one in the family so when she is moving in and she and her family meet the young carpenter, Bowen \\"Bo\\" Goodnight, next door, they befriend him right away.<br /><br />Reena finds that she and Bo have a lot in common but now she is getting strange calls from someone who apparently knows her and is setting fires and threatening her family and friends.  This story becomes fascinating from the two view points:  the very sick mind of the arsonist and secondly, the police including Reena as the work out the clues and do research and interviews to finally find the killer.  A great read if a bit graphic for those not used to the \\"In Death\\" series.	2005-10-08

After the big battle under the mountain, the leader of the Varden is chasing down more of the Kull and Eragon is healing from his wound from the Shade Durza, the peoples in Varden, dwarves and humans, are coming together to clean up and fight and decide where to go.  The humans and dwarves emerge from one of the tunnels quickly followed by Kull who slay the human leader and many others before being driven off.  Eragon feels helpless as he has trouble using his sword and magic since his injury.  This injury seems to contain some of the evil of the Shade as it can cause his back such severe agony that he has seizures and passes out.  The leader's daughter, Nasuada , is nominated by the Varden Council of Elders to succeed her father.  Nasuada has Eragon and Saphira swear loyalty to her and sends them to the elven city of Ellesmera to receive more training.  Eragon also become a part of a dwarf clan so when he travels he is also accompanied by a guard of dwarves and his personal dwarf bodyguard, Orric.  Arya, the elf woman Eragon helped rescue, leads the way.<br /><br />The band has a few adventures on the way including finding some dwarves who harbor resentment for Eragon and his dragon but finally arrive in Ellesmera and meet the queen of the elves.  Much to their surprise they find out that Alya is her daughter and a princess.  Eragon begins training with the crippled elf Rider Oromis and his very old dragon Glaedr.  Oromis tutors Eragon in the ancient language including and especially writing it so that is becomes as natural to him as his native tongue.  Eragon also starts learning to meditate and more magic skills and spells and spars with another elf in the sword.  This is a painful venture for Eragon as his injury continues to cause seizures sometimes several a day, but he is also growing closer to Saphira as they learn to keep their minds open to one another to learn and share more.<br /><br />Back in Carvahall, a Ra'zac and soldiers from Galbatorix are attaching trying to capture Eragon's brother Roran.  Roran turns out to be quite a leader and fighter although he is unable to stop the Shade from stealing his fianc&eacute;e, Katrina.  Roran takes almost the whole village except a stubborn few to travel to Surda and join the Varden so he can find the Ra'zac and rescue Katrina.<br /><br />The two stories begin to merge as the big battle is fought and Eragon learns some disturbing personal news and re-meets and old friend.  I look forward to the third and purportedly final book.<br /><br />This is a fine first series by an up-and-coming young writer who should only improve with age and experience.	2005-10-07

I bought this hardcover at a bargain book sale - and WHAT A BARGAIN!!  I love Nora Roberts, Iris Johansen, Kay Hooper and other mystery/romance writers and now I love Erica Spindler!!<br /><br />The book begins with Pastor Rachel Howard peering out her window wondering if \\"they\\" are out there and rushing to her car, driving and crashing.  We get the sense that she is very scared and very desperate.  The next chapter introduces Liz Ames, her sister.  Liz has a weird message on her answering machine from Rachel telling her that Rachel has found something going on and that someone is watching her.  Liz believes her sister is in fear of her life.  Liz bugs the police in Key West but no one is interested and the police believe Rachel left on her own.<br /><br />Three months later Liz has made arrangements to bring her social worker practice to Key West and opens a small storefront on the \\"main\\" street in town.  Except for the police, Liz does not intend to tell anyone she is Rachel's sister so that she can get some answers.  Lt. Valentine Lopez tells Liz that even Liz's congregation at Paradise Christian Church said she had been acting strangely so he believes it is no wonder she ran away.  Even after Liz tells him about the phone message from Rachel, Lt. Lopez is just not buying into any sinister happenings.<br /><br />In the meantime, a vice president at a local bank jumps (falls?) to his death from his third story bedroom window and another bank employee is missing.  The new pastor, Pastor Tim, of Rachel's congregation does not seem very cooperative to Liz and on top of that a young teenage girl that Rachel had counseled and Liz had begun to see is found murdered in a ritualistic style after the infamous \\"New Testament\\" killer currently incarcerated.<br /><br />An ex-Miami cop who owns a bar, the young boyfriend of the murdered teen, and a shop owner enter the picture and provide support and clues as Liz struggles to find out what has happened to her sister and who iscommitting these murders and is SHE now in danger too??<br /><br />Very exciting with lots of plot twists and turns and surprises and some fun romance as well.

The first three books in this series were mainly about Axis, Azhure and Faraday and the evil Gorgrael with his Skraelings and so on.  They connected well although I thought as other reviewers that Axis was a bit less considerate of Faraday than I thought he should have been and that Faraday definitely got the short end (being turned into a doe after she finished her tree planting and never getting to raise her son, Isfrael).  Now 40 years later, Caelum Sunsoar, the eldest son of Axis and Azhure, is the head of  the three races of Icarii, Avar and humans/Achars.  The Icarii and Avar have their own rulers.  The humans/Achars are split between Zared, the herditary Achar king being Rivkah's son and Axis' half brother, and Askam who is also a son of Axis' general.  Each of them is a \\"Lord\\" and rules his own territory.  Zared, aided and abetted by the guild heads, some lesser dukes/earls and his love for Askam's sister Leagh, decides rather reluctantly to try to unite the people under him as king.  They meet at Caelum's palace where first Zared approaches Caelum about marrying Leagh - not going to happen as it would in effect do as Zared wants as Askam is childless.  Then Zared approaches the idea of one Achar nation again to match the Avar and Icarii races and this too is put down by Caelum and the Council.<br /><br />During this time we see Riverstar, Caelum's sister and twin to Drago (who was stripped of Enchanter powers when he tried to kill Caelum as an infant), having an illicit affair and then found dead with Drago at her side holding a knife.  We also have Zenith battling a the sould of Niah (Azhure's mother) who is trying to possess her.  Zenith (also sister to Caelum and Drago) is sympathetic to Drago and realizes she needs help to resist Niah and thus she and Drago escape the palace.<br /><br />This starts a series of adventures for them while also a civil war is started between Zared and Askam with Caelum coming in to fight on Askam's side but showing his immaturity in times of war.  Caelum seems a rather weak leader but morer will be explained in the next book.  Also how Drago and Zenith meet up with Faraday as a doe and her son and Drago goes threw the Stargate produces some exciting times.  I look forward to the next book!!	2005-09-26

Just as Regan Reilly is ready to leave Los Angeles for New York to visit with her parents and her fianc&eacute;e, Jack (no relation) Reilly, the worst snowstorm of the year hits New York and all flights to New York and other points on the East Coast are  cancelled.  Regan is disappointed as is Jack and her mom as they had plans to work on their upcoming wedding.  However, Regan's best friend Kit calls her.  Kit is in Hawaii at the Waikiki Waters Playground & Resort with and extra bed in her room.  She wants Regan to have a \\"bachelorette\\" weekend with her and meet her new love interest, Steve.<br /><br />Regan arrives and finds out that Dorinda Dawes, a newsletter/gossip columnist and photographer who works for the hotel, has been found on the beach.  Dorinda washed ashore and was found wearing a beautiful shell lei that belonged to a former Hawaiian queen and has been missing for thirty years from the museum where it was stolen.  The manager of the hotel, Will Brown, hires Regan to look into Dorinda's death as he doesn't think it was an accident as the police have ruled it.  Since her friend Kit is busy with her new boyfriend, Steve, Regan decides to take the case.<br /><br />Will Brown is anxious to be assured that all is well at the hotel as many pranks have been played and strange accidents lately.  Will does not want anything to interfere with an upcoming charity ball and auction where the twin shell lei to the one found on Dorinda is to be auctioned off.  Will is also very busy handing a strange tour group from Hudville.  The group is led by two elderly twin sisters, Ev and Gert, who are managing the monies left by a benefactor in Hudville to allow groups from that very rainy town to visit Hawaii.<br /><br />These are just a few of the crazy, likable and sometimes criminal characters the reader meets throughout the story.  This is LIGHT reading but a lot of fun trying to guess the villains and how Regan will solve the mystery.  These Regan Reilly stories are NOT serious mysteries but I find them to be more of a comedy with a little romance and detective work thrown in.  Just a light fun read!  Enjoy it for what it is!!	2005-09-23

First of all, I am an adult and 50-something parent who read the book to screen it for my 12-year old son.  While I agree with other reviewers that Christopher Paolini clearly \\"borrowed\\" ideas from Tolkien, Star Wars, Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" and other similar sci-fi/fantasy literature, my comment is, \\"So what?\\"  With the notable exceptions of Tolkien and Anne McCaffrey, I believe most sci-fi/fantasy all contain certain similar characters, races and ideas.  I have no problem with that as long as the story itself is good and well-written.  I have read hundreds of sci-fi/fantasy books.<br /><br />Eragon is a young farm boy whose name is the title. He lives with his uncle and his cousin,Roran, on a farm just outside the small village of Carvahall.  Eragon is good with his bow and is out doing the hunting for food for his family up in the mountains or Spine.  He is chasing after a wounded doe when he comes across a beautiful and huge blue stone.  It is highly polished and marbled and over a foot in length.  Eragon decides that since he couldn't kill their food, he will take the stone to the village and see what he can get for it to buy some food.  The butcher he goes to does not want to trade him meat for the stone even though winter is coming and Eragon's family would go hungry.  A kind friend, the blacksmith, comes in the shop and pays for the food but tells Eragon he can work it off in the spring and to just keep the stone.<br /><br />Roran makes plans and leave the farm in the next couple of weeks so Eragon is all the help that Garrow, his uncle, has.  Eragon has hidden the stone but takes it out frequently to look at it.  One day the egg hatches and a beautiful gleaming blue dragon appears.  From storyteller Brom and others, Eragon though dragons were no longer on earth.  Eragon makes the dragon a hideout up in a tree and orders it to stay in the woods while he goes to talk to Brom as Brom used to tell tales of dragons and the Riders.  Having learned from Brom a little more about dragons, Eragon names the dragon, who turns out to be female, Saphira.  Saphira is growing VERY rapidly.  Eragon and Saphira have also formed a mental bond.<br /><br />When the evil Ra'zac kill Garrow, Eragon's uncle, and destroy the farm, Eragon finds out from the Brom that the Ra'zac are after him and his dragon.  King Galbatorix wants to be the only Rider and not have his power threatened by another Rider.  Galbatorix had destroyed almost all Riders in the past on his way to power.  Brom accompanies Eragon on his flight to search for the Ra'zac that killed his uncle and learn more of his role as a Rider.<br /><br />Brom and Eragon have many adventures and battles as Brom trains Eragon in magic and in sword fighting as well as more of the history of his country.  Besides humans, dragons and Ra'zac, there are also elves, dwarves, Shades and rather primitive and violent humans called Urgals.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story myself and know my son will like it too.  I disagree with the publisher's age range, however.  I would recommend it for 12 year olds minimum.om a little more about dragons, Eragon names the dragon, who turns out to be female, Saphira.

She majored in forensic anthropology.  Some months before she had met Jeremiah Cortez, a Comanche Native American and federal prosecutor while he was working with her Aunt Derrie investigating some crimes against the environment.  They had been attracted by Cortez was concerned about the thirteen year age difference (So am I!) but he had promised to attend the ceremony so he was there.  He finds Phoebe near her Aunt and steals her away for a bit before he has to fly back to D.C.  He tells her of an opportunity for a desk job at the Native American center in Washington at good pay and she would be near him.  Phoebe has no interest in a desk job.  She loves being in the field and on digs.  Cortez looks at her fieldwork as a kind of grave digging.  They share some heavy duty kissing in his car in the hotel lot and he promises to stay in touch.<br /><br />We come forward to 1997 and find Phoebe as a museum curator of a small Native American museum in Chenocetah, North Carolina. We wonder why her Cherokee friend Maria is trying to fix Phoebe up with her cousin Drake, a police officer.  Phoebe opens her desk drawer and removes two envelopes.  One has a special prayer/protection piece from Cortez's father sent by Cortez three years ago.  She is told to always keep it with her.  The other envelope contains a simple newspaper clipping announcing Cortez's marriage to someone else!!  Even just looking at these items, Phoebe can feel the pain and grief.  Phoebe has decided to concentrate on her career.<br /><br />Phoebe receives a phone call from a man identifying himself as an anthropologist, who asks her if she knows anything about what he has found in a nearby cave.  This unknown man found a skeleton that he says appears to be  a Neanderthal.  Phoebe is very doubtful this could be true as no Neanderthal remains have every been found in North America. Before Phoebe can ask more questions, she hears a woman callto the man and he hangs up quickly on her telling the woman that he was just talking with his daughter.  The very next day this man is found dead on the Reservation and the FBI is brought in.  Specifically an agent from the new Indian Country Crime Unit who is none other than Jeremiah Cortez.<br /><br />As Phoebe helps the police and Jeremiah with her forensic anthropology skills, they grow closer together and his whole story of his marriage comes out including the fact that he is now a widower with a two year old boy.  I enjoyed some of the romantic tension and scenes and the detective part of the story held together fairly well.  An interesting and fun read but not too detailed or comprehensive either romance or mystery wise.	2005-09-13

They have been promised jobs in the United States.  They are all hot, tired, uncomfortable and very thirsty.  The men driving the van stop and tell them they must walk from here.  They are only allowed one drink of water.  Mila and her friend,  Anja, are trying to walk in shoes that are not meant for walking over boulders, rocks, desert sand.  They finally come to a road where two vans are waiting with four men.  The seven girls are told to strip - up to this point Mila really thought the woman in Minsk who promised them that jobs were waiting for them in America was telling the truth.  Girls that are too slow stripping are beaten.  One of the men shoves Mila into a van and locks it.  He says no one will want her as she is scrawny and also her face is swollen from being struck trying to protect Anja.  One of the men picks Anja for a test drive and afterwards though she looks beaten, Anja gets up and runs - she is shot in the back and killed.  No one will know from her old country what has happened to Anja just as, Mila says, no one will know what has happened to her - they just vanish.<br /><br />We go now in the story to the morgue and Dr. Maura Isles is doing an autopsy with a rookie police officer.  She is distracted a bit and when she begins completing the paperwork later that evening, she cannot remember which hip a tattoo was on and goes back to the cold room to look. After checking for the tattoo, Maura hears a sound and starts unzipping the body bags that have not yet been processed.  She opens the third bag and sees a young girl, pale with black hair and cyanotic lips (blue).  As she looks at her and tries to feel for a pulse or breath sounds, the girl's eyes pop open!!Maura begins CPR and calls 911.  The unknown girl, Jane Doe, is transferred to the hospital across the way.<br /><br />In the meantime, Homicide Detective Jane Rizzoli, pregnant and past her due date is testifying in court and ends up tackling the defendant which breaks her water so she is rushed to the hospital.  This is the same hospital that \\"Jane Doe\\" is at.  After a few hours and no labor yet, her doctor sends her down for an ultrasound and at this point the very exciting action begins as she and several others are taken hostage.  Jane Rizzoli's husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean, is trying to help the police talk to \\"Jane Doe\\" who also gains an accomplice that slips inside the police net.  However, some unknown government forces and political forces have other ideas.<br /><br />Dr. Maura Isles is trying to find out just WHO Jane Doe and her companion is and why they have made strange demands.  The story is ultimately about Mila, \\"Jane Doe\\" and who they are and who has created this situation and how powerful these villains are.  An exciting but also very touching story!	2005-09-12

Even though these are reprints, I had not read them the first time around so they were new to me!  I also love Nora Roberts longer novels and mysteries and her JD Robb novels of Eve and Roarke.<br /><br />\\"Local Hero\\" is a wonderful look at both the joys and problems of single parenting (Hester and her 9 turning 10 year old son Radley) and a great look at a man with a vivid imagination who is not afraid to still be a boy.  Hester is so conservative and uptight at first compared to Mitch Dempsey who is basically a slob.  Mitch is a comic book writer who just happens to write about one of Radley's favorite heroes.  He also has a big lazy mutt of a dog, Taz, who also has a part to play.  Hester is a bank manager and has been struggling to support her family and be a good mother to her son since her husband just up and left them over 6 years ago.  Her ex-husband, Allan, has only contacted her briefly a few times over the years.  Allan does not care about his son at all -- an unnatural father!  Mitch likes the boy and volunteers to watch him each day after school.  This is the begininning of a wonderful series of happenings in which Mitch \\"falls in love\\" with the son and also the mom, Hester.  Hester feels she likes maybe loves Mitch but just isn't ready for more than a temporary thing.  How Mitch makes himself her \\"hero\\" to fully win her love and commitment to marriage is a wonderful tender tale.<br /><br />\\"Dual Image\\" is about a very compassionate soap opera actress, Ariel Kirkwood, who is auditioning for a part in a made-for-TV movie written by Booth DeWitt.  The screenplay Booth wrote very closely parallels his own real life falling-in-love, marriage and break-up with the very scheming actress, Elizabeth Hunter.  When Booth meets Ariel he cannot believe she is going to audition for the part of Rae (ie Elizabeth Hunter) as she appears warm, loving and friendly.  Booth is astonished at her first audition how she can turn into Rae right before his eyes.  He believes atfirst that make her just like Elizabeth.  How Ariel falls in love with Booth as she sees that he needs her love and warmth and convinces him that she is who she appears to be and not his ex-wife is a very warm and tender story.<br /><br />Both stories are fun reads for what they are!	2005-09-12

The book is a kind of sequel to \\"Split Second\\" where we met two ex-Secret Service agents, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell.  They team up to solve a mystery regarding HER kidnapped politician and end up solving what happened to Sean as well.  While not romantically involved at this point, they are a fun team with lots of chemistry.  At the end of  \\"Split Second\\" Michelle persuades Sean to abandon his small law practice and for a private investigation firm.<br /><br />Our story begins with a man lugging a woman's body into the woods in the pouring rain, posing it, putting a watch on it.  We don't know who he is or who the murdered woman is.  Early the next morning, Michelle is doing her usually run around the lake and woods surrounding the small town of Wrightsburg, Virginia. She sees two young boys come running and falling down a hill in a panic so she goes to investigate and finds a woman's corpse.  She uses her cell to call police and Sean.  Todd Williams, the sheriff, calls in Sylvia Diaz, the medical examiner.  Michelle, Sean and Todd all notice that the watch on the woman and the pose is like the infamous \\"Zodiac\\" killer.  The watch time is point to 1 o'clock and has been stopped.<br /><br />Sean tells Michelle that they need to go see a lawyer, Harry, who wants them to investigate a burglary at the mansion of a very rich family in town, the Battles.  Harry's client, Junior Deaver who has been doing handyman work at the Battles' home, is accused of the crime and there is a lot of circumstantial evidence.  Harry believe Junior is innocent.  As Sean and Michelle begin to question members of the Battle family and Junior and his family, a young high school couple if found dead.  The weapon was a shotgun and again the watches are set to 2:01pm on the girl and 3:00pm on the boy.  A dog collar is also found in the car - this is now like the Son of Sam killings.  Who is this murderer who is imitating other famous serial killers and why is he doing this?<br /><br />Next alady lawyer is killed and a watch on her is set to 4:00pm.  She is killed in such a way as to resemble yet another infamous murderer.  The police are getting stumped and the FBI in the form of agent Chip Bailey comes in to help.  Chip Bailey is a friend of the Battles and in fact helped rescue Eddie Battle from kidnapping when Eddie was in college.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I enjoyed all the twists and turns and trying to figure out what was going on.  I love a challenge!!  The unveiling of the people in the Battle family and meeting others in the cast of characters was very fascinating.  Sean and Michelle's \\"discussions\\" and fun opposites (he's extremely neat - she's a slob, for example) and the emergence of Sylvia Diaz as a former romantic interest of Sean's all made for some interesting plot twists.  A great read that was hard to put down!	2005-09-09

FBI agent Ruth Warnecki is an avid treasure hunter and has a map she bought at an estate sale leading her to Winkel's Cave in Maestro, Virginia.  According to what she sees there should be some gold bars in the cave.  She comes to where in the cave there should be an arch but it has been blocked in.  She is able to dig through as it is mostly soft dirt and shines her light in a huge chamber.  Before she can look further for the gold she hears hissing sounds and gets dizzy and starts hallucinating until she blacks out.<br /><br />In the meantime back in Maryland, the FBI team of Savich/Sherlock with Dane Carver and other agents and local police have surrounded the Hooter's Motel following a lead from one of Ruth's snitches.  They hope to find man named Moses Grace and his sidekick, Claudia, who kidnapped Pinky from the Bonhomie Club where agents Savich and Quinlan like to go to play and sing jazz with Miz Lilly.  After hearing some conversation with their long distance mikes and then some gunshots, Savich and Carver break into the room only to see a red light flashing.  They quickly warn everyone and jump off the second story outside walkway just as the bomb explodes.  They are led again by the snitch to Arlington Cemetery where they find Pinky dead and they also get shot at.  Moses Grace calls Savich's cell phone and mocks him and threatens him and especially his wife, Sherlock.<br /><br />Back in Maestro, Virginia,  Sheriff Dix Noble comes home to his two teenage boys and they let the dog, Brewster, out who begins barking in the woods. The Sheriff brings her to his home.  She has a gash on her head and can't remember who she is or where she was.  He fingerprints her and takes her picture and in the meantime, Dix and his boys, Rafe and Rob, take care of her.  Savich and Sherlock see her picture over the wire and just as they arrive at the Sheriff's house, Dix receives a call and tells Ruth her name.  She is very happy to see Savich and Sherlock and recounts what happened to her in the cave.  They all go the next day to see what is there but someone has caused a cave-in and blocked the way.  Dix takes them to his father-in-law, Chappy, who knows the area well.  Chappy leads them to a back way in and Ruth recognizes the chamber as the one she was in.  They find the recently murdered body of a young girl who is later identified as Erin, a violin student from the nearby Stanislaus College, a music school like Julliard.<br /><br />When Sherlock and Savich leave to pursue the latest leads on Moses Grace and Claudia,  two mean fire into Dix's home into the bedroom where she is at trying to kill her.  A car chase ensues and the two men are killed when their truck explodes.  Going back and forth between the two very exciting and suspenseful stories keeps the reader's interest very well.  The only thing that disappointed me was that the disappearance three years before of the sheriff's wife, Christy, was not resolved.  It was resolved emotionally in that Dix and his sons accept that she must be dead.  I hope that is resolved in a future book!	2005-09-07

Unlike other reviewers, I love the two sides of Lt. Lindsay Boxer of the San Francico PD.  I think being tough on the job but vulnerable and romantic in her personal life meshes very well.<br /><br />The book begins with Lindsay jogging on a Sunday morning with her friend Jill Bernhardt who is an Assistant District Attorney for the City of San Francisco and part of the group of 4 in the Women's Murder Club (the other two being Cindy, a reporter, and Claire, a medical examiner).  Lindsay notices some nasty finger-sized bruises on Jill's arm but Jill claims she banged into a doorway (heard that one before).  Jill departs from their run and Lindsay continues on home past some of her favorite beautiful townhouses when suddenly one blows up!! She is quick to call 911 and identify her self and the location.  Next, Lindsay grabs her shirt over her mouth and runs in to see if anyone is left alive.  She sees a couple of adult bodies and keeps going through the home.  Lindsay hears crying and finds a young boy under his bed.  She rescues him but sees no one else.  The townhouse it turns out is owned by a CEO who cashed in on his stock big time.  Soon another person is targeted and killed by this group, August Spies, this time by ricin poisoning.  The FBI, Homeland Security and all the top guns are brought in to help solve this as a big G8 economic meeting is to take place in San Francisco very soon!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jill confesses to Lindsay that her husband Steve has been hitting her for some time.  Lindsay goes nuclear and confronts him in his office -- not a good thing!!  Lindsay also tells Cindy and Claire and all four of them meet to give their support to Jill for whatever she decides to do.  They are all saddened to see their friend who seems to strong and on top of things in such a vulnerable position.<br /><br />With subplots involving the reader getting some first person accounts from some of the \\"August Spies\\" gang and a building love interest between Lindsay and Joe Molinari, Deputy Director of Homeland Security, the story is packed with suspense, action, mystery and romance.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it and consider it more than a \\"beach read.\\"	2005-08-31

D.C. has moved back to the Washington, DC area from California and other places.  Being an artist, he does love to move around and has finally come back to Washington, DC where he mostly grew up in the White House.  D.C. is sloppy and in the few months he has been back has not even finished unpacking.  He often forgets to eat or wash dishes or do laundry unless he has to!!  His grandfather calls him and asks him as a favor to his godmother and Daniel's friend to escort Layna to a charity dinner.  In the meantime, Layna's godmother/Daniel's friend is telling Layna that D.C. needs a date to this charity dinner and would she please let D.C. escort her?  Layna is unsure of herself and not warm, loving and passionate like D.C. as he grew up in a home and extended family filled with love whereas Layna parents carried on a \\"civilized\\" marriage of basically keeping out of each other's ways and having affairs as long as they were discreet.  Sparks fly when they meet and dislike each other on sight.  A wonderful story.<br /><br />Duncan Blade is the son of Justin Blade and Serena MacGregor who together own several hotel/casinos in places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City.  He is part Comanche as well and has setup recently a riverboat called the Comanche Princess to go up and down the Mississippi with guests coming to stay for one port-to-port hop or for a whole week's run.

The first book I read by Nora Roberts were Serena, Caine and Alan  MacGregor's stories of meeting their prospective spouses, Justin Blade,  Diana Blade and Shelby Campbell respectively.  I was quite excited to see a story about a new generation of MacGregor's and thus revisit Daniel (\\"The MacGregor\\") and his lovely wife Anna.  Daniel acts like a real patriarch and curmudgeon but is really a softie.  He is so in love with Anna (I highly recommend their story if you haven't read it!) and he dearly loves his children and now grandchildren so you know he only wants the best.<br /><br />His oldest three granddaughters are cousins and share a home in Boston.  The MacGregor decides it is time for them to think about getting married and to provide a \\"good prospect\\" for each of them.  It is up to them whether anything more happens but he tries hard to match them with a man who will complement their personalities and style.<br /><br />The first to be \\"matched\\" is Laura MacGregor, daughter of Caine and Diana, and a newly passed-the-bar lawyer herself.  She works at her parents' firm.  Daniel calls her early in the morning to let her know that a \\"present\\" is coming by.  She is sleepy and doesn't get it so just goes about getting ready for her day in her sleep attire of T-shirt and boxer shorts.  Royce Cameron, a security expert and ex-cop, knocks on the door, rings the bell and finally lets himself in with a key Daniel gave him assuming no one is home so he can look over the place for a security system.  He comes upon Laura in the kitchen with headphones on singing/screeching along to a song and admires the rear view.  He startles her and she grabs and knife before he is able to get her to take off the headphones so he can explain who he is.  That is the start of a very funny relationship as they do seem to strike each other the wrong way for a bit especially as Royce is not too fond of lawyers that defend criminals.  This was a very lovely story and a lot of fun.<br /><br />The next granddaughter is Justin and Serena's daughter, Gwendolyn Blade.  She completed medical school early and is working on a surgical residency and currently doing a shift in the ER.  Branson Maguire is a well-known author of detective novels starring a male character named Scully.  Daniel recommends, of course, he talk to Gwen when Branson wants to do a story with Scully involving a female murderer who is also a doctor.  I loved Branson as he sends her 3 dozen roses to soften her up - works for me!  As Gwen and Branson spend more and more time together - he basically is following her around at home, shopping and at the hospital - the attraction grows.  The tough part is for them to admit they are in love and want to be married.<br /><br />The third story is about Julia MacGregor who was the First Daughter when her dad, Alan MacGregor was President.  She buys homes and small flats and rehabs them and sells them.  She has worked with her favorite construction company manned by Michael Murdoch, a friend of her grandfather's.  She knows of his son, Cullum, but they are both very strong personalities and thus avoid each other as much as possible when he is on her jobs.  Michael Murdoch and The MacGregor get in cahootsr to push them together for longer as Michael swears to Daniel that he has seen \\"sparks\\" flying off both of them.  To do this, Michael pretends to have a cold and so makes Cullum go in his place to meet with Julia.  They end up working together constantly and arguing and betting and conceding and so on but the job they are doing on the lovely home in Boston that Julia purchased becomes a real labor of love - for both of them!!<br /><br />Very romantic and satisfying stories all three.	2005-08-21

Kaitlin and Lana are identical twin sisters whose parents are deceased and have been estranged for most of their adults lives.  Lana pops in and out of Kaitlin's life when she needs something or bragging or whatever.  The last time Kait, who is a vice president in a public relations company in Manhattan, saw Lana was seven years ago.<br /><br />Lana calls Kait and says she wants to meet her at a small local restaurant/coffee shop.  Kait who longs for the closeness of family and loves Lana agrees to meet her.  Lana tells her she is in very deep trouble as she was trying to \\"rescue\\" her husband's horse farm from bankruptcy and borrowed money from the wrong people.  She asks Kait to switch places with her for just two days while she \\"deals\\" with the loan shark.  Lana assures Kait that Trevor/Trev Coleman, her husband, is out of town.  Lana also tells Kait that she has a four-year old daughter, Marni.<br /><br />Kait is anxious to meet her niece as she loves children and always wanted to get married and have a family so she agrees since it is \\"only\\" for two days and she won't need to fool Lana's husband.  Kait dresses as Lana and they switch all clothing and identities and cars and off she drives to the small town of Three Falls, Virginia.<br /><br />Of course as the reader might guess, Lana's husband Trev is NOT out of town.  In fact, Kait barely gets in the door and he hands her divorce papers.  He and the housekeeper are obviously very antagonistic towards Lana.  Even a man at the stable seems mocking.  Marni, Lana's daughter, also seems afraid of her although Kait wins her over thus garnering even more distrust and suspicion in both Trev and the housekeeper's eyes.<br /><br />Kait knew that Lana always had men trailing after her but she is appalled as she finds out the extent of Lana's philandering while married to what Kait thinks is the ideal husband!!  Kait loves horses and goes riding only to get shot at - although none seem to believe her.<br /><br />More and more twists and turns and threats to Kait as Lana occur.  As all the devious schemes and plots are uncovered and Kait is trapped much longer than two days in Three Falls, I kept wondering why Kait didn't just tell the truth?  If I found out my sister was as evil as hers, I would turn her in no matter how much I loved her as I think that would be the better thing for her!  That was my main problem with the story is that Kait - even after getting very \\"close\\" to Trev-STILL doesn't confess!!  Frustrating!!<br /><br />The final conclusion and epilogue did disappoint me somewhat although at least Kait ends up happy but not through what I would consider the best of circumstances.  An exciting if a bit frustrating read!	2005-08-19

The story opens with Ben Tierney, a freelance writer, standing over a newly dug grave having found four others on Cleary Peak, a mountain in the small town of Cleary, North Carolina.  A snow and ice storm is starting so he hurries off the peak down to the road to his car - which won't start!  We don't know why he is there.<br /><br />Lilly Martin and Dutch Burton, chief of police in Cleary, are completing packing up their remaining belongings from the mountain cabin on Cleary Peak they owned.  The cabin is sold.  Lily and Dutch are divorced primarily due to Dutch's womanizing ways and some tragedy they faced together that we will find out more details later in the story.  Dutch does not want to lose Lilly but it is too late.  For Lilly the love and attraction has gone out of the marriage after being hurt by Dutch so many times.  They hear the storm coming and Dutch urges Lilly to leave right away.  She encourages him to leave first since as police chief he will need to be in town to help.<br /><br />Lilly is so exhausted after Dutch leaves she falls asleep for an hour (or so) and hurries out to her car slipping and sliding on the ice.  The car windshield take a bit to defrost especially with the driving sleet still coming down.  Lilly begins very, very slowly driving down the switchback roads down the mountain.  She does not get very far before she comes around a curve and suddenly a man is in front of her.  Lilly forgets the rules of a slick road and hits the brakes.  The rear quarter panel of her car hits the man and she hits a tree.  The man is Ben Tierney and his head is bleeding badly and he apparently has some other injuries.  Lilly helps him back up the mountain to her cabin and gives him first aid.  After he feels better he goes out to the toolshed to get some wood for the fireplace since they know the propane tank will give out eventually as it wasn't filled for the winter due to the sale.  Even though Ben does not feel well and is bleeding, he insists on being the one to make several trips to get the wood from the toolshed.  While he is out, Lilly tries calling Dutch's cell phone to let him know there's been accident and that Ben is injured.<br /><br />Dutch gets just enough of the message later that night to make him crazy.  There have been 5 women who have disappeared in the last year with no apparent connection to each other. He and his friend, Wes Hamer, try to get a drunken snowplow/sand truck driver Cal to get them up the mountain.  They end up sliding back down and have to give up at least until daylight.  In the meantime, the FBI comes to town trying to find the unsub they nicknamed \\"Blue\\"  and researching anyone who was in the area at around the same time as the disappearances go to Ben Tierney's guest cabin and find a room with pictures and notes about each disappearance tacked up on a board.  They ask the police about Tierney and next thing you know the whole town knows he is a suspect!!<br /><br />I enjoyed the adventures that happen and also the troubles and development of secondary characters such as Marilee Ritt, a school teacher, and her brother William, the town pharmacist.  I also felt a lot of sympathy for Wes' son Scott.  I enjoyed this book very much!	2005-08-18

I really enjoy Suzanne Brockmann's novels and especially this \\"series\\" about some FBI agents, a Seal team, and the \\"Troubleshooters, Inc.\\".  This novel was a little harder to read as it not only skipped around in place, it skipped back and forth in time.  I enjoyed getting to know Jules Cassidy in Hot Target and we get to know him even more in this story.  To me, he is the real hero along with Gina Vitagliano.  If you've read previous novels in this series you know that Gina and FBI agent Max Bhagat have this really weird on/off relationship.  He has a couple of main issues with why he can't seem to tell her he loves her with the age difference being just one of them.  We get to find out more about him and his \\"issues\\" in this story which is part of the cause of the time jumping.<br /><br />Max believes that Gina is with her best friend Molly in Kenya working at a special camp to help with AIDS and other relief work.  While at work, Jules comes in and is told by another agent that he is elected to give Max some very bad news.  There was a terrorist car bombing in Hamburg, Germany and Gina is among the dead.  This news hits Max very, very hard and after seeing that Gina's family is informed, he gets a ticket to head for Germany to identify her body and bring it home and perhaps find out about what went down.  Jules insists on accompanying him - Jules is a great friend to Max here and this plays out rather funny.<br /><br />When Max finally gets to Germany and the morgue at the airport, he and Jules discover that although the body looks much like Gina and has her passport - it is NOT Gina.  Thus begins some real FBI detective work!!  The reader does not know much of what happened either as when we last left Gina, she was in Kenya and her friend Molly's \\"boyfriend\\", Leslie known as David known as Grady Morant, has shown up in the camp in disguise.  To help a young Kenyan girl trying to escape a horrible mutilation ritual, they get married by a priest in the camp.  Theysave the girl but also find out Molly has a lump in her breast.<br /><br />The plot is very complicated especially with the time leaps but I really found it fascinating and with the adventure, romance and humor a great read!	2005-08-15

His wife died some years ago, his daughter, Sayre, left home ten years ago but he has his oldest and favorite son, Chris, and his youngest, Danny.<br /><br />Chris and the family and foundry's lawyer Beck Merchant are watching sports on a Sunday afternoon when the sheriff comes to tell them and Huff that Danny has been found at their fishing shack dead of an apparent self-inflicted shotgun blast to the head.<br /><br />Huff is nearly knocked down with grief.  The longtime housekeeper Selma and others reach Sayre in San Francisco.  She returns to Destiny for her brother Danny's funeral. She believes as does Huff, Beck and Chris, that he committed suicide.  What she doesn't tell anyone is that she had refused to take a few phone calls from him over the last two weeks.  She did not want ANY contact with her family.<br /><br />When she goes to the cemetery later after the funeral, Sayre meets Danny's fianc&eacute;e.  Sayre did not know that Danny was engaged to a young woman he met at a new Baptist church he was attending.  The young woman lets Sayre know that she does not believe Danny committed suicide but that he did have something spiritual or moral that was weighing on his mind.<br /><br />A young deputy in the Sheriff's office believes that it was a homicide not suicide and find some supporting evidence.  He insists in spite of Red, the bribed-by-the-Hoyles sheriff, on interviewing Chris and casting suspicion upon him.  Chris casts suspicion on a man named Slap who was recently released from jail and refused a job at the Hoyle foundry by Danny.<br /><br />Besides the murder, there is a lot of trouble at the foundry as more complaints by employees and outsiders trying to unionize.  The foundry is a death trap and has frequently run afoul of OSHA but the Hoyles bribe inspectors and have so far managed to avoid making needed repairs and improvements that would be extremely costly.  Sayre sees Beck Merchant as her father and Chris' right hand man and cohort.  She does keep running into him and they have a physical attraction that takes time to develop.<br /><br />I found this to be a very interesting story with a lot of twists and unexpected surprises with the romance mostly secondary.  A very intense read!	2005-08-11

The book begins with an old woman in a truck who is being followed as she heads to her remote cabin in near desert outside of Palm Springs.  She gets to her shotgun and when the man knocks on the door and offers her two million dollars for the \\"Book of the Learned\\", she tells him to leave.  Then later at sunset the man comes back unknown to her and throws homemade napalm bombs in the cabin and the old woman is burned to death.<br /><br />We switch to a year later and Serena Charters is in Morton Hingham's law office.  Her grandmother was the old woman in the cabin.  He gives her the deed to the land where her grandmother's cabin was and 4 illuminated manuscript pages from her safe deposit box.  Mr. Hingham recommends House of Warwick and Erik North to appraise the pages.  Serena is a textile weaver artist who does commissions and is also starting to become known in the artistic community.  She send color photocopies to both places and goes to see Mr. Warwick of the House of Warwick and that is where the excitement begins!!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book as there was so much detail and information and description.  If you don't like detail and just want the nitty gritty suspense and romance, you many not enjoy this book as I did.  Also the unusual flashes of the past that both Erik and Serena have added some very interesting elements and also added to both of their unwillingness to trust one another.<br /><br />All dots were connected very well for me.  I recommend it!	2005-08-08

I don't know why some reviewers did not like this book in the SCU/Bishop series.  I really loved it.  Lots of thrills and chills!!  The story begins 25 years ago in Leisure, Tennessee at The Lodge where a young girl is hiding in a closet and hears something evil coming but can't tell if it is inside her or outside the door.

The first book in this historical romantic fantasy series was about Duncan Macrae and Gwynne Owens.  They had a friend, Simon, Earl of Falconer, who is a very powerful mage and an enforcer for the Guardian Council.  He had some tough things to do in that book.  This story is continuing where Simon had discovered during the Jacobite rebellion that some rogue mage was \\"helping\\" BOTH sides stirring up the unrest and increasing loss of life.<br /><br />That mage is Lord Drayton.  Guardians are humans with special powers and responsibilities and they take an oath to not interfere in the \\"mundane\\" world (non magical).  Lord Drayton has violated that so Simon Malmain is going to confront him and possibly strip him of his powers.  Simon knows of Lord Drayton as they are both members of the Royal Society, a society of mathematicians, inventors.  Simon knows that Lord Drayton has only moderate power so he believes he can handle him alone.  However, Lord Drayton is expecting him and has laid a trap with his power enhanced by a woman he holds in thrall.<br /><br />Simon turns into a unicorn and is about to be killed by Drayton but manages to escape  aided by a servant, Meg.  Meg seems rather slow to the other people in the castle and very homely.  Lord Drayton tries to use Meg who is a virgin to trap Simon in his unicorn form so he  can kill the unicorn and have its horn which possesses a great deal of magical and healing power.  Meg is an animal lover and seems to be able to mind-talk animals.  Simon is drawn to her as unicorns are attracted to virgins.  She sees the trap and runs with him riding on his back.  When they are far enough away, she sees he is bleeding from a wound and tries to stem the bleeding with her hand that has a cut in it.  When her blood and his mix, Simon is returned to human form, albeit naked.  They go to a nearby home of Lady Bethany Fox, also introduced in the previous book, who is on the Guardian Council.  Simon also discovers that Meg is a beautifulyoung woman who was bespelled by Lord Drayton for ten years.  He is only able to tie off the magical cord that Drayton has on Meg but is able to remove the spell that changed her appearance and blocked much of her mind.  Meg cannot remember her past however, that is still blocked.  Lady Bethany gives them aid and suggests they marry to stay together in case Simon turns back into a unicorn.  They are both against marriage for different reasons but do agree to pretend they are married so they can go to London and find a way to stop Lord Drayton.<br /><br />Ms. Putney has advanced the start of the Industrial age a bit for purposes of the plot line but it works well nevertheless.  The secondary characters such as Sarah and David White and some of the other Council members such as Lord Sterling and also the others Lord Drayton holds in thrall are nicely developed and make the story interesting.<br /><br />The romance is also well done especially since they must remain chaste so that Meg can help Simon when he loses his temper and turns back into a unicorn!<br /><br />A fun and lush romantic fantasy!	2005-08-04

I am a fan of the Prey series and have also read one other of the Kidd series, Devil's Code.  The Kidd series is alot of fun in that it is more irreverent since the main character while a legitimate artist is also a computer hacker and his friends are also on the very shady (black?) side of the law.<br /><br />The book opens with the reader knowing that a crippled black man is being murdered and his computer laptop stolen and if you read any other Kidd books, you suspect it is Bobby even before that is confirmed.<br /><br />The problems begin when Bobby's \\"ring\\" which includes Kidd, his friend and sometime lover, LuEllen, his friend John and others find out that Bobby is no longer available and find out his address and see that he has been murdered and his laptop stolen.  This laptop has info on it, the ring believes, that might get them in some deep trouble with the law.  The main three friends, Kidd, LuEllen and John are determined to find out who killed Bobby and get revenge as well as find the laptop.<br /><br />The crazy and dangerous things that they do and that happen to them in their quest to get the laptop and get Bobby's killer lead to all sorts of adventures and many humorous and scary moments.<br /><br />Is justice served?  Sort of.  Is the law happy?  Sort of.  But it is a satisfying story if not as good as the Prey series.	2005-08-04

First of all, I am an Iris Johansen fan and love most all of her work with very few exceptions.  Secondly, I was shocked to see a review of this book by an 8th grader!!  What is this kid's parents thinking?  These are NOT young people's books but adult mystery/romance.  Yes to some reviewers, Ms. Johansen does seem to follow a bit of a formula but I enjoy it.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this story as many of the characters are from her other novels of this type (John and Sarah Logan, Sean Galen, Judd Morgan) and we as readers got to learn more about them.<br /><br />This story begins at a mudslide and collapse of the Arapahoe Dam where photojournalist Alex Graham is taking pics and digging for survivors along side her friend and ERT worker Sarah Logan and her dog Monty.  It is exhausting work and depressing to see so many bodies and few found alive.  Alex receives a call from her editor to hurry and send in her pics and the issue goes to press in a few days.  After digging some more, she takes some shots around the work area and then decides it would be a good idea to get an overall view.  She has her friend Ken, the Rescue team pilot, take her up in his helicopter and get some aerial shots and also has him set her down on the opposite hillside from the dam.  She takes shot after shot going down the hill and into the trees for over an hour when she hears shouts and voices talking saying the name Powers and \\"let's go\\" so she starts coming back up the hill to the top where she sees a helicopter landing with no lights on landed and several men.  Suddenly come the lights of Ken's helicopter and she sees the pilot of the dark helicopter with a rifle and he fires and hits Ken's 'copter so that it explodes.  Alex screams and suddenly the men are after her.  They shoot at her but stop and say \\"Let it bury the b----!\\"  She runs down the hill toward the flood waters as her side of the hill suddenly seems to rumble and break apart.  She goes into the water and manages to get to a floating rooftop and the next thing she wakes up in the hospital!!<br /><br />Sarah Logan is with her and no one knows anything or saw the other helicopter.  Alex tells her and Det. Leopold from the police but they tell her no evidence of anything than an earthquake caused the second landslide and no evidence in the wreck of the helicopter that shows a bullet brought it down.<br /><br />Alex goes to the police station to look at mug shots with no results and starts on the way back to the dam with Sarah and Monty.  Monty starts barking at a car following them and someone in the car shoots Sarah who is driving and they go off the side nearly getting all of them killed.  Now John Logan is in the picture!!<br /><br />The rest is quite exciting trying to find out who, what, when, where and why with some romance between Alex and Judd mixed in.<br /><br />A great read!	2005-07-30

You can read this book two ways:  1-As a right-wing ranting or 2-As ONE PERSON'S opinion on what people are affecting Americans right now.  I read this book more the second way.  There are plenty of books out there that just rant and if you only glance at a couple of pages of this book (as I think some reviewers did), you might think that is all this book is.  However, I believe if you take some time and really read the book and Mr. Goldberg's reasonings for choosing the 100 people he lists, you just might get some insight or learn about educators, politicians and many others who you may not have heard of before.<br /><br />You don't have to agree with that all of the 100 listed people deserve to be on the list to get something from this book.  There are definitely a few that Mr. Goldberg has named that I personally would not have chosen, but again that is MY opinion and this is HIS opinion.  Without giving away the actual list and their \\"ranking\\", I would say that I would agree with many of his choices but his numbers 1-5 were not at all where I would put them.  Mr. Goldberg is a very experienced journalist and was well-respected right up until he spoke up about \\"bias\\" so he has some information and knowledge that many of us do not.  Reading his information on many educators and writers of educational textbooks, these are straight facts and much of it scary to me as a parent of six children.  I have seen some of what he talks about and can agree with much of it.<br /><br />I do think that Mr. Goldberg maybe gives too much credit for influence to some Hollywood celebreties that, at least in my small corner of the world, are not really looked up to.  But maybe he knows more how the public reacts than I do.<br /><br />Read the book:  You may laugh, you may cry, you may get mad but you also may learn a few things that you didn't know.  It can't hurt!	2005-07-27

I have really enjoyed it!!  Since I am half-British myself (my dad and his ancestors go back many years and all from England), I enjoy English period novels (and history non-fiction).  I have read many tales about the Scottish uprising and \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" but this is the first that really made you feel as the reader that you were there in that time.  From the opening pages of descriptions of Gwynne Owens and her attire and the library to the Scottish moors and the battles between the British royal troops and Scottish rebels, the detail was exceptional.<br /><br />This is a FANTASY so if you don't like fantasy or magic, don't read it!!  This books tells that there humans with mystical abilities to control natural forces and look into the hearts/minds of others.  They are called Guardians and are scattered throughout the world and ruled by their oaths of noninterference and by a Council.  Gwyneth \\"Gwynne \\" Owens'father has just died.  He was a Guardian and the head librarian for Lord Brecon, an English count.  Gwynne was his assistant.  Her mother, deceased, was a \\"mundane\\" or non-magical human so she is only half-Guardian.  At age seventeen, Gwynne has shown no signs of power but she has made herself an expert on Guardians and Guardian history.  She marries the elderly Lord Brecon at this request in a marriage of convenience and takes care of him and the wonderful library until his death when she is 24.<br /><br />A year later she is out of mourning and lives with Lady Bethany Fox, a very powerful Guardian and head of the Council, who is Lord Brecon's younger sister.  A friend of hers and Lady Bethany's, Lord Simon Falconer comes with his Scottish friend Lord Ballister to meet with Lady Bethany.  Lord Ballister is a powerful weather mage Guardian and has been on a tour of the Continent meeting at the Council's request with other \\"Families\\" of Guardians in other countries.  Upon seeing the Lady Gwyneth Brecon, Lord Ballister - Duncan Macrae, is entranced and compares her to Helen of Troy.  Gwynne is overwhelmed by his power and while feeling the attraction, pushes away from him.  Duncan persists and then is finally repulsed and going to go home to Scotland where is has been announced/rumored the Charles Stuart has landed.  The Guardian Council looks in a scrying glass and believes that Duncan will need Gwynne's balance or tip the scales in a possible civil war.  The Council and Lady Bethany convince Gwynne to give in to her attraction to Duncan and accept his proposal of marriage.  They are married very quickly and begin their journey to Scotland.<br /><br />The story is a lush romance plus a woman torn by love and her oaths and also wonderful descriptions of the people in the Macrae hold of Dunrath.  How everything is revealed and resolved is an exciting read and well detailed.  I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to finding more of Ms. Putney's books for sale!	2005-07-25

I have read several other Tami Hoag novels and loved them all but this may be one of the best just for the danger and suspense alone!<br /><br />The book starts with Jace Damon, a 19-20 year old bike messenger, racing to finish a delivery and getting the call from his friend and dispatcher, Eta Fitzgerald, to do a late pickup and delivery from a sleazy defense lawyer named Lenny Lowell.  Jace has done deliveries for Lowell in the past so he knows where to go.  Jace arrives to pickup the package and while waiting for the very drunk Lenny who is talking about his daughter, a law student, Jace wanders in the office looking at and picking up Lenny's old bowling trophy and handling other things.  Lenny tips him $20 which is a very big tip that Jace is grateful for.<br /><br />Jace takes off to deliver the envelope which due to the rain he has tucked against his chest under his T-shirt and jacket.  As he looks for the delivery address he realizes it is a vacant lot.  As Jace tries to decide what to do, a car starts chasing him and he is shot at.  He heads down alleys and his bike is wrecked by the car and he is attacked but manages to escape although his bike messenger bag is dropped.  He runs away and hides and finally the car leaves.  His bag is gone but he picks up the bike and starts heading toward Lenny's office to find out what was going on.  Why was someone trying to kill him?  It is some time before he gets near the lawyer's office when he stops at a gas station for some snacks.<br /><br />Meanwhile we are taken to the scene at Lenny's office where he is now dead with his head crushed by the bowling trophy.  Detective Kevin Parker is the lead with his trainee partner, Renee Ruiz who is a pain.  He is working the crime scene when two detectives from Robbery/Homicide elite division show up and try to tell him it is their case.  Abby Lowell, Lenny's daughter, arrives and states that a cop called her and told her to come over to the office.  The cop called her cell phone but no one recognizes the number although Parker writes it down and no cop on the scene called her or would have as that is not how the police notify relatives.  Then coronor's investigator, Diane Nicholson, comes on the scene to do her crime workup.  Parker is also trying to make his trainee understand how to take notes and so on.  They learn that Lenny had called for a bike messenger to take a package somewhere but they don't know which service or what.<br /><br />We also learn that Jace Damon, hurt, injured, wrecked bike, is an orphan with a ten year old brother, Tyler.  Jace lives in Chinatown and is sheltered by the Chen family headed by Madame Chen - a formidable Chinese woman.  Jace and his brother never knew their father(s) and their mother has been dead for nearly 8 years.  While she was alive they went from place to place always running, changing their names but yet Jace was not aware of his mother engaging in anything illegal but yet she taught him right from wrong but to NEVER trust the police.  Jace is now in a dilemma as he wants to do the right thing but he also wants to protect his brother and not have Child/Family Services take Tyler away from him.  This is the setup that starts Jace and Kevin Parker down the road to find clues and for Jace to nearly be killed again and people he knows and works with to be placed in extreme danger.<br /><br />I found the events leading to the climax to be suspenseful and exciting and loved the surprise ending!!

I read an excerpt from \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" in Nora Roberts \\"Out of this World\\" collection and have since been looking for that book or its sequel as it seemed from the excerpt to possibly be a fascinating series.  I am very disappointed with the book as a whole as it is definitely not my type of story.  Anita has sex with and or sleeps with too many guys and all of them either lycanthropes or vampires!!  She tries to show she has morals by not  having actual intercourse with all of them but to me that is naive, which she is not.  The sexual escapades and their descriptions are more pornographic than erotic and without any romance - a deep disappointment.<br /><br />However, I did enjoy the tracking down of a serial killer as that subplot was interesting although this time it was the violence and gore that were too graphic!<br /><br />If you like graphic violence and sex, you would enjoy this book.  I do not.	2005-07-23

This is a Regency England period story and 2nd sequel to \\"Slightly Shady\\".  Lavinia Lake and Tobias March are business partners in a very private and discreet investigating services as well as romantically involved in an affair - aided and abetted by both Lavinia's niece, Emmeline, and her housekeeper, Mrs. Chilton.  To try and have some private time together, they accept an invitation through their friend Lord Vale to Lord Beaumont's house party in the country.<br /><br />While Tobias is waiting at 1am for Lavinia to come to his room, an old but young and beautiful friend, Aspasia Gray, knocks on his door and wants to hire him.  She found that evening a \\"Memento Mori\\" ring (very morbid with a black casket and skeleton inside) and a note in her room.  Three years ago Tobias was involved in tracking down a copycat Memento Mori killer who was copying a killer for hire from decades earlier who took assignments only if he thought the target thoroughly deserved death. The man Tobias unmasked as the first copycat killer was Zachary Elland who had also been working with Tobias as a spy during the wars with the French.  Elland and Mrs. Gray were lovers and Elland committed suicide after March unmasked him.  Thus Aspasia wants Tobias to find out who is threatening her.<br /><br />Of course, Lavinia enters Tobias' room right when Aspasia hugs him so they look to be in a very compromising situation.  Lavinia leaves and tell Tobias not to bother coming to her room.  When Lavinia was on her way to Tobias' room she passed and hid from many other of the fine lords and ladies also going to assignations.  One elderly gentleman she passed was very much \\"in his cups\\" and hanging onto the tall blond maid who was taking his to the roof.  About an hour later, Tobias DOES come to Lavinia's room to explain that Aspasia is their new client and so they both begin to make love when there is a terrible scream and something falls past Lavinia's window.  It is the elderly Lord that Lavinia saw earlier so when a memento mori ring turns up in his room, Tobias and Lavinia know that it was murder and not an accident.  Their host, Lord Beaumont, disagrees and due to Lavinia's arguing tells them to leave.<br /><br />The ring and the blond hair, obviously a wig, provide the first clues as Tobias and Lavinia try to find the indentity of the killer.  They find other killings that are also suspicious and realize this killer is helping kill people so that some proposed marriages do not take place.  Without giving away the whole story, I thought that Ms. Quick/Krentz did a nice job dropping clues and leading the reader and the Lake/March pair to the killer.<br /><br />The romantic episodes between Lavinia and Tobias were better with less interruptions and also the side romances of Emmeline and Tobias' brother-in-law Anthony were well done along with the introduction of Priscilla on a more full basis and the new character Dominic Hood.<br /><br />One thing the reader wants to be aware that this is LIGHT reading and LIGHT mystery there is not a very intricate plot and there is some humor which I enjoy.  A fun book.	2005-07-23

At first the reader is unsure of the connection to the main plot but it will soon become apparent what nefarious activities are at the core of the subplot.<br /><br />Eve Dallas and Delia Peabody, partners, are investigating a celebrity murder case in which the murderer is a famous vid star who was severely beaten before she was able to kill her attacker.  They get a short interview with her at the Wilfred B. Icove Center for Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery as she will need massive surgery especially on her face to repair the destruction.  She confesses and it looks like a clear case of self-defense - case closed.  However, before they can leave the center's founder, Wilfred B. Icove, Senior, is discovered with a scalpel jabbed straight into his heart. His son,Wilfred Jr., also a surgeon at the center, is overcome with grief as is Wilfred Jr.'s wife, Avril, their two children and everyone at the center and around the country.  The senior Wilfred was known for his charity work, donations, work during the \\"Urban Wars\\" and other philanthropic acts.<br /><br />The security tapes show a beautiful woman as his last appointment.  She gave her name as Dolores Nocho-Alverez but this turns out to be a fake identity.  There follows much investigation by EDD - our favorites Feeney and McNab - as well as Roarke and Peabody and even Nadine Furst supplying valuable research.  But all they can get is some hints of affiliation with research labs and a college, Brookhollow Academy.  Eve knows something more is beneath the surface of \\"Dr. Perfect\\" as she doesn't buy it that anyone human is that perfect.  Eve gets a warrant to look at Wilfred Jr.'s home and computers and as she and her people from NYSPD get to the residence, they discover that the son has been killed the same way!  No tapes or vids or who or how.  The wife is in the Hamptons and well alibied.  The mystery has deepened but now coincidences and slowly moreand more clues are beginning to lead Eve, Roarke, and the rest of her staff on a journey of intrigue, lies, deceptions and the most outrageous of crimes.<br /><br />To lighten up this very dark and tough story is some family and comic relief, Roark has invited his newly discovered relatives, Aunt Sinead and brood, to have Thanksgiving dinner and stay for a few days at their home.  Eve is happy for him but she is not used to family or kids or babies so how she copes with them and they with her makes for some laughs.  I hope Ms. Roberts will give us the Thanksgiving dinner scene in the next book as I really want to know how that comes off with all those friends that Eve has also invited.<br /><br />The conclusion to the story was very satisfying and felt like the right thing had been done and justice served!	2005-07-20

She and a youngman from Finders go across the border and sneak around the church hiding on either side of a small graveyard watching a truck pull up.  While she is watching, she sees a body and maybe the man whom she injured 10 years ago and starts to get up when she is tackled and held with a hand tight over her mouth.  This is her meeting of the mysterious Diaz.  Through the first bit of the story it is hard to tell if he is a \\"good guy\\" or a \\"bad guy.\\"<br /><br />After some time and persuasion, Diaz agrees to help Milla find her missing son.  As they do this, more conspiracies and terrible crimes are revealed along with much danger to Milla and Diaz.  Some people Milla thought to be friends are not and the betrayals that she finds as she comes closer to finding her son are shocking.<br /><br />Ms. Howard ties everything up pretty nicely at the end with room for a sequel relating to a couple FBI agents.  I cried a lot at the end as Milla has some terrible decisions to make but she does the right thing!<br /><br />Hard to read without crying if you are a mother!!	2005-07-18

I started reading these books when my second youngest then 10 wanted to read them and I wanted to make sure they were appropriate for her.  I got hooked and have been reading them all and going to the movies (hate the new Dumbledore!!).  I thought the last book had Harry a little too whiny for my taste although he was brave in the end.  This time while Harry is despondent and depressed in the beginning he comes around and shows what a clever and intelligent young man he is.  Harry's adventures with Professor Dumbledore are outstanding and teach us alot about Dumbledore as well as the things Dumbledore is teaching Harry about Voldemort.<br /><br />We also see in this book where Harry is yearning to be a more \\"normal\\" wizard (Is that an oxymoron?) but that just isn't to be his fate.  This book also sees more of Professor Severus Snape and what he is up to.  Is he a spy for Dumbledore or Voldemort?  Whose side is he really on and is it resolved for sure in this book?<br /><br />A sacrifice by a major character is also outstanding as are Ron, Hermione and Ginny's support of Harry.  I hope the seventh book comes out sooner than this one and that we have some exciting adventures and resolutions with the good triumphing over evil.<br /><br />All in all these are fun to read for adults and great to have to share with your kids (if not too young!)!!<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-07-18

First of all, Carol Higgins Clark does not write dark, scary mysteries like her mother, Mary Higgins Clark.  The Regan Reilly series of which \\"Twanged\\" is part is humorous, light-hearted and a \\"whodunit\\" not a serious mystery or suspense thriller although there ARE serious dangers at times.<br /><br />In this story we find Regan Reilly heading to the Hamptons from her home in L.A. at the behest of a friend who has asked her to be a bodyguard to a new country singer, Brigid O'Neil.  Brigid has receive a very threatening letter plus back in Ireland her old friend Malachy had his fiddle stolen right from his home while he was sleeping!!<br /><br />Brigid is on her way to perform at the Melting Pot Festival sponsored by Welth College and the thumbtack heir,y Chappy Tinka.  Chappy wants to own the magical fiddle of Ireland's renowned fiddler and storyteller Malarchy Sheerin (Brigid's friend) that Brigid now has. Chappy has invited Brigid and her band to stay at one of his guesthomes on his estate in the Hamptons.<br /><br />Many scary stalker threats happen such as delivery of a doll with its head cut off and many very inept attempts at theft of the fiddle by Chappy and his assistant, Duke.<br /><br />This is LIGHT reading and alot of fun!!  Don't take is seriously and just enjoy the humorous situations that thieves, stalkers and our heroine find themselves in!	2005-07-13

Mr. Klein did some interviewing and quite a lot of research but alot of what is in this book is also in Dick Morris' book \\"Rewriting History\\".  Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, this book does have a few interesting facts that are pretty well documented on what Hillary knew about some scandals and when -- but I am not sure this is really new information for most people, friends or enemies of Hillary.  What IS new is the order and the way Mr. Klein presents this information with emphasis on Bill's philandering and Hillary politics.<br /><br />Mr. Klein did try to scare us a bit at the end by implying that the late Richard Nixon found her scary, but I am not sure if that would be enough or is really that accurate.<br /><br />I will say I am not a Hillary or Bill Clinton fan so I may be prejudiced in reading this book but I do feel that it does point out well as other books have that she is very smart in how to position herself and change herself to derive the best results for where she wants to be, i.e., First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the US, US Senator from New York, President (?).<br /><br />Whether you like her or not, the book is an interesting read for me mostly for who are her companions, supporters, etc.  I would like to see more information on them to be able to make more decisions on the type of person she really is.  She does seems to be able to sublimate her emotions and sexual needs in order to achieve the power and political standing she desires.  I also wonder even more after reading the book just exactly where she stands on some issues as she appears to change her views with the polls!	2005-07-12
US	35733349	RTS2CAINY9EWH	0060504153	115450821	Always Time to Die: A Novel	Books	4	4	6	N	N	A slower-paced suspense thriller.	U.S.  Senator Andrew Jackson Quintrell III is old and dying in a hospital bed in his library in his ranch home near Taos, New Mexico.  He appears to die of natural causes but we, the readers, know that someone \\"helped\\" speed the process.  No one is very sad about his death as he was one of the worst philanderers you can imagine and generally not a kind of person you might want to meet but very ,very powerful.  His son, Josh Quinetrell is governor of New Mexico, married to Anne who was an heiress and they have a son A.J. V who seems to take after the Senator and has alcohol and drug problems.  Governor Quintrell plans on being the next president of the United States.<br /><br />Enter Carolina \\"Carly\\" May, a genealogist and family historian, hired by the governor's Aunt Winifred to search out the Castillo family line.  Aunt Winifred is the Senator's wife's sister.  Sylvia Castillo Quintrell, also the governor's mother, has been in a coma and vegetative-like state since the 60's.  Winifred lives in a suite with Sylvia and helps tend her.  Winifred tells Carly that even if she dies, Carly will be paid to complete the Castillo family history.<br /><br />Carly gets started by going to the local Taos newspaper office to dig into some archives.  Gus, the editor, assigns his brother Dan Duran to help her since Dan was the one who created the computerized archive program.  Unbeknownst to Carly, Dan is related through his mother to the late Senator.  Dan is extremely worried about what Carly is doing especially when they find a dead and bloody rat on her pillow at the ranch guesthouse.<br /><br />More threats, deaths and accidents ensue as Carly with Dan's at first reluctant help, painstakingly starts putting the pieces together of the Castillo/Quintrell family lines.  This novel is slower moving in some ways than many other Elizabeth Lowell books but I think that it is appropriate as I know from experience that researching genealogy is a very time consuming and slow process.I did enjoy learning more about types of old photographs and how to order them chronologically and about DNA and mtDNA.<br /><br />An exciting and satisfying conclusion.  The romance was definitely secondary in this story!	2005-07-11

The locale is Bangkok, Thailand and the story begins with the dream or nightmare of Vincent Calvino.  Calvino is an ex-lawyer, ex-cop who does private investigation work - when he can get it.  He is a drunk and also uses whores, smokes, etc.  His dream is about a friend who was recently killed and in the dream someone is coming after him as well.  He wakes from this dream/nightmare at his apartment next to a Thai whore whose name he has forgotten - again.  That is because he was so inebriated he couldn't remember.  His housekeeper, Mrs. Jamthong - who is a hoot all by herself!, wakes him yelling at him that he is late for work and to come eat breakfast.  The prostitute leaves and Calvino (known to the Thais as \\"Khun Winee\\" since they can't pronounce the \\"v\\" for \\"Vinee\\") gets to the table to read the paper.  He sees a photo of a man slumped over a desk - dead.  His assistant, Ratana, calls and tells him to call her as soon as he is through with his meal.  He recognizes he knows the dead \\"farang\\" - white man or foreigner to the Thais.  He is a Brit named Ben Hoadley.  He gets to his office and finds that Ben Hoadley's father in England wants Calvino to investigate his son's murder.  The Thai newspaper reported that a \\"thinner addict\\" had done the deed.  Into his office comes Kiko, friend and romantic interest, who knows the thinner addict, Lek, and swears that he could not have done it.<br /><br />Thus begins an amazing string of events as Calvino works with Kiko, Pratt (a friend in the Bangkok police) and uncovers the motives and events of why first Jeff Logan and then Ben Hoadley and during the course of the story several others were murdered.  How Calvino gets to the resolution amid the extreme dangers he and others around him face is a fantastic tale of suspense, mystery, intrigue and the underworld.<br /><br />As a woman, I would say that Vincent Calvino is a true man's man and the kind of detective that men more than women would enjoy reading about.  The SpiritHouse is the first of the many novels that Mr. Moore has written about Calvino.  The details and descriptions are very image and thought provoking.  I highly recommend it!	2005-07-08

This novel is a sequel to \\"Don't Look Now\\" and has even more action and mystery and humor as well as the stuttering romance between the main characters. Clare Westbrook is a young defense attorney who has been raising her sister's daughter Emma and trying to cope with the slime and associates of those she defends.  Clare wants to only defend those clients who she believes are either innocent or have special circumstances.  In the previous book, Clare worked for a sleazy kind of guy who gets murdered.  She meets Tony (Antonio) Sonterra, a homicide cop, in the course of her adventures.<br /><br />This story centers around two main themes:  Clare is trying to set up her own attorney's office in a run down part of town and build up clientele without getting injured or worse herself.  Tony is trying to protect her.  The second theme is the mystery of who is stalking her and killing people around her and why and does it have to do with her law practice or Tony's cop business?  There are various secondary themes, some humor and romance with the main mystery being resolved and the romance MOSTLY decided.<br />Very exciting scenes and very scary scenes.<br /><br />I like variety in a novel and this fits the bill.<br /><br />Very much in the same vein as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.	2005-07-06

The story opens on January 1, 1985 in front of the City Hall in the small town of Pekesville, Kentucky.  Knox Davis, 15, is with his dad, owner of a hardware store across the street,and is avidly watching the mayor, councilman and others load a time capsule slated to be opened in 100 years.  The newspaper said 12 items were included but as Knox watches, he sees 13 items included before it is buried and the marble slab put on top.  Knox tell his dad this and they ask a news reporter but he did not see that or know what the extra item could be.  Knox drops the idea but since he is curious kind of guy, it stays in the back of his mind.<br /><br />In June of 2005, Knox Davis is now an investigator with the Sheriff's office and a deputy comes in to tell him there is a hole in the ground now right where the capsule was buried!!  Knox goes out and secures the crime (?) scene to see for himself.  No footprints - not a tiny clue!!  Knox watches security tapes from City Hall and from his dad's store across the way and all they show is a flash of white light.  Knox also receives a report from a cantankerous and whiny farmer that all of this tires on his tractor have been slashed and 6 of his chickens killed.  While Knox goes out to see him, the farmer reveals that he also saw \\"heat lightning\\" that night towards the woods.  Again, no evidence can be found and Knox is called to the scene of a strange murder.  One of the lawyers who was involved in the time capsule burial is found in his locked, secured and bolted home - with a spear through his chest.  A very strange spear!!  While Knox is investigating this crime along comes Nikita Stover who identifies herself as FBI and shows impressive credentials.<br /><br />Knox is no fool and checks on her and finds that the FBI does not have a Nikita Stover.  Who is she?  And perhaps more importantly, what is she doing there and what does she have to do with the murder and then murders of the local towns people who were involved in the time capsule?<br /><br />This is where the story takes its science fiction twist - I would not say paranormal as to me that is more on the ESP, ghost type of story - this is very definitely science fiction.<br /><br />How Knox eventually with Nikita's help investigates the murders and disappearance of the time capsule, how he finds out what/who she is, and how it is all resolved was a very interesting story with plenty of twists right up to the end.

The book starts out with a tale of a very young boy waiting in line with his mom and three-month old baby sister to see Santa Claus.  A familiar situation to any mom as the boy needs to go to the bathroom but won't say so as he doesn't want to miss seeing Santa.  The little boy gets up to Santa and is suddenly so scared he falls and wets himself.  His mom rushes up to gather him to her tenderly.  She stands up and turns around and her infant daughter is gone.  What a horrible tragedy!  I feel for that mom right away how devastated she must be.<br /><br />The story comes back to the present with a very old skull found while land is being turned over for a housing development.  When the skull is shown to be 5,000 years old, enter the expert archeologist, Callie Dunbrook.  Her boss and friend, Leo, brings her and a whole crew in to work on the Antietam Creek lands.  The owner and developer of the lands is not happy and neither are the workers he was employing to develop the land.  Leo also brings in Callie's ex-husband, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Graystone, as the lead anthropologist.  Some of this story is about the discoveries and how they are treated but along with it are two main sidelines:  murders that occur on the Antietam land and what connection, if any, is there between Callie and the infant girl kidnapped at the beginning of the book?<br /><br />Of course, we also have the romantic plot line as Jake tries to convince Callie that he is there for her.  All the complexities of this plot are well developed and woven seamlessly into this story with the emotions of the Dunbrooks (Callie's parents), the Cullens (whose baby daughter was kidnapped and may be her birth parents), her possible brother, Doug Cullen, and Callie herself.  We also have the follow up on who kidnapped Callie and why and how her adoptive parents were fooled.  Underlying this is the anger some of the people from the town of Woodsboro have towards the holdup of the housing development.<br /><br />A great read - hard to put down!	2005-06-22
US	35733349	R3DTP0SYWPO7EW	0765313154	987337909	Worlds of The Golden Queen	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Some very interesting and exciting tales!	I found this two-in-one book to be very fun and exciting but not quite as good as Farland's Runelords series.  The second story seemed to be unfinished and cry out for a sequel/conclusion.<br /><br />In the first novel, The Golden Queen, the \\"human\\" (Tharrin, really who are genetically enhanced and have been engineered by humans to be leaders) was defeated as was her Lord Escort, Veriasse by the insectoid Dronons and so the Dronons are taking over the ten thousand worlds over which she reigned. Lord Veriasse, her near-immortal consort who barely survived, has created a new queen: Everynne, cloned from the dead original. They are leaping from world to world via instantaneous transport gates.  The Dronons are trying hard to find them and are very close behind.  They come to a world where it is \\"backward\\" to the Tharrins and others.  It is like Ireland in the 19th century perhaps -- no electricity, phones ,etc. Everynne and Veriasse come to an inn where Gallen O'Day, a for-hire bodyguard and general wild lawman, is having an ale with Orick, a talking and intelligent black bear. Maggie Flynn who wishes to marry Gallen even though she is not quite 17, works the inn for John Mahoney.  Gallen immediately notices Everynne as she has pheromones that attact people, especially men, and she is very beautiful.<br /><br />Gallen goes off to escort a drunk friend home over the hills and is attacked by robbers and is outnumbered 12 to 1.  He is doing pretty well although the drunk is knocked out and he is injured but then a \\"sidhe\\" appears in black robes and lavender face mask and helps run off the rest of the robbers.  While Gallen is fighting, Orick sees a Dronon (though to him it is just a monster) trying to get into a window of the inn.  He sounds an alarm and attacks the Dronon.  More Dronons come and the village priest tries to hold them off but he is also killed.<br /><br />Luckily Everynn and Veriasse have already left for another gate and Gallen meets up with them and Maggie and Orick to give them escort to the gate.  Of course they end up running to it pursued by the Dronons and all of them go through to another world.<br /><br />It is on these other worlds that Gallen, Maggie and Orick learn through \\"mantles\\" more about the world and the marvelous machines in them and that their home world is very primitive in comparison.  They also decide to help Everynne and Veriasse defeaet the current Dronon Golden Queen's Lord Escort so that Everynne can become the new Golden Queen and reclaim the worlds for humans and other races to chase off the Dronons.  The Dronons want every race to be like them or serve them.  How the band of travellers arrives on Dronon and battles is the climax of this story.<br /><br />The second story or book is \\"Beyond the Gate\\". Gallen, Maggie and Orick are back on their home world to hide from the Dronons.  Unfortunately, their own people have become jealous and angered by what they perceive as Gallen's criminal behavior based on the testimony of a couple surviving robbers.  Gallen and Maggie finally get married after many trials and Gallen lets Maggie know that Everynne needs their help or at least Gallen's help for a trapped Tharrin woman on another world.  The three of them travel to this world and find the young woman, Cerravanne, who was once a leader of many of the races of people but now with help from the Dronons the \\"Inhuman\\" is infecting everyone.<br /><br />The races of people they meet, how they survive and how they deal with the Inhuman packs alot of adventure and excitement as well as some issues of humanity and morality.  A wonderful tale -- but now what happens to Maggie as Golden Queen and Gallen as her Lord Escort???	2005-06-15

First of all if you haven't read the previous 4 books in these two trilogies, read them first!!  While Haydon does include some background, believe me, it is not enough to enjoy this book.  This book is considerably shorter than the last and many in the 1st set of 3 as well.<br /><br />We have Rhapsody and Ashe at Navarrne and Gwydion, the son of the late Stephen Navarrne, coming of age.  Anborn, Ashe's uncle, is always good for both humor and wisdom.  Rhapsody is well into her pregnancy by human standards, but since she is Lirin as well and Ashe is wyrmkin, she has been suffering through this pregnancy with nausea and extreme tiredness.  Now she is back to having nightmares about dragons as well.<br /><br />Talquist in Sorbold, who is \\"regent\\" until he proclaims himself emperor, is so evil it is very scary!!  Destroying what is called Living Stone for his own evil purposes.  I won't say what here but his creation this time goes awry and I feel this part of the plot has some good things along with the evil happen.<br /><br />Back in Ylorc with Achmed and Grunthor, we have the Guild plotting since their leader was killed in Ylorc, Achmed intent on rebuilding the Light Catcher and the Earth Child withering.  None of this is good!!<br /><br />Finally, the explosion at the end of the last story has \\"awoken\\" a dragon.  Not just any dragon but Anwyn who is grandmother to Ashe, mother to the now elemental dragon and former Invoker Llauron who is Ashe's father.  Fortunately or unfortunately, Anwyn suffers from amnesia and only has a few images in her mind.  Unfortunately one of them is of Rhapsody so she sets out on a quest to find her.  She is aided by her sister Manwyn which is a very entertaining scene.<br /><br />Another part of the story I like was following Gwydion and Anborn and their adventures.  We learn alot more about both of them and their characters.  I also enjoyed Rhapsody going to Elynsynos lair to get help and ease during her pregnancy.<br /><br />The moreemphasis on the dragons in this book is very enjoyable and interesting.  Only a few plot lines are actually closed so alot is left for the final book.  I look forward to it!!	2005-06-11

If you don't enjoy James Patterson books such as this series on Lindsay Boxer and the Women's Murder Club or the Alex Cross books, don't read any farther!!  However, I happen to enjoy all of his books for what they are:  really exciting stories.<br /><br />This is the 4th book in this series and the first three were very rough especially numbers one (1st to Die) and three (3rd Degree) as some people very, very close to Lindsay and her friends were murdered.  I think this has left her a lot more vulnerable now in this fourth book than she was in the very first book.<br /><br />The book starts with a couple grisly murders in a sleazy motel room with \\"No one Cares\\" scrawled on the wall.  Lindsay and Jacobi, her former partner, have almost no leads but someone does spot a black Mercedes and gets a partial plate.  A few more clues and Jacobi comes by the restaurant where Lindsay, Claire and Cindy are having dinner and drinks and lets Lindsay know that they have spotted the Mercedes in a very bad part of town parked.  Lindsay goes with him to stake it out and her situation is all downhill from there.  Lindsay ends up as a defendant in a civil suit in what was clearly a self-defense shooting but yet it gets twisted around.  This part to me was very real and what happens frequently in the news right now!!<br /><br />Lindsay is convinced by her sister Cat and her lawyers to go \\"chill\\" on \\"vacation\\" at Cat's home in Half Moon Bay.  Lindsay decides to do this although she just hates being inactive!!  I can relate to that.  Half Moon Bay is very near where Lindsay's very first homicide case - still unsolved - took place.  Right away Lindsay meets and makes friends with people.  She is a bit naïve although mostly still thinking like a cop when she makes friends.  I think she feels \\"safe\\" as she has visited her sister there before.<br /><br />Half Moon Bay, however, has problems of its own.  Specifically some very grisly unsolved murders.  These murders remind Lindsay of her first case and soon she is working with local cops.  Meanwhile, she has to go back to San Francisco for the civil trial.  This is basically a showpiece for the plaintiff's hot shot lawyer.  I love how Lindsay's thinking one thing but doing another here as she manages to hold onto her temper!!  I don't know if I could under those circumstances.<br /><br />Joe Molinari, Lindsay's \\"boyfriend\\", is also in-and-out of the story and my only complaint here is that he should be all the way in or all the way out.  I can't imagine a strong and independent woman like Lindsay not making some life decisions here - maybe she will in the next book!!<br /><br />Needless to say as Patterson's books usually do, there are a myriad of subtle clues and hints and amazing denouement at the end.<br /><br />I found it a thoroughly exciting read!	2005-06-08

This book continues the story of the 3 women who are currently living in Harper House:  Rosalind, Stella and Hayley.  Stella's story was told in Blue Dahlia along with the story of the ghost of Harper House known as the Harper Bride.  We learned in the last book her name is Amelia and that she can be very powerful for a ghost.  Rosalind (Roz) Harper's story and romance is told in \\"Black Rose\\" along with more encounters and information about Amelia.<br /><br />Roz has hired Dr. Mitchell Carnegie to investigate her family line and try to find out who and where Amelia the ghost fits into the picture.  The growing romance between Mitch and Roz is wonderfully done.  Roz is 47 so she is at a stage where women can doubt their attraction and sexuality so even though she is extremely independent and confident in most things and at her business, In the Garden, a wonderful nursery on the Harper land, the way Mitch treats her is just incredible.  He is both tender and considerate but at the same time respectful of her independence.  He is romantic as well and ready to defend her in any way.<br /><br />The side stories of the ghost, Amelia, and Roz's ex-husband Bryce Clerk keep the action, suspense and mystery very high.  Also Mitch's son Josh and Roz's son Harper also add to the mix.<br /><br />As a more \\"mature\\" woman myself, I really enjoyed reading this very touching love story just as much as I did the side stories!!<br /><br />A wonderful read and I can hardly wait for the conclusion, \\"Red Lily\\" in December!!<br /><br />I can't wait	2005-06-03

The heroine, as indeed she is, is Vicky Allegretti, an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who has also been a D.A. in the plot's location of Philadelphia.  Vicki is a veritable dynamo when going after what she wants.  In this case, the tale opens with Vicki and her ATF agent partner, Morty, coming into an apartment building to interview a Confidential Informant for a case about a woman caught reselling guns.  Before they can meet with the CI, they hear shots fired, a young teenager comes down the stairs, and more shots are fired killing Morty.  Vicki is also threatened by the gunman but the young teenager tells the shooter that she is a \\"cop\\" and to hurry and leave.  The informant, a young black woman who was 8 months pregnant, is also found brutally murdered.<br /><br />Vicki feels that her office and police are not doing enough so she starts doing her own police work including re-interviewing the young woman accused of re-selling guns, Reheema Bristow.  Vicki is suspended for a week as she gets too angry with Reheema during the interview and thus begins some free time for Vicki - maybe too much time to think and analyze the case.<br /><br />Vicki starts down a trail beginning with interviewing Reheema's mother, watching and taking notes about drug trafficking in the neighborhood, Devil's Corner, and ending up pairing up with Reheema who is released with charges dropped.  Vicki's persistence in spite of pressure from her boss, his boss and her boyfriend and in spite of very serious danger makes for some very exciting chases and scenes.<br /><br />Vicki has amazing and sometimes frightening perseverance and drive.  She is also great at analyzing and coming to the correct conclusions and bringing in law enforcement when needed.<br /><br />This thriller was very hard to put down as you never knew what might happen next and with the side story of Vicki's best friend/boyfriend Dan Malloy as well to add some romance it made the whole book a great read!!<br /><br />Very highly recommended!	2005-06-02

This book has great primary characters in Jake Dilessio, homicide detective, and Ashley Montague, police academy student, and some very, very suspicious acting secondary characters.  The prologue is about what happened to Jake's partner 5 years ago but it keeps the suspense and mystery and we don't know any names!!<br /><br />Ashley and her two friends, Jan and Karen, take off for Orlando for the weekend and on the way pass a very strange auto/pedestrian accident.  The pedestrian is dressed in white briefs only.  Ashley who is very observant due both to her rookie status and artistic abilities, notes a figure in black across the road.  That weekend and when she gets back Ashley tries to find out more about the accident and discovers to her dismay that the pedestrian is Stuart, an old high school friend of hers.  He is in a coma and not expected to recover.  Ashley and Stuart's parents cannot believe he would take all the drugs found in his system.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jake is called to a scene at a canal where a young woman's badly decomposed body is found.  Some of the MO is the same as a serial killer who killed some women 5 years ago but the serial killer is supposedly dead of suicide or if it is the charismatic former preacher \\"Papa Pierre\\", he has been in prison the last 5 years for some financial crimes.  Jake is determined to find the killer from now and 5 years ago as he believes the same killer murdered his partner Nancy.<br /><br />As Jake and Ashley meet, argue, fight and learn to work together and trust each other lust and romance explode.<br /><br />The plots twists and turns and surprises are great!!<br /><br />A hard-to-put-down read!!	2005-06-01

I love reading Nora Roberts' magical series.  Most of them concern people from Ireland.  I have been to England several times but not Ireland -- but I hope to go there soon!!  This is the first book in a wonderful trilogy of the Gallaghers, 2 brothers and a sister.<br /><br />Jude has come to Ardmore to take a six-month break from being a psychology professor at a university and having a breakup with her fiancee.  She is not totally sure what she wants to do with her life but knows that what she has been doing leaves her unhappy and dissatisfied.  Aided and abetted by her grandmother who is from Ireland, she comes to stay at Maude Fitzgerald's Faerie Hill Cottage that was left to her grandmother who was Maude's cousin.  When she finally find the cottage after driving at night in the rain on the \\"wrong\\" side of the road, she sees a beautiful lady with pale hair and green eyes in an upstairs window.  Little does she know then that this is the Lady Gwen, a ghost, who waits for the time she can re-unite with her lover, Prince Carrick, a Faerie prince.<br /><br />Jude is befriended right away by Brenna O'Toole, a lovable redhead and tomboy-type, who does construction and home repairs.  She also meets Aidan Gallagher, the oldest son, who owens Gallagher's Pub in Ardmore.<br /><br />The story is about Jude finding herself and admitting her dreams and actually putting herself at rish to accomplish her dream.  That is a very tough thing for anyone and especially for Jude as her parents are university professors and leave in the world of academia which is very, very different than the magical and mystical world Jude encouters in Ardmore.  The other two lines of the story are about her romance with Aidan and the continuing story throughout the trilogy of the Lady Gwen/Prince Carrick relationship.<br /><br />I loved this story and have read the other two and enjoy the entire trilogy.<br /><br />Lots of fun if you like very romantic and mystical stories.	2005-05-27

She is a fine writer that combines romance, suspense and some fun.  This is the story of the oldest and more cautious in relationships Sinclair sister, Hope.  Hope is a Midday News reporter in Manhattan and has been on the warpath since Hartley House, a retirement apartment building, was unjustly condemned.  The story opens with the police in Hope's apartment as a neighbor called them.  Her apartment has been trashed!!  Searched, furniture destroyed, etc.  Hope's best friend, Jackie, comes to help her put it to rights.  Hope knows she is on the right trail.  However, her boss pulls her off the story and sends her on a magazine assignment to the Carribean island, Pleasure Island.  There an expedition is trying to find a lost Spanish galleon.  The main partners, Brad Talbot, a rich tycoon, and Conner Reese, an ex-SEAL, are working with an archaeology professor to try to determine where the ship went down.  Reese is in charge of operations and security and is quite angry when Hope arrives.  Publicity is the last thing he wants as he knows tourists and every Tom, Dick & Harry will surround the search area and make it nearly impossible and certainly highly unlikely that the finds and archeological objects will be preserved.<br /><br />Trouble ensues right off the bat and while Conner and Hope fight and give in to their mutual physical attraction, the danger to Hope grows.  For me, finding out the connection between the stories and characters and the way Hope persists until OTHERS are in danger was a joy to read.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me in the book was Hope's inability to make the final commitment!!  She is definitely more indecisive than her sisters and let past issues interfere a little too much.<br /><br />Altogether an enjoyable and suspenseful read!!	2005-05-17

This book is really a continuation to \\"Blind Alley\\" as the Cira legend is back.  Eve Duncan's ward, Jane MacGuire, is now at Harvard and is 21 so 4 years have passed since the last book.  She is close to Mike who is a ward of Eve's mom.  Jane is always helping people out of scrapes and feels particularly responsible for Mike.  His roommate calls her that Mike is drunk and morose at a bar.  Jane goes to get him and take him home but on the way to the car they are attacked and Mike is shot and killed.<br /><br />It turns out the kidnappers were really after Jane and Mike was just in the way.  Mark Trevor, from \\"Blind Alley\\", has been keeping an eye on Jane due to the search for Cira's gold.  He decides to \\"rescue\\" her and persuades her to come with him to Scotland where he has a translator working to discover where Cira's gold is.<br /><br />Lots of secondary characters are introduced including the laird of the castle, MacDuff, his ward, Jock who is a very disturbed young man, and Mario Donato, the translator.  Back from the last book also is Barlett who is a very loyal and funny character.<br /><br />While we do know the villain(s) in this book early on, the possible tragedies setup and the dicey situations keep the suspense going.  Also, the bit of mysticism with Jane's strange and realistic dreams of Cira also keep the story very interesting.  We get to know Jane and Trevor quite a bit better although I would still like to know them more.<br /><br />Eve and Joe have only minor parts while some of the secondary characters are developed pretty well and play major roles.  If you liked \\"Blind Alley\\", you will probably like this book.  If you didn't like it or don't like any \\"mysticism\\", this will not be a good plot for you.<br /><br />I loved it and recommend it!!	2005-05-17

I recently re-read this book after I had read \\"Murder List\\" about Alec Buchanan and then had to find my copy of \\"Mercy\\" about Theo Buchanan!!  When you put these books together, they amount to some real thrills and chills plus some comic relief.<br /><br />In this story, Nick, an FBI agent overdue for vacation, is called by his best friend, Tommy Madden who is a Catholic priest.  A crazy killer has confessed to a killing he did and a killing he WILL do -- murder Tommy's \\"little\\" sister Laurant.  Nick travels to Holy Oaks, Iowa which is a very small town to protect Laurant and also brings along Noah Clayborne to protect Tommy.  Other FBI agents come in to search Laurant's home as the killer, the Heartbreaker as he calls himself, has said he watches her sleep and knows every facet of her body.  This just gave me the creeps!!  Nick meets up with Laurant in Kansas City where she had driven to see how her brother's cancer treatment was coming.  They pose as a couple in love and arrive at her home in Holy Oaks where the two elderly sisters next door think Nick is there to investigate the death of their beloved dog.  They had written the  FBI because they believed he was poisoned.  Nick soon agrees and this adds a further sinister element!!  The agents searching Laurant's house find a video camera pointed at her bed.  Nick and Laurant and Noah use a storm as an excuse to disable it.<br /><br />There is a whole cast of secondary characters who are both helpful (Laurant's friend who is getting married, the old ladies, Noah) and highly suspicious such as the sheriff and a small-town real estate \\"magnate\\" who puts out the word that he is marrying Laurant.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much and the plot twists and final denouement had me fooled!!  I love not guessing the end!<br /><br />A fun read!!	2005-05-11

I have read most of the Stephanie Plum books and some of Janet Evanovich's other collaborative efforts.  I think the Stephanie Plum series is a lot of fun.  It is not a hard core mystery or suspense or even romance.  It is light-hearted, some silly potty humor, some sexual FUN (jokes, innuendo, etc.) and lots of very weird but sometimes true-to-life characters.  I could match a few people I know with Stephanie's sister Valerie (huh, that's my name too!) and her dad!<br /><br />Ranger is the mysterious man of very few words.  I think Ranger and Joe Morelli really love Stephanie and are both exasperated by her, sometimes frightened for her, but at the same time almost anticipate what trouble she might get into next.<br /><br />This story has Stephanie and her sometimes-partner Lulu stopping at a convenience store that is being robbed by the \\"Red Devil\\" who is called that due to his manner of dress and because he firebombs the store upon leaving.  Lulu and Stephanie hear the robbery going on so Lulu grabs her gun and accidentally shoots out the tires of the Red Devil's bike.  He comes out of the store and throws in the fire bomb, sees his bike and starts coming after Lulu and Stephanie, the store owner comes out with the fire bomb in his hand and lobs it at the Red Devil so what does it do?  Remember Stephanie's luck with cars?<br /><br />Lots of menace and mayhem ensue as Lulu and Stephanie try to track the Red Devil, apprehend some bondees, get ready for Valerie's wedding and \\"borrow\\" Ranger's truck.<br /><br />Are most of the situations improbable to impossible to believe?  Sure but for me that is what a FICTION NOVEL is for -- to have fun with scenarios that would NEVER come up in real life.<br /><br />If you just want some comic relief or craziness, you will have fun with this book.  If you want serious plots, etc., don't bother!	2005-05-06

I love reading book by Iris Johansen, Kay Hooper and others who deal in the psychic/telepathic/paranormal world.  Sometimes when I read I like to be in a fantasy world to have more fun and entertainment.  This book has it all.<br /><br />It starts with a prologue of Kerry Murphy as a child.  Her home is on fire with just her and her mother in it.  Her mother grabs her and helps her escape telling her to \\"GO!\\" when she hesitates as her mom falls down.  She runs across the street looking for help and sees a man who hits her on the head and she is then in a coma for sometime.<br /><br />To me the mystery of who that man is became an underlying story that does have significance in the end.  Kerry feels guilt for surviving the fire and becomes a firefighter but that is too tough on her.  When she awoke from the coma, she had a special ability to sense fires, people who are in them or who started them.  She uses this ability as an arson investigator using a Labrador retriever she picked up at the dog pound.  The dog, Sam, is basically a klutz and provides wonderful warmth and humor in the story.<br /><br />The main plot revolves around a project called Firestore that was created in a black ops-type of lab and was stolen by one of its inventors, James Trask.  Trask is angry that the project was shut down and starts killing off the scientists and government people responsible.  One of those is the elder half brother of Brad Silver, himself a pschic type called a controller.  Silver wants to find Trask and so does the President (President Andreas from previous Johansen books) so Silver sets out to get Kerry's help.<br /><br />Michael Travis, also from a previous Johansen book, is also brought into the story as the link between Silver and Kerry.  Silver links with Kerry without her knowledge and helps bring her out of a terrifying vision of a firefighter friend of hers being caught in a backdraft.<br /><br />Thus begins a strange but exciting relationship and quest to find James Trask.  There are alot more bumps in this romance than most and Kerry has some problems with trusting people but I thought that Ms. Johansen resolved all the issues very well with lots of surprises and tragedies.	2005-05-05

Lily is a much scarier female protagonist that many in other of Ms. Howard's books.  She is a hired contract killer - mostly hired by the CIA.  Without giving away the plot, which I hate when reviewers tell almost the whole story, Lily is going to meet her match in Lucas Swain who is even trickier than she is.  Swain is more tender-hearted and feels that Lily has lost out on a lot of life.  However, he was sent to take her out of the game and so falling for her is not a good plan.<br /><br />How Swain and Lily wrestle with their personal lives and relationship and how the mystery they are solving unfolds and is resolved provides close calls, ingenuity and many plots twists that for me make this a very fun read!!	2005-04-28

I enjoyed this book very much and looks forward to the next one coming out soon.  This book has disappointed some people and I can see why -- it is slower-paced and less \\"zesty\\" or \\"sparkly\\" as most of NR's books are.  I believe that is due more because of the situation for Stella in this book.  A young mother in the prologue whose young husband dies tragically in a commuter plane accident.  Her life has been so abruptly sent in another direction that I believe that NR's sympathies are with her and her boys and that she is thus approaching this on a softer and quieter level that may be somewhat boring for some readers.  I am a mom of 6 and loved this new side of Nora.<br /><br />I enjoyed the interaction of the three women, Roz, Stella and Hayley, the gruff by warm-hearted characterization of Logan and the start of the characterizations of Roz's oldest son, Harper, and the college professor, Mitch.<br /><br />The ghost and the accompanying mystery to the characters (but not to the readers so much) is sure to be a continual denouement that I look forward to reading.<br /><br />If you enjoy and gentle story, I recommend this!	2005-04-27

Navy SEAL Chief Cosmo Richter's mom breaks both her wrists so he is forced take leave to help arrange her care.  Cosmo hates being inactive so when his former boss, Tom Paoletti of Troubleshooters, Inc., a security firm, asks for his help as a bodyguard, he is glad of the chance.  This job is supposed to an easy one -- a young Hollywood producer, J. Mercedes (Jane) Chadwick has been receiving death threats while she is producing a new movie she wrote based on a true story about Hal Lord and Jack Shelton in WWII.  Jack Shelton is an advisor on the film and is gay.  The movie, American Hero, deals with his actions, meeting of Hal Lord, who is WAY in the closet, and their final parting.  J. Mercedes Chadwick is a very independent young woman with her own agenda and dual personalities of Mercedes, the party girl, and Jane, the serious, loving and intelligent producer.<br /><br />Robin Chadwick, Jane's half brother, plays Hal Lord.  Robin is basically a low-life, womanizing and hard drinking scum who occasionally shows glimmers of concern.  Back on the scene from Ms. Brockmann's other SEAL books is also Jules Cassidy, FBI agent and also gay.  His ex-lover, Adam, will become a co-star with Robin playing the Jack Shelton role.<br /><br />This book is really two main stories plus the third story within the movie, American Hero, also played out.  There is the story of the death threats from the extremist group/person against Jane and her movie, the story of Robin Chadwick, Jules Cassidy and Adam and finally the Hal Lord and Jack Shelton story.  Unlike her previous SEAL books, I think as her preface says that Ms. Brockmann has a definite agenda here but I think it is done well whether you agree or not with what her agenda is.  The mishaps and shootings are well done with plenty of excitement and tragedy.<br /><br />A good read!	2005-04-20

I have read most every book by Anne McCaffrey that is out there including the Pern books and Acorna books.  I have enjoyed the Talent series the most for the creativity of the author and the reality checks that are included.  I admit it would have been nice to have a perfectly completed and everything resolved type of ending but for me, I enjoyed that while the major issues of how to get the Hivers to not go out and destroy worlds populated with sentient beings and getting the Gwyn-Raven-Lyon grandchildren out on their own and starting their own dynasty are resolved more quietly than with a big bang!<br /><br />Especially touching and interesting in this book was the more information we got on Mrdinis, their hibernation and reproductive habits as well as their attitudes and politics.  The relationships between Asia and Rojer and Laria and Dano were also very nicely matured.<br /><br />I enjoyed learning more about the \\"bad guys\\" -- the Hivers -- their habitat was so well described I could just picture it.  I also swear that I have had a \\"sting-pzzt\\" type of experience -- when my husband used to work in a factory before we were married and came home with a sort of metallic powder all over him.  It was definitely a smell/taste/feeling!!<br /><br />I was also glad that this book had a few less tragedies since the last book had quite a few.  The invasion of the Blundell building was exciting and showed how Jeff Raven and the Rowan have still \\"got it.\\"	2005-04-16

Although there are actually about 3 \\"prequels\\" to this book including \\"To Ride Pegasus\\", \\"Pegasus in Flight\\" and \\"Pegasus in Space\\", the prequels are several generations before \\"The Rowan\\" but do give a nice background/foundation.  I highly recommend reading the prequels as they are a nice series in and of themselves.<br /><br />The Rowan is orphaned at 3 years old on Altair during a horrible mudslide which wipes out her family and an entire mining camp except her.  She is heard and rescued because she is a very strong \\"Talent\\" -- a person with strong psi skills and in this case, telepathing (as well as telekinesis and teleport as shown later in the book).  Her mental crying and shouting is heard throughout the planet by even minor Talents.  The Prime, Siglen, on Altair has an inner ear condition which makes her violently ill when trying to travel in space.  Siglen has inhibited all of the Primes (a T-1 or strongest of the Talents) she has trained so far and when they propose to send the Rowan to Earth for training she scares her as does the Rowan's past experiences.  Thus Siglen and a host of other nurse/psychologists/engineers train the Rowan until she is ready for a Tower of her own.<br /><br />She lands a post on Callisto, a moon of Jupiter, where there is a domed environment.  The Rowan being very temperamental takes a few years to get her staff together finally setting on Afra of Capella for her T-3 assistant.  She is contacted by a untrained Prime on the far out colony world of Deneb which is being invaded first by bio-warfare and then missiles by ruthless aliens.  Even though she hasn't met this new Prime, she is drawn to him by his sense of humor and voice and charm.  Jeff Raven, the new Prime, is not inhibited and can easily 'port himself to Callisto so they finally meet.  The Rowan finally overcomes her fears when Jeff is very critically wounded by shrapnel from a leftover missile that landed on Deneb.<br /><br />I like the love story and actually found it believable -- but maybe I am naive.  As a mom of 6, I also loved the feelings expressed by the Rowan for her impending motherhood and the beginning of her maturity and her nurturing nature and love of family.<br /><br />I recommend reading this and the books that follow!!	2005-04-12

She reads a 12-page prologue from her shelf of unsolicited manuscripts and it intrigues her greatly.  The rest of the story follows both the author of the prologue and the real people surrounding Maris and the unveiling of one person close to her's true character.<br /><br />I enjoyed the interplay and dialogues with Maris and her father, Daniel Matherly, who is well-developed as a secondary character.  I also enjoyed finding another secondary character who is NOT as nasty/evil as first thought.

As in most of Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series you know who the major villain is right at the start of the book.  That fact in no way detracts from the suspense, mystery and intrigue in this story!!  Clara is a very complex and well-developed character who turns out not only to be very diabolical but also even sympathetic in that you as the reader feel sorry for her horrific childhood and how after doing so much evil she tries to start a normal life only to have it viciously interrupted.<br /><br />Clara stays a step ahead of the FBI and even Alec and his band of cohorts by adapting to circumstances.  The development of some of the secondary characters is very well done.  Not enough time maybe spent on Weather considering that Alec and she are getting married and expecting a baby together but that is okay since the main point of these books, in my opinion, is the villain and how Alec finally comes up with a way to trap/catch/catch up with them.<br /><br />A great read and hard to put down!!	2005-03-31

I like this one alot as it has the characters including the villain make mistakes -- more like real life!!  Although we know who the murderer is right from the start it is very interesting to read his development, meet his mother and try to figure how his mind works.<br /><br />Lucas and Weather's relationship is developing and re-gluing which is an emotional sidebar that adds to Davenport's character and development.  Also, I like the different types of working relationships he has with his peers, boss, the media, etc.  All serve to round out his character even more in this book.<br /><br />Some surprises and some suspense and some romance -- if you like that kind of read you will enjoy this book.	2005-03-27
US	35733349	R15VAGUPM0O5XC	0345453824	572584022	Murder List	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Neither the best nor the worst.	I enjoy reading Julie Garwood and enjoyed this book in spite of the  lack of true mystery in one sense of the word.  The reader knows who the sociopath is from the beginning.  Regan and Alec make a good pair and the setup of her as a \\"crybaby\\" through the telling of Regan and her best friends, Cordie and Sophia, meeting in kindergarten to deal with a bully.  I too had that nickname in elementary school and I think throwing up on a bully would have been a great thinig to have happened!!  Her brothers though teens then did give her pretty good advice.<br /><br />The trouble is that once she is an adult -- a rather naïve one at that -- her brothers are still trying to control her.  When she is with her friends, Regan seems the most believable.  I do not think she is a wimp, however, but gets her way through more subtle means.<br /><br />The Murder List is a great idea and I don't want to spoil how that all comes about.  The self-styled guru, Dr. Shields, is also a common type and I loved seeing what happens to him.<br /><br />A fun but light read!	2005-03-24

I have read a couple of Karen Robards books before and was anxious to read this one.  I did not regret it!!  She has an independent and feisty heroine in Madeline (Maddie) Fitzgerald, a determined and sexy hero in Sam McCabe and lots of fun secondary characters such as E.P. Wynee, Sam's partner; Cynthia Gardner, also on Sam's team and Jon and Susan.  The dog, Zelda, is also a riot.<br /><br />McCabe is an FBI special agent tracking a serial killer who calls him to leave clues.  Maddie is the proud owner of a small advertising agency that is due to make a presentation the next morning at a dog food manufacturing company in New Orleans.  Maddie is attacked and nearly killed in her hotel room.  The killer also kills another Madeline Fitzgerald who is staying at the same hotel that same night/early morning.  Maddie has secrets in her past that make her distrust law enforcement in general and the FBI in particular so lots of fireworks when McCabe & Wynne track her down to question her.  Maddie & Jon make their presentation and win business with the dog food company by suggesting the owner's dog to appear in the ads and on a new logo.<br /><br />Maddie & Jon fly back to St. Louis but Maddie is afraid her past is catching up with her.  In the meantime, McCabe is convinced the killer will go after her again as she is the one who got away.  Lots of close calls, comic relief from Zelda (the dog) and Wynne, romance and plots twists follow.<br /><br />A delightful and thrilling read if you like mystery, thrills and some humor!	2005-03-21

I am now looking for some of her older Irene Kelly stories and newer ones than \\"Flight\\".  I thought this story was great from start to finish.<br /><br />The development of Detective Philip Lefebvre was very good for the few chapters allowed.  It made me like him and feel for him.  The startling murder on the yacht with the setup of brother/sister conversation/squabbling made the violence all that more intense.  When Det. Lefebvre finds Seth Randolph who is clinging by a thread to life it is heart-stopping.  I won't give away all the elements but suffice to say when we come back to Las Piernas ten years later, it is very shocking to find Lefebre suspected for murdering Seth who was a witness.  Frank Harriman is also a well-developed character.  I could see his frustration as he tried to deal with the cops who had been around 10 years ago and formed their own prejudicial opinions.  Lots of twists and lots of surprises!!<br /><br />A great read!	2005-03-17
US	35733349	R2I8PIGWZAOYS7	0743406079	927922032	Freefall	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A real fun thriller!!	If you liked \\"Icefire\\" or \\"Quicksilver\\" or enjoy novels by Tom Clancy or David Baldacci, you might enjoy this book.  While the book is kind of a sequel to \\"Icefire\\" it also stands on its own quite well without needing the information about the main characters, Mitch Webber, Cory Rey, Wilhemina Bailey and her husband, to \\"fill-in.\\"<br /><br />The story starts with a prologue into the past where we meet Major Bailey's dad and the main story begins with Captain Webber on another SEAL type mission switching off with the situation on the ISS Space Station where Dr. Rey is retrieving samples.  The disasters that happen and the many interactions and development of secondary characters such as Varik, Gen. Salyard all contribute to a thrilling ride to the final conclusion.  Sometimes the reader needs to really think to discover which is the \\"good\\" side and which is the \\"bad\\" and if it really is that clear.<br /><br />I loved especially the details of being on a space station, rescue efforts, things that go wrong, etc.  If all felt very real and I attribute that to the Reeves-Stevens team's research!!<br /><br />I look forward to more books by this great writing team!	2005-03-15

While I do love some of JAK's other books such as \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" that are mysteries and suspense, I get the most fun out of the Harmony and lost colony books.  Anyone remember \\"Shield's Lady\\"?  I also loved the Amaryllis, Zinnia, Orchid books.  One thing about this book is that you REALLY need to have read \\"After Dark\\" first so you know more about this world and what \\"ghost hunters\\" and \\"trap tanglers\\" are.<br /><br />I hope that JAK continues to write as Jayne Castle and doesn't make us devoted Castle fans wait so long for a new lost colony romance!<br /><br />A very fun read!!	2005-03-08

These last two stories of the 4 Calhoun sisters and their sister-in-law were very touching as both women, Suzanna and Megan, were single moms.  Suzanna through divorce and Megan as a never married and left-in-the-lurch innocent.  Suzanna particulary had a rough time trusting herself and her feelings after a very rough marriage and had so much concern for her sons that as a mom myself I could empathize.  Megan was so young when she trusted innocently (here is another reason that abstinence before marriage is not a bad idea) and was so hurt and ignored by the father of her child.<br /><br />The secondary characters of Dutch and Aunt Coco were lots of fun and you could feel how Dutch was nervous about the whole thing but couldn't fight it.  And then you add in the mystery of the emeralds and Bianca and Christian's relationship and that was very touching as well.<br /><br />I recommend it -- not as a heavy serious mystery but as a light, touchingly funny and sensitive set of stories.	2005-03-07

I only started reading Nora Roberts about 10 years ago and missed many of her romances as I read JD Robb books and some of her longer mystery/adventure novels.<br /><br />I find these first 3 stories of the Calhoun women to be of old-fashioned romance and a very enjoyable read.  Aunt Coco reminds me of my mom.  I also like the personalities of the sisters and how they are able to stand up for themselves but appear feminine and maybe even a little helpless.  Men do sometimes like to know they are needed, but we women know we have real backbone when we need it!  I also enjoy the ongoing hunt for the emeralds and wondering what the slimey thief is going to try to pull next!<br /><br />I look forward to the next one.	2005-03-04

I have read most of James Patterson's books including the latest Alex Cross \\"London Bridges\\".  This is one of his best and the co-author, Howard Roughan, an obviously good collaborator and writer as well.<br /><br />This mystery starring Nora Sinclair, a beautiful and deadly woman, has lots of twists and even if you think you guess the ending -- you won't.  I liked the John O'Hara character as he was developed enough to give you some clues as to his motivation and actions in the book.  John's dialogues with his boss, Susan, are also fun and seem typical for his character.<br /><br />Nora's strange personality and the little clues and mysteries to what and why these things are happening are fun for me to get into.  Some people may find the plot obvious but I enjoyed it very much!	2005-02-28

I have read Ms. Charen's columns in magazines and other publications and enjoyed them.  This is the first book by her that I have read.  If you are a Liberal and/or HAVEN'T read \\"Do-Gooders\\" and aren't interested in the FACTS -- not opinion, don't bother.  Don't even bother with this review.<br /><br />Ms Charen does not hesitate to skewer the people who need it from  conservatives to liberals.  She also doesn't hesitate to quote from such famous and liberal Democrats as Robert Kennedy who was not as liberal as the Democrats of today.  This is not a be-all or solve-all book.  It addresses specific issues such as racism, welfare, education, and marriage and shows the evolution of our values and ideas about these subjects and how they have changed and why.<br /><br />We can ALL learn from the facts in this book.  If you don't believe, just go look up a few of the many references that Ms. Charen gives in the book.  Don't like the facts?  Well, live in your own world.	2005-02-24

Dick Morris worked with the Clintons for over 20 years.  Yes he was a political consultant and worked for both sides of the fence, so to speak, but he did actually like the Clintons.  I feel it even comes out in this book as he tries to give Hillary Clinton some advice about the HILLARY brand name that she has created.<br /><br />I think he is dead-on in his analysis based on the events during the after the Clinton White House years.  From his position he obviously has some insights that WE, the general public, do not have.<br /><br />Sure politicians are still politicians and always trying skew what they say but Hillary (and Bill) have taken that \\"art\\" to a whole new level and it is clear in this book why some of their problems became so big and public and how they could have handled them better.

This is a VERY different kind of book if you are used to reading Nora Roberts series such as the Three Sisters Island trilogy, Donovan books, McGregor books or others -- even the JD Robb \\"In Death\\" books.  The occult and Satanism are scary subjects.  I really enjoyed this book as it showed insight into small town life,  and the faces we show and who we really are.<br /><br />The romance between Clare and Cameron is well done and the secondary characters are very interestingly developed especially Ernie Butts, her neighbor.  This book was originally written over 12 years ago but I think it still stands up very well.<br /><br />I loved the mystery and surprises as well!	2005-02-24

I enjoyed reading this book as I have 6 kids, 4 of whom have finished going through the public school system with 2 still in school and I see the things that they are being taught by a few of the teachers!  This book is correct in many, many areas.  I disagree with the author on a few of his conclusions but the majority of the book is great to read and really shows the lies -- yes LIES -- that are being taught in our schools and colleges right now.  I wish more teachers would be as good as the American History teacher my middle son had.  He was fair and balanced in presenting all points of view.  That makes more sense to me!<br /><br />As one example, I have children right now who know more about Martin Luther King than they do about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.  I would hope that they should know about ALL the important figures in history just as I would be disappointed if they ONLY knew about Washington and Lincoln and not King.  I also have children who don't have a clue about World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War let alone the Gulf War!!<br /><br />This book should be required reading for young adults who want to learn the other side of the issue whether they agree or not -- and admittedly some people will not!<br /><br />I enjoyed it very much.	2005-02-24

The people develop as characters, the romance and sex are just right and fun and the added mystery a bonus.<br /><br />I would love to see a spin off or sequel to the book as there were definitely some \\"Lunatics\\" that deserve their story being told.	2005-02-23

Chantel's story in \\"Skin Deep\\" is one that has been mimicked in real-life and we can relate to her frustration and fears.  The romance and character development are well done by Ms. Roberts as she makes Quinn a hero but with flaws to humanize him.

This is actually a re-issue of the first two books about the O'Hurley triplets and their brother.  Since I did not read the originals it was all new to me.  I read \\"O'Hurleys Return\\" first and had to go back and buy this one.  It was WELL worth it.  I loved Abby's story as I am a mom of 6 and often would wonder when the kids were young what I would do if something happened to my husband who used to travel quite frequently.  Abby shows amazing courage and drive.  She is goal oriented.  The book does not show her as a perfect mom which I also liked.  Without giving away the story I will say that I felt for her situation of trying to keep personal things private and protect her kids but at the same time  allowing her deceased husband's biographer to tell a more complete story.<br /><br />I also enjoyed so much the second story about Maddy and her life as a dancer, singer and actress in theatre in New York.  Her Bohemian life style and fun loving spirit were great and the romance written was very believable.  I enjoyed the development of Reed Valentine as well.<br /><br />The O'Hurleys are a fun family and maybe like her MacGregor series Ms. Roberts will considered a new generation to write about?	2005-02-21

I have read all of the books in Catherine Coulter's FBI series and really enjoy them.  They have everything I like for an entertaining read:  suspense, mystery, fun/comedy, romance!  I love it when Ms. Coulter brings back Savich and Sherlock and also has two new characters who will also get romantically involved.  \\"Blowout\\" is a good story on both plot lines, an older unsolved murder and the new present-day murder with a little other-worldliness thrown in.<br /><br />The story begins in the Poconos where FBI agent Dillon Savich is on his way back to the cabin where he, Sherlock and their son Sean are staying for a brief vacation.  He is on an icy and snowy road when his tire blows out.  After he calls Sherlock to let her know he is delayed and changes the tire, a young woman dressed in a light summer dress comes running out of the woods on the side of the road hysterically screaming that Savich needs to go with her and that someone is going to kill her.  Savich gets her in his car and under her direction drives to a nearby side road and down the road a bit to a beautiful mansion on a hill.  The lights are all on in the house and a cozy fire burning in the living room.  There doesn't appear to be anyone there but Savich takes no chances and has his gun out.  He searches downstairs but doesn't find anything or hear anything.  The woman is still terrified and crying while sitting on the couch.  They hear footesteps -- very loud -- above them.  Savich goes upstairs and still can't find anyone although he sees a young boy's room with a sports poster from 1972.  Then he hears a loud thump above and he find the attic and goes up the ladder when something whooshes out and knocks him off onto his back.  When he gets up and goes back downstairs, the woman is gone.  He calls Sherlock and they agree to meet at the Sheriff's office.  They ride back out to the house with the Sheriff who has been Sheriff over 30 years in the small town.  The Sheriff told them the place was deserted and the owners long moved out.  He speculates also and tells them of the young Mrs. Samantha Barrister who was murdered there in 1972.  All in all not very satisfying for Savich who cannot sleep well that night.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., at the Supreme Court Building, another mysterious murder is taking place that same Friday evening around midnight.  Supreme Court Justice Stewart Califano is garrotted while in the building's library.<br /><br />The next morning, Savich and Sherlock are called back from vacation to head the investigation so the mysterious woman or ghost? is put on hold.  They are glad to work again with their friend from the Metro Police, Det. Ben Raven.  None of them are happy that Justice Califano's stepdaughter, Callie Markham who is an investigative report, also insists on helping.<br /><br />To not be a spoiler, I will not say more on the plot except there are more murders and very scary times on the Justice murder investigation and Sherlock works to get information to ease Savich's mind and help resolve the mystery of the murdered Samantha Barrister and why she appeared to him. I think Ms. Coulter has a great imagination as she manages to find totally new villains, plot twists and situations for each of her FBI thrillers.  I look forward to reading the next one soon!  If you are NOT a Coulter fan, then this may be too light of reading for you!	2005-02-12

This book had a particular surprise and showed some growth in Eve's character.  When you figure how she and Roarke have only been married two years, which to me seems very short as I have been married 28 years, the development and understanding they are beginning to show towards each other is great.  I look forward to more books and for the birth of Mavis' child which will surely impact Eve more than anything.	2005-02-10
