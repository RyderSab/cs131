The book does give some general background material on the basic systems, like working with arrays, matrices, writing programs and other basic details.  Book also covers data transformation, linear models, generalized linear models, model diagnostics and graphing.   <br /> <br />Fox is a sociologist and the examples come from his line of work, however this does not degrade the books ability to show regression modelling using R or S.  Except for the specific examples the book plus the extra chapters available on the books website more or less covered what was covered in my graduate engineering regression class.   <br /> <br />Topics such as nonlinear, robust, resampling, time series, nonparametric, while not covered in the book, chapters are however provided on the books website and appear to the same quality as what is in the rest of the book.  Scripts for all the chapters, including the online-only chapters, are also available on the website.	2004-11-20

However I did find it odd when they would occassionally explain basic readily known notation, but later on assume the reader is familiar with what I would regard as advanced notation, or leave out quite a few steps in their mathematics assuming the reader understands what they did.  This book covers a wide range of techniques ranging from the more traditional to the current, and for each topic presents an overview of the technique and provides adequate references for further exploration.   <br /> <br />The reader should have a good underlying understanding of linear algebra, statistics and probability theory and also be familiar with the techniques presented here.  This book was used in a graduate engineering data mining class, and most of us struggled greatly with the book.  This book probably would have been more appropriate if this was a book to augment another text, or if this had not been the first time we had seen topics such as those presented, this being the book to explain neural networks, support vector machines and whatnot when you've never seen them before makes for a very bewildering experience, but once you find a few journal articles the techniques actually are fairly easy to understand. <br /> <br />The book does not explain how to implement using software any of the techniques, this is a topic left up to other books, such as Modern Applied Statistics with S by Ripley and Venerables, and only in their discussion about apriori for association rules did I see that they state a software package.  It would have been nice if they would have given some insight into how they created some of the great graphics that punctuate the book, perhaps as additional material on the website. <br /> <br />A book that is more down to earth for engineers, albeit different in scope, would be Duda and Hart's Pattern Classification, which I believe are electrical engineers and written more from an engineering standpoint.  In addition the Duda and Hard book gives a lot of applications-based problems and has an associated MATLAB handbook to walk readers through building many types of learners, while this book the end-of-chapter excercises are almost exclusively proofs and theoretical excercises.  Not a fault of the book, but rather just a difference and depends on what the reader wants to get out of it. <br /> <br />Ultimately, even though it did prove to be a rather confusing book, I have learned a lot from it and will continue to go through it to learn even more from it as it does tend to become more lucid the more I go through it.	2004-11-13

This book is written more at an engineering level, and I found it to bridge well between advanced texts such as Elements of Statistical Learning and more general audience books that really are lacking.  Duda and Hart do a good job at explaining the concepts, however some techniques only recieve a cursory overview while other topics are rather elaborated upon, however this may have been done by the authors experience of which techniques are commonly employed in practice.  The excercises at the end of the chapters include a lot of hands on programming and computer-based assignments which I found useful, and a MATLAB workbook associated with this is also offered, however I have not read this book.  Nonetheless I have implemented some of the concepts in this book using Matlab and it definately does help to cement the idea, even if this is just serves as an intellectual excercise and isn't intended to be used for anything else.  With a little bit of digging through the help or using a book such as Ripley and Venerable's Modern Applied Statistics with S, most if not all of the techniques can be explored using the R statistical software.	2004-11-13

The book also tries to teach the statistics to a degree, which one can see as an annoyance (just teach me R!) or helpful if you are shaky on your stats.  The book also lists a fair number of references to other books on S-plus and R to help point you in the direction towards achieving a higher level of adeptness and other references to learn more about the topics covered in the book. <br /> <br />The book also has exercises at the end of each chapter to get you into R and using the system.  The answers to the exercises are not in the book, but are available in pdf format on the books corresponding website.	2004-10-02

This book sets itself apart by emphasizing modeling strategies rather than teaching just theory or applied regression in the textbook fashion in which all the examples work out perfectly and one doesn't have to worry about dirty data.  Instead it talks exstensively about topics that occur in the real world, such as handling missing data, a big problem when dealing with real data but rarely mentioned in most regression texts.  He also talks about many of the traps students get themselves from what they learn in an intro regression class is not always exactly the best way of going about doing things and explains better alternatives. <br /> <br />Through out the book, use of S-plus and R is liberal which is very nice.  Numerous extensive case studies thoroughly analyze data sets using many of the techniques he describes and gives full S-plus/R code for them to recreate on your own.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I really didn't like the data sets he chose to analyze.  Many of them were medical related, another used Titanic survivors data, another was about the 2000 election, while very well done, I found the datasets themselves rather uninteresting.  This of course leads to a problem, me being an engineer, I'd rather have datasets I can relate to, while of course a social scientist would like sets they could relate to, so I realize the author has a hard time making everyone happy.  It would be nice to have prehaps had additional case studies available on the book website, perhaps worked by other individuals from a variety of disiplines.	2004-10-02

The first two chapters that talked a lot about differences in Western vs. Eastern thought and language structures were big eye openers.  There were a number of profound moments reading the book, such as when he noted contemplating what happens to us after death is like wondering what happens to your fist when you open you hand or what happens to your lap when you stand up.  The writing style of the book is highly approachable, I myself a graduate engineering student found it very readible, Watts doesn't try to blow the reader away with his academic prowess but rather keeps it simple and direct, like zen itself.	2004-10-01

A lot of the material that we used in our advanced level experimental design class comes from the extra material that is available for free of off the books supplemental website, and there is a great wealth of more advanced material in there that is worth printing off, and there is a lot of supplemental material. So if you feel solid on what is in the textbook, tackle the supplemental material to further delve into DOE topics. The book uses numerous examples using SAS, Minitab and Design-Expert and lots of enjoyable practice problems, so following along using any of the packages is pretty easy.	2004-08-13

The book and the excercises were interesting and highly informative, as are all of Dr. Montgomery's numerous texts.  Most concepts are backed up with liberal examples to help understand the theory and cement the concept and their practical applications, and run the whole gamut from management to electrical engineering problems.  Many of the tables in the back of the book, such as the random number table, are outdated due to computers, however these may have been dropped in the new version of the text.	2004-08-13

Of the two I greatly preferred the Barrons.  I felt the Kaplan questions, practice tests and overall quality of the material was inferior to Barrons.  However, one could do much worse than use the Kaplan's guide, as I went through quite a few of the GRE books that are available at the library and bookstore, and in comparison to many others, Kaplans appears to be decent.  Being in engineering, I stressed the math section and essay section and did not really take advantage of the verbal portions of the study guides, so I really cannot comment on if Barrons or Kaplans is better for that portion of the test.  For the math section, it felt weaker than the Barron's, and the questions and practice exams seemed easier.  For the essay, Kaplan's was ok with the sample essays, however a lot of example essays are also available through the downloadable sample test software off of the GRE website, and I thought those were better.	2004-08-13

Of the two, the Barrons guide was much much better in my opinion.  Math, verbal and the essay section were all more than adequately covered and gave me all the help I needed to really perform for the test and do great the first time.  I also looked through a number of other GRE guides at the bookstore and checked out a bunch from the library, but none of them I felt came close to the Barrons book.  Predominately due to the Barrons book, I got 700 math, 5.5 on the essays, and 450 on the verbal on my first try.  Why the low verbal?  Because I'm in engineering where verbal scores are not stressed and therefore I did not study for it very intensely at all, however I do feel that the Barrons book would more than adequately prepare someone that is taking the GRE for admission to grad school for a major that does take the verbal score in high consideration for acceptance.	2004-08-13

I've run into a few chemical engineers that have read only this book and have no idea what mixture experiments are, and why they are important in their DOE work.  Also, I do not remember seeing any material on split-plot designs, and this topic is very important in industrial experimentation since most experiments are split-plots whether you know it or not, and you cannot evaluate them as normal.  This is no fault of the book due to its publish date, but a newer book, such as Montgomery's or Hamada &amp; Wu should also be read through to learn about the more recent advancements in DOE.	2004-05-05

Is quite a bit different from most statistics books that I have encountered, however I think that difference is what makes it so effective, this book has been a big eye-opener in viewing everything as a process.  The book focuses on principals and the different tools that are available rather than focusing on drilling students with problems.  I figure the authors understand that these days computers and statistics software is widely available, so the mathematics behind the techniques is only lightly touched upon.  Book finishes up with some theory and a few useful appendixes that go more indepth into certain topics (such as surveying, probability distributions and process reengineering).  This is also the book that introduced me to the wonders and excitement of experimental design, which it does a nice job introducing you and preparing you for more advanced texts such as Montgomery's Design of Experiments text.	2003-05-11

The cards are rather small however, and one must be careful not to misplace/lose any of them since there are so many.

The two sample  projects that he walks you through I thought were excellent additions to  the book.  The author also gives you a brief background of the GNOME  project and how it is different from KDE which uses QT.<br />One thing I did  not like about this book was the fact he does not give any mention to GTK--  which is the C++ kit or any of the many other languages that can take  advantage of GTK beyond acknowledging it's existance.  It would have been  really nice for this book to have had a chapter on other languages and  GTK.<br />Also the chapter on the rapid application development (AKA RAD) tool  GLADE was rather skimpy.<br />However if you are a C programmer looking for a  good GTK book, look no further.	2000-06-22

I took programming in high school but the books we used were so boring and stale, I hated programming.<br />Now I pick up this book, wow, this  book makes programming fun!  The book is clear and has lots of examples and  he fully explains every line in the examples too.  He gives you a few  projects to do at the end of each chapter which are interesting and fun to  do.<br />Since I used to program in C++, I can honestly say  if someone asked  me what a good book would be to buy to start programming I would recommend  this one.  It starts from the beginning and works upward at a good pace.   <br />My C++ knowledge had obviously rusted completely over after four years,  however this book very quickly brought it back into focus.

This book does a much more exhaustive job of explaining how to build a linux firewall.<br />Going beyond just  telling you &quot;here's what you want your firewall script to look  like&quot; which is what I felt the other book did, this title explains why  you shouldn't have certain daemons running on the firewall, what ports to  block and the possible consequences and attack types that can come from not  blocking a specific port. Amusingly enough, it even tells you the port to  leave open if you plan on running a Quake server.<br />As pointed out below,  the wrap around on some of the examples is annoying.<br />The book also is  dedicated to handling the threat from the outside, it does not deal with  the internel threat that any company needs to guard against, though it is  pointed out in the very beginning that this book isn't designed to deal  with internal threats, so I don't see this as a negative.<br />I found the  book easy to read.  There are some technical books you dread picking up  since they are so stale, this fortunately I found not to be like  that.<br />The entire book is dedicated to firewalls.  Some firewall books I  have seen a good chunk of the book is choosing hardware and how to install  the OS.  The author of this book intelligently reasoned that his readers  already have Linux installed and want a book on firewalls, not a how to  install the OS.	2000-05-12

Professional Apache looked alot more complete and covered alot more than the O'reilly  title.  In fact this title seems to cover alot more than any other Apache  book I have looked through.<br />I have found the book as being quite easy to  read and understand.  It also does a really good job at fully explaining  the aspect of Apache that the book is talking about in that chapter.  As  for currency, the latest version of Apache is talks about is 1.3.9<br />I also  did not find the book to be stale, dry reading.  It was quite interesting.   The book read quite quickly.  I went from knowing very little about Apache  to feeling quite confident with it in only a couple of days.<br />All in all,  a very good book to have.	2000-05-12

What does it say on the cover!   Readiness *Review*!  Not Study  Guide.  When used as a Study Guide, I can totally see why people come up  short, because that's not what it is designed for.  People that use this  book as such are doing themselves little good getting certifications and  not being able to perform in the real world since they have no real  knowledge or experience.  When used appropriately as a review of questions  that are from Microsoft, same guys that make the real test, I find it very  much worth the money.  <br />Even if the questions were a little off from what  the real test has, fine with me, if I pass just goes to show that I really  know my stuff and just not reguritating(sorry if it's spellt wrong) stuff I  memorized in a few short days before writing a test.  I'm taking my Server  test in three days, and I for one am going to be able to show that I really  know Windows NT inside and out, like a real Microsoft Certified  Professional should.  Seperate yourself from the wannabes and learn your  stuff for real.<br />A+,Network+,MCP	2000-01-17

This book was great as a study tool and learning workstation more indepthly also.  I found the book to be well written, informative, and definately worth the money.
