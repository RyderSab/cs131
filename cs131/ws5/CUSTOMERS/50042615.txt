US	50042615	R7TGA9ZOMSYB7	068483197X	940902708	Death By Chocolate Cookies	Books	4	3	5	N	Y	Good Cookies	I am not a big fan of this author, but this book is a happy exception. His other books are OK resources for professionals and amateur pastry chefs, but worthless for the average, casual home cook.  This is the only one of Mr. Saulniers' books that I feel safe in recommending to a home cook. It is, in short, a collection of very good chocolate cookie recipes, both in flavor and in written recipe quality.<br /><br />In most cookbooks, cookie recipes are an afterthought with standard recipes casually tossed off in a few sentences. This book is entirely different: each cookie recipe has complete, detailed instructions for each step, including a color photo of the end result.  Even someone who has not baked many cookies should have no problems successfully making these cookies. For those who can do the cookie recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag, this book is the next step. I tried some seemingly incorrect recipes (recipes with no eggs, doughs that seemed to have the wrong balance, etc.), but they all came out as advertised, and I had no trouble with any of them, though I noted that some instructions were inadequate, e.g. cooking something in a saucepan for a certain number of minutes with no indication as to what end result you are looking for.  It is also the only cookbook I know of that lists the complete mise en place including all equipment, materials, and ingredients, something I wish more cookbooks would do.<br /><br />Only in the last chapter (\\"More Than a Mouthful\\") is the author up to his old tricks: professional techniques inadequately explained; here, home cooks should ignore it, but B&P people should pay close attention. I also note that some photos are cheats, in other words if you prepare the recipe exactly as written, yours will not exactly look like the picture.	2005-10-07
US	50042615	RVM3LU7634QD6	0688102298	748518137	CookWise: The Hows & Whys of Successful Cooking, The Secrets of Cooking Revealed	Books	3	40	59	N	N	Cook, but not very wise	This cookbook and its author are widely hailed (and often quoted) by other cookbook authors as being the cook's cook: the authoritative resource you go to when you are having difficulty with something culinary or have a very technical question.  After reading this book, one is inclined to believe that these claims are either exaggerated or just politeness.  Despite my reservations about the validity of many of the author's explanations, the recipes themselves are thoroughly tested and very reliable.  Also, if you have tried cooking from a couple of cookbooks but are having trouble getting them right, this book has unusually detailed recipe procedures and rather verbose ancillary material, greatly increasing your chances for success with a particular recipe, especially the more difficult ones.<br /><br />This cookbook sort of reminds me of a TV commercial I saw as a kid advertising a magic kit you could send away for, all at the low price of only $19.95: magic is easy, once you know the secret.  I sometimes feel the same way about cooking: once you figure it out, you really do not need cookbooks.  Here, however, the cookbook author does a lousy job of revealing the \\"secret\\".<br /><br />The section on bread baking was not particularly error-free. I appreciate the author's chatty and verbose style, but her bread chapter was no more reliable or illuminating than a standard, mass-merchandise paperback cookbook.<br /><br />1) It calls for inventory you may not necessarily have: malt syrup, instant potato flakes, 1/4 of a 500 mg vitamin C tablet, and a 12 x 4 loaf pan.<br /><br />2) The author rightfully focuses attention on the variability of flour between different brands and even between different areas (the same bag flour will be different depending on what part of the country you are in), yet never reveals what brand she used in developing her bread recipes.<br /><br />3) She admits the fallibility of specifying flour in volume rather than weight and further specifies that a cup of flour in her recipes correspond to 5.6 oz., yet she insists on specifying only volume measure for flour in her recipes.<br /><br />4) The recipes also do not have exact descriptions on when a loaf of dough is properly proofed: she merely uses the standard \\"until doubled\\" statement; OK, you have an oblong clump of dough proofing on a sheet pan, and you are suppose to judge when it is \\"doubled\\" how? With a ruler?<br /><br />5) Her described method of simply pushing dough back and forth to knead it by hand appears to be incomplete.  All kneading instructions are given for a stand mixer, and one is inclined to believe that she does not knead bread dough by hand on a regular basis.<br /><br />6) the instructions for kneading dough never describes how to tell when the dough is kneaded enough. She tells how many minutes on a stand mixer it takes, yet never reveals the brand of mixer she uses nor the exact speed number she uses.<br /><br />7) She flatly states that salt enhances \\"better gluten development\\" and that spices \\"enhance yeast activity\\"; both claims are dubious and she presents no evidence that she tested these claims.  She is merely quoting a magazine article, but clearly has not tested the claims to see if it really does what the food chemist has researched.<br /><br />8) She also flatly states that bread is cooked when the internal temperature is 200 degrees (perhaps we should compliment her on at least mentioning internal temp as a test for bread doneness?); this is also wrong. Many rich, egg yolk and sugar laden breads are done at 190, and many lean doughs like french baguettes and sourdough, are not totally done until 210 degrees or beyond.<br /><br />9) She often does not specify how to tell when a loaf is done baking, but only specifies a time range or just mentioning the standard and inexact method that the loaf will sound hollow when thumped on the bottom (hint: even under-baked loaves will \\"sound hollow when thumped on the bottom\\").<br /><br />10) Each recipe has a \\"what this recipe shows\\" section, but the recipes themselves are so fraught with shortcomings that it is difficult to believe that the recipes really demonstrate the declared principles.<br /><br />11) unless your kitchen is very warm (e.g. Manhattan in the summer), the stated times for a dough rising, in some cases as little as 1/2 hour, is not sufficient.<br /><br />12) her modus operandus is roughly this: make a recipe, then claim that various ingredients have certain effects. Such claims are easy to prove or disprove, just do the recipe without the ingredient in question. Yet, there is no evidence that the author has tested any of the claims in the \\"what this recipe shows\\" section; the claims she makes seem to be a combination of educated guessing and wishful thinking.<br /><br />13) In \\"At a Glance, Yeast Bread Problems\\", many of the problems she lists have more likely solutions that she does not list.<br /><br />I beg the gentle readers' forgiveness for giving detailed criticism of only the first chapter. These reviews are limited to only 1000 words, and, besides, I got tired of keeping track of the author's inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims.  Suffice it to say the other chapters in this book were no more reliable than the bread chapter.  The vegetable and emulsified sauce recipes were quite good, whereas the meat ones were not.<br /><br />On page 11 the author says that (bread) flour is 5.6 oz., but on page 139 states that a cup of (cake) weights 4.6 oz. So, if you randomly pick a recipe with flour and forget to check page 140 (and remember that the author uses scoop and sweep),  you will use the wrong amount of flour since the author specifies flour volume, not weight, and does not specify measurement method in any flour-based recipe.a \\"what this recipe shows\\" section, but the recipes themselves are so fraught with shortcomings that it is difficult to believe that the recipes really demonstrate the declared principles. <br />11) unless your kitchen is very warm (e.g. Manhattan in the summer), the stated times for a dough rising, in some cases as little as 1/2 hour, is not sufficient.   <br />12) her modus operandus is roughly this: make a recipe, then claim that various ingredients have certain effects.

If you are a foodservice professional, this book is for you. If you are an average home cook, forget it. Note that the copyright date is 1998; all recipes are identified by restaurant and chef, but since then, virtually all chefs listed are no longer with the restaurants listed, and some restaurants have since closed.<br /><br />If you are a professional pastry chef, you should immediately buy this book if you do not already have it. It is a collection of the actual production recipes of the many wonderful chocolate desserts from the PBS series.  The recipes seem to be reliable, time-proven, and battle-tested.  Just bring in a photocopy of a particular recipe, and any restaurant with a full-time pastry chef should be able to execute the recipe without a problem.  Note that all recipes include garnishing and plate presentation instructions (of course, there is no reason you cannot substitute standard, in-house decorating techniques). Note that you will find the original recipe for individual, warm chocolate cakes invented by Vongerichten.<br /><br />For the home pastry chef, the situation is a little more difficult, but this book is still a valuable resource. Many of the complicated recipes are really multi-component assembly jobs that require many preliminary steps, patience, and planning, but not culinary skill per se.  Many recipes contain advanced garnishes that are beyond most home pastry chefs, but in these cases you can simply substitute your favorite garnishing techniques (indeed, many of the recipes only need a spritz from a can of supermarket whipped cream, or some in-season raspberries or strawberries).  It is a useful exercise to pick one particular dessert component (ganache, mousse, flourless cake, chemically leavened biscuit, egg foam based biscuit, etc.), and do every one in the book to find ones that you wish to add to your repertoire. The recipes work, and many are of extremely high quality.<br /><br />If you are the average home cook, you should avoid this book. In the introduction, the editor states that some of the recipes are simple to do. Indeed, some of them are so simple that anyone who has baked a cake before can do them. Sadly, there is no way for the home cook to know which are which. A difficulty rating system or a separate section of recipes suitable for home cooks would have been a big help.<br /><br />The format of the book has significant shortcomings. Some of the recipes have pictures, and they are indeed labeled with the recipe they come from. Unfortunately, there is no listing or cross-reference of the pictures. So, if you are going to do a recipe and want to know if it has a matching picture (not all recipes have a matching picture), you have to physically leaf through all the pictures to see if one exists. A listing of the page numbers on all recipes that have matching pictures or a picture page reference with each recipe would have been helpful.  The table of contents is virtually non-existent. The book has 200 pages with at least half that many recipes, but the table of contents lists only the four chapters of the book: cakes, tarts, souffles, and white chocolate. A complete listing of recipes in each chapter or some sort of chapter sub-division listing would be a big help; as is, if you are looking for something particular, you have to either leaf through the whole book, or comb the index.<br /><br />Many of the chocolate decorative touches require either tempered chocolate or artificial chocolate \\"coating\\", but the subject is never mentioned. The instructions in the last chapter on melting and then sculpting semi-sweet or bitter-sweet chocolate are wrong. I suspect that the editor does not understand the subject of chocolateering (the editor should also note that by definition, a mousse is not baked; see page 129). Also note that there is positively no information on brands or types of chocolate, techniques, or necessary equipment; therefore, you must already have this info before using this book.  The same ingredient is spelled differently: p. 14 has \\"poho berries\\", while p. 154 has \\"poha berries\\" (FYI: I have never tasted them, but both recipes list raspberries as a substitute); a case of sloppy editing.  Speaking of sloppy editing, some recipes are missing the odd step or two; I expect that a professional pastry chef or a talented amateur to be able to fill in the missing information.  Creme Anglaise is consistently listed as \\"English Cream\\" (huh?). The cooking instructions for custards and creme anglaise are inadequate unless you have done them before and know what the correct endpoints are.<br /><br />The last chapter, apparently done by the editor, is full of incorrect recipes: chocolate garnishes, pulled sugar, simple syrup (the correct ratio of water/sugar is 1/1 by weight, not 2/1), coulis, and creme anglaise, not to mention the ridiculous notion of shelling your own macadamia nuts.<br /><br />There are also a number of recipes from Hawaiian restaurants. These are probably meant as a promotion for a brand of chocolate produced by a plantation in Hawaii. I find these recipes to generally be of lower quality than the other recipes; indeed, there are only a couple of recipes in the entire book that I suspect of not working, and they are both from Hawaiian restaurants. I have taste-tested the brand of chocolate they are trying to promote, and find it to be inferior to chocolate produced locally in SF, namely Guittard and Ghirardelli, not to mention Scharffenberger.colate, techniques, or necessary equipment; therefore, you must already have this info before using this book.

This all-purpose cookbook is both very good and very disappointing. It is reliable, but more trendy than it is historically illuminating (the recipe selection is more akin to the last couple of years than earlier ones in its history). In the end, this cookbook is a pointless exercise; thumbs down unless you are already a fan of the magazine in its current incarnation. I believe that the appointment of the current editor of Gourmet was a mistake (it demonstrates the danger of giving preference to food journalists over battle-tested, seasoned foodservice professionals), as is this cookbook.<br /><br />Gourmet magazine has been around since WW2. Be warned that this cookbook is not a collection of the best recipes to have ever appeared in the magazine, which is disappointing considering the historical archives available to the editors.  The recipes chosen are only those that pass muster as current, trendy recipes that would be suitable for publication in a current issue of the magazine, or an old recipe that has been jazzed up.  A whole galaxy of traditional, old-fashioned recipes is automatically excluded because they do not suit the editors' rather trendy tastes. In this case, I seriously question the editors' choices (to be fair, she does mention \\"negotiations\\" when it came to recipe selections; I suspect that the lead editor-who is relatively new to her job at Gourmet-had final say over the objections of other editors who have been with the magazine for more years), and the recipe selection would have been better left to a company historian. In terms of tinkering with standard recipes, the earlier chapters (appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, starch, grains, seafood, meat, vegetables) are more flagrant violators than the later ones (bread, brunch, cookies, cakes, pies, fruit, custards, ices, condiments).<br /><br />On the other hand, I love cooking magazines because they have a fully staffed test kitchen, and all the recipes are tested, idiot-proof, and always work as advertised.  I love their compendium cookbooks even more, because you get a cookbook full of recipes that actually work (I have many cookbooks authored by famous, celebrity super-chefs that are full of recipes that simply do not work). Here, you get a reliable, comprehensive cookbook full of dependable recipes.  If you need that last minute recipe that absolutely must work, this is the book to use.<br /><br />Another positive feature is that the authors are fastidious about listing the exact yield, active kitchen time, recipe duration, and storage information for each and every recipe. This is a feature I wish that more cookbook authors would emulate.<br /><br />It has a few problems:<br /><br />1) One major problem is the lack of organization. The Table of Contents lists each chapter title, but that is all.  A listing of the chapter sub-divisions or a complete list of chapter recipes is lacking.  This is a major deficiency, since many chapters are over 100 pages with over 100 recipes. So, to find anything, you either have to carefully comb through the index or flip your way through a 100 pages of text to get the recipe you need.<br /><br />2) Also absent is a difficulty rating. Easy recipes are right next difficult ones requiring some culinary skill, but the text gives no warning.<br /><br />3) Many recipes call for specialty gourmet ingredients that can be difficult to find (it would have been more useful if the editors had consciously limited the recipes to use only common, easily available ingredients).  Worse, substitutes are rarely recommended.<br /><br />4) It contains no information (except in a few scattered sidebars) on recommended kitchen tools, basic cooking techniques, or ingredients; it assumes you already know these things.<br /><br />5) For Tarragon Lobster Salad, after boiling 4 live lobsters, you are admonished to \\"Discard tomalley, any roe, and shells\\". Excuse me?<br /><br />6) Even familiar classics, have been tinkered with and updated (one has to admire the editors' gall, if nothing else).<br /><br />7) The ingredients called for show a strong regional (NYC) prejudice.<br /><br />8) each recipe has a nice preliminary description, but they often include phrases like: \\"new twist\\", \\"our updated version\\", \\"we lightened the dish\\", \\"contemporary\\", \\"we prefer\\", \\"adapted\\", \\"whole new dimension\\", \\"more robust\\", \\"but it's also fun to do something different\\", \\"taking an old classic to new heights\\", \\"a new, very appealing way\\", \\"our upscale, lightened take\\", \\"a novel and easy way\\", \\"a sophisticated spin\\", \\"unique\\", \\"we made a further innovation\\", \\"there's always room for improvement\\", \\"our variation\\", \\"a modern twist\\", \\"this lightened version\\", \\"these will surprise you\\", \\"they taste different too\\", \\"we've shaken things up a bit\\", \\"more refined than the original\\", \\"we think ours is the best\\", \\"we set out to improve the recipe\\", and \\"we've modernized it\\". The editor is clearly trying to re-invent the wheel.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to discover one of the better cookie books on my bookshelf.<br /><br />The author is reasonably fastidious about including enough detail in both introductory cookie basics and the recipes to assure success, even by someone who may not be an experienced baker. For example, all recipes specify how many minutes to cool the cookie on the baking sheet before spatulating them to a cooling rack. Over time, I have successfully done a number of different cookie recipes from this book.<br /><br />The selection of recipes is something to consider before buying this book. It has a good selection of about 150 recipes, but most of them are current, trendy, home-spun cookies you would expect to find in a mass market magazine. One wonders how many of these recipes will be ones that you will still want to do 10 years from now (the book's copyright is 2001).  The author claims to have gone through antique cookbooks and family heirloom recipe files to get the best of traditional cookies (rugelach, sables, and Pennsylvania Dutch raisin pockets) and to slightly update and correct the recipes. The result, however, is a recipe collection that can hardly be called traditional (hazelnut honey caramel bar, pineapple coconut macadamia thumbprints, chocolate espresso white chocolate chunk, fantastic fudgewiches). A number of the cookies seem to have originated from the health concious 70's and 80's.<br /><br />There are some deficiencies in the recipes:<br /><br />1) To check the doneness, one bakes until just firm or barely firm, but the meaning of this is not explained.<br /><br />2) For some doughs one is to measure out to the size of a golf ball, others give an inch specification. Those who do not golf and have never touched a golf ball will therefore be obliged to rush out to the sporting goods store for some recipes.<br /><br />3) For the last bit of flour in some recipes, one is to fold or stir in. There is no information about this critical but often frustrating step.<br /><br />It has cookie chapters on sugar, chocolate chips, chocolate, brownies, fruit (yuck), nuts, oatmeal (double yuck), spice, and decoration projects (including such useful things as edible tempera paint, gingerbread house, stained glass cookies, colored sanding sugar, royal icing).r in some recipes, one is to fold or stir in.

It is a rare combination of 2 things that I enjoy every much: rich and fattening cookies, and recipes that work.<br /><br />This book has 475 cookie recipes that have all been thoroughly tested by the test kitchens at Better Homes and Gardens. As such, every recipe I have ever done from this book has worked the first time through. With this many cookies, you are sure to find a recipe that fills the bill, and you will find rarities such as rosettes, cookie gun recipes, and pizzelle. There were some that I did not like, but that is not because the recipe was faulty, but because I just didn't like the cookie (this is especially true of the some of the bar cookies).  This is also a handy book if you have youngsters who want to help you make cookies: the recipes won't fail you, and there are several \\"smiley face\\" sort of cookies that will appeal to children, and also many bars that are easy to do, even for children.<br /><br />Also commendable is the format. The book is plastic spiral bound, which means that the book lies flat on the table when you are trying to do a recipe from it.  Each recipe has a full page devoted to it, meaning that the text is nice and large and easy to read, and the recipe is nicely spread out over the printed page and not just jammed into a corner of it.<br /><br />There are a few problems:<br /><br />1) the most aggravating of which is side-bar mania, that is the placing of important information about techniques, ingredients, and equipment in random places throughout the book where you will never find them when you need them.<br /><br />2) The actual introductory material on how to bake cookies in general in the first chapter is rather scanty. If all the above mentioned side-bars where collected and put into the first chapter, it might make for a decent primer on cookie making.<br /><br />3) at one point, the authors suggest that you boil dried fruits in brandy on the stove.  This sounds like a good recipe for a kitchen fire.<br /><br />4) the chapter on bar cookies, in a side bar, admonishes you to always use the correct size pan. By my count, however, the chapter uses 5 different pan sizes, and you are unlikely to have all of them. Would it have been that much trouble to standardize all the bar recipes to one or two pan sizes?<br /><br />5) this book had its share of marginal recipes: those that used mixes or store-bought cookie doughs, plus all those that have oats and/or dried fruit in them.<br /><br />6) The flour measurement is spoon-and-sweep, but this important information is buried in a section titled \\"What makes cookies too dry?\\"<br /><br />It has the following chapters (the chapter titles were too cute by half): Cookie Basics, Sweet Spoonfuls, Heavenly Hand-Shaped Cookies, Mold and Pressed Shapes, Slices of Delight, Rolling Pin Favorites, Fabulous Filled Cookies, Simple Shortcuts, Best Bars and Brownies.a good recipe for a kitchen fire. <br />4) the chapter on bar cookies, in a side bar, admonishes you to always use the correct size pan.

This book is not one of the better cookie books, and I suggest that you avoid it.<br /><br />There were a few bright spots. Each recipe is generously formatted on one page, so you will not need to break out the reading glasses to read the recipes. Each recipe also comes with a full color picture so you can see what the end result will be, which is a nice editorial decision that I wish more cookbooks would emulate.  I also noted that the recipe procedures have all been standardized (virtually all cookie recipes call for ungreased cookie sheets), so that if you can do one cookie, you can do all of them. Interestingly, although I got a couple of really good chocolate chip cookie variations, the non-cookie recipes were actually more interesting than the cookies, viz: White Chocolate Pudding (a new twist on a venerable classic), Rum-Soaked Chocolate Malibu (layered chocolate cake, rum syrup, ganache frosting), White Ivory Cream Cake (white chocolate cake and white chocolate ganache frosting), and Caramel Fudge Mac Tart (pate sucree, ganache, caramel, toasted nuts). Were it not for the paucity of recipe steps, this book would make a fairly interesting chocolate cookbook (tarts, assembled cakes, pudding, ice cream cakes, and candies).<br /><br />The problems are many:<br /><br />1) the book title, as only half of the recipes are for cookies<br /><br />2) there are no basic instructions for beginners (or anyone else, for that matter) on how to actually make and bake cookies<br /><br />3) the book only refers to \\"electric mixer\\", and does not specify hand-held or stand, but one infers from the procedures that the author intends the latter, one picture of a hand held not withstanding.<br /><br />4) the method of flour measurement is never specified (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.).  This will significantly alter the cookie texture.<br /><br />5) it is often difficult to tell if the cookies will be thin and crispy, thick and cakey, toll-house like, etc. You can sometimes tell from the picture, sometimes not, and there are no descriptions of the end cookie result.<br /><br />6) interestingly, most of the cookies specify an ungreased cookie sheet, but many of them spread considerably in the oven.<br /><br />7) many of the recipes do not specify how to tell when a cookie is done baking. Some specify and time range only, while others give vague descriptions: \\"until set\\", but the author does not tell what this means.<br /><br />8) the recipes are often lacking in important steps or sufficient information on unusual or difficult steps. For example, the author expects you to already know how to make and fold meringues, and how to use a pastry bag.<br /><br />9) some recipes are difficult, but the procedures give no warning, and even here the steps are casually tossed off in a few sentences.<br /><br />10) the introductory information is ambiguous: are you suppose to use a regular cookie sheet, or an insulated one?

Even a very good baking book will have, at most a couple of dozen cookies. On the other hand, the results were rather variable and not totally reliable (one person, one oven, one typewriter, what did you expect?). The experienced baker will have a treasure trove of recipes that require a little fine tuning, while the neophyte will probably be met with more than a few disappointments.<br /><br />The best part of this book is that each recipe has a picture of the cookie.<br /><br />The bad part is everything else. The biggest problem is the flour measurement: it only lists cups, but does not list an equivalent weight, nor the method of flour measurement (spoon and sweep, scoop and sweep, etc.). The way flour is measured can mean the difference between a perfect cookie and a hockey puck.<br /><br />The results were variable: cookies that spread too much, cookies that were dry and crumbly, bar cookies that were either over or under baked, instructions where it is not always clear when something is properly baked, etc.<br /><br />The biggest problem is also its strongest point: all cookies are arranged alphabetically on the first word of the cookie name.  This can be a big problem for, say shortbread. If you look under shortbread, you will find nothing. However it can be found under butterscotch, ginger, peanut butter, almond, Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, nut, American, and scotch. Buried at the back of the book where you will never find it, is a cross reference list of all recipes organized by cookie type (bar, drop, formed, nonedible, refrigerator, and rolled). It is here that you will have to do research to find the cookie that you want.<br /><br />Important note for experienced cookie bakers: this a very handy reference book to keep on your bookshelf. Regardless of what type cookie you want, you will probably find it here. Just keep in mind that the recipes have not been vetted, and you should do a couple of trial runs in order to correct the recipes. If you are a professional doing a catering job that requires you to put out a platter of at least 2 dozen types of cookies, I can think of no better resource than this one.tted, and you should do a couple of trial runs in order to correct the recipes.

Despite a drastically different approach by the author this time around (real kitchen experiments as opposed to just spinning endless yarns loosely based on a myriad, unfootnoted sources), the results are similar: closer to Danielle Steel than Scientific American.  If you liked this book's predecessor, then you will certainly like this one; if you thought it was worthy of a garage sale, you are unlikely to have a different view of this sequel.<br /><br />This book has 2 distinct parts. The first one (190 pages) has eleven chapters, each focused on a specific subject and a series of related kitchen experiments that are fully documented. The nicely systematic approach of the author reminds one of a similar technique used by Cooks Illustrated magazine for their recipe development. The subjects are: cooking meat, oil splatter, simmering meats, green color of vegetables, de-gassing sun chokes, buerre blanc, hollandaise and bearnaise sauces, mayonnaise, artificial ripening of persimmons at home, fruit ices, and miscellaneous. Some of this material is of substantial practical value: the chapters on sun chokes and fruit ices have good recipes you can actually use. Those who are mystified by buerre blanc, hollandaise, or mayonnaise, or who have trouble making them, will find the appropriate chapters quite enlightening.<br /><br />The second part, consisting of 6 chapters (120 pages) is mostly drivel. 3 chapters are devoted to the kind of stuff you can find in health magazines at the supermarket checkstand: dietary fat and heart disease, food and cancer, Alzheimer's and aluminum cookware. 3 chapters are devoted to a bit of culinary history: Brillat-Savarin, Maillard.<br /><br />In the end, reading this book is fun, but I would not take the information it presents too seriously.	2005-06-25

You can get a bewildering array of them from supermarkets, summer fesivals, webtailers, etc. I found only a couple of them that passed muster (Chris & Pitts; Everett & Jones). I also neglected to keep a diary of what I sampled, and what I thought of them.<br /><br />This book has already done most of the groundwork for you. It is sort of like a field guide that you take with you to the store or web site when you want to buy some BBQ sauce. It has reviews, descriptions, and pictures of at least 200 different ones. Although I have violent disagreements about some of the opinions, for the most part the book is an extremely valuable and useful resource.<br /><br />It categorizes sauces into 3 types: sweet, tangy, and fiery. There are some recipes at the end, but I would not take these very seriously. It serves as a good starting point for those who would like to explore the wonderful world of bottled BBQ sauces. For example, I discoverd Gates from this book, and it explains why I hate KC Masterpiece and Bull's Eye, but like Kraft. It is also a good resource to help you avoid those BBQ sauces that taste like pancake syrup with a little ketchup and tabasco sauce.<br /><br />Also note that there a many boutique brands in this industry. Many in this book are no longer available, and many have sprung to life since this book was published in 1999.	2005-06-17

It is extremely entertaining, but the reader is obliged to take the information in the book with a rather large grain of salt. This book is an entertaining blend of fact, fiction, and pop science. It is an interesting and entertaining read, as long as one does not take its information too literally. Reading this book is quite enjoyable, if you do not take it too seriously. The writing is friendly, chatty, and very approachable. It might be safer to regard this book as a quaint and entertaining collection of stories, rumor, pop science, and old wives tales rather than a serious scientific or culinary resource.<br /><br />There are many sections were one may dispute with the author, but this review is limited to 1000 words:<br /><br />1) The historical material is a collection of old wives tales, apocryphal stories, conventional wisdom, and culinary hearsay. Some of it is demonstrably wrong, but not any more so than other cookbooks that try to illuminate culinary history. The author is skating on thin ice much of the time.<br /><br />2) the origin of the word \\"mold\\" (as in cheese) is not the Latin \\"aerugo\\", but the Old Norse word \\"mygla\\" and the Swedish \\"mogel\\". Had the author bothered to check the OED, he would have discovered his error.<br /><br />3) many claims (adding salt makes scrambled eggs cook faster), especially in the egg chapter, have obviously not been tested by the author, making most of the scientific claims of dubious practical value.<br /><br />4) the section \\"Meat in the Human Diet\\" degenerates into political twaddle.<br /><br />5) the section on meat cookery is pitifully short and uninformative.<br /><br />6) the brief section on chemical leavening is a reasonably straight forward subject that is poorly explained and only partially correct.<br /><br />7) The last 2 sections on food science and physiology (along with the appendix that tries to explain basic chemistry) demonstrates pop science at its worst: inaccurate and not terribly illuminating. Those with a BS degree will cringe at the author's genuine lack of scientific understanding.<br /><br />8) the last chapter on cooking methods and utensil materials is disappointingly inaccurate, brief, and lacking in practical value.<br /><br />9) the section on lactose intolerance is downright wrong.<br /><br />The author's style is especially troubling:<br /><br />1) the author could have used the services of a good editor, as much of the writing is verbose, poorly disciplined, and lacking in focus.<br /><br />2) trying to decipher the real meaning of some of the author's paragraphs can be fun, especially for students of the English language.<br /><br />3) \\"authoritative\\" is not one of the words I would use to describe this book.<br /><br />4) Much of the information can be easily had in standard food science and botany textbooks (but, of course, these can be expensive).<br /><br />5) the information is not footnoted, making verification difficult<br /><br />There were a few bright spots:<br /><br />1) a spot checked on the etymology revealed that it is mostly correct.<br /><br />2) the science is mostly correct and occasionally enlightening<br /><br />3) it was written in 1984, so some information (especially relating to things found in the grocery store) is obsolete. The author has since updated this book.<br /><br />4) the extensive coverage of food subjects makes the phrase \\"comprehensive\\" an apt one.<br /><br />5) criticisms aside, I enjoyed reading this 630 page tome for its entertainment value (but not as a fountain of impeachable information), much as one reads a Shakespeare play. The scanning electron microscope pictures were particularly interesting.<br /><br />6) the chapter on alcohol is unusually focused and well-written. One suspects that it was carefully crafted and published before the book.<br /><br />Part 1 on Foods (500 pages) has chapters on: dairy, eggs, meat,fruit and vegetables, grains, bread, sauces, sweets, alcohol, and additives. Part 2 on human physiology (60 pages) has chapters on: nutrition and digestion. Part 3 on cooking principles (50 pages) has chapters on: food molecules, and cooking methods and utensils. The appendix (15 pages) is a chemistry primer.s. Part 2 on human physiology (60 pages) has chapters on: nutrition and digestion.

Yet, this one cookbook is the only you really seem to need. It covers virtually every dish you could possibly want to do, plus a few more you will never do (beaver, squirrel, turtle). It is sort of like 3 or 4 dozen current, best-seller cookbooks condensed into one, useful volume.<br /><br />The real secret of this cookbook is often overlooked. At one point, the author admitted that she was a terrible cook. She reasoned that if she could do a recipe, then anyone could. She was positively correct. No matter what your skill or experience, you can safely explore the recipes in this book without too many failures. In fact, this is the book that originally taught me how to cook when I was college student (that, and the Chef Mike Roy Show, the first cooking show on TV I ever saw, when I lived in LA as a teenager).<br /><br />This version of Joy has plastic spiral bounding, meaning that it will lie flat on the table while you do a recipe from it.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: this is the older version, not the newly re-written and totally messed up version.	2005-06-17

In this modern re-write, the new editors have completely demolished a venerable and valuable classic.<br /><br />I am not sure what sort of stuff the new editors were smoking when they came up with the idea for this re-write of Joy, but they must gotten a hold of some really good stuff, judging by the peculiar results. As it stands, it is mostly a cut-and-paste affair, cribbing from many cookbooks you probably already have. Note carefully that the \\"new\\" material is of substantially lower quality and value than the original material. It is now a typical trade hardback that you would expect to find in the cut-out bin at the book store. I am not sure why the authors thought it necessary to do this re-write.

The goal is to link and explain professional cooking techniques and attitudes to artistic endeavor. Much like a textbook that tries to explain painting fine art to a neophyte, the results were practically worthless.<br /><br />This book has 3 distinct elements, so I will treat each one separately (sort of like a bad restaurant dish that does not quite come together). The first part is the culinary artistry part, which I found to be pretty inconsequential. The second part is a very useful reference for matching ingredients and flavors. The last part is a collection of lists and menus.<br /><br />The first part is mostly a polemic trying, without much success, to link food to artistic endeavor. At least, it explains why so much restaurant food, especially those from famous restaurants and/or chefs is, quite frankly, pretty lousy.  It is trying to fire your imagination and intellect in an attempt to equate culinary with artistic ability (at the very least, it proves, unintentionally, that the latter is mostly unrelated to the former); this aspect of the book I found to be unconvincing and mostly boring (e.g. flat food vs. architectural presentation). The writing here rarely advances beyond thumb-sucking (interesting to the writer, but not the reader).  It sort of reminded me of those inspirational talks by outside gurus hired by Fortune 500 companies to bolster sagging employee morale, presented with almost religious fervor.  On the other hand, it was enjoyable to read so many quotes by famous chefs about their craft (Waters, Bayless, Vongerichten, Palladin). There are a few gems here, like the admission that 95% of fusion cuisine does not work. Also, if you are already in foodservice and aiming for fame and stardom, you owe it to yourself to read this book and pay careful attention to what it is saying.<br /><br />The reference portion of this book I found to be of immense practical value that I use on a regular basis, especially when I am stuck when seasoning or matching flavors for a food I am unfamiliar with (beef heart, cardoon, pig's ear) or have simply run out of ideas for (blackberries, chicken).  It has brief but valuable tables for: flavor pals, walk-in inventory, basic flavors, and seasonal goods. The heart of the book is a 130 page section (along with a 15 page section in a subsequent chapter) that cross references ingredients with other ingredients and flavors (there were some problems with this list: veal shank that does not list tomato-think osso bucco, or matching white rice with yogurt, yuck). The chapter on menus is also valuable, since it has main ingredients with matching flavors and side dishes, and also many complete menus from famous chefs and/or restaurants.<br /><br />The last third of the book is another thumb-sucker: inspirational menus and desert island lists. This section also contains a number of interesting recipes from the chefs quoted elsewhere in the book. It also has a number of interesting and complicated recipes that might be worth adding to your portfolio (for those that already have one).<br /><br />It has chapters on: chef as artist, meet your medium, composing flavors, composing a dish, composing a menu, evolving a cuisine, culinary art as communion, and various appendices.be of immense practical value that I use on a regular basis, especially when I am stuck when seasoning or matching flavors for a food I am unfamiliar with (beef heart, cardoon, pig's ear) or have simply run out of ideas for (blackberries, chicken).

The dust jacket proudly states that the author is airplane designer, plumber, and insect breeder all rolled into one appealing package; jack of all trades, and probably master of none. After reading the sophomoric first chapter, it was difficult to take this book seriously.<br /><br />The chapter on tempering chocolate on a marble slab and dipping fondant centers is too vague to be useful, although I have no doubt that the author is able to do it correctly. In the fondant chapter, the recipe he calls \\"Basic Fondant Center\\" is actually opera cream, which is a variation of fudge and not fondant per se. What is normally called fondant, the author terms \\"coating fondant\\". This chapter can be rather amusing to the experienced candy maker, as analyzing where the author went wrong is a good test of your knowledge.<br /><br />Two-thirds of the book is devoted to what the author calls professional candies at home: cream centers (fondant). This portion has chapters on tools, fondant, hard crack, clusters, french creams, chocolate creams, depositing funnel, bonbons, cordials, and crystallized centers. The rest of the book has a small number of traditional candies (including several from the Best Foods research kitchens), and a couple of brief chapters of non-allergenic and low calorie candies.<br /><br />A marble board is required for many of the recipes. For the most part, the author is attempting to translate commercial recipes for the home, which he does with little success (cf. \\"Bonbon Doctor\\", which includes a discussion of glacial acetic acid). In several instances, the author advocates the use of non-food grade ingredients, which is not safe.<br /><br />For the most part, the author is obsessed with cream centers; if this is your area of interest, this book may be of use to you. In the end, I see little reason to bother with this unusual book.	2005-05-21

When I have never baked something before and need a failsafe recipe, this is the first book I pick up. It is a good source of reliable, if fussy, recipes.  Although I have serious reservations about much in this book, I do recommend it, but not for the kitchen neophyte. It is disturbing how many best-selling baking and pastry books published in the last few years with a famous chef on the cover are chock full of recipes that simply do not work; Baking Illustrated is a happy exception.<br /><br />One myth about this book (produced by the same people who publish Cooks Illustrated magazine) should be dispelled from the beginning. It is not a collection of the best recipes of a particular baking or pastry item, nor is it an effort to take a classic, old fashioned recipe and do it correctly. Most of the recipes start out with a goal with a specific combination of texture, flavor, and appearance in mind (cf. brownies). The result very often is something that lacks the character you would normally expect from that dish. So, before you forge ahead with one of the recipes in this book assuming that it is the best of it's type, read the introductory material carefully to see the end result the authors were shooting for (as prime examples of a failure in this vein, I cite the recipes for Corn Muffins and Sacher Torte).  In particular, I object to the dampness of many of the chemically leavened baked goods. I also find the flavors generally to be bland. Not enough spice is fixed by adding more, but other problems like not enough richness or not sweet enough, is not easily fixed unless you are willing to re-engineer the recipe.<br /><br />This book has many shortcomings, but none of them fatal. The most vexing is side-bar mania: putting valuable information about ingredients, equipment or techniques in random places scattered throughout the book. Much of this information is generally applicable to many recipes and other books. This information is disorganized, making this potentially valuable book useless as a reference. It also suffers overlap from another ATK publication: The Dessert Bible. Both books plough similar ground, although the actual recipe overlap is not that substantial; however, you do not need both to them. The main difference being that the Baking Illustrated has breads (both quick and yeast), and the book other does not.  Given a choice, pick Baking Illustrated.  Note carefully that the recipes are generally more involved with more steps than a typical baking and pastry book. The emphasis here is on correct result, not easy and simplified recipe procedures and steps that will save you time. Some of the recipes are risible: expecting you to blind-bake a pie crust and make the filling, and have both recipes finish at exactly the same time (maybe after doing the recipe a half dozen times you can accomplish this); expecting you to have room in your refrigerator overnight for a sheet pan of dough.  You should also read the recipes carefully, as some take several days to finish.<br /><br />On the other hand, this book has many strengths. It is a team effort from a commercially viable test kitchen, meaning that it does not suffer from the prejudices or idiosyncrasies of one chef, famous or not.  The authors are careful to point out which mixing method is best: standing mixer, food processor, or wooden spoon and strong arm. They are not wedded to one particular mixing method, nor do they blithely claim that all mixing methods will work with all recipes.  They are also careful not to accept conventional wisdom or tradition for a recipe without thorough testing. This book has reliable versions of many recipes that are hard for the beginner to do correctly (cf. macaroons and meringue cookies). Many current baking and pastry books will quietly ignore those items that are staples but troublesome to do correctly (viz. pate a choux, angel food cake); this book merrily ploughs through each subject systematically, including those hard to do recipes. So, if you need a basic recipe, you will probably find it here done correctly.<br /><br />The most valuable aspect of this book is as a learning tool. If you are ready to move beyond the recipes in the newspaper or the back of the chocolate chip bag, this book is for you.  I found the chapter on yeast breads to be particularly interesting: they discover dough folding, yeast preferments, cold proofing, and autolyse. Note that all recipes are preceded by a rather detailed and long-winded narrative of how they came to the final version of each recipe.  These narratives are interesting and valuable learning tools you will not find anywhere else, even in culinary school.<br /><br />It has chapters on: quick breads, yeast breads, pizza, pies and tarts, pastry, fruit, cakes, and cookies.merrily ploughs through each subject systematically, including those hard to do recipes.

In spite of some shortcomings, I do recommend it for the dedicated home cook.  There are a number of older candy books, but are mostly out of print and date back 50 years or more; as such, they do not reflect current abilities or tastes. This book is the only complete one on confectionery I can think of published in recent years. This is a reprint of the original published in 1992.<br /><br />This book does a good job of representing those candies that people want these days. When they think of confectionery, they mainly are thinking of chocolate truffles and clusters; consequently, the first half of the book is devoted to just that. The second half contains chapters on caramel, brittles and marzipan, fudge and nougat, and fruit. The recipe instructions are well described and easy to follow. The sections on ingredients, techniques, and equipment are also important, as these subjects in older candy books are out of date and mostly worthless.<br /><br />There were some shortcomings, however. The description on tempering chocolate is brief, and leaves out many details. I object to the many ministrations that chocolate be put into the refrigerator. Many of the recipes in the second half call for hot sugar to be cooked to 240 degrees and beyond. This is the most dangerous thing in the kitchen to do (even more dangerous that deep-frying in oil), yet there are no instructions on how to do this safely.

When I need a quick and easy chocolate recipe, this is the one I go to first, and I strongly recommend it for the home baker.<br /><br />This book is not what it may appear to be.  It is not a compendium of chocolate recipes that have appeared in the pages of the Farm Journal Magazine over the years, nor is it a collection of recipes that reflect the tastes and culinary prejudices of a lone, female food editor.  It is the collective wisdom of thousands of home cooks and bakers. FJM collected some 10,000 chocolate recipes from its readers, then tested and selected the best ones and published them in this book.  The result is similar to those Pillsbury Bake-off cookbooks.<br /><br />For the most part, the recipes are the easy to do, mix-and-dump variety. They use ingredients and equipment that every home kitchen has. There are no recipes that require special ingredients that can only be obtained at one import deli in NY, nor ones that need a special pan that can only be ordered from Austria or Australia. Aside from a few recipes that use whipped egg whites and some cooked sugar recipes, none of the recipes are beyond the capabilities of the average home cook.<br /><br />There are some odd things, mainly because it is from 30+ years ago, and some recipes go back much further than that. Unsweetened chocolate is called for more often than milk or dark chocolate. It is one of the few cookbooks that specifically call for sifting flour directly into the measuring cup. The cocoa powder called for is always natural (the recipes do not specify which type, but in that decade, only the natural variety was available; Dutch processed type was rare). The chapter on cakes and the one on sauces I found to be better than the rest. Not all of the recipes are good; some sounded terrible. All the recipes (mostly cakes) I tried worked without trouble. There is no recipe listing in either the table of contents or chapter heads; to find a recipe, you either have to squint at the index or flip through entire chapters. There are no pictures.<br /><br />It has chapters on chocolate info, cakes, cookies, brownies, pies, desserts and sauces, fudge, and candy.  I did not really count, but there are probably 200 or so recipes.in either the table of contents or chapter heads; to find a recipe, you either have to squint at the index or flip through entire chapters.

I ordered it, and received a book with the correct ISBN. However, the title of it is \\"The Pillsbury Cookbook: The All-Purpose Companion for Today's Cook\\". I suspect that an Amazon employee made a data entry mistake: when typing the title for this ISBN, he typed in the wrong book title.<br /><br />I only browsed through this book since it is of little interest to me. However, it seems to be a standard family cookbook from the 1980's.	2005-03-24

For those who wish to learn this lost art, this book is as good as any you will find. I recommend it highly for those willing to devote the the time to the task.<br /><br />This book is designed as a self-guided course in the traditional art of confectionery and candy.  You are expected to go through the book from cover to cover, chapter by chapter, doing recipes and learning necessary skills.  This is definitely not a book for the casual home cook who wants to flip through the book and pick out a recipe at random that sounds appealing.  It is the only place I know of that shows you how to make your own fondant from scratch.<br /><br />The order of the chapters is important, and you should go through them one by one as recommended by the authors. They represent a reasonable course of instruction.  On the other hand, I would present the chapters in a slighlty different order: fudge, caramel, and nougat I would put towards the end, and put fruits, jellies, marzipan, and truffles first.<br /><br />Note that I have the 3rd edition published in 1983, so some of the recipes are 25 years out of date and no longer worth doing. I am also concerned about the lack of safety and sanitation information. One of the easiest ways to give yourself a nasty burn requiring a trip to the hospital is to have an accident while making some of the more dangerous types of candy. The recipes are not rated for safety, but probably should be.<br /><br />It has these chapters: easy-do candies, basics, confectionery coating, popcorn candies, fudge, caramel, nougat and divinity, marshmallow and jelly, truffle, fondant, chocolate molding, marzipan, fruit and nut, hard candies, european chocolates.	2005-03-19

If you are a working professional, it is very interesting but only of limited utility.<br /><br />In fact, this book is an update of \\"The Hotel and Restaurant Dessert Book\\" published in 1927. In terms of update, the authors seem to have done little more than drop in some recipes for cheesecake, cookies, and brownies. I do not have the original, so cannot say for sure how they updated or improved the original, but I suspect it was little more than normalizing ingredients and measurements.  One of the contributors is listed as a Johnson and Wales faculty member, but I doubt that his contribution was anymore than reviewing the galleys as a moonlighting gig.<br /><br />Every production kitchen has an official recipe notebook: looseleaf pages in a 3 ring binder (I know that this is suppose to be the electronic information age, but I have yet to see a kitchen that has its recipes on a PDA).  This interesting volume is one such notebook from a hotel pastry kitchen in the 1920's (some would say the pinnacle of Georgian dining elegance) that supported several different venues: buffets, a few sit down restaurants, room service, special events, catering. It is fascinating to see the rather plain white breads served, and the variety sherbets and ices available at the time but now extinct, even in very fine dining establishments.<br /><br />This book has only barebones recipes.  There is no educational or explanatory material.  When the recipe says \\"let proof twice\\" or \\"bring the syrup to 16 degrees Baume\\", you better know what are doing, since the recipes provide no further information than instructions like these.  I found the chapter on breads particularly useless.<br /><br />It has chapters on French and Viennese Pastry, petit fours and fancy cakes, puddings and sauces, cakes pies and quick breads, ices, and bread.  The table of contents has nothing more than the information in the previous sentence.

This one is the only one I seem to use or consult with any frequency, so I have gotten rid of all the others (actually, I also kept the one by the dominatrix, since it includes good lessons in knot tying). Highly recommended.<br /><br />Most sex manuals in print seem to be written either from inside a medical textbook or from watching romantic movies from film noir period (this criticism includes a famous doctor who has a TV show in current syndication).  The authors range from a dominatrix to a pair of milk toast sex therapists.<br /><br />For those who do not know, Xaviera Hollander was a big celebrity in the 1970's (her legacy includes a camp classic, \\"The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington\\" which stars Joey Heatherton, for those who remember her). She ran the largest call girl ring in New York City (a significant accomplishment when you consider her competition, which included the Mob), and wrote a couple of best-selling trade paperbacks about her adventures.  In the end, she was deported back to Holland, since she was here on a green card.<br /><br />Hollander was one of the most successful madams of all time (her girls commanded the highest prices, even by today's standards), making Heidi Fleiss look like an amateur by comparison.  She came to be so successful because she understands human sexuality so well (both male and female) and knew how to provide satisfaction. She became an unrivalled expert in these matters, since her business success depended on it. Another important factor is the fact that she genuinely enjoyed what she was doing and you could tell, and it was not just a way to line her pocketbook.<br /><br />The subjects in this book range from \\"belly-to-belly basics\\" to those things that are unusual, even by today's standards 3 decades later (since this is a family website, I will not go into specifics, but suffice it to say that the range of subjects covered are comprehensive). She has put all of her knowledge and various tricks and techniques into this useful and extensive instruction manual.  Note that this book is specifically about techniques, and not about the entire relationship.  The most important part of this book is the author's friendly, chatty, matter-of-fact attitude.  It is sort of like an experienced partner sitting next to you on the couch, telling you how to do various things.to say that the range of subjects covered are comprehensive).

A summary of the works of Magnus Hirschfeld	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Human Abnormal Sexuality Textbook	Magnus Hirschfeld was a famous clinical researcher on human sexual pathology and related disciplines (his career started in the 1890's and seemed to have spanned 4 or 5 decades). He was often called on as a legal expert on these subjects, as well as \\"treating\\" these problems.  This fascinating volume is a compendium of a lifetime of case histories regarding human sexual aberrant behavoir (at any rate, this is what it used to be called; these days, a lot of this stuff has entered the mainstream).<br /><br />Current societal credo is that society has become more liberal in accepting out-of-the-ordinary sexual behavoir, and that almost anything goes these days. After reading this volume, one begins to wonder.  Consider abnormalities in the genitalia in newborns: in the old days, midwives would simply say that he/she will grow out of it (as is documented in several case histories); today, the controversy is whether to snip or not to snip, In many of the case histories regarding abnormal tendencies, the men seemed to have often found willing partners/wives. One wonders how the typical girlfriend/wife would respond today when presented with a partner with such tendencies.<br /><br />This is a family website, so I will not summarize the various areas of behavoir covered in this book.  Suffice to say, however, the subjects presented cover a wide gamut of behavoir, some of it acceptable to current society (like the leather community), some of it not.<br /><br />This book is actually designed as a medical clinical reference, and not one for public consumption. The language is objective and even somewhat stodgy. Much of the vocabulary is technical medical terminology.  For people who have such sexual anomalous behavoir/physiology, anyone in a relationship with such a person, or clinical professional who deals with such stuff (especially underground sexual society), this book is a rare, complete, and objective non-judgemental resource and highly recommended.  If nothing else, it is fascinating to read about this stuff and how society used to deal with it.<br /><br />This book was published in 1948, after the author's death. He never finished the manuscript, and it was finished and published by his students.else, it is fascinating to read about this stuff and how society used to deal with it.  <br /> <br />This book was published in 1948, after the author's death.

Just flip to the chapter you want and leaf through all the recipes until you find one that suits you.  Unfortunately, I am not confident enough in the reliability of the recipes as a whole to recommend it. Interesting, but best avoided.<br /><br />The author claims to have tested each recipe, but I doubt the veracity of this statement. It almost seems as if this book did not have an editor at the publisher. This is definitely a case where quantity trumps quality (I would be happier with fewer but higher quality recipes, but then you probably would not have a 1001 of them, either).<br /><br />In the muffin section:<br /><br />1) it is humorous to see basically the same recipe 500 times<br /><br />2) the batter measurement and/or yield information is often wrong<br /><br />3) each recipe has a picture, but many pictures are either wrong or next to the wrong recipe<br /><br />4) textures ranged from pasty to dry to undercooked<br /><br />5) few recipes worked correctly<br /><br />6) sub-division of this long section would have been helpful: sweet vs. savory, flour vs. whole grain vs. biscuit mix, mix and dump vs. whipped egg whites, etc.<br /><br />7) author uses 4 different muffin pan sizes, seemingly at random (the sizes are: 2.0, 2.25, 2.75, and 3.0 inches diameter).<br /><br />8) many recipes are wrong: missing ingredients, missing recipe steps, incorrect ingredients.<br /><br />9) the yields go all over the place, ranging from 3 muffins to 4 dozen; would it have been that much trouble to standardize all the recipes to yield 6 or 12 muffins using one size muffin tin?<br /><br />10) the recipe names are not consistent: some muffins that use cocoa powder are called \\"chocolate muffins\\", while others are called \\"cocoa muffins\\".<br /><br />11) the amount of baking powder seems to be excessive in many recipes.<br /><br />12) some of the ingredients make no sense: \\"lecithin granules\\" (fyi: 1 teaspoon of lecithing is enough for 20 -40 pounds of product)? 2 T of \\"dried grated orange zest\\" for only a dozen muffins (perhaps the author is thinking of candied orange peels)?<br /><br />13) muffins with egg and fat only, no liquid<br /><br />14) a majority of the recipes have one or more whole grain ingredients, so if you want a muffin with just plain, old flour, your choices are limited (many of the recipes seem to be cribbed from cookbooks from the \\"health concious\\" 70's and early 80's).<br /><br />I have similar complaints about the inconsistency and sloppiness of the other chapters in the book (here, I am referring to the editing and recipe quality, not the mess it makes in your kitchen). Consider, for example, mixing methods. The one used for muffins is perfect, the one for biscuits is wrong, and the one for coffee cakes is hopelessly confused.  Page 295 has the ingredient \\"Whipped Cream Topping (see recipe page XXX)\\"; good luck trying to find it, because it is not listed in the index and I am not flipping through 480 pages of recipes to find it.  Contrary to what the author states on page 307, the origin of what we know today as \\"quick bread\\" is English high tea, not holiday celebrations.  Many of the quick bread recipes did not have enough liquid; they make adequate substitutes for gypsum board, but were not suitable for human consumption (I would love to make a joke about even the dog not wanting to eat them, but I do not have a dog).  It is also the only cookbook I know of that calls for distilled spirits in generous quantities as a baking ingredient, from 1/2 to 1 cup of rum, brandy, kirsch, creme de cacao, etc.  The quick breads come out of the oven looking and tasting like masonery bricks. Most of the scones I tried looked and tasted like hockey pucks.<br /><br />It has chapters on muffins (236 pages), biscuits (18 pages), cobblers (6 pages), doughnuts (10pages), quick breads (118 pages), pancakes (10 pages), popovers (6 pages), scones (28 pages), and waffles (12 pages).<br /><br />In general:<br /><br />1) in each chapter, the recipes are arranged alphabetically by title<br /><br />2) index is correlated by ingredient only<br /><br />3) a master list of all recipes would have been helpful<br /><br />4) index needs to be cross-referenced by recipe title, not just ingredients<br /><br />5) does not specify how flour is measured (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.)pages), scones (28 pages), and waffles (12 pages). <br /> <br />In general: <br />1) in each chapter, the recipes are arranged alphabetically by title <br />2) index is correlated by ingredient only <br />3) a master list of all recipes would have been helpful <br />4) index needs to be cross-referenced by recipe title, not just ingredients <br />5) does not specify how flour is measured (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-08

Unfortunately, this book is not as good as the bread.<br /><br />The highlight of the book is the bread in the first chapter, but I note the following deficiencies:<br /><br />1) The recipes for Pagnotta, ciabatta, pane toscano, and sfilatano (which all use the same dough) are not the ones I have eaten from the bakery.<br /><br />2) biga acida isn't. Their recipe may work in commercial bakeries that are laden with yeast spores in the air, but in a home kitchen that has never made bread, all you will get is moldy flour batter.<br /><br />3) all breads are kneaded and proofed in exactly the same time; I doubt that this is correct, since this will vary with the hydration level of the dough.<br /><br />4) The instructions call fo 20 + 5 minutes of manual kneading, and this is not correct. When I did it, they required a mere 10 minutes.<br /><br />5) the author commits the baker's sin of not specifying flour amounts by weights.<br /><br />6) when I did them, the rather informal nature of the recipes bothered me, as I was not sure that an amateur who has never made bread before will have success with them.<br /><br />7) when placing dough into the oven, all the recipes inveigh \\"with a rythmic snap of the wrist\\". Problem is, the author never fully explains what this means.<br /><br />8) I have similar complaints about the chapters on special breads, little breads, and pizzas.<br /><br />On the good side, the bread dough make-up instructions use kneading by hand, and not a mixer.  The recipe selection for the traditional bread chapter is very good, as it has all of the really popular ones that you would want.  On the other hand, the informal and friendly nature of the instructions will encourage more people to try them, and this is a good thing.<br /><br />I have not really gone through the recipes in the last 2 chapters on cookies or sweets. The recipe count is rather low - 13 and 16 respectively - but the recipes are the popular ones you will most want to do.  The problem here is that the instructions are rather informal. The procedures for Torta D'Alassio (like a Sacher torte that uses the modified creaming method and hazelnuts) and Pasta Frollo (tart dough) are not easy to do correctly, but the recipes are casually tossed off in a couple of brief sentences, in the same space it uses to describe how to do garlic toast. You will also need a hand-held electric mixer; no alternatives are provided.<br /><br />The book suffers from side-bar mania. Brief stories or helpful hints are in small, italicized type in side-bars that are of dark, brown color; they are difficult to read, even if the lighting at your reading table is very good.<br /><br />It has chapters on traditional breads, special breads, little breads, pizza, leftover bread recipes, cookies, sweets.low - 13 and 16 respectively - but the recipes are the popular ones you will most want to do.

If you are an experienced candy maker or confectioner, this book is a must-have. If you are an average home cook, however, you better forget about this book; it is definitely not for beginners.<br /><br />During the immediate post-WW2 era a few decades ago, the Pope's ran a highly respected candy cooking school in Chicago (now defunct). This book seems to have been intended as a recipe reference book for graduates of that school.  The introduction proudly states that many such people went on to start their own, successful candy business, presumably using the recipes in this book.<br /><br />Considering this book's milieu, it is not surprising that all of the recipes have been thoroughly battle tested. The most reliable and complete candy recipes I have ever seen are in this book (in fact, I have only 4 quibbles from the whole book: the suggestion to store milk chocolate in the refrigerator, the treatment of gelatin in the marshmallow recipe, melting chocolate in a warm oven; I also question the statement that their special brittle recipe does not need to be stretched, since you are suppose to flip it over and spread it thin with 2 forks, which amounts to the same thing).  This book is now out of print, and commands an obscenely high price as a used book. This book should be the source of all standard candy recipes for all those who make candy, whether amateur or pro. If you need a recipe for something, this is the first place to look. As such, this book is worth pretty much whatever price you have to pay for it.  The only problem is that the recipe amounts are for small batches on a home stove; if you need amounts for a commercial recipe (e.g. 10# or 20#), you will either have to multiply the recipes or consult a professional reference (e.g. \\"Choice Confections\\" by Walter Richmond).<br /><br />For the average home cook, the situation is a little different. This book, and many other candy books published contemporaneously, comes from an era where all women were homemakers who cooked 3 meals a day for her family and were expected to produce a panoply of candy every Christmas.  This era, along with the culinary skills accumulated by these housewives, is long gone. In order to use this book successfully, you would either have to be one of these stay at home moms or be a graduate of a candy cooking course. A typical example is the recipe for divinity: it states that you beat the egg whites \\"until they cling to bowl\\". An experienced candy maker knows exactly what the author is referring to, but probably not the average home cook who is making candy for the first time.  It assumes an awful lot of foundation skills that are not explained or indicated in the recipes.  Many of the pesky little details you need are not explained.<br /><br />Note that this book is a 3rd edition. I have not seen the 1st or 2nd editions, so am unable to tell you what the differences are.  It has chapters on measurements, ingredients, equipment, fondant, fudge, divinity, caramel, taffy, marshmallow, brittles, hard candies, popcorn, jelly, marzipan, chocolate dip, easter eggs, and a worthless chapter on using Pope-School proprietary rubber molds.many other candy books published contemporaneously, comes from an era where all women were homemakers who cooked 3 meals a day for her family and were expected to produce a panoply of candy every Christmas.

He hired Porges to record everything he did, so he would know what he did the first time when he got around to doing the complete Ring again (there was no second time). This book is an English translation of Porges' work. Its original title was \\"Die Buhnenproben zu den Bayreuther Festspielen des Jahres 1876\\". It is a rare, eyewitness account of Wagner performing one of his own operas.  I found it to be very interesting and recommend it for aficionados, as long as you do not set your expectations too high.<br /><br />First, this is not a day-to-day diary of everything Wagner said and did while staging the Ring. The manuscript seems to have been written after the fact, and often seems to be reflections and recollections. Porges' text sometimes degenerates into philosophical reflections or soap box rhetoric. This book does not go through the whole score line by line; it concentrates on some sections, while skipping over large chunks of others. The descriptions in this book are clearly addendum to the score, as the author often states (when dealing with a specific passage) that Wagner has nothing more to add than what is already in the score. In too many instances, one is left wondering if he is reading Wagner's thoughts or Porges'.<br /><br />The text is a handy exposition for those performing or staging the Ring as Wagner intended. One can only hope (fat chance) that every singer, stage director, opera designer, and conductor has a copy of this book in his/her pocket while performing or staging the Ring. It has detailed instructions for singers (gestures, acting, blocking, singing) and the orchestra and conductor (tempo, dynamics, phrasing). For example, the description of the famous Valkyrie scene is very different from how it is usually choreographed. Note that there is absolutely no information in regards to costumes, sets, props, lighting, or staging per se.<br /><br />It is fascinating to learn that Wagner expects specific gestures on specific notes, and how the singers' motions are to be strictly synchronized with the music. He also expects the orchestra and conductor to execute hairpin turns with tempo, markings, and dynamics. On the other hand, it is often unclear (I am not a trained musician, so this may not be strictly true) what musical technique is referred to by some of the flowery instructions. Example: during the daybreak music that interludes between the Norn scene and the duet, one reads that the orchestra must play \\"with that purely intuitive phrasing which stylistically is so superior to the crudely naturalistic manner (still rife among the Italians)\\".  The conflagration at the end of Gotterdammerung \\"demands of the conductor a grip of iron; like a Cyclopean wall the themes and melodies must pile themselves up before us\\". A colorful simile, but does this mean slow? Fast? Loud? Soft? With strong accents? With no accents?<br /><br />This is a rather slender, 145 page book measuring 6 x 9. Even then, much of the space on each page is taken up my musical staves. This is not a problem for those who do not read music, as most of the comments are keyed not only on specific musical notes, but also specific lines in the libretto.scinating to learn that Wagner expects specific gestures on specific notes, and how the singers' motions are to be strictly synchronized with the music.

Even then, much of the space on each page is taken up my musical staves. This is not a problem for those who do not read music, as most of the comments are keyed not only on specific musical notes, but also specific lines in the libretto.   <br />	2005-02-24
US	50042615	RLA56FBRLP73F	0809255448	498713566	Chocolate Artistry	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Good and Bad	This is one of those marginal books where I am not sure whether or not to recommend it. It has some rare and precious nuggets of information hard to come by in most of the popular, best-selling cookbooks. On the other hand, most of the artistry demonstrated is either strange or 30 years out of date. In the end, I do recommend it for dedicated, amateur pastry chefs or professionals who need to know how to temper and decorate with chocolate and confectionery coatings. For the average home cook, forget it.<br /><br />The first chapter is the most valuable: it has complete instructions on tempering chocolate. It is one of the few places I know of that describes all 3 methods: seeding, direct, and tabling. The instructions are detailed, have many pictures, and each method takes several pages. The second chapter is the only place I know of that describes how to use molds for chocolate.<br /><br />The next 3 chapters are little more problematic. You will find procedures for parchment piping cones, pastry bags, chocolate modeling clay, and flowers. On the other hand, only someone willing to spend a dozen or two afternoons practicing them will gain the ability to do them correctly (indeed, some of us never quite get the hang of it, and I count myself in that number). These are not easy to do. Another minor problem is that my pastry tubes are by Ateco; the tube numbers in the book are for the Wilton ones, so in some cases I have to guess what the correct number is.<br /><br />The rest of the book, 8 chapters worth, is of little value. There are complete instructions for various decorating tasks, but most are no longer current or interesting. Even here there are some bits worth doing: the chocolate strawberry tree, chocolate basket, filigree work, chocolate house, decorating cookies, and decorating cakes.	2005-02-23

In the 1890's, William Ashton Ellis translated them and they were published in English in 8 volumes. They were originally published by London:Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. as \\"Richard Wagner's Prose Works\\". In 1995, they were reprinted in this country.  Title not withstanding, this is volume 8 of that set. This volume contains various bits and pieces that were not a part of the original GS, and is more like an appendix to the original series. There are some important pieces, but in the end it is not that much more valuable than the other 7 volumes in the series.<br /><br />1)The first piece is the complete, original prose poem for Siegfried's Tod (50 pages). It has the happy ending where Siegfried and Brunnhilde enter Valhalla together rather than Ragnarok.<br /><br />2)The next section (200 pages) is labled by Ellis as \\"Discarded\\". These are not really discards, but were not included by Wagner probably because he did not have access to them while preparing GS. These works are essays, letters, and articles of little importance (you can probably skip every other sentence while reading them and not miss anything of importance).<br /><br />3)The next section contains sketches for potential operas: \\"Die Sarazenin\\" (25 pages) whose plot bears a striking similarity to Rienzi, \\"Das Liebesmahl der Apostel\\" (5 pages) which Wagner composed as an independent choral piece, and \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (60 pages), Wagner's risible attempt to rewrite the New Testament.<br /><br />4)The last section (60 pages) is a mish mash of unpublished fragments found in various manuscripts. It begins with \\"Kunstlerthum der Zukunft\\" - Artisthood of the Future (20 pages). In spite of its incomplete state, I found this essay to be more decipherable than most of Wagner's other pieces, but only because it contains his main points without the usual rhetorical conflations. You will also find a brief, one page prose sketch for \\"Die Sieger\\", another potential opera but this time about Ananda, Prakriti, and Buddha (here, the theme is unrequited love, and the plot is similar to Tristan).<br /><br />For those who are interested in the other 7 volumes of this series, here are the titles: The Art-Work of the Future (volume 1), Opera and Drama (volume 2), Judaism in Music (volume 3), Art and Politics (volume 4), Actors and Singers (volume 5), Religion and Art (volume 6), and Pilgrimage to Beethoven (volume 7). Note that the book titles were assigned by the American publishers (Bison Books), and are merely the name of just one of the essays in the book and do not constitute the entire book's contents.  The exception is Opera and Drama, which is a book-length essay constituting the entirety of volume 2.Sieger\\", another potential opera but this time about Ananda, Prakriti, and Buddha (here, the theme is unrequited love, and the plot is similar to Tristan).  <br /> <br />For those who are interested in the other 7 volumes of this series, here are the titles: The Art-Work of the Future (volume 1), Opera and Drama (volume 2), Judaism in Music (volume 3), Art and Politics (volume 4), Actors and Singers (volume 5), Religion and Art (volume 6), and Pilgrimage to Beethoven (volume 7).

It is entertaining, and endlessly fascinating.  However, the veracity of many of these memories is questionable, so the reader has to be careful about accepting the text at face value.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Richard Wagner, keeping the previous caution in mind.<br /><br />Literature about Wagner is not in short supply, and neither are analysis, critiques, and essays about his personality and behavior. It is refreshing to read first hand reports about him from a variety of viewpoints.  On the other hand, many of these brief letters and diary entries were written many years or even decades after the fact.  Some are obviously colored or altered by the eyewitness for various reasons. The childhood reminisces by Avenarius (Wagner's half-nephew) is a laughable prevarication, yet most writing about Wagner's childhood is based on it. Likewise, the account of Wagner's death by someone who was not there is also manufactured from whole cloth.<br /><br />I do have a few objections to the book's format. Each chapter merely has a year span as its title (1813-42, 1842-49, 1849-58, 1858-64, 1864-72, and 1872-83).  There is no listing in the table of contents or chapter heading of the names in that chapter.  Also, the date the reminisce was actually written is usually not listed.  Likewise for the specific date the encounter supposedly occurred, even then only in an elliptical footnote.	2005-01-28

It may be a little expensive, but it is easily the equivalent of at least a dozen other books on pastry with glossy, fancy photos and a big, famous name on the cover. If you are a professional who plans to advance your career, this book is a must have. Please note that this is volume 2 of the series; you are expected to go through the volumes in order, so this book assumes that you have already gone through and mastered volume 1.<br /><br />This book has a lot to offer the professional. Note that the emphasis on this volume is production. It goes beyond the basics of volume 1 (sanitation, making batters, proper baking techniques, etc.), while fancy, sophisticated decorations are reserved for volumes 3 and 4. The mini lessons in this volume are more or less equivalent to the instructions I got at culinary school. The great value here is that there are many more subjects in this book than in any cooking school class. If there is something you wish to do but never did at school, the recipes in this book will give you enough detail to do it successfully the first time through.<br /><br />Even for the home cook, there is much here of great value. Like cooking school, the lessons in this book are designed for cooks who may or may not have previous experience. If you are going to try something from this book, you must follow all the instructions to the letter, gather the necessary tools and ingredients, have patience, and expect to fail once or twice before you get the hang of it. Also, pay careful attention to the difficulty ratings to the recipes; the instructions make everything look easy, but this is misleading. If all you get out of this book is the proper method to make pastry cream and creme anglaise, a couple of candies, a decorated cake or two, a couple of tarts, and brioche, then this book is very worthwhile.<br /><br />There are a few cautions, however. I found some format problems: pictures mis-labeled, the butter cream section is messed up, etc. The original copyright date is 1985, and first published in English in 2000; this means that the patisserie here is probably 3 decades old, and much of it very out of fashion. Also, note the title is \\"Professional French Pastry\\", and bears little relation to pastry as it is commonly served here in the US. It's primary value is that of a training manual, and not a guide to current, trendy pastry trends or tricks.<br /><br />It has chapters on: basic creams, 2 chapters on secondary creams, confectionery, and finished pastries (pate a choux, cakes, tarts, puff pastry, and brioche presentation). The last section on finished pastries is by definition advanced, and occupies the second half of the book.re a few cautions, however.

It is good addition to your bookshelf and recommended highly.  The primary value of this book is completeness. No matter what type of meat or cut you have, there is a relevant chapter and recipes for it; this book covers it all. Systematically developing recipes for all types of meat must have been a daunting task. Although this book is seriously flawed, if you cook based on the wonderful piece of meat you got at the supermarket or butcher rather than cooking from a cookbook from a famous celebrity chef, this book is pretty much the only game in town and rather indispensable. My main warning about this book: the recipes are focused on the proper procedure and technique, not on what is easy or convenient; some of the fussiest recipes I have ever seen come from this meat cookbook (I will refrain from complaining about the futility of Yankees trying to cook oriental food, chili, or barbecue).<br /><br />The authors have focused on those wonky little details that are usually glossed over and can make or break a good meat dish: correct breading technique, meat thickness, internal temperature, proper resting method, etc. The first part of the book has a valuable catalog of meat cuts.  Each cut has alternate names, a drawing, and ratings for flavor and cost. Only professional references available to butchers are more comprehensive.  The chapter organization based on cut (ground, steak, etc.) rather than the usual type of meat (lamb, beef, pork, veal) is a good educational tool: it emphasizes proper preparation technique rather than animal type.  Some recipes have been successfully re-engineered (mock Cassoulet; Beef Wellington, halleluiah), while others (osso buco, pot au feu) are no better than the ones I got from Joy of Cooking.<br /><br />Although this book is indispensable to everyone but vegetarians, there is plenty to criticize and much room for improvement.<br /><br />1) The authors have bland, Yankee taste buds (Cook's Illustrated facilities are located in New England). Many of the dishes are boring and insipid, and their renovations amount to little more than cutting back on spices and flavors (steak au poivre and pan-based wine reduction sauces to name just two disappointments).<br /><br />2) The procedures seem to be rather fussy; I doubt that their version of blanquette de veau is any better than the one I have prepared successfully several times in a number of different circumstances (Professional Cooking, Gisslen).<br /><br />3) The book suffers from side-bar mania: putting important information in little asides in random places in the text where you will never find them if you try to look them up.<br /><br />4) There is the problem with names: they vary greatly depending on which part of the country you are in, and this issue is never addressed (ask a butcher in California for a spencer steak or shell steak and you will get a blank stare unless he is an old-timer).<br /><br />5) The chapter organization by type of cut and preparation method (e.g. stew, chops outdoors, skewers, etc.) is intellectually more satisfying than a traditional one based on meat type (beef, veal, pork, lamb), but is more difficult to use. If you come home from the supermarket with some meat you got on sale, you will have to thumb through several different chapters to find relevant recipes.<br /><br />6) The catalog of meat types would have been more useful if it also included tenderness, preferred preparation method, and recommended best recipes.<br /><br />7) There are a few cases of sloppy editing (dried fig ingredient in a lamb dish disappeared halfway through the recipe; title confusion of Au Jus versus Yorkshire Pudding; skillets that magically become roasting pans ; not telling whether accumulated oil should be drained or used in the next step; the page reference on p. 347 should be \\"350\\", not \\"35\\"; p. 384 has \\"see page 000\\").<br /><br />8) The home made tonkatsu sauce (Japanese pork cutlet) is a terrible, grade school imitation of the real stuff.<br /><br />9) One sidebar suggests a dangerous procedure: picking up an electric wok by the handle with one hand and scraping out ingredients with the other hand (woks, electric or otherwise, should never be picked up with one hand, even those with western style stick handles). To remove ingredients from a wok, use one of those funny, shovel shaped wok spatulas.<br /><br />10) The recipes tend to be long and fussy. Working your way through multiple steps can be frustrating.<br /><br />11) A \\"time to execute\\" for each recipe would have been useful for beginners, as some recipes take many hours (or even days) to execute from beginning to end.<br /><br />12) Some of the recipes are diffcult and for seasoned carnivores only. A difficulty rating would have been useful.<br /><br />13) Even though a plurality of recipes require a grill, the authors never cover which one to get (also for gas grill recipes). It is clear that the recipe procedures assume that you have a Weber kettle grill; the recipes make no sense for some other commonly available grills.<br /><br />It has chapers on: steak (grilled and indoors), kabobs, chops (grilled and indoors), cutlets, stir fry, stew, pot roast, roast (grilled and indoors), chili, barbecue, burgers, cured pork, and sauces.The home made tonkatsu sauce (Japanese pork cutlet) is a terrible, grade school imitation of the real stuff.  <br />9) One sidebar suggests a dangerous procedure: picking up an electric wok by the handle with one hand and scraping out ingredients with the other hand (woks, electric or otherwise, should never be picked up with one hand, even those with western style stick handles).

US	50042615	R20HXMCEJX9ZM0	0137833822	743232978	The Roux Brothers on Patisserie: Pastries and Desserts from 3 Star Master Chefs	Books	3	28	29	N	Y	The Amateur Pastry Chef	Three decades ago, the Roux Brothers re-invented French cuisine by inventing nouvelle cuisine and writing a cookbook by the same name. With this book, they have focused their talent to the pastry kitchen. One the whole, if you sort of know your way around the home pastry kitchen, this book is a decent (but not great) resource for professional patisserie recipes adapted for the home kitchen. It is not for beginners.<br /><br />In spite of all the French heritage, the Roux brothers exercise their craft in England, and are thoroughly British in attitude and taste, for better or worse. True to this tradition, virtually every dessert in this book has either fresh fruit or marzipan (there is even a Christmas pudding; there are 5 fruit souffles, but not a chocolate one); if you are looking for a standard, heavy, fattening French pastry or dessert that does not have fresh fruit, you probably will not find it here. In that sense, this pastry book is quite deficient, as there are whole classes of pastry and desserts that the home pastry chef should be able to do, but are absent from this book.<br /><br />The concept of a pastry book to train the home cook into an amateur pastry chef is very appealing; this is the stated intention of the authors. No book I have ever come across does this adequately. Sad to say, this book is no exception.  The patisserie here is more or less professional, meaning that most of the dishes are multiple component assembly jobs; it assumes you already have the components available and ready for use. The coordination of making the basic components with the main dish assembly is never addressed. There is a surprising amount of inattention to the recipes by the authors: flour amounts are in cups and not weight, the use of confectioner's sugar makes the dessert gritty (you should use superfine sugar), potato starch in the sponge biscuit, a creme mousseline that uses pure butter rather than whipped cream (yuck), and the use of instant vanilla pudding and lack of gelatin in creme chiboust.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the recipe instructions lack the necessary detail for the home cook.  Without professional instruction, it is unlikely that the average home cook will be able to successfully execute the recipes, even in the basics chapter.  For example, the suggestion to place water directly to the oven floor when baking bread will either cause a kitchen fire or damage the oven. The authors never address what to do with leftover cake trimmings, frostings, etc; several recipes advise you to throw away leftover meringue (a professional pastry chef should know better; just pipe out and bake little cookies or vacherins). Some of the recipes require you to slice genoise rounds into paper thin layers (1/4 inch), but the book never tells you how. The seasonality of fresh fruits is also never addressed (good quality fresh fruits means that many of the desserts can only be made during certain times of the year, plus the quality of fruit in England is inferior to the ones in California, as England is at the same latitude with Canada, not exactly famous for high quality summer berries or stone fruit; if the authors lived in California, I think the fruit treatment would be vastly different).<br /><br />On the good side, other than the croquembouche or Pithivier, the recipes do not have fancy, elegant, professional decorating components. The emphasis is on preparing the pastry itself, making it a good learning tool for the home amateur pastry chef who does not need to learn sophisticated decorating techniques. The recipes also have essential constituents: prep and cooking times, and necessary equipment and tools.<br /><br />The chapter on sugar work (poured, spun, rock, blown, and pulled) is rarely found, even in professional pastry books. They are quite instructive, but flawed: no safety information (hot, molten sugar at 300 degrees is the most dangerous thing in the kitchen, even more dangerous than deep fry grease, because the sugar sticks to your skin, whereas oil tends to drip off or can be shaken off), glucose (which cannot be found in stores, but you may substitute light corn syrup), and the call for beet sugar or cane sugar cubes (wrong on both counts: always use granulated cane sugar for worked sugar and sculpture).<br /><br />It has chapters on doughs, bread, meringue and sponge cake bases, sauces and creams, tarts, cold dishes, hot dishes, sherbet, savory hors d'oeuvres, petits fours, picnic cakes, worked sugar, and a brief chapter on culinary sculpture (dry choux, marzipan, royal icing, pastillage, nougatine, chocolate curls, ice bowl)., because the sugar sticks to your skin, whereas oil tends to drip off or can be shaken off), glucose (which cannot be found in stores, but you may substitute light corn syrup), and the call for beet sugar or cane sugar cubes (wrong on both counts: always use granulated cane sugar for worked sugar and sculpture). <br /> <br />It has chapters on doughs, bread, meringue and sponge cake bases, sauces and creams, tarts, cold dishes, hot dishes, sherbet, savory hors d'oeuvres, petits fours, picnic cakes, worked sugar, and a brief chapter on culinary sculpture (dry choux, marzipan, royal icing, pastillage, nougatine, chocolate curls, ice bowl).  <br />	2004-12-29

If you are the average home cook, the only possible use for this book I can think of is under a table leg to level out the dining room table.  If you are a rookie pastry chef working the dessert station of a restaurant or caterer, then this book is for you. Almost all of the recipes can be prepared and presented as is in a high-level pastry shop or upscale restaurant dessert cart.  For the most part, the presentations are traditional, but there is a fair amount of neo-classical treatments as well.  The food styling is often more instructive than the recipes, and illustrates the importance of the correct plate, even if you must have it custom made by a ceramic factory for that dessert.<br /><br />Each 2-page spread is devoted to one recipe. It has a large picture of the finished pastry (very commendable), ingredients, and a chatty mini-essay about that pastry or the chef.  The bottom of each left-hand page in small type has the chef's name. Please note that the recipe instructions are virtually non-existent: they are the sort of brief, terse directions an executive pastry chef would give to an experienced prep cook or sous chef.<br /><br />The most exciting feature of this book is that all of the recipes are from European master pastry chefs who are the sort of people you would travel to Europe for just for the opportunity for a brief (unpaid) internship.  This book is a rare opportunity to learn from the unchallenged masters of patisserie.  There are number of very clever decorating tricks guaranteed to make even the most jaded patron exclaim: \\"how did they do that?\\" These are pastries that would be a stunning addition to any pastry case or restaurant dessert cart.  Some recipes are for entire cakes, others are for individual dessert portions.<br /><br />Many recipes reflect the European fondness for marzipan (which I personally do not care for and try to avoid if at all possible).  The recipes are rated for difficulty, but I find that even the easy ones are not that simple to do (this complaint applies to the chapter on basics as well).  There are a few odd things: the picture for Brittle Sponge Ring seems to be using roasted almonds and not brittle; the Sachertorte presentation; a fig newton recipe (for pears and not figs) that seems to have way too much spice, etc. The recipes also lack yield information; this is not a problem when you make one cake, but others yield multiple servings of cookies and the like, and the only way to tell how many pieces you will get is by doing the recipe.  Keep in mind that this is European patisserie / konditerei, and some ingredients reflect this: candied strawberry and angelica, creme fraiche, gelatin sheets, and the \\"whipping cream\\" in the text is called manufacturing cream on this side of the Atlantic (although you could probably get away with heavy cream).  It uses the term \\"sponge cake\\" to describe meringue discs. Many of the hints and suggestions are rather elliptical. Most of the decorating and finishing touches require professional level skill.  The food styling in the pictures is usually not explained. The mini pictures at the bottom of the page sometimes do not match the instructions. The pan size and sometimes baking times are not specified. The recipes are assembly jobs and assume the availability of a complete professional array of pre-made components (creams, sponges, biscuit, etc.). The recipes only give the English translation for the names, which makes it difficult to cross reference the recipes against another cookbook that uses the names in the original European language. It is often difficult to tell what type of chocolate is called for; sometimes couveture is obviously implied, but is not called for as such.  There are a number of fascinating biscuit, sponges, and creams that are easily adaptable to your own creations.<br /><br />The organization of this book is virtually non-existent, as is the table of contents. There is no listing of either the recipes or chefs in the table of contents or chapter headings.  The book is organized alphabetically by the chef's last name: Adolf Anderson , Franz Augustin, Eric Baumann, Maurice and Jean-Jacques Bernachon, Christian Cottard, Lucas Devriese, Philippe Guignard, Pierre Herme, Helmut Lengauer, Michael Nadell, Christian Hihoul, Flavio Perbellini, Bernard Proot and Gunther Van Essche, Francisco Torreblanca, and Basic Recipes.

If you are already a decent bread baker and wish to be a great one, this book is absolutely essential; for the rest of us, forget it. If you have worked in a boulangerie washing pans and weighing out flour and wish to become a journeyman bread baker, or a home baker who knows what a direct method bread is and can make one without a recipe, this book is a must have.  It will show you techniques, methods, and philosophies that will make a great bread maker out of a mediocre one.  In spite of the faulty instructions, I had no trouble with the breads I tried, and found the recipes to be reliable, even when baking something for the first time.  If you already know your way around the bread kitchen and want to take the next step, this book is one of the few I know of that will get you there.<br /><br />This book is a collection of the bread making techniques the author has learned over the years from small, artisanal boulangerie in France.  The author has made the serious mistake of assuming that since these artisanal bakeries make small batches using no fancy or modern equipment, that the home bread baker can duplicate them; nothing could be farther from the truth.  Most of the recipes in the book require experience and judgment to properly execute.<br /><br />The main value of this book is as a repository of recipes and methods for high quality and flavorful breads as practiced by hard working bakers laboring away in small, neighborhood boulageries.  It is a good antidote to the fluffy, flavorless mass-produced breads you will find in supermarkets both in this country and France.  Many bakers have become famous using the recipes in this book, and only a small portion of the recipes have been commercially exploited; in this, there is much potential.  Astonishingly, there is a collection of 4 dozen professional, ready to use commercial baking recipes; these are valuable recipes collected from some very famous and very successful boulangeries in France.  In fact, most of the recipes in the first part of the book are scaled down versions of these professional bread recipes, which the author has adapted with varying success.  Even here, however, the author has erred by not making the ingredient tables consistent; a few are in baker's percentage, but not all, the english and metric amounts are not always equivalent (something the author could easily have fixed by spending a few minutes with a calculator; as is, you have figure it yourself and scribble the correct numbers in the page margins).<br /><br />One significant problem is that the author starts throwing around important terms, like levain, sourdough, starter, sponge, or poolish, without explaining the meaning of the various terms; indeed, in some cases the author uses these terms incorrectly.  An experienced baker will be able to know the difference, but not the typical home cook trying to make bread.  The author also commits the ultimate baking sin: measuring flour in cups and not weight, even worse not telling you how that flour is measure.  A cup of flour can weigh anything from 3 to 5 ounces, depending on how you measure it.  The difference is between great bread and an awful disaster.

Even here, however, the author has erred by not making the ingredient tables consistent; a few are in baker's percentage, but not all, the english and metric amounts are not always equivalent (something the author could easily have fixed by spending a few minutes with a calculator; as is, you have figure it yourself and scribble the correct numbers in the page margins).  <br /> <br />One significant problem is that the author starts throwing around important terms, like levain, sourdough, starter, sponge, or poolish, without explaining the meaning of the various terms; indeed, in some cases the author uses these terms incorrectly.  An experienced baker will be able to know the difference, but not the typical home cook trying to make bread.  The author also commits the ultimate baking sin: measuring flour in cups and not weight, even worse not telling you how that flour is measure.  A cup of flour can weigh anything from 3 to 5 ounces, depending on how you measure it.  The difference is between great bread and an awful disaster.

This is not one of those \\"throw it together and toss it into the oven\\" sort of baking book; for these, look up Betty Crocker. The bread recipes in this book are rather long and designed as complete lessons to teach you how to properly make bread.  It is a valuable educational tool, and not a happy-go-lucky affair.<br /><br />The author of this wonderful book has personally perfected all of the bread recipes, and has even taught them to culinary and baking students in professional programs.  Many currently popular baking books, despite a well respected reputation and big name on the cover, are \\"authored\\" by someone whose only experience with bread baking is tossing in a loaf made by a prep cook into a hot oven (and then leaving it to a sous chef to actually watch the bread and take it out of the oven when it is done) or who does not seem to actually like bread, but uses it as a springboard for creativity.  Most of these books are full of inaccurate recipes lacking in necessary detail that will never produce a decent loaf of bread; this book is a happy exception.<br /><br />Baking bread is not difficult, but it does require planning (in some cases, several days ahead of time), plus the home bread baker has to pay attention to what he is doing.  This book will show you how; it is one of the few I have seen that teaches the home baker how to properly make a loaf from beginning to end.  The recipes are thorough, complete, leave nothing out, and very reliable.  This is one of the only non-professional bread books I know of that produces whole grain loaves that are edible.  Trying to come up with a workable bread recipe at home is actually more difficult than in a professional bakery that already has a collection of tried and true recipes; more than once, this book has helped in solving problems I encountered trying to bake bread at home and that never come up in a production kitchen. It also finally reveals the secret to rye bread that will not chip a tooth: coarse rye flour (all bread books I have seen say to use the finest grind rye you can find).<br /><br />This book is one of the few that describes the \\"window pane\\" test, the only way to really tell when bread dough is properly kneaded; \\"knead until smooth and satiny\\" is not an adequate instruction for an inexperienced bread baker, yet this is what most bread books will tell you. The recipes themselves are laid out like class projects that you would give to a beginning student at a cooking school, meaning that with a little effort and dedication, a relatively inexperienced baker will have success with the recipes.<br /><br />One problem is the lay out of the chapters.  The 2 most difficult bread types, French bread and sourdough, are the first 2 chapters, while the easiest ones (and ones that the neophyte should try first) on multi grain breads and quick breads are further back in the book.  The author should have either organized the book's chapters in increasing order of difficulty, or given a recommended chapter order in the introductory material.  Also helpful would have been a listing in the recipes as to how long that recipe takes, as some must be started several days in advance.  The baking of flatbreads is also a mystery: he recommends placing, watching, flipping, and docking them.  Problem is, they only take a minute or two to bake; if you are doing these things, the temperature of the oven drops dramatically each time you open the door, and the brief baking times do not permit the temperature to recover.  So, even though you set the oven to 500 degrees, it could be 350 or less by the time you leave the oven door open to manipulate the dough.<br /><br />Note that all recipes have a professionalformat: ingredient amounts are listed in both volume and weight measurements, there is a table of baker's percentages, and the steps are strictly numbered.  The recipes are complete, meaning that few have less than a dozen steps, and several occupy multiple pages.  Most recipes are accompanied by extensive notes.  The first chapter is one the author rightfully expects you to read and thoroughly understand before doing any of the recipes in the rest of the book, as it contains vital information you will need. I should also say that this exemplary information is important for bread baking in general, and applies to all other loaves you might try, no matter which baking book you are using. The 2 recipes for French bread alone are worth the price of admission. Note that he has complete, tested recipes for poolish, biga, old dough, and barm.<br /><br />It has these chapters: basics, pre-ferments, sourdough, whole grain, rye, enriched, flatbreads, quick breads, and winning recipes from the bread Olympics.

Any baking book full of southern recipes is promising, but this one is disappointing and nothing more than another, run-of-the-mill baking book, although it is a rather interesting collection of recipe clippings.  The author's intention seems to be that of capturing the state of southern baking before disappearing before a tidal wave of supermarket breads and nation-wide coffee chain stores; he makes a good but not entirely successful run at it.  It is a fascinating collection of ideas, principles, and anecdotes, but prospective home bakers searching for old fashioned, simple, hearty, and fool proof recipes will be disappointed.  There is plenty of sizzle (a potentially valuable collection of old fashioned baking recipes), but little steak (solid, good, reliable recipes along with many helpful hints that you will want to do).<br /><br />For the most part, this baking book is a collection of recipe clippings scotch-taped together in one book.  The recipes range from 200 year old cookbooks to modern-day, womens' magazines, with the latter predominating; mostly, the recipes are cribs from other baking books.  It would not be unfair to accuse the author of not really testing many of the recipes; some are anecdotal stories rather than modern recipe instructions as such.  It takes an experienced baker to sift through the chaff in this book to find the few precious gems; they do exist, but you will have to hunt for them.  The recipes specify cups rather than weight for flour, and the instructions are very informal, so this book is not that easy to bake from.<br /><br />It has chapters on: corn, biscuits, waffles, yeast, British, whole grain, candy, fruit, frozen, custards, cookies, petit fours, pies, and cakes.	2004-12-07

Having a complete assembly of recipes in one book is a great convenience.  Normally, I have to flip through a number of cookbooks to get the quick bread I want, since each one has only a few such recipes.  The recipes themselves, however, are pretty standard, and you probably already many similar recipes in the baking books you have on your bookshelf.  I do recommend this one, but only because of the convenience of having all the quick bread recipes in one place. The main advantage is that when you are looking for a very good quick bread recipe, you only have to search through this book, rather than having a pile of a dozen or so baking books on your desk.<br /><br />All of the recipes in the cornbread chapter have flour, rather than the genuine article that does not have flour. The muffin chapter was pretty pitiful, as was the coffee cakes. The pancake chapter would be more useful if the author described the character of the particular pancake (light and fluffy, thick and rich, thin and rubbery-in the good sense, spidery and lacy, etc.) rather than regale you with anecdotal stories.  There are several rare and valuable crepe recipes, but the recipes for the fillings are below average.  A significant minority of the recipes seems to be nothing more than manuscript padding; I am not convinced that the author actually tested all of the recipes (viz: the ones that add cooked rice, since they were either gritty or lumpy; the recipes for microwave fruit jam were laughable, not to mention dangerous).  Most of the waffle recipes are the wierd ones requiring egg whites beaten to soft peaks. The author has also picked up the bad habit of adding whole grains and/or dried fruit to just about everything for a healthy and nutritious treat (derived from either \\"Recipe/Diet for a Small Planet\\", the worst cookbooks ever, or else British baking books).<br /><br />The last chapter is a reasonably useful compendium of ingredients, techniques, and equipment.  Some sort of table of contents of this chapter would have been useful.  The sections on eggs, salt, sugar and oil are predominantly wrong.

This is a breath of fresh air, as a majority of recipes in bread books do not work as written.  Note that all of the recipes use manual kneading for the dough; there is a brief, generic explanation on how to convert all recipes to either bread machine, food processor, or stand mixer.  All of the recipes I tried worked as advertised, which is unusual for a baking book, although I did note a tendency for the kneaded breads to be under-proofed and under-baked.  The most successful ones came from the quick breads and sweet breads chapters.<br /><br />I object to some of the statements on wheat flour, but the subsequent section  on equipment is very good.  There are some odd things in that section: a Peggy Tub (I was afraid to try it), and an unusual procedure for making dough on a stand mixer (since I do not own one, I could not test it). The chapter on yeast bread basics is exemplary; it is one of the few explanations that are sufficiently detailed for a beginner.  The statement that sourdough tastes better near the ocean is factually wrong; San Francisco sourdough is now known to be a specific variety of yeast that is being successfully cultivated in many places, coastal and otherwise.  It is not always necessary to let water sit for 24 hours to allow the chlorine chemical taste to dissipate; my municipality uses a chlorine compound that has no taste or odor, moreover does not disappear if you let it sit.  The instructions for sourdough starter were simple and practical, however: not enough basic sourdoughs, too many odd-ball variations that you will never do, many (especially the fruit filled roulades) did not rise and were underbaked, many doughs will not double in bulk during proof.<br /><br />The first part has yeast breads: white, whole wheat, whole grain, pizza, and sweet.  Here, I had the most success with the sweet breads; there are a number of interesting loaf forming techniques.  The second part is about sourdough: starters, breads, quick breads, and a short chapter on levain (which, strictly speaking is not sourdough, but even professional books will lump the two together).  The third part is on quick breads, which has some very good recipes, including some very nice cornbreads that have neither flour nor sugar; my only complaint here is the relative brevity of these parts.  The last two chapters are brief, but the most useful in the whole book: home bread failures and their causes, and a large collection of washes and glazes for breads.<br /><br />The description for braiding a three-strand loaf is incorrect.  The rest times listed are too short: dough that has toughened should be rested for 20 minutes, not 5; puff pastry needs to rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours, not 30 minutes.  Several recipes involve rolling out dough to large sizes, and others rolling out very long (30 inches plus) ropes, yet instructions for these are not given in the book; this is not easy, and requires patience and practice.  This is one of the few non-professional bread books that list correct, final internal temperature, even warning you which breads cannot be judged with a thermometer.  However, I find the breads are usually under-baked; I usually had to increase oven temperature 25 - 50 degrees, and baking time 5 - 10 minutes.  I found that many of the lean doughs needed an internal temperature of 210, not 200 as specified by the author.  It also uses the unusual dough make-up technique of starting with all the liquid, then adding flour a little at a time.  This is a good way for the beginner not to add to much flour during kneading, but also produces sticky doughs that are hard for beginners to handle.<br /><br />There is, however, one glaring error: all of the recipes list only cup measures for the flour.  In the introductory section, the author does specify spoon-and-sweep method for measuring flour, and further specifies that her cup of flour is 4 ounces, more or less.  Flour weights should be listed for each recipe, as this gets the home baker in the good habit of weighing ingredients accurately, rather than adding some of this and some of that, and \\"baking by feel\\".  Not weighing ingredients, particularly the flour, is the greatest source of failure for the home baker.  You do indeed need to develop the skill of \\"baking by feel\\", but only experienced bakers can do this; a neophyte in a home kitchen does not have this sort of skill or experience.uring flour, and further specifies that her cup of flour is 4 ounces, more or less.

Note that this book has both yeasted and non-yeasted varieties.<br /><br />There are some things that are very good. The explanation for making bread in a home kitchen for the beginner is one of the better ones I have seen: it is thoroughly and simply laid out.  Many of the flatbreads were rather problematic, and either tasted like cardboard or were hard to form and roll out; plus, some of the recipes do not give a clear indication of when the baking time is done. The non-bread recipes are the authentic peasant dishes that come from market places, food stalls, street vendors, and homes in third world countries, rather than the Michelin-rated hotel in the capitol city of that country.  As such, the Asian chapters constitute one of the best oriental food cookbooks I have seen in recent years.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is much here to criticize.  For every bread recipe, there are at least two (and often more) non-bread recipes that are suppose to be served with that bread. In some chapters, the bread recipes are hard to find.  Many of the recipes are inedible herbed chutneys or salsas. Some of the tools and ingredients are hard to get, even in a large city with a substantial ethnic population, and there is often no equivalent listed.  Some of the dough make-up techniques are not easy and require practice.  The authors have only done a fair job translating the peasant recipes for the Amercan kitchen.<br /><br />Basically, this book is a fascinating account of Eurasian travel by the authors, eating and baking their way through several foreign countries.  Their passion and dedication to their subject come through every page. There are many interesting accounts of eating flatbreads in different and diverse cultures. It is a reasonably valuable collection of hard to find flatbread recipes.

It is very chatty and friendly, which many will appreciate, especially with a subject as forbidding as making your own bread in your own kitchen baked in your own oven.  On the other hand, this bread book, like many others, is disappointingly short on bread making advice and proper procedures.  Overall, I was more impressed with the quantity than with the quality of the recipes.<br /><br />Many bread books contain identical oven temperature and cooking times for all the bread recipes, even though the breads themselves vary far and wide.  This is a sure clue that the author has not actually successfully made and baked all of the bread recipes, but only did a few prototypes and invented many bread recipes at the word processor.  This is one of the few bread books I have seen where all the breads have vastly different oven temperatures and baking times, telling me that the author actually tested and tweaked all of the recipes, not just a select few.  This is even more impressive because of the wide variety of different breads contained in this book.<br /><br />On the negative side, this book is more prominent for what it does not have.  Instructions on how to tell when something is properly kneaded, fully risen, or how to form a loaf is notably absent.  Also shameful is the lack of accurate measure of flour: the author uses cups, does not give weight equivalents for the flour amounts, and never specifies how the flour is measured (dip and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.).  Most troubling are the generally lax and incomplete recipe instructions; if you have not done them before, there may not be enough detail in some of the recipes.<br /><br />The chapters on whole grains produces its share of heavy and inedible bricks suitable only for constructing a wall; healthy and nourishing indeed.  On the other hand, I produced many fine loaves of bread, although the quick breads were better than the yeast leavened ones.  It also has several rare and valuable recipes for doughnuts and its cousins.<br /><br />Some of the recipes call for unusual things such as: flour mill, ceramic baking bell, and ingredients that are impossible to find (even in a large, well stocked market in a major city).<br /><br />It has chapters on the following bread types: history, basics, white, whole grains, rye, wierd flavors, rolls, sweet, quick, muffins, fried, steamed, griddle, flat, funny shapes, en croute, and holiday.also has several rare and valuable recipes for doughnuts and its cousins.<br /><br />Some of the recipes call for unusual things such as: flour mill, ceramic baking bell, and ingredients that are impossible to find (even in a large, well stocked market in a major city).<br /><br />It has chapters on the following bread types: history, basics, white, whole grains, rye, wierd flavors, rolls, sweet, quick, muffins, fried, steamed, griddle, flat, funny shapes, en croute, and holiday.	2004-11-16

My main objection is the over use of whole grains, as they produce textures that are course, dry, and heavy.  If you are interested in whole-grain breads, this book is a treasure trove of hard to find recipes. I was more impressed with the quantity than the quality of the bread recipes.  Some worked better than others, but I was not overly crazy about any of the breads I made from this book.<br /><br />There is a serious problem with the measurement of flour.  It calls for stir and scoop method of flour measurement.  The appendix lists the weight of one cup of flour as 5 ounces; when I did it, I got exactly 4 ounces.  So, I am unsure exactly how much flour to use in the recipes, and weighing the flour (the usual professional solution) is of no help here.  Plus, the author prefers wet doughs with a high hydration level (a method popularized by Poilane, who appears in the introduction of the book); this does produce lighter, airier bread, but it is significantly more difficult for the beginner to do than a dough with a standard hydration.  If you do want to try these recipes, I suggest you use more flour (try 20% to begin with) than listed to get a firmer dough; kneading will be much easier.  It is also unclear what the author means by \\"unbleached white flour\\": is it all-purpose flour or bread flour? Based on the ingredient balance in the whole grains chapter, I am assuming it is the latter.  I used bread flour throughout, but still often got dense, under-developed doughs that will not window-pane correctly, telling me that the author might have been using a special, high gluten wheat flour.  In order for the whole wheat bread recipes to work, you must use whole wheat bread flour, even though the author does not specify as such.  I would also ignore the author's instructions to add flour to the liquid a little at a time; for a beginner, it would be better to simply use all the flour and liquid at once in the beginning. Many recipes have instructions for both hand kneading and mixer.<br /><br />The first chapter has a fairly good primer on the various aspects of bread: dough, risings, baking, etc. The main failing here is the author does a poor job of describing when a dough has been properly proofed.  Too often, the author gives a time specification (which will probably not be correct, depending on how warm the weather is) along with the standard \\"until doubled\\" (with an oval or round loaf, how are you supposed to determine this? Just by looking at it?).<br /><br />The chapter on whole grain breads produced heavy, dense, inedible loaves suitable only as construction material. Most of the recipes call for 3 risings, but some of them will not rise the third time.  It often also calls for mixing in only part of the flour, fermenting that, then adding the rest of the flour; there was no apparent advantage to just adding all the flour at once (in fact, the author's 2 part mixing was more trouble and more time consuming with no apparent advantage).  The British must have more tolerance for eating wood than Americans; from this intriguing chapter, I found only the Baps to be edible. The recipes for Indian breads were very good.<br /><br />The chapter on sourdough gets applause for a good try, but it has too many questions to be recommendable.  Sourdough does not \\"spread out quickly\\" when turned out of a banneton.  I also object to the suggestion that levain or doughs be left out at room temperature for 12 hours or more.  This might be OK in Britain where it is cool, but in the U.S., especially in summer, the yeast will die off if you do because it is too warm; after a few hours at a warm room temperature, they should be put in the refrigerator overnight.  Only one recipe, Pain de Campagne, uses only sourdough levain; all the others use commercial yeast in addition.  This is a good convenience, but you will not get much sourdough taste if you do, and the author does not have conversion instructions if you do want use all levain.  Also, the doughs call for far too much whole grains; I find that at most you can add 10% whole grains to a sourdough before you get something like a boat anchor (it seems that I can use kamut and spelt up to 20%).  On the good side, the recipes seem to be based on actual experience rather than myth and rumor about sourdough (which is more common in baking books than you might suspect).  She also has instructions, albeit brief ones, for both sourdough levain and Italian biga.<br /><br />The chapters on savory and sweet breads were mostly recreations of the sort of breads you get at a traditional English high tea.  The rather light breads you would normally expect from these chapters used far too much rye, whole wheat, durum, etc.  \\"Fruit-Filled Bread\\" is described as \\"pleasantly heavy\\" (come again?).  The chapter on crackers had several valuable recipes, although I had to increase the baking temperature to get the correct, crunchy texture.  I had difficulty getting anything edible from the 2 chapters on quick breads, although there where several good scone recipes.

There is little here that you will not find in any all-purpose baking or cookbook.  There are a handful of breads that are truly outstanding, but these are few and far between.<br /><br />I like the variety of recipes: the types of bread represented were well chosen.  I also like the detailed instructions; many recipes have more than a dozen steps.<br /><br />The first chapter on corn bread has several recipes that use whipped, soft-peak egg whites, a very unnecessary ingredient for those who genuinely like corn bread.  This chapter also calls for some unusual baking pan sizes, some of which do not exist even in a professional kitchen.  The chapter on quick breads was especially disappointing, as most of the recipes use dried fruits and those that do not will use fresh fruit (I admit to having a pathological hatred of quick breads with dried fruit, so I mostly ignored this chapter).  I mostly liked the whole-grain bread chapter, although the doughs were uniformly dry, and I had to add more water than specified in all the recipes I tried.  The flatbread chapter was pretty disappointing, as there were only 4 recipes (flatbread, cracker, foccacia, breadsticks) with many flavor variations presented as separate recipes.  I liked the selection of flavors in the country bread chapter; the recipes are very detailed.  There are a few sourdough recipes, but I find it difficult to get a decent sourdough starter using just commercial yeast.  Here, the author ferments the dough overnight for flavor, then adds fresh yeast to get the dough to leaven.  There is also a chapter of miscellaneous breads, with some bad flavors (rhubarb) and some really good ones (orange sticky buns).  The last chapter has some useful recipes for flavored honeys and spreads.<br /><br />This book commits the ultimate baking sin: the weight of flour is never specified, and the method of flour measurement (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.) is never specified.  Based on the heavy textures using spoon-and-sweep, I suspect that the author uses sift-into-the-measuring-cup technique (a little over 3 ounces).<br /><br />Many of the ingredients called for are hard to get, even if you live in the south-west in a major city full of ethnic and gourmet markets, and the author does a poor job of specifying substitutes.  At one point, the author advocates the use of un-pasteurized buttermilk (a big no-no, at least from a legal standpoint).  There are some scattered instructions for bread machines, but no models or brands are specified.  Another problem is that basic information for dealing with dough is buried at the end of the book, where you are likely to overlook it.  For a bread book, the information on kneading and forming dough is surprisingly skimpy; in fact, it is completely inadequate for the beginning bread baker.  The suggestion to cover dough with plastic wrap is a problem, as the dough always seems to stick to the plastic and deflates the dough when you try to pull it off; I just cover it with an over-turned, empty box.  A listing of the recipes either in the table of contents or at the chapter headings is lacking.p, etc.) is never specified.  Based on the heavy textures using spoon-and-sweep, I suspect that the author uses sift-into-the-measuring-cup technique (a little over 3 ounces). <br /> <br />Many of the ingredients called for are hard to get, even if you live in the south-west in a major city full of ethnic and gourmet markets, and the author does a poor job of specifying substitutes.  At one point, the author advocates the use of un-pasteurized buttermilk (a big no-no, at least from a legal standpoint).  There are some scattered instructions for bread machines, but no models or brands are specified.  Another problem is that basic information for dealing with dough is buried at the end of the book, where you are likely to overlook it.

I liked the sausage making recipes, but was not very impressed with the sausage cooking section.<br /><br />This book is really 2 different books in one, so I will describe them separately.  The first part, which is the first 100 pages, is full of wonderful, useful, and very rare recipes for making fresh or cured sausages.  The second part is 200 pages is a pretty standard collection of recipes that use sausages, which I am less enthusiastic about.<br /><br />The first 20 pages of the sausage making section supplies information for making and curing sausages.  The rest of the section has individual recipes for many different types of sausages.  It has sections on: country style, southern, german / east european, southwest, mediterranean, asian, game, and seafood.  You quickly learn that despite their variety, sausages are really just ground meat with many seasonings (getting the texture just right and fighting with the meat grinder is a different story).  The only difficulty with this part is the necessity of a meat grinder; in most cases, you cannot use a food processor.  The other problem is getting the sausages casings; you can just make them in bulk (which is how I usually use them, as I am too lazy to go through the trouble of stuffing them into casings), or go to a local, old fashion meat butcher and get them there.<br /><br />The recipe section is a little less interesting.  It has: breakfast, appetizers, soup, sandwich, pasta, grains, seafood, poultry, meat, and sides.  The quality of the recipes is OK, but not exceptional (sort of like the recipes in those magazines in the check-out lines at the grocery store).  The recipe section is a moderately useful section, since you can use store bought varieties of sausages. The problem here is that the recipes are arranged in standard fashion; organizing according to the sausage they use would have been more helpful.  That way, if you have some sausage sitting in the refrigerator or freezer, it would be easier to find a recipe that uses them.<br /><br />Some of the page references are wrong.have been more helpful.

This book is one of the few truly helpful books that actually shows you how to properly bake a cake. Many baking books feature a famous chef on the cover, along with casual recipe instructions and the admonition that this really is easy to do; usually, this is a lie.  This book fills in all the details, and is really the only cake cook book you will need.<br /><br />Please note that this is not a \\"throw it together and bake\\" kind of cookbook; for these, I suggest books like The Fannie Farmer Baking Book, or Pillsbury's Best of the Bake-Off.  The chapters are arranged like a textbook. The author expects you to systematically bake your way through each chapter in order, gaining skill and experience with each chapter.  You are not suppose to skip around at random, picking out a few appealing recipes.  The first chapter has pound cakes, the easiest; last chapter has European tortes and gateaux, the most difficult.<br /><br />It has chapters on ingredients, equipment, techniques, pound cakes, butter cakes, coffee / streusel cakes, cakes with fruit, sponge cakes, roulades, chiffon, angel food, american, cheesecakes, tortes and gateaux, filling, frosting, glazes, sauces and toppings, and decorations.<br /><br />The quality of the cakes are very high. When I need a high caliber Sacher Torte in a professional setting, the recipe comes from this book.  It has a rare and complete recipe for Genoise.  It is also one of the few books that insists on clarified butter for the Genoise (the only other one I can think of is Beranbaum's Cake Bible).  The only real complaint I have is the suggestion to bang Genoise batter in the cake pan on the counter just before baking (never do this; better a couple of small holes in the finished cake than a deflated cake).  Her recipe for chiffon cakes produces more loft than conventional procedures.  I also wish the author would use the classic European names for the recipe titles; it would make looking up certain patissiere classics easier. The last section tells you how to match frostings and fillings to the cake, some valuable and hard to find recipes for glazes, and a definitive recipe for creme anglaise.  There is also information on substituting different baking pans, and a sufficient amount of information about cake decorating for the home baker.<br /><br />The most vexing feature of this book is the format of the first part, which has critical information on tools, pantry, and techniques.  This is a most important collection of information that is essential for baking, but is usually left out of most baking books.  The bad part is that these three chapters do not have a listing of the subjects; if you need to find something, say how to fold an egg foam batter, you will have to leaf through the entire chapter to find it.  All other chapters have a complete listing of recipes in the Table of Contents.<br /><br />One can disagree with the author on a few points: unbleached flour does not have a higher protein content than all-purpose (this is brand dependent), the silly notion of melting chocolate in a 225 degree oven, and not supplying the flour measurements in weight as well as volume (she describes sift, spoon, and sweep, which is about 3 1/2 oz when I tried it).  I also dislike her idea to dump out excess flour when flouring a cake into the sink; since flour tends to clog drains, I do it over a garbage can.  The section on suggested equipment is comprehensive: 30 different cake pans are listed, about a dozen categorized as essential, and 50 different tools, about half categorized as essential.  The pantry chapter has a good dissertation on the important ingredients and what to do with them.  The chapter on techniques gives complete instructions for all of the important baking tasks, such as how to handle butter and fats, beating eggs, folding batters, lining baking pans, bain-marie, telling when cakes are done baking (it differs greatly depending on cake type), de-panning cakes, storage, and a fascinating section on freezing.  The metric conversion table for liquids in the Appendix is wrong.g when cakes are done baking (it differs greatly depending on cake type), de-panning cakes, storage, and a fascinating section on freezing.

US	50042615	REIYLK7UA04WA	060960838X	64041425	Pillsbury: Best of the Bake-Off Cookbook: 50th Anniversary Edition	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A Winning Cookbook (almost) of Winning Recipes	The best part of this cook book is that the recipes were not created by culinary professionals or famous chefs.  The cooks were ordinary people creating put-together recipes requiring no special talents, abilities, or ingredients.  On the other hand, some of the recipes make one cringe just by reading them; since they are all contest winners, perhaps they taste better than they seem to appear in print. On the whole, however, it is a collection of (mostly) very good and easy to do recipes for the home baker. This book is a glossy affair full of color photos; it is a shame that the person responsible for the format did not also think of arranging the recipes within each chapter, or supplying a list of recipes for each chapter.<br /><br />The Pillsbury Flour company has been sponsoring a famous baking and cooking competition for many decades, and this book is a compilation of some of the very best of the winners.  Some baking classics came from this contest: French Silk Pie, Tunnel of Fudge, Thumbprint Cookies, Upside Down Cake. The ingenuity and thoughfullness of the amateur cooks often out-shine their professional counterparts, of course they tend to do things like use instant mashed potato flakes (do they still make them? I have not seen them since I was a teenager) and canned vegetables.  Many recipes include the ingenious use of store-bought components, like canned biscuit dough, cake mixes, and instant puddings; the flavors were often quite good. I tried some of the more odd recipes, but did not have any problems with any of the recipes, although I was not always happy with the flavor or texture.  Most of the recipes were very easy to do, and none required special or sophisticated skills, which is the most valuable part of this cookbook.  One interesting factor is that despite the fact that each recipe was by a different person, all recipes seem to have been standardized on one, consistent flour measurement (spoon and sweep).<br /><br />The first three chapters (appetizers, main dishes, side dishes) were the least inspiring; I do not think I did more than a couple of recipes out of these parts.  The chapter on breads was rather ordinary, but the one for sweet rolls and coffee cakes was quite good.  The cookies were OK. The cakes were extraordinary, the pies were OK.  The last chapter was a hotch-potch of recipes that did not fit anywhere else.<br /><br />In summary, this is a valuable cook book to have on your book shelf for those occassions when you have many hungry people at your table and you just need to throw together something decent, or you just do not have the time or inclination to do anything else.apters (appetizers, main dishes, side dishes) were the least inspiring; I do not think I did more than a couple of recipes out of these parts.

The few recipes I tried produced flavors that did not work for me, so personally this book was a bust.  On the other hand, this book is a treasure laden resource for chile-heads, or fans of Chile Pepper magazine.  The authors of this book are also editors of Chile Pepper magazine.  So, if you are a subsriber to this periodical, you will certainly want this book.<br /><br />The quality of the recipes, however, left something to be desired.  First, the recipes themselves were sort of generic.  They seemed to be ordinary recipes that someone had added some chile peppers onto, and then proclaimed as something special.  They certainly were not; the recipes themselves, minus the heat, are ordinary ones you can find in almost any magazine that has recipes or in a inexpensive paperback cookbook.  On the other hand, they are typical of the ones you will find in the aformentioned periodical.<br /><br />Second, and more problematically, the recipe procedures were too informal to be truly useful or reliable.  Most recipes, even the complicated involved ones, were casually tossed off in a few sentences.  None of them had the detail or information necessary for proper execution.<br /><br />Only chapters on fruits and drinks had any culinary merit.  The flavors of combining fresh, sweet fruits is trendy these days in Latin-American communities, but without much historical merit.  It is a food I have had a few times at festivals, and have never liked.  Also, adding chile heat to various drinks is important and certainly worthy of attention.<br /><br />One important problem with this book is the variety of unusual chiles required by ingredient lists.  Some of them are extremely rare outside of Mexico, and I was unable to obtain many of them, even though I live near several large latino communities with well stock grocery stores with native latino ingredients.  There is no guide to chiles in general, although this information is easily had from Dave DeWitt, Mark Miller, Ten Speed Press, et al.  Also lacking is a substitution guide for the chiles, when you cannot find the ones listed in the recipes but still want to try the recipe.  I had to do so some subtitution, but based on my own rather incomplete understanding of the subject of chile varieties.<br /><br />It has the following chapters: candies, cookies, puddings, bread, jam, cakes, pies, fruit, drinks,  and ice cream.hough this information is easily had from Dave DeWitt, Mark Miller, Ten Speed Press, et al.

There are some good points; in the end, however, it turns out to be a decent, if undistinguished, dessert book.  This book is especially valuable for those who are fans of the author's eateries.<br /><br />All of the popular, wonderful items at Payard's patisserie on the East Coast have been adapted for the home kitchen.  Gone are the multiple component creations that take several days to execute at home, as are the sophisticated decorative touches that take talent and look like Picasso or Dali on a bad day.  There are few components to do (e.g. only one pie crust recipe, rather than the dozen or so you will find in competing books), and all that is left is the wonderful taste.  This, at any rate, is the stated intention of the author.  Problem is, the recipes themselves are things you can find in almost any all purpose cook book, and there is little reason to pick this one over a cook book you might already have on your bookshelf.  It is true, however, that all of the finicky bits are missing and procedures for the most part are not that difficult to do, and do not require any special skills.<br /><br />The first part is a good step.  It lists delineates tools, techniques, and basic recipes (genoise, simple syrup, buttercream, apricot glaze, etc.) that are crucial, but are often relegated as boring stuff tossed in at the end of many cook books.  This book, happily, lists weights as well as volume measures for both liquid and dry ingredients, the mark of a good cook book author (thank you, chef).  However, it has several lapses.  It does not describe the proper procedure to beat egg whites, fold batter, or tell you what a batter that \\"ribbons\\" means.  For ingredients:  he specifies grade AA large, but does not indicate that the size (\\"large\\") and not the grade is important (AAA, AA, A, and even B will work as long as the egg size is correct);  Armagnac is specified, but substitutes for those who cannot get or afford it are not specified (in fact, any decent quality brandy will do; I use California ones and usually get better flavors than with Armagnac), and a similar remark applies to his choice of chocolate (whenever a cookbook specifies Callebaut, I substitute Hershey's Special Dark, and always get identical results).<br /><br />The Fruit Soup chapter is like Mexican agua fresca with Asian flavors (lemongrass, ginger, and five spice powder).  Note that the Cookie chapter is about classic French cookies (tuiles, sables, macaroons, etc.), and not American ones.  The Cake chapters were uninteresting, but the tarts were pretty good (especially the Lemon, and also the individual Tartes Tatin). In the Souffle chapter, half of them were frozen souffles (really just frozen mousse).  I cannot tell you about the ice cream chapter, since I do not have an ice cream machine or a freezer cold enough to make granite.  The last two chapters on Holiday stuff and Candy have some decent recipes.  A listing of all recipes in the table of contents or chapter heads would be an improvement.stitutes for those who cannot get or afford it are not specified (in fact, any decent quality brandy will do; I use California ones and usually get better flavors than with Armagnac), and a similar remark applies to his choice of chocolate (whenever a cookbook specifies Callebaut, I substitute Hershey's Special Dark, and always get identical results).<br /><br />The Fruit Soup chapter is like Mexican agua fresca with Asian flavors (lemongrass, ginger, and five spice powder).

It is, judging from the BBC publishing imprimatur, an adjutant to a British TV series.  According to the publishing data, the recipes are from the magazine Good Food and its vegetarian sibling.<br /><br />The recipes are brief, and lacking in useful detail.  The average home cook will be able to execute the recipes only with significant difficulty.  Some of the recipes are complicated, multiple part efforts, yet they the procedures are always casually tossed off in a few sentences.  It appears that the instructions were edited down so that each recipe occupies the same editorial space on a page.  It was difficult to take the recipes seriously; they are more useful as entertainment.  More surprisingly, few of the recipes were very appealing.<br /><br />The food styling is exemplary.  The large, glossy photos are immensely appealing, and almost every recipe has a matching picture.  It makes a fine coffee table book, but a lousy cookbook.  The organization leaves something to be desired; the chapter \\"Hot Stuff\\" is a dumping ground for recipes that do not fit in any other chapter, not to mention all those god-awful steamed puddings. I recommend it mainly for fans of the Good Cook magazine and/or British desserts (recipes for pancakes not withstanding).	2004-09-15

Beranbaum is a thorough and careful cookbook author.  The result is the most useful chocolate cook book that I own.  It is a very productive resource for chocolate recipes.  Whenever I need a recipe for, say, a chocolate version of Gateau St. Honore or L'Opera, this is book I go to first, and it is the chocolate book I bake from most frequently.  A word of warning, however: the recipes are not necessarily easy to do, and the uninitiated might have some difficulty following the more involved recipes.<br /><br />This book is a mostly traditional collection of classic, French patissierie.  You will find things like buche de noel, caraque, mille-feuille, succes, madeleines, profiteroles, macarons, rochers, mousse, nougats, trois-freres, and truffles. The chapter on basics is probably the most valuable chapter: it has all the basics, such as genoise, pate feuilletee, croissant, pate a choux, pate sucree. pate brisee, succes, meringue, ganache, creme patissiere, and creme chantilly.  Beranbaum has done an excellent job of adapting these recipes for the American kitchen.  All the ingredients are listed in both volume and weight measures.  The procedures are thorough, complete, and reliable.<br /><br />I do have a few objections.  There are some easy recipes, viz Brownies or Viennese Hot Chocolate, but most are rather advanced and not for the casual home cook.  Some kind of difficulty rating system would have been a great help.  The chocolate pound cake recipe is the wacky one that uses egg whites beaten to stiff peaks, not a real pound cake by my standards.  Several recipes use a chocolate coating, but proper instructions for tempering chocolate is not supplied anywhere in the book; for these recipes, I suggest you ignore the author's statements about heating and cooling chocolate and resort to a chocolate cook book that has full instructions for tempering.<br /><br />It has these chapters: cakes; little cakes and cookies; desserts; confections; beverages; kitchen basics; decorations.rs: cakes; little cakes and cookies; desserts; confections; beverages; kitchen basics; decorations.   <br />	2004-09-14

I give it a very low mark because the title is deceiving and extremely dishonest; chocolate lovers will find slim pickings.  In general, I was more impressed with the quantity rather than the quality of the recipes; I would recommend it mainly for fans of British desserts. In spite of the tremendous number of recipes, there are not that many truly useful recipes. The caliber of the recipes was aimed at the average home cook.  Even so, one must be careful in choosing recipes, since they are of variable quality.  Note that this book was written in Britain, so you have to work your way through things like superfine sugar, palm sugar, whole wheat self-rising flour, Set honey, gelozone, Quark, Ogen melons, elderflower cordial, fruit malt loaf, caster sugar, curd cheese, chopped suet, no-soak dried apricots, ready-to-eat dried apricots, fruits of the forest, dessert apples, smetana, light muscovado sugar, and canned cream rice.  The subtitle is \\"From Around the World\\", but all of the recipes are certifiably British.<br /><br />The format of the book was outstanding.  Each recipe has its own page, meaning that this weighty tome has more than 1000 pages.  Each recipe has a difficulty rating (I disagree with many of them, but at least it has them), execution times, and a picture.  The pages are glossy, 4 color affairs.  The table of contents is barely there, which is a significant failing in a book where some of the chapters are more than 200 pages long.  The index is of no help either, as it is not properly cross referenced, and only lists the full recipe names.  One good point, however, is that the photos appear to be genuine attempts to execute the recipes; some have mistakes that probably should have be re-done (the Pithiviers and Creme Brulee are burned; the pictures for Chocolate Shortcake Towers and Tiramisu Layers have an odd, greenish tinge; the meringue for Satsuma & Pecan Pavlova is broken).<br /><br />In the cookie chapter, a substantial portion of the recipes contain oats.  The cake chapter for the most part reflects British fondness for adding fruit (juice, dried, fresh, canned, jam, marmalade) and/or spices (often in excessive amounts) to baked cakes.  Typical recipe: Eggless Sponge (\\"This is a healthy, but still absolutely delicious, variation of the classic sponge layer cake and is suitable for vegans\\"). This chapter has a few dozen recipes for fruitcake and its cousins.  The chapter on Crepes, Loaves, and Pastries is over-laden with fruit-stuffed crepes, fruit-stuffed tea breads, and fruit-stuffed tarts (not to mention the cheesecakes made with tofu).  It is especially useless unless you are serving an English High Tea, and virtually devoid of chocolate to boot.  The Hot Desserts chapter is mainly for aficionados of fried, boiled, grilled (how many fruit kabob recipes do you really need, anyway?), or baked fruit (yuck; what is wrong with just eating fresh fruit?), and is also devoid of chocolate (from this chapter I conclude that the quality of British fruit is frighteningly low; I live in California, where the fruit quality is some of the best in the world; good quality fruit does not need cooking). This chapter also features a full panoply of rice and British puddings (double yuck), and disappointingly few souffles; the editor could learn a thing or two about fruit crumbles from American cookbooks.  The quality of the recipes in the chapter on Cold Desserts is appallingly low and features several trifles; it is also devoid of chocolate.  Confusingly, some recipes from this chapter are not served cold out of the refrigerator or freezer, but to be served \\"cold\\" at room temperature after cooling off, as opposed to hot out of the oven.  The last chapter on confectionery and beverages is the best of the lot.<br /><br />The results were variable.  Some worked perfectly, whereas inothers the liquid/flour balance was clearly off.  There is no indication as to what measuring method was used for the flour, nor are equivalent weights listed.  The instructions to the recipes were a mixed lot: some were OK, while others were clearly wrong.  There did not seem to be much testing of the recipes.  In general, the instructions were brief and not very helpful.  The recipe for Pains au Chocolate is laughably short (similar comment applies to the Pithiviers recipe).

So, the publication of his chocolate recipes was a very big deal in his native country.  This book translates these famous recipes for the American kitchen.  Unfortunately, these are more suited to the professional kitchen rather than the home one.  Statements in the preface not withstanding, this book is definitely for the veteran home pastry chef or professional.  They will find a wealth of sophisticated and well regarded desserts.  The procedures have been adapted very well for the home kitchen, and the recipes themselves are very well explained.  However, the average person messing around in his kitchen at home will find very few recipes that are within his abilities.<br /><br />For the professional, this book is a treasure trove of valuable recipes.  There are very few recipes that would not be at home on the dessert menu of an upscale restaurant or a classy pastry shop.  All of the components are explained and the appropriate procedure described far enough that any veteran can execute them; in this respect, it is unusually clear and detailed.  There are recipes for such famous desserts as Gateau St. Honore and The Concorde.  The instructions are thorough and very clear.  For these situations, this book is a must have.  Of special merit, especially for the amateur pastry chef, is the last chapter on foundation recipes. Here, you will find unusually complete and thorough descriptions for such things as puff pastry, ganache, pate sucree, creme anglaise, and creme chantilly.  The problem here is that the traditional french names are not used, for example \\"deep chocolate cream\\" instead of chocolate creme anglaise.  Also of value is a brief glossary at the back of the book where it is easily overlooked.<br /><br />For the home cook, however, the situation is entirely different.  Most of the important fill in details on how to do something specific is missing; the author assumes that you already have the appropriate skill.  There are a few recipes suitable for the home cook, but they are few and far between (by my count, less than 10% of the recipes).  The majority of the recipes are multi-component affairs that take planning and skill to execute properly.<br /><br />All recipe ingredients are listed in both volume and weight measurements.  A heavy duty stand mixer is required.  All recipes have storage instructions.  Note that Pierre Herme is not the author; the recipes are his, but the ancillary material and explanations are the work of Greenspan, the co-author; in this respect, the book is not as valuable as it might have been.<br /><br />It has the following chapters:  cakes, cookies, tarts, desserts, candy, frozen, drinks, basic recipes.u already have the appropriate skill.

The only ones I had trouble with were the ice creams, since I do not have an ice cream machine.  One can quibble here and there (chocolate mousse without gelatin; some of the candies were terrible), but the overall quality of the recipes is very high.  Each recipe has a list of equipment that is required, and also a note as to where the stopping points are.<br /><br />It has the following chapters, each with about a dozen recipes: cakes; small cakes, crepes, and pastries; cookies and candies; pies, tarts, and cheesecakes; souffles, brulees, pots de cremes, and other creamy desserts; frozen desserts; fillings and sauces.<br /><br />On the negative side, there are a surprising large number of deficiencies.  A large stand mixer and food processor are required; there are no alternate instructions for manual mixing and preparation.  Some of the recipes are simple, while others require a fair amount of skill; some sort of rating system would be helpful for the home cook.  The food styling in the photos often do not match the decorating instructions in the recipes, such as a Gateau St. Honore pastry tip used to decorate the photo of the Meringue Napoleon.  Many recipes require whipping egg whites or folding, yet there are no detailed instructions for the home cook as to how to do these things.  About half of the recipes are lax when specifying when something is finished baking or properly whipped; the cooking instructions for sauces in the last chapter are particularly large offenders in this area.  The chapter on cakes seems to imply that regular and non-stick cake pans are interchangeable; they are not, since the oven temperature and baking times will change.  It would also be nice to know what brands of chocolate were used in developing the recipes.  Information about flour measurement, egg size, and cocoa type is in a small section buried at the back of the book that is easily overlooked (where you will also find a very good list of equipment needed to do the recipes in the book).  Also absent is information on how to cut the various baked goods: serrated knife, French chef knife, wet knife, dry and hot knife, angel food knife, etc.; the cooking instructions for sauces in the last chapter are particularly large offenders in this area.

Here is where one will find shortbread, pancakes, biscuits, devils' food cake, apple pie, and muffins.  I use it more often than the rest of my baking books put together.  If there is only one baking book on your bookshelf, this is one to have.  The author understands what the average home baker is and is not capable of.  She also seems to understand that the best recipes are those that have the fewest ingredients. All things considered, it is the baking book I recommend the most often. I find it to be reliable and useful.<br /><br />In recent years, there has been a plethora of snazzy dessert books.  They have beautiful, glossy pages, top notch food styling, a famous name, and a smiling face on the cover.  Problem is that the recipes are, at heart, ordinary recipes; they also feature sophisticated techniques and skillful decorations. Worse, they are often poorly edited, and many have not gone through a test kitchen. If you are a professional or advanced amateur pastry chef, they are a treasure trove; for the rest of us, they are useless.  The Fanny Farmer Baking Book is entirely different: you will find several hundred classic, easy to do recipes that will become regulars in your home kitchen for years.  I was impressed by both the quantity and quality of the recipes.<br /><br />My main problem with this book is the poor organization.  Some of the chapters are 150 pages long, but the table of contents merely lists the chapter title, and there is no other detail.  The Pie chapter, for example, has the following sections: Types, Crusts and Toppings, Cooling and Storage, Freezing, Ingredients, Equipment, Dough, Rolling and Shaping, Storing, Basic Master Recipe, more than two dozen crusts and doughs, puff pastry, Toppings, and recipes for pies with: fresh fruit, preserved fruit,  deep dish, classics, sweet cheese, cream, chiffon, custard, breakfast, translucent custard, candy, mincemeat, turnovers, dumplings, not to mention a whole section devoted to tarts.  Yet, by looking at the scanty table of contents, you would never know this.  Likewise the cake chapter: it is thoughtfully organized by cake type, but you would never know this by looking at either the table of contents or chapter head. More than once I have found myself puzzling over the confusing index, and then having to flip through more than 100 pages of text to get the information or recipe I need.  Each chapter starts with a master recipe that explains all the tools and steps in excruciating detail that takes several pages; all the of the rest of the recipes in the chapter use that master recipe as the basic technique.  Of course, you will never find them unless you take the time and patience to physically leaf through the whole chapter.  The last part of the bread chapter features several detailed, reliable recipes for puff pastry and danish.<br /><br />It has the following chapters: General Information, Pies and Tarts, Cookies, Cakes, Yeast Bread, Quick Bread, Crackers.<br /><br />There are a few losers (Curry Refrigerator Cookies, Rosewater-Almond Pound Cake, Linzer Torte where the jam is like leather, a one bowl Lemon Pudding Cake that requires two bowls; chocolate cakes using cocoa powder that do not taste all that chocolaty). I object to the name of this otherwise wonderful book.  Fannie Farmer never wrote a baking book, and her name does not belong in the title.  The author is wrong about her Danish recipe being better than a commercial bakery, and also about storing Irish Soda Bread for 8 hours before eating.

Specifically, it is a productive resource for the professional or the veteran amateur pastry chef.  The recipes are probably too ambitious and the instructions too vague for the average home cook.<br /><br />The introductory chapter is a mixed bag. The essays on types of chocolate, tempering, and tools are exemplary. On the other hand, the sections on non-chocolate ingredients and various techniques and procedures (such as whipping egg whites or proper batter folding technique) are virtually absent.  It also has the obligatory and disposable information on chocolate history and manufacturing.<br /><br />Interestingly, the book has three main sections, one each for milk, dark, and white chocolates.  Here, you will find recipes mainly for cakes, cookies, and confections.  In a rare moment of honesty, the authors admit that milk chocolate has such a weak chocolate flavor that it is easily overwhelmed in a recipe.  There are slightly more than 50 recipes, and they are all listed and cross referenced in the table of contents.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are problematic. The main error here is the listing of ingredients in volume (e.g. cups) with no equivalents given in weight. This is a major problem for professionals who will try to multiply the recipes, and also for any recipe that has flour.  They all list prep times, but never the cooling or baking times. Many of the recipes are complicated affairs that have several components. The result is a recipe that takes up several pages, but even so the instructions are quite scant; they are sufficient for professionals, but not detailed enough for the inexperienced. There is no advice on how to coordinate the execution of a complex recipe with several different sub-recipes. Each recipe has a picture, which is a good thing, but the presentation and decorating instructions in the recipes sometimes do not match the food styling in the photos.  These problems will not be a hindrance for the experienced, but will be major trouble for the average home cook.<br /><br />The most interesting feature of this book is the variety of truffle recipes.  Each one has detailed instructions from A to Z for using the fancy, plastic truffle molds that can be bought on the internet in a bewildering array of different types and shapes.  There is also a recipe for using chocolate transfer sheets.ing, but the presentation and decorating instructions in the recipes sometimes do not match the food styling in the photos.

Well, set down your lantern and rest your weary bones, because you have finally found it. Nancy Silverton became famous for the sourdough bread that she makes at her bakery, and this book will tell you in excruciating detail how she does it.<br /><br />Few things are as wonderful as good sourdough, and few things are as elusive as sourdough recipes in bread books. Few will even acknowledge the presence of sourdough; fewer still will mention words like levain, chef, starter, or poolish. The number of baking books that will give you real recipes for them can be counted on one hand.<br /><br />This book is a complete tutorial on sourdough bread from start to finish. The first recipe in the book for a basic white bread takes an astonishing 30 pages: 10 to tell you how to make your own starter, and another 20 to tell you how to make the dough and bake it. The author is a stickler for detail; the thoroughness in the recipes can be irritating. It also means that your chances of success are very high; all of the breads I tried worked perfectly, even the more difficult ones based on rye. Each recipe has a rather long (and very complete) list of equipment that you will need (including, in one case, a room thermometer). No longer is sourdough dependent on random chance, magic, or even experience.<br /><br />Be warned, however, that sourdough is not easy to do. You will end up throwing away a \\"swimming pool\\" of dough in order to refresh the starter. Some of the fermentation steps are 12 hours long. Some breads have to be refrigerated overnight, so you will need room in your refrigerator for several bannetons and/or sheet pans.<br /><br />There are also some surprising gaps. During kneading steps, there are not always clear instructions on how to tell when you are done; this is especially true of the slack doughs that she expects you to do in a machine rather than by hand. All you get is an instruction to knead for a certain number of minutes. The baking instructions are not always helpful in telling you when the bread is baked enough; all you get is a vague description and a certain number of minutes to bake. Sometimes she tells you what color to look for. Other times, she gives you a description of what the inside of the bread should look like, but this is of no help if you have the oven door open and are wondering if the bread is done baking.<br /><br />The title of the book is also a problem. It is not obvious from the title (unless you have actually been to her bakery) that the book has sourdough recipes almost exclusively. Conversely, the unwary buyer might pick up this book expecting an all around collection of boulangerie recipes.<br /><br />Of special merit is the final chapter with recipes using the starter you would normally just toss out. This is the only book I know of that will tell you what to do with this excess starter when you are not going to be making bread. There are recipes like onion rings and pancakes that work quite well.you to do in a machine rather than by hand. All you get is an instruction to knead for a certain number of minutes.

It was one of the earliest (1978) bestselling cookbooks about just chocolate.  Most cookbook authors and culinary professionals either have it or know about it. I find this chocolate book rather over-rated, but it is nevertheless a good resource for chocolate recipes to have on your bookshelf.<br /><br />The recipes are an impressive collection from far and wide, and this is reflected in the vastly different recipe instructions.  The author seems to have left the procedures largely intact from the original source, other than to supply the details you might have trouble with.  I suspect that some of the recipes did not work originally, and the author then had to \\"fix\\" them. In the end, I had no trouble with any of the recipes I tried, even the wacky ones I thought would not work (such as a cake that uses whipped cream instead of whipped egg whites). The author has a good feel for what the average home cook is capable of, and most people should not have much trouble with any of the recipes.<br /><br />The tremendous variety of recipes is this book's strongest suit. It is a scrap book full of truly good recipes from many people and places, many of them professionals and/or famous cooks.  It has sections on cakes, cookies, pastry, desserts, and other (confections, sauces, decorations, drinks, reprints).<br /><br />The author commits the ultimate baking cookbook sin: not specifying how the flour is measured, nor supplying the equivalent weights.  The author merely says \\"fill\\" a measuring cup with flour and level, but it is not clear if this is \\"scoop and sweep\\" or \\"spoon as sweep\\". I used spoon and sweep (a la Julia Child), and this seemed to give the correct results.  The ingredient lists specify sifted flour, and instructions also specify sifting; it is not clear if the author wants the flour sifted twice (once for measurement and another for mixing the flour with other dry ingredients) or just the once listed in the recipe. If the sifting is during measurement, it is also not clear if this suppose to occur before or after measuring.<br /><br />Besides flour measurement, it is also lax in other aspects. Varying egg sizes are treated as more or less interchangeable (they are not).  Reliable and detailed instructions on how to tell when things are done baking are notably absent. There are no detailed instructions on how to do the 2 things used in virtually every recipe: creaming butter and sugar, or beating egg yolk and sugar to a ribbon stage. The temperature of eggs or butter is usually not specified.  A majority of the recipes specify decoration or frosting, but the instructions for them are not supplied. There is a chatty essay about the varieties of chocolate, but the author does not give firm recommendations as to specific brands; she merely lists the commercial brands available at the time, although some recipes do list brands.  There is no advice on the proper method of cutting flourless cakes that are notably sticky or moist. In the introductory chapter, there are detailed procedures for folding batters and melting chocolate, subjects that are usually absent from baking books.  However, there is not a similar dissertation for whipping egg whites; the brief instructions contained within the recipes are not sufficient.  On the bright side, this book has instructions for making pie dough that are complete, detailed, and reliable, quite a rarity these days.ipe.

If you can find a copy, it is a good thing to have if you are a casual home baker who makes the occasional chocolate treat at home in your kitchen.<br /><br />A rarity among baking and chocolate cookbooks, all of the recipes seem to have been thoroughly tested by the author.  This assures a reasonable chance of success for even the casual home cook. I had no trouble with the unconventional recipes I picked out for testing. Some of the recipes are clearly the author's own, for example, several separated egg foam cakes that still call for baking powder; clearly a recipe you will not find in the CIA baking book.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are significant problems. The book copyright is 1983, so many recipes you would expect to find are absent, and there many recipes that are so awful by today's standards that you would never try them (viz. a fake fudge recipe that uses unbaked, raw oatmeal flakes).  The brief introductory material on types of chocolates and how to handle them is useless. The author also commits the ultimate baking cookbook sin: specifying flour in cups, not specifying the equivalent weight, and not telling you how she measures her flour (I used scoop and sweep, and it seemed to work correctly except in a couple of recipes).  I also noted that some of the more difficult recipes were deficient in detail, but such instances are far fewer than in most contemporary baking books.<br /><br />In summary, a good chocolate book that deserves a place on your chocolate bookshelf, with the caveats mentioned above.	2004-08-06

In the introductory material, he festoons the reader with stories of working in Europe with the finest confectioners and chocolatiers; unfortunately, this experience does not seem to be reflected in the recipes of this rather ordinary book on chocolate. In the end, I suggest that you forget this book and instead pick up one of the many fine chocolate cookbooks put out by Hershey's.<br /><br />The first dozen or so pages cover equipment, chocolate, ingredients, tempering, etc.  It is brief, declamatory, and useless. The instructions for Buche de Noel were extensive, imprecise, and confusing.  Some of the cake assembly requires professional techniques, none of which is explained.  I laughed when the author expects people to have an oven big enough to accommodate 4 cookie sheets at the same time (in the recipe for his recreation of LeNotre's Concorde Cake). Molded cakes are no easy matter, and the instructions in this book are woefully inadequate. For Rigotorte, the author casually tosses off the recipe for a chocolate pate sucree in 3 sentences; properly treated, this basic but not easy recipe should take 3 pages. The instructions for tempering chocolate are sufficient only for someone who has done it before.  The last chapter has several worthwhile showpieces (suitable only for those with some experience), but it could use a few more pictures.<br /><br />The most basic recipe in the book, genoise, is the oddball version that uses a substantial amount of cornstarch; it does work, but is inferior to the standard version using all flour.  A good genoise should also use butter which his does not, but he gets a pass; on the other hand, the recipe gives rather fuzzy directions for how long to beat the batter.  The other basic cake, chocolate sponge, uses the separated egg sponge method, but also atypically has cornstarch. Inexplicably, the angel food cake uses self rising flour, which has baking powder; the main reason to make angel food cake is to avoid the use of chemical leaveners.<br /><br />The physical construction of the book is like a college textbook: heavy duty and durable with thick, glossy pages.  The graphics and design are exemplary.  The beginning of each chapter has a list of all recipes, a welcome convenience; strangely, the page numbers are not listed, so you still have to do some page flipping to find anything. It has: basics, cakes, cookies, custards, frozen, pies, candy, drinks, and decorations.  The chapters on cakes, pies, and cookies were disappointing; the ones on frozen desserts and candy were very good. The chocolate decorations were very interesting, but the instructions were not sufficiently detailed for the novice.<br /><br />On the good side, the author is always careful to specify what type of cocoa powder to use, and all recipes have storage specifications. On the bad side, the flour amounts do not have weight equivalents, and the temperature of the eggs is never specified. Overall, I was more impressed with the quantity rather than the quality of the recipes.n reason to make angel food cake is to avoid the use of chemical leaveners.  <br /> <br />The physical construction of the book is like a college textbook: heavy duty and durable with thick, glossy pages.

As far as the book's author is concerned, there are only 2: leavened with egg foams (separated egg or whole egg), and leavened with chemicals (baking soda and/or baking powder).  This book contains only those using eggs as the leavening agent (save for one: devil's food cake).  On the good side, I liked the flavor of the cakes due to the lack of chemical leavening; on the down side, the cakes require that you vigorously beat eggs separated into whites and yolks, meaning you will need either a stand mixer or very strong arms. The best feature of this cookbook is that all recipes list weight and volume measurements. Criticisms not withstanding, this unassuming little book can be recommended highly (well, okay, the title is a little presumptuous, not to mention untrue).<br /><br />It has plain (36), fruit and jam (38), nuts (14), liqueur (9), molded (11), and unique (20) recipes for cakes and associated components such as frostings.  There are a few color photos, but these were done by a professional stylist and have nothing to do with the recipes or their instructions and are totally worthless.  The chapter on nut cakes is especially interesting, as almost all the recipes use ground nuts and are flourless.<br /><br />The recipe for simple genoise tells you to fold in flour while drizzling in the melted butter; beats me how one is suppose to do both things at the same time, as no details are given. Most professional recipes say fold in flour then fold in melted butter.  Most of the recipes have a lower level of sugar compared to other cookbooks; this is sometimes, but not always a good thing.  Interestingly, many recipes call for 8 inch cake pans rather than the standard 9 inch ones.  The instructions for splitting cakes are inadequate, especially when the author expects you to split a half sheet pan cake in half horizontally.  The author claims to have invented the cake batter mixing method, and this is largely true: most cakes use an unusual hybrid mixing method (a combination of separated egg sponge and modified creaming method). Once you master this method, virtually all other recipes are done exactly the same way (only a few cakes use whole egg sponge-black forest, pound, citrus, genoise, etc.).  The bavarian creams for the charlottes would be better with creme anglaise rather than pastry cream.  The recipes in the last chapter (unique cakes) are rather too facile and prone to failure.<br /><br />The first third (74 pages out of a total of 239) is devoted exclusively to ingredients, equipment, and techniques.  While it is a useful collage of information borne of several years of professional experience, this section is too brief and declamatory to be of much use to the inexperienced home baker.  It is also randomly assembled and jumbled together, so you have to flip through all 70 pages to find anything; an index or detailed table of contents would be a great help. Although you can take issue with some of the information, it is by and large an excellent source of information for someone who knows his way around the pastry kitchen.  Disappointingly, the description of folding is too brief, and the section on beating egg whites has a lot of advice, but not a specific procedure per se.  The use of stale cake crumbs as an ingredient is good advice, but the recipes that specifically call for them are not indexed or tabulated anywhere; if had these crumbs to use, you would have to leaf through the whole book to find recipes that use them.the author expects you to split a half sheet pan cake in half horizontally.

It contains the usual British sensibilities, along with their renowned lack of attention to detail or accuracy. For example, the pie dough recipes specify butter, but it does not tell you if it is cold butter directly from the refrigerator, butter in its plastic state, or totally softened room temperature butter. In general, I was skeptical of most of the procedures, as they are filled with inventive ideas that probably do not work very well.<br />This book gives 105 recipes: 5 basics and 100 full recipes. It has: basics (5), cold (25), hot (15), cakes (20), petit four (12), cookies (16), drinks and candy (12). The section on cold chocolate recipes is the most interesting, insofar as most chocolate cookbooks have few if any recipes for cold desserts.<br />The first chapter on general chocolate information is full of cheats and shortcuts that the beginner should never use without a thorough understanding of chocolate, which this book does not supply. The comments on various ingredients do not apply to American stores (e.g. for &quot;golden syrup&quot;, substitute light corn syrup; most recipes use self-rising flour). The book also does not specify whether the decorations described need tempered chocolate. &quot;Thin chocolate shapes&quot; do not &quot;go stale quickly&quot;; if properly tempered, they will last as long as a huge, 5# block of chocolate (although they are easier to break).<br />The ice cream chapter suggests, in the absence of an ice cream machine, that you turn your freezer down to its lower setting and freeze the cream mixture while stirring occasionally. Interesting, but the results are not acceptable: it makes something resembling a granita made with milk. On the other hand, I liked the Italian Chocolate Christmas Pudding; it is a 4-to-1 chocolate ganache with cream cheese, big handfuls of cherries (since they were out of season, I substituted an assortment of dried fruit), and then frozen. The baked recipes often do not have good descriptions as to when things are properly baked (&quot;slightly set&quot;, &quot;just set&quot;, &quot;well risen&quot;, etc.). The cakes tended to be dense and gluey, closer to a British baked pudding rather than a proper cake. The directions (especially for the egg white based cake batters) tended to be brief and perfunctory. The baked puddings were nearly inedible. The recipe for puff pastry filled with chocolate is wrong on several counts.<br />The graphic design of the book is very pleasing. Each recipe gets a full page along with several color photos. You also get cooking and prep times. On the other hand, some of the food styling is faulty, e.g. chocolate terrine photographed without the accompanying sauce, and a marbled cheesecake is photographed so you cannot see the marbling on top. Curiously, the photo for Chocolate Coeur a La Creme was not made in the appropriate mold (perhaps the food stylist could not be bothered to make a trip to the cookware store and get the correct pottery). The photo of a crepe being cooked appears to show the fixing of a mistake; either this mistake should be explained or the photo should have been re-done. The marbled coffee cake looks like a mistake. I suggest that the food stylist put down that glass of sherry and pay closer attention to his job.<br />This book commits the ultimate cookbook sin: specifying flour amounts in cups, and not weights; even worse, the author never tells you how the flour is measured. The pie dough recipes worked better with &quot;scoop and sweep&quot; rather than &quot;spoon and sweep&quot;, but the texture was still tough and chewy, and I suspect there is an error in the ingredient amounts (on the other hand, this is par for course as far as home baking books are concerned).<br />Overall, this is a fairly decent collection of recipes, but it is too problematic to recommend. The only thing I truly liked about this book is that it is spiral bound, meaning thatit lies flat on the table when you are doing a recipe from it; the slightly glossy texture of the paper can be quickly wiped clean if you spill something on it.that it lies flat on the table when you are doing a recipe from it; the slightly glossy texture of the paper can be quickly wiped clean if you spill something on it.	2004-07-19
US	50042615	R31OAKOMUKVGG6	0877015414	343350421	Fantasy Chocolate Desserts	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Plated Dessert Master Class	This valuable little book will be of absolutely no help to the average home cook.  To the sophisticated amateur pastry chef or newly formed professional, it provides an invaluable lesson: turning out plated desserts good enough to be served at restaurants.  Here is the art of turning a piece of cake into something a customer will be happy to pay $15 for.<br />The book is divided into 2 sections: the first one has 44 recipes for components, and the second part has 23 complete dessert presentations (however, not all of them are formal plate presentations).  This latter section is extremely valuable.  There are complete instructions for assembling the plate, including all of the decorating details and components; many include variations.  It demonstrates the entire process from beginning to end, and there are few if any books I can think of that show this.  It is probably the equivalent of several professional-caliber classes at a cooking school.<br />The recipes are definitely not for the uninitiated.  The Genoise, for example, is the first cake most professionals learn how to do. The recipe for the chocolate version of this standard is not sufficiently detailed for the beginner to do successfully; many key steps are not sufficiently explained.  For the advanced baker, however, this recipe is more than sufficient; he will know how to fill in the blank spots.  Others, like chocolate mosaic tiles, will require practice even for experienced professionals.<br />The recipes themselves are models of clarity and usefulness. Some have notes where the author answers those questions that are common, viz: pastry cream should never be strained, the proper method of preparing a raspberry sauce, that apricots are the only fruits worth buying canned, and when folding chocolate mousse it is better to live with a few white streaks than to risk deflating the batter.  They also have a complete list of equipment, including those irritating little things that one is always forgetting, such as cooling racks, wax paper, or measuring spoons.  All recipes also have information about storage and keeping.<br />Here is a dirty, little cookbook secret: the beautiful, graphic pictures in most cookbooks on your bookshelf were actually baked, prepared, and photographed by a professional food stylist who may or may not have used the recipes in that cookbook.  So, in most instances, the pictures have nothing to do with the recipes in the book or the author. This book is a happy exception.  The chef author is the stylist, and all the photos are of actual production samples baked by him using the recipes in the book.  This alone qualifies it for the cookbook hall of fame.<br />There is one caveat, however: this book is nearly 15 years old.  In the years since this book was published in 1988, restaurant desserts have moved away from the type of dessert in this book: an architectural structure that could easily qualify for the cover of a crafts magazine.  The author is from the San Francisco area, and most of the restaurants in this area no longer serve this sort of dessert styling.<br />My main complaint is about the ostentatious title: it masks the solid, professional nature of the book.  The table of contents could have been more detailed; since there are not that many recipes, they could have been included in the TOC itself., such as cooling racks, wax paper, or measuring spoons.

US	50042615	R310FDKGAHNZFJ	1580624057	587667152	Everything Chocolate Cookbook (Everything Series)	Books	2	18	21	N	N	The Nothing Chocolate Cookbook	I am not familiar with the &quot;Everything Series&quot;, but after this miserable cookbook, I doubt that I ever will.<br />I disagree with virtually everything in the first two chapters; they cover basics about types of chocolate, tools, and skills.  They are incomplete, misleading, or downright wrong. There is no such thing as &quot;molding chocolate&quot; nor &quot;enrobing chocolate&quot;.  I have dealt commercially with a few chocolate companies in my time, but have never heard of the word &quot;chocolateries&quot;.  The advice on chocolate co-ops, auctions, chocolate tasting parties, and starting your own chocolate business is laughable.  The author also repeats the amateur's misconception that couverture is a higher quality, tastier chocolate; in fact, unless you are using it in molds or for dipping, couverture is unnecessary and probably a waste of money.  In fact, it has a lower viscosity, harder texture, and higher price due to the higher cocoa butter content. There is also no advice on how to shop for the different chocolates for novices who are going to the grocery store to buy them. I would also like to know exactly what brand(s) of chocolate the author used during recipe development.  The instructions for tempering couverture lack one important step: a test to tell when the chocolate is properly tempered, and additional instructions for what to do when it is not correctly tempered or has cooled down and needs retempering.<br />The truffle recipes are actually one basic recipe with many dozens of slight variations, changing the type of chocolate or liqueur/flavoring.  The instructions for truffles are wrong: ganache should never be cooled in the refrigerator in an airtight container.  Truffles that are going to be enrobed or dipped should never be refrigerated at any time for any reason; best advice is to dip them as soon as they are shaped. The author uses ingredients such as &quot;butterscotch liqueur&quot;; a professional knows what this is, but a specific brand name would be a great help to a novice trying to find it at the neighborhood liquor store.  The fudge recipes are based on something that used to be known as &quot;Serviceman's Fudge&quot;, more renown for its ability to survive overseas shipment than for its flavor. The reader gets the impression that the author was trying too hard to come up with a wide panoply of chocolate recipes; fewer, but higher quality recipes would have been preferable.<br />The author also commits the ultimate cookbook sin: not specifying how the flour is measured, nor listing a weight for the flour but only a cup measurement.  However, on page 40 (in the equipment section), the author states that the flour should be sifted before measurement: 1) this method will cause baking recipes to fail in most cookbooks (most use either the scoop-and-sweep or spoon-and-sweep; I know of no baking book, professional or consumer, that specifies sifting before measurement), and 2) the correct method, used in all professional kitchens I have ever worked in, is to measure by weight.  In this case, we do not know if the author sifts directly into a measuring cup, or sifts onto a piece of paper and then pours it into a measuring cup (the difference can easily be 10%), because equivalent weight measures are not given.<br />I am also tired of authors who change the original recipe, yet insist on retaining the title &quot;Nestle Toll House Cookies&quot;.  It also suffers from side-bar-mania: many pages have tips and hints about baking, but these are randomly scattered throughout the text and not indexed, so that you will never find them, even if you look for them.  Many recipes do not have a clear-cut indication as to when baked things are done. Some recipes are more difficult or take several hours; some sort of warning about this would be helpful.  Some, such as croissant or brioche, are missing instructions at crucial steps.<br />The cakes, cookies, libations, and morning treats were OK, but thefrosting, bars, and muffins were hideous. The pie section is forgettable and fraught with untested recipes.  The author should have used the modified creaming method more often in the cake/torte recipes.  The custards and plated desserts were ordinary.  Neophytes will probably not be able to successfully do many of the projects in the decorations chapter.<br />The index is one of the worst I have ever seen in any book.  Not only is it very short and incomplete, any entry with a French accent mark (ague, grave, circumflex) appears as a random symbol, meaning that the book editor was asleep at the switch.<br />There are simply too many problems with this baking book for me to recommend it.  In general, I was appalled by the low quality of the information and recipes.  On the other hand, I found the recipes to be akin to the ones you will find in Pillsbury, Betty Crocker, etc.: easy to do, but mostly uninteresting.  I also found some of the truffle flavor combinations to be pretty good.  It has been said that there is no such thing as a totally worthless chocolate cookbook; in this case, I will make an exception.  I suggest that you leave this book in the discount bin at the bookstore where you found it.but the frosting, bars, and muffins were hideous.

If you already have a few pastry and baking books on your bookshelf, this would be a good, but not a great addition.  You get a dictionary of around 800 definitions, and a few dozen recipes.<br />Note carefully what this book is not.  You will not get a comprehensive encyclopedia full of pictures, diagrams, and recipes for just about everything under the sun, written by a diverse panel of distinguished and world renown pastry chefs.  If you need a picture of something or a specific recipe, you will probably not find it here.<br />What you will get is a quick and handy reference to look up specific words and pastry names and get a brief, dictionary-style definition written by a respected but solitary author.  Most entries are half a dozen sentences.  A few major entries, such as sugar, will barely get a page.  One can nit-pik here and there, but the the information is reasonably objective and level-headed.<br />The recipes are common ones easily found in any standard baking/pastry book, but it is a collection of fairly good recipes.  The ones I tried worked very well.  &quot;Beat&quot; and &quot;blend&quot; are important techniques, yet receive a couple of useless sentences each, and similarly for &quot;fold&quot;.  Certain important, specific procedures and skills, surprising, receive scant attention.  I also object to the cooked sugar chart: her categories are significantly different from standard texts on the subject, making it dangerous to use as a reference for a different cookbook.  She also does not give the standard advice that cooked sugar should always be judged by the thermometer, and not these old-fashioned finger tests (cookbooks that do use these categories in recipes will usually have a chart giving exact temperature equivalents; if not, you need to get a different cookbook).  The definition of Swiss and French meringues is backwards.  Mirliton is also a Cajun word for chayote.  The definition for cornet (paper pastry cone) is missing.Swiss and French meringues is backwards.  Mirliton is also a Cajun word for chayote.

It is also of absolutely no use to the home cook, professional pastry chef, or even confectioner.  So, this book gets the lowest rating possible.<br />This book has achieved something of a legendary reputation; virtually every chocolate cookbook lists this book in a bibliography.  After reading this book, this hard to understand.  It is a college level textbook covering food science, food technology, and industrial manufacturing.  If you are a prospective food technologist, this book is a must have.  For the rest of us, forget it.<br />The book is written with the British chocolate and confectionery industries in mind; this is not a problem except when it comes to the anecdotal stories of manufacturing and retail companies, and such things as ?brown rat? instead of Norway rat.  Some of the chapters (cocoa butter, sugar, confectionery fats, pseudo-chocolate) are very interesting, but, sadly, of little practical value. The book would be a more useful reference if the sub-headings in each chapter were listed; as is, the table of contents lists only the chapter title, which is a problem since some of the chapters are over 100 pages long. Each chapter is a more or less independent monograph on a particular subject.  The main strength of this book is in having so many such monographs all in one place. Some of the more editorial portions of the book tend to be slightly na?ve, such as the chapter on nutrition.  Few companies are large enough to have a staff food chemist, a staff entomologist, and a staff psychologist on the regular payroll.  There are some old, interesting, rare, and valuable out-of-print confectionery books listed in the bibliography in the appendices that are worth hunting for.<br />I did pick a few interesting tidbits, however.  Cream centers that are dipped in chocolate while still warm causes small cracks in the chocolate, and the filling leaks out.  The sugar in Lyle's Golden Syrup is partially inverted, which means that, from a confectionery point of view, it is similar to corn syrup and honey.  The procedure for dissolving egg albumen is soaking for 24 hours in a cool place, and sieving; most procedures call for just soaking for one hour before use.<br />Part 1 is 200 pages, and covers the industrial processing of cocoa beans into cocoa and chocolate.  Part 2 is 300 pages, and has nothing to do with chocolate.  It covers food stuffs other than chocolate that are commonly used in confectionery processes.  The material in this section is easily available from standard texts on food science.  Part 3 is 200 pages and covers pest control, packaging, QC, nutrition, and R&amp;D.  The last 100 pages cover bibliography, index, and some laboratory tests that are peculiar to chocolate.<br />Of particular interest in Part 3 is Chapter 20 which focuses on the physical properties of chocolate. In a short (15 page) but fascinating section, it lists the causes of fat bloom: poor tempering, cooling too fast and covering cold centers, butter and milk fats in the centers of chocolate coated candy, warm storage temperatures, fats not compatible with cocoa butter mixed into the chocolate, and finger prints.  This section then goes on to review several articles on bloom, and concludes that the causes are subject to debate and disagreement.  It also has a rare and brief (2 page) section on sugar bloom, which I have never seen.  The rest of this chapter covers material with no particular practical relevance.s partially inverted, which means that, from a confectionery point of view, it is similar to corn syrup and honey.

Unless you are a culinary professional (and are able to sort the nonsensical statements from the more or less accurate ones) or an Australian, you should avoid this book.<br />A FUNNY LANGUAGE-The English used in this book is British/Australian rather than American, so many of the words and phrases (such as &quot;fold through&quot;) used do not bear the same meaning here in the U.S.  For example, it has &quot;All-In Method&quot; or &quot;One-Stage Method&quot; without mentioning the common American term: high ratio method, nor does the author mention that its raison d'être is that it uses inexpensive vegetable shortening instead of butter.  &quot;Boiled Sweets&quot; is taffy, and &quot;prover&quot; is proof box.  It has &quot;lier&quot; instead of &quot;liaison&quot;, and I have never heard of macadamia nuts referred to as &quot;Queensland nuts&quot;. He will also have to explain to me the difference between an oval-shaped pastry and one that is &quot;oblong&quot;, and whether the latter refers to rectangular, as oblong can mean both.  In several instances, I had to consult my OED (Oxford English Dictionary) to understand some of the author's statements.<br />BAD ADVICE-I object to a substantial amount of the cooking instructions as being either questionable or just flat wrong.  For example, cutting puff pastry with a hot knife is the worst thing you can do.  Following the recipes verbatim will probably cause the casual cook to fail at many of the recipes, whereas professionals would know better.  Proper amaretti do not use flour, and certainly do not need to sit for &quot;6-8 hours&quot; before baking.  The definition of baking soda is wrong, and, of more importance to the amateur cook reading the book, is used incorrectly throughout the text.  He often calls for icing or powdered sugar, which is not available in the US. The closest thing we have is what he calls &quot;non-lumping&quot; sugar, or confectioner's sugar, which has a small amount of cornstarch mixed in; in these cases, substitute superfine sugar.  For bienenstitch, the author states that the base dough is unsweetened, yet his recipe uses 3 tablespoons of sugar for the dough.  The taffy recipe calls for the partially cooked sugar syrup to be stored for 24 hours, and then cooked to completion in a clean pot; this procedure is unnecessary.  The procedure for making croissants is so brief, that only someone who has done it before will be able to properly execute the instructions.  He also does not mention the advantage of cr&egrave;me pâtissi&egrave;re over custard: it can be safely baked as a part of a pastry, whereas most custards would break.  He is also rather deficient when it comes describing when something is properly baked in the recipes.<br />AUSSIE FOOD, MATE-The author has recipes for Anzac biscuits (I kid you not: he has both the original version and an updated one) and apple chutney, but not angel food cake, which is a sine qua non of pâtisserie.  Many of the recipes use &quot;light treacle&quot;.  Marzipan is used liberally throughout the text, and most Americans are not terribly fond of it, but the British are; a similar comment applies to fruit cake and its relatives.  The use of the word &quot;biscuit&quot; carries its British/Aussie meaning, not the American one.  Some of his American recipes are a bit off, such as yeasted cornbread, a Creole blackbread (gingerbread) that uses treacle rather than molasses, a second-rate chocolate chip cookie, and the strangest muffin recipe I have ever seen.  Many of the batter-based recipes have a thick, gummy texture that does not improve much after baking.<br />ENCYCLOPEDIA?-One of the few nice things I can say about this book is that all of the entries are alphabetical, making it a quick and handy reference book.  Unfortunately, much of the information is perfunctory and/or useless, certainly not as illuminating asone would expect of a book with the word &quot;encyclopedia&quot; in the title.  The description and recipe for mousse are pathetic. Some recipes call for a brioche mold, but the author never tells you what it is or what it looks like. The distinction between cake, gateau, and torte is artificial and mostly wrong. The definitions of cognac and armagnac are wrong. The chart of various types of sugar is interesting, but not always applicable to sugar here in the US. This &quot;encyclopedia&quot; could also have benefited from a closer editing.<br />SAY WHAT?-Some of the information is anecdotal in nature and should not have appeared in print without some sort of reference.  There are absolutely no footnotes, and I suspect that the author used sources not listed in the brief bibliography (listing a paltry 2 dozen books). The stories are told with a British/Australian slant.<br />IT IS NOT ALL BAD-The author is the only person I know of who has actually experimented with agar-agar, and discovered that it is triple the strength of gelatin (it is sometimes stronger than that, depending on the texture of the mixture you put it into).  I liked the Dutch Apple Torte.  You could criticize many of the flavor combinations as odd (viz ground almonds in a baked apple or sweetened avocado mousse) or the use of yeasted batter for an apple fritter, but this is par for the course.  If you are trying to figure out what an obscure British/Australian pastry is (e.g. you have an odd name, say &quot;Bara Brith&quot;, that is not in any of your regular pastry books), this is the place to look.  I was also impressed by the generous quantity (but not the quality) of recipes.  I also happily note that the recipes are not overly sweet, unlike some other very famous dessert and baking books.  All the recipes have both volume and weight measurements.<br />CONCLUSION-This is an amusing (for the wrong reasons) book, but only marginally useful except to the professional.e would expect of a book with the word &quot;encyclopedia&quot; in the title.

I was also suspicious because it is full of color photos showing various techniques; a good food stylist is no substitute for good recipes and well-written procedures. On balance, it is a good, but not great book on candy making in the home kitchen.<br />The book is divided into two parts.  The first part contains mini-lessons on how to perform candy-making basics, complete with detailed series of pictures.  Note that this book was actually written in England, so the recipes have a decidedly British slant.  The section entitled &quot;Bright-hued disks of hardened syrup&quot; is your basic hard candy, but it is never called as such as is described as simply a method for making lollipops.  Missing is the wide variety of colors and flavors possible.  Also curiously missing are instructions for using hard candy molds to make nice little shapes and lozenges of all descriptions.  It has instructions for making barley sugar, which is unknown to Americans.  It has hard to find instructions for making fondant and marzipan in the home kitchen from scratch.  The section on tempering and dipping in chocolate is confusing, as two entirely different things-pure chocolate and summer coating-are kind of squashed together in the same procedure.  Some of the procedures involve dipping chocolate or summer coating, but never refer back to section on tempering as reminder that the latter must be followed in lieu of the short description in the procedures on dipping.  I also find basic the description of how to cook sugar to be inadequate.  Being English cookery, a large amount of space is devoted to pulled taffy, and also to marzipan confections.  The instructions for nougat are also faulty: if followed literally, the syrup will cool and harden before the egg whites are ready.<br />Several elements are missing.  Most important is the lack of safety information.  The easiest way to end up in the emergency room at the hospital is to burn yourself with super-hot sugar heated to 300 degrees.  You will not find a dissertation on the various types of sugars, syrups, or cooking utensils.  Also missing is any information about the fancy copper sugar pot used in many of the pictures (which retails for about $125 last time I checked), or anything about how to care for or clean it.  You must be careful about choosing the pot you use for cooking sugar, but this advice is missing from the book.  You will also not find anything on apples dipped in soft caramel or fresh fruits dipped in caramelized sugar, both very popular American confections.<br />The second part is a collection of 265 recipes gathered from many books and the four corners of the globe.  The main problem is that the editor did little more than translate the recipes procedures and ingredients to their modern equivalents.  The recipes were changed as little as possible to retain the original mood, but this also means that the procedures by and large have not been vetted and corrected.  Therefore, you should not assume that the recipes in the second part are as reliable as the pictured procedures in the first part.  Some of the recipes require several of the procedures from the first part, but these are not always reliably indicated in the recipes; the neophyte is left guessing.

You will not find a dissertation on the various types of sugars, syrups, or cooking utensils.  Also missing is any information about the fancy copper sugar pot used in many of the pictures (which retails for about $125 last time I checked), or anything about how to care for or clean it.  You must be careful about choosing the pot you use for cooking sugar, but this advice is missing from the book.  You will also not find anything on apples dipped in soft caramel or fresh fruits dipped in caramelized sugar, both very popular American confections.  <br />The second part is a collection of 265 recipes gathered from many books and the four corners of the globe.  The main problem is that the editor did little more than translate the recipes procedures and ingredients to their modern equivalents.  The recipes were changed as little as possible to retain the original mood, but this also means that the procedures by and large have not been vetted and corrected.  Therefore, you should not assume that the recipes in the second part are as reliable as the pictured procedures in the first part.  Some of the recipes require several of the procedures from the first part, but these are not always reliably indicated in the recipes; the neophyte is left guessing.

However, the execution here was only so-so, and the result is a mediocre, but reasonably reliable cookbook that shows you how to make candy at home.<br />The procedures are unusually complete, and everything is thoroughly explained (at least in most cases); it is not unusual for a recipe to have a dozen or more steps.  It also lists all of the tools and equipment that you will need.  I find the step of sticking your fingers in boiling water to see if all of the sugar is dissolved, and then using a wet paper towel to wipe down the sides of the pot to be objectionable.  Some of the forming steps are inadequately explained; a few diagrams would be helpful.  It is also the only cookbook I know of that considers a barometer to be standard kitchen equipment.<br />The first section of no-cook recipes produces low quality candy.  These are melt and form, sugary lumps that used to appear regularly at PTA bake sales.  They were regularly published in women's magazines as candy making for the busy mom.  The textures range from too gooey to very crumbly, and most were quite treacly.  The marshmallow recipe seems to be rather odd (although I did not try it).<br />The next section is candy based on sugar cooked to a specific temperature: fudge, caramel, taffy, brittle, toffee, fondant, divinity, hard candy, and caramel popcorn (i.e. Cracker Jacks).  The fudge chapter has a surprising number of recipes; sadly, they are variations on the same recipe.  The caramel recipe is not a particularly flavorful one, but it does work as advertised.<br />The chapters on dipping were interesting.  Two methods of dipping in chocolate are given, and both involve fingers rather than dipping tools.  They were fun and very messy, but less efficient than just using a dipping fork.  The instructions for tempering chocolate were unusually detailed and complete, but the home cook is still probably going to fail at this the first few times.<br />The book ends with some perfunctory chapters on decorating candies and some craft projects for making packaging for the candies.te were unusually detailed and complete, but the home cook is still probably going to fail at this the first few times.  <br />The book ends with some perfunctory chapters on decorating candies and some craft projects for making packaging for the candies.	2004-05-16
US	50042615	RY5V63V7CLSQU	0064633918	608924117	Homemade Candy	Books	3	4	4	N	Y	Genuine Homemade Candy	This modest little paperback has achieved legendary status.  Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 people who try recipes from this cookbook will fail the first few times.  For this reason, I give it a mediocre rating.<br />The copyright is 1970, but the recipes themselves date back several decades before this.  It came from an era when all women were housewives, and they were all expected to know how to make candy.  The recipes are a listing of ingredients and some bare-bones instructions; the housewife was expected to know how to fill in the details.  Some recipes are barely half a dozen brief, declamatory sentences.  The casual cook these days will likely not have this knowledge.<br />On the other hand, it is a valuable collection of heirloom candy and confectionary recipes.  Those who know their way around the candy kitchen or who have some professional training or experience should have very little trouble with most of the recipes; the ones I tried worked perfectly and the other recipes seem to be equally reliable (having Friberg and Gisslen to refer to was a big help).  A tremendous variety of candy from a bygone era can be made from this cookbook.  There are more than enough quality recipes to fill a candy store or start a business.  Be careful, as not all of the recipes produce high quality candy (for example, the chapters on popcorn balls and cereal squares were pretty awful).  It includes fudge, creams, nougat, dipped chocolates, fondant, candy bars, brittles, toffee, bark, pralines, fruit jellies, caramel, hard candies, sugared nuts, fruit rolls, etc.<br />All in all, this book is an essential part of the candy making bookshelf.  It shows how candy used to be made in the home kitchen, the likes of which we shall not see again.	2004-05-05

I have read descriptions of and seem pictures of displays of cookies in sweet shops in Paris about a century ago. They contain a bewildering display of massive amounts of cookies in endless varieties. Today, these displays are almost extinct. This book is probably your last chance to learn how to produce these cookies, both for the amateur home cook and the professional.  The authors seem to have done quite a bit of research and trial-and-error, as most of the recipes seem to be revivals and recreations as opposed to a recording of how they were actually done in production.  As a result, the recipes have much more in common than they would have if they were the actual, original recipes.<br />The key to all these different types is variation. In this book, there are many dozens of cookies, all very different in look and taste, yet all are based on only 7 basic recipes. With minor alterations in forming and flavors, you get a totally different cookie from the same recipe.  Once you can make the basic recipe in a chapter, you can make all of the other cookies in the chapter, which is usually one or two dozen more. The seven types are: creamed sugar and butter, meringue, almond paste, sponge cake, tuiles, pâte sucr&eacute;e, and puff pastry (yes, the authors expect you to make your own). I should also point out that these are traditional, fancy French patisserie; you will not find chocolate chips, oatmeal raisin cartwheels, or gingerbread men.<br />The book also has several unusual instructions.  Some recipes require a resting period of a few hours or even overnight. Whipping egg whites requires that you go past the stiff peak stage, a no-no in my book.  It also calls for baking on a piece of newspaper, and wetting down the paper after baking to get the cookies off. They may seem odd, but each one worked as advertised, and you are well advised to follow the directions to the letter; attempts to skip them and do it the &quot;normal&quot; way will meet with failure. You will also need a substantial collection of unusual and specialty baking pans which are hard to find, if you can find them at all. I also find the instructions for tempering chocolate to be inadequate, and used a standard method for tempering chocolate.  In the chapter on pâte sucr&eacute;e, one is instructed to use the &quot;smear&quot; method of dough, it specifies ammonium carbonate and not baking soda, and it states that if the temperature is above 75, you can not do these recipes (the same author remark applies to the chapter on puff pastry).  It also instructs you to wet the baking pan before putting down the dough so it stays glued down.  The chapter on puff pastry has a good recipe for using up scraps along with recommended recipes that can use it.  It also has a good and reliable recipe for chocolate puff pastry.<br />There are several nice touches to the recipes. All have a specific list of equipment that you need; however, they only list the baking sheets and preparation, and not other equipment like food processors or blenders. Each recipe also has a specific amount of time that you can store the cookies; some will last a week, while others must be eaten the same day, while frozen, uncooked dough will last longer. The procedure of each recipe is also extremely detailed, and leaves nothing to chance; in this respect, this book is exemplary and would be a good template for anyone contemplating writing a cookbook.  Some recipes take up 2 pages. Also worthy of note is that the recipe amounts are listed in weight, as well as volume.<br />The first part of each chapter also features a rather extensive primer on the techniques featured in the recipes for that chapter. The beginning of each chapter also features a very handy and useful to index to all of the recipes for that chapter.  This book is a massive tome of 500 pages, including an impressive 90 pages just on references and detailed procedures.  Here, for example, you will find a complete explanation of the brief and inadequate procedures of tempering chocolate in the recipes.  The explanation and diagrams for making a cornet is hopelessly wrong.  It has a rare explanation on the proper use of the pastry bag.  It also calls for Vaseline as a pan coating (I would advise against this; try non-stick cooking spray with lecithin instead).<br />Best of all, every one of the cookies I tried were wonderful and worth the effort, and most were not harder to make than ordinary cookies from standard cookbooks; in some cases, they were easier since this book had the details missing from most recipes.  This is a reliable and extensive resource for traditional, French cookies.

It represents itself as a survey of 200 years of baking in American kitchens. In the end, the result is a rather ordinary collection of baking and pastry recipes. This collection is supposed to be a collage of 200 years of baking recipes. The book has numerous references to old, out of print recipe books. Then, the author takes these recipes and updates it for the modern kitchen and grocery store.<br />In the bread chapter, for example, all of the dough make-up procedures are virtually identical. This is suspicious, as the sources, hydration percentages, and ingredients for the bread recipes go all over the place. I suspect that the author here has cheated a bit. Also, the procedures do not have very extensive descriptions of how to form the doughs into loaves. Some of the instructions for preparing the various fruits are either incomplete or wrong, as are procedures for cooking sugar into syrups, caramels, etc.<br />I like the fact that the procedures (for the most part) are very detailed, and many of the little steps that are often overlooked are thorough described here. The recipes often have as many as a dozen steps. The beginning of each chapter has some baking tips and hints, although they are far from complete.  At the head of each chapter is a list of recipes, which is very convenient when you are looking for something specific. The most valuable part of this book is the bibliography, which lists many historic cookbooks, many of which are still available in facsimile editions. Very valuable, and hard to find, are the dozen or so recipes for doughnuts; these alone are almost worth the price of admission.<br />On the other hand, many chapters are collections of fairly standard recipes that you can find in almost any all purpose cookbook. The one about pies, for example, is very ordinary and commonplace, most of them currently popular ones, and not historic nor heritage in any sense of the word. It is a very decent collection of baking recipes that covers most of the major areas of baking, but it is not as advertised.on of baking recipes that covers most of the major areas of baking, but it is not as advertised.	2004-03-07

I like the recipes, but think the layout and book design are irritating. I am not sure whether to recommend this book or not.<br />The book cover is a garish affair with bright pink color and gold leaf. The interior pages are littered with romantic sayings and pictures. On the other hand, it is spiral bound, so it lays flat on the table when you are doing the recipes, which I appreciate very much.<br />There are a paltry 50 or so recipes. They all appear to be thoroughly tested, so the procedures are easy to follow and I had not problems with any of the ones I tried, although I was skeptical about some of them (for example, heating chocolate in a saucepan over low heat is a good way to burn it; the instructions for folding egg foam based batters are not really explained in detail, etc.). I got several very good recipes, especially the dense tortes that are baked in a tart pan.  It has chapters on cookies, ice creams, pies and pastries, cakes and tortes, and sauces.	2004-02-29

This book, however, is a reliable resource that you can depend on for baked goods in your home oven.<br />The most important feature of this book is that all of the recipes are written by professional bakers (of whom there are some 2 dozen or so, some you will recognize, all are seasoned bakers from various commercial settings), and the recipes are scaled-down versions of reliable production recipes.  The instructions are exemplary in their detail and completeness. All things considered, this is also an excellent learning tool for the beginner. When I need to learn something new (such as rugelach or naan), this is one of the first books I reach for.<br />The first chapter has an extensive section on basic techniques and words that you do not usually get in even a good baking book. It has some basic recipes that must be mastered before you go on to the recipes in the rest of the book, like genoise or meringue. It also has chapters on bread (Daily; Artisanal, Flatbreads), breakfast goods and quick breads, cakes (Everyday, Showstoppers, Wedding Cake, Cookies), and pastries (Pies, Grand, Savory). It has a good selection of all the major categories you are likely to want to do at home.	2004-02-27

However, it is true that these pies always work no matter how clumsy you are in the kitchen. You must leave these pies in the refrigerator or freezer for several hours to finish the recipes. Most of all, they taste good and are easy to do, since you never bake them.<br />I am glad somone wrote this book. The whole spectrum of old fashioned pies that do not get baked has virtually disappeared; to get a recipe, you will need to consult a cookbook that is at least 30 years old. This is  ashame, as many of these pies are easy to do and taste fabulous, and are definitely worth doing in your home (but probably not as a restaurant dessert).  There is a lot of history in this collection of pie recipes.<br />The first chapter has 15 recipes for pie crusts. Fortunately for us clumsy people, all of them are based on cookies or crackers that you crush in a food processor. No doughs or rolling pins here. You just press it into a pie pan and bake for a few minutes. My complaint here is that all of them are either very sweet (from using packaged cookies, which is very clever) or strongly flavored (from graham crackers). I could not find one that was relatively neutral in flavor.<br />There are roughly 70 or so pie recipes. They include mousses and custards (20), chocolate (17), fruit (10), ice cream (17), showstoppers (7). The crusts and finishing touches are listed as suggestions at the end of each pie filling recipe, so you get to choose what you want and can vary them if you want. The fillings are mainly based on cornstarch (custards and pastry cream), whipped cream (cream pies), whipped egg whites, and gelatin (variously bavarian cream, chiffons, mousses, etc., although the author does not always use these terms as appropriate).  There are many varied fillings, including a few cheesecakes and some fruit pies.<br />My complaints are few. Some of the caption texts are pastel colored fonts which are sometimes hard to read. Some of the cooking procedures are unusual and called for extra steps, but are easy to follow and always worked.

Some of the worst bread in the world is to be found in Britain, and some of the best in France. Upon reading this book, however, you might get the opposite impression. The attitude of the authors to non-British breads is rather pedestrian. The suggestion to hollow out savory brioche and stuff it with mushrooms or grilled peppers is not one of &quot;the most delicious ways of using&quot; it, but a rather horrid suggestion (the book is full of such marginal serving suggestions). It also criticizes Pain Poilane because it can be &quot;disappointing&quot;, as if British bread were any better.<br />The first 3 dozen pages have a history and primer on bread making. The section on forming breads is too short to be of any help; you will need to consult a more detailed explanation in another bread book. The next hundred pages is an atlas with 2 dozen or so countries and the breads therein. In spite of the fact that each bread description has a chatty entry, the descriptions of the individual breads do not always describe what the ingredients are or what it tastes like. Not all encyclopedia entries have a picture, although many of them do (all of the recipes do). The last section has roughly 100 bread recipes of varying quality. Many are very interesting, using such things like all purpose flour or employing a second dough kneading after the initial proof. On the whole, I liked the recipe section but thought that the encyclopedia section was kind of a waste of time. The only real problem is the small size of the text (you'll need reading glasses for this one) to go along with the small 7 x 9 size of the page.<br />The authors are British; on the good side, it means that all of the flour measurements in the recipes are listed by weight (halleluiah!), but it also means that some of the terminology is confusing to Americans. The ingredients are those of a British grocery store, so you will have to make substitutions for American ingredients (equivalents are not supplied).<br />The procedures are mostly very detailed and easy to follow, although steps describing the proper dough textures or doneness while baking breads are not detailed enough (for example, if you follow their instructions for baking croissants, you will under bake them) Some of the procedures are difficult to understand or execute, and often lacking in sufficient detail. Also, the hydration levels of some of the doughs were apparently not correct, and the recipe instructions do not always describe the proper dough texture. The proofing times were often too short. The procedures listed for some of the sourdough breads may or may not work as specified.<br />It is an interesting, useful, and wide-ranging collection of European bread recipes not often found here in the US (there are a dozen or so American bread recipes). They have interesting flavors, but not all of them are good. It is a good collection of bread recipes to have, and many are worth trying at least once.

As many as half (depending on how pick you are) are out of date ones that you will never do. What I like best is that all of the recipes are thoroughly tested and worked as advertised, even those that look wrong (like Soldier's Fudge). You can pick a recipe and rely on the instructions being correct, without having to worry about a problem. This is a nice, but not great chocolate cookbook.<br />There are a few fascinating recipes, like chocolate crepes, chocolate pate a choux dough, and an unusual Sacher Tort that uses bread crumbs (unfortunately, the texture of the cake is rather gritty). Happily, there are not many recipes that rely on whipped egg whites. For cakes, shortening is specified, and margarine is preferred for cookies; the flavor is not as good as butter, but the texture is superior.	2004-02-17

I especially like the way the spiral-bound book rests open flat on the table while you are doing the recipes. The author seems to have thoroughly kitchen tested all of the recipes, unlike many other chocolate cookbooks, and the procedures are mostly of good quality. I had no trouble with any of the recipes I tried. This cookbook is an interesting, all-purpose collection of chocolate recipes that I enjoy using. It is a useful addition to your bookshelf, and one that you will use often.<br />In the cake section, there are several interesting, old-fashioned recipes: a mayonnaise cake, the infamous Tunnel of Fudge, and a pudding cake where the sauce migrates to the bottom of the pan during baking (yes, it really works that way). Of course, some recipes were only mediocre: the Blackout Cake did not really live up to its name, and the Chocolate Gingerbread was off a little. On the other hand, there are a number of fascinating desserts I plan to try. The chapter on showstoppers contains several restaurant quality desserts that are still current. There are also several interesting variants on truffle torte and chocolate decadence.  It also has a number of very good chocolate cookies.<br />There is a welcome lack of recipes based on whipped egg white, the bane of many home cooks. It also does not eschew the many wonderful chocolate recipes based on raw egg white, as do many current chocolate cookbooks, causing many of these nice recipes to vanish. As a practical manner, you can use the many pasteurized eggs in a carton or egg white products available in most supermarkets for these recipes. The book contains the standard warning about raw eggs at the bottom of each recipe that uses them.<br />Some of the instructions are a little too facile, such as working with filo, rolling out marzipan, cooking sugar syrups, or mixing melted chocolate directly with cold, whipped cream. Each recipe lists preparation times, and the author is diligent about noting time-related steps, like chill or rest times, in each recipe as appropriate, as well as logical stopping points. It also has its share of frumpy, old time recipes that you would never do, such as baked tortilla chips in chocolate sauce, or s'mores. It has numerous, convenient recipes for busy cooks, including a few god-awful dishes, like Quick Cr&egrave;me de Menthe Pie.  On the down side, most recipes do not have storage instructions for the finished, leftover desserts.<br />It has chapters on cake, cheesecake, pies and tarts, fancy desserts, commercial mixes, ice cream, microwave, kids, puddings, yeasted breads, frostings, candy, and cookies.cipe lists preparation times, and the author is diligent about noting time-related steps, like chill or rest times, in each recipe as appropriate, as well as logical stopping points.

This book was the first of its type, full of rich chocolate recipes and glorious, color pictures, and it is still one of the very best. The recipe instructions are more reliable and easier to execute than most other chocolate cookbooks, although I have doubts about some of the decorative procedures in the appendix for the average home cook. Whenever I need a chocolate recipe, this is the book I reach for first.<br />Chocolate is notoriously difficult to cook and bake with, and many chocolate cookbooks are equally notorious for their difficult to execute recipes. Medrich is not professionally trained, so you will not find the usual array of vaguely described professional recipe instructions. Instead, you will find procedures of the author's own invention, and these are thoroughly described and easy to follow (in fact, many are unique ones that you will not find elsewhere); I almost never have trouble executing them. The recipes themselves are endlessly fascinating, and I discovered several new things, such as: cake pans do not need to be buttered and floured, the secret to her rich version of truffles, and that a hot milk sponge is better for roulades than a genoise. The only error I found is the recipe for simple syrup (it should be 2 cups sugar to 2 cups water).<br />The appendix, which describes &quot;Building Blocks&quot; and &quot;Finishing Techniques&quot;, is more troublesome. The first section has basic components that are used in the rest of the recipes, and you will have to spend time getting the hang of making things like meringue, genoise, or lady fingers. The second half, while not impossible to do at home, is for the dedicated amateur pastry chef only. For these, I suggest that you just skip them; whipped cream in a can, bottled commercial dessert sauces, or pre-made cake decorating supplies from the grocery store are acceptable. The author became famous for her simple, yet strikingly elegant and under-stated decorating techniques; you will miss this element of her desserts, but they will still taste great.<br />Of all the chocolate recipes I produce in my home kitchen, at least half come from this cookbook. It sort of looks like a coffee table book full of worthless recipes, but here looks are deceiving. Virtually all of the recipes are good ones that are worth doing. The instructions are exemplary, and almost all of the recipes have a matching picture so you can see what the end result should look like.  Experienced home bakers will be fascinated by the introductory material in the first 30 or so pages. Beginners should spend time reading through all of the recipes, and then select those that are easier to do; sadly, the author does not rate here recipes for difficulty.ceptable.

This book is a valuable collection of these mostly forgotten bread recipes, although it suffers the common fault of insufficient instructions of how to actually shape the various bread shapes.<br />I am happy to have this collection of rare recipes that are on the verge of disappearing forever. It contains breads specific to the major holidays throughout the calendar year, although Easter and Christmas contain the vast majority of recipes.  Most of them are variations of stollen or panettone.  By my count, there are almost 150 recipes, not including icings and glazes.  The table of contents has a handy list of the various holidays and the corresponding bread recipes.<br />The most interesting part of this cookbook is also the most lacking. Many of the breads have unique shapes, but the author's instructions on how to form these loaves are often perfunctory, and you are left to guess how to do it.  There are some helpful line drawings, but a picture of each finished, baked bread would have been very interesting.<br />I had fun making some of the breads in this fascinating bread cookbook. I had no trouble with any of the recipes, since the mixing instructions on all the breads are virtually the same, and if you can do stollen, you can do the breads in this book. The author suggests all purpose flour, but I found that the loaves had more texture if I used bread flour. The author does not explicitly say so, but the listed weight of 4 1/2 oz. of flour per cup suggests that she uses the spoon and sweep method of measuring flour. The kneading instructions say &quot;until smooth&quot;, without defining what this means. In my kitchen, it took longer than the listed rise times for the dough. I also found the baking time and temperatures to be off: my oven required a higher temperature, and the baking times were both longer and shorter than the ones listed in the recipes. The only test for doneness suggested by the author is by tapping the hot loaves and listening for a hollow sound, but a more suggestive method would have been more helpful, such as the correct crust color.onger and shorter than the ones listed in the recipes.

I am glad to say that this is a source of very good, but not great desserts. There are several things I like about this cookbook. All of the recipes were thoroughly tested, and I had no problem with the ones I tried, although some recipes required more than casual talent and there are no warnings about this in the recipes. Most of the recipes are assembly jobs. That is, the components are prepared at least a day before and assembled that day. The garnishes and plating are also completely described and recipes given for them; this way, there is no question of how to serve them. These are mostly professional restaurant desserts that have been successfully adapted to the American kitchen. So, these recipes are suitable for both restaurant and home. There is nothing here that is very difficult, but some are time consuming and have several preliminary steps. Herm&eacute; for the most part eschews decorative, architectural structures and focuses on the flavor of the dish.<br />The chapter &quot;Basic Recipes&quot; contains components used by recipes in the other chapters. It is an interesting collection of recipes, some with curious wrinkles. Some of them, like pâte bris&eacute;e, meringue or inside-out puff pastry, do not work as well as standard versions. Some, like cr&egrave;me anglaise or pastry cream, are actually better than standard ones because they list actual temperatures rather than a physical description as the end point, meaning that the less experienced will have a good chance of doing them properly. Some recipes, like Lemon Cream, are a lot of extra effort without any discernable improvement. In this chapter, standard French names in addition to the American ones used would have been nice, especially for those who have not had a lot of experience with French patisserie.<br />The next two chapters, &quot;Fruits, Creams, and Cookies&quot; and &quot;Tarts and Tartlets&quot; are much more interesting. Herm&eacute;'s use of fresh fruits is particularly impressive, particularly in simple fruit plates and tarts. The little tricks he uses are well worth learning and applying elsewhere, like burning off cr&egrave;me chiboust with a propane torch, adding freshly ground pepper to fresh fruits (I believe he is the one who invented this), or using chopped, drained oranges by itself as a tart filling. Some his tricks, however do not really help; draining or drying fruit produced a nice texture, but they lost their fresh fruit flavor.<br />The last chapter on cakes was rather ordinary. In particular, I did not really like the flavor of the chocolate cakes. They have all sorts of other flavors added in, and they did not combine well with the chocolate.  The combinations are trendy, and many of them are already out of date (book copyright is 1998).<br />The last chapter is particularly useful: it has explanations of the procedures and equipment used throughout the book. My only complaint here is that marzipan and almond paste certainly are not the same thing, nor are they interchangeable. It is here, buried at the end of the section on measuring, that you discover how flour is measured for the recipes (they use dip and sweep).and Tartlets&quot; are much more interesting.

It is very small: 3 by 7 inches, and about 90 pages. Upon closer examination, however, one finds a well chosen collection of 40 or so recipes. Sadly, the recipe instructions are inadequate. I suggest you steer clear of this pamphlet, unless you are in the mood to test and fix some recipes.<br />I like the selection of recipes very much. Most of the very popular chocolate desserts that you are likely to be asked to make are included. Except for the souffl&eacute; and cake rolls, all of the recipes are well within the ability of the home cook.<br />The instructions and quality of the recipes were a big disappointment; this is surprising, as the source of this pamphlet is a well respected periodical with a usually thorough test kitchen. Of the recipes I tried, about half were not acceptable: either the flavor or texture was wrong, or the procedure was inadequate. For example: the buttercream was oily and gritty, whip cream with the amount of additions they suggest did not whip properly, the procedure for making chocolate cigarettes do not work, the chocolate pot de cr&egrave;me recipe is adequate for 4 or 6 servings and not the 8 specified, the chocolate upside down cake did not unmold properly (recipe hint not withstanding), instructions for folding together multiple ingredients were not clear, and so on.	2004-01-26

On the other hand, this bread baking book is no better than other generic cookbooks with bread recipes. The recipes and procedures are lacking in necessary detail. This is a valuable collection of bread recipes, but only for those willing to devote the time and effort to properly adapt them to the home kitchen.<br />The author correctly points out that until the last century, all breads were sourdough based, meaning that you had regularly feed, care for, and keep alive the yeast like a beloved family pet. Upon the invention of commercial yeast, almost all bread bakers switched. The commercial stuff is easier to deal with and more profitable, but it also means that the breads have much less flavor.  In this book, the author has assembled a standard collection of bread recipes using a sourdough starter instead of the usual commercial yeast.  He has recipes for standard loaf breads, ryes, egg breads, whole wheat, French, rolls, buns, pancakes, waffles, batter breads, and the like.  Of particular interest are the kamut and spelt bread recipes (both are ancient predecessors to our modern wheat), and the bread machine recipes.<br />On the down side, the author does not seem to have devoted much time to developing proper recipe instructions. He has one master recipe (for loaves, for example), and all the other ones are just ingredient variations of the master. This a problem, as the breads go all over the place; some are heavy, dense ones, some are similar to French breads, and others have vastly different hydration levels (moisture content). This common procedure does not work for all the varieties of different breads. All the doughs that require kneading simply say &quot;until dough is satiny&quot;, but this description is never explained. Most of the loaves have both milk and butter as ingredients, including those breads where this is inappropriate. The various ethnic breads also have traditional makeup methods for the dough in their country of origin, but the author simply ignores them and uses his master recipe procedure, whether it is correct or not. To proof the doughs, a temperature of 85 degrees is specified; to get this, the author has rigged up a Styrofoam ice chest with a 15 watt bulb jammed into it.<br />The wild yeast starter that I have makes sourdough that is similar to the classic San Francisco one (I live near, but not in, SF). I had trouble getting my culture to work properly with the recipes in this book. Most of his recipes have a 1 to 2 hour proof, but my culture at standard room temperature-around 70 or so-takes 4 to 6 hours to proof properly, sometimes more on a cold day. The rye breads I tried produced a loaf that was unacceptably heavy and dense, unless you are going to use it as construction material. This is not to say that the recipes are worthless. The experienced home baker should be able to work out the problems with a little experimentation and some test bakes; this is certainly worth the trouble, as many recipes are important ones that you will want to do on a regular basis. The many non-loaf recipes are especially useful, as they give you something to do with the extra yeast (which I often just throw out) when you refresh the starter and do not feel like making yet another loaf of bread.<br />The author commits the ultimate sin in baking books: not telling us how he measures the flour, nor what weight of flour to use. This information is the sine qua non of proper baking.  I should also note that much of this book is an advertisement to get to buy the live sourdough cultures that the author sells. Many of his recipes require the use of a &quot;fast&quot; culture, which most sourdough cultures are not (mine certainly is not). By coincidence, he sells such a culture, which he calls &quot;Russian&quot;. Many of the recipes seem to have been  developed for this specific culture. For these breads, I suggest that you simply use a commercial yeast; I know this defeats the whole purpose of this book, but his description of the Russian culture seems to be similar to the regular yeasts you can get at the supermarket.<br />I found almost no editorial errors. The make-up instructions for a couple of breads were inscrutable (like Butterflake Rolls). The reference on page 119 should say &quot;page 28&quot;. The pizza recipe, when made as specified, produced a thin, cracker-like crust; I believe there is an error somewhere in the recipe; I fixed it by reducing the oven temperature, and making the crust much smaller and therefore thicker. A more detailed Table of Contents would make it easier to find recipes.he recipes seem to have been  developed for this specific culture.

My enthusiasm, however, is tempered by the frequently incomplete recipe procedures. In their attempt to adapt these famous patisserie dishes to the American kitchen, they seem to have simplified the recipes by simply leaving out a lot of vital instructions and information. Deficiencies not withstanding, this is an amazing collection of 201 recipes. In the end, I highly recommend this book for professionals or the enthusiastic amateur pastry chef, but the average person messing around in his kitchen at home should avoid this book.<br />Lenotre is a legendary pastry chef in France, and this book is a collection of his recipes. The dishes are relatively simple (but not always easy to execute); however, the flavors and designs are mostly classic and well thought out. After considering this book, one can rightly see why Lenotre became famous. Some of the more uncommon recipes that are very worthwhile: Friands, Savoy Sponge Cake, Basque Cake, and Raisin Buns. Even though the instructions are frequently problematic, they are worth the effort it takes to correct them, because the desserts are truly wonderful.  The book presents an impressive array of different desserts and pastries using only a few basic doughs and creams. The end of the book has 5 series of pictures on making and forming various doughs.<br />Each recipe has estimated preparation times, needed utensils, and a difficulty rating in addition to the usual recipe, all of which is greatly appreciated and a big help.  This will ensure that you are properly prepared for each recipe. Also unusual but extremely useful are the freezing, refrigeration, and thawing instructions that are included with most recipes. Also please note that on page 36 is a picture of properly baked croissants; the color is very dark brown, compared to Americans, who usually under-bake them.  Unfortunately, the instructions are rarely complete. Many steps are usually omitted, and some steps are not adequately explained. This is not a problem to an experienced baker who can fill in the missing bits, but will cause the neophyte no end to trouble, meaning a good likelihood of failure.<br />The most significant problems are in the first 2 chapters on doughs, batters, creams and syrups. Very few of these recipes can be done successful by the beginner just by following the supplied instructions. This is a shame, as the recipes in the rest of the book use these as a base. For the more experienced, I suggest that the recipes in the rest of the book be used, but use standard professional recipes for such things as pastry cream, meringue, and the like. The flan on page 217 has bubbles on the sides (a sign that it was baked at too high a temperature). The fritter recipe does not have a temperature for the oil. The page reference on page 297 is wrong (should be 296). The chocolate souffl&eacute; on page 234 is the only recipe I tried that failed.<br /><br />This book has the following chapters: Basic Recipes for Doughs and Batters; Basic Recipes for Creams and Syrups; Breakfast and Coffee Cakes; Large Cakes and Desserts; Pies and Tarts; Little Pastries; Hot Desserts-Omelettes and Souffl&eacute;s; Cold Desserts-Charlottes and Stewed Fruit; Petits Fours and Cookies.itted, and some steps are not adequately explained.

The Cake Bible by Beranbaum is the only one I can recommend without reservation, as the recipes and techniques all work. On the whole, I like this book quite a bit and use it fairly often as a reference.<br />The author has done wedding cakes professionally for many years, and this cookbook is a compendium of tried and true recipes that she has used. This is both good and bad. These are baking recipes that are battle tested and ones that you can rely upon, especially on special occassions. On the other hand, it is a very personal collection of production recipes, and you will not find several common cake types because she has not done them in her professional experience.<br />Several recipe types, such as butter cakes, genoise, and buttercreams, are very different from the usual ones that you will find in other baking books. This is because they are a record of the author's efforts, and not just a mechanical recapitulation of standard patissierie recipes. The procedures at first seemed to be unnecessarily finicky, and had a few extra steps that did not seem to be necessary. On the other hand, I had no problems with any of the ones I tried. The procedures are often unique; while the results were not better than standard recipes, they can, in some cases, be slightly easier to execute than standard recipes, which are more prone to failure by the home baker.<br />The arrangement of the cakes chapter is particularly useful. It assumes that you will work methodically through the chapter, baking each cake as you go, and not just pick out recipes at random. It lists pound cakes first, and ends up with genoise-type cakes, which makes more sense than the usual order, which is the other way around; foam-based cakes are the most difficult.<br />Interestingly, only the first 160 pages of this 550 page book relates to cakes. 60 pages go to showcase cakes, 200 pages to decoration, fillings and frostings, 50 pages to ingredients and equipment, and 70 pages for professionals (including extensive insturctions of wedding cakes; I cannot vouch for this section, since I have never made a wedding cake).<br />There are some criticisms, but they are mostly ones of omission. Many of the page references are wrong. I object to the suggestion of leaving eggs and chocolate in a warm oven overnight to get them to the proper temperature. Cornstarch is substituted for part of the flour in genoise, but this was not any better than just straight flour. The instructions for waffles are for an old-fashioned, stove top iron and not an electric one. The instructions for making the rose trellis are incomplete. The table of contents need to be more detailed. The chapter subheadings in Part III are used inconsistently. The flavor-cake-filling-frosting combinations the author suggests are not the classic ones; you will need another patissierie book if you need the traditional ones. On the positive side, all the wedding cakes described have pictures. There are several different recipes for chocolate genoise (including one without added butter), one of my favorites. There is also an old fashioned mayonnaise cake. The 2 pancake recipes are ones with whipped egg whites, but none with the plain old baking powder.<br />The only reservation I have is that this book is not all that friendly or instructive for beginners. For them, I would suggest that you bake some cakes from the first 150 page section and ignore the rest of the book until you become more advanced, making sure that you go through this section in order rather than skipping around.ings and frostings, 50 pages to ingredients and equipment, and 70 pages for professionals (including extensive insturctions of wedding cakes; I cannot vouch for this section, since I have never made a wedding cake).<br />There are some criticisms, but they are mostly ones of omission.

I find it to be reliable and very well done, and worthwhile for those looking for a simple cookbook suitable for someone who is not an amateur chef. It is certainly one of the better cookbooks of its kind.<br />The physical layout makes this book a pleasure to use. It has plenty of pictures and drawings. The pages are color coded. On the right side of the pages is a recipe, and on the left side are plenty of related hints, explanations, and tips so that even the uninitiated can prepare the recipe successfully. Even those who are experienced will learn a few new things, such as how to make your own paper frills for lamb chops, or what causes some chickens to have white skin, and others yellow.<br />The recipes themselves are very well done. They appear to have all been thoroughly tested, and people of all skill levels will be able to make the recipes.  The recipes are very good and mostly have good flavor. There are very recipes that are unappealing, such as creamed turkey or various casseroles.<br />I also found very problems. The pictures at the top of page 312 are backwards. The section on apple pie says that granny smiths are both good and not good for pies. I found only a couple of hints that do not work, such as using ice cubes to de-fat chicken stock.<br />The most valuable part of the book is the suggested list of kitchen equipment and pantry items. If you follow them, you will have a very well supplied kitchen, and it is the most complete list I can recall seeing anywhere.	2003-12-30

It is a valuable resource for those who are thinking about to or just beginning to make baking and pastry a career. I found it a very useful collection of advice and stories about the professional and practical aspects of pastry as a job.<br />Everyone who is going to culinary school for baking and pastry or who has recently graduated, as well as those in apprenticeships and other types of training, should read this book. To me, it is an indispensable vocational guide. Even those who are going into food and not pastry per se should read this, since cooperation between the savory and sweet kitchen is essential these days in restaurants.<br />This book is written by the executive pastry chef of the Coyote Cafe, and mostly it contains his opinions and viewpoints. It also has quotes from many famous and successful pastry professionals. Just so you can keep track, the book has brief biographies of the 30 or so professionals who are quoted throughout the text, many of whom you will recognize.<br />It contains the following chapters: History of Sweets (a mostly worthless re-hash of familiar material); Origins of Inspiration (childhood memories and early career experiences); Foundations of Learning (culinary schools, apprenticeships, and training); Inside the World of the Pastry Chef (what it is like under various conditions); Ingredients of Success (ingredients and menus); Traditions, Trends, Future (thumb-sucking chapter containing thoughts about the future of the pastry chef).<br />It also contains 4 dozen or so dessert recipes. Sadly, these are modern, new-fangled variations and recipes. They are more interesting for their creativity than as good recipes that you will want as part of your repertoire. As with all trendy recipes, these will be mostly out of date within a couple of years.  A few recipes are very good, such as Apple Apple Apple or Buchteln, and there is a handy index of recipes in the beginning, which good since they are randomly scattered throughout the book. Most, however, are interesting for some of the sub-recipes, like tangerine sorbet or pina colada sauce.<br />My main complaint is about the quotes he uses. The author has a stellar array of great pastry chefs (Emily Luchetti and Nancy Silverton to name just 2), but they are limited to just brief snippets of a few sentences. It would have been more illuminating to have extended quotes from them, so you could get a clear idea of their ideas, attitudes and opinions. As is, the text is mostly the author with a few quotes thrown in here and there, which is not as informative as it could be.<br />The greatest failing, however, is the idealized picture it presents.  It does not warn the prospective professional about long hours, hard work, drudgery, routine, smelly clothes and underwear and hair, tempermental bosses, and low pay.  The true satisfaction and delight of the job of pastry chef is also mostly absent.are randomly scattered throughout the book.

The author is a professional baker, and this book is very good collection of recipes. Due to the incomplete/wrong recipe procedures, however, I advice you to avoid this one.<br />When it comes to ingredients, there are several errors. Cocoa powder is usually not 25% cocoa butter (though it can be; American ones tend to be 10-20%). USDA grade A eggs are hard to find in my area, but AA eggs can be substituted without problem, though the author does say anything about this. &quot;Unbleached flour&quot; is not 14% protein; he is probably thinking of bread flour. The advice to line baking pans with wax paper is bad; sometimes you can do it, but it depends on the brand; it is better to use just parchment paper (if you do not have it and do baking, then you need to buy some before you do any more baking). Several recipes require peanut butter, but he does not state if he is using salted or unsalted; the taste of the final product changes dramatically depending on which one you use.<br />The procedures for the recipes are also problematic. Many recipes require folding, but the author does not have a description on how to do this critical step.  He sometimes advices adding liquid to &quot;reach the desired frosting consistency&quot;, but does not say what this means. His pound cake recipe is the goofy one that uses a French meringue (even though he does not say so, that is what the recipe is attempting to describe). His instructions for melting chocolate are not detailed enough for the beginning home cook. He says to bake several recipes to a &quot;moist crumb&quot;, but never describes what this means. Sacher torte should never be refrigerated. The instructions on baking a Dacquoise (meringue disk) are too vague. Ganaches and puddings that use cream should never be stored at room temperature overnight; either use them that day, refrigerate them (they can always be warmed up to soften the next day), or throw them out. The recipe for Rigo Jansci is missing a step, and also uses a non-standard size jelly roll pan, and the author does not state how to convert the recipe amounts to a standard size. Tart crusts that have chocolate are almost impossible to tell if they are &quot;lightly browned&quot; by just looking at it, and the author does not give an alternate method of testing doneness.  Chocolate Walnut Torte filling is a caramel, but the author does not give adequate instructions or precautions for this dangerous step.<br />It contains chapters on: old fashioned cakes, miscellaneous sweets (including a couple of candy recipes), european things (my personal favorite chapter), recipes that made the author a famous caterer (some of these I plan to put into my personal private repetoire), and soda fountain treats (the most valuable, as the author was a soda jerk at the legendary and now defunct Blum's). It contains many of my personal favorits, like rocky road and a chocolate cake that you mix right in the baking pan (look, ma, no dishes!).<br />In the end, I like this collection of recipes very much. The ones I tried were very good, and there were only a couple of outright failures. Because the instructions are not reliable, however, I recommend that you avoid this book.  If you are an experienced home baker or professional, then go ahead and get it; the mistakes the author makes are fairly obvious and easy to correct.  You will also end up with a paperback book filled with many recipes that you will want to try.Rigo Jansci is missing a step, and also uses a non-standard size jelly roll pan, and the author does not state how to convert the recipe amounts to a standard size.

Chocolate Walnut Torte filling is a caramel, but the author does not give adequate instructions or precautions for this dangerous step.<br />It contains chapters on: old fashioned cakes, miscellaneous sweets (including a couple of candy recipes), european things (my personal favorite chapter), recipes that made the author a famous caterer (some of these I plan to put into my personal private repetoire), and soda fountain treats (the most valuable, as the author was a soda jerk at the legendary and now defunct Blum's). It contains many of my personal favorits, like rocky road and a chocolate cake that you mix right in the baking pan (look, ma, no dishes!).<br />In the end, I like this collection of recipes very much. The ones I tried were very good, and there were only a couple of outright failures. Because the instructions are not reliable, however, I recommend that you avoid this book.  If you are an experienced home baker or professional, then go ahead and get it; the mistakes the author makes are fairly obvious and easy to correct.  You will also end up with a paperback book filled with many recipes that you will want to try.	2003-11-08
US	50042615	R9BCLS1NDUWL2	0688162983	910884943	Celebrate with Chocolate: Totally Over-the-Top Recipes	Books	3	37	47	N	Y	Whimsical Desserts	I use the word &quot;whimsical&quot; in the negative sense, as something amusing, unusual, or humorous that most people will not be interested in. So it is with Desaulnier's recent cookbook of &quot;totally over-the-top recipes&quot; (to be fair, though, they are not as outrageous as in some other books). In the end, I suggest that you steer clear of it.<br />One can criticize this book on several grounds, but the most serious involve the recipe instructions.  Almost all of them contain at least a few parts that are either incomplete or downright wrong. This is rather disappointing, as the author has a facility dubbed &quot;Ganache Hill&quot; that is devoted to testing recipes for his cookbooks. For example, his instructions for making an Italian meringue (&quot;Honey, I'm on Cloud Nine&quot; Icing) are too vague for this rather tricky procedure. The eggs for Schnappy Chocolate Cake did not whip properly. The cake layers for his version of Black Forest Cake should be soaked with syrup just before you assemble the cake, not just before you store it the refrigerator (they will get soggy and impossible to handle, I think). The author also states that the flour is &quot;pre-sifted&quot;, yet he calls for the flour to be sifted after measurement; he also makes the mistake of not giving weight measurements for flour.  One of the cookie recipes ends up as batter rather than a dough, and spread too much on the cookie sheet.<br />Another objection involves his use of non-standard baking pans: you will need a bewildering array of them, and it is unlikely that you will have any of the; you will have to purchase them specially for a specific recipe. You will also need 2 ovens to bake off the three half-sheet pans (10 x 15) for &quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Christmas Tree Stump&quot;; all the batter must be baked off right away, and cannot be stored while you bake one or two sheet pans. You will also need a true jelly roll pan, and three 9-inch cake pans, rather than the usual two. You will also need some disposable gloves, as some recipes require you to manipulate doughs that are very sticky.<br />Also note that a large stand mixer is required. There are no alternate instructions for either hand-held mixers or using a plain hand whisk.  The times given for the mixer are also rather problematic, as he gives just an amount of time in minutes, which is fine if have the same mixer he has. There are insufficient indications in the recipes as to what to look for when executing a step using the mixer; &quot;until soft&quot; is not an adequate instruction.<br />Another problem I encountered is that some of the recipes are either time consuming or difficult to execute properly, as many of them rely on expert decorative touches. There are no indications in the recipes to alert you to this. The unwary home baker can easily stumble into a recipe that is either beyond his/her scope or available time.<br />On the plus side, there are a couple of recipes that are valuable to have.  &quot;She Ain't Heavy&quot; Chocolate Cake is one of the richest and chocolate-laden I have tasted, and plan to keep as part of my repertoire of standard recipes (although it shrinks quite a bit when it cools). You will also find a recipe for a whole-egg butter sponge cake, also known as a genoise, flavored with chocolate: Old-World Cocoa Sponge Cake. While this is a standard professional recipe, it is also a valuable recipe for the home baker. There is also a rare recipe for homemade marshmallows; I found the flavor a little too intense compared to the one I usually use (the one in the old version the Joy of Cooking).ou will also need some disposable gloves, as some recipes require you to manipulate doughs that are very sticky.  <br />Also note that a large stand mixer is required.

US	50042615	R3CX0TLAFKS74S	0316496987	450614938	The Dessert Bible	Books	4	16	16	N	N	The Curious Baker	This is one of the most interesting cookbooks I have ever read. There is much here to criticize, but there is much more to admire. All things considered, this book is a valuable addition to your bookshelf.<br />The main problem here is the title of the book. It should be called a Baking Bible, because it covers all the major areas of baking, including cakes, pies, cookies, custards, frosting, tarts, souffl&eacute;s, puddings, and ice cream. The word &quot;dessert&quot; I do not think conveys the proper comprehensiveness of this cookbook.<br />Another rather irritating problem is that the recipes are unusually finicky. They have more steps and are more involved than most other recipes. There are extra instructions and steps you usually will not find elsewhere. The author also adjusts standard recipes to suit his own tastes. For example, he often cuts back the amount of sugar, but when I do them, I have to add the sugar back to get the &quot;right&quot; taste.  He likes chewy brownies, but when I did the recipe, the texture sort of reminded me of that colored modeling clay we played with when we were kids. So, when you do one of the recipes, make sure you read the header information so you know what he is changing and why. Also, since he is fiddling around with standard recipes, some of them no longer, strictly speaking, qualify for the classic definitions. The frozen lemon souffl&eacute;, for example, belongs in the chapter with the Bavarian cream (since that is what it is, regardless of the name).<br />On the other hand, your chance of success when doing any of the recipes is very high. The author has a good feel for what works and what does not, and also what the average home cook is and is not capable of. Note that some of the recipes are difficult, and have some touchy steps; however, he always clearly notes these steps. Of more importance, he clearly indicates how to tell when something is done and ready to be taken off the stove or out of the oven (you cannot cook by the clock); this by itself is worth the price of admission. My personal pet peeve about cookbooks in general is that the souffl&eacute; recipes usually do not work; the author does an admirable job of demystifying the process. All this makes for recipes that are very long and have a lot of explanatory material, which can be daunting to the average home cook.<br />The most interesting feature of this book is the extensive recipe testing that the author documents. Have you ever wondered what would happen to various recipes if you change the amounts or type of ingredients? How about trying to improve a specific recipe? The author has done all things, and you can read about them. For most recipes, there is an accompanying essay about the search for the proper recipe. This gives the amateur chef plenty of grist for the mill. Whenever I need a recipe, I usually reach for this book first. It is the most used book of my cookbook collection, because I know that the recipes work as specified by the author. It is also an excellent learning tool. When I need to know something (for example, why my pot de cr&egrave;me recipe from another cookbook did not work), this is the book I reach for. Besides: the material relating to the author's tests are extremely interesting and fun to read about; this is one of my favorite cookbooks.lock); this by itself is worth the price of admission.

However, I am unsure of the reliability of some of the recipes. They do not all work as printed in the book. Second, there is a problem with the measurements used, eg. &quot;rounded soup spoon of sugar&quot; or &quot;half mustard glass of cream&quot;. There are metric equivalents for these in the front of the book, however, but it seems rather odd. Third, the book usually calls for &quot;chocolat noir&quot;, or dark chocolate. It is unclear exactly what kind this is equivalent to in the US, but I am assuming that a 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate is referred to (this is what I used, and flavor seemed to be correct). Fourth, there is a picture of a chocolate glaze on p. 41 with way too many bubbles on the cake (this is probably due to using a whisk rather than a spatula to mix the glaze). This is acceptable in the home, but not professionally. I wonder how many other similar problems there are in the text undetected by my limited french abilities.<br />On the positive side, there are some very good recipes, viz granite au chocolat amer de Michel Guerard, and chocolat a l'eau (hot chocolate that is simply chocolate dissolved in how water-no sugar, no milk, just chocolate).	2003-09-22

The bi-monthly magazine Cooks Illustrated has a column it calls &quot;Quick Tips&quot;; it is a collection of handy tips and tricks in the kitchen, many of which will make your life easier. This book is a well chosen collection of 365 of these tips.<br />Every tip has an illustration, even those that do not really need one. For those (like me) who do not subscribe to this magazine regularly, a collection of these valuable tips is nice to have. Even those who do subscribe will find it useful, as all the tips are alphabetized. The kitchen jobs that are the most troublesome, such as pies and cakes, each yield several tips.<br />On the other hand, this is a rather randow collection of tips.

Home made pies are rare these days, so I am glad to have a new book with nothing but recipes for apple pies, 100 in all. Strictly speaking, some of the recipes are not pies, but close relatives.<br />I like this cookbook very much. I appreciate the simple, direct instructions. I did not have any real problems with the recipes I tried. Note that the author prefers streusel toppings over the traditional 2-crust pie. I find the instructions to remove a blazing hot, half-baked pie out of the oven and pressing toppings onto it with your hands dangerous and not advisable. The author has not solved the problem of a giant air gap under the top crust of a baked pie; he sidesteps the issue by usually recommending a streusel topping, to be applied halfway through baking. The author also lives in the northeast, so much of his comments about different apple varieties apply to those not usually available on the west coast.<br />On the other hand, there are a few missing elements, which is rather surprising for a book that is essentially only one recipe with 99 variations. One would expect some hints and problems that relate to most of the recipes in the book, yet none are forthcoming. Since all the recipes have apples, one would also expect an extended section about apples: seasons, different types, which to choose for which recipe, typical characteristics, etc. However, the information about apples is perfunctory. It should also have a section on preparing apples, rolling the crust, and how to flute the edges (some information on this does finally appear on p. 81 in an easily overlooked sidebar), but this information is mostly lacking; there are a few tips hopelessly scattered in random portions of the text where you will never find them when you need them. Information on slicing apples appears in a side bar on page 41. It would be helpful to have some sort of cross reference to tell you which recipe is best for different apples, for those who come home from the market with a bagful of a particular type of apple in peak season. I also object to the organization: the recipes are grouped into chapters, but the groupings do not make much sense. More disturbingly, all the ingredients are listed in volume measure, but do not include weight equivalents. The author lists flour amounts in cups only, but does describe what method he uses to fill the measuring cups (dip and sweep, spooning, sifting, etc.). The apple amounts are usually listed in cups of cut up apples; this is unfortunate, as one buys apples by the piece or pound, not by the cupful, in the market. The author does not supply equivalents or conversions.<br />All in all, I enjoy having such a large number of recipes for just one thing: apple pies, since I like them very much; you will never run out of new recipes to try. However, any single subject cookbook must be more than just 100 similar recipes jumbled together; it must also cover its subject and its aspects thoroughly and in depth.

The author has a little trouble pining it down, but it means high quality bread made by hand in small batches at modest, neighborhood bakeries, some of whom have gained international reputations.<br />I live in the San Francisco bay area, one of the homes of this new trend, so I was looking forward to this book. Sadly, this book tries to be four different things at the same time, and is not particularly good at any of them. The most charitable thing I can think of to say about this book is that it is an interesting introduction to the subject of artisan breads.<br />The first intended audience is the beginning bread baker. These beginning recipes are identified as such, but there is not enough information for the uninitiated to actually make these recipes.<br />The second audience is the experienced baker, and this is the most successful one. Everyone who has baked bread will find an interesting recipe that is within his ability. I found several that I was intrigued by and tried. Unfortunately, the recipes in this book are not that complete. On an interesting page, the author describes 5 different pre-ferments, but does not give exact recipes for them, or the most appropriate recipes to use them in. When I tried some of the recipes in summer, many of the doughs fermented faster than the times given in the recipes and over-proofed (I halted fermentation before it happened, and this may have affected the flavor, but what I got was very good). This may not necessarily be a fatal flaw, but only an experienced baker can make them work under typical and variable home conditions.  On the positive side, the author is an experienced baker and educator, and has done a good job of translating professional recipes into ones suitable for the home.<br />The third is as a coffee table book. The format is a large 9x12, but there are not enough pictures for this book to qualify as such, and many of the pictures included are neither interesting nor informative.<br />The last is an account of the best recipes and bakers the author found while traveling across America. The ones included are interesting enough, but the number of people/places/types covered is surprising small.<br />The book has the following chapters: Baking Basics, Starting With Flour (simpler, plain breads suitable for beginners; some recipes are based on fermented poolish), Crafting Bread (fermented, sourdough-type breads), Specialty Breads (rye, pizza, pandoro, bialy, etc.), The Baking Life (holiday breads, along with some interesting accounts of baking as a vocation), and miscellaneous references.ncluded are neither interesting nor informative.<br />The last is an account of the best recipes and bakers the author found while traveling across America.

French cakes have little in common with American ones.  Like its predecessors on pastry and cookies, this baking book on cakes is about the types that you will find in classic, pastry shops in France, and not their American cousins.  It is also aimed at the serious amateur pastry chef, not the casual home baker. If you are looking for a book to tell you how to make and decorate a chocolate birthday cake for your children, this is not the book for you.<br />French cakes are both simple and very complicated; they are also amazing and can be heavenly like nothing else in patisserie that comes in a bewildering array of choices. Simply, a French cake is a cake base cut into layers flavored with syrup, sometimes with a flavoring agent between the layers, a filling and frosting of buttercream (but can also be flavored whipped cream, meringue, etc.), plus many decorative touches. The cake bases used are few in number and not that difficult to make. With simple variations in flavoring and decorations, the cake becomes totally different in taste and appearance.  So, once you learn how to make one type of cake, you also know how to make at least a dozen other, totally different cakes. This book is a more or less complete guide for making most of the important, popular varieties of French cakes. I should also note that many of these cakes are ones that Americans will actively dislike. For example, succ&egrave;s brushed with flavored syrup is a French favorite, but is also a sugary, chewy, soggy thing that the average American will probably spit out with the first bite.<br />The organization is logical and also rather sophisticated. Each chapter starts out with a thorough description of a basic technique, and all the recipes in that chapter are based on that technique. For most recipes, you will also need procedures and recipes in other parts of the book, but the author always gives the page number to go to. The chapters are also arranged from easy ones to the more sophisticated ones; it assumes that you will proceed through the book sequentially, and not skip around. The chapters are: Simple Cakes, Round Sponge Cake Gateaux, Round Nut Meringue Gateaux, Meringues, Rectangular Gateaux, Bavarians (also Charlottes and Mousse Cakes), Logs and Leaves, Filling and Frostings, Finishing Touches, Basic Preparations, and a hundred or so pages of reference information. This is definitely not your mother's cake book (unless she grew up in France).<br />Sadly, making and decorating French cakes is difficult to do properly, and requires patience and practice. It will probably take you several tries to become successful at any one recipe. The techniques described in this book are very similar to professional ones, and, rightly speaking, are the only way you will have a chance.  They have done a good job of describing these professional practices and explaining to the amateur chef how to do them. If you pay attention to what the author says and practice, you will succeed. I do have a few quibbles here and there (potato starch did not seem to improve the pound cake recipes; a flat icing spatula will not lay down an even layer of buttercream inside a cake ring; I find American cake circles to be perfectly acceptable, but have never used or seen a French one), but the information is reliable and of the highest caliber.er to go to.

The key to this book is the word &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, and the absence of the word &quot;cookbook&quot; in the title. As a glossy coffee table book, it is barely adequate; as a cookbook full of chocolate recipes, it is worthless. Much of the material in this book has been recycled from an equally reprehensible book &quot;Chocolate Ecstasy&quot;.<br />The first part of this book is a rather standard (and forgettable) regurgitation about chocolate: history, processing, taste, commercial brands, and physiology. By and large, this is standard material cribbed mostly from other books. It only has value if you have not read other books about chocolate.<br />If you approach this book as a coffee table book full of glossy, beautiful pictures, it is not all that good. Many pictures (perhaps up to 1/3, but I did not really count) are of poor quality and have a rust-colored tinge to them (whether this is from the printing, badly lit photos, or whatever, I do not know).<br />The recipes are so short and inadequate as to be laughable. Many complex, difficult recipes are casually tossed off in half a dozen sentences. The recipe instructions seemed to have been carefully edited down to make sure that each recipe plus photos takes up exactly one page (heaven forbid should a recipe occupy 2 pages). The mistakes, errors, and editorial inconsistencies are so numerous as to be not worth listing here (for example, there is no such thing as a &quot;33 x 13 x 9-inch jelly roll pan&quot;, or a &quot;30 x 12 x 8 inch jelly roll pan&quot;). The recipes clearly have not been through a test kitchen, and the author uses a bewildering array of non-standard baking pans (unless these, too, are typographical errors; with this book, it is hard to be sure).<br />If you are curious about how those elegant chocolate desserts are created, then this book will satisfy your curiosity. Every recipe starts with a picture (something I wish more cookbooks about chocolate would emulate), gives you the ingredients, and a rough description about the steps involved to make it.<br />If you want good recipes that you can do in your home kitchen, look elsewhere. The rating I give is as a coffee table book, not as a cookbook; as a cookbook, I would give a much lower rating. The kindest thing I can think of to say about this book is that it is a fairly interesting collection of recipes that will have you rifling through your other chocolate cookbooks, looking for a similar recipe.about chocolate would emulate), gives you the ingredients, and a rough description about the steps involved to make it. <br />If you want good recipes that you can do in your home kitchen, look elsewhere.

This happy little book contains nothing but recipes for sorbets (which must be made in an ice cream machine) and granitas (which can be made in a home freezer) from this cafe. I have never been there, but I am glad to have their recipes for these icy, fruity, delightful treats (especially the coffee/chocolate one).<br />Basically, these things are nothing more than fruit juice/puree, sugar, ice, and maybe a bit of flavoring (liqueur, vanilla, etc.). They have no fat, although they are rather caloric due to the sugar.<br />There are 15 sorbet recipes, 14 for granitas, 11 for matching sauces, 10 for matching cookies, and 3 garnishes. It is a classic example of single subject cookbook that covers its subject extremely well; it is quite unique, as I do not know of another one that is exclusively devoted this subject.<br />The granita and sauce recipes I tried were all very good. I cannot tell you about sorbet, because I do not have an ice cream machine. Some of the granitas are a little too sweet for me, so I had to cut back the sugar a couple of times. The section that reviews ice cream machines is too brief. The sabayon recipes are not the traditional, but ones containing whipped cream; they are rich and delicious, but also very high in calories and fat.

Sadly, this one is riddled with errors and not really suitable for much of anything.<br />It has the following chapters: All About Baking, Breads, Cookies, Main and Side Dishes, Desserts, Baking with Kids, and Holidays. The chapter on main dishes is rather out of place and inexplicable. The term &quot;baking&quot; usually implies desserts and sweets, not roast pork or polenta. The American usage of the word &quot;baking&quot; ordinarily does not include savory cooking besides bread.<br />The impetus behind this book is a versatile, wide-ranging collection of over 350 recipes that can be done by busy families, some members of which may not have a lot culinary skill or very much time. In that, it succeeds admirably. The recipes, for the most part, are simple and easy to do, and not time consuming nor difficult.  While it has its share of frumpy, unappealing recipes like noodle casseroles, there is enough variety and interesting recipes to keep you occupied for a very long time.  For example, the section on bread machines has so many interesting recipes that I want to convert several of them into ordinary bread recipes that can be done without the machine (Garlic-Basil Bread and Cherry-Almond Loaf, to name just two). It even has a special section of recipes designed just for children to do. The index of recipes at the beginning of each chapter is especially useful.<br />This book also has numerous errors and badly written recipes, which is rather surprising considering the source; one would ordinarily expect impeccable editing and proofreading. Several pictures are mislabeled (pp. 79, 58, 69, 233, 235). Some recipes contain typographical errors (pp. 43, 168, 183, 192, 194, 238, 402). Finally, a surprising 22 recipes have instructions that are either incomplete or not satisfactory for the average home cook. For example, several cake recipes instruct you to fill and frost a cake; this instruction is fine for experienced bakers who have done this before and already know how to do it, but not sufficient for the beginner.<br />I also object to the section &quot;Baking with Kids&quot;. It does mark certain steps in recipes &quot;adult help&quot;, an alert to children to get adult assistance, but this warning is not used often enough to make me feel safe about letting a child do these recipes, even under close and constant adult supervision. It warns both children and adults about the danger of sharp knives and electrical appliances, but these steps do not have any warnings on them in the recipes themselves. Also, it does not warn children or the adults about the most dangerous part of baking: the proper method of removing blazing hot pans from the oven, and appropriate steps and warnings.<br />Were it not for the omissions and errors, this would be a wonderful family cookbook. I do not recommend this book: the beginner will run into too many problems, and the experienced cook will find most of the recipes elementary and rather ordinary.uction is fine for experienced bakers who have done this before and already know how to do it, but not sufficient for the beginner.  <br />I also object to the section &quot;Baking with Kids&quot;.

US	50042615	R1MESWVW1DDG5U	0811824462	931236076	Sweet Miniatures: The Art of Making Bite-Size Desserts	Books	4	17	17	N	N	Good Things in Small Packages	I like this &quot;little&quot; baking book very much.  It is an entire book dedicated to the magic art of petit-fours, or small, french, bite-sized bits of desserts and sweets. There are some books on the subject, mostly professional.  However, here is a simple, easy to follow book ideal for the home baker to make these wonderful little things.<br />The author has been a successful caterer for many years.  She knows what is easy to make, and are also very popular things that people just love.  Here is a collection of those recipes that meet both requirements.  It is a baking book you will probably use very often. Be warned, however, that these wonderful little gems are very labor intensive. You will be slaving over the proverbial hot stove for rather long perions of time per recipe.  Multiply that by three or four recipes, and it all adds up to a very long time. Fortunately, the author supplies proven, time-saving organizational tips in the last chapter. I also note that her hints and suggestions for decoration can be skimpy at times; decorating things this small is not an easy task.<br />My complaints are mostly organizational.  Several basics, like cake or crust recipes, are used in multiple recipes, but are buried in the middle of chapters or embedded in one particular recipe.  These should always be the first recipe in the relevant chapter on their own, or given a separate chapter by themselves. Also helpful would be a cross reference chart, so that one glance will tell you how many different petit-fours you can make with the same basic cake or crust recipe. It does have some charts at the end, but these are not organized by the base recipe. There are some pictures, and each one tells you what page the recipe is on; however, the reverse is not true: a recipe may have a picture, but you won't know it unless you check the pictures each time.	2003-07-06

The author has been the director of a test kitchen.  The dust jacket has a number of glowing reviews by respected authors of baking cookbooks.  The object of this book was to capture and preserve all those old-fashioned, classic desserts that should never be forgotten.  The author claims to have done extensive testing of all the centuries of recipes from old cookbooks and grandmothers' recipe boxes, and presents only the best ones in each subject.  Sadly, the result is a below average collection of baking recipes.<br />The recipes are something less than classic.  Most of the recipes are new-age &quot;twists&quot; on old classics. The author has a penchant for the unusual and off-beat (if I were less charitable, I would call his taste downright weird). He does not have recipes for the original pound cake (even his quatre-quarts is an oddball version using stiff egg whites), nor a straight, plain apple pie. His historical research was apparently not thorough, as he does not include recipe for one of the original fruit desserts: gooseberry fool (the chapters on fresh fruit desserts are the least objectionable in my opinion).  Plus, his testing does not appear to have been thorough: for example, the recipe for Espresso-Cinnamon Ice Cream has a brewing time for the coffee that is way too long. It is also important to note that a food processor and large, stand mixer are required for most (perhaps as much as two-thirds; I didn't really count) recipes.<br />On the positive side, I liked the recipe for Frozen Cappuccino (don't ask me for another recipe I really liked, as I couldn't find one).  He is also the only cookbook author I am aware of who has read Apicius, Varenne, Câreme, and Francatelli.  The most valuable part of the book is the bibliography, which has an amazing list of historical sources that the author found at the New York Public Library.	2003-06-27

The author is a representative of the wheat industry, so the emphasis here is on bread products and the various varieties of wheat that are available.  The most interesting feature are the sections diagnosing various production problems and their causes and solutions.<br />The dust jacket says that the book is good for both small and large baking operations, but the ingredient chapter is more relevant to a large operation rather than the neighborhood bakery.  The production chapter is more suited to large scale applications and under-developed countries.  The emphasis is on low per-unit cost and high through-put processes.  As such, it is more apropos to the wholesale bakery operation rather than the neighborhood bake shop.  The author often emphasizes quantity and convenience over quality and taste.  As such, it is more suitable to wholesale bakery operations rather than the local bake shop or the bakery student, statements in the appendix not withstanding.<br />I do not have the necessary experience to judge the value of the recipes for either production dor learning purposes.  However, the book seems to be meant as an all-purpose reference to sit on the shelf of a large, wholesale bakery rather than a study manual or a source to develope new baking procedures and recipes.  For example, there is little distinction in the recipes for French, Italian, and Viennese loaf breads; they seem to assume an on-going baking procedure that needs assistance.  It is more of a supplementary text to aid on-going production rather than a collection of basic techniques and procedures.  As such, I am not sure of its value as learning tool for the student, statements in the Appendices not withstanding. As a learning tool, it is inadequate.  As a reference book, it is, I guess, acceptable.<br />It is a 5th edition, but I found an unusually large number of editorial mistakes. There is &quot;poor&quot; rather than pour (p.445), p. 524 has &quot;sufficient&quot; instead of &quot;insufficient&quot;, &quot;fold&quot; rather than hold, and the cakes chapter page headers are incorrect (has &quot;common problems with fruit cakes&quot; on top of brownie and cheescake sections).  The author mistakenly states that increased acidity in the dough increases or strengthens the pH.  In fact, it is the opposite: increasing acidity decreases the pH.  Alkali, like baking soda, has a very high pH.  In the international version of the recipes, the % of flour sometimes is and sometimes is not listed as 100%.  He also states that there are &quot;hard&quot; cheddar cheeses versus the softer, grated &quot;American-type&quot;, which seems to be a meaningless distinction.<br />The coverage of pastry and cakes is perfunctory at best. It is aimed at the professional baker, and is certainly not recommendable for the home baker.  The book seems to have been designed as a textbook.  As such, it is more useful as a resource rather than a tutorial, which is perfectly acceptable if this book is used along with a production manual as part of a professional course in baking.  Its primary audience is experience bakers who need a reference book.ot;poor&quot; rather than pour (p.445), p. 524 has &quot;sufficient&quot; instead of &quot;insufficient&quot;, &quot;fold&quot; rather than hold, and the cakes chapter page headers are incorrect (has &quot;common problems with fruit cakes&quot; on top of brownie and cheescake sections).

US	50042615	R22ET2RP1YKM45	0767906071	893599654	Chocolate Cake	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Chocolate Cake for Dummies	This is an excellent book for those who like to make chocolate cakes but may not be a skilled, experienced baker.  If you are an average person who is trying to bake that chocolate cake at home, then I can happily recommend this book.<br />The most important feature of this book is that all recipes are rated according to difficulty.  Those who are beginners can choose easy recipes, while those who are already adept at angel food cakes and butter cream frostings can go directly for the complicated ones.  Bakers of all abilities will be able to find a recipe that fits your skill level.  For example, she correctly identifies French butter cream frostings as difficult.  Other recipes that are impressive and seem to be hard are actually easy to do, and this book will rate them as such.<br />This book has a lot going for it besides the rating system.  The first 50 pages or so give you just the right amount of information so you can do the recipes.  It is also very good about telling you what kind of equipment you will need for the various recipes.  The recipes are clear and easy to follow most of the time.  It also has a good dissertation on various types of icings and frostings, and matching them up to various cakes.  The only short point here is the subject of matching up refrigerated versus cakes that can be stored at room temperature and what icings and frostings will match them.<br />There are a few problems, but they are minor.  The description of semisweet and bittersweet chocolate is not correct.  The statement that margarine can be substituted for baking in all recipes is also not correct, since the margarine can have wildly differing amounts of water that will have unpredictable results on any one recipe.  The author is a trained, professional baker.  This is often good, as the instructions are based on tried and true professional techniques that really work (which is sadly not true of many books about baking), but she often overestimates the abilities of beginner bakers.  The vocabulary can have professional terms or techniques not otherwise explained, and the difficulty rating of some of the recipes should be increased; for example, anything that involves whipping and folding egg whites should be intermediate, not easy.nner bakers.

The author has spent a lot of time (years in fact) testing and developing recipes for this book.  All of the results are contained in this baking cookbook, in glorious and extensive detail.  There is so much information, in fact, that it is difficult even for the experienced baker to wade through so much information and detail.  It contains everything you could possibly want to know, and a whole lot more.<br />If you like the Cake Bible, you will love this one about pies and pastries.  It is just as complete and thorough.  If you a serious home baker, you will find this cookbook indispensable.  If you are a professional baker, it is an excellent resource; for example, she describes half a dozen very saleable Danish pastries from the same dough.  For the rest of us, however, I must cast a disapproving eye.  I doubt that the average home cook will be able to successfully pick his/her way through the material in this cookbook.<br />Like its predecessor (for which, see) on cakes, it is extremely finicky.  It contains an astonishing 75 pages just on pie and tart crusts.  The procedures for the former involve an unusual process that makes the dough in a zip lock plastic bag. The recipes are so long and complete, that it is easy to get lost while following the recipes, since this involves quite a bit of jumping around in the text. Also, the layout of the ingredient table is not always clear: some recipes have multiple components, and the division between them in the ingredients' table is not always clear just by looking at them (often, you have to read the recipes to see where the divisions are). The pictures have page numbers for the matching recipes, but the recipes do not have page numbers for the matching pictures.<br />It does have some nice touches. The ingredient lists both volume and weight, leaving not doubt as to the correct amounts. There is a brief but enlightening exposition on the similarities of puff pastry, croissant, Danish, brioche, strudel, and fillo. The chapter on Equipment has many useful tools and insights not found elsewhere.<br />On the down side, there are a few editing mistakes: on page 204 there is a reference to page 627 (the correct page is 672), the Creamy and Spicy Crab Tartlets does not list a substitute for tobanjan, the ancho chile powder for Baked Empanadas can be bought premade, the directions for roasting bell peppers for Roasted Red Pepper and Poblano Quiche could be better, Love for Three Oranges says not to use Seville orange zest but a subsidiary recipe she calls for this exact ingredient, the instructions for slicing salmon for Coulibiac needs a diagram, the duxelle mixture for Beef Wellington probably does not require the listed 60 minutes, a proof box for Whole Wheat Croissants can be made easier by simply inverting a large cardboard box over the dough, and the chapter on Ingredients needs to be re-edited and re-organized with more titles (for example, vanilla is in the Thickeners section, but does not appear in the index, gold leaf appears under the Gelatin section and is not listed in the index either). Also, a more detailed Table of Contents would make this book a much more valuable reference.  For these reasons, I recommend waiting for a second edition of this book that (hopefully) will have these mistakes corrected.<br />Like the real Bible, it contains a mountain of information of which only a tiny portion will ever be used, but will be used extensively.  If you are developing recipes for publication, or one of those people who supplies all of the pies to the county fair, then this book is for you: an extensive and reliable manual for the assembly line production of baked goods.  For the average home cook, I suspect that this book is a little too much.  It is, however, a welcome reference to the troublesome task of baking and pastries.  They say that one can never have toomuch information, but in this case, I am not so sure.  On the other hand, your chances of success following these recipes are very high.ve too much information, but in this case, I am not so sure.

The first part is yet another cooking encyclopedia, and the second is a conventional collection of very good recipes.<br />The author states correctly that there is no real source for all of the information used in baking, even if you have professional training.  So, the first part of this book is a comprehensive reference work, which is both good and bad.  Tools and techniques occupy almost 90 pages, and ingredients take an amazing 300 pages. On the good side, it is very complete. Some sections are ones where the author has extensive personal experience, and are exemplary, such as the ones on garnishing and fresh fruits.  It also has many useful tables.  On the down side, the author seems to be cribbing from standard encyclopedias and manufacturers' literature for much of this section; this is true of perhaps as much as half of this section.  Plus, I have doubts about whether the author tested ALL of the combinations listed in the &quot;Ingredient Substitution Chart&quot; or &quot;Flavour Pairing Chart&quot;.  I also have minor quibbles with some of the information, viz: nutmeg and mace are different, but as a practical matter they are interchangeable (in fact, nutmeg is listed as a substitute for mace, but it also works the other way around); a whole Madagascar vanilla bean is worth more than 2 teaspoons-the correct amount is closer to 2 tablespoons.  There is also at least one editing error: page 445 states &quot;see page xx&quot;.<br />The 300 page recipe section, however, more than makes up for deficiencies in the reference section. It contains 150 recipes, of which there are very few &quot;throw away&quot; recipes that you will never use. Too many cookbooks have recipes that are either rehashes from other cookbooks (in which case you can actually trace the evolution of a recipe from one cookbook to another), or weird and outlandish variations of recipes that are not worth doing or simply do not work.  In this case, it is a collection of both standard recipes and the author's own creations. The emphasis here is on flavor and not elegant or architectural presentations. For example, sauces and garnishes often have the same flavor as the cake or torte rather than a contrasting one; the result is flavor that is often better than the fancy desserts and sweets served at the best restaurants. The author has genuinely rethought the whole subject of baking, ingredients, and taste, and created a collection of recipes that are better than standard baking recipes. They range from traditional ones such as strawberry shortcake and macaroons, to the exotic, such as &quot;Valrhona Molten Chocolate Cakes&quot; and &quot;Lychee and Coconut Milk Sorbet&quot;.  The most useful chapter is the last one, &quot;Garnishes, Sauces, and Basic Recipes&quot;; it contains useful, all-purpose recipes.  In fact, it should be the first chapter in the recipe part of the book, as many recipes elsewhere in the book depend on the ones in this last chapter.<br />In summary, the reference section is a mixed lot, but the recipes are of the highest caliber.  It is not a book for beginners, but both home cooks and professionals will find it useful.that are not worth doing or simply do not work.

Yet, none really deserve the term.  They are never complete nor correct enough to warrant the title.  This book, however, has earned the rights to these words. It originally started out as a club for professional bakers to solve their common baking problems that metastasized into this baking cookbook.  It features many highly respected names such as Flo Braker, John Phillip Carroll, Marion Cunningham, Carol Field, Fran Gage, and Alice Medrich.  The whole thing is edited by Rick Rodgers.<br />I have often heard people, including many respected food writers, lament that there ought to be a comprehensive book about baking that covers all of the important aspects and types of recipes and techniques.  Well, here it is.  It delves into such arcana as: the differences between genoise, sponge cake, chiffon cake, and angel food cake; the proper way to measure flour (in fact, different chapters use different methods, so read the recipes carefully and follow them to the letter; similar comments apply to which rolling pin or what kind of flour to use); and 4 different recipes for pie dough using either lard, cream cheese, shortening, or butter.  The same applies to the chapter on tarts.  It starts out with 5 recipes for crusts (pate brisee, pate sablee, pate sucree, tartlet dough, and quick puff pastry), and the subsequent recipes for tarts start with one of one of the crusts. The chapter on yeast breads is especially noteworthy.<br />Each chapter is written by a different person, and functions as a self contained primer on a particular subject. Each subject is treated systematically and thoroughly. In fact, each chapter could be published on its own as reference work on its subject.  One chapter often contains more information than a standard cookbook on baking.  The chapters are: ingredients, tools, basic cakes, fancy cakes, pies, tarts, fruit desserts, cookies, muffins and quick breads, yeast breads, custards, and frostings.<br />There are 2 important features in this book that are absent from most others about baking.  First, all of the recipes are the result of extensive testing by the bakers (of which, incidentally, there are many more than just a baker's dozen or 13), and not just a &quot;traditional&quot; one someone habitually uses.  Second, all of the recipes are solid, old-fashioned favorites (like: brownies, biscuits, doughnuts, banana bread, apple pandowdy, pecan pie, cornbread) that have been staples of the family table for decades; there are no trendy recipes here for weird baked goods that you will never make.  On the down side, there are a couple of editing mistakes: p. 221 and 224 both refer to &quot;page 000&quot;.<br />If you can bake cakes from boxed mixes and make cookies from the recipe on the back of the package of chocolate chips, then you are ready for this book.  Even experienced bakers will learn much from the collective intelligence in this book.

The positive comments on the dust jacket that the recipes really work convinced me and I tried them. I was surprised when all of the recipes worked (the ones I tried, anyway). I now regularly make chocolate desserts from this book and freeze them. Being able to just take something rich and chocolaty from the freezer, thaw, and eat is something not to be missed.<br />Cookbooks written in the 1960's and 1970's used to routinely include instructions for saving and freezing the recipes. This is not true of recent cookbooks. This is a shame, as it a great labor saving technique. The home cook would make a spectacular dessert on a lazy Sunday afternoon or in lieu of a cancelled weekend activity, and freeze it for later use, mainly during the weekdays, when there is no time to properly bake a nice chocolate dessert (not to mention midnight raids for a snack). It is also an excellent way of preparing for parties and such. This book happily brings back this old-fashioned tradition our mothers used to practice regularly.<br />I find 2 factors in this book rather quirky. First, the author recommends melting chocolate in a warm oven, then turning up the heat for the baking. Better methods are the microwave (the author states that she does not have one) or in a double boiler. You also must have a large stand mixer; there are no alternate insturctions for doing the recipes manually.<br />There are some curious errors. This book should have been vetted by a test kitchen. Some of the recipes should involve the use of tempered chocolate (chocolate curls), yet no mention is made of how to temper chocolate or the use of vegetable oil based \\"summer coatings\\" (I skip these recipes; there are better ones for making and using tempered chocolate). Some of the recipes involve a dramatic visual presentation (chocolate-covered raspberry mousse mountain), yet there is no picture of the finished product. The instructions for freezing are not a part of the recipes, but are mentioned in sidebars, leaving the cook to guess as to how include the freezing instructions into the recipes. For the most part, this is not a problem, but it can lead to confusion in some recipes. They should have been integrated directly into recipes.a part of the recipes, but are mentioned in sidebars, leaving the cook to guess as to how include the freezing instructions into the recipes.

The next chapter traces the complete life cycle of chocolate, from seedling, to mature tree, fruit, harvest, drying, fermentation, shipment, factory processing, and transformation into chocolate bars.  The third chapter concentrates on the diversity of different cacao tree varieties, from criollo, to forasteros, to trinitarios.  The last chapter is a collection of recipes that were developed for specified brands of chocolate.<br />The main strength of this book is that it teaches the chocolate lover that it really does matter about the cacao beans, just as it matters with coffee beans or wine grapes.  Where was it grown? What variety is it? How was the fermentation and drying handled? Was it shipped properly? What types of beans were blended? What does the final product taste like? Is it high quality or just another mass-produced blend?<br />The flavor of chocolate varies all over the place, and one must know about the cacao beans it was produced from.  This book makes a strong case for the opinion that if the consumer does not demand better quality chocolate, the great producers of the world will not give it to them. I learned that the expensive \\"boutique\\" brands of chocolate (E Guittard and Scharffenberger to name only 2 local such companies) really are worth the extra money.  If nothing else, this book should raise the awareness of the chocoholic of the quality of the chocolate.  The good news is that the chocolate companies really are capable of producing superior quality chocolate if the consumer demands it.<br />On the whole, this book is a mixed lot.  It will inspire you to try all of the new, expensive \\"boutique\\" brands of chocolates.  The recipes are intriguing in concept, but rather ordinary; only a couple of the Mexican-inspired hot chocolates are of interest.  The most important part of this book is the list of resources listed in the back where you can learn about and buy all these chocolates.  Also listed are books, classes, and websites that are very valuable sources of information.<br />On the other hand, once you finish reading the book, it will then become just another coffee table book.

It is not a basic cookbook full of recipes for toll house cookies, fudgey brownies, or chocolate birthday cakes. It certainly is not a cookbook for the casual cook who wants to make a chocolate dessert for an informal Sunday dinner. It is a mostly reliable instruction manual for producing impressive and artistic chocolate creations.<br />This book is an excellent introduction to the fine art of chocolate patisserie. It will lead the motivated reader to produce elegant presentations, table centerpieces, etc. It will be a great advantage if the reader is already an accomplished home baker. If you are, the procedures can be successfully followed. The recipes and instructions are clear, and give you all of the detail and explanations you need. Do not be fooled, however: the recipes require time, patience, and lots of practice. In the end, you will be able to create products that can be sold at the local bakery, and you will be able to fool people into thinking that you are a professional pastry chef.<br />On the other hand, this book does have a few flaws. All the recipes depend on presentation and looks; therefore, all recipes should have a picture to show you what your end product should look like. Several recipes (including Mouse Truffles, Twig Basket, Teardrop Dessert Cups), however, do not have any pictures, and the reader is mostly clueless as what the recipe should look like. At one point, the author states that one should start with the easier projects. Unfortunately, none of the recipes are rated as to which ones are hard, and which are easy, nor is there a list of recommended recipes for beginners. Also, several procedures, such as chocolate roses and chocolate birds, describe fairly complex procedures, and need a series of detailed pictures to illustrate the steps described in the recipe, but none are forthcoming. The last chapter on basic recipes for cakes, frostings, and sauces should be the first chapter.<br />There are also a couple of interesting points. It is the only source I know of that has substitution lists for substituting cocoa powder or unsweetened chocolate for semisweet chocolate. It also is the only cookbook that consistently recommends chocolate substitutes when it is necessary and produces better results than ordinary chocolate.<br />The book contains the following sections: 1) Ingredients and Tools, 2) Melting and Tempering Chocolate, 3) Spectacular Chocolate Confections, 4) Chocolate Magic Tricks, 5) Spectacular Chocolate Gifts, 6) Spectacular Chocolate Cakes and Desserts, 7) Basic Cakes, Fillings, Frostings, and Sauces.<br />All things considered, it is an impressive instruction manual that is a reasonable substitute for taking a course in chocolate patisserie at the local JC or cooking school. If it had a few more pictures (like Jacques Pepin's \\"Complete Techniques) I would be happy to call it a textbook destined for immortality.<br />It should be noted that the author is a genuine chocolate expert.  She teaches master's classes and leads chocolate tours to the cacao plantations in central and south america.  She is not just another cookbook author who has decided to add a chocolate cookbook to her resume (which is a defect of several popular chocolate cookbooks, including  \\"Chocolate Ecstasy\\").r. <br />There are also a couple of interesting points.

Although there are a great many of them available, truly good ones are not that common.  Unfortunately, this book cannot be numbered among the good ones.  While it is a pretty decent collection of chocolate recipes, this cookbook has a few problems with it.<br />This cookbook is not for the average person trying to do some baking in his or her kitchen on a Sunday afternoon.  The majority of recipes require a fair amount of culinary skill to successfully execute.  Some of the recipes are fairly easy and can be done by anyone.  Unfortunately, the book does not warn the reader as to which ones are easy and which are more difficult.  Some of the recipes, especially the ones involving chocolate sculpture, are very advanced and require some near-professional skills in order to successfully finish.<br />Another problem is that of equipment.  You will need a kitchen well stocked with a wide variety of baking tools and equipment.  The book does not have a list of the things you will need.  It seems to assume that you already have the proper equipment.  Also note that you must have a large, professional food processor and a stand mixer in order to complete most of the recipes.<br />On the other hand, there are several positive factors.  All of the recipes have been thoroughly tested.  The instructions are unusually complete and correct, making for some recipes that are very long in length.  The description of the various types of chocolate in the introductory chapter is one of the better and more reliable ones.  It is also a great source of the elegant patisserie recipes that make dramatic statements; such recipes are not easy to find among standard chocolate cookbooks.<br />In summary, this is a pretty good collection of chocolate recipes.  It also requires a good inventory of culinary skills that the average person probably does not have, so the chances of success will be variable.  I cannot recommend it for the average person.  If you are already a good baker, however, this book is an excellent source of reliable chocolate recipes.t for the average person.

This is, I take it, suppose to be a guerilla manual for finding a job via the resume.  It's main advantage is the collection of unconventional advise regarding resumes and job hunting.  Unfortunately, very few of his suggestions are really very practical.  It's main value is a morale booster for those whose job hunt has not had much success.

Note that the title \\"Actors and Singers\\" is merely one of the articles contained therein and does not constitute the entirety of the book (it is, however, the longest one, but not the most important one); in fact, it could have any one of a number of titles, including \\"Beethoven\\" or \\"The Destiny of Opera\\".<br />Do I recommend this book?  Well, it is all written by Richard Wagner, so it is by nature at least a little interesting.  Much of the material here is pretty inconsequential.

This book strives to fill that void; it succeeds, up to a point.<br />Wagner reformed traditional opera and created the &quot;music drama&quot;.  The European reaction to this new concept was mixed.  In America, however, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive.  The Metropolitan Opera came into existence on the strength of Wagner's music dramas.  So warm was the reaction, that Wagner even considered (as did his son Siegfried) emigrating.<br />The lion's share of this book is devoted to Anton Seidl, who championed Wagner in New York in the 1890's.  For many years, he worked at Wagner's side in Bayreuth, learning his craft.  In the United States, he championed Wagner's music.  The American public loved it.  The title of this book, Wagner Nights, is a reference to the summer Wagner concerts that Seidl conducted on Coney Island at Brighton Beach.<br />In the latter portion of this book, the author switches from chronicler to analyst.  Here, you must take him with a rather large grain of salt.  He performs a pseudo-Freudian analysis on both the Wagner fans and Wagner's operas.  He also tries his hand with a bit of cultural anthropology.  Here, the information is subjective and marginal. These latter chapters could have been deleted without losing any important information.<br />In spite of these weaknesses, this book is interesting and enlightening.  I recommend it, but with the previously stated reservations.	2001-08-02

It is either immodesty or exaggeration.  I am happy to report that, in this case, the word fits very well.<br />Each recipe is complete unto itself.  It includes the rib type, rib preparation, recommended cooking technique, a rub, the mop, sauces, serving suggestion, etc.  The recipes are simple and easy to follow.  Kudos to the the kitchen testing staff.  Of note is that most recipes can be done simply in an oven, and do not not require a smoker.<br />This is a good example of a cookbook that focuses on only one subject.  It does a very good and very thorough job covering its subject.<br />My complaint here is that the book will not lay open flat in the kitchen when you are doing the recipes.<br />The recipes are reliable, and you will love the flavors.  Highly recommended.	2001-07-11

The listing of individual recipes in the table of contents is a particularly nice feature.<br />The most important part of this book is the 17 championship recipes he teased out of the pros.  This must have been a difficult task, since most  barbecue aficionados are notoriously secretive.  I am most appreciative of this, since these recipes are worth their weight in gold.<br />Although I question some of the recipes, many are worth trying.  The chance is very good that you will find something that you will like and keep with you each summer.	2001-07-11

This term is usually reserved when an acknowledged master of the subject decides to transfer his skills and abilities to others via a special class.  At first, I thought that the use of this term was a little overblown.  How wrong I was.<br />He goes through these subjects: ingredients, rubs, marinades, mops, sauces, and other (salsa, relish, ketchup).  Each subject is expertly covered, and tells you everything you need to know.  He explains the principle and structure of each one, and then gives instructions on how to create it for yourself.  Recipes are then presented for those who do not wish to do the experiments on their own.  My only complaint is the table of contents: more detail would be a great help.<br />This book is the only one you really need when it comes to barcecue sauces.

It is a marginal collection of (by my count) 106 recipes. The main problem is its copyright date: 1995.  Most of the recipes are trendy ones that were hot properties during the cookbook heydays of the early nineties.  The authors explicitly admit this with words such as &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;frou-frou&quot;.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that this book is now obsolete.<br />Here is how the recipe count breaks down: 19 old fashioned, american sauces, 19 fruit based sauces, 17 odd-ball sauces, 18 international sauces, 16 sauces for stuff besides beef and pork, and 17 rubs.<br />Here you can find some of the worst recipes I have ever seen in print (I will spare you the gory details).  At the end there is a short section that lists 50 bottled sauces that the authors have supposedly sampled.  The comments are too brief, long on cute phrases and short on solid opinions.<br />This volume suffers from graphics that are way too &quot;frou-frou&quot;, and anecdotes that are even worse.  I do not fault the lack of pictures, but it does seem as if more money went into the binding and the nice dust jacket than in the visual presentation of the pages.<br />The nicest thing I can think of to say is that it might make a good gift for someone who might be interested in good &quot;Q&quot;.	2001-07-11

This book will sell a ton of copies no matter what I say, but I have some serious reservations about this cookbook.<br />The author has the gift of gab, which is a very good thing in this case.  He has spent considerable time with the best of the barbecue pros, and it shows.  Just reading through this one picks up a wealth of information, and you can't help but learn.<br />One problem is the recipes.  A dirty trick is to present a fantastic recipe that relies on an obscure or hard to get ingredient, and this book is full of them.  Most of these recipes will not become a part of your cooking repetoire.  Another problem is that the majority of the recipes cover a wide range of international recipes.  Traditional, american barbecue gets a scant 50 pages of the nearly 300 pages of this book.  Even here, he favors the upscale and chic.<br />There is a tendency to favor the trendy, like flavor injectors and chutneys.  He also goes through topics such as compound butters and flavored oils.  Also, if you believe his side comments, all of his recipes go with all types of meats, seafoods and vegetables. In one of the more interesting sections, he has some rare recipes for mustards, ketchup, and hot sauces.<br />I also have one beef with the graphics of this book:  many pages have a sidebar that is colored brown.  As a result, it is hard to read the text in them.<br />This book seems to have been aimed at people who will probably never get within a country mile of a smoker.  It covers a lot of ancillary subjects, and the topics covered range all over the place.  This makes for very good reading, but little hard information.  This book is closer to a personal diary than a cookbook.  I can recommend this book because it is so interesting. However, if you are serious about barbecue, you will need a few other books beside this one in your collection.  It certainly is not a &quot;bible&quot;.	2001-07-11

The first (200 pages) consists of pieces that deal with Boulez' attitudes and philosophy about composing and music.  His theories are intellectually interesting, but devoid of musical inspiration.  It seems that his low reputation as composer is well deserved.<br />The second part (also 200 pages) is the most edifying.  He displays a deep understanding of the intricacies of the orchestra, and the interpretation of other composer's works.  It demonstrates why he is such a reliable conductor.<br />The third part (100 pages) is the least interesting.  It is a collection of personal memories and reminisces.<br />As a writer, one admires his courage in tackling subjects (like artistic taste) that so obviously open him up to ridicule.  Few composers have explained their thought processes in a way so clearly understandable to the layman better than Boulez.<br />In summary, one comes to the conclusion that Boulez will be remembered, if he is remembered at all, as a conductor who produced some top notch recordings of Stravinsky and Debussy, and some mediocre Wagner operas.	2001-06-18

From that day until he died, Cosima (soon to be Cosima Wagner) kept a detailed, daily journal of life with &quot;R&quot; (as Cosima calls him).<br />This book is an abridgment of those complete diaries, and a mere 1/4 the length of the original.<br />Martin Cooper, who translated the full length original, did the editing for this abridgment, and he did an admirable job.  He captured the &quot;important&quot; stuff, while leaving out all the detail.  If you just want to read about Wagner, but are not interested in all the fluff, this book is for you.  Learn about Wagner the man without all of the usual hyperbole.<br />Those who are interested in the diaries but are put off by its 2000 pages now have a good alternative.  It can be highly recommended to everyone except specialists.  If you are a Wagner aficionado, however, you will want to get your hands on the full-length original.	2001-06-07

Over the past century and a half, a great deal has been written about him; the book stores are full of such works.  After a while, one gets tired of constantly reading what other people think of Wagner.  In this book, you can read his own words.<br />His collected prose extends to 8 volumes of densely packed type. Wading through them is a daunting task. This book is a carefully chosen selection of those writings where Wagner specifically talks about music, opera, or drama. If you are more interested in Wagner the musician than Wagner the political polemicist, this book is for you.<br />This is a reprint of the 1964 edition by Dutton. It contains the following sections: Cultural Decadence of the Nineteenth Century; The Greek Ideal; The Origins of Modern Opera, Drama, and Music; The Artwork of the Future; Wagner's Development; Bayreuth; Politics. You will find gems such as the original plot for The Ring, and an interesting essay where Wagner describes how he &quot;fixed&quot; some of Beethoven's symphonies.<br />Is Wagner a brilliant, far-reaching visionary who changed the course of art and philosophy for the next century, or a superficial, self-centered despot with a mercurial thought process? Now, you can decide for yourself.	2001-01-02

It seems to be chock full of information, but when you look up a specific category, remarkably few items are actually reviewed.  The author states in the Introduction that many thousands of products were tested, and there was not enough room to list all of them.  Granted, but there seems to have been plenty of space for tangential stories, recipes, and cartoons.  I also object to the emphasis on obscure and rarely used tools; they are quite interesting, but also quite superfluous.  Please note that the items are not ranked or compared in any way, nor are there specific recommendations as to what to buy (except in a couple of rare cases, and even then they do not come right out and say that you should have one of these) or what to avoid, so this book is only marginally useful as a shopping guide for kitchen tools.  In this edition, they have also decided not to include prices.  The stated justification for this is that the prices become out of date within weeks of publication.  True, but very expensive and very inexpensive tools are listed side by side, and some indication as to their costs would be a big help, as many buying decisions will be based on price.  A simple warning in the preface would have sufficed about constantly changing prices.  I also find the reviews of electrical equipment to be suspect; for these, I recommend you stick to a tried and true resource, like a consumer magazine.  It also lacks a beginner's list of essential kitchen tools to have.  This can be a problem, as a kitchen novice might draw the conclusion, after reading this book, that many hundreds of tools are necessary kitchen basics.<br />Still, I greatly enjoyed going through this elegant coffee table book.  I even learned a couple of things, like the $40 cooking spoon, the griddle made of green soapstone, and the vacuum pot coffee maker.  I found out about the $40 price not from the book, but when I tried to buy one at a nearby kitchenware store.  The most valuable part of this book is the list of recommended cookbooks at the back.  At $30 or $40 a throw, there are far too many mediocre cookbooks in print today.<br />If you approach this book as an all-inclusive, everything-including-the-kitchen-sink encyclopedia of kitchen tools, it works.  However, if you are interested in a list of basic items to equip a home kitchen or some type of buying guide, you will have to look elsewhere.ot coffee maker.

Like flappers and disco, this too shall pass.  The current generation of opera producers have grown up with television and commercials.  They have the attention span of a gnat.  One suspects that they have never taken the time to read Shakespeare's plays or the Bible.  Their style of opera consists of a random jumble of visual elements and designs taken from disparate sources, cultures, and time periods.  Mr. Sutcliffe has been a British opera critic for a very long time and has seen the ebb and flow of many trends in the opera house.  His book would be more valuble if he had concentrated on documenting rather than trying to justify the off-the-wall staging of opera.	2000-12-04
