First, an admission, I could only make it about half-way through this book. What I did read was neither particularly original nor particularly well written. The real turn-off for me was the tone of the book which was like a second year college student who's learned a new fact and then damns the foolish masses for not being as intelligence as he. There's been other books published that deal with this subject and which do a better job of presenting the facts without the 'Mr. Know-It-All' attitude.	2004-02-13

While many of the houses are interesting, the style of most of them is 'European modern' or even experimental (that's not meant as a criticism in itself).  In the author's introduction the sub-heading is \\"...producing small architectural objects...\\" -- that's a good description, the houses are more architectural objects than anything else.  So, if you're interested in modern trends in residential architecture, this is a great book; if you interested in modest, economical homes of a more traditional nature, this definitely isn't the book for you.	2003-11-14

Typical of the books publisher by Taunton, this is a well produced work -- nicely arranged, good photos, and with about the right amount of verbiage for each house.  My less than five star rating is because I personally didn't find most of the houses to be that interesting design-wise (you may, 'look inside'), and I also thought too many of the house were either too big (several in the 2300-2400 sq. ft. size, which I don't consider 'small') or too expensive due to site conditions, materials or whatever.  It not too hard to build a nice small home if you've actually got the budget for a much larger, more traditional house.  I enjoyed the book, it's just not one of my favorites.  A side note, all of the houses have been featured in Fine Homebuilding Magazine previously.	2003-10-31

I'm not being completely snide when I say this book would probably be most interesting to those who get their financial advice from Suze Orman, their view of history from Joseph Campbell and their religious training from Deepak Chopra.  For once, I'd like one of these people with the &quot;answer to everything&quot; to be more than a motivational speaker or writer (why not trying curing cancer?).  I can't imagine why he hasn't shown up on a PBS special (or did I miss him?).  On the plus side, he at least makes his book somewhat enjoyable and it's probably not a completely waste of time to read the book and find some inspiration.	2003-08-22

While either is acceptable as a good overall guide to baseball, I'd lean toward Johnny Bench's book; there seems to be more 'meat on it', even though I agree with one reviewer that there's a few too many personal anecdotes. One positive about either of the books mentioned is that while many of the 'Idiot's/Dummies' books had way too much 'forced humor', it's kept to a reasonable level on these.<br />Once you've digested either book, you might consider \\"Men at Work\\" by George Wills, \\"A Thinking Man's Guide to Baseball\\" by Leonard Koppett, \\"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans\\" and the controversial but enjoyable book, \\"Ball Four\\" by Jim Bouton.	2003-05-13

Whether 1998 was baseball's greatest year or not is open for debate, of course.  If it was, then this book doesn't do a very good job of retelling those events. It misses much of the excitement of that year.  A big part of the problem is the format of the book: a particular date is called out, then a particular player is singled out for discussion for that date (maybe he got a hit that day), then a retelling of his career ups and downs, punctuated with statistics even baseball fans will find uninteresting (\\"..the only player since Joe Blow in 1973 to get two hits, steal two bases, and catch a fly ball in both left and right field....\\" - that's not a direct quote, just the way it seemed to me).  In other words, the book is on the dull side.<br />The second problem is that the book wanders all over the place.  Rather than being largely about the 1998 season, it becomes a soapbox for Mr. McCarver's opinion on the whole field and history of baseball.<br />One the plus side, it's nice to hear the experiences of someone who's closer to the action than most of us get to be.  And it's nice to tell some stories and antidotes I hadn't heard before.	2003-04-03

There were a few quirky points I could nitpick about -- the characters are a little mannered and Mr. Mifflin, the eccentric but charming bookseller, is at his best discussing books and less interesting as an anti-war crusader, but these I wrote off to the time period the book was written.  For me, they didn't distract much from the overall enjoyment of the book.  Even the mystery to the plot turned out better than I'd expected.

I occasionally enjoy a good western, but how \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" ever got to be considered a western classic is beyond me.  Between the sickeningly chivalrous Lassiter, the nave but always-dutiful Jane (and the rest of the set-piece characters), I could easily imagine it was written by Louisa May Alcott or one of the Bronte sisters in their father's attic.  This may be worth a try if you've never read Zane Grey before and want to give it a try but I think I'll stick with Jack Schaffer (try &quot;Monte Walsh&quot;), Louis L'Amour, Larry McMurtry or A.B.

This could have been a fine little novel, instead the author's heavy-handed plot and overblown prose mangled it into a mediocre piece of work at best (the author would probably describe the style as 'lyrical, deeply haunting prose that reaches into the very soul and foundation of fragile being-ness' -- and that would be just if one of the characters lost her shoes...).  It's somewhat better than a romance novel tear-jerker, but not all that much.<br />In the book the main character drank too much; if I had been married to her...I would have started drinking!	2002-09-26

If you're a fan of minimalist spaces or Euro-Industrial-Tech type houses you're probably love this book (or if you're an architectural student, you'll probably love this book).  If you're primarily interest in small homes of a more traditional design however, this is definitely not the book for you.  I don't think the description listed with the book does a good job of stating that (nor the photo on the cover). My only real comments about the book itself is that it seems oddly dated, even though the book was published in 2001 ('high-design' houses have a short life-span of being avant-garde I'm guessing), and that it is a well-designed and interesting book for the right audience.	2002-08-06

Many of the homes featured are interesting and beautifully photographed, even if a bit exotic and large to be simply labeled 'vacation homes and hideaways.' However, as you might expect from House & Garden, it's still primarily an 'interiors book.' There are no floor plans and few exterior photographs.

One minor comment: while the text certainly isn't 'phone book' tiny, I wish they'd used a larger text and made two volumes out of it if necessary.

But during the final few chapters, when you'd expect things to start 'coming together' and the characters to be fully developed, the plot seems to lose cohesion and comes to a somewhat loose ending (but by then I had lost much of my interest in whatever became of the main characters).

As an introduction to 'following the crowd' and other investor temptations though, it does okay. It's good to take stock of yourself occasionally and this book should help. And, thankfully, the pages devoted to the tulip mania of the 1600s was mercifully few (does every investment book these day have to retell that story; often incorrectly).	2002-02-05

Included for each is a description of why the cabin was build and how it's used, floor plan(s), site plan (sometimes of limited value), interior and exterior photographs; as well as a general introduction to why cabins are considered by many to be the &quot;classic American getaway.&quot; While I might argue about the inclusion of a few of the homes, overall it's one of the better books I've seen on cabins and why they occupy a special place in the minds of some of us. The quality of the photographs and the book in general is also very good (especially considering the price of the book). It is a book for the imagination or for those considering ideas and makes no attempt to be a construction 'how to' book however. I'd also recommend the books by Tedd Benson on timber framing (if you are at all considering a timber frame), the Jim Tolpin book on cottages, and the Donald Berg books on building in the country.	2001-10-03

I don't want to be too hard on this book since I at least enjoyed parts of it (and I thought the basic storyline had promise), but I'm also glad it wasn't any longer or I probably wouldn't have finished reading it. The plot really isn't that convincing, the main characters are almost silly -- the dialogue at times sounds like it was written for day-time television -- and, frankly, it just strives to high heaven to be 'poignant' in capital letters.

This book isn't great literature and doesn't claim to be, but it's fine for a lazy afternoon when you just want something to read.  It's the kind of book you can enjoy but forget you read a year from now.  It also has what you might expect: a plot based on a string of incredible coincidences and 'not-very-deep' characters (I found myself actually hoping that the bad guys would snuff-out the heroine at one point just to shut her up).
