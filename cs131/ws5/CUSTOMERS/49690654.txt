There is a strong need to cover a modern approach to JavaScript programming, many old hacks aren't required anymore and this book showcase a good amount of up to date techniques. The whole book is 100% practical oriented and assume previous experience with client-side webdeveloping. Organization among the chapters is somewhat lacking but the examples are usually quite easy to follow. I especially appreciated how the author try to follow standards as much as possible, but he keeps a pragmatic attitude when the need arise.	2005-06-17

It's nice to see how finally there is another JavaScript book worth reading apart from the classic titles by Goodman and Flanagan. The book is not aimed at beginners; you either have some solid JavaScript knowledge or a decent programming experience with other languages. Compared to other titles this stands out for the chapters covering modern techniques: DOM, Client-Server Communication, XML/XSLT, and Web Services. I would say it's the most current coverage of JavaScript to date. In my own opinion, only some poor editing and organisation prevent it from reaching five stars.	2005-06-06

The amount of pages isn't huge but, in my opinion, provides an effective coverage of RSS. Most code listings use Perl, making them useless for people (like me) using other languages but this doesn't really affect the book too much, since the goal isn't to provide a collection of coding recipes.

This book instead was exactly what I needed, it assume you know PHP 4 and covers only the new features with a good amount of details and a bunch of useful suggestions for code migration. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that in the chapters covering OOP and DOM the author try to explain the new functionalities but also attempt to throw in the mix more generic info on this two topics. The end results are somewhat mixed, the coverage of PHP 5 is, in my opinion, very good, but the material about OOP and DOM instead aren't up to the rest and does more harm than good.	2004-09-04

I really enjoyed it, especially because similar material available on-line is usually scattered across a multitude of different sources. Most content is interesting even for application developers and I especially liked the chapters covering different security related modules.  <br />The chapter on automation, being totally based around Bash scripts was almost useless to me (but then, again, I am biased).

Unlike within other competing titles, you will not find any redundancy here.

Take a look at the TOC and you will find plenty of useful material, from portable database connectivity, to SOAP, XML and much more.

First, provide a full, in depth coverage of the java.util.regex engine, then, offer a basic but complete introduction to RegExp. While he achieves the first goal in a very brilliant way, I still wouldn't suggest the book to somebody totally new to RegExp.

FrameMaker is a powerful and sophisticated tool, with XML capabilities that were build on top of its SGML legacy, so it's a pretty complex beast to learn. This book was just right on the spot; it allowed me to save an outrageous amount of time and frustration.

Friedl's book from O'Reilly is excellent, but not suited for beginners. Ben Forta distilled the essential of the subject inside a compact, easy to follow book. Even seasoned programmers often consider the topic arcane, but the author brilliantly managed to cover it in a way that can be easily understood by everybody and still being relevant (avoiding the pitfalls so typical of \\"dummies\\" manuals). Every chapter revolves around a set of practical examples, evolving in a linear way, from the very basic up to a few more sophisticated techniques covered inside the last two chapters.<BR>Forta covers Regular Expressions in a language and implementation agnostic way; the result is worth reading regardless of the language/platform you use. It's a small, handy manual that makes the power of Regular Expressions accessible to everybody. Heartily recommended!	2004-03-07

The authors took pretty complex concepts but managed to make them much easier to understand, aided by concise and relevant examples.

That's why a book like this, which provides a solid introduction to XSLT, may be more valuable than you would expect. The author manages to assemble an entry-level book without writing another useless \\"for dummies\\" guide. Fitzgerald filled the book with a huge amount of practical examples; you get plenty of code listings that often build on top of each other; incrementing the complexity along the way (an effective choice). In my opinion the writing style isn't always crystal clear and the author often introduce topics too early, briefly mentioning things that get a full explanation only a few chapters later. Notwithstanding this shortcoming, I think it's an excellent book that can really help getting started with XSLT. I would suggest to read it in a linear fashion, from beginning to the end in order to get the best out of it.	2003-12-20

Compared to Fowler's seminal title this one, due to its \\"workbook\\" nature, is much more Java-centric, making it harder to translate certain concepts to different languages and environments.

The author start from scratch and goes up to explain more advanced features like tagging and branching.

This book is about best practices, patterns and anti-patterns, and about how to use XML correctly and efficiently. As with other titles from the same author, this book is a pleasure to read, clean, informative and well structured. In my opinion a must have for the serious XML practitioner. Be advised this is not a book for beginners, the author takes for granted you already mastered the fundamentals of XML and many related technologies like DTD, Schema or Namespace. In order to really get the best out of it you better have some experience using XML under your belt.	2003-11-29

So, if you already have some decent experience with ColdFusion or web developing in general (no matter the language), give yourself a favor and get a copy of Brooks-Bilson's book. The author delivers a well-structured, systematic reference to ColdFusion; just what a developer needs to get the job done, also a handy reference to keep near the keyboard.

This book digs deep into CFC, covering both their great features and their shortcomings and it even uncovers a few bugs along the way. The author's main targets are developers used to CFML and procedural programming that need to get acquainted with the new, OOP-like, paradigm introduced by CFC. Still, seasoned OOP programmers may benefit from it as well, since CFC implementation diverges in many ways from many traditional OOP concepts. Compared to other books of similar size it can be a little overprized, but you should consider Techspedition is a very small, independent, publisher that really deserve our support	2003-01-23

You will find some good real world advice and tips on CSS, intermediate level, pratical JavaScript (really sophisticated JavaScript is pretty rare everywhere) but only some marginal coverage of the DOM	2003-01-22

I think that PHP 4 is still lacking in the area of XML integration, but intermediate and advanced developers can still perform a lot of tasks using this combo. The book is clearly written; it covers a lot of different extensions and third party libraries with full code listings	2003-01-22

After reading so many (too many actually) 1000+ pages reference beasts, a book like Dreamweaver MX Killer Tips is not only refreshing, it also bring back the pleasure of reading. Joseph and Angela managed to assemble a terrific amount of first quality tips but also a very pleasant and entertaining read. Do you want to hear something negative? Sure, there are only 232 pages; I wish the book was double the size!<br />A final note, it may appear a little expensive, but the whole Killer Tips series is printed on quality paper and full colours, New Riders delivers a very effective layout and typography job	2003-01-22

In my opinion the author spend too much time (actually half of the book) revisiting basic concepts that any PHP developer should know pretty well, still he manages to provide very interesting information on topics that you hardly find covered elsewhere, like integrating PHP with COM, .NET, ADO or Active Directory	2003-01-19

Following the typical glasshaus approach the authors go straight to the relevant information, assuming the reader already know how to use Dreamweaver. A good amount of space is dedicated to MySQL and database-related topics, a wise choice in my opinion. All in all, a must have for Dreamweaver/PHP developers	2003-01-19

The authors don't waste time, straight to the meat; the book is actually full of well-explained code listings. The sample applications use ASP/SQL server and PHP/MySQL, but a lot of material is still relevant for other technologies, especially the coverage of database design, but also usability, interfaces and workflow<BR>BTW The book is actually 300+ pages long	2003-01-19

The book contains 10 chapters, covering different topics; each chapter stands on its own, allowing the reader to pick only one topic at time, there is no need to read from cover to cover here. The vast majority of the material available here is simply not available elsewhere; Mr Lowery covered things that may surprise even a seasoned Dreamweaver veteran like me.

The authors definitely did a remarkable job; covering a broad range of topics, from error handling (too often neglected by web developers!), to creating extensions, object oriented programming (a brief but effective coverage), file handling, mail integration, Regular Expressions and much more, including quite advanced topics like generating images and Flash integration.<br />The chapters are pretty much self contained, so a linear reading isn't mandatory here, assuming you know the basis of PHP you can just jump directly to a chapter depending on your needs or tastes. Notwithstanding the fact that glasshaus assembled a team of six different authors, the quality of the chapters is consistently excellent. I was only somewhat disappointed by the XML chapter but that's just because I think PHP and XML integration is not up to the level I expect from a modern language, definitely not the author's fault!<br />Be advised that this book is much more about PHP than Dreamweaver because, out of the box, Dreamweaver offers only basic tools for PHP development and if you want to take the next step you need to dive into the code. Beginners may be better served by &quot;Dreamweaver MX: PHP Web Development&quot; from the same publisher.	2003-01-16

Not a book for the faint of heart, get it only if you want to investigate this very specific topic or plan to do things like XML &gt; PDF transformation. The author digs immediately into the technical details, condensing a relevant amount of info in less than 200 pages; the results are good, focused and well structured, but it's not an entertaining read. This is definitely not a beginner book. A decent understanding of XML, XSL and XPath is required; some knowledge of printing would be helpful too	2003-01-15

I especially appreciated that the author, unlike many other XSLT adopters, doesn't pretend to use XSLT to solve each and every problem, instead it provide good advices and a good amount of common sense on why and where XSLT can be a good choice.

This is a small and very focused book that manages to offer a detailed coverage of XPath mixed with some excellent practical advices.

Joe covers much more than just DOM programming for browsers and the books contains a few gems like coverage of Xerces, Dreamweaver's API, generic DOM algorithms and a dedicated chapter on the future of DOM.
