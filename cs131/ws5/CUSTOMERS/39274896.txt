I'm a hopeless romantic.  Although, I'll admit there are some things that make me role my eyes, such as: 1. The sci-fi element only because she has mass-space travel &amp; colonization, human droids, flying vehicles, etc. and the books are only set about 50 years from now. I don't see that as a realistic possibility. 2. There's a not-so-subtle liberal slant to her stories, such as a national gun ban, legalized prostitution, etc.(And Conservative politician or their supporters are the villains in more than one book in this series, including Conspiracy in Death.) <br />The relationship between the hero and heroine though are the selling point for me. And in Conspiracy, Eve is forced to face her worst fear ... being without her badge, which for her equals her identity. It's a powerful struggle and makes this book worth reading. The rest, I can overlook. It is fiction after all! :)	2004-03-26

When more bodies show up back on planet Earth, Eve faces another case where clues lead to her new husband. (But then, the guy owns practically everything!) <br />I found this one fascinating because of the concepts of subliminal messaging in virtual reality toys... manufactured by Roarke's company... and especially the growing love between the two main characters. How they relate to one another is amazing.	2004-03-25

When two men and one woman are brutally murdered, all of the clues lead Eve to Roarke's stuffy butler, Summerset, as the killer. But the victims and the prime suspect all share a common past... and secret... with Roarke. He may be a seductive multi-billionaire now, but the former criminal/vigilante is also married to a cop. Now, he's forced to return to the land of his brutal childhood and deal with a deadly secret that could threaten his relationship with the woman he loves. Eve is forced to weigh her feelings for the man she loves and her own sense of justice when his illegal past is revealed.	2004-03-25

If you enjoy Ms. Feehan's Dark series about the vampiric Carpathians, you'll enjoy this book. No blood-sucking, but it does have a paranormal twist, including a long-distance love scene that's absolutely &quot;dreamy&quot;. Like her Carpathian's, the characters in Shadow Game can communicate telepathically. The love scenes are very sensual and the plot is intriguing. <br />Again, the main complaint that I have... and the reason why I'm not rating this book a 5 star... is her overly frequent use of the catch phrase: &quot;take his/her breath away&quot;. You don't even get 4 pages into this one before it appears and at one point it occurs once each on facing pages. It appears SO OFTEN in this book (and actually, in ALL her books) that it's amazing her characters don't die of asphyxiation! Once, twice, three times TOPS is more than enough... I wish either she or her editor would search for the darn words and delete them! They aren't necessary.	2003-11-14

Ms. Foster returns with another Winston novel, this time about the cousin of the four sexy brothers from the books, \\"The Winston Brothers\\" and \\"Wild\\", the latter book being where the hero and heroine of this book make their debut. Although one character from \\"The WB\\" book appears early on in the book, and references are made to the other cousins & their wives, Ms. Foster does NOT bog you down with these other characters. Instead, the book takes place in a whole new settings, with new supporting characters, which is refreshing.<br />The hero, Joe Winston, is a 30-something, tall, gorgeous, women-magnet (He is a Winston afterall!) and a former police officer-turned-bounty-hunter/bodyguard. The heroine is Luna, a woman who previously said \\"No\\" in a rather forceful way to Joe's advances, returns to ask for his help and expertise as a bodyguard. Luna is now the guardian of two orphaned cousins and is moving out-of-state to care for the kids, who are apparently in serious trouble in a small town. <br />The bad guys and/or gals are pretty easy to identify, so don't read this book if you are looking for a challenging who-done-it? The suspense is really a mild form of \\"when will they show up and what will happen then?\\" It's more of an easy read about two single people who think they know each other... with neither being too sure about their own capabilities as adult mentors/guardians to some kids... but both finding out they enjoy learning otherwise.	2003-08-13

It's set in post-Civil War Texas and pits a head-strong school teacher up against the tough, mysterious -and reluctant - leader of a six pack of very deadly Confederate veterans. All the men have troubled pasts, but they bring strength in honest loyalty to the struggling western town. Reese, haunted by a past failure, brings realism to the forefront as his relationship develops with the independently loving teacher, Mary. It's a story that has the tension of danger, splashes of humor, and a lovingly happy ending.<br />I recommend reading them all and in order: Reese, Sullivan, Rico, Jed, Nate, and Cash. If you like western romances, you can't fail by trying this series; but be warned, you'll come to love the town and folks of Rock Creek so much, you'll hate to see the series end! I did!	2003-08-05

I enjoyed the big brother, little sister relationship between Eden and Jed... as well as the conflict Sinclair &quot;Sin&quot; Sullivan faces when he falls for his friends baby sister!<br />It all makes for a great western romance and a super second installment to the Rock Creek Six series.

He is a strong character, quite capable of handling the conflicts that arise throughout the book, but it's his witty repartee and wonderful sense of humor with which he views life and his &quot;fiancee&quot; that captured my attention, kept me grinning with each passing page, and made me fall in love. <br />And I must give Ms. Balogh an A+ for managing to turn around my opinion of the oh-so-serious tomboy sister-of-a-Duke, known as &quot;Free&quot; to her family. Joshua's ability to &quot;take her down a peg or two&quot; is so well written, you just have to laugh! She becomes the perfect balance to the fun-loving Marquess and their initial encounters, which ultimately lead to a full-blown relationship that's very real indeed, were an absolute joy to read!<br />I highly recommend this series: Just in case, for those who don't already know... the order is Slightly Married, Slightly Wicked and Slightly Scandalous... so far.

Set in sultry New Orleans, this imaginative novel brings a facinating twist to the vampiric legend. <br />Ms. Kenyon does a great job of weaving the main characters of this book with those from Fantasy Lover, which is an added treat for readers of that book. She does a good job of making this book capable of standing on it's own, and not relying too heavily on an understanding of the events in its predecesor. <br />Both main characters, Kyrian and Amanda, are worthy of their roles, and I thoroughly enjoyed Amanda's wit. &quot;Yummy Leather Guy&quot; INDEED! :) <br />It's a job well-done by Ms. Kenyon and sure to keep the world of the Dark Hunters alive and well on book store shelves!

Cash is the final installment in the Rock Creek Six series, about a band of six former Confederate soldiers who have only their bond of loyalty to each other... until one-by-one... they overcome their troubled pasts to find a future in love.<br />Daniel Cash is the deadliest one of the bunch. He excells at womanizing and gambling, and has a well-known and well-deserved name as a gunfighter. Hurt deeply by the woman he once loved, his bitterness toward &quot;nice&quot; girls spills over into everything he does and is reflected in the cold lifelessness of his eyes. But, throughout the series, the reader gets glimpses of something deeper: his loyalty to friends, his sense of humor, and his pained heart. In the book, Cash, he finally finds peace by facing his past - in the flesh... whether he likes it or not - and learning that he doesn't have to face the future alone. The climactic confrontation gives a wonderful indepth look at the life of a professional gunfighter and the resulting sacrifices. <br />It's an enjoyable end to a super western romance series.

But, all in all, the story is entertaining and has strong characters. Ranulf, a rather arrogant character to be sure, does show a tender side in his relationship with his Grandmother, and a strength in not simply wedding her \\"first pick\\" but following his heart. Judith shows her strength much later than I expected, but she redeems herself by \\"holding out\\" for a match that's worthy of the vows to be spoken. <br />A good second book in a series that's proving to be MORE than SLIGHTLY Worth it!	2003-08-05

But, Ms. Balogh's journey from promise to love is filled with intriguing complications and interesting characters! The hero is a man of honor, worthy of the lead role... and the heroine proves her strength when she takes on the Bedwyns and captures the heart of her hero.

Ms. Kenyon has created a fabulous world of Dark Hunters and Talon is definitely worthy of the name. <br />Like many books in series such as this, there are a lot of characters, many making repeat appearances from previous books. That can be a bonus for those who've read the whole series and are familiar with the cast of characters. But, it also poses a difficult task for the author who has to balance the stand-alone storyline of the hero and heroine while including enough tidbits about the rest of the cast to prevent confusion and provide the best overall picture of the world the author has invisioned. To do this without seeming to be over-explaining everything is ...like I said before... a difficult task.<br />Still, Ms. Kenyon does provide a great hero in the ancient Celt and a great conflict which primarily involves as secondary character (albeit one worthy of noticing!) named Acheron. All in all Night Embrace does a good job of continuing the overall matrix of her Dark Hunter world and it is sure to keep readers following the series looking for more!	2003-08-05

A work-a-holic, no-success-with-relationships, woman bows to her somewhat loony psychic friend's pressure when presented with a very erotically sexy picture in an ancient book. Is the old text for real? No. No way could HE be real flesh and blood, even if she did call out his name three times at midnight on a full moon while holding to the book to her heart! But that's exactly what happens. And, for the next four weeks, the odd couple is nearly inseparable... as he can't help but tempt her beyond endurance while she tries to hold him (and his hormones) at bay in an effort to rescue him from a curse and capture true love forever! <br />John De Salvo on the cover is superb, even if the picture is small. (A larger copy is on Ms. Kenyon's Web site!) But, the fantasy that Ms. Kenyon weaves is the dessert.	2003-08-01

I absolutely LOVE this series; otherwise, I NEVER would have even considered buying a hardcover. I prefer smaller paperback books, but Ms. Brockmann can be credited for providing such an interesting world within a fictional US SEAL Team that I couldn't possibly wait for the paperback!  I had to know how the outcome of the cliff-hanger from the last book. I had to know how Sam was going to win Alyssa back, after following their nail-biting, teeth-grinding exploits throughout the other books in this series. I had to know how the investigation would end and whether Sam's estranged wife and beloved daughter were really dead in that house!<br />I'm happy to say Ms. Brockmann delivers on all those unanswered questions... once again providing a thrilling mystery interwoven with great characters and plenty of love. Old friends are revisited and new twists keep the pace going full throttle. And again, the flashbacks to a WWII romance are an added bonus. Thank goodness, Ms. Brockmann hasn't \\"Gone Too Far\\", but has plenty more stories of wonderful characters to tell. I now look forward to Max and Gina's story! But in the meantime, I'll reread the series start to finish... it's just that good! Worthy of keeping.

One would expect a story from a NY Times Best Selling Author to have deep characters and a superb, entertaining plot. An ideal novel would have a great mix where a talented writer combines the mystery of criminal investigation with the romance of a heart-touching love story. I thought I'd found that in Trading Places. I was SO wrong!  I figure this book got published only because of the author's name. Shame on the author, the editor (if there even was one), and shame on the publisher! It couldn't possibly have been published for worthy content or talented editing.   Oh, it starts off with promise: A female police detective is nearly killed along with her K-9; Her male partner is killed, and she wants those responsible. Good start. Good premise. Makes a reader want to buy the book. If you stopped there, you might be happy, but pay for it, and it goes downhill almost as soon as you open the book.  So, let me save you money and wasted time: Here's the book's plot highlights...(No joke. This really is the plot, if one could call it that.) 1. During female cop's 6 months of recovery, her twin sister doesn't find out about the ambush, and hasn't been bothered about the lack of communication with her sister. 2. Healthy twin doesn't show up at the hospital or even in the town to find out why the lack of communication from hurt sister. 3. The twins have a very close and loving relationship, DESPITE 1 and 2. 4. Healthy twin can forego her &#34;illegal&#34; life as a Vegas gambler/millionaire and fill in for the hurt, yet law-abiding twin by--somehow--posing successfully as an experienced detective among real cops, real detectives who are clueless apparently, and never figure out the sisters have switched places!  5. Healthy twin is willing--and able?--to risk her own life to uncover the truth about a corrupt police dept that she knows nothing about with help from a male reporter she just met, and the unlikely pair can accomplish it all without being discovered. 6. She can call in a few chorus line dancers to help &#34;house-sit&#34; her sister's home without blowing her cover, because the hurt twin is not staying home to help out in the investigation at all! 7. No, meanwhile, the hurt twin, who is a closet millionaire in her own right - lucky her! - doesn't stay in town to help the healthy twin risk her life in the undercover escapade. No filling in sister on who is who on the police force. No teaching sister about police codes, procedures, etc. Why include any of that? No, hurt twin decides to go off with a male professor friend to an isolated farm the twins inherited, but kept secret (for no apparent reason), to grow &#34;organic carrots&#34;. No kidding! Cop leaves to become farmer, while gambling sister comes to the rescue by impersonating a police officer to uncover corruption within the department.  Of course, this being a romance, both girls fall in love with their men, and vice versa, although you're given very little reason why. But hey, they make love, so there's something building between them, right?! Uh... well, you're left to wonder, because Ms Michaels brings the reader to the brink — such as reporter and &#34;fake cop&#34; sis about to get it on after breaking into a suspect's house, even though they believe suspect could show up any second! — then...NOTHING...change of scene/new chapter...with MORE dialogue. WOW! You're the best, most &#34;agile&#34; lover I've every had! ...   Oh, really? When? How? What? Who? Why?  The idea of hurt good cop struggling to uncover bad cops, and succeeding, is a good concept, but that's all this book has going for it. The rest is unbelievably boring! And the entire novel needed an editor who could read & especially keep track of which &#34;hero&#34; was supposed to be with which &#34;heroine&#34;.  I couldn't get through this one. I found myself skipping numerous pages right and left and rolling my eyes at the never-ending dialogue, wondering what's the point?! I finally jumped to the last couple pages to ensure at least a happy ending (I am a hopeless romantic), then dropped the book and picked up another... with relief.  Wish I'd read some of these other reviews BEFORE wasting my money on this one.	2003-07-22

She continues her action-filled adventures of the US Navy SEAL Team known as the \\"Troubleshooters,\\" and proves once again her amazing ability to weave threads of several stories, each with its own surprises and suspenseful action. I love the flash-backs to WWII and tales of love from that era. It's just an added treat that makes each book more than just a single romance novel.<BR>If you've never read any of her books, I wouldn't recommend this book as the first Brockmann book to read, NOT because it isn't worthy -- It IS a great book! -- No, I say this only because it's the middle of a series; it drops you in the middle of the action... in the middle of some relationships that have steadily developed over the course of her \\"Troubleshooters\\" books. Although Brockmann is talented enough to provide the required background so things are not confusing, this book's better when viewed as part of the whole on-going SEAL Team adventures. The book contains multiple plots, which can appear to slow things down as far as the main love story is concerned. There's the main plot of Mike and Joan, Sam's tumultuous love-triangle with his wife from a forced-marriage and the FBI agent/former lover who is his true love, and of course Brockmann's trademark WWII love story provided this time by Joan's grandparent's. Admittedly, the book is packed and at least one plot line will leave you hanging... So, I recommend for the best treat, start at the beginning with Unsung Hero. (#2 is Defiant Hero, #3 is Over the Edge, #4 is Out of Control, and then #5 Into the Night). This way, you can really get to the know her characters and follow their progress. The main characters you meet in books 1-4 all make appearances in 5, so it helps knowing their history. And with each book, you'll come to love this team of men and enjoy watching their adventures. They'll certainly make you laugh, bring you to tears, and make you grit your teeth! <BR>As far as the main plot, it is about Lt JG Mike Muldoon: the Goody-two-shoes of the SEALS team ... and I only say that, because well \\"Gosh\\" he's such a NICE guy! He made a rather kissable appearance in book 4, that made me want to see him find his own true love... and for once, have to work for it! :) But he's also 100% Navy SEAL, which means he's a full-grown man, strong enough to be this novel's hero and one that won't \\"ring the bell\\" and quit until he captures true love with the woman he wants... even if it means scaling over her own heart's protective walls. ... Now, as for that cliff-hanger... #6 \\"Gone Too Far\\" is available now in hardcover and picks up at the cliff's edge! Ms Brockmann, you (and your SEALS) have me hooked; keep up the good work!	2003-02-12

This re-issue of \\"Forever Blue\\" proves that Brockmann's tales of military-men-in-love are timeless stories, that can still entertain. Blue McCoy is a SEAL returning to small-town America, to bravely face an uncomfortable situation: his step-brother is about to marry his high-school sweatheart. Trained to tackle trouble with a team, he's forced to face a personal crisis without his SEAL teammates when he becomes the prime suspect in his step-brother's murder. Blue finds a new partner in a now-grown-former-tomboy named Lucy, a faithful childhood acquaintance... and Lucy finds out that the \\"hero\\" she had a crush on long ago is really just a \\"man\\" worthy of her heart's love. All-in-all, Forever Blue is a simple love story with a bit of adventure and mystery thrown in.<br />For those unfamiliar with Brockmann's SEAL books, she has written two separate series. \\"Forever Blue\\" is book #2 of her first SEAL Team series, which is not as complicated as her new SEAL Team \\"Troubleshooters\\" series. The first series (beginning with #1 \\"Prince Joe\\" reprinted last year and continuing with the re-release of #3 \\"Frisco Kid\\") is made up of 11 shorter novels, each focusing on one member of the team and his path to true love. I'm personally thrilled to see these books making a reappearance on book-store shelves! The newer series (beginning with #1 \\"Unsung Hero\\") contains 5 books to date --all still in print-- that are longer more in-depth novels. Unique to this new series is that each book contains a main plot involving the hero (a member of the SEAL Team) and his lady love, but each book also has another love story expertly interwoven within the pages that flashes you back to WWII. An additional bonus is the on-going personal adventures of two supporting characters...the SEAL from Texas, Roger \\"Sam\\" Starrett, whose tumultuous love interest in FBI sharpshooter Alyssa Locke makes for a roller-coasterstory line providing plenty of cliff-hangers that doesn't climax until book #6, Gone Too Far, which just came out in hardcover in 2003!<br />For light reading, I recommend the first series, although admittedly, getting through the whole series is made tougher with some of the 11 books being out of print.<BR>For in-depth, more for your money, adventurous love stories, try the new series. Either way, I highly recommend reading both in sequence.	2003-02-12

I read this book long before Oklahoma City... long before 9-11... and before the movie-version came out, which is why I got excited about it actually coming to the box office. I wanted to see what parts of Clancy's intricately laid plot would make it past the cutting room floor. <br />Indeed, the movie was very good, and one I recommend highly, but in typical Hollywood-style, it varies from the book - widely so. The bad guys are not even the same; the terrorists in the book were not modern day German-Nazis using poor Middle-eastern farmers and hiring, then killing Russian scientists. (Instead, the scientists are German and Clancy's original bad guys are closer to 9-11 reality, which makes me wonder why the change back to a WWII \\"Axis Powers\\" concept in the movie?) In the book, the bomb is not hidden in a vending machine and it does not blow up on the East Coast at Boston, but deep in \\"our nation's heartland\\"...giving new meaning to Mile High Stadium. (Except for the type of bomb, Timothy McVeigh got closer to Clancy's plot than the movie does.) <br />So... yes, if you like intricate details to a life-or-death suspenseful puzzle, I recommend the book over the movie. But, the movie is-for obvious reasons-much faster paced. I admit the book is long and very, very (did I stress, very) detailed. So, it's not a \\"fast\\" read. You can't skim scenes without the risk of missing some vital clue. It bounces around from lumberjacks cutting down a tree to a sub deep in the ocean to Arabic farmers digging in the desert sands, and it's hundreds of pages before you find out how everything ties together... but the SUM of it all is a very thrilling climax to a story that I pray never becomes reality, although it's already come closer than I like to admit. Unfortunately, Jack Ryan wasn't part of that reality. :)	2002-11-01

But it breaks from the Clancy norm in that it's not as intricately detailed, technically-speaking, which makes it a great book to recommend to 1st-time Clancy readers.<br />For those who have read other Clancy novels, and therefore may be familiar with the main character, John Clark... or if you've seen the movie &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; or the more recent &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot; and recall Clark (played by Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber, respectively)... Without Remorse gives you the story behind the deadly CIA operative.<br />Not that I don't thoroughly enjoy the Jack Ryan series, but the Clark character is mysteriously intriguing and telling his history is Clancy at his best. It's my favorite Clancy novel.	2002-11-01

Kiss and Tell is 1st in a trilogy on the Wright family. This one is about the daughter who is at a cross-roads in her life and seeks only to get away for a while from her over-protective but loving brothers (Heros in books 2 &amp; 3)... She meets a rough, crude, mountain-man in the woods who's more like her brothers than she can imagine. Jake's a top secret military agent with deadly problems of his own. He doesn't need a city-slicker/computer analyst with a big (yet unbelievably bright) dog to get in the way. A great start to the series. Worth reading but, I give this one 4 stars... leaving a little room for improvement, since having read all three, I know the series gets better when the focus turns to her brothers! :)	2002-10-25

I truly liked reading about these 4 brothers and noting their differences. Each one is so unique, you're bound to find one you can't resist and likely, more than one. In WILD, bringing in cousin, Joe, is a &quot;hoot&quot; and keeps our hopes alive that there will be at least one more chance to visit the wonderful Winston men. Great sequel Ms. Foster and looking forward to Joe's story.	2002-10-25

And having absolutely loved her Matrix series (5 stars), I give her a E for effort, but that's all. <br />In this book, which is a sequel to High Energy, the main characters do not meet for the first time. That's because they did that as the main characters in High Energy. The couple's just back for more ... because although they are supposedly \\"in love\\" and definitely \\"in lust\\" with one another, they still aren't married... or are they? This one has lots of sex between the gorgeous physicist and his lover (who's not sure if she wants marriage because she fears their very sexual relationship might change.) So, they have a \\"pretend\\" marriage... where only he knows if it's real or not. HUH? You either said \\"I do\\" or you didn't. Anyway, you -the reader- gets the chance to revisit this couple for another 200+ pages while they continue to have a \\"heated\\" sex life and try to figure out secrets behind a \\"haunted house.\\" Other than a really FAT cat, that's about it.<br />High Energy was a \\"fairly\\" good book, though definitely not Ms. Joy's best. And it's sequel, High Intensity ... sorry, these two characters just aren't interesting enough to warrant another entire book about them.	2002-10-25

Take Delanie, a Kindergarten teacher (who had a 1-night-stand with the \\"Doc\\" a while ago) and have her go undercover as the bad guy's girlfriend in her own private search for her sister. AND have the two meet pool-side with her nearly nude... Yes! The Sparks are sure to fly! This one sizzles with intrigue, action, and romance. A truly enjoyable page-turner.

A tribe-raised orphan, anthropologist, and 29-year-old author on a book tour causes havoc with his slightly-older female escort by stripping down to native garb (OK, a G-string) during his lectures! The college students & public love it - He is gorgeous afterall - But she's supposed to keep him OUT of trouble! Yet, that's impossible when he announces on national TV that he's still a virgin, then later - rather bluntly - proposes to her! His antics are a riot and she may SAY she wants off the job but really, a picture (in his pocket) tells it all, and her heart must face facts. If you want serious mystery, with complex characters and a challenging plot... forget it.

Instead, it is a fast-physically-attracted, faster-to-bed and into-a-steamy-sex-filled-relationship kind of book. Zanita, a reporter hot on a story, pairs up with Tyber, a hunk of a physicist, to uncover a conman. A lot of kooky secondary characters actually help save this book and make it a fairly fun read. Tyber has a math-genius/nut-case as a cook who thinks he's on a pirate ship & Tyber's the Captain. Zani has an even zanier aunt who is deadly to Tyber's Harley. Then, there's the couple's friends, Greg and Mills; two characters who actually make me wish THEY were the focus of this book's sequel.

Of all Ms Quinn's Bridgerton novels, this latest is my favorite... so far. (Although all the others are a very, very, very close 2nd! *grin*) I adored the Prologue: the descriptive way Penelope falls in love is perfect! And the book gets better from there, especially Colin's righteous anger when asking her Mother for Penelope's hand in marriage! I wanted so badly to scream, Yes! With characters like Colin and Penelope, the book can't help but be memorable. Colin is such a \\"nice\\" hero and one couldn't have picked a more deserving heroine than Penelope. I was so glad to see her return so strongly in her own book after being the ever-present, yet seldom appreciated, wall-flower/secondary character in previous Bridgerton novels. And the fact that Colin, as nice as he is, has to eat his own words in the end. Well, who could ask for more? Oh yeah, there is that mysterious sharp-tongued, yet witty, gossip known as Lady Whistledown who's been frankly cutting - although honest - toward Penelope all these years. Well, she's unveiled in this book, which makes it even more worthwhile. (So, not to spoil the surprise, if this is your 1st introduction to the Bridgertons... I'd recommend reading the other books in the series first. Just in case, the order is: The Duke and I, The Viscount Who Loved Me, An Offer From A Gentleman, and then Romancing Mr Bridgerton) They keep getting better and better, which makes me anxious to see how Eloise's story will unfold!	2002-08-27

And I can't think of a guy more deserving of finding love again than the widower, &quot;Admiral.&quot; <br />I'm glad to see a few of Brockmann's original Tall Dark &amp; Dangerous series are being republished, namely books 1 &amp; 2, Prince Joe and Forever Blue. I hope they'll continue and republish all of them. I'd buy them again. Admiral's Bride is #7 in the series. If they don't... and if you can get your hands on this one, it's worth it. Although it's not absolutely necessary, I recommend reading Brockmann's &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot; (book #6 in the series) to get a bit more of the Admiral's history before reading this one. While it's Crash's story, the Admiral and his first love, Daisy, are featured heavily in it.	2002-08-27

Why? Because you get more for your money in Brockmann's books and Unsung Hero is no different. This one, like the others, offers more than a single love story. Sure, it has a modern-day love story between Tom, an injured SEAL on medical leave, and Kelly, a childhood friend-turned-divorced doctor. But, it goes beyond that! (1)with Tom's struggle to retain his position with the SEALs and concerns over his own sanity and health (2) with a possible terrorist threat that may be real or may be Tom's imagination (3) with flash-backs to a WWII buddy story of lost-love involving Tom's great-uncle, Kelly's father and a French widow. (4) and with an added love story sparking between two unlikely youths, one being Tom's neice. Brockmann does a spectacular job of weaving the plots to form a truly enjoyable page-turning novel! It really should have been called Unsung Heroes ... there's more than one character who'll touch your heart in this book.	2002-08-26

I enjoyed the present day adventures of Meg and John, but was even more amazed to find a WWII love story sprinkled throughout the plot that was endearing, thrilling, and actually brought me to tears. As if that's not enough, the sparking antics of secondary characters (FBI agent Locke and Navy SEAL Starrett) was another bonus. I can't wait for their book!<BR>I stongly disagree with the other reviewer who wrote that it was a waste of money and time. I'm glad I took the chance: It was like having two novels and a sneak-peak at a third all in one book! Brockmann does a great job weaving it all together and effectively touching on the differences between life and love in the 40's versus the same in the 90's. The only suggestion I'd make is to change the title to Defiant Heroes! (Plural) Ralph-pronounced Rafe-deserves some credit on the title!:)	2002-06-15

Great Series	Dark Guardian is the latest in Feehan's Dark Series, a great set of romance novels about an \\"Old World\\" immortal, primarily nocturnal species called Carpathians who remain mostly unknown to humans. After a few centuries, the males lose all feelings of emotion, ability to see color, and risk losing their souls by turning into vampires (undead beings without conscience, seeking the thrill of the kill)... unless the men find the light to their darkness... their lifemates (female Carpathians, or psychic human females who can safely be converted to Carpathian without the risk of becoming vampiresses).<br />I love this book --so far my favorite in the series--, but recommend starting at the beginning and moving forward in order: Dark Prince, Dark Desire, Dark Gold, Dark Magic, Dark Challenge, Dark Fire, Dark Legend, Dark Guardian (and the Dark Dream, which is one of three stories in an anthology book entitled After Twilight).<br />My one and only complaint about this whole series is that Ms. Feehan over-uses a favorite catch phrase: He took her breath away... or She took his breath away... or He tells her, \\"You take my breath away.\\" Variations pop up repeatedly in each and every book! After reading 9 books, it gets old quick. But, I've learned to skip it and go on, because the rest is great!	2002-06-06

When one is in need, the others are there - no reason necessary. I bought Cash first, which turned out to be the last of the series - don't you hate it when that happens! ;) - But, I fell in love with the characters and had to learn all of their stories. <br />I recommend you read them in order: Reese, Sullivan, Jed, Rico, Nate, and Cash.<br />If you read only one, Nate is my favorite choice. Primarily, because Ms. Handeland goes beyond your typical love story of a man with a troubled past who finds a woman that captures his heart and teaches him to love again. Nate is a preacher-turned-gunman who, after losing his wife and child, blames himself and loses his faith in God. A former Confederate soldier, he is an alcoholic on the verge of committing suicide when the heroine, a Christian missionary, walks through the door and quite literally turns his life up-side-down.<br />It's a truly touching story and has become one of my favorite romance novels of all time. Thank you Lori for an absolutely inspirational love-story... and to Lori and Linda Devlin (who wrote three of the six books) for a spectacular series. I wish there were more than six!	2002-06-04

The reviewer was wrong; They are two very different books! So, to keep others from \\"killing the cat with curiosity...\\" let me set the record straight.<br />Admittedly, there are some similarities, but NOT \\"everything\\". Both heros are half-cat-half-human with green eye(s) and royal bloodlines. Karic, the hero in Heart's Lair, is heir to the Cat-Man throne and has shoulder-length hair and two green eyes with some gold in them; Gian Ren, in Mine to Take, is the reigning King of all Familiar, has a waste-length mane, one gold eye, and one green eye with 3 gold flecks. Both virgin heroines come to their heros while the men are chained captives, although only one is on a bed at the time; the other has all four limbs bound, forcing him to stand spread-eagle in the middle of the room. In both books the bad guys have \\"new secret weapons\\" but in one it's a drug that proves effective against Gian Ren and in the other it's a mind-controling machine that proves ineffective against Karic. And that's where the similarities end!<br />In Hearts Lair, Karic's first site of Liane is while she's nude, bathing in a pond, not while he's a drugged captive as in the case between Gian Ren and Jenise in Mine to Take. The methods of escape are completely different between the two books. No where does Karic make such an electrically-charged illuminated transformation from man to cat like Gian Ren, nor does Karic benefit from it's healing properties. And Gian Ren doesn't have \\"retractable claws\\" or \\"visual cloaking\\" capabilities while in human form like Karic.<br />But the strongest difference is the first sexual exchange between the main characters of both books. In Hearts Lair, it's rape, with a strong touch of beastiality. In Mine to Take, Jenise demands he take her virginity as part of a bargain, and although Gian Ren complies, technically speaking, he refuses to \\"take his pleasure\\" because --circumstances notwithstanding-- she won't allow him to \\"pleasure her first.\\" ... Hello? BIG difference!<BR>In Hearts Lair, you spend much of the rest of the book watching the two who had loved one another, although not yet admitting it to each other, struggle to overcome that one brutal night. In Mine to Take, the struggle is over the fact that unbeknownst to Jenise, Gian Ren actually \\"marries\\" her that first night through his native ceremony that she's unfamiliar with... no pun intended ;).<br />While I enjoyed both books, and was glad to see two talented writers handle the Cat-Man-type characters so differently, I felt the better of the two is actually Ms. Joy's Mine to Take, with its humorous bits of wit (The Wee-Chuck-Chucks are priceless!!!) and warmly erotic love scenes. Although, you may disagree if you don't like cliff-hangers. Mine to Take is part of an ongoing series so threads of the plot are left untied, while Hearts Lair has closure.	2002-05-19

I certainly never would have thought to write a book that's a mix of Regency England and Amazon-women. In the end, it's an interesting but hard-to-maintain role-reversal concept that lacks believability (But, hey, it's fiction, right? So, 2 stars it is.) <br />I like strong heroines, who give as good as they get. Nothing bothers me more than a woman who lets a man run all over her just because she \\"loves\\" him. But to think of women TOTALLY controlling everything ON BEHALF of men? (Women running all over the men... Even in the reverse, it still bothers me.) Women being the bread-winners? (OK, maybe :) ...) Women as THE protectors of men, despite being the physically weaker sex... (I'm talking physically, not intellectually, here)... and the men actually allowing that... (Not hardly!) <br />It was a good try, and I give her an E for effort, but even Ms. Joy backs down at the end, and the role-reversal concept flip-flops back to \\"HERO - not Heroine - SAVES THE DAY.\\" I mean despite all the heroine's claims of how her role is to take care of and protect her hero, it's not Ms. Joy's heroine who meets her (female) antagonist on the field of battle!<br />Personally, I prefer her Matrix books, and hope the next will be a continuation of that series and not a sequel to this one.	2002-05-19

Still, I bought the book, read it, and am very glad I did. My only real issue with this book (2nd in a series) is that there are a lot of references to people and events in the other books, but having now read the whole series, I can overlook that. And I have to admit I'm anxiously awaiting Traed's story... PLEASE HURRY MS. JOY!<br />Ms. Joy does a great job of making Rejar's character sooo very cat-like, from his mischievous nature as expressed by his \\"thought-provoking sweet nothings\\" to his I'm \\"king of the castle\\" arrogance, ... <br />I'm not bothered by his over-bearing manner toward Lilac--he is part Cat!--and besides there are also plenty of touching scenes, from his appreciation of her sewing talents -- or lack there of :), to his reassuring acceptance of her \\"chatty behavior\\".<br />I found Lilac's innocent naivete refreshing, although I didn't like her gullibility toward that would-be husband-thief especially considering her upset over gossip as a result of her own \\"chatty behavior\\"... She's smarter than that or should be, and lucky her \\"friend\\" has a heart, even if it's a small one. Fortunately, there are glimpses of her strength in character, as evident by her willingness to give the \\"cut-direct\\" (even if it was unsuccessful) and a well-deserved slap, her getting the better of Rejar at dinner (caviar & apples, anyone?), and her stubborn refusal to call Rejar by his real name no matter what he tries \\"physically\\"... ...She's not refusing his sexual advances but rather refusing to accept who he really is. I can excuse Rejar for his anger; I mean, who wouldn't be upset with a mate who refuses to call you by your real name?<br />I would have loved to see Lilac give Rejar a tougher time over all he saw and heard as a cat...before his unveiling...like, maybe offer him some snuff? ;)<br />All in all, I enjoyed the book (the whole series really) which is pleasantly different from the usual romance book. It's introduced me to \\"other worlds\\" and has me thanking Ms. Joy and wishing she'd open the next chapter soon! (Maybe then I'll finally learn just what a zorph is!)	2002-04-25

From the hero's unexpected, yet endearingly touching, kiss to &quot;Miss Jane&quot; to the laughable antics of a sly cat, this book was truly an enjoyable read. I caught myself going from grins to giggles to outright teary-eyed laughter and loving every minute of it. I'm so thankful it's part of a series. One book... for all of these wonderful characters... is just not enough! Thank you Ms. Quinn and please keep them coming!	2002-04-23
