We enjoyed a dozen recipes from this book already and they are easy, easy, easy and so authentic and delicious no one will know you are a) not a chef or b) not Italian. And this is not the usual cookbook. It is filled with stories and customs from the different regions so that you feel that you are really touring Italy. Hence the title (duh!). And then there are meals already organized for things like a bachelor party for 4 (for people without too many friends), a Christmas Day dinner for 12, a Roman lunch for 6, fabulous one-dish meals, so simple. When you read this book, you really feel like you are in Italy. My husband, who thinks making instant oatmeal is cooking, has made some of these recipes and they tasted as interesting and complex as something from a great Italian restaurant. We have given this book to 6 people already as Christmas presents. Who knew we all needed another Italian cookbook. But then this isn't just another Italian cookbook.	2003-12-24

Although Alicia appears quite reckless in her decisions, Tony appears to be a man for whom any woman would bend the rules.

It is a different book with a different kind of love story and there are no lulls in the story. No dry spots when you can put the book down and tend to something important to do like go to the office or buy food or shower. Find a nice quiet day when no one expects anything from you and read it. It is written so well, the characters are so delightful and honest and even though there are no really sensual love scenes it is one of the most romantic books you will read. I'd say it goes on the keeper shelf.	2003-07-01

The only really disappointing thing about this particular printing is the lack of respect for the written word. Whoever is responsible for printing this edition (eread.com) should be ashamed of themselves. I have never seen so many typos in anything. There must be well over a hundred mistakes in this book. Sometimes two and three on a page. Some of these mistakes made it hard to understand the intent of the author. Really a mess. If you can find an old issue read that.

It's not really a conventional romance novel. It breaks a lot of &quot;rules&quot;. But both characters are amazingly drawn out and they are perfect for each other. She can hold up against him and never loses her dignity or her strength of character. He is just a dream come true. This book is written lovingly with a swift moving story, no dead spots, excellent love scenes, a nice element of mystery and a highly emotional fast-paced conclusion. In a year I will read it again.

Her two contemporary books (this one and The Mating Game which I could even finish) lack the writing style, the witty dialogue, the great characters.

Merry Vance was smart and independent and Nicolas Craven was very sexy and tender. It was interesting from the start, not a slow, tedious beginning until you get to the good stuff. It was a delight all the way through. The love scenes are generally passionate but not too erotic for this period (although it does get a little explicit in some places). I tried to read Menage but it was too much mindless sex for me. This book has heart, it has romance, it has good dialogue. It's a great read.	2002-06-11

But if you missed &quot;Passion's Treasure&quot; and can't find it, this is a book worth reading. It is an unusual story about a child prodigy, a Thinker, who crosses paths with a heartless young  squire. How they change and enrich each other's lives is a fast-paced, often humorous (not silly) passionate tale. Treasure Barrett is a thoroughly delightful heroine and Sterling Renville is a masterful interesting young man, even when he is at his worst. Since this is the first novel of Betina Krahn's I have read I have nothing of hers to compare it with, but I did order all of her books based on this one. This author can write. There are some Romance writers who tell good stories and others who can write. This one does it all.	2002-06-01

Once Caleb comes on the scene things pick up. This is a heart-breaking storyline in many ways and the secondary characters are vividly portrayed to great detail. It is probably one of the more powerful stories of love and second chances and redemption.(The House of Gentle Men by Kathy Hepinstall is another remarkable story that you will never forget.)<br />It's a pleasure to read all of Ms. London's books. There is nothing frivolous or wimpering about her writing style and her ability to tell a whopping good story. You can see why she doesn't spew these books out as fast as some other authors do. Her work is very well crafted and her characters are carefully drawn out. The sex is pretty good, too.<br />However, I also hated the Epilogue. Don't read it.	2002-05-03

I only hated the times I had to put it down. This is a sweet story (maybe it is like &quot;White Lies&quot; but not enough to make a difference), written with great wit and imagination. Both main characters (Enid and MacLean) are delightful and the dialogue is only surpassed by the most sensual love scenes allowed without slipping into erotica.

I would have given this book less of a rating except for the fact that I did finish it. Lollie is so inept it was painful and Sam is so mean and verbally abusive to her, calling her stupid all the time, even when he is supposed to be falling in love with her. Except for the fact that he is always there to save her from her ineptitude, this man is a brute and has very little redeeming features. Poor Lollie never seems to improve and her accidents are not very funny. Why these two people wind up together is a mystery. Don't like dumb women, don't like mean-spirited men.	2002-02-26

Certainly equal to Ms. Cabot's other books which are all must-reads. Lady of Skye may have some historical flaws in it (who cares, really) but the witty, bouncy dialogue and the delightful characterisations of the main protagonists as well as the secondary players put a smile on my lips throughout the book. I was very sad to see it end and even sadder since there are no more Patricia Cabot books left for me to read. During a difficult, miserable economy and a stressful job, books like these lift me up and out and the escape, though momentary, is welcome. I don't know why everyone didn't love this book. I guess that's what makes horse racing - a difference of opinion.	2002-02-22

After reading this book, I re-read all these low-rated reviews and I wonder...what book where these people reading? This is a good, page-turner. You will hate putting it down and love picking it up again. It's a romance novel! I almost didn't read this because of the comments. There is no rape in the book, the hero is heroic and the mean actions of some of the characters are not overwhelming. One of them is hateful, the others are just misguided due to ignorance. It's a good lesson from the &quot;What doesn't kill us makes us stronger&quot; school of character development. It's a good read, it's fun, it has a lot of good sex and it's not too long.

This is not one of her better books. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot (which looked promising) became implausible quickly and got worse as the book went on. (I'm angry at myself for finishing it when I knew it was poorly written within the first 100 pages.) Patch is an interesting woman but Ethan's character has no real focus. The recovery of the victim in the crime Ethan is wrongly accused of is so sudden and happens so easily you wonder what took 17 years!?<br />The cover promises &quot;an amusing and imaginative romp&quot; from Affaire de Coeur but if you want this kind of read try Julia Quinn, Sabrina Jeffries, Julia London (all 5 of her books are wonderful), Kinley MacGregor, Maggie Osborne (anything written AFTER 1993), Gaelen Foley.

As with the first book in this series of three sisters (A Dangerous Love) it's about unconventional pairings in a sweet love story. Ms Jeffries writes about interesting, feisty women and loving, strong-minded men. She doesn't bore the reader with pages of descriptions that are not relevant to moving the tale along. Her love scenes are provocative but still romantic and believable. As Rosalind and Griff were good together in Number One, Helena and Daniel are perfect in Number Two. We are all guessing...SEQUEL and Number Three has got to be about Juliet and her mysterious captor/savior Morgan Pryce. Ms. Jeffries other books are good, too. She has a nice sense of humor and her books are a joy to read. You can't go wrong.	2001-10-27

Ordered and read whatever books were still in print and then started tracking down out-of-print books. The consensus among fans seems to be that the early books can't hold a candle to the ones written after 1985 or thereabouts. Certainly her later books (Jenny Jones, A Stranger's Wife, Brides of Prairie Gold, Seduction of Samantha Kincaide, Silver Lining, The Best Man and The Wives of Bowie Stone to name a few)represent Ms. Osborne's very best work. These books each have original storylines and characters that stay with you long after the books are finished. She is truly one of the best writers in this genre that we have. <br />But this early book, Rage to Love, is worth reading. The lady of the book, Garnet Winters, makes so many errors in judgment you may want to shake her sometimes, but her heart is in the right place and she matures throughout the short time frame of the book. On the other hand, the hero, Jean Belaine is the ideal man. Phew! He is hot! And what an ending.<br />The story of slave labor on sugar plantations in the French Caribbean around the time of the French Revolution is often brutal and many sections are hard to read they are so graphic, but the message is very relevant to our times today and the story never falters. It is a page turner and a unique story in almost every respect. <br />If these books are ever reprinted it would be good to have the covers more in line with the more recent books. The old books look like bodice-rippers and this doesn't do them justice. If you are a Maggie Osborne fan, this is another one of her books that should be read. (Couldn't get into Yankee Princess, though, no matter how hard I tried. Maybe later.)	2001-09-17

If Ms Hepinstall doesn't win a Pulitzer for this book I would be amazed. The characters are richly depicted, the narrative is so lovingly crafted it was hard to set the book aside. I couldn't be away from it for very long. I think the people who rated this novel with less than 5 stars were taking the story too literally. There is a bigger message here than how a young woman survives a brutal attack or how a young man survives his guilt. It is about redemption and love and kindness. If they made this into a film and captured the poignancy of &quot;Cedar House Rules&quot; it would be a lovely, classic film for everyone who has a heart and a soul. Can't wait for her next novel.	2001-08-30

I usually don't like short contemporary stories because they cut to the finish too quickly and it's so good the enjoy the chase. But this book is different and now I'm going to read more of Foster's books. It's a sweet story about two people who don't realize how lonely and needy they are until they agree to a &quot;business proposition&quot; that involves a baby. It was a nice break from historical and Regency romances where the sexual tension can go on and on and on. These two characters know what they want from the beginning and the fun of the book is watching how they fumble their way through to true love. You can read it in a night and it leaves you smiling. For the kind of book it is, I'd give it 5 stars.	2001-07-21

This, her final book in the Rogues series, is as good if not even better than the first two. There are no dead spots in this book, just a few chapters at the start to put the scenario in place and then it is non-stop delight to the very last page. Arthur is a true heartthrob and Kerry is a smart, witty, delightful heroine. All the characters are well thought-out and depicted with affection and detail. The love scenes are sensual but done with impeccable taste. The very original plot is smart and not cliche-ridden. It is an emotional roller coaster, especially the last few chapters. I read it in two days. And I was busy at work!<br />The only drawback to a writer who consistently hits it out of the park like Ms. London is that she truly crafts her novels and that takes time. How we all wish we could enjoy one of her books every month. But...she is well worth the wait.	2001-07-11

This is a very gifted author and all her books should be read (I think in the order she has written them). Unfortunately there are only four books right now, but we can only hope that she is as prolific as she is gifted. Her characters are so well drawn out you can actually remember them. Her secondary characters are also rich and vibrant. Her dialogue is wonderful and her prose is unique and highly-charged emotionally whether she is describing a thought or a sensuous love scene.

(I read it in a weekend and stopped only long enough to ride our horses.) There is no &quot;fat&quot; in the writing. Every page, every line moves the story along until you are just swept away with the main characters. Hart and Mercy are the perfect romance leads. He is brave and tortured, she is smart and unconventional. Ms. Brockway writes delightful dialogue with lines like this: After a particularly rough seduction Mercy says to a distraught Hart, &quot;If you've come to apologize, I will kill you. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but someday, somehow, I'll shoot you.&quot; Made all the more poignant since she is a remarkable marksman. What a woman! All Ms Brockway's books are exceptional, each in their own way. This one is different as well. Hart is a little over-enthusiastic in his desires for Mercy, but she doesn't seem to mind and neither did I. It's a great read.	2001-02-19

It is a charming story of a man (Nicholas) who is intent on denying his growing affections for a feisty, engaging, outspoken young woman (Summer) who won't take no for an answer. Their battle of wits and emotions is both delightful and touching. Do not pass over the poem at the beginning of the book. I am now reading &quot;Renegade Love&quot; and although it is good, it does not move as swiftly as &quot;Dream Fever&quot;. Try to find it since it's out of print.	2001-01-07

It's a page-turner and it stays with you long after you've finished it. Morgan Kane is a hero you won't forget. &quot;Notorious&quot; is also a cut above average. Ms Sutcliffe's writing, character development, dialogue and plots are really excellent...so far. Can't wait to read another of her books.	2000-12-30

I could not put this book down. There's no skimming pages here, skimming paragraphs or skipping lines, you will read every word of this story and be richly rewarded for it. Hawk is one of the great romantic heroes and Belinda Hamilton is everything you want and need a heroine to be. These two burn up the pages together. I only regret that Ms. Foley's next two books won't be out until 2002. It's too long to wait for an exceptional author who is nothing less than delightful	2000-12-08

This one is a lovely love story that you will not be able to put down. I think I read it in two days. On vacation. With a husband around. The second was &quot;Heaven Forbids.&quot; Quite different and wonderfully written with enough pathos to break your heart, but not enough to be maudlin. But read this one first. &quot;After the Kiss&quot; is what romance novels should be, written by a clearly talented writer who will not disappoint her readers.	2000-11-23

It is full of homes with great bones and lovely details. One is more striking than the other. The photography is excellent, but what makes it different is that these are homes with a wonderful marriage of traditional lines and contemporary design. This is a book for people with a very refined taste in architecture.	2000-11-12

The story has a contemporary theme which was refreshing (heroine in danger rescued by the hero themes were wearing thin). This is a story about a struggle between a man's ambition and his heart. Griff is a wonderful hero and Rosalind is a perfect mate to his ego and his passion. The secondary characters, Daniel and Helena, are also interesting and I wished their story had been given a little more attention. But the book is not flawed in that regard and as busy as I was this weekend, I finished the book in three nights. Now I'm tired, but it was worth it.	2000-11-04

I bought this book and didn't read it for a while because I thought the cover was silly. It turned out to be one of the better ones. I think I read it in two days...and I should have been doing other things! The best thing I can say about this one is that it's really a shame Ms. Bennet (aka Ms Karen Hawkins) doesn't write more books faster. She is a delightful storyteller, her heroine is charming and smart and feisty, her hero is deliciously different. Read the book. Read all her books when she finally gets to writing them.	2000-10-08

(The first &quot;erotic&quot; anthology from these gifted women authors &quot;Captivated&quot; was also quite good.) This book is worth buying for the Robin Schone story alone (although the other three make very good reading). The last story, however, about a widow and a eunuch, is original, touching and will stay with you. Very often these novels are fun to read for the moment but then the plot escapes you. This one will never leave you.	2000-09-30

The only surprising factor here is that it appears to be her very first. Jack  is everything a romantic hero should be and his Kit is a delightful  scallywag of a heroine. Their adventures and love affair is fun, witty,  sensuous and wildly sexy. I was sad to see it end. I would give it six  stars.	2000-08-11

The characters are beautifully written, the love scenes are pretty steamy and the point of the book is well taken. You will really be anxious to read more of this  author's work. The only bummer here is that most of the rest of Nicole  Jordan's books are out of print, and they tend to be expensive. Maybe some  enterprising publisher will re-publish her body of work. If the rest of her  books are like this one they should sell well.	2000-06-08

I don't know why I went through so much trouble to get this book on auction, but my instincts were rewarded from its first page through its last sentence. This book, released in 1989 was dedicated to the combat  veterans of Viet Nam, something I didn't see until I finished the book. The  hero, Sheridan Drake...a most intriguing, battle-scarred fallen angel...is  suffering from emotional wounds most of us can't even fathom, and yet we  can identify with him and understand his anguish. His tenderness for his  princess, Olympia, is all at once brave, touching, flawed and  unforgettable. I wish they would reprint this book so that more people  could read it. There are so many good parts to this tale, but the time they  spend on the island is priceless and written with great appeal. I don't  normally read books twice, but this one will get read again one day. It's  funny, sad, moving, exciting and a great read. It's one of her best.	2000-01-22

Billy Darling is the quintessential romantic hero. He's tough, honest, sexy, misunderstood, underestimated and a great lover. Esmerelda is a good match  for him. The plot is good, the dialogue is fun, the love scenes are  perfect. I was really sorry to finish this book.	1999-12-16

This is a very sweet story of a man with a secret huge heart and a woman who saves him. To say that the hero has a lot of children is an understatement - he's got ALL the children. A dozen of them. How he got  them and how he learns to love them is part of the plot. It's a lovely book  and a good introduction to this inventive author. It's also pretty funny. A  good read.	1999-12-16

Of course the hero and the heroine are really the same in all the books but that just makes them more fun to keep reading. The women are  sounky and quirky and the men are patient and witty. I wish she'd written  more of these. &quot;With This Ring&quot; and &quot;I Thee Wed&quot; are  also fun, but they are different than the One-Words. I wish she'd write  more of them.	1999-11-20

The characters are extremely well drawn out, the love scenes are tender and erotic and the dialog is fun. Her second book &quot;Stargazer&quot; is also  very original.	1999-11-16
