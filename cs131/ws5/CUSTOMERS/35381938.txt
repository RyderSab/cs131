It was a wonderful book that had a lot of passion and reality in it (which is hard to find in a romance sometimes).  There were things that I could have lived with out, that didn't seem to be needed in the book in the long run, and there were some loose ties that left a bad taste in my mouth.  But that was a minute part of the book compaired to all the good stuff in it. Give it a try, you might be pleasently suprised, I was.	2003-12-31

NOPE! I got a sweet little romance of tattered souls, I didn't WANT that!  I didn't pay for that.  Look at Beyond Suduction for an amazing Emma Holly book, but skip this one if you're looking for a shock.	2003-10-05

I did like this book, I finished the book three days after I started it!  I thought it was great.  But.....I HATED the ending.  If you read the book you will understand.  I still don't get it.  I can come up with half a dozen other endings and that says to me that she could have tried harder.  It just left a bad taste.<br />If you are looking for a truly unique book by this author, Please, go check out Warrior's Woman.  I LOVED this book.	2003-08-15

US	35381938	R20LCPCVQKKVVP	0451203828	520217716	Midnight Falcon	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Unique idea, not a nice fit,	This story lacked so much it's hard to pin point just where it went wrong.  But the likelihood of this union happening is too great that it makes you want to cringe.  It just would have never happened.  The main characters seen to love each other with 100% faith one moment and doubt there entire love the next.  Everything is made right with a few words and some violence.  It was shallow with loving words and a pretty picture.<br />To give the author a slight benefit of the doubt, this was one of the first books I have read by her.  But I have read many romance books and this just wasn't a great one.  When I read a book I want to be swept away, I want to feel for the characters and fight for them.  I just wanted this book to end.  In most books I  worried about what's going to happen to them next because I don't want anything to happen to the pair, in this book I worried about what's going to happen next because I didn't want the book to drag on.  <br />My advice: take your money and go buy a Julie Garwood book.	2003-08-03
