Classy, yet sassy, Ms. McElroy clearly lays out the techniques, do's and dont's when the goal is a \\"trophy man.\\" What's most important is that she stresses to us to not lower our standards, tell the men what our expectations are upfront and to carry yourself like the lady you are (or should be at this time). It gives me hope for the future and gives me pointers on how to achieve that dream. Finally, a sister is letting other sisters know that we can aspire to what we truly want and deserve. If you dare to have standards and want to attract a man that is a true one in every sense of the word, then this book is for you. If you still enjoy wasting time w/ the bottom feeders/momma's boys/scrubs/thugs/bums, then leave this book alone: better yet, pass it on to your smarter, enlightened friends. Thanks Ms. McElroy, for such a gift!!!	2002-10-28

I was in such a relationship with my ex-husband, and it took years to discover that his problems/projections were becoming mine. This book would've helped me determine that much sooner. My only complaint is that the book could be more concisely written: it can be hard to understand at times, and I'm a professional writer myself. Ms. Evans is to be applauded, however, for her insight and for what she imparts throughout: that the abused is not at fault and that the behavior isn't to be tolerated. If you know someone who's subjected to this type of behavior, this book will help tremendously. Spread the knowledge and make a difference in someone's life.	2002-10-22

Lansdale is the down-home verison of Stephen King (no affront to either author): with his own distinct regional dialect, he lures you into his web like a seasoned spider and doesn't let up until you're completely entangled. The characters are well-written, the story all-too-real and the climax was unbelievable. Mr. Lansdale's gift is that he tells a compelling tale without being sensationalist: his thoughtful, reflective tone is what keeps you hooked. It is dark and brooding, but excellent.  I recommend this for those who enjoy compelling literature and anyone who fancies themselves fans of his work. Mr. Lansdale has earned yet another follower in me.	2002-05-21

These two licensed professional counselors are men themselves, and their experience and professional knowledge bring much enlightenment to the mystery of men's behavior in relationships. I highly recommend this book to those who have been led to falsely believe that all men are commitment-phobic slugs and want validation to seek emotionally mature men that embrace confident, mature women for what they bring to the union. It offers tips on how ladies can come into their own power and to take assured chances with the opposite sex. Very concise, easy to read and well-written.	2002-05-15

This novel would've ran better if he had followed things up in more sequential order, and explained the butler/gatekeeper and the girl, but the way it isn't just isn't worth sloshing through. My head hurt at the end, and I felt cheated with what all was left out. This premise had possibilities, but for the most part, feels \\"phoned in\\": even his most hardcore fans wouldn't feel this book, I dare say. If you're new to Bentley, this book does him NO justice.

She isn't as light-hearted as Michelle Mckinney Hammond, but her maternal tone is just as warm and more effective in some cases. She offers prayers geared toward each affirmation and gives simple exercises as well. For those who are laboring undering the belief that you are doomed to stay single for life, you will take heart in recieving biblically supported advice from a MARRIED woman who has walked the walk, talked the talk and ended up with a loving, Christian husband in the end.

If we are to receive the destined mates that will adore us and love us in the way that the Lord wants us to be, then we need to follow His plan by, essentially, submitting to His judgement, fulfilling his destiny for us and TRUSTING THE LORD TO DELIVER THE MAN WHEN HE THE BOTH OF US ARE READY.

As soon as I learned that the baby I was carrying was a boy, I instinctively knew that I have to foster the &quot;state of emergency&quot; frame of mind to make him into the shining Black Prince that I wanted him to be, and this book will push you on that path from the jump. It encourages, enlightens and spells out the solutions to keep your precious son on the right path. Nearly every possible scenario is touched on here: encouragement to single mothers and fathers and tips on the ex, homosexuality, the doomed &quot;raise the daughters love the sons&quot; mentality, how to teach him to live in a sometimes hostile, racist world while maintaining self-dignity and respect for others, how not to allow himself to get &quot;dumbed down&quot; by peers, avoiding the temptation of drugs and gangs,etc. This book has more info than you would expect one source to have, and it helped me to understand that raising a responsible, loving, respectful young Black man doesn't have to be a pipedream. If you want to help avert crises before they occur, or need help throughout the one you may in the midst of, this book is priceless.

If you, like me, prefer a straight-forward approach, then read &quot;Single Mamahood&quot; by Kelli Willams and save &quot;High Road&quot; for the more serene, spiritual moments when you have time for all the lists, mantras, mediation exercises, candles, visualization, etc, etc, etc.	2001-09-03

Throught lists, charts, statistics, exercises and the emphasis on personal empowerment, Ms. Chapman tells us both that ultimately, we BOTH have a lot of work to do, but that it is not impossible, and that we do need to step up to the plate for ourselves and for future generations. Yes, the title is a turn-off, but don't let that deter you from using the knowledge in this book to make your relationship w/ the opposite sex---and yourself---better than you imagined possible.

This book, writen from a frank, but Christian perspective, lists the types on men to avoid, what they look for in a partner/victim, why the women themselves are drawn to these losers and how to work through the issues to eventually create a better relationship (except if the man is violent). The 2 end chapters also give tips on how to steer clear of &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; to begin with and hope on making the existing relationship a healthier one. Mr. Arterburn's disclosure of his past mistakes, dry humor and case scenarios make this book a must-read for women who want to empower themselves, gain insight into these types of &quot;men&quot; and start on the path to &quot;Mr. Right&quot;, and it will help the men who are open-minded enough to want to correct their flaws.

Denene and Nick, a happily married couple, decided that the way they do things and their collective experiences would be a good tool with which others could navigate their own relationships, and for the most part, they do have stimulating observations/scenarios/suggestions. However, the constant over-use of &quot;ebonics&quot; will become tedious and work your last nerve: it almost undermines the seriousness of the points that they're trying to get across, since, as a general rule, we don't all use that type of slang 24/7 in everyday conversation (at least I and other Blacks I know don't): maybe they thought people could relate better and/or consider them more &quot;down&quot;...either way, it's distracting and unnecessary.     Furthermore, unlike the title states, they don't delve fully into the serious &quot;money power and respect&quot; issues that we all have had experience with, from how some brothers decide to be &quot;scrubs&quot; and/or don't want to take the necessary weight in the relationship/household, why some sisters put up with that tired mess (and perpetuate it by the way they raise the daughters and spoil the sons), why some men think it's cool for them to be constantly &quot;in-between jobs&quot; while their women are automatic &quot;gold-diggers&quot; if they don't work for any extended period (even Mr. Chiles really didn't have any illuminating responses to that point), etc. I bought the book looking for insight into that sort of thinking, and got nothing but opinions/banter/ebonics. In conclusion, if you like their style and think that their marriage is the blueprint you want to copy, then I guess this would be a good book for you. But for those who want deeper understanding in a more &quot;adult&quot; format, hard-hitting facts and lessons that put your new-found knowledge into practice, please run and get any book by Audrey B. Chapman: she has mind-blowing exercises and perspectives on our relationships that point out the issues and give us the road map on how to get there BY PROMOTING DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF SELF, not cutesy slang or straight opinion that simply slap a band-aid on the festering wounds that kill Black relationships today.	2001-07-21

Malcom X, in my humble opinion, was one of the greatest Black minds/men to ever grace the earth. Reading this book not only broadened my views of racism and its role in the shaping of our world, it was also the starting point of a new-found pride in my heritage: I no longer cared what the origin of my last name was, and I cut the perm off my hair to finally embrace the uniqueness that my Black genes afforded me. And by learning his backround and experience, I ultimately understood that it IS possible for a Black man to rise out of the ashes of drug abuse/criminal activity to become the king he was destined to be all along. In fact, Malcolm's character and perserverance, rising like the fiery Phoenix out of the ashes of opression, never fails to encourage and inspire me, and gives me hope for the future. He is one of the most pivotal figures in our collective history, and this book should be required reading for anyone of any color. &quot;Our Shining Black Prince&quot; deserves no less a tribute to the life he led and the legacy he left behind.

Ms. Norwood's book does indeed have useful information, exercises and case scenarios for women in relationship crises (readers will probably relate better to the histories, even if they are fabricated) with self-absorbed, distant, emotional vampires and how to find the self-love and healing required to get rid of them: the problem is in getting past the dry, overly-worded, rambling text to glean out the lessons. Although I learned a lot and consider the book valuable, women who don't have a lot of free time or a long attention span will probably get too impatient to benefit from it and quit. For those who don't mind the excessive verbalizing, this is a good tool to re-vamp your life as you relate to your partner(s) and can help future relationships, but for those of us with jobs/kids/lives, please read &quot;Men Who Hate Women&quot; by Dr. Susan Forward, who is more succinct and includes truthful case scenarios with women and men that can lead to insight and ultimately, healing (hint: in future reprintings, could this get EDITED any better to help the next generation?

In often humorous ways, Haki breaks down what the issues are, where the solutions lie and what we should demand of each other in our collective struggle (from our Black mates, children, leaders, etc.). He does all of this without being condescending or pious, but stern and loving, an accomplishment in itself, and I recommend this to any Black person commited to the struggle to make lives better for Blacks in this country as a whole, starting in their own backyards.

Her &quot;principles,&quot; which basically explain the biblical and common sense that we lost sight of in &quot;modern&quot; times, do nothing less than honor the woman and seek to put her in her rightful place: the apple of the man's eye, the queen on her throne next to the king.

I immediately loved Mama Day and her family: the sweet, long-suffering grandmother, Abigail, the independent, defiant niece, Co Co and her husband George. her descriptions of it all are so well-developed and so authentic, you feel that you could just secure a map and drive out there yourself, fully expecting to greet them all with a wave and make instant friends. There are so many timeless touches, yet it's as modern as if she wrote it last month. If you adore well-written fiction and love a serious romance besides, the book is a necessity that you will turn to over and over and over again, as you'll discover a new jewel each and everytime.

I've been wearing locks for over 2 years, and do so simply because I wanted to wear my natual hair in a flattering, manageable way that honors its texture and the sense of pride I have celebrating my unique African-American features: the way some of the wearers come across in this book is that people who choose to wear locks for these reasons are ignorant frauds, intent on picking and choosing from an honored way of life simply to seem &quot;down&quot;. Is it a problem if people like the way they look and want the dreads for that reason? Do we all have to shun soap/shampoo/locticians/any appearance of uniform size to be &quot;real&quot;? The look may have originated with the Rastas, but just because you're not Rasta when you grow them doesn't mean that you're mocking the way of life or that you don't have a bond with your locks, just like those who wear relaxers don't necessarily want to be white or hate themselves. The overall arrogant, pious &quot;My locks are more sacred than thou's&quot; tone offended me when I thought it would re-affirm the beauty I find in dreads.

I was hooked from the intro and stayed that way: Max and Carole-Anne had a bond that you felt and rooted for, and women cannot help but relate to the sister so low in self-esteem that she doubts true love when it shows its face and manages to throw it  away, all the while causing what she feared the most: the loss of true love. Max is so caught up in his own unresolved issues with his ex that he couldn't see hers and eerily played a part in the relationhip's sabotage. I related with her (as a single momma), was exasperated with her, and in the end, applauded her, since she pulled herself up from her bootstraps, looked her demons in the face and learned from her mistakes, a lesson that some of us are afraid to learn and/or implement too late. This is the first book I've read from Ms. Hodge, but it will not be my last. The novel is moving, realistic and parts will cut the reader to the core. For those who are doubtful that love will find them, or feel that life has painted them into a corner, this book will uplift and inspire you to believe in new possibilities again. EXCELLENT romance novel that will have you going back for more!!	2001-06-28

This simple, yet heart-warming book has short little affirmations for each and every situation that touches sisters today, from the pain of death and disappointment to the joy of celebrating yourself on a constant, daily basis. Not to debase Julia's contribution by comparison, but think of it as shorter,to-the-point &quot;faith in the valley&quot;. In the back, it even allows the reader to have &quot;the last word&quot; as there are blank pages for your own thoughts or mantras. This book can be ab instant pick-me-up and a great gift to the struggling sister in your life.	2001-06-28

T D Jakes is one of the few men who genuines loves, cherishes and adores women in the biblical sense, and when a woman who's been treated less than precious reads this book, she will QUAKE. This man, using biblical examples and beautiful imagery, breaks down that the trinity must work together to make a loving, healthy relationship. His message to women is to cherish yourself and your Divine purpose, to find men who will fall in line with that and how the Lord can ease the burdens for both. Jakes' words make you feel so beautiful and divine that you can't help but seek out a brother who can come correct, and he breaks down how God fits into it all. A beautiful, beautiful book with many necessary truths and advice on how faith and the Lord can lead the way to relationships we deserve.

If you or a woman you know is stuck in the middle or ready to kick him to the curb but just need encouragement, this book is a MUST!!

Ms. Millner's book was informative, insightful and downright hilarious!!! I'm &quot;back on the market&quot; and got her book b/c I didn't want to make the same mistake twice, and I've learned that I'm on the right track. The only things that bothered me were her insinuations throughout &quot;...Rules&quot; that sex is a given in this day and age with or without a commited relationship(it's NOT!!!), that it's cool to shack up (like you 2 won't change anymore when the marriage certificate is signed), and there were NO TIPS OR POINTERS WHATSOEVER FOR SINGLE MOTHERS, WHICH COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF THE SISTERS!! AND HOW ABOUT HOW TO DEAL W/ THE BROTHERS W/ KIDS???!!! Nothing about those topics...zero, zilch, NADA!!! Don't get me wrong: it's a wonderful book that I'm glad to have, and a lot of it is essential for dealing with brothers today (particularly sisters shallow enough to only look for beamers and benzes, those who think their weave needs to be tightened before a brother will speak to them, etc.), but I will have to just pick and choose what I feel comfortable with and look for other sources when it comes to single mother dating advice. thanks Ms. Millner though, for a great start!!!	2001-06-02

With the precision of neurosurgeons, Midge and Kathy cut into our minds and expose to the light all of the prejudices, notions, beliefs, etc, the White and Black women have about each other, from the skin we're in, the hair we wear, to the interracial dating thing (OUCH!!!). Both authors weave factual information with personal stories and accounts from other women of both races, and the book is an all-over good read: it's a brave endeavor by 2 races of women to form new bridges of understanding over very, very troubled waters. If you have a friend of the opposite race and there are &quot;issues&quot; between you, perhaps this book can break down the reasons and solutions and let it be known that women need other women, period, in this &quot;man's world.&quot; Insightful AND essential.	2001-06-02

I found Lena's book to be right on the money, esp. since I have experienced many of the situations myself (&quot;you speak so well,&quot; &quot;what do you think about so-and-so,&quot; &quot;can I touch your hair?&quot;, etc.). Not only does she break down the misconceptions, she also gets down to the origins of them, which was educating as well. The gist of it is that the more these things are put out on the table, the more we all can benefit, since, like it or not, this is a world full of people who live/eat/look/talk/dance/believe differently from each other, and accepting that will make it easier in the long run. More work will have to be put in by the Whites, I believe, since the majority has been accustomed so long to having things &quot;their way&quot; and really not been expected to realize other points of view by minorites. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to &quot;free their minds&quot; and enlighten themselves on racial issues in the world today: if you recognize something that you do which irks the other race, make a decision to learn from it and change, which is what the book is all about. Excellent reading,although the hair issue could've been touched on more: maybe it's because the author herself has a perm and didn't really want to &quot;go there&quot;.

Ms. D does have good quizzes and case histories to help you through the relationship pitfalls, but sometimes the problems go deeper than mere &quot;communication&quot; or sexual styles. Sometimes the cultural  upbringing has a lot to do with it, like w/ the &quot;in-law&quot; section,  for example. A White woman might approach her daughter-in-law differently  than a Black Woman would, because of different societal and cultural  expectations of their sons, and on it goes. I know she couldn't possibly  touch on everything, but to dig deeper into the different upbringings,  rules, etc., would've been more helpful, becuase all of that shades the  relationship somehow. This book, however, is a great start.	1999-06-19

Diana Ross, stung by all of the juicy insider gossip and unauthorized biographies, wanted to sit down and tell her own side of the tale. The only problem with that is, she took the word too literally. While she does give  little-known family anecdotes and photographs, she manages to smooth over  every negative aspect of anything without seeming to own up to her part in  it, or even acknowledging that some fault (or bad judgment, youthful  naivete, whatever) of hers even exists. She treats the late Florence  Ballard's alcoholism like it was a character flaw, like she and Berry  played no part in her eventual destruction. And when she brings up leaving  Motown or the Supremes, she waxes rhapsody like it was just a learning  experience and not an attempt at (music) world domination. The result is  that she paints herself to be a saint and makes her mistakes look even  worse, almost as if she thinks that people who followed her career, fans or  not, are stupid enough to believe in her &quot;innocence&quot;. By  attempting to hide the ugly parts, Ms. Ross only magnifies her  self-deluding tendencies and she takes absolutely no responsibility for her  wrongdoings, something that she should be confident enough to do at this  stage in life. But since she isn't, this book is nothing but a fairy tale.  If you want the REAL deal, check out &quot;Call Her Miss Ross&quot; and  read the quotation from her at the beginning. It sums up her attitude  completely. Nice try, Diana.	1999-06-18

She takes  the time to explore the issues from the Black female/Black male point of  view, and offers gentle, compassionate advice that uplifts all and insults  none. If you have given up on Black men/Black women and feel as if you have  to go it alone or &quot;cross over&quot; to find a good relationship, then  this book is for you. It can also help you to repair a worsening  relationship by helping to confront the real issues surrounding it. This is  easily worth 10 times more than what you may pay for it, and should be THE  definitive book for Blacks trying to have a decent, honest, loving union.

The movie is  as about as realistic as they can make a King book (except for the ending,  which is 100% Hollywood...but you can't have everything, can you?) and  worth a look too. Stunning.	1999-03-28

Think of this book as the long way around the points given in &quot;Faith In The Valley&quot;: on one hand, if some of those weren't expained enough for you, this book breaks them all down. On the other hand, if you're  impatient or have a short attention span, save it for a rainy day or the  line @ the DMV. It's chock full of empowering points and lovingly  explained, taking nothing for granted and guiding you all the way.  &quot;Value&quot; is a treasure, and can actually help you get out of those  ruts and start on your individual issues. Iyanla is like your favorite,  non-judgmental aunt, and we're blessed that she's sharing her observations  from the trenches with us. You GO Iylana: keep that knowledge flowing!!!	1999-03-28

This book is the BIBLE of dysfunctional relationships: Dr. Forward is simultaneously empowering and sympathetic as she lays out the anatomy of misogynists and how they strip the power from their &quot;loved&quot; ones  by slowly corroding their self-esteem and reflecting THEIR problems onto  HER. Her advice and techniques gave me more ways to get a point across, and  to keep my focus and realize, most importantly, to NEVER, EVER blame myself  for his shortcomings and how his backround is coloring things. I could  almost kiss her for giving me that. I've given this book to other women in  similiar straits, and it can be a LIFESAVER!!! If you find that your man  goes from treating you like class to trash for no reason, or you want to  avoid that cliff before you reach it, THIS BOOK IS IT. Thank you, Dr.  Forward, for giving me confidence in my own instincts. And men, if you  recognize yourself and want to shape up before getting kicked to the curb,  then this book is for you too. If this book was required reading before  issuing marriage licenses, there wouldn't be such a high divorce rate. Turn  the tide in your life and GET THE BOOK...it may be the best investment in  yourself and your relationship you've ever made.	1999-03-13

I have all of Ms. Jenkins' books (except &quot;Vivid&quot;...can someone PLEASE give a sister the hook-up??? I can't find it ANYWHERE!!!), and this one was worth the wait. Hester had such a hard life, but she still kept her  principles and fought for the cause (I was really impressed that she  wouldn't even use sugar.). Galen was THE dream man: he diidn't stand for  ignorant bougie attitudes, he was hard-working, loyal, and he loved him  some Hester!!! That church moment was beautiful. The ending, her X-mas  gift, brought me to happy tears. I loved this book, and I could really  relate to her. And, as always, I got schooled on my history. I wouldn't  live in those times for anything, but to have that kind of love would be  priceless. If you love against-all-odds stories, then &quot;Indigo&quot; is  what you need. It is the BOMB!!! (If anyone can send me a copy of  &quot;Vivid&quot;--I'll pay, of course--hit me  @agirlcalledquest@hotmail.com. Thanks!!!)	1999-02-01

This book was the catalyst that made me cut out MY perm out. Very informative and breaks down the tools and ingredients needed for natural haircare and upkeep. I did, like the other readers before me, object to her only using her texturized hair as an example. I have thick, coarse  &quot;Chaka Khan&quot; hair that simply doesn't behave like hers,  &quot;texturizer&quot; and setting lotion or not. If you want more  comprehensive material, check out Pamela Ferrell: she's made that her job  for the last 20 years, so she's more used to different hair types. A great  start though. I hope she updates this with the other sisters in mind!!!	1998-12-26

I purchased &quot;Where Beauty...&quot;, her 1st book, and when I got the funds, I got the next one quick. This book is THE comprehensive guide to how Black women should treat,and cherish their hair. If I ever have a daughter, this book will support my reasons for NOT perming her hair for  &quot;convienience&quot; that costs in the long run. In the South, I run  across plenty of ignorance form sisters who have to have every hair permed  within an inch of its life (to the tune of 1/2 their salaries it seems  like), and then demand to know why I chose differently. I also had the  pleasure of meeting Ms. Ferrell, and she's as wonderful in person as she  comes across in her books. Lead on with light Pam...I hope that more  sisters will embrace themselves because of you!!! This book is priceless!!!	1998-12-26

Taraborelli has written the dishiest book EVER on Miss Thing. Not only does it give you new insight into her success, but into her as a woman. Don't get me wrong: I love Diana, but I knew that there was more going on than what she and Berry let on, and it's ALL in here!!! If you  love her, get it to see why, and if you hate her...same thing!!! This book  is the LICK!!!	1998-12-25

This book blew the roof off of what I thought I knew about my all-time entertainer, Michael Jackson. This book tells you everything you ever thought you needed to know, and then some!!! I felt so close to the real man after reading this book, and although Taraborelli does expose some of  his &quot;warts&quot;, you still feel that he genuinely likes Michael and  isn't out to simply &quot;get paid&quot;. An excellent, excellent book and  essential for every true MJ fan. NOW you know!!!	1998-12-25

If you love language and want to brush up (positively) on your &quot;Ebonics&quot;, then this book is the one to have.

When this reporter goes from finding evidence to a &quot;shotgun&quot; marriage, I couldn't wait to see how it would all wrap up. That trip to the West with the  &quot;mail-order&quot; brides was good too: you could feel the both of them  being drawn together in spite of themselves. And the love  scenes---WOOOOOO!!!!

I picked up &quot;Faith&quot; at a book fair on impulse, and I never leave home w/out it. I'm a full-time wife, mother and employee, as well as a part-time college student, and sometimes I felt as if I couldn't do it all,  but those pages speak to me each time I feel like I can't deal. Her  passages always give you the permission to, no matter what, take care of  yourself. I got 2 more copies for my mother and my sister, and I copy pages  to mail to my equally burdened friends. Thank you Iyanla, for pointing out  and praising our strengths. I'm getting every other book ASAP!!!	1998-11-26

I had seen the book in a couple of stores, and although the covers intrigued me, I never picked one up until I saw my co-worker reading it. I bought it on the way to jury duty and COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!! I was swept  away by the imagery, the story of the slaves and the life they led, and the  realism. The way she incorporated the true events of the day into the  romance was educational too. I loved how Sable was a strong, principled  woman who kept her dignity in adversity, and how Raimond finally lost his  (!!!). They were such a match!!! I was so happy for them, and when they  were ever separated from each other, my stomach sank. The story was just  wonderful, and now I'm digging for her other books. I've never been into  historical romances, but this one sold me!!! You GO Beverly, and let's  visit this couple again!!!	1998-11-26
