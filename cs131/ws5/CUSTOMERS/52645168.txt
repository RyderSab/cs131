While researching learning materials, I found that this book is considered to be a solid overview of the CSQE body of knowledge.<br />Achieving CSQE requires a certain level of experience.  You should be similarly experienced before you read this book.  To understand it, you need to have solid experience as a software quality practitioner and exposure to effective software quality processes.  This book unabashedly favors defect prevention through effective process, process measurement, and continuous process improvement - all widely considered Good Things - with a thick Capability Maturity Model accent.<br />The book's perspective comes from its authors' experience producing large, complex software for very large corporations, frequently on government or military contracts. They've worked on these kinds of projects for 20 years or more. Because of government requirements and the nature of these projects, they've watched the need for process turn into process implementation, expansion, and continuous improvement. As a result, they write as though the audience contains people facing similar situations, seldom creating a bridge to quality practitioners in less stringent environments.  I'm a 13-year veteran of small software companies, most of which had comparatively featherweight software development processes.  Even with my exposure to effective software processes and CMM, I found it difficult to relate to the authors' perspective.<br />Making this book even more challenging to understand is the authors' cumbersome, awkward text. I strongly encourage the authors to consider investing in a rigorous developmental edit to get rid of stilted structure and acres of passive voice, and to help them express their thoughts in a more expository manner.  You'll find yourself reading sentences and even whole paragraphs twice as you try to decode the meaning. I read the whole chapter on Pareto analysis twice, but still didn't understand much of it because the text was so hard to penetrate.<br />Despite these difficulties, I've benefited from this book. It has helped me build my knowledge and has shown me possibilities I'd never considered. I'm sure it will be an important reference book while I take my CSQE exam.  And then I'll be glad to put it on my shelf and let it sit there, because I'm never in the mood for a good text-wrestling match.ysis twice, but still didn't understand much of it because the text was so hard to penetrate.<br />Despite these difficulties, I've benefited from this book.

You may see yourself here.	The author explains how sugars and simple carbohydrates cause fatigue, depression, and a bunch of other undesirable effects in people she calls \\"sugar sensitive.\\" She helps the reader determine whether he or she might be sugar sensitive, and then lays out a plan for adjusting eating habits away from sugars and simple carbohydrates to benefit from better energy and better moods.<br />I'm skeptical of books like this one, even when they explain the \\"science\\" behind their claims, as this one does. But the proof, as this author might say, is in the sugar-free pudding. I met the author's self-diagnostic criteria for sugar sensitivity, and decided to give the plan a try. The author is adamant that you follow her plan exactly, but I have not done that. I'm following all the steps, but in an order that makes more sense to me. As the author predicts, by eating protein at (almost)every meal, cutting out obvious sugars, and favoring brown stuff over white stuff, I feel remarkably better. It's not like I'm suddenly Mr. Cheerful or have a ton of energy, but I'm able to take on the day much better and my mood remains pretty even all the time. I welcome these changes!

The recipes are pretty easy to make and, while they'll never be four-star fare, are adequate for Tuesday night meals for the family.<br />I do have one quibble: Most of the recipes that use ground beef call for only 8 ounces.

Its title is perfect: This really *is* a toolbox, written concisely for beginners.<br />I bought this book when my boss assigned me a market research task that could determine company direction. He gave me the task because of my past work with surveys and usability testing. I wasn't comfortable flying by the seat of my pants on this one -- determining company direction isn't the same as determining what people didn't like about a Help system you created or determining what does and doesn't work well in a computer program's user interface.<br />So I bought this book, and I'm glad I did. McQuarrie minced no words in explaining what market research is and what market research can and can't do for you. He next helped me determine the real goal for my research, and showed me what market-research tools are best suited for achieving that goal. He even told me what tools *not* to use. He did all this in the first 35 pages. The rest of the book describes the tools in the box. I only read the chapters about the tools relevant to my task. Within two hours, I had learned exactly what I needed to know for success -- no more, and no less.<br />I especially appreciate McQuarrie's writing style, which Strunk and White would call \\"vigorous.\\" He packs a lot of information into very few words.<br />Take note: McQuarrie explains that his book will help you determine what tools you should use and tell you the basics of using the tool. However, he cautions that you should hire specialists to actually use the tools, because there is a lot of specialized knowledge behind successfully using each one. If you're determined to use these tools yourself, McQuarrie tells you what other books to read to get started.	2001-09-10

This book helped me tremendously. It began with a simple explanation of how plumbing systems work, and then moved to a discussion of pipe types and tools. Then it got to business explaining how to join pipe and perform typical repair and maintenance tasks. The book does a good job of telling you what to do second if the first attempt to fix a problem doesn't work -- such as what to do when plunging the sink doesn't clear a clog.

Yet this book endures as a compelling and sometimes critical look at important people, times, and events in Indiana's history.<br />Martin tells about Indiana's beginnings: How people came to settle here, what those people were like. He shows how the Civil War played out in Indiana, where every fourth-grade student is now told that \\"brother fought against brother.\\" He describes the poverty of Indiana farm life and how natural gas made many men wealthy, both in the late 1800s. He tells of the \\"golden years\\" in the early 1900s, as cities began to rise. And he explains the troubled years of the 1930s and 1940s, which were fresh in the memories of this book's first audience.<br />Martin's most compelling writing, however, is reserved for his portraits of colorful Indiana men: Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, infamous Klansman D. C. Stephenson, and others. The story of Debs is the best part of the book. Martin clearly sympathized with Debs, who championed the worker from his Terre Haute home and, later, from the Presidentail campaign trail and, finally, from prison. Debs's story is all the more interesting to me because I lived in Terre Haute for several years in the 1990s. My apartment was a mile or so north of Debs's home on Eighth Street, which still stands as a historical site. I can imagine the physical setting of Debs's Terre Haute activism as Martin relates it. But it is difficult for me to imagine the spirit of the city in those days, if nothing else because the city's current sleepiness stands in such stark contrast.	2001-05-11

The book begins by explaining the origin, design, and results of these apparent contradictions. Next, the book cites each set of apparently contradictory verses and summarizes the explanations Biblical scholars give to resolve the apparent contradictions. The summaries are clear and brief, sufficient to satisfy the believer's concerns. The summaries don't seem likely to convince the unsympathetic non-believer, though.<br />Interesting note: It looks like the publisher took the galleys from a very old book called _Discrepancies of the Bible_, slapped a new cover on it, added \\"Alleged\\" to the title, and put it on the market. The book's typography, except for the title and copyright pages, looks like something from 1900. It's telling that no work cited in the bibliography was published later than 1845!

I've been looking for a collection of well-illustrated Bible stories that is complete and accurate, yet written so preschoolers can understand. Although my search has not been exhaustive, this is as close as I've found.<br />This collection of Bible stories is apparently from a translation called \\"The International Children's Bible,\\" an attempt at a Bible that children can read and understand. I give the effort a mixed review. For example, the Ark of the Covenant is translated as \\"God's Holy Box,\\" which is too imprecise for my taste.

They help focus the reader's attention on what the story was supposed to teach. The included memory verses back up each story's message from elsewhere in the Bible.<br />This book is arranged in the same order as the Bible, but that arrangement is not well highlighted.

In an afternoon of reading Walsh's book, and to the probable shock of several of the authors with whom I've worked, I have changed several of mine, such as:<br />- (p. 84) I have ceased to use the en dash to separate numeral ranges. - (p. 128) I have ceased to automatically replace all instances of \\"different than\\" with \\"different from.\\" I now first consider whether the comparison is indirect; if so, \\"than\\" stays.<br />I also learned the error of my ways in a few areas I'm too embarrassed to mention.<br />Walsh's book collects content he used to keep on his Web site. His site continues to feature the book's \\"sharp points,\\" so if you'd like to try before you buy, check out website	2000-11-30

I bought this book on impulse because, for the price, even if it stunk, I wouldn't be out much. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I use this book frequently when I develop Web pages. It's easy to find things in this book and the descriptions are clear. I only wish the book covered cascading style sheets, too.	2000-11-30

Suddenly thrust into a QA management position after a decade in software technical writing, I scrambled to find good information about the task before me. I have some familiarity with the software QA process after this many years in the industry, and was therefore very surprised that this book does *not* cover some topics I had hoped to find, such as smoke testing and negative testing.<br />This book makes some assertions about process that actually vary from company to company. This could confuse those inexperienced in the software industry. For example, the book says that as software nears Alpha test, the \\"documentation plan is probably ready for review.\\" Where I work, the the *documentation itself* better be substantially complete by Alpha test, or there's no hope of the documentation shipping with the product.<br />The chapter on testing documentation misses the mark, as well, focusing heavily on user manuals. Traditional user manuals are decreasingly common as usage information moves online. The book barely discusses online help and overlooks embedded user assistance and electronic performance support tools.<br />Finally, I wish this book had been organized in a more expository manner. Chapters are loosely grouped by general subject. I had hoped to begin reading on page one and let the book teach me about testing. Instead, this book seems to be better suited for use as a reference guide when I need information about a particular subject. Given that I have not found information about some subjects, as I mentioned earlier, my confidence in this book's ability to help me is very low.	2000-09-26

This book clearly encapsulates years of experience -- you can almost feel the pain the authors must have experienced as they learned these lessons the hard way! I have already avoided making a number of mistakes.<br />The authors organized the material effectively and wrote it in a way that promotes skimming and scanning. By reading the first few sentences of a section, you will know whether you are interested in the section. If you're not interested, skip to the next section. The authors even occasionally tell you what sections you can skip should that material not apply to your situation.<br />These skimming and scanning aids are important because the text itself is frequently unexciting and cumbersome. There's not much to do about the former -- nuts and bolts are hard to make exciting. I hope, however, that the authors will consider a good edit for more vigorous writing should they update this book for a second edition.	2000-07-21

Alan Cooper wants nothing short of cultural change in the software industry. He wants to get programmers out of the business of deciding how humans will interact with computers. He asserts that interaction design specialists should do that. Interaction designers will create self-evident software to which customers will flock.<br />Hear, hear -- but good luck. As long as software companies continue to be profitable with programmers doing interaction design, it's not likely to stop.<br />Unfortunately, Cooper limits his book to the business case for interaction design. This omits the action step: how to effect that cultural change within a software company.	2000-06-30

My wife bought this book at a time when I felt like my 3-year-old was taking charge of me. I was skeptical -- all I knew of Dr. Dobson was his interviewing of that serial killer who claimed that pornography played a role in his violence, and I didn't think that link was made clearly enough for Dobson to draw his conclusions. But indeed, Dobson has written a practical, thoughtful, and effective guide. Not only has it helped me regain calm composure and even hand with my young ones, it has given me insight into ways to help build my sons' characters for the long term. Bravo, Dr. Dobson!	2000-06-07

It gives many useful tips and truisms, however, and if you buy it as one element of your larger usability/UI design library, you will be well served. In my work, I'm sometimes called upon to provide usability inspections and design critiques.

I'm reviewing this book when it has fallen out of print, which is probably for the best because my review is biased. You see, I edited this book.  I worked with the author to develop the outline, I developed and copy-edited  every chapter, and I sweated every detail on the galleys.<br />I've edited a  number of computer books in the past six years, but none more satisfying  than this one because *it's darn good.*  Pogue writes extremely well, with  charming humor.  He knows his subject matter frontwards and backwards.  He  truly wants his books to be very well done and to serve readers well.  Believe it or not, these are all rare traits among computer-book  authors.<br />This book is a goldmine for &quot;advanced beginners&quot; and  intermediate Mac users, giving them fast answers to the very usage  questions they ask.  It's not as comprehensive as Pogue's _Mac SECRETS,_  but it still packs in the information.	2000-06-07

As I understand the Bible, demons could reside within people during the first century, but it's not clear to me whether that's still the case today.<br />Regardless, Anderson gives some good practical advice to help you overcome sinful habits. All of that advice boils down to learning and embracing the truth. Whether it's Satan whispering lies into your ears or you lying to yourself, when you recognize those lies, you can (with effort) choose to stop listening to them. When you stop listening to lies and instead listen to truth, your actions will change for the better.	2000-06-07

The author provides a supermarket of information from which you can choose your approach and method for performing usability testing. I had a little usability-testing experience when I bought this book. It quickly gave me some ways to streamline my process, plus some ways to shore up my process where it was weak. The most important thing this book gave me, however, was an understanding of when to use \\"quick and dirty\\" usability testing and when to perform a more thorough study.	2000-06-07

I could write some mean Pascal or FORTRAN. I cut my teeth on BASIC, and taught myself a little C. But then I turned away from programming, and in the ensuing decade, the programming world changed. I bought this book to catch up with the changes. Boy, have things changed -- for example, VB lets you display database records by painting a few controls and typing one line of code. And they call this programming?<br />Halvorson's book guides you through the standard-bearer of programming's current state. Halvorson concisely explains concepts, then walks you through examples that mostly follow this pattern: Create the interface, type in the following code, and run it. To learn from this book, you must pay special attention to the code Halvorson gives you. Read each line and consider the role it plays. If you omit this analysis, you will learn and retain little.<br />When you finish this book, you will have been exposed to the breadth of Visual Basic and will know what kinds of things are available to you. But I have a sneaking suspicion that when you start building your own VB applications, you'll be back at Amazon.com buying a solid VB reference.	2000-02-25

Maguire has written an engaging book, full of practical principles for keeping teams motivated and on task. These principles apply to _any_ product development process, however. I read this book while I managed a team of technical writers. I applied most of Maguire's ideas to the team's process to good success. I think that if I had been managing a team of programmers, however, I would have hoped for more information specific to that discipline.	1999-12-10

This little book explains, at a high level, how to determine customer expectations, build a set of quality attributes that support those expectations, and create metrics that measure compliance with those expectations. Ginac also outlines test methods and development processes, as well as touches on SEI CMM and ISO 9000.<br />Nothing in this book will shake your boots; its principles are classic.

I appreciate its vigorous definitions. The author has done a good job of keeping up with terminology from one edition to the next. I also find its cross-referencing very useful -- within any definition, an italicized word identifies a term that the dictionary also defines.<br />UPDATE 23 Dec 2002: I continue to keep this book on my shelf at work.  Whenever I manage software technical writers and editors, I issue them a copy.  It remains the finest computer dictionary available.	1999-02-11
