We need to get past the idea of the Rapture, which is a made up notion less than 200 years old, and get back to the real meaning of Revelation--God is with us to the end, no matter what trials face us. The \\"enemy\\" will be defeated.<br /><br />I wonder if we would recognize Christ when he does come back. The majority of Jews didn't recognize him the first time; what makes us think the majority of Christians will recognize him the second time? We have all these pre-conceived notions, and I think we will be in for quite a shock when he doesn't come exactly the way we expect him to.	2005-03-21

This lampooning of the home shopping networks industry is hysterical, mean, funny, you name it.

So I guess I am biased. That said, I did get a lot out of this book, and I enjoyed the wide range of authors and their perspectives in this text. This is clearly a more moderate-to-liberal text (which is fine by me), and very Disciples oriented. The index was easy to use and helpful in the writing of my papers during the semester. I liked the suggested readings at the end of the chapters; they were books I might actually read (and I did refer to some of them). This is a book I will use outside the classroom, when it comes time to preach and teach in a ministerial setting.	2005-01-20

But I'm about to go back to school--specifically seminary--and the powers that be recommended we read this book.

Karen, of course, is in a coma for a good part of the novel, but her friends seemed to be sleepwalking through adulthood, with only a few instances of clarity, while she suffered through her coma. And of course, it is a sleeping sickness that takes the lives of everyone but Karen and her friends in the end-of-the-world scenario that leaves our heroes -- you guessed it -- sleepwalking through what is left behind. I enjoyed the novel, but I felt there had to be more to learn from it than what Jared left us with. Not that there isn't much to think about, I just think the ending is a little weak. Still, it's an enjoyable book, and Coupland is in fine form for all but the last 30 pages.	2003-08-13

First, of course, is the obvious juxtaposition between youth and old age, the fleetingness of one and the wisdom (or perceived wisdom) of the other. But what caught my eye was all the hypocricy. (Hypocrisy? Darn the spelling!) For example, David Kepesh, our narrator, bemoans the fact that his beautiful and youthful Consuela has had other lovers, then blythly reveals that even as he is seeing her, he is seeing someone else. (After all, HE can have the freedom the 1960s promises, but what about everyone else?) As for his son, the hypocricy is so glaring, I'll let you read about it for yourself. For a small book, this packs a powerful punch, and I especially like the powerlessness of Kepesh when he is on his knees in front of Consuela, but again, you'll have to read that for yourself.<br /><br />What is not clear, though, is why Consuela holds so much power over him. She may have a perfect body, but Kepesh seems to want something more from his women. Then again, maybe he is that shallow.	2003-08-09

Being a prodigy is not easy for anyone, nor is it easy for a family to have a member--even more than one member--who is ill. What I think is especially tragic is that Hilary too was gifted, and that got lost in both Jackie's pursuit of the cello and in Hilary being placed with the wrong flute teacher. One can only wonder what would have happened if Hilary had pursued her gifts in the way Jackie had.<br /><br />What speaks so well for the book is that, despite all of Jackie's selfish behavior, she still comes across as a sympathetic person, as seen through the eyes of her brother and sister, especially her sister. While they pull no punches, they clearly love their talented sibling. And as we read about her, so do we. Sometimes, they come across like pushovers, especially Hilary, who needed to grow a backbone and tell her sister and husband no to their sexual shenanigans. But love and devotion can lead to strange things. Give the authors credit for being honest, and for researching MS and what it can do to people, without necessarily making excuses for Jackie.	2003-07-24

Nor is this book about anything even approaching a normal family. Art and Lil set about to create a freak show of a family, and they succeed mightily, only they lose control when Arty, the boy with flippers for limbs, takes over in his Machevelian manner. Arty manipulates his audience, and his family, and starts something of a cult that can best be described as bizarre and macabre. What is even more macabre is the devotion he instills in Oly, the narrator and albino dwarf, and in Chick, the seemingly normal boy with mysterious telekinetic powers that he uses in service to Arty's cult. Only one of the Siamese twins seems immune to Arty's control, and she pays for it. Boy, does she pay for it.<br /><br />The story doesn't end with Arty, though, but with Miss Lick, who engages in her own cult of fleshly sacrifice. Only she goes after Oly's daughter, whose disfigurement becomes something of a sexual turn-on, and Oly doesn't want Miranda to lose it. How that gets worked out is a little lame, but suspenseful nonetheless. Overall a good read.	2003-07-21

Interestingly, it wasn't just her size that troubled Cannie, though it was a significant factor in making her who she was. She had abandonment issues with her father, and that played a role in how she dealt with what can only be described as the betrayal by her ex, Bruce. (Who wants the world to know you weigh more than your boyfriend?) Some have commented on the fairy tale qualities of the story, but what I think is important is that the fairy tale things that happen to her didn't save her; she still faced a major crisis that she had to work through, and she didn't always do it well. Yes, a guy came along and &quot;saved&quot; her, but in a way, she saved herself. She realized she was worthwhile, not only to a man, but to herself and to her friends.

He is one of my favorite Christian authors, and it pains me that I will never get to meet him in this lifetime. (That's the main reason I omitted the fifth star!)<br />Anyway, it took me a little bit to get into this book. What was the point of reading the biographies of 13 people to explain Mr. Yancey's conflicting feelings about the church? I could relate to what he went through, though--I only spent a few years in a fundamentalist church, but it was enough to warp me and make me second-guess my faith, even in my strong belief and faithfulness in God and faithful attendance at a liberal church. But I enjoyed the biographies and saw how each helped Mr. Yancey's faith grow, and helped mine, too.<br /><br />I appreciated that he did not stick to white, conservative, fundamentalists. Indeed, he chose people who were black, Asian, liberal, and in one case, not even Christian. (Though Gandhi, in my mind, was probably a better &quot;Christian&quot; than most people who claim the title--and I'll bet he even knew the Bible and Jesus's teachings better. He certainly lived like a Christian, but I digress.) He included the famous and not so famous, but what they all had in common was that they were writers--either by profession or as a sidelight to their main callings. Which is great because we get the chance to read about these 13 men and women for ourselves.	2003-06-24

(I thought I had written a review, but I'll write one again, anyway!)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this honest, moving, yet funny portrayal of Augusten's recovery from alcohol addiction. What I liked was that he didn't pull any punches. He didn't do his recovery perfectly, yet he took it seriously, for the most part. I liked that most of the book was on his recovery, how he tried to stay sober in a world that was still full of users and glorifying using. Most of the book is about what happens after he gets out of treatment, when he has to face the real world. I can relate to that. They say that treatment is about discovery and the 12 steps are about recovery, and Augusten really illustrates that point.<br /><br />This book brings out more honest and heart-felt emotions than in &quot;Running with Scissors,&quot; even underneath the wry sense of humor. I got the feeling by the end of the book Augusten becomes more truly human. I wanted to get to know Augusten by the end of his first memoir; by the end of this one, I wanted to become his friend.	2003-06-23

At first he pooh-poohs the idea he might have a problem, and wants to run away from the run-down rehab center he checks himself into. But along the way, something clicks, and he realizes that yes, he does have a problem, and he has to do something about it. Recovery, though, proves to be more difficult than it's advertised to be, and most of the book is dedicated to Augusten adjusting to trying to maintain sobriety in a hostile world, complete with a friend dying of AIDS, a forbidden lover whose first love is crack, and a jealous co-worker who tries to tip Augusten off the wagon. Sobriety is not for wimps, and Augusten -- and the readers -- learn this lesson the hard way. A must read for all Augusten fans and those who are struggling with any kind of addiction.	2003-06-11

So I picked up this book with much trepidation, wondering what memories and fears it would trigger. Well, it certainly did both. If I needed any more reminders of how dangerous the world of chat is, this book hammered it home. Boy, did it hammer it home. Sometimes, I found his descriptions of the S&M sex Robinson engaged in with his victims a little too graphic for a true crime book. I could have done without it, thank you very much. (I'm getting more sensitive in my old age, I guess.)<br /><br />If anything was missing, I wanted more in the psyche of Robinson. Maybe there wasn't more to be had. But I wanted to know why he did what he did. An alcoholic dad and a strict mom weren't reasons enough--his other siblings came out fine. Perhaps we will never know. What I also didn't like was the author's moralizing and blanket assumption that people like Robinson could not be rehabilitated. I wonder, if Robinson had gotten the psychological help he needed early on, when he was first starting his cons, maybe none of this would have happened. And I mean real, on-going and in-depth psychological help, not just the superficial treatment of the penal system. He is probably too far gone now, at least for anything but divine intervention, but I'll bet he wasn't when he was 25. Despite all that, it was still an interesting and absorbing book.	2003-06-09

I first got these books for my son a couple years ago when I couldn't get him to read anything else. Well, he read these books and really enjoyed them. Now he will read other books, but these are still among his favorite. My daughter is much more interested in reading, but she loves Captain Underpants, too, and thinks it's great fun to read the books out loud to me. And they are pretty funny. Some of the humor is even aimed at adults! The Captain Underpants series even inspired my daughter to write a little book about Captain Cam the Mysterious Man for an assignment that, if I may brag, was much more advanced in terms of plot development and in the creation of a protagonist and an antagonist than what her other first grade peers came up with. True, these books encourage that potty humor that kids of this age seem to find so darned amusing, but they grow out of it. You can always offer other books in addition to these, and in the meantime, Captain Underpants gets them to read. 'Nuff said.	2003-06-07
US	53016908	R5MBQGN4TIUL3	0385507755	641692200	A Million Little Pieces	Books	5	4	11	N	N	Should be read by everyone touched by addiction	James Frey pulls no punches in this harrowing, rage-fueled book about his descent into addiction, and, more importantly, about his recovery. I could relate to his struggles (though my addictions are not the same as his) and his rebellious attitudes toward the treatment &quot;party line.&quot; Though unlike him I ultimately embraced the 12 steps, there were many aspects of my treatment I surely didn't buy, and like him I went kicking and screaming and sometimes just did my own thing. I could relate to The Fury he described, the feelings of self-loathing, the struggles he and his fellow patients went through. I've heard their stories; they are at once the same and yet unique, and I think he captures that well. I think he also captures the joy that can come from recovery. I was amazed at how many times people smiled and laughed in the book. Yet I can remember all the smiles and laughter in my own three months in treatment.<br /><br />As for the question about the 12 steps, here's my take on it. First, I think Mr. Frey doesn't totally understand the concept. He seems to think that people who believe in the 12 steps take no responsibility for their actions. That is not the case. True, we see addictions as diseases, brought on genetically, fueled by childhood traumas. But there is still choice involved, especially once we understand our addictions. I know food is an addiction for me; obviously, I can't stop eating, but I can choose not to have that dessert. The 12-step program gives me tools--people to call, a sponsor, meetings, readings--to help me make the choice not to eat compulsively. That said, the 12 step program is not a perfect program, and it doesn't work for everyone. One of the other things we learn is not to do other people's inventory. Mr. Frey has been sober for 10 years, so who am I to say that what he is doing isn't working? I will say that if someone is reading this book and is facing an addiction problem, don't give up on the 12-step method, but don't believe it is your only option, either.ieve it is your only option, either.	2003-06-06

Scott Peck's that I have read, but it was the most profound. It actually made me cry, as I realized, in reading it, the times in which I have been evil, the times in which my ex-husband has been (and continues to be) evil, and the way in which my dad, despite his many shortcomings, was not truly evil. We are not talking about demon-possessed evil -- though Peck does talk about that in his chapter on demon possession -- but rather about the garden-variety human evil, which I think plagues us all to some degree or another, but some of us are able to rise above our willfulness and narcissism to compassion and the ability to turn our wills over to the God of our understanding.<br /><br />Peck also discusses the anatomy of group evil, and I found something he wrote eerily prophetic. Keeping in mind the book was published in 1983 (20 years ago), read these words: \\"Twenty years from now, when Vietnam has been largely forgotten, how easy it will be, with volunteers, to once again become involved in little foreign adventures. Such adventures will keep our military on its toes, provide it with real-life war games to test its prowess, and need not hurt or involve the average American citizen at all until it's too late\\" (p. 232).

I loved how the lives of the three women wove together; it made perfect sense at the end. This book really explores why we live, whether live is meaningful, and how we find meaning in it. I think this book is destined to become as much of a classic as the Virginia Woolf novel on which it is based.	2003-05-30

I could almost smell the squalor, see the construction and the dirt, feel the heat and the cold, as the architects strove to overcome a lack of time, economic disaster, clashing egos, and death and weather to get the fair off the ground. I also got chills reading about the mysterious Dr. Holmes and the way he preyed upon women who came to Chicago to seek their fortunes and ended up in his lair. Though relatively bloodless by today's standards (he didn't cut up the bodies until after they were dead), he nonetheless was evil personified, the way he used women, tricked them out of money and their honor, promised things he would never deliver, and led them, trusting, to their deaths.<br /><br />The problem I had, though, was, as fascinating as the two stories were, they never really connected for me, except that they both happened in the same time and place. With a little more detail, each could have stood alone as its own book. Still, it was a great read, and I recommend it.	2003-05-26

This is a much tougher proposition than one might think. The mother is a -- ahem -- witch from the old school, meddling and prying. Her husband is a stodgy and stubborn old coot with Parkinson's and rapidly advancing dementia. The kids are a mess. Chip is a sex-obsessed fellow with dillusions that he can write an Important Screenplay. Gary has no control of his family and is constantly monitoring his depression level. His wife complains about how manipulative her mother-in-law is, but she is every bit as bad, or worse! Denise, the daughter, finds success as a chef, but her love life causes untold complications.

Still, it was quite easy to keep up with who was who and who was on which side, something that can sometimes be a problem in a history book. The authors gave a pretty balanced perspective--I do think they were a little more on the Catholic side, but overall, it was balanced. I do wish they had gone more into the background. Why did the British send the Protestants to Catholic Ireland in the first place, and how did the two sides get along before the 20th century? This is glossed over, though I guess what information is given is sufficient. It does whet my appetite to know more, however.	2003-05-13

This book is definitely NOT on par with those by Karen Armstrong and Elaine Pagels. I agree with other reviewers who note that the research is full of holes and the organization is a mess. Worst of all, on several occasions, Bible verses quoted made no sense or were used totally out of context. The book totally lacked credibility for me.<br /><br />I am not a Biblical literalist, but I cannot accept the concept that the ENTIRE life of Jesus was a myth. How can the authors say that Jesus never lived, but Paul did, yet claim that some of Paul's letters were forged? Maybe ALL of Paul's letters were forged. This stretched credibility too far for my beliefs. There are better books on Gnosticism out there. Skip this one.	2003-05-12

For example: Kate makes more than Richard, and they pay the nanny more than what Richard makes. Why not just have Richard stay home with the kids? But noooooo. Men are too muddle-headed to manage the lives of children, so that option is never even considered! But Kate does have a point about part-time work, as I am discovering: you get sucked in to more and more work (or you get hopelessly placed on the mommy track). Anyway, despite my frustrations with the lack of options--or maybe because of them--I was drawn into the book. I enjoyed the humor and the pathos, and I recommend this for all working mothers and those who have to work and live with them.	2003-05-03

I read this book with a sense of horror and amazement--horror that someone's life could be that terrible and topsey-turvey, and amazement that he could not only survive it, but come away so articulate and matter-of-fact about it all. I felt a lot of guilt, too, because I could relate to the craziness of his mother, and I fear, could I be marking my children the way Augusten's mother marked him? Still, there is hope admist all the chaos and clutter, in that the author comes away seeming somewhat normal. The ending is a little bit abrupt, but then, life does sometimes come out that way, and this book is about real life, however warped it may be. Read this book, but only with a strong stomach.	2003-04-27

I had a hard time getting into this book, what with the streams of consciousness, the sudden changes in points of view and scenes, and what have you. But once I finally got into it -- I had to have NO distractions to read this book -- I found it interesting and poignant. I found the characters fascinating, even in their shallowness, or perhaps because of their shallowness. I was particularly struck by Richard Dalloway's resolve to tell his wife that he loved her, then his failure to do so, but they both understood the feelings were there. It seemed this was a scene played out over and over again, a sad but true fact of their domestic life together. Miss Kilman was also a pitiable but interesting character. I do wish the daughter, Elizabeth, could have been fleshed out more, and the connection between Mrs. Dalloway and Septimus made stronger. Still, it was quite a good book, so long as I was able to give my full concentration to it. I am glad, though, books aren't written this way today, though!	2003-04-26

He explains the world in which the Bible was written, shows the metaphors of both the Hebrew Bible and what was repeated in the Christian New Testament. To me, this is a much more satisfying and holy was of reading the Bible than a fundamentalist one, even if it is more challenging. I highly recommend it for people who, as the subtitle suggests, want to take their Bible seriously, but not literally.	2003-04-22

Still, the characters drew me in, as their grief and anger took center stage, even as they tried to get on with their lives. Susie's father, in particular, seemed real and torn by his grief. Some have criticized the way her mother responds to the loss, but to me she sounds believable in the way she runs away from her grief. Perhaps it's because I can see such tendencies in myself. The scene with Ray and Susie/Ruth at the end was a little contrived, though it was really sweet and it would be nice to have something like that happen in real life. Ruth was a character who was a puzzle. Her motivations were never truly clear. But still, I loved the book and would read it again.	2003-04-18

Admittedly, Whitaker has his bias, but his description of how the mentally ill, especially those with schitzophrenia, is frightening, and altogether too true. What is really scary, though, is how much of the abuse -- tainted drug trials, experiementing on those who have not given informed consent -- has gone on just in the last two decades. And the side effects of these medications are not to be taken lightly. My ex-mother-in-law has schitzophrenia and bi-polar, and the meds she took, while they seemed to keep her sane but somewhat weird, caused the dreaded side effects Whitaker describes--tardive diskonisia, flat affect, weird mouth movements, and so on. Ironically, she is now off all medications and doing no worse than she was on the medication. I take one of the \\"atypicals,\\" and while I haven't had serious side effects with it, I wonder if I really need this medication. This book certainly gives me plenty to talk over with my doctor, and anyone who has a mental illness or a loved one who does should read this book and talk it over with their doctor, too.<br /><br />My one gripe--very little was said about bi-polar disorder and nothing about depression.	2003-04-16

She presents stories of loss and betrayal from the Bible to remind us we are not alone in our hurts, then talks about Scriptures that point to God's love and care for us. Those are the words that keep coming up for me: Love and care. This book is great for anyone suffering a broken heart, especially when a relationship has broken up. It reminds us that we are always loved by God, we are always his children and his bride, and nothing can take that away from us. My only regret was that I didn't find this book sooner!	2003-04-13

I always love works by John Irving, though I haven't read him in several years. &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; reminded me of why I like him: quirky characters, improbable situations, unique love stories. This book has it all, and compacted in a much shorter story than his usual work. Patrick was believable as a journalist who eventually develops a conscience (I have met a few of those), and Mrs. Clausen was a sympathetic character without being overwrought. This book has a lot to say about both medical and journalistic ethics, and he works in real life situations nicely. I highly recommend this book.	2003-04-13

The book includes exercises and assignments to help parents practice their new skills, and cartoons of various situations the new skills might be put into practice, serving as a handy, quick guide for on-the-spot reference checking.

Lewis used to describe his points about the divinity of Christ, the relationship between Father and Son, of God to man, and people to each other. Pithy but not witty, this book includes several quotes that will forever be a part of my reperatoire: \\"Really great moral teachers never do introduce new moarlities: it is quacks and cranks who do that\\" (p. 82); \\"A moderately bad man knows he is not very good: a thoroughly bad man thinks he is all right\\" (p. 93); and \\"The sense in which a Christian leaves it to God is that he puts all his trust in Christ: trusts that Christ will somehow share with him the perfect human obedience which he carried out from His birth to His crucifixion: that Christ will make the man more like Himself, and in a sense, make good his deficiencies\\" (p. 147). This will definitely be a staple on my religious book shelf. I'm glad my friend bought it for me for Christmas, and I am sorry it took me this long to get around to it!	2003-04-10

We have a dying man, who slighted Tom Ripley, and is now fingered by Ripley and a friend to go kill some Mafia figures. Money that might not be tempting in ordinary circumstances becomes reason enough at the prospect of dying and leaving his family destitute. What I liked was that Jonathan didn't jump up to do the murder, nor have a sudden change of heart. He was sort of swept up in the whole thing. And what is interesting is that Tom comes as close to forgiving as a psychopath is capable--he did come to Jonathan's rescue more than once. A complex game, indeed, with an ending that will keep you guessing right to the end. It does leave me wondering, though, how does Tom keep getting away with murder?	2003-04-08

There were some details that didn't need to be there, or at least not as drawn out as they were. Still, though, this is a good book in terms of looking at how writing and our imaginations affect our real lives. McEwan's description of how young Briony totally misunderstands the adult world around her is masterful, and makes her somewhat sympathetic, despite the terrible thing she has done. The ending is also something of a surprise, which makes the book worth sticking out to the end. I'd really give this 3-1/2 stars if I could, but I can't, so three stars it is. Still worth your time, though.	2003-04-06

How about nearly every romance book on the planet! The writing style was too obvious, the way information was conveyed.

Instead, editor Michael O'Laughlin gives us selected writings of Nouwen's that illustrate the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and how we can apply them to our daily lives. Nouwen's messages of love, self-sacrifice and servant-leadership come alive in these selections. Definitely worth it.<br /><br />I do have to wonder, though, how many compilations of Nouwen's work can be put out before the effect is diluted. Those who are in charge of his estate may need to think about easing back on re-releasing his work, and let what he has stand on its own. Otherwise, it can get rather repetitious, as some of what was in this book I have read in other books already.	2003-04-01

This is an insightful, balanced look at the history of LSD, from its roots as chemical warfare for the CIA (and to think we're at war with Iraq in part because of their chemical weapons) to the psychedelic 1960s and beyond. We meet such fascinating people as Timothy Leary, Allen Gingsburg, and Ronald Stark, and see how the government and people with greed on their minds ruined what might have been an eye-opening drug. (Not that I recommend people take LSD--I do write for a substance abuse prevention program!) The book also raises questions about our drug policy--aat least up through the 1980s and how it affected people's use and interest in LSD, not to mention the kind of trips they took. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know more about drug history, government conspiracies, and history of the 1960s in general.	2003-03-31

Although the events are made up, I found myself really believing the story Chevalier spins about the model of the painting, her being forced to work for the Veneer family, the turmoils she endures in that home and her own, the conflicting emotions she has for the painter and for Pieter, the butcher's son. The setting is real, the descriptions clear but not too cluttering, and the characters' motivations clear. Heaven knows I wanted to slap Cornelia several times in the book! I highly recommend this book, especially for book clubs. Much can be discussed about this work, not the least of which are the symbolism of the earrings and the ways in which men in the book treat women.	2003-03-26

I really enjoyed this look at sexual addiction and codependency in women, and how the two are intertwined. Indeed, I enjoyed the entire holistic approach to these twin problems. Much of what Dr. Kasl said really hit home, and I found I gained a lot of insight into my own problems. I also liked that this book treated sexuality as a friend, and something to be treasured. It's too easy for people in recovery from sexual addiction and codependency to ignore their sexual side altogether, and that is a dangerous place to be. This book should be required reading in sexual addiction 12-step groups, for both men and women.	2003-03-25

There was actually a plot? The whole mystery of who is trying to kill Antonietta and her family is lost in the whole courtship between her and Byron. Don't get me wrong, the erotic scenes were certainly erotic--though they did get repetitive; how many times was I to read \\"the swell of her breast\\"? The Carpathian world was intriguing, as well, and there was enough information for me, as a first-time reader of the series, to catch on to the nuances of this breed. And I liked that the heroine was blind and overweight. Curves are good! But the plot was weak, and seemed to serve as bridges between the erotic parts, when it should be the other way around. Oh well. It was a good beach read, which is what I used it for!	2003-03-22

This book gives readers a chance to delve into the &quot;other side&quot; of Christianity--the gnostic view that was almost lost to the mists of history. Thankfully, someone found the gnostic writings, so we have an idea of what their view was from the people themselves. The gnostics had different views on the resurrection, church hierarchy, the role of women, and how one comes to know God. Some of their ideas show up today--many ultra-liberal Christians take the resurrection as more of a symbolic event, and more and more churches are including women in their leadership roles. We are probably more gnostic than we realize. I don't agree with everything the gnostics held, but their ideas should be considered by every thinking Christian. I hope to read more about the gnostic Gospels.	2003-03-06

This book was highly readable, not too complex but didn't talk down to the reader, and includes exercises to help the cybersex addict get started on his/her recovery. If it has a flaw, it is that the authors' definition of sobriety is a little murky. Still, this is a very helpful book, with plenty of examples from real-life addicts.

Suffice it to say it was believable enough for someone who didn't know better--except for having to wait in the bar for the posting of the scores. In the electronic age, that was a howler. That and serial numbers on golf clubs. Wouldn't it have made more sense for golfers to simply have their initials engraved on the shaft or something?<br /><br />Overall, the book was readable, the plot moved along well, and Conner Cross was a hero/anti-hero worth cheering for. I like reading about a guy who tweaks his nose at the stuffy establishment, especially when he sees the hypocrisy. However, when the killer was revealed, I was disappointed. Like other reviewers suggested, it seemed drawn out of thin air. I should be able to look back at a book, find a clue and say, &quot;Ah-ha, I missed that,&quot; or &quot;Oh, yes, I saw that.&quot; Not this time. It was still an enjoyable read, but you are probably better off checking this one out from the library, or at most buying the paperback version.	2003-02-17

Her chapters on &quot;the other woman&quot; and &quot;when he remarries&quot; were especially helpful, as were chapters on how to deal with going back to work and taking on new responsibilities at home, and on dealing with the divorce in church. (One thing she didn't cover--what to do when your ex-spouse and his wife continue to go to the same church! In my case, I insisted he find a different Sunday School class, I stay away from them as much as possible, and get involved in different activities. Fortunately, I go to a big church.)<br /><br />If there was one flaw, it was that most of the book assumed the divorce was the husband's fault, as it seemed to largely be in her case. The truth is, even when a husband leaves for another woman, it takes two to destroy a marriage, and she only gave lip service to that and to the self-forgiving necessary as part of the healing process. In my case, I had as much to do with the breakup of the marriage as my ex did, so some things hit rather hard; I was almost where her ex-husband was, though thankfully I repented.<br /><br />The best things I will take from this book are the &quot;feel, deal, heal&quot; formula for coping with all the emotions that come from a divorce, and the reminder to be content in God with whatever my marital state is. And yes, there are blessings to being single!	2003-02-17

I generally agree with her premise--that women have been taught not to show their anger, to stuff their feelings, to accept the &quot;glass ceiling,&quot; and all these stuffed emotions can lead to depression. But I think she fails to see the chemical component of depression. Why do some women deal with these issues and not get depressed, and some do? Still, medication alone doesn't &quot;cure&quot; depression, any more than therapy alone, and certainly giving women permission to express their anger will help them deal with their depression. After all, what is depression but anger turned inward?	2003-02-14

The Max Sand/Nevada Smith story line, at least, was different, but westerns aren't my genre.

Some of the people, he talked to, admittedly, were kind of whiny, like the woman who dropped out of medical school because she discovered she would have to--gasp!--work with sick people. On the other hand, I found many of the stories inspiring and helpful, and they guided me back toward two of the career goals I had wanted to pursue in the first place--writing and the ministry. Now I'm taking more decisive steps in both those directions. Po worries in his book that he might be interfering in some of his interviewees' lives, but isn't that the whole point of the book? This isn't objective journalism, and he shouldn't try to make it such. I think he did a fine job, and he certainly helped me. Thanks, Po.	2003-02-07

At least he helps us find meaning in our suffering, which is definitely a step in the right direction. He also explains the value of physical pain--he probably could have extended the analogy to psychological pain; if we didn't feel psychological pain, we would just go about doing whatever we felt like to other people without thought of the consequences.<br /><br />I also appreciated the detail Mr. Yancy went into to discuss how people can approach those in pain, realizing there is no one right way, but there are certainly wrong ways! God does not send us pain because we are &quot;bad,&quot; or to send judgement on us! I would definitely recommend this book for someone in pain, particularly physical pain, such as cancer or a chronic illness, as well as to their loved ones.	2003-02-07

But I stuck it out, and I'm glad I did. Fowler is clever in giving a mock symposium to introduce the development theories of Erickson, Piaget, and Kohlberg. And once he actually gets into his stages of faith development, the book really gets interesting. He provides interesting examples of people at different stages of faith development, and importantly, he does not judge people at the different stages--it would be easy to assume people are &quot;better,&quot; or &quot;more faithful&quot; at higher stages. This book helped me understand where I am in my faith development, and helped me see ways I can grow in my own faith. This is not, however, a casual read. It takes quite a bit of concentration, and at times, I found Fowler a little hard to follow, especially at the beginning and the end. Still, I recommend it for anyone who wants to understand their faith journey, whatever faith journey they may be on.	2003-01-28

He had many good quotes along the way that led me to some good introspection -- not mere bumper sticker theology.

It is interesting too, and believable, how history repeats itself in each generation. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the ending silly, though perhaps it was a tad bit contrived. Like other readers, I did guess the identity and motive of the person behind the persecution of Jane fairly early on (though I did get thrown a curve ball about 2/3 of the way through), but that did not detract me from reading the story, as there were so many other secrets to be revealed, some of which were total surprises. This is a great novel for cold winter evenings by the fire with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea.	2003-01-15

(I have several of his children's books, and my children and I have thoroughly enjoyed them.) Overall, I found the little essays in this book well-written and inspirational. I would tell myself I would just read \\"one or two\\" as a nightly devotional, and end up reading five or six! His descriptions of God's grace and love for us are beyond compare. I did, however, find his descriptions of Christ's death on the cross almost too gleefully lurid. I appreciate the need to explain just how much Christ sacrificed for us, but I wonder if perhaps Mr. Lucado goes into too much detail? I definitely would not recommend this book for someone under 16 for that reason. Still, this is a great, inspirational book and a great introduction to Lucado's work.	2003-01-13

I really enjoyed the format of having the book entirely written through emails, and unlike some other reviewers, I found I got to know the characters quite well by how they wrote and responded to their emails. The interplay between Mel and John, between Mel and her co-workers, and the various family members, all were priceless! They were all larger than life, without being over-the-top. Nadine was the perfect best friend, and I loved that she was a size 16! All the pieces and subplots fit well together, and even when I could see how certain things would end up, I still enjoyed watching the pieces come together. This was a light, fun read, and very, very enjoyable. I caan't wait to see what else Meggin Cabot comes up with next!	2003-01-10

Spencer coherently points out the many ways in which the Koran is used to justify ill treatment of women and of those who are not Muslim. He also explains how Muslims took over Christian lands 400 years before the Crusades -- which, of course does not justify the Crusades, but does put the Crusades in a new context.<br /><br />That said, I had to question why he thinks only MUSLIM fundamentalists are dangerous. He holds up Christianity as a pillar of light in the founding of Western secularism (making me wonder if Spencer is perhaps European). The problem is not in the Muslim faith itself, but in the literal reading so many Muslims give it. The same is true in Christianity--why is he so quick to gloss over the fact that for so many years, Southern Christians used the Bible to condone and endorse slavery? What about the fundamentalist churches, and the Catholics, that use a literal reading of the Bible to keep women who have God-given talents to preach and teach from doing so, and in some cases keep them subservient in their homes? What about the laws, inspired by a literal, non-contextual reading, of the Bible, that actively discriminates against 10 percent of our population, that is gays and lesbians? Certainly things are much better here than in Muslim countries, but we suffer here, too, from the abuses of fundamentalism. And unlike Spencer, I believe that as more Muslims are exposed to Western thought, they will begin to read the Koran in a more liberal, contextual light, as many Christians and Jews have learned to read their scriptures.<br /><br />In short, I think the threat Spencer spells out is real, but while it is strongest from Muslim fundamentalists, it is not only from the Muslim fundamentalists. I recommend reading \\"The Battle for God\\" for a further discussion of fundamentalism in all three monotheistic faiths (though that doesn't really get into the threats of fundamentalism in general, either).r a further discussion of fundamentalism in all three monotheistic faiths (though that doesn't really get into the threats of fundamentalism in general, either).	2003-01-02

Fundamentalist Christians are guilty of the former; fundamentalist Jews and Muslums are guilty of the latter. But Armstrong doesn't point fingers at these fundamentalists and say, &quot;Bad, bad people!&quot; Rather, she looks at the struggles each of the societies she writes about undergoes to modernize, and how each religion adapted, in some people, by turning to fundamentalism. She astutely points out the secularists don't have all the answers, either; all logos and no mythos makes Jack and Jill disillusioned children. Which, of course, leaves them open to fundamentalism, rather than a more balanced approach that leaves reason to reason and mystery to mystery.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well-researched and well-balanced book. I especially enjoyed the history of Iran leading up to the Iran hostage crisis (which itself gets little ink, as though it were anti-climatic; apparently it turned out to be a much greater venture than the students who took the hostages bargained for!). Some fundamentalists, especially fundamentalist Christians might not like the way they get portrayed; the televangelist scandals of the late 1980s are told a little tongue in cheek. But reading this might help people understand where fundamentalists -- and liberals -- are coming from, and perhaps find ways to bridge the gaps.	2002-12-29

I remember the fear that was passed on to me about that section of Tulsa and the dread of facing students from its high school whenever we played them in football, a darker fear than seemed warranted for a city of its size. Now, knowing the history of the race riots and the fears both sides had of sparking another one, I understand why.<br /><br />Hirsch does an amazing job of piecing together from both \\"official\\" and oral history the story of the riot, as well as what led up to it, and the racial climate surrounding the event. While he clearly favors the \\"black\\" side of the story, he doesn't give in to the most extreme views, and he does give the \\"white\\" views time and space. He also points out the difficult questions of reparations, and why there are no easy answers. Most importantly, \\"Riot and Remembrance\\" shows the readers why history can never be neatly tied up and packaged. We will probably never know the details of what happened on the ugly night and day of May 31-June 1, 1921, in Tulsa. We'll never know for sure the death toll, or what exactly was in the hearts of the African-Americans, the \\"ruffian\\" white, or the city leaders who coveted the Greenwood land. But at least with Hirsch's book, we have a chance to ponder all sides and draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />And, by the way, this is one Oklahoman who thinks the state and city SHOULD pay reparations in the form of scholarships and economic development in North Tulsa. I suspect I am in the minority, though!	2002-12-29

Ms. Rinehart tells us in a simple, but not simplistic, style, how God can restore passion in the lives of women, through daring to love, to desire through God, through forgiveness, through letting go of too much control. Indeed, I wondered if she had experience with 12-step groups; I recognized a lot of her wisdom in 12-step work I have been doing lately. Perhaps her sentence in the final paragraph says it best: \\"If God has you in the palm of his hand and your real life is secure in him, then you can venture forth -- into the places and relationships, the challenges, the very heart of the storm -- and you will be safe there\\" (p 182). If I have one complaint, it is that she seems to assume her readers are married women, particularly in her chapter on sexuality, in which she reserves only a paragraph or two on the sensuality of non-married women. But I still found it helpful, and it's a book I will continue to refer to even though I have finished reading it.	2002-12-27

Quinn is an interesting, though rather naive character, and his haunting by Goblin is by turns spooky and sweetly sad. The twist to the haunting I did not see coming, and I was duly surprised, showing me that after all these years, Rice still has what it takes to keep an audience spellbound.<br /><br />That said, this book still suffered from want of some editing. Some of the dialog was stilted at best, and at times downright mawkish. Also, I could see many places that Rice's writing could have been tightened. For example, she opens chapter 42 by writing, &quot;When we returned to the palazzo, which we did by ordinary means, that is, walking, . . . &quot; Why not write, &quot;When we walked back to the palazzo, . . . &quot;? I fear that editors are afraid to edit someone as famous and great as Anne Rice, forgetting that even she needs an editor. That's why they are there! Still, this book is a great read, and definitely an improvement over her last few releases.	2002-12-24

The result is fascinating, and gives readers a fresh perspective on the God of the Old Testament. Here, we see a God who is ever-changing, not always quite sure of himself, reactive at times rather than proactive, and by the end of the literary narrative is silent. In some ways, God is brought down to human terms, but in other ways, God becomes more complex. He is knowable, yet unknowable, the unmysterious mystery.<br /><br />It is helpful for readers to have an understanding of the Tanakh, as the order of the books are different from that of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible. It is also helpful to realize that this is a LITERARY look at the Hebrew Bible, and the stories are not necessarily told in chronological order. Ruth, for example, comes much later than the story of David. Still, I found it helpful for my faith to see God as a literary character, and I thank Miles for doing an outstanding job at providing an interesting and fresh critique.	2002-12-16

Most importantly, I think, is the question of, if there is a God, who created him? But I believe that humans, being above animals, have a God-hunger, and all of us have a Higher Power of some kind that we believe in, and Smith, whether he realizes it or not, is no exception. His &quot;God&quot; is reason. If he cannot make it fit into reason, then he does not believe in it. That is fine for him, and more power to him. But the reality is, he is no more of an atheist than I am, as a Christian.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in the book was that it focused too much on refuting the Christian God over refuting other gods. It seemed to me that Smith had an ax to grind. Maybe he has a point. Too many atrocities have been committed in the name of the Christian God, but is it the fault of God, or those who have chosen to warp God's message? Finally, his final chapters on ethics is disturbing. It seems that his &quot;reasonable&quot; take on ethics is that we should do what ought to make us happy, as opposed to what we are guilted into by Christian ethics. But Christian ethics are about everyone putting the welfare of others first; if we all did that, then we all would be truly joyous, which is deeper than a mere superficial happiness, and we would live in peace. As usual, I am being somewhat utopian, but I believe that if we believed in God's kingdom here on earth, we could achieve that state.	2002-12-05

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Another excellent book by Nouwen	Nouwen gives us another excellent look at the spritual life, and how we can live it to the fullest, this time by using the metaphor, of holding, lifting, and drinking the cup, as Christ did in his life, death, and resurrection. We see that in order to truly drink our cups, we must be willing to drink both joy and sorrow, to in effect, drink life to its fullest, \\"to the dregs,\\" if you will. Nouwen ably uses examples of hospitality and from his life with the mentally disabled at L'arche Daybreak to make his points. Especially poignant is the story of a visit he makes to one resident who has to spend time in a mental institution, and how that resident breaks down barriers to bring joy and hospitality to some rather stuffy people.<br /><br />What was so wonderful about Henri Nouwen was that God was everywhere for him, in the simple as well as the most complex. His message of hope and love resonnates not only with his core Catholic constituents, but with Protestants like me, and I suspect, with people of other faiths as well. I have yet to read a book of his that hasn't moved me and helped me grow in my faith. This one is no exception. Definitely a keeper and one to be reread!	2002-11-24

It was balanced, in that while the heroes were clearly the Muslims and the \\"bad buys\\" were the European invaders, Maalouf let us see the foibles of the Muslim rulers, the power struggles and the back stabbing (sometimes literally) between the various sultans and emirs who were trying to gain their own advantages while working to expell the Frankish invaders (or sometimes working WITH the Crusaders). At the end of the book, Maalouf also gives a brief account of the advantages of the West and the failings of the Muslims, even though the Muslims did ultimately succeed in getting the Crusaders off their land. Some may argue that the book is biased against the West, but then again, who were the invaders, anyway? I think, given the fact that it's told from a Muslim perspective, it's fairly balanced. I'd like to see a fundamentalist Christian be so fair! My only complaint is that I would have liked to have seen more of an explanation of why the Crusaders were there in the first place, but perhaps that is for another historian to tell. Overall, I recommend this book for any student of medieval history or religion, especially those who want more than a Eurocentric view.	2002-11-22

Karen Armstrong gives the readers a comprehensive view of the evolution of the three monotheistic faiths. In many respects, this is an eye-opening history, and will probably make many fundamentalists of all three faiths weep and gnash their teeth, and with good reason. We need to see that God is as much an evolving idea as He is a Being (or, perhaps, \\"Non-being\\") that creates and sustains us. Armstrong deftly shows us how the early Hebrews developed their concept of Yahweh from the early pagan war and fertility cults, how the concept of Jesus as savior and sacrifice for our sins developed, how the issue of the Trinity was addressed, and how Islam came to be.<br /><br />What was distressing, though, is that while Armstrong correctly, in my opinion, points out the dangers of a literal God, goes too far in condemning an anthropomorphic God. I found myself depressed by the end of the book, questioning the conclusion, it seemed, that God did not exist, or if he did, he wasn't there as a Being. Reading this book certainly shook my faith, and I recommend reading this book with care, especially as one gets into the later chapters that focus on the development of atheism. Readers who are in a state of spiritual upheaval could find this book extremely challenging, though I believe that faith grows from our doubts.	2002-11-19

I also felt sorry for poor Grayer, the child who was all but abandoned by his parents. All he ever wanted were his parents, but they were so busy with their petty adult lives, they couldn't have cared less. The mild revenge Nanny gets at the end, though, isn't enough. I know the Xes won't get the message, and Grayer will just have to get whatever love he can from yet another nanny, who will no doubt be taken advantage of until she dares to speak up..<br /><br />The writing style is a little spare; I could have used more description and a sense of feeling.

Bruce Feiler challenges his readers to understand how the three monotheistic faiths that grew out of the revelations of Abraham developed their beliefs and used Abraham's story to further their own causes. I found it especially interesting to see how each religion tweaked Abraham's story, and in some cases changed it wholesale. Yet I don't think (and I think Feiler doesn't think) that diminishes the power of what Abraham brought to the table. Abraham gave to the world the idea of a loving, portable, all-powerful God that roughly half the world celebrates in some form or fashion. Now if only we could all come together and find peace through this one God that Abraham, in essence, discovered for us!	2002-10-17

I read this book because I was asked to review it by the author, and I obliged, not knowing that what I was getting was going to be something way different from my beliefs. So understand that, unlike the previous reviewers, I read this with a bit of skepticism. Perhaps, though, that is not a bad thing. Who knows?<br /><br />With that caveat in mind, I found the book interesting and full of nice little stories of people's spiritual, and sometimes miraculous, encounters with feathers. Interspersed are meditations and rituals the readers can try at home to bring the energy of feathers into their own lives. The book would certainly be a blessing for someone who is already sold on the idea that feathers have an energy and aura to bring to people's lives. What it did not do, however, was convince a skeptic like me that feathers are necessarily anything special, except perhaps in a symbolic way. This book is a great read for the converted, and it may convert some people to the magic of feathers, but, alas, it didn't do it for me. Still a good read, though.	2002-05-30

Lewis writes the ultimate Christian primer -- telling his readers how best to be faithful Christians by showing us how we should NOT behave! Screwtape, a high level denomic bureaucrat, is advising his neophyte demon nephew Wormwood on how to win over to &quot;Our Father Below&quot; his &quot;patient,&quot; a new Christian who must be wooed away from &quot;the Enemy,&quot; who is, of course, God. What makes this book so profound is that the temptations Screwtape suggests to Wormwood are not just the obvious ones, but the subtle ones that get to us everyday, sometimes under the guise of &quot;doing good.&quot; How many of us, for example, have gotten into arguments with a loved one over who was being more unselfish -- &quot;I don't want pepperoni on the pizza, but go ahead, have pepperoni, I don't mind.&quot; &quot;No, I insist. No pepperoni, even though I love it so much, because I know you hate it.&quot; &quot;No, please, have the pepperoni, darn it!&quot; And so the resentment builds. It is this sort of sin and temptation that Screwtape urges Wormwood to play upon his hapless &quot;patient.&quot;<br /><br />But Screwtape knows his &quot;enemy&quot; and he knows his limits. My favorite line, and one well worth hanging on to for all of us who feel we have lost hope: &quot;Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys&quot; (p. 40). And never forget. The demons never deny the existence of either Father or Son.	2002-05-22

I wasn't sure whether to give this one two or three stars, and I reluctantly ended up giving it two stars. This book was just too hard to follow. Basically, it follows the tale of Maggie Dolan, a woman fresh out of a sanitorium, who is being kept just a bit off balance on medication, but who, after putting her cat in the refrigerator, decides to go off them, only to discover that she is being watched. It is never completely clear why she is being watched, except that it has something to do with her brother and and her husband and a drug raid that went south. How do Jenny and Sandy, the girl in the wheelchair and her mother fit in? Sandy's husband, a writer Maggie meets at a writer's conference before the accident that puts her in the sanitorium, also has a role in this, but it is also not clear how he fits in. Just too many loose ends. And why do people around her get killed? To keep them silent or is it just a coincidence? That is never explained. Too bad, this story has promise, and is well told, but it has too many loose ends and leaves the reader wanting more information.	2002-05-18

Benjamin January is in quite an unenviable position. He is a free man of color, but his status is very precarious in a society that at one time respected the rights of people like him, but as more American whites have come in, his freedom could be taken away at any moment. And with the murder of a free woman of color ruffling the feathers of both the white and colored community, Benjamin's very life could be in danger.<br />Ms. Hambly not only makes the mystery engrossing, she also makes the caste system engrossing. We come to understand the ins and outs of the New Orleans society Benjamin and his family and friends reside. We also understand why Benjamin both reviles it and yet cannot leave it. For better or worse, this is home. And Ms. Hambly describes it in lush detail, from the wild costumes of the colored balls to the Louisiana backwoods and swamps. You can almost feel the drumbeats the slaves are forbidden to tap out, yet do so with their voices and the rhythm of their work. I will definitely be reading more of this series.	2002-05-16

What we have here is a standard contemporary romance novel, and admittedly a fairly well-done one for the genre, with an added twist -- UFOs and alien abductions to move the plot along. The plot twist was reasonably interesting, though it didn't fire my imagination sufficiently to start reading all kinds of UFO books to decide for myself whether such phenomenon exists or not. Beyond the paranormal science fiction element, the novel seems to follow the standard romance novel formula -- man meets woman, sparks fly, they are both attracted to each other but find themselves rubbing against each other like sandpaper. He saves her from herself a couple of times. They almost get together a couple of times, they make love, then a misunderstanding keeps them apart almost to the end . . . you get the picture.<br /><br />The writing was well done for the most part, but I was perturbed by Blais George's shifting of point of view in mid-scene in a couple of places. That was rather disconcerting. Still, for those who like a basic romance novel and don't mind an unusal plot element, it's a nice read.<br /><br />(A word on the format. I read a CD version of the book. I liked the large print and general readability of the Abode PDF format. Though it made me realize I will need a more comfortable office chair! :-) This is my first book on CD, and I have several more waiting in the wings. Hard to say if reading books on computer will catch on. It probably is a good way for books like this one to get out there, and may be cheaper than publishing books by print method. Stay tuned.)	2002-05-15

But what stood out most to me was the way the women -- Pamela, Gretchen, Mary Sue, and even Dixie to some extent -- spent the first two thirds of the novel thinking they needed a man, any man, in their lives to make them complete, never realizing that what made them complete human beings was the strength they had in themselves. This was the lesson they each had to learn in their own way and on their own -- and Mary Sue, perhaps because of her struggle with breast cancer, never learns. Indeed, their views of marriage were so old fashioned, at times I found it hard to believe these were daughters of the 1970s and adult women of the new millenium, even if they did come from a wealthy Kansas City suburb. But perhaps -- and here I speak as a newly divorced woman myself -- that is a sign that maybe we women have not come as far as we think we have.<br /><br />As for the secret of Walter's death, it gives tension to the plot, but it is almost extraneous to the story. I wonder if the story could have been told without him. In any case, the women who covered his death were right. He is a jerk!	2002-05-14

Benjamin January is in quite an unenviable position. He is a free man of color, but his status is very precarious in a society that at one time respected the rights of people like him, but as more American whites have come in, his freedom could be taken away at any moment. And with the murder of a free woman of color ruffling the feathers of both the white and colored community, Benjamin's very life could be in danger.<br /><br />Ms. Hambly not only makes the mystery engrossing, she also makes the caste system engrossing. We come to understand the ins and outs of the New Orleans society Benjamin and his family and friends reside. We also understand why Benjamin both reviles it and yet cannot leave it. For better or worse, this is home. And Ms. Hambly describes it in lush detail, from the wild costumes of the colored balls to the Louisiana backwoods and swamps. You can almost feel the drumbeats the slaves are forbidden to tap out, yet do so with their voices and the rhythm of their work. I will definitely be reading more of this series.	2002-05-02

Yet in doing so, Ruth McBride Jordan, nee Rachel Shilsky crossed what was once, and for some still is, an uncrossable barrier: she married not one, but two, black men, converting to Christianity along the way. She lost her Jewish family and isolated herself from both whites and, to a lesser extent, blacks, but raised 12 children who all became college-educated professionals.<br /><br />This is not a portrait of a saint, either mother or son. But both can forgive the other, something that Ruth's Jewish family cannot do. (That, by the way, should not be seen as representative of all Jews; indeed, the epilogue shows a moving scene in which James McBride gets in touch with his Jewish side in a very positive way. Many Jewish people are caring and understanding and not at all prejudice against blacks. Ruth's family wasn't among them.) Anyway, that these are not saints make the people more human, more believeable, more loveable. And by reading it, maybe we would become more accepting of families that don't look like our own. (Though I have to confess, I might be a little worried if a family with 12 kids moved in next door, regardless of the racial makeup! :-) )	2002-04-29

And what is the deal with this new Thorne character? Clearly, he was brought in so that Marius could have someone to tell his life story to, but it was never fully explained why he was so angry at Maharet. And why did he feel it necessary to take revenge on Santino on Marius's behalf? The whole Thorne plotline made no sense whatsoever, and was far more frustrating than the Marius story, which for all its repetition, at least kept my attention for being told from a different viewpoint.<br /><br />At least Anne Rice's storytelling is up to her usual lush standards, the Thorne plotline notwithstanding. We get her beautiful descriptions of the ancient and Renaissance times, as well as that of the 1700s. We learn more about Bianca and her relationship to Marius, as well as what it meant for him to guard the secret of Those Who Must Be Kept for so long. So it is not a total waste of time. But don't buy the hardcover version -- save a few dollars and buy the paperback.	2002-04-09

I didn't read this at a time of grief, but rather for a book club. However, I am in the process of signing up as a Hospice volunteer, so death and grieving were in my mind when I was reading \\"A Grief Observed.\\" C.S. Lewis doesn't pull any punches with his grief or with God. He asks tough questions of what kind of God allows such immeasurable pain, yet seems to not be there when the pain and grieving are at their worst. By reading this, others would feel they have permission to be angry at God, to let out their pain and frustration and anger. A great book, especially for those whose faith development is at a high level.	2002-03-22

Few of the characters were likeable, there were far more subplots than necessary, and as a previous reader noted, it could have easily been 300 words shorter. But somehow, the story of a small town in 1960, with all its meandering plots, its residents' twisted lives, secrets, desires, and blind spots, pulled me along. As unlikeable as the characters were, they were believable, and ultimately, that is what kept me going through 740 pages. At least they were 740 relatively fast pages. The one exception to the believablity quotient was that Norm, after 650 pages of hating Omar Duval, suddenly fell under his spell for about 50 pages. The sudden change of heart made no sense and seemed entirely plot driven. At least Norm did come to his senses pretty quickly!	2002-03-20

This is a beautifully told tale of how women learn, love, laugh, and live together. At the center of it all is Dinah, the only surviving daughter Jacob and his four wives. She becomes not only the repository of the saga of her four mothers, but becomes the bearer of her own story, as her brothers twists the love of her life into an awful rape (the story as we get in our Bible) and leave behind a massacre so awful, it forces Dinah to flee her family and start a new life as a midwife in Egypt. The rich detail, the descriptions, the dialog, the portrayal of feelings, are all what the Bible truly might have been like, if it has been written by women.<br /><br />Some have criticized the deviations from the Bible in this work. First of all, this is fiction, and should be treated as such. Secondly, those who are offended by the way God and the men who follow God are portrayed, let me offer this: Look at how the men of God behave in Genesis! Jacob and his sons are hardly role models in their Biblical portrayals. Why should Anita Diamant give them any better treatment? Whatever your religious inclinations are, \\"The Red Tent\\" brings alive an ancient time, and is beautifully written. Definitely highly recommended.	2002-02-18

Buechner's book is that, in reading about his early journey toward finding Christ, it really will, as so many have noted, help you reflect on your journey. Buechner writes about how our lives are like novels, that they have a structure and a meaning, and indeed, they do, if we take the time to delve into them and try to process them. God, of course, is the Author of that meaning, and as Buechner finds meaning in his life, so too can we find meaning in ours. This is one I am sure I will read again and again. (Fair warning -- the cover photograph will come to haunt you as you read about what happens to Buechner's father!)	2002-02-10

Penny can, in her own way, see the failings of Isabel in her efforts to rally the troops, but Mahalia becomes Isabel's most faithful disciple -- a sort of backhanded way to rebel against her fiery mother. The story may seem to be about abortion, but it is more about how religion is used by people as a controlling device, an escape valve, a way to judge people, anything but what it is supposed to be.	2002-02-09

I say I hate to admit it because the book just simply meandered too much -- flowing into the past, going hither and yon, digging into parts of the past that really didn't reveal much about the characters. The information about Sarath and his brother, ultimately, proved fairly revealing, but all that stuff about Anil and her friend Leaf could have been left out in favor of more information about the political underpinnings of the novel. We get hints, for example, that Sarath may have mixed motives in his involvement in working with Anil, but they are never made clear, so Anil's actions toward the end of the novel don't make as much sense.<br /><br />Still, what makes &quot;Anil's Ghost&quot; worthwhile is Ondaatje's beautiful, poetic writing style, his unerring sense of place, and his ability to reveal layers of characters, like pealing layers of an onion. And yes, sometimes making us cry in the process. I expect to see this book not only perused in book clubs, but in college literature classes as well, as students ponder Ondaatje's use of water, of eyes and faces, of family relations, in this novel.	2002-02-09

At the heart is the romance between the drifter, Charlie Memphis, and Teal, and how it touches the lives of everyone around them.<br /><br />Claude, the husband, is a jerk, and he didn't get what was coming to him. That made me mad. Also, I didn't like the &quot;wrap-up&quot; method used in the final chapter to summarize the 36 years between the time the main story ends and when the bones on the drive-in property were found.

Martin's review that Michel and Herbeck do an excellent job of &quot;de-demonizing&quot; Timothy McVeigh, though by the same token, they hardly make him a sympathetic person. Instead, the authors present a balanced view of who the Oklahoma City bomber was, as a human, a soldier, and an anti-government activitist who took his views to unimaginable extremes. What is especially scary is realizing that McVeigh could have been anybody's kid growing up next door. Many kids survive harsh blizzards, go through a divorce, have bad experiences with bullies. He's certainly not the first soldier to have regrets about killing someone in the line of duty. To think that something about him made him hate the government so much and react so strongly to what happened in Waco makes one pause. You don't have to be a total wacko to blow up a building and murder innocent people. You could be anyone's neighbor or friend.<br /><br />One thing I found odd was the repeated contention that McVeigh did not know there was a daycare in the building until after the bombing, and that he might not have chosen to bomb the Murrah building had he known about the daycare. Apparently, he only knew what offices were in the building by looking in the phone book. And he only cased the outside of the building. Because the windows were black, he contends, he could not see inside and view the daycare. It would seem to me, though, a well-trained and highly decorated soldier like him would have thought to have cased the *inside* of the building, as wellas the outside. That shouldn't have been hard to do, given the lack of security in most federal buildings at the time. I can't speak for the security of the Murrah federal building, but my then-husband worked at the federal building in Kansas City around the time of the Oklahoma City bombing, and I can assure you, McVeigh would have had no problem going into the building to assess for himself what facilities were inside.<br /><br />Bottom line: this book will give the reader an unbiased, balanced view of who Tim McVeigh is and what his mindset was leading up to the bombing, as well as his thoughts on his defense.his book will give the reader an unbiased, balanced view of who Tim McVeigh is and what his mindset was leading up to the bombing, as well as his thoughts on his defense.	2001-12-24

The fictional Gunn seems to have no morals and little remorse for his actions, yet by the end of the novel, we come to understand why the fictional James Gunn is the angry young man he is. Only then can we be sympathetic with him. Until then, he is just an angry, albeit funny, young man. Still, it was a captivating and amusing book.	2001-12-05

But I digress.) After reading the tales of the five exorcisms, so skillfully and convincingly presented, I am left with new questions about the existence of some sort of personification of evil. Is there, in fact, a Satan, a literal Lucifer, and his minions, out to possess and destroy as many of God's creatures as he can? It seems as though the evidence is pointing a bit more toward &quot;yes&quot; as the answer.<br /><br />I am left with several more questions that Martin failed to answer. First, it is one thing to empty these victims of possession of evil spirits, but then, isn't it important to fill them up with the Holy Spirit? We can presume this, but it is an important part of the equation that Martin leaves out of these stories. Otherwise, as in the story Jesus tells, the evil spirit will come back to the clean, but empty, house, and bring seven of his evil spirit companions, and the condition of the poor person will be worse than it was before! (See Matthew 12:43-45.) Second, do Catholics have the market cornered on exorcising demons? What if a charasmatic fundamentalist were to confront a possessed person? Or a mainline Protestant? Would they be unable to exorcise the demon? I can see a charasmatic faith healer, for example, praying over a possessed person and immediately calling out the evil spirit in the name of Jesus Christ and expecting the spirit to immediately leave the person! I'm not saying one way is better than another, but I wonder if Martin is. The book certainly made me ask more questions and become more prayerful about the topic. In that sense, the book served its purpose.	2001-12-02

We can see ourselves as the Prodigal son easily enough -- the sinner who must find our way back to our Father. But Nouwen challenges us, calling us to see Jesus as the Prodigal Son, then calls us to see ourselves as the elder son, and then as the father, to forgive others as well as to accept forgiveness. I found this book both challenging and comforting, and a book I wanted to buy for others.	2001-11-17

Imagine my surprise when I turned the pages of the book to find that I was NORMAL for feeling angry and depressed! Giving validation for my feelings, and taking ownership of them, gave me what I needed to master them and move on, standing up for what I needed in the divorce process and giving myself permission to cry sometimes. This book helped me become stronger and showed me that there can be a brighter future after divorce. I highly recommend this for anyone going through a divorce, especially those in &quot;crazy time&quot; whose feelings are not being validated. Divorce is the death of a dream, maybe in some ways worse than the loss of a loved one through a natural death, and it is okay to grieve. This book can help people cope with that loss, learn from it, and move on to a better life.	2001-11-07

Warning: Before you start reading this book, you better make sure you don't have anything else planned for the next several hours, like household chores, dinner, sleep, that kind of thing. You will find it that hard to put this book down.<br />'The Absence of Nectar' is told from the point of view of 12-year-old Alice, whose life is turned upside down by two seemingly unrelated events. Her older brother Boone is writing to Perseley, an often-escaping teenage girl locked up for poisoning her parents with Tang. Meanwhile, the mysterious Simon Jester has entered the picture, saving their mother from drowning, marrying her, and seeming as intent to poison his step children, now that his own child is on the way, as Perseley was to poison her parents.<br />Though some of the plot twists are predictable, others are not, leaving the reader guessing the outcome until the very end. But more than a mystery, 'The Absence of Nectar' is a moving coming-of-age story about first love, conflicting loyalties between families and lovers, God versus fate. Definitely a page turner on many levels, this is a great selection for book clubs as well as for general reading. Oprah, are you listening?	2001-09-23

I have long been intrigued by this Catholic priest so often quoted by my Protestant pastors, and this book was recommended by one of them at a low point in my life.<br />Nouwen's spirituality and humanity come through so well through the pages of this journal. His reflections as he celebrates the Eucharist on a nearly daily basis are a source of spiritual food that sustains not only his community of friends (and he has many!) but his readers as well. He also writes about the tug of war he feels between wanting to write more, yet wanting to be available as a pastor for his friends, to preside over their weddings and baptisms and funerals. The anguish he feels over the death of Adam, a young disabled man who brought him to the Daybreak community he pastored for the last decade of his life, brought tears to my eyes. And he talks candidly about his hurts and disappointments, his anxieties and his fatigue, a haunting undercurrent, given the knowledge that three weeks after his final entry, he died of a massive coronary.<br />In short, you have to love, respect, and listen to a priest with the courage to write &quot;...my faith and unbelief are never far from each other. Maybe it is exactly at the place where they touch each other that the growing edge of my life is&quot; (p. 143). I am sorry I will never meet Nouwen in person, but I look forward to getting to know him better through his writings, and I look forward to someday meeting him in God's kingdom in Heaven.	2001-07-30

The question then becomes, were Elphaba, Nessarose and Galinda merely pawns, or did they have a choice in their actions? Is Elphaba truly wicked?

(The novel I'm working on cuts across several genres.) I love vampire books, but I'm not a big fan of hard-core detective novels, so I wasn't sure if I would like this or not. The emphasis, it seemed to me, was on the detective genre. Yes, Jack becomes a vampire and he has to deal with his new undead status, but it seems his top priority is to remember how he got dead in the first place and solve his own murder. Though I suppose if I had a chance to solve my own murder, and I could do it by becoming invisible and floating through walls, I'd do it, too!<br />Because of Jack's amnesia regarding the days immediately preceding his murder, the mystery is rather murky until the very end. Who are these guys, and why do they want him dead, anyway? Still, the action is exciting, the scenes in which Jack &quot;haunts&quot; the bad guys are a hoot, and the payoff is worth the wait. Admittedly, this novel won't get me to jump on the hardboiled detective bandwagon, but I might read more in this series.	2001-06-03

Walter Wangerin brings his readers a fine story of the Apostle Paul, from his time as a pharisee and persecutor of those following &quot;The Way&quot; to a crusader for the Gentiles. Although the story itself is fiction, it is grounded in passages of Acts and Paul's letters, as well as in the larger Truth of Christ's love and sacrifice freeing us from the constrictive Laws of Moses to the freedom of living under love for God and for others.<br />Indeed, I'd recommend this book simply because it describes so vividly both sides of an argument that nearly tore the First Century believers apart -- whether Gentile converts must follow Jewish laws, most notably that of undergoing circumcism. As a Christian living nearly 2000 years after the birth of the Church, I barely understood why there was an argument argument, let alone both sides of it. It may also serve as a reminder for Christians today who bicker and argue over Biblical interpretation that the Church has survived many a disagreement before, and it will again.<br />The book also humanizes Paul, showing him as someone who could find joy -- I mean heart-felt, giggling joy -- in the salvation of Christ, as well as someone who felt immense sorrow and anger. Wangerin also gives us a plausible explanation for the &quot;thorn&quot; Paul obliquely describes in his writings. Of course, all those whippings and the stoning were bound to leave him a physically broken man, so while we can't take that explanation as gospel (no pun intended), we can at least take it as a reasonable explantion.<br />Finally, the book is well written, and each voice that tells its part of the story is unique. You will not, for example, confuse Prisca's narrative with Titus's! All in all, a wonderful book, well worth the time it takes to read such a long and involved narrative.	2001-05-26

I do not normally read romance novels, but I bought this one because Sabrina Jeffries was a speaker at a writer's conference in Oklahoma I attended, and I was sufficiently impressed with her talk on how to write sensual dialog that I decided to give her work a try. I was not disappointed. Her characters are clearly written and have clear motivations, her dialog is snappy, and her sensual scenes are, well, sensual. This book accomplished its mission -- it swept me up and made me regret each time I had to put it down. I probably would buy more of her books, based on how much I enjoyed this one.	2001-05-11

I certainly don't want to be an apologist for Carrie, or for her real-life counterparts, but this novel should be a lesson--whether King meant to teach it or not--that the bullying and teasing and harassing kids can do in school has severe, negative emotional consequences on the victim. So first and foremost, this book is excellent because King is able to make his readers root for a character who exacts revenge on her tormentors in a most spectacular fashion.<br />&quot;Carrie&quot; also is a good read because of the use of &quot;book&quot; and &quot;commission&quot; references King sticks in throughout as a device to move the action along. This allows the reader to get a &quot;distance&quot; perspective of events even as the events are unfolding. It also lends &quot;credibility&quot; to the story, giving the reader the feeling that this story is factual, and as such, far more scary.	2001-05-06
US	53016908	R2VYT2NC5LY74E	0425178102	857420607	Big Trouble	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Hilarious	As as satire of crime fiction, this book fits the bill and then some. The situations are hilarious, as are the pratfalls of the zany cast of characters. And Barry's description of Miami life, and especially Miami International Airport, are not exaggerated all that much. Not what the chamber of commerce types want to hear, but I used to live in Miami and I have been through that airport enough times to know how inhospitable it can seem at times.<br />I do agree with those who would have left out the &quot;exposing the titties&quot; scene. Near rape is not funny. But the rest of the book is, and that near-rape scene is about as humorous as such a scene can be. So I'll cut Barry some slack, this time.	2001-04-13

I loved the purple cloth-lined covers, the gorgeous illustrations, even the typeface. It had the feel of a book from 100 years ago.<br />Unfortunately, I found the content to be somewhat superficial, and all the sidebars got distracting after a while. I wanted more details, especially on the uses of opium by writers and other artists, and some idea whether the use of opium enhanced or inhibited creativity. The writing style itself had the feel of a term paper, albeit a term paper on a college level. I'd give the book five stars for looks, but only 2-1/2 stars for content. Since I weigh content more heavily than looks, then I have to give this one three stars.	2001-03-31

I especially liked his use of amusing anecdotes and examples of how to and how NOT to write in certain ways. Most such tips, of course, are timeless, but the fact this book came out in the mid-1980s shows. His information on how to format a manuscript for submission assumes the use of a typewriter, not a computer with sophisticated word processing programs. Also, the book says nothing in its section on research on how to navigate the Internet to find needed information. Why bother the nice woman at your local library with questions about annual tomato yields in Florida when a few clicks of the mosue will give you the same information?<br />If Mr. Provost had issued an updated edition of this book, I'd have given it five stars. You might want to consider it, Mr. Provost. If you for whatever reason can't take on such a project, email me, and I'll be happy to help you out...	2001-03-24

The mamma responds to the daddy's depression by giving him chairs to paint, hoping to make him feel useful and needed. True, painting and other creative endeavors can help people who are depressed. That's the whole point behind art therapy often used in hospital settings. However, the author made it seem as though the daddy's depression went away after he painted the chairs. Painting may have eased the depression, but it can't cure the person.<br />That said, I still recommend this book because it resonnated well with my children. My five-year-old especially likes this book and has asked me to read it to her several times. Maybe I judge &quot;unrealistic&quot; optimism aimed at children too harshly. Perhaps children who have a parent with depression need such an upbeat and hopeful story to help them cope with the stress and confusion they feel.	2001-03-21

I thought this book did a much better job than the other one I bought. Amanda Martha's mother suffers from depression, and the daughters asks the usual questions: Is it my fault? Can I make you feel better? And the mother gives the right answers: It's not your fault. It's not your job to make you feel better.<br /><br />The mother's depression was protrayed very realistically, I thought. Some days she's very down and can't even get out of her bathrobe. Other days, she can get dressed, but she's not happy. Some days, she is happy. There are no quick fixes here. However, there is a sense of hope, that when the family pulls together, the necessary work will get done and love will be shared in abundance. This book should be available for all parents who have been diagnosed with depression and who have young children.	2001-03-18

I am so thrilled I found this book first. From reading this book, I have a much deeper understanding of the biological origins of my disorder, as well as the symptoms to watch out for. I especially appreciate the attention Dr. Quinn gives to &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms and bi-polar disorders; I suspect I had been depressed for years, but because my symptoms don't fit the usual criteria, it went unrecognized for far too long.<br />Dr. Quinn also is to be commended for striking the right balance between helping people with mood disorders and their families understand that their symptoms are not their fault and that they are not &quot;weak&quot; for not being able to &quot;snap out of it,&quot; while still explaining concrete steps patients and their families can take to alleviate symptoms and stay well as best they can. It is hard for most people who have never experienced depression how difficult it is to convince yourself that you are a worthy, competent person, that people love and care about you, that the world is a good place to be in, when the illness is at its worst, and all you can see is the dark pit of despair. Dr. Quinn gives people in such states real hope; rather than spouting out meaningless phrases of &quot;you're an okay person&quot; or &quot;people love you&quot; when people who are seriously depressed CANNOT believe it, he explains how medicine, therapy, and alternative treatments can help them get out of that pit so they CAN believe they are worthy people deserving of love.<br />While I am a &quot;traditionalist&quot; in my medical thinking, and I have no problem with taking pills to help my symptoms improve, I was glad to see that Dr. Quinn gave plenty of space to alternative treatments, and did so without either touting them as cure-alls or cutting them down. In fact, some of the suggestions in the alternative treatment section are helpful even for those who are comfortable taking medications for their mood disorders.<br />This book should be required reading, not just for those who have a mood disorder, but by their families and friends.

(Same with the movie, and there, my resistance has held out.) Based on what I had heard, this book was nothing but an overwrought piece of mush. ...<br />Yes, this book is mushy, but not the overwrought, saccherine kind of mush it has been portrayed to be. Francesca is lonely and bored and understandably so. She was, after all, an Italian native raised to be a literature teacher, ending up a farmer's wife in a place where her talents go unrecognized (more on this later). Certainly, someone with an artistic and sensitive temperament that Robert Kincaid posesses would be attractive to her, and vice versa. And while adultery is not something to be celebrated or considered a virtue, I think both of them handled the situation as well as they could have, once they went down the path of loving each other. I do think Richard comes out as more of an oaf than he probably deserved, though. (Again, more on this coming up.) Understand, this is not Shakespeare, this is not Charles Dickens, or George Orwell, or even Anne Rice. This is a light read, meant to appeal to your heart, rather than your mind. I didn't give this book a high rating because it's one of the best I've ever read, but rather because the book was good reading, and it achieved its desired result. Fair enough.<br />The one disappointment is the way the citizens of Winterset, Iowa, are portrayed. I think Waller was very unforgiving. I spent most of my childhood in Iowa -- albeit in the relatively urban area of Dubuque -- and my dad was born and raised on farms in southwestern Iowa. Waller is right on the surface. These rural farming communities tend to be populated by people who are more concerned about weather conditions, the state of the crops, what's happening in so-and-so's lives, than they are in deep philosophical meanings of life. So what? These are people whose lives depend on the whims of Nature, who often can barely eke out a credible existence in years when droughts or floods or ill-timed frost ruin months of hard work. And, the fact that the people of Winterset, Iowa -- in fiction or in real life -- don't talk about taking time to consider the beauty of their bridges, the awesome colors of a sunset, or whatever, doesn't mean those thoughts are never in their heads. Farming is a hard life, however rewarding it may be, and it takes a stronger person than I am to do it. Waller should have respected that in his narration.ghts or floods or ill-timed frost ruin months of hard work.

I suspected it took place then, but I didn't know it was written then. My second shock was at how modern the book sounded. It read as if it were written in 1995, not 1955. I'm not sure how to describe it. It's something in the use of language, point of view, maybe even in the references early on to Ripley's troubled childhood. Maybe we assume that only in the last ten or so years can a book be written in which we are compelled to root for a murderous, selfish character.<br />I thought Ripley is every bit as talented as the title suggests, the way he thinks through just about everything, and manages to improvise when things don't quite go the way he hopes. My one disappointment, though, is that the ending sort of petered out. It had suspense, but I just didn't buy into the buildup. But don't let that distract you from reading the book. Heck, maybe you'll disagree with me about the ending!	2001-02-18

I enjoyed reading the interaction between Monica and Sheila, how they both seemed to need each other, yet could bring out the worst in each other. However, I never understood why Monica became so obsessed with Sheila and her work. Opposites may attract, but these two women don't even have opposites in common, other than in Sheila's dark looks and Monica's blonde radiance. They are simply two completely different women. I suspect this book is best suited to reading in a college classroom setting, with ample opportunities for discussion and feedback on what this book &quot;means.&quot; Or perhaps as a book club selection.

(You have to wonder back in the height of the Reagan years which aspect of Brooks would have been more upsetting to the &quot;average&quot; folks.) As a rough contemporary of the fictional Eric and Brooks, I found both the racial tensions and the fears associated with coming out to be very true to the times in which they were written. I also liked the juxtaposition of the socio-economic levels -- it was the white boy who was poor and the black boy who was rich. Murphy didn't forget that, either, playing up the reaction of parents of the boys who beat up Brooks upon discovering that Brooks was a rich prep school boy and not your &quot;ordinary&quot; inner city kid.<br />Some people found the subplots involving Eric's family distracting, but I enjoyed them. For one thing, it helped center Eric and gave him more depth as a character. For another, it gave him a far better foil in Brenda than he ever had in Phoebe, who I found to be annoying.<br />I do have to agree with other reviewers who found the ending a little pat and contrived. Eric's about-face, if you will, seems too sudden, and I suspect that he will never completely abandon his quest for &quot;conventional&quot; success.	2001-01-26

You know this book is thick with information when the introduction runs over 100 pages, and the first page of the Oz story is accompanied by six pages of annotations! I learned so much about Baum, Denslow, and the psycho-social and political aspects of Oz from this book (as well as what politics are NOT involved!).

Merrick as a character is a masterpiece -- she is strong and manipulative, yet at times when she appears weak and in need of help (like at the end of the novel), she is still believable. Louis's search for absolution from the child-vampire Claudia is heart-rendering, yet shows the inner strength of a vampire often portrayed as weak. And the rise of Lestat and the ultimatum issued by the Talamasca promise the reader more excellent sequels in the future.<br />What I did not understand was how this book could be advertised as a combining of the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair witches. That Merrick is a Mayfair seems to be just a footnote -- she knows almost nothing about her white cousins, nothing at all about their struggle with Lashar and Taltos. Perhaps Anne Rice will explore these connections in future novels, but for now, Merrick could have just as easily been any New Orleans witch of mixed ancestry, and the power of the book would have been retained. And unlike such books as the original &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and &quot;Memnoch the Devil,&quot; we don't get much discussion on philoisophical issues that I have grown to love so much in Rice's books. These issues do come up, of course, particularly the questions of what happens to spirits, the pluses and drawbacks to the Dark Gift, the strength it takes to end an &quot;immortal&quot; life, what it means to gain immortality at the age of 70 than as a young adult. Maybe there were too many issues for any one to be explored extensively. But the lack of indepth treatment does not detract from the story, and in fact for some, may be a bonus.	2000-12-19

I would definitely read more of her work.	2000-12-15

A lack of modesty on women's part does seem to lead to a lot of heartache, objectifcation by men towards women, and a general sense of &quot;if you aren't doing it, something is wrong with you.&quot; I had my share of heartache and feeling like I was nothing but a sex object in my young adulthood, and I can see now in the way teens and young adult women dress and act that modesty is something sorely lacking in society.<br />That said, I have to wonder how pervasive this problem really is, especially with &quot;older&quot; women (by older, I mean past mid-20s), and in areas of the country that are not overrun with urbanization. Most of my friends are married, and either had no other sex partners but their husbands, or at most one or two others. I know far more women who saved their virginities for someone special, than those who had sex early and often. (Though I have to agree with Wendy that those who waited are generally happier!)<br /> I am glad that Wendy thought to include men's thoughts on the matter.

My only complaint is not enough attention was given to the modern question of homophobia, with the last 30 years wrapped up in mere pages. A historical perspective is great, but only if it is related to how things stand today. I would have liked to have seen more about how AIDS may have set back gay rights in the 1980s, the successes and failures of legislative attempts to both enhance and take away from the rights of our g/l/b/t brothers and sisters.

So of course I had to get this book. For the most part, this book satisfied both cravings. I learned more about Bible places and personalities, sayings and history, than I thought possible in one book.<br />That said, I found the book biased to some degree to the conservative view (though give Lang credit for noting that the Bible is not a science book.) For example, in talking about Campbell and the Campbellites, he seemed to favor the conservative offshoot, the Churches of Christ, over the more liberal Disciples of Christ. I've been in the Churches of Christ and am now a member of the Disciples of Christ, and having seen both sides, I'd argue that the DOC follows more closely the spirit of first century Christian worship, contrary to Lang's opinion (which he shoud have stated as such. More disturbing, under the heading of &quot;excommunication,&quot; he uses the passage in Matthew 18:15-17 to justify shunning the unrepentant, that we are to treat them as &quot;a Gentile and a tax collector.&quot; But as a Christian mediator once pointed out, Jesus treated tax collectors and Gentiles as humans worthy of his love, even to the point of eating with them. Wonder if Lang had thought of that interpretation? So bottom line, read it for the facts, but if your views are more liberal, you might find Lang's views a little hard to swallow.	2000-11-04

What I enjoyed most, though, was how accurately Austin was portrayed as a man coping with the loss of a lover. He was very devoted and loving, to be sure, but he also had periods of frustration and anger, followed by guilt and regrets. Although I never had close family or friends succumb to AIDS, I have lost several family members to cancer, and my real experiences and feelings were very much like Austin's fictional ones. Julien and Peter, too, I thought were depicted honestly and without varnish as men facing death before their time. A great novel, both in its own right and as a book to help people with their grief.	2000-10-30

The characters, particularly the three main ones, and Bob, were well drawn and believable. In fact, my biggest reason for recommending the book would be because the characters with developmental disabilities, Lena and Bob, were so realistically portrayed. I had an older sister with mental retardation, and I could see her and others I knew with mental retardation doing the kinds of things Lena and Bob did. I do wish Vivien had been fleshed out more. I would like to have seen in more detail how she dealt with having a sister with mental retardation, especially as she began dating, and how she related to her parents as the &quot;normal&quot; daughter. I think the few problems Vivien encountered growing up with a handicapped sister were glossed over	2000-10-19

He presents the archetypes, both in plots and in characters. He explains the probable origins of the stories, as well as what they can (and cannot!) teach us about God today. And, thankfully, he gives us a good overview of each of the stories. (I say thankfully because as a Protestant, I have almost no experience with the Apocrypha.

Overall, I enjoyed all the stories, but I found some of them to be rather uninspired. The premise behind &quot;Velvet Glove,&quot; for example, seemed unoriginal (though kudos for at least making the unoriginal reasonably interesting). Others, though, were creative, exciting, and thought-provoking. I especially loved &quot;Water Color&quot; for its playfulness, &quot;The Addiction&quot; for its serious and painful take of the phenomina of cybering, and &quot;Fisherman's Friend&quot; for being the flat out most sexy of the bunch.

As much trust as we put in our doctors, even in this age of HMO nightmares, it is horrifying to think that a doctor put his ego and his theories ahead of the feelings and thoughts of a vulnerable child. Reading this story made me furious at Dr. Money, angry at the doctors and psychologists who could clearly see the experiment of turning a normal boy into a girl was a miserable failure but didn't have the guts to speak up,  and made me feel sympathy for David and his family. Colapinto was smart in pointing out that it wasn't just David who suffered because of the absurd attempt to turn him into a girl after a botched circumcision. This was a family tragedy, after all, not just David's. With the evidence of David's story and those of others who were assigned a sex without considering their feelings, I have to wonder why nothing has been done to revoke Money's licence to practice psychology.	2000-10-01

But this is more. This story is about the ability of love to conquer even death, the pain of sexual abuse and the strength to overcome it, the fine line between prejudice and jealousy, and the secrets that hide behind the closed doors of the &quot;perfect&quot; family. Best of all, the ending was a surprise, both in terms of what happens to Nathan and what doesn't. The characters are real people, not stereotypes of macho or weakling (except maybe Burke, but even he packs a few surprises.) The dreamy use of words, combined with the present tense, gives the reader an impression of a dream, yet a dream that is all too real.	2000-09-21

Like others, I was a  little frustrated with the lack of specific source citation. Bawer does  give us a bibliography at the end, but I would have liked to have had  specific references to specific works he quotes, which he does not always  do. And, a minor but important point: Bawer points out that legalistic  Protestant churches are very segregated; you'll seldom see a black face in  a white church. True, but unfortunately, the same can be said for mainline  Protestant churches, too.<br />That said, I still say this book is a must  read. Bawer does an excellent job of explaining how the fundamentalists (or  &quot;legalistic Protestants,&quot; as he prefers to call them) became the  power they are today, and why they are so dangerous as they worm their  narrow-minded, God-as-wrathful-avenger views into mainstream society. This  book has inspired me to renew my own commitment to God, not the  fundamentalist &quot;god,&quot; but the God of Love, the God who gave us  his Son, not as currency with which we buy our ticket to Heaven, but as a  perfect example of His love, which we in turn, having accepted that love,  try our best to emulate.<br />To underscore Bawer's point, I got email while  I was reading the book from a friend who goes to a fundamentalist church.  She wondered if she should feel guilty for hanging up on a solicitor who  represented some charity, when she had just given, not only money, but her  considerable artistic talent, to no less than four other charities! This is  a classic example of how legalistic thinking has made her feel guilty for  what she hasn't done, rather than feeling good and thankful for what she  has done. I think she's getting a copy of this book!	2000-09-13

The &quot;protagonist&quot; is one Ignatius J. Reilly, a fat,  pompus windbag who is over-educated, but refuses to work, preferring to  stay home and drive his mother nuts while writing his never-ending treastie  on the awfulness of the modern world -- &quot;modern&quot; meaning anything  since early Medieval times! Thanks to his mother running into a building  while under the influence, Ignacious has to go to work. You can just about  imagine the kind of worker he is, versus the kind of worker he really is!  You wouldn't want to leave this guy alone with a typewriter, or even a  hot-dog cart, for a minute.<br />John Kennedy Toole does not just depict  Ignatius's delusions, but brilliantly depicts everyone else's delusions,  too. His novel shows us that none of us operate in a concrete reality --  our perceptions are deluded because of our beliefs, worldview, past  experiences, etc. This book should be assigned, or at least recommended,  reading for any college course dealing with post-Modern thought.	2000-09-07

I had some doubts about reading &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; since my only other exposure to Henry Miller was from reading &quot;Under the Roofs  of Paris.&quot; (&quot;Under the Roofs&quot; has some pretty bizarre sexual  situations that even I found offensive!) But &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;  gives the reader a portrait of a man who loves life despite -- or maybe  because of -- adverse circumstances. Miller has a keen eye, sharp wit, and  an uncanny ability to find the philosophical in the mundane, and the  mundane in the philosophical.<br />I would have given this book five stars,  except that Miller constantly uses a crude word for the female anatomy to  refer to women -- especially those he and his friends sleep with. Strange  that someone who is otherwise so forward thinking tends to objectify women.	2000-09-02

I don't intend for this to be my last introduction.  I laughed out loud at some of the hilarious tales Sedaris tells, which  sometimes are so outlandish, they can only be true. (Hording spoiled fruit?  A brother who talks to his dad like he would his bar buddy? Performance art  with sock puppets? No one can make up this stuff!) His essays on the more  mundane, like the challenge of New York Times crossword puzzles and the  idiosyncracies of Americans in Paris, are also funny. It might take a  certain sense of humor to get some of this, though. I read a few stories  out loud to my husband, and he didn't laugh at all of them.

A large chunk of the beginning is devoted to the story of their parents,  especially their father, Milton Wright. The father, a preacher and bishop  in the United Brethern denomination, stuck to his guns about certain  beliefs, even when they led to scisms and lawsuits. Knowing this helps  explain to the readers why the brothers did some things, particularly  regarding the patent lawsuits, that seem selfish or greedy. Crouch gives us  a portrait of the two that neither puts them on pedestals or demeans them,  but shows them as humans.<br />The one drawback, at least for readers more  interested in people than in their inventions, was that some of the  information regarding the early planes could get awfully technical at  times. I understood most of it, but it was a struggle, and it slowed the  pace somewhat. Unfortunately, you probably can't have a decent biography of  the Wrights without this information, and some might even enjoy it.	2000-08-27

Stevens, the  oh-so-pompous butler who narrates this novel, thinks he has carried out his  functions as a butler to an English lord with suspicious ties to the Nazis  in a way that exemplifies dignity. Although he expresses doubts about the  lord he serves, ultimately, he is nothing more than a robot, carrying out  orders without thought or regard to their consequences.<br /><br />More  disturbing, though, is Steven's lack of emotions, as well as his inability  to understand the emotions of others. As a reader, I wanted to knock some  sense into this guy, yet Ishiguro does a masterful job of making the reader  care about this butler, even if he has the EQ (emotional quotent) of a  gnat!	2000-08-23

Rather, it  is the sense of foreboding, of struggling to conquer childhood hurts and  broken relationships, that provide the horror in these tales.

His characters are over  the top, overwrought, and overindulge in everything from drugs to  &quot;nasty&quot; little sex games. Underneath all the excess, though, are  characters who are looking for love in all the wrong places, in all the  wrong people, and for all the wrong reasons. I suspect that those in New  York's Gay ghettos of the late 1970's, though, were, and are, not the only  ones who struggle with the boundaries of love and sex, when they cross and  when they don't, and the pain and emptiness of pursuing sex to the  exclusion of love.<br />Two aspects about Kramer's writing style, though, did  bother me. First, so many characters ran in and out of the novel that I  couldn't keep track of them all. Could we have done without, say, Gatsby,  Paulie, or even Anthony, and still had a great story? I think so. Also,  Kramer's deliberate use of run-on sentences made the narrative hard to  follow at times. I can live with run-on sentences to some degree (just read  my sentences sometime), but some of Kramer's were too convoluted even for  me. Still, a book worth reading.	2000-08-12

Not because it was a badly written book, or because it wasn't a story worth telling. On the contrary, the book was reasonably well-written, and stories of how badly some of our children are  abused by those who are supposed to love and protect them need desperately  to be told. I hated reading this book because I was so angry at both of  David's parents, so frustrated that the signs of abuse went on for so long,  that at times I just wanted to fling the book across the room, crawl in a  corner, and cry my eyes out. It was, frankly, almost too painful to read.<br />A couple aspects of the book itself did disappoint me. Mainly, I wanted  to know what in the world happened to David's mom to turn from such a  loving woman into such a monster. And why did she turn her wrath on David,  as opposed to the other children? That drove me nuts, wondering what it was  she perceived about David that made him, and not the brothers, the object  of her cruelty. (Please understand, I do not suggest in any way that David  &quot;asked&quot; for the abuse. Rather, I am wondering what was going on  in her warped mind that would lead her to think David, and only David,  deserved this. Or were the other boys abused, in ways David, as a child,  could not comprehend?) We never get the answers, or even any kind of  educated speculation. Maybe David addresses this in the other two books,  but as angry and depressed as I got reading this book, I'm not sure I can  emotionally handle reading the other two books any time soon.	2000-08-01

However, the book was poorly organized, with the author jumping  from topic to topic without any transition or explanation. The editors  didn't help much -- the layout of the book is such that the reader cannot  easily discern when one chapter has ended and the next has begun. Finally,  Ms. Plant failed to give specific sources for her information. Yes, there  is a list of references, but within the text, one cannot tell where she got  her information. This is especially disconcerting when she goes on about  the CIA involvement in drugs. I don't necessarily dispute the accuracy, but  when someone makes such damning statements in public, she'd better be able  to back them up, or risk losing credibility.<br />In the final analysis, I'd  recommend waiting for the paperback.	2000-08-01

I read this book after being introduced to her in the &quot;Love in Vein&quot; series. I should have realized that the since Ms. Brite, edited, rather than wrote, the &quot;Love in Vein&quot; short stories, that they  would not reflect her true work. So I picked up &quot;Wormwood&quot;  expecting more erotica and less death than what I found. If I had known  more about Ms. Brite's work, I probably would not have read this one.<br />That said, I still found some of her stories enjoyable, particularly  &quot;The Sixth Sentinel&quot; and &quot;The Elder,&quot; both of which  involve a lot of heartache and loss. I liked getting to know Ghost and  Steve, as well. Overall, I did enjoy Ms. Brite's writing style, her ability  to describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the world around her so  vividly. If you like Gothic stuff, with lots of death and decaying bodies,  then you will probably love her short stories. If not, you might still  enjoy her writing style, but make sure you are in a very, very, good mood  -- you'll be depressed when you're done!	2000-08-01

But it was about so much more, about love  forbidden, about how mothers hurt their children and how children bounce  back and become better than their selfish mothers. I don't think this  should be read as condoning such relationships in general, but as a story  in its own right about a child forced to grow up too fast, who falls in  love with a man who has never really grown up, and helps him grow to his  full potential, too.<br />The only hard part, for me, was remembering that I  was reading a novel written some 15 years ago. For example, I was perplexed  at first that AIDS rumors could kill G.G.'s New York salon, until I  remembered this novel was written and set in a time when AIDS was not even  treatable, when we didn't fully even understand how it spread. (Remember  those rumors that mosquitoes spread AIDS? If that were true, we'd ALL be  infected by now. But I digress.) Anyway, if you read it as good fiction  with some meaning, you'll love it!	2000-08-01

His two characters, Jim and Abby, are at once trying  to find some sort of soul mate, yet both seem to derive the most sexual  pleasure from stimulating themselves.<br />  Interesting, too, how the  fantasies each spins for the other crumble and lose their erotic edge in  the telling. I especially thought I was going to scream with Abby's olive  oil story -- how dare she leave me hanging like that? But that, I guess, is  part of the point of taking self-indulgence to such an extreme that the  telling of the story overshadows the intent behind the story.

I bought this book at a time when both my husband and I had a lot of forgiving to do, of each other, of my father, of others in our lives. This little volume by Charles Klein sums up nicely the importance of forgiveness  in relationships, for both the one who seeks forgiveness and the one who  forgives. The best lessons in this book are, in my mind, 1. Love looks  forward; 2. Never let pride get in the way of asking for or giving  forgiveness, and 3. That relationships are not to be easily thrown away  when they are broken, or when the people in our relationships fail to  &quot;serve&quot; us. After reading this, I am all for the idea of a  National Reconcilation Day, when people take time to forgive, ask for  forgiveness, and make fresh starts in their relationships. The idea may  sound easy and trite, but one cannot accomplish the hard work of repairing  broken relationships without saying &quot;I'm sorry&quot; or &quot;I  forgive you.&quot; Thank you, Rabbi Klein, for reminding us of the  importance of those simple sentences!	2000-06-28

I haven't decided, after reading this, whether I like this or not. On one hand, I love her use of the English language, her spare style, her sense of  character and story-telling. On the other hand, too many of the stories  presented here ended abruptly, with no real sense of resolution or how the  characters got from point A to point B. The most glaring example is in the  story &quot;The Model,&quot; in which we get detailed descriptions of the  narrator's first two would-be lovers, but almost nothing about the third  guy. Flaws aside, this little volume is probably the best way to get  acquainted with Nin without investing too much.	2000-06-26

How many of us in our youth have felt the love for another that Chris felt for Stephen, and the utter sense of loss that comes if that love is betrayed.  How heartbreaking, too, that Chris had no one to turn to, no one to help  unfreeze his heart when he was young. The other characters, too, were  believable, like Chris's mom, who found her biggest adjustment to widowhood  was not living with loss, but living with freedom, and his sister, who just  cannot leave things alone. (Don't we all have such an annoying relative  lurking around!) I have to agree with a previous reviewer, though, who  thought the ending played out too quickly, Chris's recovery coming too  fast. 30 years of keeping your heart cold in order to protect yourself  cannot be reversed in one weekend. I think more of a buildup, perhaps  through a growing friendship with Hobbs, might have made Chris's catharsis  more believable.	2000-06-21

I think I enjoyed every one, for the story or for the sex, which is rare in a collection of short stories. I especially  enjoyed the humor of &quot;The Front Runner,&quot; the reconciliation in  &quot;I Wanted to,&quot; the complexity of &quot;Under the Volcano,&quot;  the unique experience in &quot;The Last Seduction.&quot; the fun of  &quot;Double Clicked.&quot; Most of these stories actually have plots and  characters readers care about, beyond merely wondering how many orgasms  they will have. My only complaint is with the introductions to each  section. I don't know what it is about them, but I just found them  unnecessary.	2000-06-21
US	53016908	RT2UT1G1FDIOQ	0385498861	202828439	Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Love, Kids and Life in a Half-Changed World	Books	4	10	11	N	N	A thoughtful compilation of life choices for women	Like one of the previous reviewers, I happened to find this book while wandering in a bookstore, while dealing with major questions regarding my career, my marriage, and whether I am a &quot;good enough&quot; mother.  This book didn't provide the nice, neat answers I thought I was looking  for, but Peggy Orenstein nonetheless does an excellent job of detailing the  lives of the women she profiles. She shows women at different stages of  their lives, faced with different choices about marriage, career,  motherhood, and gives the reader food for thought about the good and the  bad behind the choices made. The biggest change, though, must, as Ms.  Orenstein notes, come from culture as a whole. Men need to be given  permission, and in fact encouraged, to consider flex-time, stay-at-home  parenting, &quot;daddy tracks,&quot; and corporate culture needs to  encourage, not punish, those who take advantage of these opportunities to  nurture their families. For me personally, the best part of this book,  though, was the emphasis on the need for women to find their own  identities. Self actualization need not equal selfishness.	2000-06-01

Like all good short story anthologies should, &quot;The Best American Erotica 1999&quot; delivers a wide variety of stories within the given genre to provide readers with enough food for thought to fill many banquet  tables. Nearly all of the stories turned me on to some degree, but just as  important, some made me laugh (&quot;Is Your Husband Obsessed with On-Line  Pornography,&quot; &quot;Three Obscene Telephone Calls&quot;), some made me  want to cry (&quot;Licking Our Wounds,&quot; &quot;Doctor Fell&quot;), some  made me, well, you know (&quot;Penetration'&quot; &quot;Picking up  Daddy,&quot; &quot;The Balm that Heals&quot;). The one disappointment was  &quot;Tell Me What it Is.&quot; The writer of this story presented us with  interesting, complex characters, but the ending seemed abrupt and made no  sense. But in a book of over 20 short stories, it would be nearly  impossible to like every story. That is the beauty of a short story  anthology, though. If there's a story you don't like, just skip to the next  one. But in this case, readers of this anthology probably won't be skipping  many stories.	2000-05-27
US	53016908	RSLJ8WT6NJAVL	0679735771	92932803	American Psycho	Books	2	0	2	N	N	Bateman is one sick puppy!	As social commentary about the emptiness of soul, shallow commercialism and utter lack of morals that marked much of the 1980s (and aspects of all civilizations), this book did an ok job. Bateman's obsession with labels  and name brands, able to figure out the designers of just about every  article of clothing worn by just about every character in the novel,  certainly illustrates this shallowness. I also found it amusing no one  could remember their friends' names (not to mention which friends were  dead!). However, the torture scenes were just too disgusting to be  believed. Bateman has to be the most morally represensible anti-hero in  modern fiction. I am almost afraid to ask where Ellis got the ideas for  some of these horrible tortures and mutilations Bateman afflicts on these  hapless characters. Surely, one can find books detailing the social  wasteland of the 1980s (like &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot; for  example) without having to read descriptions that will give you nightmares  for weeks.	2000-05-21

Rudy's take on gender theology and how we as Christians can move past it are at once liberating and a little bit scary. I wholeheartedly agree with her call to return to the community of the Christian church, that our  relationships should be based around baptism, not family, and that how we  relate to God and to each other should be not be based on our gender or  sexuality. Her concept of what constitutes moral sex, though, needs to be  studied with care. To base the morality of the sex act on community needs  and hospitality invites a misread that would sanction all sorts of  irresponsible sex acts under the guise of &quot;communal sex.&quot; I don't  necessarily disagree, but I think a more thorough explanation of what  exactly this version of moral sex does and does not look like would have  been in order.	2000-05-17

Nora today would not, of course, face the lies and deceit necessary to pay for her husband's health-giving  trip. Still, though, how many wives today feel trapped by their roles as  wives and mothers, with no real outlet to discover their true selves, their  true strengths? Women may have more freedoms, but how many times, when a  mother leaves her husband and children, do we assume something is wrong  with her, that she is just being selfish, and not look at what her husband,  and society, has done to make her feel she must take this desperate step. I  wish I had read this play before I was married. My life choices may have  been drastically different. (Then again, maybe not!)	2000-05-13

I especially enjoyed the &quot;Sundered Wineskins&quot; story, which made me  think about the nature of God and worship. (Plus, that short story tied in  with a short story by the same author in the original &quot;Love in  Vein&quot; collection -- how clever!) Not all the stories were as  enjoyable; &quot;Dusting the Flowers,&quot; for example, was a turn-off and  made little sense, since we never got to see precisely what motivated the  characters. I did expect more sex, but on the other hand, the physical  sensuousness, in its broader term, was there in abundance. Overall an  enjoyable book.	2000-05-13

We never fully understand what attracts William to Sarah, and I don't think William does, either. But that  is what happens when you fall for someone; someone asks what it is you love  about this person, and you are left saying everything and nothing at the  same time. From a cold, objective standpoint, it was clear that both  William and Sarah needed to grow up before they could be in a grown-up  relationship. Perhaps if they had met five years later, they'd live happily  ever after. But that doesn't make William's heartbreak any less real, and  his reactions to the breakup, I think are realistic, for the most part.  After I finished the book, I cried, not only for the characters, but for my  own lost loves that, even after 12 happy years of marriage, still haunt my  dreams from time to time.	2000-04-27

John Brown comes across as a complex,  multidimensional person, as does his son Owen, who defies any sort of  stereotyping. What makes this book readable, despite its length, is the  detail Banks gives to his characters and their philosophies and  motivations. My only complaint is that the ending was very abrupt, as if  Owen had stopped his narration in mid-thought. Perhaps that was an  intentional device on Banks' part, given Owen's state of mind as he  completes his voluminous letter to Miss Mayo. Still, it was a little  jarring, and left me wanting maybe just another page or two to wrap up the  seeming unfinished thought.	2000-04-23

He uses words and  phrases that convey the depth of his pain, his anger, and his joys loudly  and clearly. He pulls no punches in his growing anger toward the  contradictory stance of the United Methodist church on the issue of  homosexuality, and in the spirit-filled language he uses to describe his  relationships with his family, his friends, his lover, and with God.  Although I am not a gay person, I can nonetheless appreciate and learn from  his struggle to be authentic with himself, to embrace every part of his  being, and to realize that he can and should be everything God created him  to be. It's a lesson for all of us struggling to be honest with our true  selves and worry that our true selves will not be &quot;good enough&quot;  for other people and for God. The reality, though, is God's love and grace  is all sufficient and is not withheld from any of God's children. And ALL  of us are God's children. Thank you, Dr. Rossiter, for reminding us of the  fullness of God's love!	2000-04-05

This book did an excellent job of  answering those questions. Even though I knew the ending, I still enjoyed  reading this book. My only complaints -- and they must be minor if I still  gave the book five stars -- are that the movie had a more satisfying ending  than the book did (Boone now has his war story, and he should have had the  chance to tell it in the book), and I like the title &quot;Gods and  Monsters&quot; better than &quot;Father of Frankenstein.&quot; Still, if  you liked the movie, get the book.

I'm not a big noir fan, but I picked up this book because I like urban legends and I was interested in what Baer could do with the stealing-the-kidney legend. He does not disappoint. His prose is simple,  dark, yet deceptively beautiful, and he is capable of interweaving past and  present, real and hallucinations, in a way that keeps readers guessing  without confusing them.

I figured it would be a nice diversion to read about some of the crazy adventures and mishaps that befall famous corpses after the funeral  (so to speak). In that, I was not disappointed. Murphy obviously did his  research, and he was honest enough to list various accounts when the facts  were in doubt. He also wrote with a nicely wry sense of humor befitting the  subject. However, I found the writing to lack a certain polish, as if I was  reading a third draft instead of the finished product. I found enough  awkward sentences, paragraphs with more than one subject, and other poorly  constructed phrases to dampen my enjoyment of the book somewhat. I suspect  this may not be the fault of the author so much as the editors involved in  the project, but in any case, the book suffered as a result.	2000-03-13

I love trivia books like this, and I enjoyed reading about all the little-known sexual facts out there. Especially intriguing is the section on what is still considered a crime in the United States. Who'd have  guessed, for example, that in San Francisco, of all places, it's illegal to  give and receive oral sex? That said, though, what the book painfully  lacked was citations. Where did the author get all these facts? A list of  sources at the end would have sufficed for this type of book.

That Lisa is the last to recognize the  fact that she is in love was so believable, and the struggle both she and  Elliot had with their feelings seemed very real and very human. As for  whether the marriage becomes boring or Lisa has to give up her place at the  Club, I seriously doubt that either would happen.

Of course, she wrote the book before the Monica Lewinsky scandal made us all question exactly what we  mean by having sex, but still, someone with her apparent intelligence  should realize that any intimate activity leading to orgasm is probably  sex, and that these activities, too, should not be taken lightly. Having  made such mistakes in the past, I know how it can hurt to be dumped by  someone with whom you have been intimate, even if that intimacy didn't lead  to actual intercourse. She seems to come to this realization at the end of  the book, but not before she has &quot;given herself&quot; to far too many  guys who didn't really care. This book should be read -- and carefully --  by those who want to know just where to draw the line.	1999-05-25
