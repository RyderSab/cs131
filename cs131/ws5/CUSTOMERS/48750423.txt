This time Paul takes on the case of Emiliano Ruiz, an ex-military man who now does security work. Unfortunately, Ruiz had the misfotunate to be doing security work for murder victim, Madelyn Chapman. Chapman ran a software company heavily involved with government contracts. Not only did Ruiz do security work for Chapman, but he also had an affair with her before she unceremoniously dumped him. Ruiz has a ready-made motive of revenge and jealousy. <br /> <br />The book started out promising, but quickly turned disappointing. The whole middle of the story just dragged until I found myself starting to skim...not a good sign. I've never really enjoyed government corruption stories. They tend to lend themselves to cliches and this one is no exception. I do like Paul Madriani as a character and I hope the next book has a better plotline.  <br />	2005-10-10
US	48750423	R2R8OLOTUDFMV4	0451411897	707548223	A Clean Kill	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Nothing special	I find that I am reading Leslie Glass novels for old times sake more than anything else. When I started reading them, I really loved the character of April Woo and the relationship with her Chinese family. Their scenes were so funny. In addition her relationship with her partner, Mike Sanchez had a lot of chemistry. These days Skinny Dragon Mother and Mike are barely in the novels and the plots have not been that compelling. This addition to the series is disappointing in that it does nothing to move the characters forward. The secondary cast was not likable and I would have killed them all off.	2005-10-06

Rich in local color and flavor, POISON HEART, is novel that emphasizes the character and setting over the suspense of a traditional mystery. There is no doubt who does what, and what their motives are. Instead this novel is about character interaction. If you are looking for fast-paced action or intricate plotting, this book is not for you. If you like reading about the simplicity of small-town life and undercurrents, then this novel will not disappointment because Mary Logue is a wonderful storyteller.	2005-09-28

Madden is enjoying his life as a husband, father, and farmer, but when he discovers the raped and murdered body of a young girl in a forest stream, he is keen to help out the investigation. The local authorities are fixated on a tramp as a suspect, but Madden who has a relationship with a local gypsy is not convinced. Through further investigation, a serial child-killer comes to light. Not only has he killed in England, but also on the continent.  <br /> <br />The first book, RIVER OF DARKNESS, was excellent. I really had high hopes for the second installment. I felt very let down because not only was the plot standard, but it crawled at a snail's pace. I honestly had trouble finishing it. It picked up a little at the end, but not enough to save it for me especially since there was not really clear motive to the story. On the positive side, Airth is good writer that can really evoke a sense of time. His characterizations were believable. No one, including the antagonist, was over the top. Next time I hope we get a more compelling story.  <br />	2005-09-12

When the death of a nun at a convent is connected to Matt, and the police seem eager to pin the murder on him, he knows he must help himself out of the mess his life is becoming.<br /><br />Harlen Coben is the master of twists and turns. I was riveted to the story until the very last page. Matt and Oliva are extremely sympathetic characters and you root for their well being.

The sixth member of the family, a 10-year old boy is missing with no signs of what happened to him. The search is on for him, and time is of the essence. The story takes place in 1919, after World War I.  <br /> <br />Charles Todd is fast becoming one of my favorite authors, if not my favorite author. He has written seven novels featuring Ian Rutledge and each one is better than the last. The suspense builds throughout the novel and is maintained until the end. Rutledge is a compelling protagonist fighting his own demons while fighting for justice. The cast of secondary characters is excellent. In a whodunit, there are usually one or two unlikable characters set up as red herrings, but Todd makes his characters so human and complex that it is hard to want any of them to be guilty. The novels are rich in local and period atmosphere .You do truly get a sense of time and place reading this series. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  <br />	2005-08-24

Geneva was at the library researching her ancestor former slave Charles Singleton. Charles was active in the civil rights movement, but ended up charged with theft.  The two cases seem to be linked so Rhyme and Amelia not only investigate the present day case, but also the 140-year-old Charles Singleton case. <br /> <br />There is no doubt that Lincoln Rhyme is one of the most compelling characters written in crime fiction. It is no small feat to have an quadriplegic character and actually have the scenario work. Rhyme and Amelia have great chemistry and it always a pleasure to read about them. The problem with this book is not the protagonists, but the antagonist who is held out to be some great mastermind, but comes off as anything but. The first half of the book was pretty good and moved along swiftly. The second half completely fell apart. The plot was non-compelling, plodding, and cumbersome. The motives were either non-existent or fake. There were red herring galore. I was glad when the book was over. <br /> <br />1st half --4 stars <br />2nd half-- 2 stars <br />	2005-08-19

Before Jack gets to the small Indiana town, Barr is beaten in prison and is comatose. Jack cannot fathom why Barr would ask for him because Reacher could only hurt his case with knowledge of past atrocities committed by Barr in the military The case is solid, almost too solid.  There are so many clues that lead to Barr that it looks supicious. <br /> <br />ONE SHOT is the ninth installment in the excellent Reacher series. As a character Reacher out toughs the tough guys like Robert B. Parker's, Spenser. Child's novels are always action-packed and ONE SHOT is no different. It is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat. The motive for the sniper killings was very murky for almost the whole story. The unfolding of the motive seemed rushed at the end and made little sense. Only Lee Child could make me not care about that because the rest of the book is excellent.  <br />	2005-08-15

Now, Richard's car with his body is pulled from a river and everything that Susan presumed had happened is false. Now she must find out what happened to her daughter all those years ago with the help of a wounded Delta Force Major, Jeb Bedford. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the protagonists' chemistry in the story. Sometimes the romance takes center stage over the plotline. Luckily, the plot did not suffer. The story was quite compelling even if things like medical and police ethics were non-existent. I found the story to be quite page-turning.	2005-08-09

Prosecutor Samantha Kincaid is called to the scene. Samantha finds herself at odds with the police department when it looks like some of the evidence would be inadmissible in court due to shoddy police work.  <br /> <br />The are three interwoven stories at play in this book. The first is the Percy Crenshaw murder, the second the shooting of an unarmed woman by a police officer, and the third the romantic relationship between Samantha and Detective Chuck Forbes. As Samantha's relationship with the police department grows more prickly, exponentially so does her relationship with Chuck.   <br /> <br />This is the third in the series and if you like the previous two novels, you will like this one also. This was very much a both a police and legal procedural which made it a little dry. The minutia detailing got a bit boring for me. The story had some good points and I cared enough to complete the book.  <br />	2005-07-26

The civil suit is going to lapse soon due to Chelsi's uncle's emotional inertia. Chelsi wants justice for her aunt. The case is more complicated than it seems at first.

To protect their own interests, they fled before they could be questioned. Nina's investigation is a catalyst to more murders before all is said and done.  <br /> <br />Perri O'Shaughnessy can always be counted upon to tell an interesting story with multi-faceted characters. Nina personal and professional story has evolved from the beginning of the series. At the end of every book, I always look forward to the next one to the continuation of  Nina's story.

I'm not sure if the series has run its course, but there was nothing really new or interesting in BROKEN PREY. It's a pretty standard serial killer thriller with more than the prerequisite amount of gore and violence. This book is not for the faint-of-heart. I'm pretty immune to the violence in some books, but this one had me skimming on several occasions. John Sandford fans will enjoy another entry in a beloved series, but there are better choices for new fans.	2005-06-20

The books within the series are uneven, and this one is only average, not up to the best, but certainly not the worst. The characterization was rather strange. The behaviors in the beginning of the story did not hold true throughout the book, so it almost seemed like different people. The story was somewhat suspenseful, but not very compelling. The ending left a vaguely unsatisfying feeling...everything was nicely wrapped up with a big bright bow, but no substance to the package. I did like the atmospheric feel the author created by using Hawaii as the backdrop.	2005-06-09

It is now eight-years later and the now twenty-one year old Rand Duchy calls Alex after he is  released from the detention center. Alex nver has the chance to discover what Rand really wanted to see him about. As Alex and Milo look into Rand's murder, they reinvestigate Kristal's murder. Eight years ago the case was a straight forward kidnapping/murder, but upon reinvestigation, motivations are much more complex and ugly than they seemed.  <br /> <br />To be perfectly honest it took me a long time to get into this book. I found the set-up of the story to be slow and boring. I'm not sure if is because I had trouble connecting to any of the characters or because of the way the book is plotted. Luckily the second half of the book made up for the slow first half. I would not say one of Kellerman's best works, but the second half of the book is very compelling.  <br />	2005-06-07

Seventeen years earlier, sixteen-year-old bi-racial Becky Verloren was kidnapped from her bedroom and later found dead on the wooded hillside behind her home. Initially declared a suicide until the autopsy report. The report indicated a lack of gunpowder on Becky's hands as well as signs of a recent abortion. They police lost a lot of time and clues due to their lack of investigation. Now DNA that has been reanalyzed comes up with a suspect and the case is reopened. <br /> <br />Since I am a big fan of the TV series Cold Case, I really enjoyed this eleventh edition of the Harry Bosch series. The plot was intricately plotted without being confusing. Harry and Kiz have a great dynamic as partners and it was a pleasure to have them work together again. This was not my favorite Bosch novel. It moved rather slowly at times, and the climax was rather predictable, but Connelly has a knack for keeping his readers interested.  <br />	2005-05-27

Erin is not sure about helping her ex-friend, Laura Marshall, who is accused of murder, but she feels the old ties of friendship enough to send Cliff to check out the situation. <br /> <br />This book is a spellbinding, can't put it down, page-turner with a great cast of primary and secondary characters. I loved how the author used the quirky profession of buying and selling rare books as an integral part of the mystery. I never knew book selling could be so fascinating.

Two anarchists are arrested, but a third lies dead of a gunshot wound to the head apparently shot by one of his comrades.  The two arrested anarchists vehemently deny culpability instead accusing the police of brutality.  The investigation once again leads Pitt into the workings of the sinister Inner Circle, and back into the sphere of his archenemy and bitter rival, Charles Voisey. <br /> <br />Anne Perry writes an excellent accurately depicted Victorian London series. The setting is a gritty, realistic portrayal of the times. The characters are evolving, and fully fleshed out human beings. The plot is suspenseful without being overly complicated. My one complaint is that the book is very much a continuation in a series. A first time reader would have trouble understanding who most of the people are since Anne Perry spends little or no time in introducing them.  <br />	2005-04-25

The series has an atmospheric, quaint small village vibe. McGown has a gift of characterization, writing deft credible characters instead of stereotypes.

The crime story, which involved the serial killing of \\"at-risk\\" adolescent boys, was not really a compelling narrative. I usually love Elizabeth George books, but it dragged in many parts and the first half of the book seemed like a bit of a chore to read. What really saved this book was Thomas Lynley's personal story. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say it involved quite a shock. The second half of the book picked up tremendously. Series readers will get the full emotional effect of the events.

In another storyline Sarah investigates a man in a housing project who practices medicine without a license. She seeks medical advice to trap him, but instead of arresting him, she ends up befriending him. In yet another storyline, Sarah is asked by 17 year-old Marlinchen Hennessy to find her twin brother Aidan who has not lived with the family for five years. He lived with a family friend, but has not been heard from for several weeks. Marlinchen's mother is dead and her father, a once famous author, has had a stroke. Sarah becomes a court-ordered guardian to the Marlinchen and her three brothers who live at home. As Sarah probes into the Hennessy background she stumbles on more secrets and deceit than she thought exisisted.  <br /> <br />The second novel by Jodi Compton starts a few months after her first novel THE 37TH HOUR leaves off. I highly recommend that they be read in order, which is no sacrifice since both are excellent books. Sarah is a bit of an emotional mess due to the culmination of twists in the first book. Sarah does straddle the lines of moral versus ethical boundaries within the confines of being a police detective. This book was one of the best books I have read in awhile: fast -paced, suspenseful, and very hard to put down.  <br />	2005-04-08

It keeps things interesting, but at the some time you really have to pay attention because the story can get confusing.

I've enjoyed all the Sean Drummond books mainly because he is such a smart-ass character that could be very annoying, but somehow isn't. I'm not sure how realistic the story is, I hope for our national security it is not, but it sure was a page-turner. There were a lot of twists in the novel, but the surprise ending was not that much of surprise to me. Not that it mattered because I enjoyed being right for once.  <br />	2005-03-28

Her husband died eight months earlier. She recently lost her job at the Los Vegas Police Department due a violent beating she gave to a man while under the influence of alcohol. She lost custody of her niece while in detox. Luckily the LVPD is in need of her services as psychological profiler of deviant personalities. They sign her on as a consultant to help snare a serial killer who is inspired by the work of Edgar Allen Poe. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed the Ben Kincaid series by William Bernhardt, but after a few chapters of this book, I was not sure I even wanted to finish it. The protagonist started out as one of the most unlikable of any that I have ever read. Luckily I hung in there because DARK EYE was a very engaging page-turner. Susan is indeed a complex, dark character, but for all her complexity she seemed very emotionally frail. The best part of the story is her relationship with her police chief's autistic-savant 26-year old son. I'm really looking forward to seeing that relationship develop in future. I one complaint is the torture and killing scenes were so gruesome or evoked such gruesome images that I could not read them. I skipped pages at a time. I hope I did not miss anything important.  <br />	2005-03-26

This time out the setting is London instead of Yorkshire as Banks first looks into the disappearance of his brother, and then tries to make sense of his murder. As Banks delves into the life of his brother, he realizes how little he knew him. In a intersecting storyline, a young woman is found shot to death in her car in Yorkshire. The woman has a slip of paper with Bank's address and phone number on it in her pocket.  Banks colleague (and former girlfriend), Detective Inspector Annie Cabot is called on to investigate that case. <br /> <br />Robinson has written another winner in his excellent Banks series. The novel is well paced and suspenseful without getting confusing. The characters of Annie Cabot and Banks continue to evolve slowly with each novel. Banks is rather depressed throughout this book after the fire that took all his possessions and his home at the end of PLAYING WITH FIRE. Luckily there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel for Banks. I prefer him not to be quite so melancholy. I recommend the whole series even though this a stand alone novel well worth reading.  <br />	2005-03-20

Rebus is confronted with inter-racial tension including his own prejudices.  Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke is asked to investigate the disappearance of a young woman whose sister's rape and subsequent suicide has haunted her. Her parents are frantic for her return and they call upon Siobhan to help find her. The rapist is found murdered shortly after his release from prison having served a paltry three years. In another plotline, Rebus and Siobhan are both involved in the discovery of skeletons beneath a cement floor of a newly renovated pub. <br /> <br />Rankin infuses his novels with a strong sense of the local color of Edinburgh. We have two very likable protagonists who interact well on a professional level, and have a sense of chemistry on a personal level.  The characters continue to grow with every subsequent novel. Rankin writes a first-rate procedural that is suspenseful and nicely paced. I would not say this is my favorite Rebus novel, but they are all well worth reading.  <br />	2005-03-14

The man's dying words were that he was looking for his son Elvis Cole. Elvis never knew his father and has some doubt that his mother ever knew either. He spent much of his youth trying to find his father, so Diaz's words touched a hot button. As Cole hunts for clues, a deranged killer stalks Cole with the intent of murdering him. Also in the mix of the story is bomb technician Carol Starkey's unreturned feelings for Cole, a prostitution ring, blackmail, and Cole's unresolved relationship with Lucy Chenier. <br /> <br />I've been reading Robert Crais since he started writing the Elvis Cole stories. I love the character of Elvis Cole, and the gritty, dark style to the storytelling. The whole series is excellent and this book is no exception. The story was told by alternate narrators which allowed different perspectives to the story. It really kept suspense high and the story moved along at a fast pace. I look forward to the next chapter in Elvis Cole's story. <br />	2005-03-12

The story begins in 1958 when Irene's mentor, Connor O'Connor, was an eight-year old newspaper boy at the Las Piernas News Express. Newsman Jack Corrigan takes the young Conn under his wing and begins training him in the newspaper business. One night Corrigan is almost beaten to death. That same night four members of the Ducane family disappear apparently swept off a yacht they were sailing. The infant of the younger Ducanes is kidnapped and his nursemaid is murdered.  Corrigan has a personal interest in investigating this story. He is Kathleen Ducane's godfather and he wants to know what happened to her and to her infant. Despite his tireless efforts, he was never able to solve the mystery. This mystery is interwoven into the story that takes us to when Irene Kelly first works for Conn O'Connor. More leads come to light , but it is not for another twenty years that the mystery of what happened that fateful night is resolved. <br /> <br />Jan Burke has crafted a complex,multi-layered, cohesive, suspenseful novel.. This book hooks you with the first page and does not let go.  It features a compelling cast of flesh-out characters, both likeable and real. You are drawn to them, and their story of pain and heartache. I consider this one of the best books I have read in years.	2005-03-05

Detective Superintendent Alan Markby and his fianc Meredith Mitchell have been asked to look into the source of some poison pen letters by Toby Smythe , a friend and colleague of Meredith's . Meredith and Toby have been friends for years and both work for the Foreign Office. Toby's uncle, Jeremy Jenner's second wife has been receiving hateful letters alluding to a murder trial in which she was the defendant twenty years ago. She was cleared of the charges, but it seems someone wants to embarrass her. Before Markby and Merideth's investigation has barely started, Jeremy Jenner`s daughter is found murdered made to look like the murder so many years ago. <br /> <br />Ann Granger can be counted upon to produce a really good cozy mystery. Her characters are a bit more realistic and dimensional than the traditional cozy. The plot was well constructed. The clues came at a quick enough pace to keep suspense high without it being a book that could not be put down. I look forward to the next Markby and Mitchell mystery.  <br />	2005-02-28

I look forward to his books and have not been let down yet. The current entry in the series is no exception. The plot, which revolves around Hardy's defense of his first love in a double homicide, grabs you from the first page and does not let go until the climatic ending. His characters of Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky feel like real people who are sometimes flawed, mostly complex and often admirable. Glitsky is dealing with some pretty heavy health issues with his newborn son in this story.  The characters continually evolve within the story, book to book. Hardy and Glitsky are not the same men they were in the beginning of the series. Lescroart fans will not be let down, and new readers will be reading the backlist after this book.	2005-02-24

Twenty-five years ago Catherine Gagnon was kidnapped by a pedophile and buried underground for a month. She was rescued and became known as the \\"Thanksgiving Miracle\\" in the media. That particular nightmare changed her forever. She is sexual, but not emotionally connected. <br />Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge kills Catherine's husband, Jimmy, in what he perceives as imminent danger to Catherine and her son. Jimmy is the son of a wealthy and powerful judge that hates Catherine. He begins proceedings to charge Bobby with murder, and to get custody of his grandson away from Catherine. The pedophile that kidnapped Catherine is paroled,  and people who are supportive of Catherine start dying. Catherine wants Bobby to help her, but he is not so sure that she is not guilty of setting the stage for her husband's death. <br /> <br />Lisa Gardner is skilled at portraying her characters in a realistic fashion. They have their faults and their strengths. The story was well plotted, but for some reason, I was not engaged, as I should have been. I'm not sure why.  For me, it was a good story, but not exactly a page-turner.  <br />	2005-02-21

Assistant District Attorney and sex crimes prosecutor, Alexander Cooper is determined to resolve these cases in this seventh book in the series. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the references to Edgar Allen Poe. I learned quite a bit about him that I had not known. The crime story itself felt a bit disjointed and at times dragged quite a bit. The protagonists have a good chemistry that keeps the story interesting. This was not my favorite Alexandra Cooper novel, but not the worst either.	2005-02-15

Her latest client is Rendell Price. Rendell has been on death row for fifteen years after being convicted, along with his brother, of sexual assault and murder of a nine-year old girl. After several meetings with Rendell, Teresa not only believes in Rendell's innocence, she believes that he is slow. She hopes that his mild retardation opens up an area for an appeal. After she and her team that includes her husband and stepson, she is convinced she knows who the guilty party to the murder is, and she pursues all courses of action all the way to the Supreme Court. <br /> <br />No one can accuse Richard North Patterson of sidestepping politically charged issues. Patterson gives us in-depth look into the process and machination of the legal system. The book is written with a view against the death penalty, but does gives persuasive arguments for both sides. The book at times got bogged down in legal-speak which is rather difficult for the layman to understand, but overall it was a fascinating look at the complexites of the death penalty. <br />	2005-02-07

Amanda arrives in Toronto and confronts her mother about the man she killed. Her mother just wants to plead guilty and be done with it. Amanda cannot let it go without answers to who the man was and his connection to her mother. <br /> <br />PUPPET was an intricately plotted novel. It was suspenseful and hard to put down.

The prime suspect is murdered, then another killing takes place. Soon it is evident that a serial killer is on the loose. The overworked sheriff deputizes Sean and Michelle to help him solve the killings that are piling up by the day. <br /> <br />I have waited a week to write a review of this book. It a strange book to review because I enjoyed reading it, but can't quite figure out why. I love the chemistry of the two protagonists even though there is no romantic involvement. There were a lot of characters in this story and that was a good thing because one was getting murdered almost every chapter. The plot was totally ridiculous. At the end to tie up the many loose ends, the author goes through a laundry list of items in scene that served no other purpose than to answer question that should have been answered as part of the story. It seemed so out of place that I wondered if an editor made him add that scene. I can't recommend the book, but I would love to see these characters back in a book worthy of them.  <br />	2005-01-27

There are many more deaths in the course of this novel including the two land surveyors who initially found the corpses.

His wife and task force partner, Kate Mayfield worked on the initial investigation of the explosion, but was pulled off the case. Shortly thereafter, explosion was deemed an accident.

He and Kate make an interesting and strong team. After a slightly slow start with the description of the initial investigation, the plot really takes off and becomes a real page-turner.

There are a lot of storylines, and the author skillfully intertwines them without confusing the reader.

In a concurrent storyline Benton and Lucy and working on a stalker case. As in many plots, these two storylines eventually intertwine then merge.  <br /> <br />This would be a very difficult book for a first time reader to start. The characters have been well developed over many books. Patricia Cornwell has delivered another page turning albeit confusing novel.  At the end of the book, the whole story seemed disjointed. There were several characters with storylines in separate locations. Several characters are introduced with some sense of importance and then dropped.  For example, much was made of the new Chief Medical Examiner and his feelings about Kay. The story spent several chapters on him and then he completely disappeared from the story.  I'm not sure if the book was edited to feel this choppy or if the author changed the course of the plot midstream. <br /> <br /> I'd like to rate this book higher because overall Patricia Cornwell novels are well written, engaging books with strong characterization. The weak plot was disappointing in TRACE, but on some level I did enjoy reading the book.  <br />	2004-11-08

The owner of the Angel Gate's young stepdaughter vanished three years ago, but is not the little girl who was found shot. <br /> <br />Much of this story is introspective for Richard Jury as he examines his feelings about the death of his cousin who he had really never liked in life. That part of the book was very slow moving for me and ultimately did not work. Melrose Plant, a fixture in many prior Jury books was brought into this story, but seemed to be so extraneous that it seemed ridiculous. If you a fan of Richard Jury, then I would recommend reading it, but for others the prior Jury novels are much better. This one was a bit of a chore to get through.	2004-11-02

There are many twists and turns along the way with a nice surprise ending. It is an engrossing book and was very hard to put down. <br /> <br />	2004-10-27

Their mother could not cope with the loss of her husband and increasingly turned to the bottle. The brothers literally raised themselves until one dark night six years after their father's death, when their mother's boyfriend got nasty and killed their mother.  That night their lives changed forever. Now they are adults, the older brother is incarcerated and the younger brother, Paul Wolff becomes a firefighter. Fires start to escalate in the city and they have a very similar pattern to the fires that Paul's father was investigating at the time of his death. <br />  <br />While this book can be classified as a procedural, I found it to be much more of a character study. The story is told by alternating points of view of the major characters which really allowed the reader to get to know each character, and to be absorbed into their story. Fast-paced and page-turning, this is  book is well-worth your time.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-15

He is cleared fairly early in the game, but not before he becomes immersed in the investigation himself.   <br /> <br />Overall, the Kevein Kearney series is a good one. The primary cast of characters is fully realized, likeable, and sympathetic. The problem in this book is that the plot and characters contained within are not exciting or interesting to keep your attention. I found myself often putting the book down. Michael McGarritty is a good writer, but all good writers can have a misstep.  <br />	2004-10-04

In the third outing of the series, Harry asks Marty to take on the murder defense of his law school lover of twenty -five years ago.  <br /> <br />One of Rose Connors strengths is characterization. They are real in a fascinating larger than life kind of way. It is fun to read about them. The weakness in this book was the plot. It was not suspenseful at all and really made the book drag through three-quarters of the book. I really wanted to like it, but in the end it just seemed boring.  <br />	2004-09-30

This story revolves around Lucas Jordan who is a profiler whose special skill is locating missing people. Lucas has come to Clayton County, North Carolina to search for a serial killer that has kidnapped and killed his victims after receiving the ransom for the past two years. Psychic Samantha Burke, Lucas's past lover, is working the carnival nearby. Despite the skepticism of the police, Samantha becomes instrumental in hunting down this sadistic killer before he kills again. <br /> <br />All the books in the Noah Bishop story revolve around the paranormal so you pretty much have to suspend reality to enjoy the story. The book is a quick read and suspenseful to a point. It's a little hard to believe how quickly things are wrapped up in the end after the characters being clueless (despite paranormal abilities) for three-quarters of the story. The transition from scene to scene was not smooth at all. You are reading one scene one page and the next it something totally different. I actually looked down at the page numbers to make sure I did not miss any. It was rather jarring. This was not the best in her series, but not terrible either.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-28

As the trial goes on, memories start to come back to Carol or Carrie as she likes to be called, to cumulate in a dramatic climax. <br /> <br />The start of the story was extremely fast-paced and really drew the reader right into the story. An intriguing, realistic primary and secondary cast made this book a pleasure to read. The middle of the story dragged a little as a courtroom set thriller sometimes does.  Not every witness is fascinating or riveting. As the story started to unfold the pace picked up once again. There were quite a few red herrings, but the plot was not overly complex and it was not too hard to figure out the culprit. <br />	2004-09-27

Indelible delves into Jeffrey and Sara's past, their early relationship and especially about Jeffrey's youth in Sylacuga, Alabama.  <br /> <br />The story interweaves past and present. The book opens in the present with a hostage situation in the Grant County police station. Two men enter the police station, killing an officer, wounding others, and terrorizing a group of children visiting the station. One of the wounded is Jeffrey Tolliver. The men take hostages including Sara Linton who had been visiting Jeffrey. <br /> <br />The backstory moves to Jeffrey's hometown. He wants Sara to see who he really is and the only way for him to really do that is to have her see how he grew up. She meets his old friends and learns more than she really wants to. While there, one of Jeffrey's boyhood friend's is involved in a shooting, but his accounting of it does not square with the evidence.  Robert ends up confessing to the shooting, but Jeffrey does not believe him. He searches for evidence to clear his friend and stumbles upon a body from a long ago murder. Sara and Jeffrey's relationship is tested to the limit when old secrets are exposed. <br /> <br />Karin Slaughter writes a really excellent series with fully drawn realistic, flawed characters. Her books are the melding of the best of plot-driven and character-driven stories. I was riveted to the very last page. I highly recommend the whole series, but it is not necessary to read the previous books to enjoy this book because it is sort of a prequel to others.  <br />	2004-09-24

The boater is out there and wants to finish the job he started. Jane seeks help from her estranged sister Stacy in clearing her husband and finding her tormentor. <br /> <br />This is the first book by Erica Spindler that I have read. I really enjoyed it. It was very suspenseful and quick reading. I liked that the story flowed well without too many red herrings trying to lead you down false paths. The characterization was very good. A surprise twist at the end made this a worthwhile read. <br /> <br />	2004-09-19

It opens with Miles Van Meter promoting his true-crime book that recounts his twin sister's attack by a serial killer that left her in coma, and of the home invasion in which teenager, Ashley Spencer's father was killed. The story moves seamlessly between present day and past events throughout the book in one of the most complex plots I have read in awhile. The plot offers many twists and keeps up a fast pace. It is a suspenseful book and hard to put down. If you are a hardcore mystery reader then it was not really that hard to figure out where Margolin was going with the story. I figured out who the culprit was within the first quarter of the book, but still enjoyed following the different paths that Margolin was leading the readers. The crimes themselves are pretty graphic so beware if you are faint-of-heart.	2004-09-15

Nina's role in the case becomes bigger and more involved when Klaus is seemingly unprepared to handle the complex and at times bizarre case. <br /> <br />This book jumped right in to the courtroom with barely any set up of the case. We learn a lot of the facts from a courtroom perspective. Overall, it made the story seem disjointed and not suspenseful. As characters were introduced, it was confusing because we really did not know what was going on. I muddled through the book, but as I was reading along, I really felt I was wasting precious time. Don't waste yours. <br />	2004-09-12

It is helpful to have read some of the previous books because the relationship that is established between Jude and Carole in previous books is barely touch upon in this one.  In fact, I felt Carole came off as extremely unlikable in this book. The reason Jude takes to investigating the supposed crime is rather farfetched. It is a pretty standard whodunit.

There they meet a mysterious old man who leaves them a cryptic message in an old fedora filled with snow. The next morning the old man is found frozen to death in a snowbank. When Alex goes to the old man's funeral, his relatives beat the bloody daylights out of him. Natalie's father was murdered in Soo fifteen years earlier and it is not too long before the incidents are tied together. <br /> <br />What sets Steve Hamilton's books apart from other in the genre is the atmospheric setting of the books. I actually felt cold in ninety-degree heat while reading this book. It is wonderfully descriptive and I could really feel the winter of northern Michigan. In this installment, the romance of Natalie and Alex is an integral part to the mystery. As a result, the mystery suffers somewhat as it never rises to the level of suspense I have come to expect from Steve Hamilton. Even though I would not consider this the best book of the series plot-wise, it is still a fine addition to the evolution of the characterization of Alex McKnight.	2004-09-06

In pursuing her own past she stumbles upon a serial killing spree that spanned decades.<br /><br />BODY DOUBLE has all the ingredients for a top-notch thriller. It has both beautifully maintained suspense that increases until the very end and excellent characterization. This was a real page-turner so allow enough time to read it without having to put it down too often. Several characters are back from previous books in minor or secondary roles which offers nice continuity to those familiar with Gerritsen's backlist without overwhelming the book with characters that we never get to know in the current story.  Tess Gerritson's books are often not for the faint of heart and this one is no exception. The autopsy scenes are pretty graphic. This is one of the best books I have read in quite awhile.	2004-08-31

Kinsey basically sucks at romance making it a plot point does not work. The only thing that saves this book somewhat are some interesting characters, eigthy-six year old Henry, Kinsey's landlord, and Reba, a woman that Kinsey is hired to essentially baby-sit for her first few days out of jail. Reba initally took the fall for the money-laundry, but she's been burned and now is keen on revenge. I wouldn't mind if she made a return in a future novel as Kinsey's pal and/or helper.

Protagonist Diana Spaulding is a widow who must support herself. There are not many opportunities open to women in 1888. Diana is given a job to write for the Independent Intelligence by a brother of a friend. Her hopes are to be a serious journalist, but editor Horatio Foxe has the idea that scandal and gossip is the ticket to higher newspaper sales. Her new assignment is to dig up dirt on horror author Damon Bathory. Two female journalists have murdered and Bathory seems like a plausible suspect. As Diana launches her investigation into Bathory's life, she is inexplicably drawn to the man which is a problem if he is a possible murderer.  <br /> <br />Kathy Lynn Emerson has created two extremely likable characters with a lot of chemistry together. The set up of the characters and story were very compelling. The early part of the story was a real page-turner. The book started to drag a bit in the middle especially with the introduction of the theater troupe characters. There was a bit too much going on that extraneous to the story. This was a very promising debut of a new series that looks to be as good as the DOWN UNDER series.  <br />	2004-08-24

She escapes the killer by cutting him with a knife, \\"finds\\" $50,000 on the dead Russian and makes plans to turn her life around. He calls Lucas Davenport who was featured in a news story to describe the killing. This will lead Lucas on a chase that involves an inactive Russian spy cell dating back to the Cold War.  <br /> <br />HIDDEN PREY is by no means the best in the excellent Lucas Davenport series, but even a lesser work by John Sandford is still much better than other books in the genre. This book was a little confusing with its vast cast of secondary characters. I felt at times that a pictorial of a family tree would have been in order. Lucas continues to evolve as a character and his interaction with his wife Weather was entertaining. I loved one of the early scenes in which Weather drives her car through the garage door. It was very funny and a good contrast to the dark tone that characterizes the story. I preferred when Lucas was hunting down pyscho serial killers instead of plots of espionage with international consequences. On the plus side the plot moved along at a fairly quick pace keeping the reader interested and invested in the story.  <br />	2004-08-13

Powerful people do not want Mars to succeed at this investigation, but he keeps digging and at the end of it all, he ends up putting people he cares about at risk.  <br /> <br />ALONE AT NIGHT is the fourth book in the Mars Bahr series. Mars evolves more with each story which are as good as character studies as they are mysteries. As for this one, I enjoyed it even though I knew who the culprit was so soon as a certain political party affiliation was mentioned.

Cavanaugh and Jamie are well-drawn sympathetic characters that you can really care about.  <br />David Morrell seems to fly a bit under the radar, but to me he is one of the best in his genre. If you are a first time reader, Morrell has a wonderful backlist of books.  I would rank this one as one of his best. <br />Highly recommended.  <br />	2004-08-01

There was hardly any time spent on any of the details of the secondary characters brought up in past books that made it a little hard to follow.

Hewson has woven an intense, complex plot that takes us on a realistic journey into the life of abuse and co-dependency. This was an intriguing debut for the protagonist of Nic Costa.

Bailey receives a phone call from Ashley Hanes, a fellow bridesmaid in Bailey's former college roommate's wedding.  Ashley is very disturbed about the deaths of two of the other bridesmaids. She fears she is next. Bailey feels it is just coincidence until Ashley also turns up dead in a freakish accident. Bailey starts investigating the deaths. She is being stalked and her car is run of the road.  Finding out who is behind the deaths becomes a life and death situation for Bailey.<br />As editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, Kate White, knows the world in which her books are set. Her characters are a too bit one-dimensional to be intriguing or even believable. The plot was a little short on reality too. What police department would really discount the deaths of three bridesmaids as coincidence. Bailey is a feisty character and the book is a light, easy read. It's not a bad book, but just don't expect too much out of it.	2004-06-10

She is still clean and sober after years of hard living. She gets a phone call from her adopted daughter's aunt. Lisa Slokum has taken off from the witness relocation program with her daughters, Charlotte and Jill. Lisa calls Munch desperate for help; Charlotte has gone missing. No one knows if she has run away or if something more evil has happened to her. Munch decides to help her daughter's dysfunctional family. As she starts to investigate Charlotte's life, she comes upon a stash of stolen goods in her room. Her search for Charlotte leads Munch into trouble, but due to her early life on the street, it is not anything she can't handle. <br />Munch is not quite as edgy as she was in earlier novels. Being a mother to Asia has softened her considerably not to speak of being \\"in love\\". Even a not-so-edgy Munch makes for a nice change from the run-of-the-mill type heroines in most detective novels.  She is a very likable and admirable character. Barabara Seranella's books are so character driven that the strength or weaknesses of any given plot seems secondary. I enjoyed reading UNWILLING ACCOMPLICE and look forward to the next in the series.	2004-06-07

There is no seemingly plausible explanation why these salt-of-the-earth elderly people were being murdered. Clues lead to an international link that threatens to unravel a lifetime of secrets.<br />I highly anticipated another page-turning suspenseful thriller after MONKEEWRENCH, which was one of my favorite books last year. The setup of the story started off well enough because the characters were engaging and the premise seemed interesting, but once the plotline was revealed the story went into cliché-ridden, been there-done that territory.  It was a real letdown. The ending to the mystery is a little too predictable. I figured out who the culprit was without even trying. The best part of the book was the interaction between Grace McBride from MONKEEWRENCH and Leo Mazozzi. I hope they are forefront in the next book and that the next book has a better storyline.	2004-06-03

What makes this book unique in the series is that it is a prequel. It is New Year's Day 1990 when Jack Reacher, an Army MP stationed in Fort Bird, NC, gets a call about a two-star general found in a sleazy hotel dead of a heart attack in a potentially comprising position. Missing from the scene is the briefcase that contained an outline of a meeting with the army's elite. Reacher, assisted an ambitious lieutenant MP drive four hours to break the news to the general's widow, only to find her murdered. The bodies really start piling up when a gay Delta Force soldier is found dead. Reacher's investigation is hindered when his commanding officer is mysteriously reposted and is replaced by an officer with an agenda. That agenda is to make sure Reacher does not solve the crimes.<br />Not only is this an intricate and compelling military mystery, but we finally get more insight into Reacher's personal story. His brother and mother have some pivotal scenes that were very touching. The good part is that if you never read any of the Reacher books, this is not a bad one with which to start. If I had a complaint about the book is that it started to drag a bit in the middle of the book. There are such a number of different characters that I started to feel bogged down in trying to remember them all.	2004-06-01

Thought to be dead, we now find out that Robert Backus AKA The Poet is alive. Rachel Walling is the one credited with not only shooting The Poet, but also with major screw-ups in the case was her banished to the North Dakota office. She sees her chance to get back into the FBI's good graces when she called back into the new manhunt for Backus.<br />Former LAPD detective, Harry Bosch, is asked by the widow of Terry McCaleb (protagonist in BLOODWORK) to look into her husband's death.  Backus emerges as the prime suspect in Bosch's case. Bosch and Walling reluctantly decide the work together when their cases intersect. <br />Connelly successfully intertwines the plots of the two earlier works into a suspenseful and gripping new thriller. I would recommend reading THE POET first since many of the characters are from that book. Characters from BLOODWORK are less integrated into this story so it is not really essential to know that story before the current one. We are also shown another side to Bosch's personality while he copes with being a father to a child he barely knows. Michael Connelly's characters continue to evolve with each installment of the series.	2004-05-28

This time out Anne Perry takes Monk to the river and docks that is out of his comfort zone as an investigator. He has bills to pay and is happy to get any kind of work. Clement Louvain wants Monk to investigate the theft of a cargo of ivory from one of Louvain's schooners. .Louvain does not want the theft reported to the River Police. Monk's wife, Hester, runs a clinic for desperately ill women of the street who have no other place to go. Louvain brings an ill woman who came off of one of his ships to Hester. After the woman is found dead, Hester realizes that she had the Black Plague. The plague had wiped out half the population of England two centuries before. If anyone knew, mass panic who ensue; the clinic and its inhabitants would likely be burned down. The clinic must be locked down and no one must be allowed to escape from inside. Monk must answer the question of why Louvain would bring the woman to Hester. <br />Anne Perry writes both the Thomas Pitt series and the William Monk series. When I am reading one or the other series, it is always my favorite at the time. Anne Perry has an uncanny knack of painting the scenes of her stories so vividly that you are transported back in time. She captures the essence and the flavor of the time period.  <br />This book had at first two seemingly different storylines: the stolen ivory and the plague. I found the scenes with the clinic: the difficulty in raising funds for a clinic for fallen women, the struggle in running it, the characters associated with it, and the dealing with the plague the more intriguing storyline. It was not until the storylines merged into one that I started to enjoy the story involving the shipyards. I think it was all a little too gritty for my taste. The relationship between Monk and Hester has evolved since the early books, and even later ones that involved their courtship. You always knew they were close and had a special bond, but this time you really felt it even though they had very few scenes together. Anyone who has never read the Monk series should go back and read them in order. It would be worth it because Anne Perry is an excellent writer who always has good, suspenseful plots.	2004-05-22

The fact that a metal spike, along with a gunshot wound, impaled the woman indicates more than a routine killing. The woman remains unidentified, but the young man turns out to have had a personality change due to a recent car accident. He was seeing noted celebrity psychologist, Dr. Mary Lou Koppel, for his problems. Through the investigation, another similarly murdered patient of Dr. Koppel's comes to light. Before long, Dr. Koppel herself is found murdered. The killings seem to be linked; and Alex and Milo work to find what how.<br />I usually love the Alex Delaware series and this one started out well enough, but about half way through the book, it turned deadly dull. The characters were not likable and I could just not care what happened to any of them. It was bad enough that the plot was uninteresting, but it turned ridiculous as well. Alex Delaware's personal story was hardly explored at all. First time Alex Delaware readers will be at a loss to know anything about his backstory even though his girlfriend and ex-girlfriend both make an appearance in the story. <br />First half of the book was perhaps 4 stars and the second half 2 stars for an average of 3 even though it pains me to rate one of my favorite authors so low.	2004-05-14

Major Talbot revealed that he was gay to Colonel Kelly, but after Colonel Kelly reported him and brought him up on charges, Talbot denied it. Talbot's powerful uncle, Congressman Harris, circumvented what could have been blown up into a full-blown scandal. Unable to prove his charges, Kelly was conveniently reassigned out of the country. Now Talbot is dead and Kelly is back in the country and a prime suspect. The further along in their investigation Martin and Amanda get,the more complicated it gets and the more people end up dead. <br />He and Major Gardner have many times worked investigations together, but this time proves awkward for them. Martin has lost his wife Nicole five years earlier and is raising his 13-year old daaugher. He and Amanda have had a romantic relationship, but Amanda decided to move on when Martin was not ready to let go of his deceased wife. Now Amanda is engaged and Martin realizes that he loves her. The dynamic in their relationship coupled with an interesting plot makes for a very good story.<br />Patrick Davis does know how to tell an interesting story. It was an intricately woven plot that examines the military \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy along with some religious/homosexual behavior/guilt issues. The one thing that annoyed me though, was a plot device that Mr. Davis used to keep the reader from knowing some pertinent details of the story. It was almost like the characters were whispering behind your back. Once or twice would have been okay, but it happened time and time again. There had to be a better way to move the story along with the obvious one character telling another character something, but leaving the reader in the dark.	2004-05-09

Boldt is somewhat of a legend in the SPD. He has the highest case clearance per average in the history in the Seattle Police Department. The book opens when he is called to a scene where friend and fellow officer is drugged and beaten on a stakeout of a trailer. Missing from the scene is David Hayes, the subject of the stakeout. Six years earlier David Hayes worked as technical computer support in the same bank where Lou's wife, Liz was an officer. During a dark time in the Boldt marriage, Liz had an affair with David Hayes and it almost destroyed the Boldt marriage. After the affair was over Hayes embezzled seventeen million dollars from the bank. He was caught, but the money was never recovered. Several parties are interested in retrieving the money now that Hayes is released from jail including the bank, police, and the original owners of the money, the Russian mob. David is on the run and he contacts Liz to help him get the money, which has been in limbo since his arrest. He is afraid for his life if he does not get the money back to the mob he stole it from. Liz is only one of few that has access to the codes to transfer the money. Events escalate until both the Boldt's marriage and their children are threatened. Boldt is put into the position of having to protect his family over the interests of the police department.<br />From the very first page, the reader is drawn into this story. It is an extremely well plotted thriller that has the suspense building throughout the whole story until the very end. As good as the story is there is more at play here than just another good thriller which many books can claim to be. Where Pearson excels is at the finely tuned drawing of his characters as human beings, their frailties and their proclivity for secrets that come back to haunt them. The scenes between the Boldts are fraught with anger, hurt, tension and love as they try to get past wounds that could unravel their marriage. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.	2004-05-05

She used the power she had to in selfish and destructive ways. She ended up leaving Parrrish, Mississippi, but not before throwing over her boyfriend, cutting off her girlfriends, ruining a teacher's reputation, and making her illegitimate sister's life a living hell. Now Sugar Beth has been through three husbands and any money she ever had. She comes back to Parrish and struggles to overcome her past reputation and to rectify old mistakes.<br />I'm generally not a huge fan of romance novels, but this one hooked me from the first page. I loved all the characters especially Sugar Beth. There is something very appealing about a bad girl gone good. There was good chemistry between the female and male lead characters plus a very good secondary cast of characters. The plot was standard romance fare, but the writing was good and the characterization makes a five star romance novel.	2004-04-18

As Kerry was running out of the house to get help, an unknown man hit her in the head with a metallic object. She was in a coma for two years and when she awoke she possessed a psychic talent which is triggered by fire.<br />Brad Silver is also with psychic abilities.

Brad is after the man who created Firestorm, a method of spontaneous combustion, the same man who killed his brother and sister-in-law. Brad needs Kerry's psychic ability to sense where and when fires will happen to catch this psychopath. <br />I usually don't like books of paranormal nature, but I was really drawn into this story. While the plot is not realistic, it is suspenseful. The characters have rather unique traits and are very likable. If you like your thrillers of a more gritty and realistic nature then this book is not for you. If you don't mind some unbelievable plot twists, and a bit of romantic suspense, then you will like this installment from Iris Johansen.	2004-04-12

It seems that the petty criminal that has been stalking his colleague Siobhan Clarke has been found burnt to death in his home. Rebus is known to be protective of the people he cares about so that his hands are burned is suspicious. Despite his possible culpability, he is called into a case involving a horrific shooting at a private school. Two seventeen-year olds are dead along with the gunman, an ex-Army loner. Being ex-military himself, Rebus becomes fascinated with the case.<br />Ian Rankin writes some of the best crime fiction around. His stories are realistic and his character portrayals emphasize much of the darker side of human nature. Rebus himself is not really a very likable character, but he seems very real. While this is not my favorite Rebus novel, the story does hook you in and does not let go until the last page. Rankin can always be counted on to tell a fascinating tale.	2004-03-30

Sheriff's Detective Sarah Pribek comes home one morning from a trip to find her husband of two months, Michael Shiloh, gone. She did not think too much of it since he was starting his FBI training at Quantico. Only when the FBI calls to ask why he did not show up and Sarah finds his packed duffel bag under the bed does she realize that he is really missing. Sarah usually specializes in missing person cases so she puts her skills to personal use. Much of the story is told in flashback where we learn of Michael's background, the case that brought Michael and Sarah together and of their early courtship. Intertwined into the story is also another plot point of Sarah's partner, Genevieve, who is on compassionate leave after the murder of her daughter. The characters were well developed and interesting. The story really kept me reading. The ending was weak and not in keeping with the rest of the book, but it did spoil my enjoyment of the overall story. I will look forward to the next book in this series.	2004-03-25

The most controversial piece she had written recently was an obituary with seemingly wrong facts in it. There are several deaths that seem related and Justin works to solve the puzzle.<br />The protagonists in this book were very well developed and engaging.  The plot is somewhat complicated, but very suspenseful. It made for a page-turning book after a few slow beginning chapters that set up the story. I liked that though there were a lot of characters and a more complicated plot than a standard whodunit, it was still easy to follow. The ending was a bit of a letdown so I can only give APHRODITE an qualified recommendation. It is still one of the better thrillers I have read lately.	2004-03-23

She thinks her husband may be a serial killer and wants Alan to help report him to the police. Alan's good friend, police detective Sam Purdy suffers from a mild heart attack early in the story and is not an official factor in the case. This tends to keep Alan more on the sidelines of the investigation than in earlier stories in the series. Sam does take an interest in Gibbs and starts to investigate when it is reported that Sterling may have drowned. His investigation leads to some startling revelations.<br />While this is not the best book in series, it is still an engaging novel. This can be read as a stand alone novel, but one of the strengths of this series is the ongoing development in the personal stories of all the major characters. The plot itself was a bit simplistic and somewhat contrived. The surprise ending was not really a surprise to me so that was disappointing. The story did draw me in and it was a fairly quick read. I would recommend first time Stephen White readers to start with one of his earlier works since this is not the best of a very good series.	2004-03-22

After making a payment, the demands still do not stop so Wilson wants Carlotta to find the blackmailer and reclaim the love letters he had written to the student. The more Carlotta digs into the case the more complicated it becomes including another suspicious death. <br />This is the tenth in the Carlotta Carlyle series. Linda Barnes does a good job of telling enough of Carlotta backstory to make this book totally stand on its own. I enjoyed the tall, red-haired, independent, strong, stubborn, and oddly vulnerable character of Carlotta. The story really grabbed me from the first page. It seemed to drag a bit in the middle, but really had a suspenseful ending with an unexpected twist. There was a nice balance between Carlotta personal story and the case she was working on. The plot was not overly complicated and easy to follow. Linda Barnes fans won't be disappointed.	2004-03-08

A postmistress is found hanged in her room and a vacationer comes to Lochdubh with the sole purpose of seducing him. He does have his hands full these days.<br />I consider the Hamish McBeth series the better of the two series that M.C. Beaton writes. The characters really make the stories endearing and fun. That Hamish ever solves any case always seems like sheer fluke, but you are always rooting for him. The plots are always rather straightforward and not too complicated and it makes for a quick read.

She was in the process of selling her business. Some think she ran away with her much younger painter boyfriend until her body was found in the effluent tank at the plant. Her boyfriend is prime suspect until his body is found dead of an apparent suicide. It's not long before his death is classifed as a murder. In a parallel story, Ruby's daughter Amy is pregnant and is not disclosing the baby's father. <br />The China Bayles series has always been a bit uneven. Some of the books are really good and some are very boring. I thought this was one of the better books in the series. The story really flowed and kept a good pace. Set in Texas Hill Country, Albert gives you nice sense of the rural aspect of the countryside outside of Austin. One of the best parts of the China Bayles books are the herbal facts and recipes included with the actual story. I have almost as much fun reading these as trying to figure out whodunit.	2004-02-22

Things are never quite that simple especially in a community where bed hopping is a favorite pastime. Mitch is disheartened with his friends when truly ugly secrets surface.<br />David Handler has created a unique duo as protagonists for his series. It's not often we get a slightly overweight Jewish average joe kind of a guy hooked up with a exotic beauty who likes to rescue cats and create art as much as she likes to solve crime. This is the third in the series; the previous two are THE HOT PINK FARMHOUSE and THE COLD BLUE BLOOD. Each is atmospheric giving you a nice sense of a tiny seaside village. The plots are well crafted. I would recommend the whole series if you want easy readable books. They are a pretty fast read so you don't need a lot of time commitment. The one fault with THE BRIGHT SILVER STAR is that the secondary cast for the most part is not likable.  I didn't care too much who ended up the culprit-all the characters were sort of slimy.	2004-02-15

It was complex, but very straightforward. Robinson does not rely on misdirection to create suspense, but rather a slow build-up of facts that rush the reader through a roaring crescendo toward the climax. There are a few loose ends that do not deter from the overall enjoyment of this novel. hopefully, some of the points will be addressed in the next Banks installment.

One victim was a painter who felt his art was unappreciated and the other a young sexually abused girl who was hooked on drugs. Chief Inspector Alan Banks is summoned to investigate the crime. It is not long before another fire breaks out in a remote trailer. There seems to be a serial arsonist on the loose. Secrets and lies are uncovered as Banks and his partner D.I. Annie Cabot work toward discovering the truth.<br />This story was extremely fast moving and hard to put down. Peter Robinson has created a brilliant plot for PLAYING WITH FIRE. It was complex, but very straightforward. Robinson does not rely on misdirection to create suspense, but rather a slow build-up of facts that rush the reader through a roaring crescendo toward the climax. There are a few loose ends that do not deter from the overall enjoyment of this novel. hopefully, some of the points will be addressed in the next Banks installment. This is a first rate British police procedural and a must read for anyone who appreciates quality.	2004-02-12

A new associate to the firm, Amy Wu, is grieving over the recent loss of her father. She brings the firm a high-profile case in which Andrew Barlett, the seventeen-year-old son of a prominent family is charged with the murder of his pregnant girlfriend and drama coach. Wu tries to keep Andrew in juvenile court where his maximum sentence is eight years as opposed to adult court where it would be life without parole. At first Wu is convinced that Andrew is quilty and pushes him to accept the plea bargain offered by the D.A. in which is admits to his guilt in order to stay in the juvenile system. The problem is he adamantly protests his innocence despite all the evidence against him. With the firm's reputation is on the line, Dismas agrees to sit second chair at the trial.<br />John Lescroart writes one of the best legal thriller series if not the best. His characters are fully realized, emotionally complex people that grow with each book. If you have never read this series, it is not a bad idea to start from the beginning. It would be worth it because most of the books in the series are excellent.<br />Lescroart is able to draw on the reader's emotions regarding his characters. I strongly disliked the Wu character in the beginning of the story. She had this boy's life in her hands and she was just trying to ramrod him through the system because she thought he was guilty. She was busy feeling sorry for herself: drinking, picking up men, overall irresponsible behavior. She was just not a very sympathetic character. In the course of the story, you really get to see her evolution. By the end you can understand why she was acting the way she did and even sympathize with her.    <br />Abe Glitsky, another mainstay from the series is also present in a parallel storyline. There is not quite as much interaction between Dismas and Abe this time out, but the storylinesdo tie together in the end. <br />John Lescroart fans will enjoy this entry in the series and new readers will become fans.	2004-02-09

Jack goes along with Roxanne when she first goes to interview the parents, David and Maddie Connelly.

When young woman that they met at the Connelly's is later found murdered, Jack tries to track down the murderer. It's not an easy job and the deeper he digs the more question arise. He has a long list of suspects including David and Maddie. <br />Boyle populates his book with well-drawn, quirky characters highlighted with an excellent supporting cast. The plot is extremely well paced with the suspense building evenly throughout the book. Boyle hooks the reader in and does not let go until the last page.	2004-02-05

He and his wife are on an important dig in Central America. Looting is a big problem at the site. Walter and Jocelyn are ambushed on their way back to go home. When the attack is over, artifacts are taken and Jocelyn is dead.  After the funeral Walter leaves Wisconsin for LA and is virtually cut-off from his three grown sons. The sons find their father's behavior very strange and work together to try to uncover the truth of what happened in Central America. The deeper they delve in to the strange financial transactions they uncover, the more confused they become. <br />I have enjoyed J.F. Freedman books in the past, but found too many contrived plot points in this book. Once the sons started unraveling the mystery, things just fell into place much too easily. Everyone they talked to was very forthcoming with information with barely any questions asked. It was as unrealistic as it was unconvincing. The ending had a twist, but again suffered in its predictability.  I found myself flipping pages just to move the story forward. I wanted to like the book, but at the end it was not really worth the time it took to read it.	2004-02-02

It isn't, except that through her humorous take on life you get to know more about her as a person. She covers topics like why do people talk too much, advancements in technology, to why being in prison wouldn't be so bad. The book is very much in character with the Ellen we see on television-warm, wry, self-deprecating, a person with a wide-eyed view of the world. If you are a fairly quick reader it won't take much more than two hours to read. And a very pleasant two hours it was.	2004-02-02

Still grieving, a variety of strangers show up in her life all claiming in one form or other the wrongdoing Francis Hatton has done to them. Francesca cannot reconcile what these strangers say to the loving memories of her grandfather. The most series of the charges is from a dying ex-soldier, Richard Leighton, who is convinced that Francis Hatton kidnapped/murdered his mother, Victoria Leighton. He is convinced that she would never have left her then eight-year-old son. Francesca wants to clear her grandfather's name so she begins an investigation to seek the truth.<br />THE MURDER STONE is a richly nuanced and multi-layered family story. Francesca's quest for the truth leads the reader through a narrative that becomes more compelling with each chapter. Interspersed in the story are intriguing flashbacks told by her five now dead cousins. These flashbacks move the story along and provide some insight into the times and mind of Francesca's grandfather. I enjoyed the book as I do all the Charles Todd books. I found the characters both interesting and compelling. The climax has a good twist that I was not expecting. Even though the action was not the fast-paced blood and gore variety, this book had me turning the pages until the end.	2004-01-28

I consider Mary one of the best writers in her genre. Her stories are character driven rather than plot driven. I alternated read one of the Christmas stories with other books so I would no be overwhelmed with all the Christmas good cheer. I worked out nicely. All the stories are good, but the first and only original story in the book is the best one. Fans of Mary Balogh won't be disappointed and new fans will be in for a treat.	2004-01-26

It's not an adventure that she particularly wants. She had given up spying for her half-sister Queen Elizabeth or so she thought. She is sucked back into the antics of court when there is some trouble with Ursula's ward, Penelope Mason. Pen, one of Elizabeth's ladies-in-waiting has fallen in love with a married man. Elizabeth is not amused. Elizabeth uses this to have Ursula to go visit Mary Queen of Scots at the northern castle where she is held captive. Ursula does not want to accept her assignment, but much to her surprise her husband Hugh urges her too. She, her daughter Meg, and her ward set out on their journey north. Things do not turn out well when Meg is kidnapped and one of her men is killed. This is the first of mishaps and misadventures that the group faces.<br />Fiona Buckley skillfully interweaves historical fact and fiction. Ursula Stannard is portrayed as a strong independent woman who can hold her own with any man. Most of the characters are richly drawn and the setting gives you a real sense of time and place.  The story line was interesting and kept you reading. Overall, this entry is an entertaining addition to a well-received series.	2004-01-26

The museum is mostly known for its Murder Room. A room depicting notorious crimes of the era. The deaths being investigated are similar to those depicted in The Murder Room. Dagliesh must determine if these are merely copycat killings or if there is a darker more personal motive at play.<br /> James has populated THE MURDER ROOM with interesting and quirky characters. We have a trio of siblings who are at odds on whether to continue the museum when the lease is up. There is also the loyal secretary with no life outside her work, a lonely housekeeper who has taken a young troubled gay man under her wing, a curator with military ties and a volunteer who in her youth was a spy.<br />Dagliesh's love life is also moving forward in this book even though not too many pages are devoted to it. It was nice to see his personal progession.<br />P.D. James can be counted on to give you interesting characters and a superbly written intricate plot. She does not fail here. The one weakness in the book is that the action does not start until well after 100 pages.Quite frankly the set up was boring and my mind started wandering several times. Once the first killing takes place, the pace picks up considerably and the book then becomes a page-turner. I love the Adam Dagliesh series and while I do not consider this the best book of the series, I was not really disappointed. The last ¾ of the book made up for the rather slow start. Overall, it was a very enjoyable read.	2004-01-20

She gets a job with a childhood friend's firm, a firm she thought was legitimate. She thought wrong.

There is a serial killer loose stalking victims resembling Christy. Enter FBI agent Luke Rand. He has Christy surveillance because of her connection to the DePalma crime family. <br />As with most novels of this genre, you have to suspend belief to enjoy the book. Most the plot is pretty farfetched.  The things that make it enjoyable are the feisty primary characters and their chemistry. The action is fairly fast-paced so the story moves along.	2004-01-13

Dr. Carrier is emotionally traumatized by the death of his girlfriend. She is brutally murdered and Jeremy becomes a prime suspect in her death. He is the staff psychologist at City Central Hospital. There he gets drawn into a unexpected and rather bizarre friendship with pathologist Dr. Arthur Chess. More murders ensue with the police focusing on Jeremy. Dr. Chess slips away supposedly to go on vacation. He leaves Jeremy what amounts to pieces of a puzzle that will help solve the spate of recent killings and to help clear Jeremy of suspicion.<br />I always look forward to Jonathan Kellerman novels. The Alex Delaware series is one of my favorites. I had really high expectations for this book. The first half of the book really dragged. I never connected to any of the characters. The plot was undeveloped. Luckily the second half of the book got more interesting and a bit more suspenseful. Once Jeremy started solving the puzzle Dr. Chess was sending him, the plot really improved and Kellerman's skills were once again evident. The last quarter of the book was a page-turner, unfortunately I expected so much more.<br />First ½ of book: 1 star<br />Third ¼ or book: 3 stars<br />Fourth ¼ of book: 5 stars	2004-01-10

Enter former lover and still chemically combustible homicide detective, Tony Sonterra. In a parallel story, her brother-in-law is released from prison wanting his daughter, whom Clare is raising, back. Part of the plot has to do with finding her sister's murderer. <br />Clare believes her brother-in-law killed her sister even though the body was never found and he was never charged. Someone also trying to kill Clare, but keeps mistaking other people for her.<br />There are entirely too many plots going on at the same time in this book. You have to take an incredible leap of faith to believe this could all go on in a short span of time. Tony and Clare had chemistry and I enjoyed most of their scenes together. Most of the other characters are underdeveloped. Overall, it was fairly preposterous. It's a fairly quick read so if you are a romantic suspense fan, it is not a terrible book, but there are much better ones on the market.	2004-01-05

Since he cannot help the police and feels a responsibility for his friend, he decides to investigate himself. He ends up opening a Pandora's box of secrets going back thirty years.<br />Brady Coyne is a nice-guy lawyer. Recent novels featuring him have been a bit bland because frankly nice guys in crime novels are boring. This recent novel is the best one in years. The characters were well defined and the plot of suspenseful. Brady is still laid back and too nice, but this time he suffers some angst which makes him more human.

Unfortunately for one guest, a cutting remark made by another sent her to suicide. In order not to be socially ostracized the young woman who made the remark that caused the suicide embarks on a journey to Scotland to deliver a letter to the deceased mother.<br />I am usually not a big fan of the books written for Christmas by best-selling authors. The prime purpose of most of these books seems to be to cash in on the Christmas dollars people are willing to spend. I had high hopes for this book because I am a big fan of Anne Perry. It started with promise with one of the interesting secondary characters in the Thomas Pitt series, Vespasia Cumming-Gould. The story takes place when Vespasia is in her early thirties instead of the more advanced years of the Pitt series. I thought we would have some good character development and backstory for Vespasia, but instead the character portraits were superficial. The plot was not only rather ludicrous, but weak. Thankfully it's a short book with only 180 pages and wide margins. Save your money and read or re-read any of the excellent books in the Thomas Pitt series or William Monk series.	2003-12-21

In her life prior to her marriage to Alfonso, Lucrezia had already lived through rumors of her being a poisoner. She does not want to live with people looking at her strangely and always wondering about her, so she sets off to find the real poisoner. <br />Roberta Gellis has written a well-constructed atmospheric novel set in the Italian Renaissance evoking a sense of time and place with a delightful heroine It was a little confusing at first to get used to the many characters introduced at the beginning at the novel. Hopefully, most of them will stay around for the next Lucrezia Borgia mystery so it won't be a problem again. The premise was a fairly straightforward whodunit plot, but was very suspenseful. This looks to be another outstanding series from Roberta Gellis.	2003-12-01

I was hoping to move beyond the Chandonne brothers. If you have not read the previous books the reader will be totally lost because Cornwell seems to be tying up a lot of loose ends from previous books. It seems ludicrous that after all the grieving Kay Scarpetta did for Benton  that he gets resurrected. There is a big build up of events in this book, but the conclusion comes with amazing speed. It could not believe the story wrapped up so quickly.  First time reader, go back and read an earlier Scarpetta novel; they were actually good.	2003-11-23

The secondary cast was very effective. The plot was complex, but not confusing. There were good twists and turns. I guessed the ending, but not until three-quarters into the book. Very strong debut effort. I look forward to more books from Tracy.<br />The quotes by other authors on the back of the book referred to this book as funny. There was nothing in it that could be construed as humorous. It is about serial killing and stalking-two very unfunny subjects.

The kind of rain that has citizens anxiously awaiting the rise of the river with sandbags. This is the backdrop against which a baby-sitter and two teenage children disappear while the parents are on a getaway in Paris. Chief Inspector Wexford and Inspector Burden investigate the disappearances. There is no lack of motives or suspects here including a religious cult, suspicious neighbors, and an ex-husband.<br />I generally enjoy Ruth Rendell's Wexford series. With this one I felt I should like it rather than really liking it. I found it a bit hard to get into. The cast of secondary characters is not at all likable; I can't think of a single character that I cared about. The plot got fairly involved, but it was paced fairly well. Wexford's personal life gets quite a bit of ink and that's a good thing because he is a very interesting character. There was a very good twist at the climax. Sometimes when you are reading a series, your expectations are high. Overall,  it was not as good as other Wexford books. I felt a bit let down.	2003-11-16

DS Diane Fry and DC Ben Cooper are back in this fourth book of the series set in the Derbyshire Peak District.<br />I loved the first three Fry/Cooper books. This one is the weakest of the four, not to say it was not good, but the plot was a bit strange and chaotic. It seemed to jump from event to event and character to character too frequently. It was easy to get confused. The author spent almost no time in giving you any of the Fry/Cooper background so it is a big help to have read the previous books. Diane Fry and Ben Cooper have a complex and mostly strained relationship, which is what sets this series apart from other British crime novels. Their relationship has played a big factor in past books and it helps to fully understand it. I highly recommend the series as a whole, but was a little disappointed in this last entry.	2003-11-14

Hazel's story plays a little like Romeo and Juliet. Young lovers torn apart by family feud. Hazel leaves Highlands rather than have her lover lose his place in his family dynasty. She marries and moves on with her life only to meet up with her former lover years later. She has never forgotten him and decides to see where it all might lead, so after a bit of subterfuge, she brings Gemma with her to the Highlands in the guise of doing a cookery class there.<BR>Things get a bit tricky when her former lover is found dead and suspicion rests on Hazel.  <br />Crombie's strengths lie not only in tightly woven suspenseful plots, but the rich characterizations she brings to all her novels. Here we have not only the mystery that is intriguing in itself, but also the ongoing story of Gemma and Duncan. They have moved in together with their respective sons, but it is not smooth sailing for the family. Gemma and Duncan are extremely likable characters and I enjoy reading about them immensely.	2003-11-10

This was book had me hooked from the first page. The plot was skillfully written interweaving past and present facts. We have two very compelling protagonists that look like they were set up for a sequel, at least I hope so. This is the kind of thriller that keeps you on your toes from the first page to the last. It would have been a 5 star book, except the climax was a bit too unbelievable.  It was almost like a light bulb went off and suddenly the case is solved. It all unraveled a little too fast.

Ben teams up with Boston police to investigate the murder. It leads him to the seedy Mission Flats district where the now-dead prosecutor was investigating several gang-style murders. Before the investigation ends, death and betrayal spanning over twenty years are revealed.<br />This is a very complex and emotionally involving debut novel from William Landay. The first third of the book was a little slow going because there were three deaths taking place approximately ten years apart. It got a little confusing about which characters belonged to which time period. Once you get all the characters straight you are in for a flawless plot that questions more than just right versus wrong. The characters are colored in shades of gray, rich in dimension, and possess all the frailties of humanity. You never know if they are speaking the truth as they see it or the truth as it really is. Here you have a novel with a plot within a plot and secrets within secrets. <br />Excellent debut novel. Highly recommended.	2003-11-03

Jesse has a drinking problem, which he says does not interfere with his job, but was enough to get him kicked of the LAPD. He also has romantic dependency problems with his ex-wife Jenn. One moment he is all machismo, often found in Parker's male protagonists, the next minute he's a sad sap mooning over a woman who would rather sleep with other men than stay in their marriage despite saying she still loves him. Not that Jesse has any problem getting other women to sleep with him. They don't even mind when he tells them he is in love with his ex-wife and that he would go back to her in a shot as soon as she crooks her little finger.<br />In the midst of all this emotional turmoil, dead bodies pile up on Jesse's doorstep. It seems a serial killer is loose in Paradise. No problem, Jesse is on the case and in short order great strides in finding the culprits are made. Jesse has a little cat and mouse game going with the killers, but in the end they are no match for Jesse.There is also a subplot where Jesse  rides to the rescue of a teenage gang-rape victim.<br />This is a pretty quick read due to fairly large margins and a large font. The protagonist comes off as a bit of a superhero and the storyline is a bit too pat to be believable.  This is not to say this was a bad book, it was just so unbelievable at times that I had to shake my head. It was a nice, easy, uncomplicated read. You just have to take it for what it is.	2003-10-30

The characters were either weird or dull as dishwater. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it was excruciatingly boring. Toward the end, I was just skimming to put me out of my misery.	2003-10-27

The autopsy of the young nun reveals a shocking surprise, she had recently given birth. Dr. Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli investigate for the answers to the many questions this case raises. Why would two nuns with no contact with the outside world be attacked? Before too long a gruesome third killing is tied to the nuns attack and the FBI become involved. In addition to the investigation, Isles and Rizzoli must confront unresolved issues from their pasts that interweave with a crime that goes far beyond the murder of nuns and an unidentified woman.<br />Jane Rizzoli has appeared in THE SURGEON and THE APPRENTICE. It is not necessary to read the former stories to enjoy THE SINNER, but it helps with character development. Also, both earlier books are excellent. This is not a book for the faint-hearted. The crime scenes and autopsies are very graphic. The book is well plotted with some really good twists, and it really keeps you reading. I liked the characters, but both women seem to be a little more intelligent in their careers than in their private lives. The ending was a bit to pat and was a little bit of a letdown after the promise of the strong beginning and middle of the book. Overall, it was not quite as good as the previous Rizzoli books, but still far superior to most medical/forensic thrillers.	2003-10-26

The story opens with a student's apparent suicide and the stabbing of the protagonist's sister. More suspicious suicides follow and violence permeates Grant College.  <br />This is the third in the series featuring medical examiner Sara Linton, Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver, and ex-police detective Lena Adams. Sara and Jeffrey were once married, but are still involved romantically with other. Lena was victim of a horrific crime in KISSCUT, and is still emotionally broken in A FAINT COLD FEAR. It really helps if you read the previous novels to understand all these characters are going through. The characters are fully drawn and three-dimensional with both good and bad traits just like most people. I wish the violence was less graphic, but the story was very involving and quite suspenseful. It's a fast-paced book that is hard to put down until the very end.	2003-10-23

His predecessor in the loan-out program was JAG officer Lisa Morrow. Within days of starting at the law firm, Lisa is found murdered. Drummond and Lisa share some history together so he asks to be her family's survival assistance officer. Sean and Lisa's sister Janet, an assistant DA in Boston, team up to look into Lisa's death. At first it looks to be the work of a serial killer, but soon the trail leads to the firm's largest client, a telecom giant that controls the military's top secret Internet traffic. Before the dust settles the FBI, CIA, and local law enforcement are in on the action.<br />Sean Drummond is a bit of a wiseguy, very irreverent and sarcastic. He's hard not to like. The whole book has very strong cast of characters, both primary and secondary. The story has an involved, action-packed, suspenseful plot that hooks you from page 1. It's a long book coming in at over 400 pages, but it never drags or slows down. <BR>Highly recommended	2003-10-20

Their dreamed about idyllic existence gets a little rocky when Lena agrees to investigate the disappearance of a ATF intern for the family, in conjunction with the investigation by thre police headed by Joel. Joel works with  ATF agent Wilson McCoy looking for a serial killer that targets ATF agents. With duel investigations going it becomes clear that the case are connected.<br />Intricately plotted, but sometimes very confusing. There was a  segue into another part of the story that was very disjointed.  I had to check the title several times to make sure I did not pick up another book by mistake. All of a sudden with a chapter change, we have a whole new set of characters and setting with no known connection to the main story. Of course, it all ties together nicely at the end, but it could have been written better. It just did not flow quite right and it made the story drag at times. Characterization was quite good with a very strong primary cast. Lena Paget is a likable heroine and look forward to reading her next adventure hopefully in a stronger, more coherent storyline.	2003-10-19

Lord Harold Trowridge, the man of Jane's heart, calls on Jane to help seek out a traitor to the crown.  She must befriend a beautiful widow with rumored ties to Bonaparte. Once Jane makes Sophia Challoner's acquaintance, it is hard for Jane to conceive that Sophia has anything to do with the murder and mayhem that is taking place in and about Netley Lodge.<br />Stephanie Barron has made Jane a likable and clever heroine that chafes against the rules of society that bind her. Jane is still writing her novels, but there is little evidence of it in this story. Jane is too busy hunting for traitors to actually write. Barron evokes the Regency time period nicely, interspersing historical facts throughout the book. Many facts are highlighted as footnotes on the page they appear. Barron writes these stories in a style similar to the writing of the Regency period further bringing in an authentic sense of time and place. There are deft twists throughout this well-plotted book, and a very moving, poignant ending to the story.	2003-10-15

A FBI special unit compromised of psychic profilers and agents gets involved. Special Agent Isabel Adams is the physic profiler that is showcased in this book. She also happens to be blond and on the killers list of potential victims.<br />Kay Hooper often writes books with a touch of the paranormal. In fact there are six books in this series involving the same FBI Special Unit. They have all been pretty good if you don't mind the somewhat convenient device of \\"visions\\" being used to solve crimes. This book is the weakest of the six in the series. It relies very heavily on the psychic experience. The book gets bogged down in all the psychic detail.  It got to be a little too much when main characters would touch and they literally would spark. The book was suspenseful at times and the killer did turn out to be a surprise. It's not a bad read, but Hooper has done better in the past	2003-10-14

Carsely is a picturesque, quaint village. Agatha frequently gets bored, but luckily there is always a murder that she can investigate. In this outing, Agatha and her new next door neighbor, Paul, investigate who is playing tricks on grouchy old Mrs. Witherspoon, the owner of the haunted house. Before long, Mrs. Witherspoon is found dead at the foot of the stairs. Agatha likes to put her past public relations skills to use by helping the police. It usually lands her in trouble and this time is no different.<br /> I feel this series is getting extremely tired. Each book feels exactly like the last one. Agatha gets a new male neighbor, she starts to have romantic feeling about him, they investigate together, and by the end of the book they are usually on the outs. The characters have stagnated. The plots get recycled.  It's time to retire Agatha permanently.	2003-10-11

Not everyone dies, but there is a lot of death. Within barely 100 pages, there were already three human deaths and two dead animals. By the end of the book, there were so many deaths past and present that I was immune to it. That's not really a good thing. The book dragged quite a bit. I frequently put it down and really felt no need to get back to it. The narrative seemed disjointed; there was just too much going on. The climax was very anti-climatic. It seemed more like an afterthought to the story. There was a lot of buildup, but not much pay-off.  I do like the characters of Kevin Kerney and his wife Sara. There is good character development throughout the series. I have liked the Kevin Kearney series in the past and wanted to like this one, but this just was not as good as the others.	2003-10-10

Diamond and Mallin, are both strong personalities must learn to work together. The story was intricately plotted with many twists along the way.

This is the fourth Fethering mystery that features Home Office retiree Carole Seddon. Fethering is a West Sussex seaside village. Most villages are quaint and quiet without much going on there. Fethering seems to get more than its share of murder. This time the action revolves around Brackett House which is the historical home of writer and poet Edmond Chadleigh.  Carole has taken on the role of a trustee for Brackett House (the museum in the title). Tensions are high while trustees decide how to bring in some money to keep the museum afloat and also what to do about a proposed biography of Edmond Chadleigh. Before long a 90 year old skeleton is found in the garden, and shortly thereafter a murder takes place.<br />The Fethering series are very traditional cozy mysteries. Simon Brett has written a conventional, but entertaining whodunit. Broadly drawn quirky characters abound. It reminded me very much of the Agatha Christie Miss Marple books. Readers who want a light, witty, traditional mystery won?t go wrong with this one.	2003-10-08

Unfortunately, she has a severe problem with alcohol that causes her to have blackouts. After falling off the stage at one of the shows with no recollection of it, the band decides to replace her. On the way back to Portland from Australia, Mim holds true to form and drinks excessively on the flight. She arrives home not feeling very well, confronted with a man with a gun outside her door. He has her strip, puts her in the backseat, drives her around for a while, and then brings her back to her house. She calls the police to report the incident, but she can tell they don't really believe her. Shortly thereafter, pornographic pictures of Mim circulate on the Internet. Mim also has some family problems. Years earlier, her mother was run over by her father's truck. Her father got fifteen years in prison, but was just released on parole. Her brother is a drug dealer. Life seems like it can not get worse, but it does.<br />When I started this book, I was not sure I would like it. A story about a hard rockin', messed up chick really didn't appeal to me. I have to say within a few pages I was hooked. Mim is a total mess, but she is a fully fleshed out emotional being. I felt a real connection to her. At times, I felt real stress while reading the story. It was a fast-moving, page-turning novel. Don't start it unless you have a chunk of time to devout to it. Rainy Portland, Oregon provides ideal imagery to Mim's life and sets a dark and somber mood. There was a really good surprise twist at the end.<BR>Highly recommended	2003-10-06

The story starts with Milne assassinating two custom agents and an accountant, not the drug dealers that he was expecting. Years earlier, Milne started walking on the shady side of the law when he helped the brother of a girlfriend out of trouble. With his principles compromised, he starts dishing out his own brand of vigilante justice with a nice cash bonus for his efforts. His conscience does bother him about the three innocent deaths; he normally only kills the bad guys. Milne investigates the death of a young prostitute uncovering not only a web of serial killing and child pornography, but links to his own case.<br />THE BUSINESS OF DYING explores the darker side of human nature. In Milne, Kernick has created a complex human being; the line between good and bad is hard to define.   He is a contradiction, an idealist who doesnt believe in the death penalty, but is a killer who dispenses his own brand of justice. The story is compelling in its gritty, realistic details of Londons underbelly of society. Solid debut novel from Simon Kernick.	2003-10-03

There is a secondary story involving her on again/off again relationship with her first love Chuck Forbes. Chuck, the son of a former governor, is now detective on the Major Crime Team.<br />Alafair Burke is former deputy district attorney and is now a law professor at Hofstra School of Law, so she is knowledgeable about her subject matter. The characters were multi-dimensional and well developed. The plot of this story was pretty good, but tended to be slow at times due to the lengthy explanations of the legal process.  One annoyance in the book was the liberal use of acronyms. There were too many and it slowed down parts of the story even more. This is a good start to a promising series, but it could have been better if it were better paced.	2003-10-01

The first deaths involve a three-year-old child who was locked in the house with the body of his dead mother for three days, and a woman left behind a rubbish bin at the rail station. <br />Tom is a gloomy chap in the best of times. Now he is tormented by the thought of the child left with his dead mother. He makes it his personal mission to catch the killer. The characters are well-fleshed out with all the fragility and emotion that comes with being human. The subplots relating to the team and their interaction were very interesting. The reader really gains an emotional connection to these characters.<br />The story is told by the use of flashbacks so we get to know who the killers were. The present is a little harder to discern. One of the killers has changed his name and is living a \\"normal\\" life. The plotting is dark and emotional. You can try to figure things out as you read along, but things are not always what they seem. There are some good twists and turns. The ending was quite poignant and stayed with me several hours after finishing the book. The book was not perfect. There were some subplots that just seems extraneous and made the book drag in spots. Overall, it was a very good book and I look forward to the next entry in this series.	2003-09-29

With the use of every facet of his training, he and Jaime create a masterful plan to find a man with a brilliant mind trained by Cavanaugh himself in the art of disappearance. <br />In a myriad of plot twists and turns there is non-stop action. The plot is fast-paced and so riveting it is hard to put down. Cavanaugh and Jamie are well-drawn sympathetic characters that you can really care about. David Morrell seems to fly a bit under the radar, but to me he is one of the best in his genre. If you are a first time reader, Morrell has a wonderful backlist of books.  I would rank this one as one of his best.<BR>Highly recommended.	2003-09-27

After Phil's boat blows up, Melis is the only person alive with information pertaining to Marinth. It is information that someone wants at any cost. Her friends, her dolphins, her very sanity are threatened in order to get the information. Jed Kelby, an ex-Navy Seal, is also looking for Marinth. He and Melis become partners in the hunt for the madman threatening Melis. Along the way, Jed helps Melis deal with the scars of her past as they embark on a new emotional journey. <br />The first few chapters were very confusing and I was not sure if I would like this book. Many characters were introduced rather quickly and the premise of underwater cities was a little off the wall for me. Once I had the characters straight, the story unfolded at a quick pace and became very engrossing. The primary and secondary characters are engaging. The dolphins almost steal the show and  I would not be surprised if Iris Johansen's next book features Nicholas Lyons as the protagonist. This is a good, light read that will appeal to fans of the romantic suspense genre.	2003-09-24

Heated words are spoken and a duel is scheduled the following day. Beau, somewhat of a champion of the young officer, agrees to be his second. Before the duel takes place, Jacombe is murdered at Vauxhall's Pleasure Gardens. Nevill is accused of the crime. <br />Told in the first person voice of Beau Brummell, the author gives you a good sense of time and place. The story told in a sarcastic, witty style, moves along at a nice pace. It never gets boring.  Attention is paid to historical detail and many real people, including Beau, make an appearance in the story. Unfortunately a less than satisfying denouement keeps the story from receiving an unqualified recommendation.  Nonetheless, it is still a good book for fans of historical mysteries.	2003-09-22

It is a big help to read the first book because the author jumps right into the story and the characters aren't introduced at all. Basically, the plot revolves around a cat burglar helping Interpol catch another cat burglar. Believe me, it is very basic. There is really nothing here to sustain a whole book. It's a very long drawn out process and not very exciting.  The book reads more like the romance novel it once was. I can't believe romance readers would be very happy either in this diluted version. Annoyances abound like when an archeologist with a supposedly high IQ says she doesn't know what sackcloth is. Totally unbelievable as was so much of this book. Overall, it was a waste of time.

If I hadn't had so much time invested in it, I probably wouldn't have bothered to finish it. One problem with the book is the characters are not likable. Even Nina is whiny and rather annoying. It's a bad sign when a beloved  main character becomes irritating. The secondary cast around whom the plot revolves is a pathetic bunch of people. I could not care one whit about any of them. The plot was boring which is a big offense in the thriller genre. Part of the book dealt with Nina's conflicted relationship with Paul. I don't she her able to share her life with anyone. She really doesn't know how to compromise, so I think she should just head back to Tahoe and hopefully come back in a better story.	2003-09-16

He is always one step away form bankruptcy.  He is really an anti-lawyer kind of lawyer and a very likable character. The first chapter of this book was very graphic and extremely hard to read. The plot itself was suspenseful and a lot of twists to it. There was a good secondary story between homicide detective partners, Mike Morelli and Kate Baxter.

An apparent accidental death quickly turns into a murky whodunit reminiscent of the MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.  <br />The first quarter of the book is rather slow. There are a plethora of characters that takes quite a while to distinguish from one another. It became quite tedious at times. Just when you have the characters straight, the next problem starts. This book is built upon one false lead after another. I have never seen a book where the story seemed to be wrapped up and then it was back to square one again. It was just too much misdirection. It's a case of the perpetrator being the least talked about. Even the surprise twist at the end, it ended up not much of a surprise since there was not much left that it could have been. I am not much of a fan of books where discretionary justice is applied. Judge and jury should apply justice, or in this case a military court, not by a few individuals who deem it for the greater good. The last problem that has nothing to do with the author, is the bad editing. One mistake is understandable, but several times characters were called by different names. It started to be very annoying.  The editor was clearly asleep-not a good sign in a thriller.<br />Patrick A. Davis is a good writer and I am a fan of his other books, THE GENERAL, THE PASSENGER, THE COLONEL, and THE COMMANDER.  I would recommend any of those over this one.

Past and present intertwine as answers are sought for both the death of the redheaded woman and the disappearance of Mina Osborne.<br />Set in a small Irish village, the author's Irishness is evident in this richly atmospheric, slightly gothic-feeling mystery. The pacing of the novel was rather slow for the first half of the book and the ending was a little obvious, but overall the richly developed characterizations made this a book worth reading. HAUNTED GROUND was a good first effort by Erin Hart.	2003-09-08

Thomas Lynley and Lady Helen make a brief appearance in the beginning of the novel. Barbara Havers does not appear at all. <br />The setting for Elizabeth George's newest novel is the English Channel island of Guernsey. Americans, Cherokee River and his sister China, act as courier's of a set of architectural plans to be transported to Guernsey per the request of businessman Guy Brouard. Guy is building a museum to honor Guernseymen who resisted Nazi occupation.  Shortly after the Rivers' arrival in Guernsey, Guy is found murdered. China is arrested. One rainy night Deborah St. James opens her front door and there is River requesting her help. Deborah was China's roommate for her soul-searching three-year stay in California. Deborah feels a debt toward China and enlists her unwilling husband, Simon St. James, to aid the quest for the truth. What ensues is richly complex, multi-layered psychological drama. Sometimes it is too complex and too mult-layered.<br />There were a couple of problems with the book. There are an excessive number of characters. Some are simply not needed. The book was over 500 pages and it tended to ramble on quite a bit in the middle, which it a lumbering pace. The plot relied a little too heavily on misdirection that made certain elements confusing. It's still a pretty good book, but if you are Elizabeth George fan don't expect this to be one of her best.	2003-09-04

She is looking forward to getting away from her hectic work life and her ho-hum romantic life. Bailey barely arrives at the spa before the first body turns up. Since she is on the scene she decides to help out her friend and perhaps get a story while she is at it.<br />This is the second book by Kate White featuring Bailey Weggins. I liked the first one, but this one just did not connect with me. When I read this book, I couldn't help but compare it to the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich. Unfortunately, it compares unfavorably. Stephanie pulls off the sarcastic wit.  Bailey fails miserably. Stephanie knows she is inept at her job, Bailey thinks she is good, but she's just lucky. She grills various people with question after question and they answer her. I just want to scream, \\"why are you telling that woman a thing. Tell her to bug off.\\" <br />Dialogue is stilted, characters are unpleasant, and plot is substandard. My advice would be to skip it.	2003-09-01

Set in the Regency period, this book had everything you could possibly think of for that time period-espionage, games of seduction ala Dangerous Liaisons, adultery, incest, duels, murder, political intrigue, debauchery-you name it-this book had it. It was a intricate, twisting, turning, maze of a plot. Despite the cumbersome nature of the plot, it really did keep me turning the pages and for the 400+ pages, I nary skimmed a line. <br />Luckily the author provided a family tree for the complex intertwining family relationships. I didn't count the characters, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were fifty of them. Sometimes it got quite confusing. <br />This is a book that reads like a romance novel without the romance: intrigue was the emphasis. Charles and Melanie are very likable characters and  I hope they will be back, but in a less rambling plot than this one.	2003-08-27

After her body is discovered an investigation ensues conducted by a good ole boy Sheriff, a retired Texas Ranger, and the rural town's only black Deputy Sheriff. This is a highly unlikely threesome-as different from each other as they can possibly be. They add their own unique personalities and viewpoints to the story. In the course of the investigation a lot of the town's skeleton's come tumbling out of the proverbial closet.  <br />James Hime has written a very strong debut novel. Several times I thought I knew the outcome, but each time I was wrong. Intricately plotted, there is a twist at every turn. A very atmospheric novel which conveys the feeling of small town rural Texas both the good and the bad. I look forward to the author's next book	2003-08-26

The story begins with Alex McKnight rebuilding a cabin his father built in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. His Indian friend, Vinnie LeBlanc,ends up helping him.<BR>The first 100 pages deal mostly with rebuilding their friendship that became strained in NORTH OF NOWHERE, along with the cabin. Extremely poignant characterization dealing with loyalty, male bonding, test of friendship, and difference of culture. <br />In the second third of the book, action really picks up when Vinnie's brother, Tom, disappears. Tom, an ex-convict and ex-drug addict is trying to get his life into order. He takes a job as a moose-hunting guide in the wilds of Canada. Tom and his Detroit hunting party disappear without a trace. Alex and Vinnie head to Canada to find him. Events happen that strands Alex and Vinnie a very remote wilderness with little more than the clothes on their backs. Here their survival skills come into full-play. Fast-paced, page-turning action in this section.<br />The last third of the book deals with the why of what happened. There are plenty of surprises in store. I like the way Steve Hamilton can unravel his stories without a lot of misdirection, but at the same time keep the suspense level high.<br />Steve Hamilton is one of the finest crime writers working today. He continually weaves together detailed plotting, compelling primary and secondary characters, and heart-pounding action.	2003-08-24

Her mother and sister were killed six years earlier by someone close to her. She has not yet come to terms with it. Her relationship with her father, (former FBI profiler Pierce Quincy from earlier novels) is strained. She has something to prove to herself and to her father. She gets her chance when she stumbles upon a body at a FBI training trail.  She takes a leave of absence from the Academy, hooks up with Georgia Bureau of Investigation Special Agent \\"Mac\\" MacCormick. Mac had been involved in a Georgia serial killing investigation three years earlier and the trail led him to FBI headquarters in Virginia. Now three new woman are abducted and it a race against the clock to find them before they die. <br />From the beginning of the novel, the reader is drawn into the characters' lives. They are extraordinarily well defined.  This is a fast-paced, page-turning, can't put it down kind of a book. A lot happens in a little over 300 pages. Not to say everything was perfect. Clichés do abound, crimes are solved a little too quickly once everyone stops floundering around, and I for one cannot believe a cell phone will work in the middle of a desolate swamp. Despite a few minor problems, I found this to be a totally engaging , heart-pounding book.<br />Besides Kimberly, some characters from previous novels play a secondary role in THE KILLING HOUR. Lisa Gardner does a fine job tying her novels together by highlighting a different character each time, Rainie Conner in THE THIRD VICTIM, Pierce Quincy in THE NEXT ACCIDENT, and Kimberly Quincy in THE KILLING HOUR. The books feel both familiar and original at the same time.<br />Highly Recommended	2003-08-21

An egotistical albeit brilliant surgeon, David McIvey, inherits controlling shares in a non-profit rehab clinic. He wants to turn it into a for-profit surgical center. Therein lies the crux of the problem, the people in charge at the rehab center are not going to let it go lightly.<br />One of the problems with this book is that it never engages the reader. Most characters are underdeveloped or just plain boring. The antagonist is might not be a kind and considerate person, but turning a rehab center into a surgery center does not exactly make him evil enough to be glad he was dead.<br />The culprit ends up to be pretty obvious despite red herring galore. The plot was really rather simplistic with a ludicrous climax involving switched raincoats, wigs, and misdirection to catch the culprit. It sort of reminded  me of Mystery Writing 101. I have enjoyed other Kate Wilhem's books, this just was not one of them. It's a bad sign when you start looking for reasons to put down the book.	2003-08-20

A \\"probie\\" (rookie firefighter) survives, but is emotionally scarred from the experience of his first big fire. In the course of her investigation, she is forced to work with a long time master arsonist that is under the protection of the FBI. Working undercover, Georgia discovers the father of her child, who she hasn't had contact with in eight years, is involved.  As she digs deeper into the present case, she must confront another case previously thought solved, the death of her own firefighter father. <br />In this gritty and realistic portrayal of firefighters, Georgia has to deal with everything from helping a rookie overcome his ordeal, to her own emotional scars from her father's death, to working with an arsonist she detests. Not a book to be breezed through, this is an intricately plotted and emotionally complex book. <br />This is a wonderful entry in a really outstanding fire fighting series. Chazin shows her experience and expertise in this part science lesson, part human drama, and part crime novel. Don't miss the other two books in this series THE FOURTH ANGEL and FLASHOVER. All are excellent.	2003-08-18

There is a lot of Joanna's plate, but she handles it with fortitude <br />J.A. Jance's books are always rich in characterization. Joanna has been a long journey since the beginning of the series and each of the characters continues to grow. Each book is a stand-alone novel and Jance takes quite a bit of time in the beginning of the novel explaining earlier events. This part of the book dragged a bit for me. After the first 100 pages the pace picked up considerably. Jance can always be counted on the write a compelling story.	2003-08-16

Stephanie is a bounty hunter extraordinare, extraordinarily inept that is. Stephanie might not be good at bounty hunting, but she is fun.  Her life is never dull, with a totally wacky family and two hot men after her. <br />Fans of Evanovich will not be let down with this book. Not all the Stephanie Plum books are equally good, but I would rate this as one of the better ones.  Romance has taken a bit of a backburner, Grandma Mazur's antics are missing, but the mystery is more developed than in some of the other books. The humor is still present, I laughed out loud several times. <br />I high recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel good after putting the book down.	2003-08-15

Munch's connection with her friend comes to light when Munch's picture turns up in the friend's police file. Munch's past secrets are slowly revealed to the important people in her present life. <br />Seranella takes us into the world of everything from drugs and violence, to the life of an auto mechanic from first-hand experience. This is Barbara Seranella's sixth novel featuring Munch, but my first. I loved almost everything about the book and the character.  I have already gotten two of the earlier books and can't wait to find out more of Munch's story. This is a definite must-read for anyone who enjoys a gritty absorbing cirme novel.	2003-08-11

Unfortunately, he ended up getting murdered on his way home from the party.  Her former boss had suddenly come into some big money. Other wealthy people die. April investigates, links up the murders and solves the crimes to everyone satisfaction. <br />The strength of the April Woo series has always been the compelling cast of characters Leslie Glass employs. April Woo, a smart police detective who becomes meek and subservient in the presence of her Chinese mother, Skinny Dragon. April's mother has to be one the most terrifying mothers on the planet and their scenes together are always funny.  Mike Sanchez, the Mexican detective and partner to April in more ways than one. Past April Woo books have been rife with culture clashes with a comedic turn.  They have been highly enjoyable books. There is something missing in this one. Besides the primary cast, I felt no connection to any of the characters. The story felt disjointed and chaotic. At the end, I was just glad the book was over.	2003-08-07

Buck took justice into his own hands as television cameras were rolling. The crux of the problem is can Marty win an acquittal with the crime on tape for the jurors to see. There are two other related crimes that mesh nicely into the story.<br /> The story weaves a web around you and does not let go until the very last page. The basic story is Good vs. Evil.  Buck against the pedophile killer, Marty against a wayward judge. During the climax of the story which takes place in the courtroom, the action veers off into the preposterous.  It makes for an entertaining, but highly improbable courtroom scene.

Matt Linstrom, a college instructor and part-time photographer, was leading a pretty idyllic life or he thought.  One day his wife announces she wants a divorce and the next day she is gone without a trace. He is implicated in her disappearance. After being alienated from family and friends, losing his business, his job, and most of his possessions, he starts a new life in a new place. After fourteen years, he gets a call telling where his ex-wife is.  Matt starts a journey to Soldad County and to self-discovery. A gripping mystery ensues in Soledad County.  I don't want to give anything away, so I will leave it at that.<br />One of the strengths of CYANIDE WELLS is that Muller swaps viewpoints of two characters. At first, neither seemed to be a totally sympathetic character, but after allowing us into their thoughts, we get to know them and sympathize with their plights. I liked the more rural, isolated setting of the story. It lent a lot of atmosphere to the story. If I had any quibble about the book is that the ending was a little too evident, but the page-turning aspect to the story countered any problems I had with the ending.<br />Marcia Muller can always be counted on for a well-plotted story with compelling characters. I appreciate the need for series authors to take a break and write an occasional stand-alone book. CYNIIDE WELLS is a nice effort from Marcia Muller.	2003-08-01

Maitland always comes up with plots that have a unique twist. For avid readers in the mystery/thriller genre, this is much appreciated in contrast to the standard recycled plots many authors offer.<br />In BABEL, Kathy Kolla is on a leave of absence and considering leaving the police force for good. Police work is more than a job to Kathy, it's her talent so she is slowly drawn back into the hunt for a killer of a college professor. Suspects abound with ties to Islamic extremism and another path with suspects tied to medical genetics.  I leave the story for you to discover for yourself.<br />BABEL continues the excellent Brock and Kathy Kolla series. If you are a first time reader of this series, it would help to start at the beginning with THE MARX SISTERS, but not absolutely necessary. It is a stand alone book, but Maitland does not take a lot of time to go over what happened to his characters in previous books. An incident in SILVERMEADOW has a profound effect on Kathy's life, but is not really explained in this book. Whether you start with BABEL or an earlier work, you won't go wrong with this series.	2003-07-29

Very engaging characters in Antonio Burns, a special narcotics agent, his Air Force Colonel father, and his live-on-the-edge, drug-addicted brother. They have a complex and compelling relationship with each other. I loved  the parts of the book where they interacted with each other. Great scenes involving rock climbing.  The problem is that the main plot has been done hundreds of times before. I didn't feel the characters outside of the Burns men had any special chemistry together and I never really cared about what happened to them.<br /> Anton, Leonard and Roberto Burns characters make this a better book than it is and make it worth reading. A special mention for Anton's dog, Oso, who stole every scene he was in and should probably have a story of his own.	2003-07-27

In short order a newborn is found in a wood-burning stove, animal and human bones in a plastic bag are found in the woods while Tempe is at a pig-pull party, bones are found in a farm outhouse, and a plane crashes into a mountain bursting into flames. Tempe is involved in all the deaths and amazingly connects them all. Reichs ties it all up with a nice big red bow for the reader at the end, but not before throwing in a nice obvious red herring.<br />I loved Reich's previous novels. I didn't dislike this one even though it is not up to her previous work. I expect more from Reichs than this book delivered. The main problem was each of the many deaths came complete with its own set of characters. I kept having to flip backwards to figure out who people were. There are just too many characters to keep track of. If I'd had known, I would have written down the character and the relationship to the story as I read along. To be fair, I usually read books within a day or two, but read this one over a week. On the plus side, Reichs tried to explore the relationships between Tempe and her college-age daughter and between Tempe and Quebec detective, Andrew Ryan. It made Tempe more of a full-fleshed, human character with a real life. I just wish more time had been spent on that instead of the barrage of death.	2003-07-25

After a seemingly innocent mentally deficient man is being railroad for the latter murder he decides to take up his defense and find out why and by whom the judges were murdered. <br />This is one of the best legal thrillers I read in quite a long time. The story is gripping with enough plot twists and turns that you never know what will happen next. We get a glimpse of Antonelli's early law years involving the judges. The early  years' story is as interesting as the later present time story. It's almost like getting two good books in one.   This story keeps the reader involved until the very last page.	2003-06-19

He decided to take revenge on other child molesters.<br />Vigilante justice-it should have been a good premise, but I felt surprisingly disconnected from the characters and the story. I wanted to feel sympathy for Jack, but he came across as rather pathetic. Instead of using his energy to help his daughter get well, he wallows in self-pity. Strangely, he goes off the deep end and no one notices. He even embarks on a new relationship with a woman he met at the psychiatric home where his daughter resides. All the while he is planning which child molester  he is going to murder next. He even gets commended on what a great job he is doing at the law firm by his boss. Where does he find the time and why does no one notice anything?<br />This was my first Tim Green novel and will likely be my last. I don't like feeling I wasted my time at the end of a book.

I won't dwell on the rest of the story in this review, but will rather leave that to the readers to discover for themselves. <br />One of my criteria for a 5 star book is whether I could put it down or not.  That criterion was certainly met. This is a thriller that will keep you on your toes from the first page to the last. There are some coincidences to move the story along, but you have to give an author some leeway in crime/suspense novels. <br />The protagonist is not a totally sympathetic character, but you keep turning pages hoping that he can get out of the mess he made with his life.<br />Even with some minor defects it is a quick and satisfying read.	2003-06-16

All of Walter's novels are a pleasure to read because they are so well-crafted. There is a wonderful array of characters in FOX EVIL, all fleshed-out and wonderfully alive on the page. Only the ending is a bit of a let-down. I don't want to give anything away because trying to figure things out is half the fun, but the ending seemed a bit safe for a Walter's novel. <br />All and all, a page-turner of a book that keeps you guessing.

They had some relationship issues that were interesting, but since this is a mystery book, I would expect the mystery part to be better than the relationship part.<BR>Only die hard Slider fans should read this one.	2003-06-08

That's because Reacher is a character without a lot of baggage-literally. He has no home, no car, no family and not much more than the clothes on his back. No, he's not a derelict scrounging around in the garbage cans, rather he is ex-Military Police who just chooses to travel light and sees where life takes him. Usually that involves an adventure with a lot of shooting bad guys. Belief has to be suspended occasionally because no one could possibly get into as much trouble as Reacher does. Each Reacher novel is set in a new location with a new cast of supporting characters.<br />The first eighteen pages of Persuader have so much action, I was wondering if I was reading the climax instead of the first chapter. Inevitably, the pace has to slow down. There are some moments that drag, but overall it's a page-turning book. One quibble I have with the book, is that the continuity is broken by a back-story that dispersed throughout the present day story. The back-story just did not transition well. I was often lost for several paragraphs until I realized that the scenes took place ten years ago. It would have been better go give the past story it's own page and italicize it so the reader knows it is separate from the main story. Another problem is that the book veers off into the implausible one time too many for me. <br />Being a Lee Child fan I wanted to give Persuader 4 stars because I did enjoy it, but in the end just felt that this was not one of Child's best books.	2003-06-04

She started a P.I. business to hold on to her family's plantation. She is the last in the line of Delaney's with no sign of a progeny in sight much to the chagrin of a resident ghost named Jitty. Jitty is around to give Sarah Booth a hard time and to add the comic relief. Haines has created a witty, well-written novel rich in southern charm and atmosphere. The character relationships work as well as if not better than the mystery. I was a little disappointed at the conclusion of the book. If the author had not taken the easy way out at the end I would have given the book 5 stars.	2003-05-31

Suspensful to the very last page. This is the third book and best in the Marshall Bahr series. It might be beneficial to read Erickson's earlier books, but not necessary. Hard to put down so leave plenty of time to read it.	2003-05-29

The plot is slightly implausible, but overall the plot is so suspensful that any implausibility can be forgiven. Emerson is a first-rate writer.	2003-05-29

I started skimming the first half of the book. None of the characters really grabbed my attention. The second half of the book was suspenseful with some really good twists. The book had redeemed itself in my eyes until the last two pages where there seemed to be yet another twist which took me days to figure out. If you are a true Lehane fan, I would recommend the book, but if you are starting out with this author, read one of his other (much better) books. True Lehane fans don't expect too much.	2003-05-25

I read two later Quinn Garner books which I liked so much that I decided to read Jane Waterhouse's backlist. I found the characters complex and compelling. The plot was a little bizarre at times, but I found the book hard to put down.	2003-05-25
