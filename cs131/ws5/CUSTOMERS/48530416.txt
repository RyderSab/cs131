I read it in two days, and found myself laughing out loud, which is rare.  I found the best part to be his description of becoming a 128 lb sumo wrestler, and being surrounded by \\"man fat\\" as he plowed into his opponent.  There's a photo of a race, but everybody seems to be looking behind them.  I couldn't figure it out until I started reading the chapter, that Mr. Davis decided to take up backwards running.  It's amazing the feats he attempts to conquer, in his quest for a fulfilled, exciting life.<br /><br />\\"The Underdog\\" is \\"What Color is Your Parachute\\" for an aging Gen-X, who want to feel unique and fulfilled, but have no idea how to do it.  I recommend this book, not just for being well-written and enjoyable, but also for touching on how scary it is to grow up, take on adult responsibilities, and live up to the expectations of the family, partner, and self.  Mr. Davis' self-deprecating humor is charming, and I found myself rooting for him.  Maybe he would be a great matador, maybe he would win the Finnish sauna contest, maybe he would be happy with his life and find satisfaction with the mundane as well as the fantastic.  Maybe.	2005-10-13

I got it from a friend who didn't finish it, and now I know why.  I read about half, skimmed the rest, stopped and read when I saw somebody was getting peed on, decided I could have lived the rest of my life quite nicely NOT having read that, and then fast forwarded to the end. I'm sure I missed a lot of plot by not reading the last half, but at least my soul didn't suffer.  The writing is slow, plodding, methodical, and doesn't sound or feel like the voice of a troubled adolescent, full of rage, or even ambivalence.  The sex is vulgar and coarse, but when it gets to the actual sexual material, there's no processing of feelings or sensations; perhaps that is the only part that seems like it could come from a teenage boy.  I've read a lot of repulsive or vulgar material that was fascinating, like, \\"Ecstasy\\" and \\"Fox Girl.\\"  This book simply didn't interest me on any level.	2005-10-10

I think it had some unnecessary rehashing of the politics of Oz, which slowed it down. Liir is an interesting character, the \\"everyman,\\" and the weight of his deeds weighs as heavily on him as Elphaba's cloak. I found \\"Wicked\\" to be a satisfying read, but at times dull, and the same is true of this book. It's a bit preachy, yet some of the sexuality seems out of place. Overall, a good read, but not fantastic. The ending was in some ways expected, but when it ended I couldn't help but think, \\"Oh, set up for the sequel,\\" leaving this book unfinished. So, in closing, entertaining and well written, but I wouldn't read it twice.	2005-10-07

There was a lot going on, and I thought the story with Jane was unnecessary.  More time could have been spent on Toshi's family, or even on how Toshi felt about what was happening in his life.  Toshi remained a blank slate, and I never did understand his motivation for some of his actions.  It's a quick easy read, and I didn't find it dull, just not satisfying.  I didn't find the writing to be incredibly adept; it was competent for telling the story.	2005-09-19

There was no methodology presented, so I have to take the author's word that he did the research.  And, isn't that what this book is about, NOT taking somebody's word that a presented fact is the absolute truth?  The information is interesting, but I found the underlying message, that what we accept as the truth isn't always that simple or easy, far more intriguing and frightening.  Take the theories with a grain of salt, and enjoy the imaginative, accessible view of economics.  Who knew economics could be fun?	2005-09-19

I wasn't interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation.  We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences.  I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading.  I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure.	2005-09-16

The characters at \\"Sellevision\\" are a motley mix of characters one might see at any large corporation, and their rise or fall is dependent on the tides.

This book follows Maurey, after she has Sam's baby, marries her horrid high school sweetheart, and loses custody of her second baby after leaving him on top of the Bronco as she drives off in a drunken stupor. It follows her journey to find her soul and sobriety. I remember vaguely seeing the movie, \\"Floating Away,\\" which is based on this book. The book is MUCH better.

I do find the comments in the reviews, about how now Charleen would be given Prozac and sent on her way, both insulting and untrue. It is insulting from the standpoint that most competent doctors do not believe medication treats social issues and existential angst. I find it untrue in that Charleen does not appear depressed or anxious; she seems to be redefining herself after her life has been turned upside down, and it takes going back to where she started to find out how far she has come, and how strong and independent she is now. The twists and turns weren't hard to figure out, but didn't seem forced or contrived. I enjoyed the novel. It isn't ritzy or racy, but a wonderful story of growth and acceptance.	2005-07-16

It isn't particularly deep or meaningful, but certainly jaunty and fun.  Ms. Rafkin has an eye for the absurd.

I liked \\"Midnight Mass,\\" best, the story of a priest, a Jew, and vampires, as it brought up some interesting theology questions. I have wondered since I was a kid how Jewish people protect themselves from vampires. What a great story. The best stories, IMHO, were the novellas at the end, \\"Midnight Mass,\\" \\"Yellow Fog,\\" and, \\"Red Reign.\\" There are shorter stories that are great, but the novellas made the book for me. There were only two stories that didn't interest me and I skipped. That's not bad for such a large book, and believe me, it lives up to its name, it is big!	2005-07-10

I'd say the book is evenly divided between the convicts and sea faring information. I learned quite a bit about bilges, tar, shipwrecks, and the history of sea travel in the 1700s. I bought the book for the stories of the convicts, so I was a bit disappointed, but learned so much about a topic I knew absolutely nothing about, sailing the high seas, it evened the score.

The story is moving and realistic, and quite touching.  His interaction with the nurse is the vehicle for the novel, but I think he could have written it without other characters, and simply let the experience and thoughts of the protagonist flow to carry the book.

There is some helpful information, but the bottom line is, \\"make yourself happy first.\\" Men and women are treated respectfully, with the views of each presented with kindness and humor.

The comments on racism could have been thought provoking, but seem to imply all Caucasians have to apologize for being \\"white.\\" One chapter discusses how \\"whites can't tell blacks apart,\\" but Mr. Rock lumps all \\"whites\\" into one category, ignorant of the racism and persecution many \\"whites\\" have endured, and not all come from the same place and status. By the time he got to talking about doctors and how they shouldn't be paid, I was finished. I can hear racist rants anywhere; just because this is couched in the guise of comedy, it makes it no less of a prejudiced, racist view. Mr. Rock openly admits it is racist, but assumes people will find it amusing and enlightening. I found it to be neither. The sociology of race has been written about in more interesting, engrossing texts; I'll stick to those.	2005-05-18

I agree that the first three stories, set in and after Vietnam, make the book. One could read these three stories and consider the book worth the time investment. The rest of the book is well written and memorable, delving into relationships, boxing, and Schopenhauer.

The writer doesn't mince words or make excuses, she lays out her life, her pain, and her fat. She doesn't cut a sympathetic figure, and she isn't trying to be one. I had difficulty finding a context for the novel. Why write it? Was it for self exploration? To explain something to people she knows? To chew the fat?

Perhaps the forced language that makes one think the story is set in the south, but it turns out they are in California.  How about the sterotyped and two dimensional characters?  Or perhaps the plot, which is lackluster and transparent.  Oh, the agony.  I read the first 50 pages, looked here and there, and read the last two chapters.  The adult theme makes this book unsuitable for children/teens, but the level of writing will bore most adults.  Truly, a must skip book.	2005-05-03

The story was ok...not great, not terrible; it was entertaining, but certainly not prize winning fiction. It's the story of two brothers, one girlfriend, an accident?, and how a little sister responds to it, both immediately and later in her life.

Then, about halfway through, it gets weird and out of character and tedious. The end of the book made no sense at all; the final action is childish and immature, everything the girls proved they weren't as they survived. Maybe it was to show they are still children, despite everything that happened. There's also one \\"scene\\" between the girls that is disturbing and didn't really seem necessary, like it was written only for titillation.

I don't identify with her at all. It's an interesting read, and I appreciate her descriptions of navigating health care and using the resources she has to learn what she can on her own.

It reminded me of \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\" the film by Woody Allen, wherein each character represents a philosopher (the blind Rabbi is Aquinus 'the eyes of god'), and this book is similar.  I tried to figure out which philosopher was represented by each character, and how the interaction propelled the protagonist.  The plot is fast paced and flows well. The use of poetry is not facetious; it enhances the story. I enjoyed it, although I may be admitting my ignorance by saying I didn't really \\"get\\" the ending.	2004-12-11
