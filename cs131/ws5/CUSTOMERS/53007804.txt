It's a good read that holds one's interest, even if the <br />characters are not likeable.  Lew is tiresome with his depression. I wanted Adele arrested.  That  author had no duty <br />to protect her; don't know if Florida law requires one to report <br />what happened to her, but this author was very stupid. What <br />celebrity would allow a young girl in his home and what kind <br />of foster mother would stay in the car outside?  If the reader <br />can get over the unlikeable characters, which anyone who reads <br />Robert Parker has to do, then I recommend this book.  Was <br />going to give 4 stars, but Mildred Pierce is my favorite movie <br />too. <br />	2005-10-10

This book is ok, however <br />there are not 3 Mrs. Parkers.  Two and one Ms or Miss Parker. <br />Also it's nuts that one could not pay off a $39,000 loan on <br />50 acres of land.

The mystery is interesting, although  if one reads a lot of mysteries the who done it is pretty easy to figure.

It is hard to put this one down, particularly in reading about the woman and her baby missing in the swamp.  You have to find out what happened to the baby!! I gave this book 4 stars and maybe should have given it 5 stars, for Bobby Lee alone. My main problem is that Jo Beth knows it all and is such a true butinski that she is rather unbe- lievable.  In this book, she comes up with an ending that I found objectionable.  The money in the story does not go to the person who deserves it.  Sure, he may not enjoy it, but the one who has it has no right to it at all, but that's ok because Jo Beth likes that person and she knows best.  Criticism aside this is an excellent read and I am avidly looking forward to the next book.	1998-07-15

The rooms are named after the ladies who plied their trade there.  Thea Barlow, an editor for Western True Adventures, is not bad as a modern day main character. I really liked  the Sheila character, who is a master chef and Tarot reader, deluxe and hope to hear more of her in the future.  Maybe she and Thea will open a restaurant. My only criticism is that this is one of those book where I came up with the answers much before the main character.  It seems odd that she wouldn't have had a laptop with her and would have looked Frogskin and Muttonfat up.  I knew muttonfat was something else when I first read it but Thea, of course, takes much longer to find out.  Anyway this was a good read, and I would read future books when available.	1998-07-04

The private citizen who butts into an investigation for no reason, other than to be snoopy.  This innkeeper actually says at one point that there's been a murder on this island and somebody's go to start talking.  Yeah, but why to her? She's nobody with no right to question anyone.  This is just irritating to me as a reader.  I want a good reason for the main character to investigate.  I want them to be paid or have a vested interest in a case.  I hate the volunteer or snoop which we see in so many books.  I really hated the char- acters in this book, especially when the cousin hits the obnoxious guest on the head with a plate and that's alright, because he was so despicable. Don't these writers understand about lawsuits? Mere words from this guest would not constitute legal provocation for him to be assaulted?  I am ashamed to admit that I finished this book, but I only did so to see how bad it would get and I was not disappointed, it was magnificent in its badness.	1998-07-04

E.J.'s, the wife, reaction to her missing husband, is pretty well written and seems true to life.  The author loses me completely in Willis'story about his disappearance.  When he has the chance to escape and doesn't; I completely lost interest.  I detested the character of Rogene so much, it would have been alright with me for anything to have happened to her.  Why Willis would want to help Tater and Rogene is completely baffling.  And Tater is as much a criminal as the other bad guys in this book. E.J.'s cop friend Luna is also apparently stupid.  She doesn't call for back-up when she goes to the turkey farm-truck stop.  However, I gave this book a 3 because I did finish it and the story of the rock made up for the stupidity of the story. This rock sounds like a really interesting place to visit!	1998-07-04

Jackson books can be read for the atmosphere alone. You get wonderful descriptions of Martha's Vineyard, not to mention great food along with some recipes.  I'm dying to try Blue Fish Pate.  The only problem I have with these books is that it is tiresome to read about how beautful Zee, the wife, is.  This goddess is just too perfect and it's boring to be constantly reminded about all her glory, but this is something not unique as Robert Parker's description of Susan Silverman and all her beauty has irked me for years, but I still love Spencer so I still can enjoy these Vineyard books.	1998-06-07

It's a good start; his main character, Harding, is complex and smart.  I really didn't like this book at first, because I HATED his client, Elenya Rosenberg, whose husband, Harding is following. I hated her worse than the husband; and Harding is always talking about how he has to protect Elenya.  But hating the client is nothing new, I'd never read another Spenser,  if I let that bother me.  Harding really won me over when he is told by someone that that person had been on hold so long, he had to listen to the whole soundtract of South Pacific and Harding asks &quot; Broadway cast or Movie version?&quot;  Since, that's something I would ask and since we both like old monster  movies, I want to read more books about this character.	1998-05-29

As a small- time contractor, he treated his customers like lice, and he had more process servers after him than both Clintons combined.&quot;  Move over, Raymond Chandler.  Read this in one sitting.  Even though I hated the ex-girl friend and hoped she'd get iced or at least didn't care, Stone makes you  care about the story.  It moves fast and has interesting characters.  The final &quot;show-down&quot; is hilarious; this should be a movie.  I plan to read all the Streeter books.	1998-05-24

He has good support too in his friend, Ralph (maybe a Latino Hawk?).  I even liked Tres' Mother, and his cat.  What I didn't like was tres having to take a 4-year old on surveillance.  This was a job for which Tres' boss was getting paid, even though the 4-year  old is adorable,  this was too cutesy.  The  worst thing in the book is probably a minor detail to most people but it really bugged me.  The fact that Tres is constantly being threatened with various punishments for working without a license. Mostly in ths book he is working for his friend, Milo, a lawyer.  Unless Texas is different from most states, One does not need a PI license to investigate for a lawyer.But it is not clear that Milo is licensed in Texas.  Anyway this is a minor glitz, if any, since surely Tres will have his license in the next book....  If you like PI's this one is pretty good.	1998-05-24

Felt as if I were in Casablanca looking for the letters of transit, while in the book we're running around New York looking for an extinct spice supposedly recently found, but also recently stolen.  Loved all the characters and the food descriptions are wonderful.  This book is really enjoyable for everyone who likes to eat. As a tee-totaling vegetarian, I would never eat or drink muchh of anything described, but it all sounds so fascinating.  I plan to read this book  and the Gourmet Detective a 2nd time, just for the ambience.  Normally I don't care for British detectives (except for Morse and Dagliegh&lt; sorry about the spelling) but this book takes place in America and even if it didn't (as the Gourmet Detective) it is wonderful.  The only unbelievable part of the book is the authentication of the extinct spice.  How could it possibly be certified as Ko Feng which no one has seen in 500 years? It seems to me that all the experts could say is  that this spice is something completely new or unknown and may be Ko Feng.  Anyway, this is an excellent book and makes for great reading.	1998-04-06

It's very believable that she would ask to work with someone she saw on t.v. and find him shall we say, less than perfect.  The description of New Orleans politics was quite believable as we have a lot of good old boys in my state as well, but I sure hope we aren't that corrupt.  I couldn't believe the description of the Cajun living conditions, with children running after cars on their road, I hope that was greatly  exagerated.

It reminded a bit of Eric Van Lustbader's works, which we haven't seen in a while, but only a bit. I've been eager to find a thriller that does not involve the main characters being chased.  We do have a chase here, but it's really a chase within a chase.  I can find no criticism of this book, except for one minor detail, which probably no one else would consider criticism.  It's just that this reader  is extremely tired of the &quot;breathtakingly beautiful girl&quot;.  This book would have been just as good  without that detail.  Couldn't the Commander have been in love just with her mind? Anyway, I hated to come to the end of this novel and look forward to more by this author.	1998-02-09

She goes to High Point during the furniture market without a room reservation. N.C. District Court judges have access to a sec- retary who would have handled any reservation. Maron doesn't even discuss Knott staying in the home of the Judge for whom she's subbing. It is inconceivable to image a Judge sleeping on a stranger's couch.  She could have slept at the courthouse.
