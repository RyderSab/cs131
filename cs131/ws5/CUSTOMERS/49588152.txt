Two of his favorite toys are Woody and Buzz.  One of the things that happened in the book is Woody got kidnapped and almost sold to the konishi toy museum in Japan.  Luckily Buzz and some of the other toys risked their lives to save him.  Many other things happened throughout the story.  Toy Story II, writen by Leslie Goldman, was a fun book to read.  It kept my interest throughout the book.  With each chapter, I wanted to read more. I found a pattern in the chapters.  one chapter told about what Woody was doing.  The next told about what the other toys were doing to save him.	2000-11-03
