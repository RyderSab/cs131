It Happened to Nancy is a touching story that every teenage girl should read. It shows you that you are not the only one that goes through things such as rape or AIDS. Nancy was a very brave girl who should have had the chance to live. I love how this book shows that she was confused and needed help because most of us do. The questions and answers at the end of the book were very helpful.	2000-10-12

Mitch Album, a former student of Morrie's at Brandeis University, tells about the last couple months of Morrie's life. In the summer of 1994 Morrie was given his death sentence.  Morrie knew long before this day that something was seriously wrong.  It wasn't until now that he found out he had Lou Gehrig's disease.After Mitch graduated Brandeis University he lost touch with Morrie until 15 years later.  Mitch was flipping channels when he saw Morrie talking about his disease on Dateline.  Mitch watched this episode and a week later called up Morrie.  Morrie wanted Mitch to come and see him so Mitch flew from Detroit to Boston just for Morrie.  They caught up on old times and it became a ritual that Mitch would fly to Boston every Tuesday to visit Morrie.  The two of them would talk all day long and then Mitch would leave until the next Tuesday.  Mitch continued to visit every Tuesday for the next few months and was there for Morrie as he suffered through his long and painful death.  This was a very touching and meaningful story of a mans struggle to live and how to say good-bye.	2000-10-03

The beginning starts out talking about the first murders and the reading is very interesting, but as the book progressed, there were spots in the book that were so long and boring.  For the most part, the boring parts talked about how the police weren't able to find any evidence or what had to be done in order to find the evidence. I guess the book wasn't made to be extremely interesting in the first place. It was made to tell the stories of the murdered girls in Kansas and show the loss of their families. Other than those boring spots, the book was actually quite good. The author was very descriptive and always gave a good sense of what was going on. I beleive that this author told the story of what happened to these four girls really well. I give a lot of credit to Dan Mitrione for taking on this project and going through all of the trouble of interviewing all of the people involved with this case to accurately tell his story.	2000-10-03

Bradley started out explaining how we, as a society, separate between the living and non-living. This led to many topics on the subject of death, which was not appealing to me. He did, however, do a good job of explaining his thoughts, but it just wasn't an interesting topic I suppose. The author seemed to repeat many things throughout the book and didn't have a clear point, just to write about death. Overall I do not recommend this book, not only because of the content, but it is a little depressing reading about death.	2000-10-02

It is a book about a girl whose name is Nancy. She is only 14 years old. One day she went to this concert with a group of her friends called the &quot;gaggle&quot;. At the concert she has an asthma attack and goes to stand in the back of the room by herself. This is where she meets the other main character &quot;Collin.&quot; She invites him over one night and before he leaves he,unwillingly in her case, rapes her and  leaves her with the HIV virus. It is a true book based in diary form, giving a good description on how rape is and the realization of how AIDS kills.   The purpose of this book, I think, was to get teenagers to be aware of what sex and &quot;love&quot; can do to them. I would and will continue to recommend this book to every teenager because I think they should all read this book.	2000-10-02

Alice is naively ripped into the strange, but in her mind wonderful world of drugs.  It also goes into sad and morbid encounters of how the need of drugs will drive a person to any limits to feel a &quot;high&quot;.  She tries to fight her way through all her life's addictions with the help and wisdom she learned from all her friends along the way. In the end she still finds herself picking up the shattered pieces of her life one too many times.                 I really loved this book because it showed the raw, hard truth of the matter with very high use of imagery.  It's a book for the heart and the mind, because it takes through the cruel and unusual reality of life on drugs.  It also wakes you to how young each generations starts using.  At the same time it saddens you, because Alice could be your best friend or your sister and you wouldn't even know.  I think this book will always be a big time favorite, because it tealches us so many lessons in the everyday life that is filled with friends and the pressure that come along with them.  It is a really good read for any mature age group.	2000-10-02

He was born and raised in Minnesota so that should easily tell everyone that he is one to speak his mind.  The life story of this hard-body is very crucial and political.  Once you read I Ain't Got Time To Bleed, you instantly know where Ventura stands on the issues of politics.  He is neither a democrat nor a republican.  He is a member of the Reform Party, otherwise known as the Independent Party.  As a rebellious teenager, a Navy Seal member, a wrestler, and a governor, Ventura provides us with action-packed moments that are not only physical, but also emotional.  People who read it need to be very up-to-date on economics.  If you understand politics, then you will do very well in understanding this book.  Ventura doesn't really take his time to explain what he's going to do for the state of Minnesota.  He basically tells us what he's going to do; he doesn't show it.  He does, however, show his feelings about the political parties and a phrase everyone should know:  &quot;Keep the Democrats out of the boardroom and keep the Republicans out of the bedroom.&quot;	2000-10-02

As David illustrates his changes as a person from the time he was rescued from the home of his abusive mother, to the time he finds the true love of his life, he keeps the reader actively involved.  Not only do we want to reach out and comfort him during the hard times, but also show him the correct way to survive his daily life. Every step of the way Pelzer keeps us thinking, and never fails to keep readers totally enthralled in his third masterpiece.  However, if you have read the first two books in this trilogy, you may want to check this one out at the library.  Repeat readers may become bored within the first few chapters, when Pelzer overlaps into the second book, and in the frequent flashbacks he uses throughout.   Perhaps if the author illustrated more heavily on the present and his adult life, the book could be a must buy.  But the repetition of the details from his childhood creates a &quot;put you to sleep&quot; type feeling.  Overall, this is a good writing, but definitely not his best work.	2000-10-02

Navy's Elite Seal Team Two	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Good To Go	Good To Go is a book written by ex-NAVY SEAL Harry Constance regarding the time that he served in the Vietnam War. Constance recounts his three tours of duty as a SEAL during the war and describes his missions in great detail. Though some of the missions sound exaggerated, most of them are believable. He doesn't try to make himself out to be a super hero, but comes across like one in several parts of the book. While Harry was serving duty he was also going through personal problems that he briefly describes.  Politics played a large role in the Vietnam War and Harry shares his opinions on this.<br />One of the only complaints I have about this book is that it lacks flow. The chapters skip around a lot and are not linked very well. In one paragraph he will be in the jungles of NAM and the next he is sitting in his kitchen arguing with his wife.<br /> Over all this is great book until the later chapters, when Constance starts talking about his personal life, which most of us couldn't care less about. I could not quit reading until the last four or five chapters. After that it was a struggle to finish the book.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in war tactics and a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at some of the amazing stuff that goes on. Good To Go gave me a whole new outlook on the Vietnam War and what the soldiers were going through as they were being forced to fight and die in a battle halfway around the world, while being criticized for it back in the US.	2000-10-02

Jon Krakauer tells Chris' story by asking the people he met along the way and his family, as well as information he left in journals and on postcards.  Along with his journey there are other short stories about people who have tried similiar feats.  There is even one chapter written by Krakauer detailing his own death defying quest to climb Devil's Thumb in Alaska.<br />  I personally enjoyed &quot;Into the Wild.&quot;  It made me feel pity and sadness toward Chris one moment, then I would sense his desire for adventure and root for him to survive.  The author tells the story of McCandless in the way he thought it should be told, as if Chris were a hero.  I must admit though that the way the book is written is kind of confusing.  The author has other stories in the middle of the book, which interupt the flow of the story.  Even with these slight interuptions, the main story still manages to flow on afterwards.<br />  I think &quot;Into the Wild&quot; appeals to the outdoors types, nature lovers, and those similiar to McCandless, carefree and seeking adventure.	2000-10-02

Dave Pelzer tells about the obstacles he overcame, such as interacting with others, once he left his mother's house. He talks about his biggest fear of becoming like the mother he hates so much.  I liked this book because it made me think about how I wanted to treat my children in the far future. I was shocked that a mother could cause her child such pain. I was amazed that such a small child could suvive such brutality and still grow up to be a great person.  The book is a great ending to the three part series(A Child Called It, The Lost Boy). I can see the three of these books becoming a movie one day. I feel that people will be reading these books for years to come. A Man Named Dave was so well written that I couldn't put it down.	2000-10-02

I cried several times throughtout the course of reading it.  It was a story about a student and his number one teacher.  His teacher (Morrie) was dying from ALS and he was too caught up in work to care until the student(Mitch) lost his job due to a strike.  They met everyday to talk about marriage, the meaning of life, and so on.  This book made start to think about my family and how important they are to me.  Most of the things Morrie said were heartwarming and confident.  I felt that I knew Morrie and he considered myself as a friend, but we'd never met.  The book completely comes alive in my eyes.  I was enthused and entertained through the whole read.  Mitch Albom, the author was trying to show that it is very important to stay close in touch with friends and family because you'll never know when you'll have to say goodbye.  Morrie was not scared of death.  Instead of being scared of death he faced it and looked at himself as being the lucky one.  He had about a year to say goodbye to everyone that was important to him.  The best thing about this book is that Morrie has all of the answers to every question that I have wondered about, and it's comforting.  I recommend this book to anyone that likes to stay interested in what they read.	2000-10-02
