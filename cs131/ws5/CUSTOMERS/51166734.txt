The problem of literal languages emerged clearly in the 1920s when Western linguistists noticed that sense-data are primarily symbolic. Today, only the physical sciences have found a precise symbolic language.  This precise language expresses absolute truths with physical laws, which are dimensionally invariant equations. This precise language was possible because all physical symbols get their meanings from each other.  No other field of thought has found such a precise language.<br /><br />The author of this book is on the right track of research because all other fields of thought must build precise languages too if they want to express absolute truths.  In these other fields, I conclude that finding precise languages is possible.  I recognize this possibility if the meanings of the symbols created and used in a specific field are also related logically or functionally.<br /><br />The languages used by the field of religion present another problem.  This problem emerges when a religious document is translated from one national language to a different national language.  This is not possible without making errors. This is why this author has found errors in translating the Old Testament into England's King James Version of the Bible<br /><br />The work of the author should be helpful to people who are trying to link the creation of the Old Testament to modern science. But, I do not believe that Moses' creation fits with the Big Bang theory of modern physicists because I agree with Moses' creation sequence and disargee with the Big Bang theory.<br /><br />A 'day' to Moses is an 'era' or 'many human generations', as the authos says.  And, as the author says, God's 'rest' is not the opposite of the Western world's symbol 'motion' because God creates eternally.<br /><br />People who interpret religious documents must respect these language problems.  I believe that today's terrorism has its origin in these language problems.	2005-07-24

This statement can be understood better if one interprets the teachings of Jesus metaphorically and includes the gnostic Gospel of Thomas in the research.  Further, modern science was given its first major boost with the panentheism of Bishop Nicholas of Cusa in 1440.  With Cusa, we find for the first time that the universe has no center. Cusa was prior to Copernicus; is cited by Kepler; and was educated at the University at Padua where Galileo taught.  The followers of Cusa can be traced to Italy (Da Vincim et al), to France (the Merseene Group), to Germany (Kepler, Leibniz, et al) and to Georg Cantor.  None of these followers separated science and theology.  So, Dembski's thoughts are aligned to the path of this group and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Other modern scientists went on a different path by claiming that science cannot consider a supernatural being into any scientific investigation.  The Enlightenment makes this claim.  This claim is a major error in science because the existence of a supernatural being, which is God, can be proven scientifically.  Further, science can prove that God and the universe are connected logically, that is, with dipolar concepts of panentheism.<br /><br />With respect to intelligent design, Demoski shows us that chance and natural law are not excluded middle opposites.  Intelligent designs(many of them)lie in between chance, the flip of a coin, and natural laws.  Among these designs is the design the 'best' universe by God.  On the development of intelligent design, Dembski is thus again on the path of the above group of Cusanus followers and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Dembski's theory of information is new.  If one assumes that information is the content of a communication system, then one can conclude that God is communicating information to us through the language abilities He gave us and the many things He created.  St. Paul told us about this information at Rom. 1:18-20.<br /><br />Indeed, this book is very progressive.hings He created.  St. Paul told us about this information at Rom. 1:18-20.

Altogether, they show that evolutionary theory is magic, not science, and that intelligent design is science.<br /><br />But, the magic of evolutionary theory is not unique because evolutionary theory has spread its nonsense throughout the US.  For instance, the Big Bang theory, quarks, and strings are the magic of our atheistic physicists. Evolutionary theory has also brought to us all of the magic found in the US economic theory, most of the magic found in the US Supreme Court, lots of magic found in our educational system, and the magic produced by the US justice system.<br /><br />The magicians of today's magic in the USA are coming from (1) the unconstitutional separation of State and God and (2) the separation of science and theology by those scientists who have not yet learned that any universe of finite things is not possible without a creator God.  The first scientific proof of God's existence has been found recently and will show that these magicss are false.  With this proof, even `chance' is turned into magic.  In a universe of finite things, we will find  absolute truths and relative truths.  One absolute truth is found in the biochemical irreducible complexities spoken of by Behe and in the physical laws found by physical scientists.  And, relative truths will be found in the probabilities spoken of by Dembski or in those irreducible complexities that can become more complex for long term purposes (adaptations, etc.).<br /><br />This team of thinkers is on a very productive path that can be expected to expose important intelligent designs of God. If this team continues to expand research in biochemistry, we can expect to hear long-awaited medical news on cancer and perhaps news on a fusion energy furnace.<br /><br />It might be time for the 'authorities' of the magics above to rethink their scientific positions, admit their errors and ask for forgiveness, or retire.<br /><br />Although all chapters of this book are very interesting,Chapters 7 and 12 are important because they show some basic signs of God's design of the universe.<br /><br />This book is needed by all parents who need advice to protect their children from destroying their minds in school.awaited medical news on cancer and perhaps news on a fusion energy furnace.

It  raises many questions about the field of biology, the evolutionary theory proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, the theory of design, and the theory of intelligent design.  The author discusses many designs that range from Rube Goldberg designs, through complex biochemical designs, and to the design of Nature by God.<br /><br />This discussion is very different than the discussion of those `Carl Sagan-like' evolutionists who promote evolutionary theory as a fact.  No fact is theory neutral.  Thus, when one says that evolution is a FACT, FACT, FACT... that person is not a scientist.<br /><br />Unless biologists begin to conduct real scientific research on the theory of evolution, the  educational agencies of the US government will continue to build educational systems that produce dummies who are trained to seek and follow `authorities' rather than the truth.<br /><br />Clearly, this book is required reading for any godly person who wants to become active in the debates against the godless ideas of `self-claimed' and `publish or perish' authorities.	2005-06-29

People who believe in God should not miss this latest report on panentheism and how it is unifying science and theology.<br /><br />In the Greek language, pan-en-theism means 'all' is 'in' God. Panentheism also means that God is more than all of the things God creates.  Thus, the God of panentheism cannot be exhausted, even if He creates eternally.<br /><br />With panentheism, the true infinity of God is being revealed. With God's true infinity, God and His creation are related logically.  So, even though God and His creation are distinct, they are intertwined and not separated.<br /><br />Panentheism was named for the first time in Germany by Karl Christian Friedrich Krause in 1829.  This name reflects the increasing human force that is unifying science and theology today. With the work of scientists on God's intelligent design and man's intelligent designs, scientists and theologians are getting closer and closer.  In time, panentheism might simply mean 'scientific theism.'<br /><br />I found the editors and contributors to be very open thinkers and seem to be great teachers.  However, as a reader of the works of Nicholas of Cusa, I hoped to read more comparisons between Nicholas' panentheism and the panentheism of others.<br /><br />This book is the kind of book that will start a revolution on the subject of panentheism.<br /><br />On June 27, 2010, I posted a blog that identifies seventeen 'big thinkers' on my website at [...].  They add many thoughts on the subject of panentheism.	2005-06-22

Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution Is Wrong	Books	5	12	41	N	Y	The End of Evolutionary Theory	I began to do research on the theory of evolution while I was developing a modern creation theory.  My modern creation theory goes beyond the creation theory of Moses and the Old Testament and focuses on modern science and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />The author of Icons of Evolution shortened my research on evolution theory considerably because he shows quickly and thoroughly that many evolutionists have become actors of a stage show and gatekeepers of false biological ideas that are taught to new students today.  Apparently, these evolutionists have lost their respect for the truth.<br /><br />I conclude that these actors and gatekeepers find themselves on this path because no truths will be found to support this theory.  Truths will not be found in evolutionary theory for two reasons: (1) because evolutionary theory is a godless theory and (2) because creation theory has been confirmed recently by modern science.  Biology is thus in the same position with its concepts of ancestors as the physical scientists, who cannot find a system of physical atoms.  The modern creation theory has no biological ancestors and no physical atoms. The difference between physical science and evolution theory is that physical scientists are building their science on quantity and quality whereas evolutionist are building evolution on the meanings of words and logic.<br /><br />This book must be studied by concerned people throughout the world because the field of biology, the field of physical science, and the field of human science are dragging the people of all nations into one big and stinky sewer of lies.	2005-05-20

There, it says that 'our sense-data are primarily symbolic.'  This anouncement informs us of a new problem, the problem of meaning.<br /><br />Physical scientist missed this announcement because they found that six fundamental physical quantities --- electric charge, temperature, mass, length, time duration, and angle --- and secondary quantities (e.g., density) form many physical laws.  Fortunately, the meanings of all physical symbols come with the physical laws of nonliving things.  The symbols in these laws define each other, just like a pair of opposites define each other.<br /><br />Unfortunately, physical scientists claim that living things also come from nonliving things. This is not true because they make this claim because they do not believe in God. However, my 2005 scientific proof of God proves that living things do not come from nonliving things. Since God exists, one will learns that living things are spiritual/physical things.<br /><br />Since other fields of science deal with living things, the problem of meaning becomes very important to them.  However, these other fields missed the above announcement also.  Thus, they give meaning to symbols using either Aristotle's concept of definition or the meanings given by the pgysical sciences physical things. I believe that most social scientists use Aristotle's method of definition.  And, biologists, medical doctors, and evolutionists hang onto the meanings of the symbols that come from physical science because they assume that living things come from nonliving things.<br /><br />I urge physical scientists, mathematicians, biologists, medical doctors and evolutionists to consider God as a reality.  I especially urge medical doctors and the National Institutes of Health to stop creating the mechanical drugs that kill patients.<br /><br />Since God is now proven to exist, I conclude that the field of science is lost and will remain that way until they find God.So, this book will become increasingly important to people as they learn the truth about God.they find God.So, this book will become increasingly important to people as they learn the truth about God.	2005-04-30

On Pages 1 and 2, Wang tells us that Godel, the master of the incomplete, suggests the possibility of philosophy as an exact theory emerging within the next hundred years or even sooner.  There will be, he believes, scientific disproofs of what he calls' mechanism in biology' and of the proposition that 'there is no mind separate from matter'; moreover he thinks it practically certain that the 'physical laws, in their observable consequences, have a finite limit of precision.  In his conversations, he recommends the important project of finding what might be called a 'rational religion.'    I conclude that exact philosophy already exists because theological statements are being proven, even though the ultimate truth will always be incomplate.  This prediction means that the scientific method cannot be used to prove worlds, which is a box in which we live.  Thus, universe cannot be measured without measure standards. So the universe is relativistic and can never be known exactly.  I also agree with Godel that mechanisms will never be found in living things.  This is why US medical care is so bad.  I agree with Godel that minds will never be without bodies because only organizations exist in Nature.  I also agree with Godel that a rational religion is coming because theological statements are being proven.	2005-04-11

However, knowing his contribution is difficult to assemble because Leibniz published only one book during his life.  Yet, he was a prolific writer of papers and letters to many people on many subject.  Beside discovering the infinitesimal calculus, which is taught is all high schools today, he was known as a 'walking encyclopedia.'<br /><br />The material in this book was made by Leibniz in response to England's John Locke's 'Essay Concerning Human Understanding' (1690).  The material was prepared by Leibniz to use it in a debate with Locke.  Locke proposed physical atoms for the universe.  This is consistent with Newton's physical universe.  But, Leibniz proposed monads, which are becoming part of modern creation theories.  However, Locke died and the debate never occurred.  Instead, Leibniz established correspondence in 1715-16 with Samuel Clark, a disciple of Isaac Newton.  This correspondence is an excellent summary of Leibniz's thoughts before he died in 1716. It shows the basic differences between Newton and Leibniz in both science and mathematics.<br /><br />This book should become part of the home library of any intellectual family.	2005-04-06

For a book on empiricism, see Dunn, John with J.O. Urmson, and A.J.Ayer (1992) \\"The British Empiricists;\\" New York: Oxford University Press.  Kant tried to solve this debate with his Critique of Pure Reasoning. But, Kant failed.<br /><br />The debate came to an end when a number of linguists discovered (in the 1920s) that 'empirical data are primarily symbolic.'  This discovery says that facts are not theory neutral.  So, even police facts must be challenged to be sure that police theories of a crime agree with the crime facts. The same is true about a newspaper or TV report.<br /><br />This book on Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz does not discuss the nature of rationalism and how it fits in the development of knowledge.  I also found this book to be short on the thoughts of Leibniz, who challenged Newton's physical world.  I recommend that readers expand their knowledge of Leibniz's work by seeking other sources of information. Including Leibniz's monadology in this book was important because his monads are becoming important in the current developments of modern creation theories.	2005-04-05

This reissue is timely because Hartshorne passed on in 2000.  The reissue is also timely because Americans still do not understand dialectical thinking, the early dialecticians such as Plato and Nicholas of Cusa, the modern thinking in Germany today, modern  panentheism, and modern dialecticians such as Charles Hartshorne.  The Marxists also became dialecticians.  But, they end up with a one-sided world because they turned away from God.  Far East thinkers also became dialecticians.  But, they turned to a mechanistic whole for the world and miss the spiritual activity of God through Christ.<br /><br />However, Americans will not gain this understanding until they limit the use of Aristotle's logic to subjects of Nature and stop using logic to describe God. This limit and stoppage is a complex language transformation and could take a few generations because Aristotle and British empiricism dominated the English language for many centuries. However, the material in this book will accelerate this transformation, especially if the reader reads the book several times and changes the color of underlines, marks, etc. with each readings. Multiple readings are important for any new material.  Obviously, readings of Plato and Nicholas of Cusa will also help one understand the messages in this book by Hartshorne and Reese.<br /><br />Panentheism and this book can expect to increase our knowledge of the God who appears in our world.	2005-02-24

His philosophical work must have been widely accepted because he was honored by the Library of Living Philosophers in Vol XX.  He studied Anselm for a long time having written his thesis at Harvard in 1923 on  the \\"Ontological Argument Invented by Anselm.\\"  The Argument was issued by Anselm at about 1070 AD.  So, if one wants to judge Anselm's work on the \\"Ontological Proof for God's Existence,\\" this book is a great one from a great philosopher. This popular and important 1965 book was printed again in 1991<br /><br />Anselm shows that we cannot prove that God does not exist beause we cannot conceive of things that do not exist.  So, when people say that God does not exist, they are entering a domain of thought that is uncertain.  A more certain path lies with reasoning.<br /><br />For instance, with reasoning, Anselm concludes that God's existence is necessary and that ordinary existences apply only to things found in the universe. I believe that his line of reasoning goes this way: if the existence of things in the universe are ordinary, they either exist or do not exist.  In modern science, these ordinary existences would be known as contingent existences.  But, contingent has no meaning without its opposite, necessity.  Thus, unless contingent eisistences coexist with a necesary existent, a one-sided universe is being conceived. Anselm's line of reasoning seems to move his thoughts into dialectical thinking, panentheism, and an eternal world consisting of God and Nature.<br /><br />The author shows why nine centuries of refutations produced many errors in comprehending Anselm's writing. For six centuries, Anselm's Proof was simply ignored.  But, in the next three centuries, fifteen authors cite the Proof and ten of them accept his proof.<br /><br />So, this book is important to believers in God.	2005-02-03

Leibniz's Monadology : An Edition for Students	Books	5	3	8	N	N	Leibniz's Monads: Spiritual Atoms of the Universe	This important book by Rescher translates and discusses the spiritual atoms (or monads) that were developed in the 17th century by Gottfried Leibniz.  The monads are part of the thoughts that Leibniz was having on the least action principle, his famous infinitesimal calculus, his theory of minute perceptions, and his universal characteristics for science.<br /><br />Leibniz expected to use his indivisible monads to challenge the divisible and physical atoms proposed by England's John Locke for Newton's mechanical universe.  But, Locke died before the debate could take place.  Leibniz eventually debated with Newton through Samuel Clarke in 1715-16.  But Leibniz died in 1716 and the monads died with his death.  Today, the monads are being offered as alternatives to the chemical atoms found in the Periodic Chart of chemistry books and the string theories being developed in the school of physics.  The indivisible monads of Leibniz are being considered because the chemical atoms and strings are divisible objects and are thus not atoms.<br /><br />Since the monads are indivisible, Leibniz can be connected to Nicholas of Cusa and Georg Cantor, who worked with indivisibles.  Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo also worked with Cusa's indivisibles.  I am writing a book on the unification of science and theology and will include Leibniz's monads in a new creation theory.  Rescher's book is necessary reading for all godly scientists who reject the Big Bang theory, evolutionary theory, and string theories.	2005-01-25

This hope would unify the fields of science and theology. Currently, these fields are separated by their different beliefs and methods of truth seeking. On beliefs, many scientists do not believe in God whereas all theologians believe in God. On truths, scientists use the scientific method to express true scientific statements whereas theologians use feelings, phenomena, and scriptures to express true theological statements.<br /><br />I believe that all `big discoveries' unify 'that which is physical' with 'that which is spiritual.'  For instance, the big discovery of Nicholas of Cusa unifies an infinite God and our finite universe. And, the big discovery of Leibniz unifies spiritual atoms with all physical things in the universe. Further, the big 1920 discovery of symbolic languages allows us to speak about God and the universe using the same symbolic language. In this book on Cantor, one earns that the mathematics and infinities of Georg Cantor is another `big discovery' that unifies God and the universe.<br /><br />Cantor's theory of the infinity reveals two infinities. One is the `non-genuine' infinite. This infinity is incomplete. It applies to variable magnitudes in the universe, as they either grow beyond all limits or diminishes to an arbitrary smallness. This infinity always remains finite. Cantor's transfinite numbers orders and counts all non-genuine infinities. On the other hand, the `genuine' infinity is determinate, unchanging, and complete. It is found in the complex variables used by scientists. There, the determinate infinity is the single point at infinity. Complex variables in the neighborhood of this single point are thus analytical. The genuine infinity is also used by theologians to represent God.<br /><br />It is obvious that organized research on these big discoveries must be increased considerably by all nations. To start organizing this research effort, I am writing a book on symbolic languages and the big discoveries of Cusa, Leibniz, and Cantor.ies must be increased considerably by all nations.

It is necessary reading for all believers in God.<br /><br />Today, some religions, most physical scientists, and most biologists do not believe in reincarnation because they believe that our world comes to an end.  Religions speak of this end with their studies of  eschatology.  And, physical scientists and biologists speak of this end as the result of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.  Unfortunately, such religions, physical scientists, and biologists are obviously unaware of modern discoveries that would change their beliefs.  One  discovery is by Nicholas of Cusa.  He proves  that our world is finite and thus that its origin must be an infinite thing.  The second discovery is by Georg Cantor.  He proves that two infinities exist -- a completed infinity and an uncompleted infinity.  These two discoveries tell us  (1) that God created our world (2) that God is a completed infinity, (3) that our world is an uncompleted infinity, and (4) that God and our world are eternal.  Reincarnation is consistent with these discoveries.<br /><br />Further, physicists have not found the atoms of our world. To search for the atoms, they are developing string theories.  But, all strings are finite and can thus be divided endlessly.  So, string theories will not expose the atoms of our world.  They are also developing a world theory known as the Big Bang theory.  They claim that our world has its origin in a physical thing that explodes.  But, they have no proof of this physical thing.  Today, these atomic and world theories are merely imaginations of  physicists who reject God as the origin of our world.<br /><br />A spiritual atom was found by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century.  Since they are immortal, they can be created and destroyed only by God, just as energy in our world cannot be created and destroyed.  Some of thee spiritual atoms are human souls.  They are thus eternal are reincarnate.  So, this book is very important.  If this book is reprinted, I hope an index is included for scientists.<br /><br />Currently, I am writing a book that will discuss the new discoveries above and the spiritual atoms.

This book and supporting books by Cusa are on the subject of God and a new creation theory.  His theory is very different than Moses' Genesis and the three interpretations of the Genesis covered by Numbers.  Why didn't Numbers include Cusa's new theory in this book?  I speculate that Numbers was unaware of this new creation theory because it became available in the US only in 1979.  Further, the title Cusa chose for his major book was not appropriate to modern researchers who use computer search engines daily.<br /><br />Cusa's theism challenges some Church teaching. For instance, his God is infinite and his creation is finite; the universe has no center;  all creatures are images of God; and God, the creation, and the Trinity are eternal.  As seen, his creation theory is a major challenge to the evolutionary theory promoted today.  Because of his challenges, Cusa's new theory took the slow path to the world book market, but through big personalities such as Galileo. Kepler, Bruno, Leibniz, and Cantor.<br /><br />Today, the many writings of Cusa are becoming popular on the Internet with the help of the American Cusanus Society.  I am writing a modern science book that features Cusa.  Hopefully, the author of The Creationists and others take a look at the new creation theory of Cusa.	2005-01-22

The world is certainly in trouble as the author demonstrates so well. As a scientist, I believe that this excellent social science work by Ruppert is unique and shows the great work that our police detectives are doing.  He proves that social science need not be a statistical game. He shows that social relations act like physical relations when the social relations involve conspiracies.  Those people who say that conspiracies do not exist should think a bit deeper.<br /><br />But, the US government knew about this trouble when our high school teachers told us in the 1940s that the oil would be depleted near the end of the 20th century.  Why didn't our leaders act before?  The answer is clear -- our leaders seek only power.  Instead, of developing fusion energy, as Lyndon LaRouche has suggested continuously over the last 25 years, government put him in jail illegally to silence his message.  With fusion energy, the oil could have been saved for oil's more important uses.<br /><br />Ruppert's great book seems to be the first of many \\"WOW\\" books that are in the stream.  Now that science and theology are working together, the lies of our religions will also be revealed. One religious WOW-book is the \\"Farewell to Eden\\" by Duwayne Anderson.  He shows that the Book of Morman was fabricated by Joseph Smith with lies.  All scriptures will now be challenged.	2004-10-26

This scripture was written in the 19th century by Joseph Smith and is named  the Book of Mormon.  This scripture contains extractions from the Bible (Old Testament and New Testament) and sayings by Smith.  Its purpose was to start a new American religion based on revelation, with prophets and apostles who speak directly to God, and to prepare Israel for the second coming of Christ.  Smith became the first Mormon prophet and president.  Brigham Young was a Mormon prophet and president.<br /><br />This book is important to the fields of science and religion because Farewell to Eden is a precursor of other challenges of Western world scriptures (Avesta, Old Testament, New Testament, and Qur'an).  Undoubtedly, these other scriptures can expect challenges because all ancient scriptures have falsities.  All scriptures contain (1) falsities related to God and the creation and include (2) falsities that help to build a faith.  Falsities that develop fear is used to promote followers by founders or leaders of a faith.<br /><br />The author tells us that Smith erred when he made his God all-knowing.  To give God all-knowledge, God is first a finite human and then with self-knowledge He develops all-knowledge.  Smith's infinity is Aristotle's infinity (e.g., 1,2,3,...etc).  The autyhor is thus correct because, in the 15th century, Nicholas of Cusa showed that infinite and finite are not comparable.  So, any finite thing cannot become infinite in any way.  A monotheistic God is infinite and exists prior to the creation.  Other scriptures also view a monotheistic God as something finite, for instance, when they place a celestial world in between God and His creation and add beings such as Satan, demons, etc.<br /><br />Fear is often added to a scripture by including words saying that God gives rewards and punishes people by ending our world and creating a Heaven, for rewards, and a Hell, for punishments. Today's Middle East suicide bombers are filled with this fear.<br /><br />I agree with the author when he implies at p. 315 that God is eternal, life is eternal, life after death is eternal, the creation is eternal, and families are eternal.<br /><br />The author does a brilliant job of applying many dfifferent sciences to explain why the Book of Mormon is filled with errors and that Joseph Smith was merely a story teller.  However, I do not believe that Mormons should disorganize because all churches have major scriptural problems.  All churches should continue their current social interactions, as the author would want.  Simultaneously, all churches can slowly reorganize their thoughts about God and the creation.  I recommend that they start this reorganization by considering the writings of Nicholas of Cusa.Heaven, for rewards, and a Hell, for punishments.

New translations of Cusanus writings began to appear in the late 1970s by Jasper Hopkins of the University of Minnesota.  Free copies of some of Hopkins translations are available on the Internet at [...]  Today, translations of these 15th century writings are also being made by the American Cusanus Society.  The author of this book is past president of this society.<br /><br />The writings of Nicholas of Cusa are significant because his writings, on God and our world, initiated the modern world in which we live today.  To me, his writings are the most important religious writings to be found on amazon.com today.  His writing will help people transform the out-dated ancient views of God and our world they have been taught into modern views  supported by modern science.  Without this transformation, a person becomes conservative with a closed mind and will not understand the natural changes that are taking place among liberal and open-minded people.<br /><br />This book is a necessary addition to any home or public library.  It is necessary by any person who is working on the unification of science and theology.  And, it is necessary for any person who believes that a pure spiritual/modern world is possible beyond the materialistic-driven spiritual/modern world in which we live today today.	2004-09-25

At the convention, President Bush presented over 15 vote-getting initiatives that would be offered in his second term.  Based on Bush's speech and Kerry's book, these two men are as different as night and day.  But this difference can be seen in Kerry's well written book, which shows the basic difference between the Republican Party and Democratic Party.<br /><br />This basic difference has its origin in the two principles that Abe Lincoln used to declare the Civil War.  One principle is \\"freedom\\" and the other is \\"union.\\"  Lincoln gave freedom to all Americans with the Emancipation Proclamation.  And, Lincoln held the union together as the USA, just as the Constitution mandated government to \\"to form a more perfect Union.\\"  Kerry's book shows that Republicans are working only for freedom but that Democrats are working for both freedom and union.<br /><br />Thus, it is clear that the purpose of governmental spending (or taxing) by a Democratic administration is to expand freedom and perfect the USA. Examples of the perfection of the union are FDR's New Deal, Truman's Marshall Plan,  LBJ's Great Society, JFK's high technology space program/Cold War, and Clinton's Third Way globalization.  And, it is also clear that the purpose of governmental spending (or taxing) by a Republican administration is to expand freedom and support a trickle-down economy.  But, such an economy does not work.  ( See report by Kennickell, Arthur B. and R. Louise Woodburn (April 1992) \\"Estimation of Household net Worth Using Model-Based and design-Based Weights: Evidence from the 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances;\\"  and Kennickell, Arthur B., Douglas A.

But this is a new view of God and God's creation through the eye of Nicholas of Cusa who uses negative theology to (1) know the creation and (2) understand God, simultaneously. With this unified view of God and God's creation, God becomes truly absolute because a monotheistic God must create out of nothing and thus has no oppositions.<br /><br />In this new view of a monotheistic God, the good/evil religious dualism, which is currently used by Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, must be replaced by the identity/difference religious dualism. The  ontology of \\"identity is, in fact, the Christian Trinity and the ontology of \\"difference\\"is, in fact, the creation taught by St. Paul at Rom. 1:20. Since a true monotheistic God has no opposing forces, God is not jealous.  Nor can opposing forces such as Satan, Devil, demons, and fallen angels exist. Accordingly, love, not fear, becomes the new relationship between God and Man<br /><br />The true creation of a monotheistic God turns out to be a holistic theophany.  In this new creation theory, the creation is eternal and has no end.  This implies that the immortality of man is a natural process and that evolutionary theory is false.  In Cusa's creation, God reveals Himself through contracted images of Himself. These images are infinite in God and are contracted by God with plurality and finitude. Since God creates out of nothing, God is thus found in all creature, that is, in a way that God is all actual creatures.<br /><br />This book must be read by all godly persons.	2004-08-20

It has lots of data.  On style, we knew that he could speak well and communicate.  Now, we also know that he communicates well with the pen.  This is a great read.<br /><br />He deals with philosophy.  As a researcher, I tested the book's index to determine his philosophy.  He seems to reject Plato, based on a class he took at Georgetown.  But, he doesn't speak of Plato's opposition, Aristotle.  So, the questions \\"what is knowledge\\" and \\"how is knowledge produced\\" are unanswered.<br /><br />He discusses The Third Way.  The Third Way is a political philosophy that would operate in between the opposites, democracy and socialism.  This has great potentials for all humans worldwide.  He was developing this political philosophy with Tony Blair, et al, while he was still President. He discusses this new political philosophy often and identifies other people who are working on it.  I hope that he continues his thoughts and acts on developing the Third Way.<br /><br />On economics, President Clinton's efforts against a balanced budget, which is standard goal of Republicans, should be respected by anyone who reads the Preamble of the Constitution and the phrase, \\"... In Order to form a more perfect Union.\\"  A balanced budget cannot produce a more perfect Union.  Instead, it produces economic equilibrium and an economy that oscillates around the equilibrium point.  Only sharp monetary game players win with an equilibrating economy.	2004-08-01

The New Testament and this book on the Gospel of Thomas tell us that the teachings of Jesus are not simple as Christian fundamentalists teach.  Meyer has done a great job.  And, Bloom's reading is a wonderful addition to this book.<br />My analysis of the New Testament concludes that some of Jesus' teachings are simple.  But, the New Testament has at least two other classes of sayings that are not simple.  These other classes deal with the development of the human mind and the development of God's kingdom.  Thus, unless one is trained with today's scientific literature on the mind and modern creation theories, one will understand only about one-third of Jesus' sayings in the New Testament and in the Gospel of Thomas.  Clearly, Christians untrained in science and mathematics are making too many guesses relative the truths about the sayings of Jesus.<br />The Gospel of Thomas, like the New Testament and the Hubble telescope,is more proof that Nature has no apocalyptic end.  Thus, the only new world that people can expect after death is the world that Nature's law of reincarnation gives them.<br />The Gospel of Thomas is an excellent addition to the New Testament because they have many simularities and can thus be  compared. This is a good book to have in any home.	2004-03-18

But, this story will remain incomplete until &quot;the fat lady sings.&quot;  The fat lady is the Roman Catholic Church and the song is the 1440 negative theology of Bishop Nicholas of Cusa.  Negative theology, which is described in Cusa's book &quot;On Learned Ignorance,&quot; landed in the USA only in 1981.  It was translated by Dr. Jasper Hopkins of the University of Minnesota.  And, it was published by The Arthur J. Banning Press in Minneapolis. It is now in paperback from amazon.com.<br />Stoyanov had to conduct considerable research on the subject of religious dualism to bring us his great story.  Now, I hope a new story is told in a similar way.  This new story would include the religious dualism discovered by Bishop Cusa.  Unfortunately, Cusa's new religious dualism was also silemced by the Roman Church.  When are Christian churches going to grow up and open up?  Jesus Christ will not be defeated, even by junk movies such as created by Mel Gibson.  Cusa defeats the God/Satan dualism and Gibson's promotion of the Original Sin of Christianity with his new identity/difference dualism.  All good forces, on the side of God, and all evil forces, on the side of Satan, can be rejected.  The battles between good and evil forces in a celestial world, or a supernatural world, are foolish imaginations of people who are unaware of Cusa's identity/difference dualism.	2004-03-01

A dualism is created when a human thinks about two antagonistic principles such as God/Satan, good/evil, light/darkness, mind/body, etc.  Markale is a teacher. People who are beginners on the subject of dualism will certainly benefit from Markale's rather simple style of writing.  Markale's book focuses on the dualisms used by the Carthars.  The thought of the Cathars are very similar to the thoughts of Christians.  Unfortunately, the thoughts of the Cathars were silenced by the Inquisition.<br />I recommend this book because the current good/evil dualism of Christianity is being rejected rapidly by keen Christians.  This failing dualism of Christianity, which is also known as Original Sin, is the good/evil story of Adam and Eve told by Moses in the Genesis.  Along with the rapid rejection of this Christian dualism, the Christian theory of eschatology will also be rejected by these keen Christians.  The loss of the Christian theory of eschatology means that our world has no end, which means that Heaven and Hell are false ideas.  All Christian should consider this book in order to prepare for the radical changes that are certain to come in Christianity soon.	2004-02-28

She has produced a great book with lots of ideas and lots of data.  We need more like her even if errors are made.  Errors are found in every good dialogue.  These errors are corrected naturally as the dialogue proceeds.  In her words, I learned of something very human and beautiful ' the huge amounts of love that reside in the Muslim mind.<br /><br /> The debates between monarchism and free states are thousands of years old and are amplified today with the debates between conservatives and liberals.  Thus, one cannot expect these debate to end without continued discussion.  So, let Irshad Manji express her thoughts.  We need as much thought as we can get on both sides of these debates and by both sexes.  The days of trying to silence people for expressing their thoughts is out-dated and an indication of the degeneration of the repressor's MINDSET.<br /><br /> However, debates among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam could fade away fast after the spiritual atoms (or monads) of Gottfried Leibniz are applied to God's creation and revealed to the general population.  With spiritual atoms, all forces in the holistic universe are based on love relations.  All things in the universe will be understood only with infinite sets and the transfinite numbers of Georg Cantor.  When God empowers and enlightens things in the universe through spiritual atoms, all metaphysical theories and all higher celestial worlds are rejected. And, God becomes the only higher world. Mediators (angels demons, etc.) no longer exist because God has secured His communications to us through the new atoms.  With spiritual atoms, revealed religions become figments of one's imaginations. This new atomic creation theory describes Nature as an eternal and non-linear continuum. Heaven and Hell are gone and reincarnation is in. Obviously, the new theory goes well beyond Moses creation theory.  It will become public soon.<br /><br /> Of possible interest to Muslims is a 15th century paper on the Koran.  Specifically, in 1461, Bishop Nicholas of Cusa of the Roman Church made an interesting report in response to a request by Pope Pius II for information on the Koran.

In his report, Cusa speaks of three very crafty Jews who attached themselves to Muhammad in order to avert him.  After Muhammad's death, Cusa reports that these Jews approached Alis, the son of Abitalip, to whom Muhammad had bequeathed his collection of writings.

But, it is not the time to think only about retiring from the job, sitting on your duff at home, and waiting for your death and a new life in Heaven or Hell.  If reincarnation is true, there is no after life in Heaven or Hell and no end of the world in which God created for us.  So, more people ought to open discussion on reincarnation.  And this book is a great one to guide such a discussion.<br />Reincarnation is real to me already because reincarnation is consistent with many new and more powerful ideas that are coming online in the field of religion soon.  For instance, the good/evil religious dualism will soon be replaced by the identity/difference religious dualism. The new dualism identifies the eternal partnership between God and man. This means that the idea of Original Sin in Christianity is false. Also, the idea that the creation will end is also false.  The idea of ending this immense universe and creating new opposing worlds for good and evil people will sell only to ignorantnt people. Further, a new creation theory based on atoms will soon be proposed.  With atoms, God's Wisdom and power enters only  through the atoms.  Thus, say good-bye to the idea of a celestial world above us and its chimera such as Satan, demons, etc. They were merely creations of under-developed human minds.  The new ideas are showing that our unlimited God did create human co-creators who have serious responsibilities, who will be fruitful, multiply and subdue Nature, and who will live forever.  No person will ever be lost in the new theologies and new sciences that are coming.  Laws of reinarnation are natural.  Thus, reincarnation is not an intervention process of God.  These laws should be identified with the new atomic theory because our immortal spirits, which are our invisible minds, are among the atoms.<br />Since God is infinite and his creation is finite, the relationship between God and man or God and Nature cannot be known with discursive reasoning.  To bridge this gap, the author believes that finite things are in God. He thus accepts monism, which must reject the religious dualism Christianity. I believe in the dualism of Christianity, but not the good/evil dualism.<br />With the new ideas I discuss above and with reincarnation, I expect Christianity to become highly rational, in the image of our God, who is pure reasoning.  I thus expect Christianity to grow unbelievably in the near future.<br />This is a good book.
