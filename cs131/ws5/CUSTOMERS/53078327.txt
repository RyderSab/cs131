This time out, Nina's case comes from a masseuse who wants Nina to help her uncle, whose wife was shot during a robbery in a motel, in return for free massage therapy.  Nina doesn't take the deal, but does take the uncle as a client.<br /><br />Add to the mix three rather bizarre mathematicians who were cheating casinos by, simplistically, counting cards at the blackjack tables.  There is much written about prime numbers and various other mathematical theories and while commendable that the O'Shaughnessy sisters understand these, they certainly don't add to the book in any way.  I rocked with the first foray into college math 1A, but by the continuation of the \\"class,\\" I was seriously skimming through it.<br /><br />These little asides seemed to slow the book considerably.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the sisters since reading their first book, but this one leaves a bit to be desired and is not up to their usual 4-5 star rating.  In a nutshell, I really didn't care who murdered whom or why before I was halfway through the book. I finished it out of mild curiosity and the hope that it would get better soon.<br /><br />Perhaps Paul was the glue/stability that held the previous storylines together, perhaps Nina needs to \\"get a grip and stop dithering,\\" perhaps this series is running out of gas - whatever the reason, this is not a must read or even a must buy.	2005-07-24

Mr. Johnson cleverly weaves the stories of these individual brothers into an entertaining tale.<br /><br />William, a psychologist attending the Annual Psychological Convention is sabotaged at dinner by his four white associates who want answers to racial questions.  Their pointed questions bring up his own prejudices as he finds himself in love with one of his white associates.<br /><br />Sterling, an attorney who is fired from his prestigious law firm just as he wins the biggest case of his life.  He is fired for street talking in the office, but lands on his feet when a very wealthy woman offers to set him up in a new office with clients, help in becoming a sports agent, and a million dollars. All he has to do in return is insure that the pregnant girlfriend, who is black, of this woman's son, who is white and on the presidential track, gets an abortion and accepts 5 million dollars never to see her son again.<br /><br />Then we have Jericho, the eldest and the black sheep of the family - no pun intended.  He owns a hotel and casino in the Cayman Islands, but he also is a drug and munitions supplier with CIA connections.  He is having a few problems with the government and rival gangs, for lack of a better word. Jericho is a violent, in your face force, but adds much excitement to the story.<br /><br />Mr. Johnson conjures marvelously diverse, yet believable characters and puts them in a storyline with just enough twists and turns to keep the reader highly entertained.<br /><br />The street talk became a little overdone for me, but I am a white person and perhaps that is my prejudice.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good story yet simultaneously thought provoking with differing views on interracial relationships that will have you examining your own prejudices.	2005-05-30

In my humble opinion, Harlan Coben is one of today's best mystery and thriller writers and stands above all of the rest.  I agree with another reviewer who said that Harlan on a bad day is still better than many on their best days.<br /><br />Having said that, The Innocent, wasn't Mr. Coben's greatest endeavor to date.  While still a page turner, his novels are becoming formulaic and you just expect twists and turns.<br /><br />This is a story of a guy(Matt)who was convicted of murder, spending 4 years in jail when, in actuality, it was an accidental killing and \\"our hero\\" was just trying to stop a barroom brawl.  Usually I can go with Mr Coben's flights of fantasy, but he lost me right here, in the beginning.  Matt's family could afford a good lawyer and in today's world, Matt would be a lawyer himself \\"with a past.\\"  Matt's wife has a past of her own unknown to Matt.  Using the old picture in a cell phone trick, Coben is off to the races and doesn't stop until the last page. The pace is fast, there are some surprising twists (although I had many of them figured out), but I never did \\"warm up\\" to the characters.  The truth of the matter is that while I certainly wanted to see what happened, I really didn't care enough about the characters for it to matter if the ending was happy or not.<br /><br />From another author, this would be a very good story.  From Harlan Coben, it is only good.	2005-05-21

She and her sexy partner, Kelly McPherson, think they have solved the gruesome killings only to find other victims with nothing apparently connecting the victims to each other.<br /><br />Sugar and Spice is a great story, filled with intrigue, twists and turns with every page.  I found it impossible to put down.  Just like Special Agent Perry, every time I thought I had it all figured out, I discovered I was very wrong.  There are new surprises with every page.<br /><br />This is a great read. I predict Mr Johnson will soon become one of the top mystery writers.	2005-03-15
US	53078327	RHXFBHCJ4N046	1593090188	483219340	Pretenses	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Great Story	Reminiscent of the TV show 24, Special Agent Phoenix Perry is having a very bad day and more.  First there is a serial rapist running about raping men.  He has been doing this for over 2 years - but no one knew as none of the victims reported the crime.  As if this weren't enough for your average writer, enter Coco Nimburu, a trained Ninja, master of disguise,  speaks a million languages, and a top notch hired assassin. Her only downfall appears to be that she is something of a sex addict.  Phoenix, who is also a grandmastger of Shaolin Kung Fu, may have met her match.<br /><br />There begins a gripping story of intrigue, betrayals, people who aren't who they appear to be.....just about anything a reader of mystery and adventure would want.  All rolled into one story.<br /><br />I will admit that it took me a few pages to become accustomed to Mr. Johnson's writing style, but the story soon overcame any problems in that area.  The author does a great job in telling a story and developing the main characters.  I felt as if Phoenix was a friend and I even developed an understanding of Coco and liked her - except for the little matter of her choice of professions.<br /><br />This is a good read by an author I know we will hear more and more about as time goes on.  Give the book a try, it is worth it.	2005-03-13

There is nothing happy, uplifting, or even conclusive in this latest Cornwell offering.  Looking for an ending?  Looking for a continuation of Blow Fly?  Not even close.  Blow Fly never happened and this novel has no particular ending. It is like Cornwell just stopped writing, said the end, and moved on to book #14.<br /><br />We have Scarpetta returning to Richmond.  Why, one wonders?  Even Scarpetta can't answer that question.  There ensues a typical Cornwell plot - working on the same case as Lucy and Benton, one side keeping as tight-lipped as the other.  Scarpetta is charged with helping her totally inept and seriously neurotic replacement solve the death of a 14 year old girl.  Meanwhile, Lucy and Benton are trying to understand who is stalking her and attempted to murder Lucy's latest bad idea in a relationship. Does it come as any surprise that the two plots are related? Rudi has lost all patience with Lucy and Marino continues to pine over Scarpetta.  I've lost patience with the whole group and have decided I no longer care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />This novel is entirely too dysfunctional and too depressing. Save your money, read the synopsis, and hope there is an ending eventually.  That is what I intend to do in the future.	2005-02-23

She isn't a reality writer.  Even with the Plum series, Evanovich has become more and more slapstick with each book. Before you buy this book, you have to know that real-life characters and situations aren't going to be there.<br /><br />This new character, which one must believe will replace the Plum series and none too soon, isn't bad.  She isn't great either.<br /><br />Barney is a girl raised by a dad who owns a garage and she is most adept at fixing cars and engines.  She didn't want to continue with this kind of work, so after getting a degree in Engineering she gets a job with an insurance company.  Her brother, \\"Wild\\" Bill, is always getting into one kind of scrape or another.  This time, he appears to have fallen into a serious, if fail the world is lost problem.  Barney, as she has done all of her life, goes to Florida to help her brother and save the world in the process.  She meets a man who drives race cars for a living and calls himself NASCAR Man. Of course she does. Just knowing this much, you know that the situations are over the top and a bit out in left field.<br /><br />Barney is a classier rendition of Stephanie.  There are still the Evanovich trademarks of car chases and the humor that comes with those, strange,somewhat evil characters, and a studly romantic interest.<br /><br />This isn't the best book you will ever read - nor is it the worst.  If you are in the market for total and typical Evanovich mind candy that is occasionally laugh out loud funny, often roll the eyes and groan slapstick - then spend the $$.	2004-12-07

This book is more a trip on a slightly rolling sea....until the last few pages when you are hit by a giant wave you didn't see coming.  Pure Harlan Coben.<br />I agree with other reviewers that this latest adventure is not as outstanding as Coben's others.  Let us not forget, though, that a good Coben novel is better than 90% of other authors' great novels.<br />As I'm sure you know by now, this is a story of a happy, successful couple with two children who are blindsided by someone placing a 15 year old picture in with recently developed family snapshots.  The husband disappears, the wife searches for him, and a myriad of characters pop out of the pages from the past of both husband and wife. Both of whom have a serious past.<br />Oddly, for 2 people who have been married for years, these two know basically nothing about each other's lives before they met.  That takes a bit of a leap of faith.  Another criticism is that I really wasn't invested in the two main characters.  Coben failed to develop them to the point where I particularly cared what happened to them.  This is not to say that I didn't want to know how it all would end, because I did, and read this in one day.  Unlike Coben's past 3 novels, however, I was able to put it down for minutes at a time and go about my day.<br />Yes, some of the characters are stereotypes and the one I came to care about most was a pure Coben twist character - a woman who is in the right place at all of the wrong times and, in my opinion, was the true heroine of a story which didn't contain many, if any, heroic folk.<br />This is a story of how youthful indescretions can wreak havoc and come back to haunt you many years later with the help of a few flawed personalities.  It is definitely a must read, a good story, and an ending that made me want to go back and reread the whole story to see why I didn't see that big wave coming.at big wave coming.	2004-05-03

One more time, Harlan Coben has written a superb mystery where every page adds another totally unexpected twist.  This book didn't have as many extreme plot turns as his last, &quot;Tell No One,&quot; but it is really close.<br />As you have read, the plot revolves around poor Will, who has to be the unluckiest man in love ever.  His first love is murdered, his worshipped brother is the suspected killer and has been on the lam for 11 years, his current lover is missing.  Can things get much worse?  Of course they can because Coben makes up good stuff!!  I refuse to say any more about the story because to do so would ruin it for you.<br />Suffice to say, the different story lines become interwoven, and downright creepy.  I have followed Coben's writing since his very first novel and, in my humble opinion, he keeps getting better and better.<br />If you only read one or two novels a year, this is a don't miss for sure.  If you read hundreds of novels a year, this is one you won't forget.  &quot;Gone for Good&quot; is a great read, filled with suspense and the knowledge that Coben won't let you figure it out; he always has one more surprise up his sleeve. And the surprises just keep on coming.  Buy it, Read it, Relish it.  This book is one of the year's best!	2002-05-04

This was, without a doubt, the absolute worst book John Grisham has ever written.  I think he has rested on his laurels long enough and it is time he returned to writing exciting novels or give up the whole thing.  I know I won't buy another of his novels without reading a few reviews first.<br />The &quot;hero&quot; of this book appeared to be a bit slow witted for a professor of a top notch college.  I kept thinking he would get with the program, but he never did.  Imagine running all over the country with a rather large sum of money in garbage bags and or boxes in the trunk of your car.  That is the basics of the book; where will he hide the money next?<br />The plot was silly, the story never lived up to its potential, and the end was the worst.<br />Don't bother to buy the book.  I'm sure there are millions of folks around the country who are carrying it around in the trunk of their car and they will willingly loan it to you.	2002-03-01

This novel had more twists and turns than a mountain road.  Before you even read the first page, you might as well resign yourself to the fact that you won't move until you finish it.<br />I was somewhat disappointed to find that Mr. Coben's book was not about Myron Bolitar as I had become very fond of him.  Tell No One, however, is Mr. Coben's best story yet. Halfway through this book, I was asking, &quot;Myron Who?&quot;<br />Imagine having your wife be your best friend since the age of seven and after a few months of marriage, she is dead.  Eight years later you are still mourning her death only to find that she might not really be dead.  Everywhere you turn to discover the truth, you are met with roadblocks and dishonesty.  Nothing is what is seems and no one is who you thought they were.  Friends aren't necessarily and help comes from the oddest places. The plot is so interwoven that you really need to read it with little or no knowledge just so you can enjoy the ride, and it is quite a ride - right up to the last page. The character development is outstanding.  This is a book where you really have feelings about all of the characters - maybe not all are favorable, but feelings, nonetheless.<br />Anyone who enjoys a fast-paced mystery filled with intrigue and surprise must read Tell No One.  If you haven't read any of Coben's other books, you might even want to spend the rest of the summer with them.  You won't be disappointed and you certainly won't be bored.  I will be waiting with great anticipation for his next book.	2001-06-25
US	53078327	R29N4N99ZQMUPX	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Enjoyable reading	The Brethren was a different type of book for Grisham.  This wasn't a story about the world of law, but more a story of politics gone awry.<br />(If you think politicians are corrupt now, this book certainly will  reinforce that belief).<br />This is a two pronged story line where the lives  of one cross the lives of the other.  It is about 3 judges in a camp - type  federal prison and a senator who has been picked to be the next president  by the head of the CIA.<br />While the former are scamming, the latter are  campaigning.  When the two story lines intersect, the book becomes quite a  page turner.  It is a story of greed and the power of money, and what might  happen when the two collide. Throw in the threat of war, a little  &quot;gayness,&quot; a little blackmail, and add a little Wag the Dog, and  you've got yourself a good story.<br />The ending is probably a good ending  from a writer's point of view, just not real satisfying for the  reader.<br />All in all, the book is entertaining, interesting, and one that  is difficult to put down. I wanted another chapter for a little more  closure,but maybe Mr. Grisham is thinking of a sequel.	2000-02-05

Reading this book was like going on a Sunday drive; passing nice scenery, and returning home.  There was no  excitement, no suspense, no amusement, just a pleasant excursion with  little to show at the end.<br />We gathered a glimpse into Qwill's past, but  even that was cut short with no hope of ever hearing the end.  The murdered  suspect was just a cardboard cutout with some innuendos, but nothing  substantial.  The same with the murderers.  There was absolutely no  character development at all.<br />Even the cats played a minor role.<br />This  book was like reading someone's journal of daily activities over a period  of a week or so.  Interesting, but certainly not worth the price of  admission.<br />Wait until this one comes out in paperback, or avoid it  altogether.	2000-01-23

I've followed every single one of their adventures and am proud to say that they are two marvelously fearless characters who I would follow anywhere.<br />Cussler, while perhaps not  sticking to the facts of earth's evolvement, has some grand description  that is worth reading and even educational.<br />It never ceases to amaze me  how Cussler manages to take an event that happened hundreds, or in this  case thousands, of years ago and weave it into a modern tale.<br />This book  is a wonderful read.  It is exciting and contains the usual Dirk and Al  wit.  This is a perfect action yarn to read on a cold winter's day by a  fire - or even on a sunny beach.<br />Dirk and Al, once again, become  embroiled in a conspiracy that might end life as we know it.  Once again,  Dirk and Al are victorious over evil.  To know them is to love them.<br />If  you like intrigue, adventure, and an almost blase attitude toward danger -  Cussler's Dirk and Al are for you.

This book was recommended to me by an Amazon.com customer, and am I glad I decided to read it.<br />I began this book on an airplane and found I could not even begin thinking about a vacation experience until I finished the  book.<br />I hate to oversimplify, but this book is a terrific tale of a bunch  of good guys, of the secret intelligence variety,  trying to stop the bad  guys from doing a very bad thing.  There are only a few problems; the good  guys haven't a clue what or where the bad guys are going to strike and, the  good guys aren't always perceived as the good guys.<br />This book is fast  paced, dramatic, and has enough suspense to keep anyone on the edge of  their seat.  It also gives the impression that this is pretty much the way  the real world works; at least the real world where I would like to reside.<br />If you enjoy spy/terrorist type books, this is a must read!	1999-12-21

It is the mark of a tremendous author that so many people feel that the Emersons are actually a part of their extended family.  I feel as if I have watched Ramses and Nefret grow up and that Amelia and Radcliff are members  of my family.  I still mourn the loss of the cat, Bastet, every time I read  another of the Emerson adventures.  This is one outstanding series.<br />Even  though this is a real page-turner, the lack of an ending leaves much to be  desired.  New readers of this series will recognize it as a very good read;  it is those of us who have allowed the Emersons into our hearts that are  upset by the current events.<br />This book was not as humorous as Peters'  past books, and Nefret's personality certainly wasn't the same as the  Nefret of past books.  I am disappointed in Nefret's actions - I thought  she was better than some stereotypical Victorian female.<br />I also was not  really thrilled with the warning Amelia received in her dream at the end of  the book.<br />Honestly, can't we just get Ramses and Nefret together and let  them carry on the fine Emerson tradition of murder and mayhem combined with  archeological digs and humor?  Ye Gads!<br />I am willing to bet that the next  book in this series (I certainly hope it will come out very soon) will be a  big-seller.  There are too many of us who want to know what happens  next.<br />My recommendation is to wait until the next book comes out, then  buy this one and read both of them then.  I certainly wish I had waited.	1999-06-29

The writing is excellent, the story lines absorbing,  and the best is the relationships among the characters.  Coben writes as if  the characters could jump out of the book and carry on a conversation with  you.	1999-06-29

I was beginning to think he was more intent on plugging his political views rather than writing a really good novel.  He is back on track with this one.<br />I will admit that other  reviewers' criticism that Grisham didn't spend enough time on the religious  conversion is probably very true.  Since, as we Grisham fans know, he is  very capable of going on ad nauseum on a favorite topic (homeless,  cigarette companies, etc.)  I hate to write that he needed to spend more  time with this - but that is the only criticism I can find.<br />This novel is  a very fast read.  I was hooked from page one and by the end of the 2nd  chapter, I knew I wasn't going to put it down until I finished it.<br />I  recommend this as a great, fun way to spend a Saturday, or any other day of  the week.	1999-02-07

I don't think that Ms. Braun  developed the plot sufficiently - or even at all.<br />It was as if there  were many different ideas in Ms. Braun's head, so she wrote about all of  them, but never to enough depth to get the reader interested.  It felt like  the entire book was the first two chapters.  I kept thinking that we would  go somewhere eventually, but then the story ended and we hadn't been  anywhere.<br />This shall not deter me from reading the next book as soon as  it is published.

Or, to use another &quot;old&quot; phrase, &quot;If it wasn't  one thing, it was another.&quot;  Where is Jack Ryan when you need  him?<br />I've always liked John Clark as a supporting character, and might  like him as a lead if Mr. Clancy hadn't put in so many disasters.<br />Mr.  Clark has found himself the head of a unique organization set up to fight  world terrrorists - but only when asked to help.  This man was busier than  the CIA during the Cold War.  It became too improbable, even for a diehard  Tom Clancy fan like myself.<br />The action was so non-stop, I began to ask  myself, &quot;Will this insanity never end?&quot;<br />I think there might  be a future for John Clark and his son-in-law as new crime fighting heroes;  they are both very likeable and talented.  Mr. Clancy just needs to calm  his exuberance and deal with one or two major world-peace shattering  terrorist events rather than 10 - one right after the other.<br />I was  exhausted after reading this one!	1998-10-11
US	53078327	R1COGNF9BE5PA0	0553298755	825668119	Black Ribbon	Books	3	3	4	N	N	One of her best	This was one of the best of the dog mystery series that Conant has  written.  Of course, the reader simply must love dogs more than anything in  order to enjoy these books because they are filled with lectures on  dog-training, raising, showing - just about anything to do with  dogs.<br />This book was better than others simply because it included more  information about other people and pets rather than dwelling on Malamutes  (which is a marvelous breed, don't get me wrong).<br />It also contained more  mystery than dog information, which doesn't happen often in Conant's books.  This little detail has never stopped me from reading everything she  writes.<br />She is great if you love dogs and just want a book to occupy your  time - but not take over your life until you finish.	1998-10-11

While it was very interesting to read the original history of the characters, I really wish I didn't know some of it.<br />The first part of the book was difficult to tell if Taylor wanted to write a mystery or a  sexy romance novel.  After Taylor finally made up her mind to write a mystery, the book did improve, somewhat.<br />While Taylor's latest books are excellent, amusing and have interesting plots, this one was slow and plodding during the first half.  The ending was typical Taylor and almost worth the wait...almost.<br />While I will probably continue reading Taylor's books because I really like Tory, I can't recommend this one. You are better off not knowing the history of some of the folks in this South Dakota town.	1998-07-08

Being an avid reader of mysteries, I am thrilled to find an author such as Coben to add to my list of must-reads.  Thanks to Amazon.com's recommendation, I first read Fade Away, then scampered to the computer to order the rest of Coben's books.  Even if you aren't a sports person, this book will be a joy to read and hard to put down.  His characters are interesting and just neurotic enough to be believeable.  The reader instantly likes both the hero, Myron, his best friend, the anti-hero, Win, as well as Myron's assistant and girl friend.  The plot is intricate and you wonder if it will all be tied together at the end.  This is one of the best mysteries I've read in a long time.  Try it - you won't be disappointed!	1998-02-16

Desiree Shapiro was new to me and I found I enjoyed her humor and writing style.  The plot was a little thin, but made up for in amusement.<br /><br />There are two kinds of books; those that you just want to curl up and read, and those that you can read while doing 4 other things.  Desiree Shapiro is an excellent book to occupy your mind while exercising.	1997-07-20

The children are growing up, (although Amelia has trouble admitting that fact) and have become an integral part of the family.<br /><br />Adding the journal, perhaps written by Ramses, gave the characters more depth and allowed the reader to see them in a different light.<br /><br /> With her uncanny knack for becoming embroiled in a season of mystery as well as archeological digging, Amelia has her hands full this season.  An old friend's husband is being hoodwinked by a con-artist with a consience, a southern Colonel is embroiled in the mystery disappearance of his last wife, his spoiled belle of a daughter is out to find a husband, Ramses being first on her list, and, in pure Amelia and Emerson style, there is the requisite numbers of nefarious people trying to make this the last adventure.<br /><br /> This is a must read for all lovers of suspense, villains, parody and humor.	1997-07-20
