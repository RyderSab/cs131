US	51043390	RT06BMU8A0P1X	193069945X	787121584	A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third Edition (PMBOK Guides)	Books	2	237	266	N	N	Poorly written book, however not many recognize its mediocrity	Note: This applies to the 3rd edition of the PMBOK Guide. The fourth edition appears to have cleaned up quite a few of these discrepancies.      This is a poorly written book. Diagrams that were updated or changed for this edition are badly done, to the point of being meaningless. Many processes have wildly different outputs for the same set of inputs. There are some process inputs that are inputs into most every process (e.g. \\"organizational process assets\\" a meaningless phrase if ever I heard one). Unfortunately the team in charge of this edition did not see it fit to have the book technically reviewed by the many experts in the field.     Beginning project managers will be ill served by trying to read this book and attempting to make sense of its contents. I would strongly recommend both classroom training and mentorship for those wanting to get into the field. Books alone won't cut it. This one certainly won't. I haven't come across one single experienced PM who used this book beyond passing the PMP exam.    For a more detailed critique of this book, search the web for Muhamed Abdomerovic's review. Unfortunately URLs cannot be pasted here. Some examples (mine):  1. Diagram 3-4: All those arrows pointing to nowhere in particular  2. Diagram 3-7: What's the difference between the gray boxes and the white boxes? Ditto for 3-8 and 3-9.  3. Figure III-2: Unclear what this diagram attempts to convey  4. Figure 4-2: What is the usefulness of showing a flowchart of integration tasks alone? Clearly on a project, a Project Manager with half a clue would not follow these tasks sequentially to the exclusion of the other knowledge areas!     I could find such inconsistencies almost all through the documents (e.g. some process names are verb phrases, others noun phrases). Finding other such gems is left as an exercise to the interested reader.     There is a widespread notion that Project Management = PMBOK. Nothing could be farther from the truth. You do not need the PMBOK to be an effective project manager. Conversely, knowing the PMBOK does not a Project Manager make (though the PMP certification would have you believe otherwise).	2005-10-01

Pick up a copy of this book, and be on your way to enjoying an operating system that is well built, and orders of magnitude more stable than Windows. In fact, I had zero installation issues with debian -- which compared favorably even with my attempts to install Fedora, another popular and well-regarded Linux distribution.     I liked this book because, finally, an author has had the presence of mind to write a book that did not regurgitate Unix commands like 'ls' and 'vi' for the gazillionth time. The focus is on debian, and  only on those parts that make debian unique -- the culture of the \\"debian project\\", the notoriety for its alleged difficulty of installation (which I have not experienced), the speed and timeliness of its releases (not!), and homage to that supreme program -- apt-get and its close relatives.     Those new to Linux may do well to first read a general Unix/Linux book before delving into this one. They will also be well served by first playing around with Knoppix (...) which is a debian derivative that does not require a hard-disk install. This is especially useful if you are not (yet) prepared to wipe your hard disk clean of Windows.    If you're not a rank beginner, buy this book, and install Debian 3.1 which is on the accompanying DVD. People wanting a more polished and up-to-date debian might want to try its close cousin, Ubuntu (...). While individual packages might vary somewhat, the concepts presented in this book are applicable across debian and its progeny (including Knoppix and Ubuntu).     In summary, raise the quality of your Linux reading a few notches by purchasing this book, and raise the quality of your personal computer usage by installing debian or its derivatives.	2005-09-29

Nothing wrong in that, but if you are looking for a robust, updated Negotiation framework, then this book will not provide it for you.  <br /> <br />\\"Getting to Yes\\" still remains the very best Negotiation primer you can read. After that, read the other books to fill in the details into the conceptual framework established by \\"Getting to Yes\\".	2005-09-25

On the \\"good\\" part, a Debian book that gives a high level overview of everything is welcome, because the documentation sometimes loses the forest for the trees. A Debian book is also a good investment because of the system's stability. if Woody is any indication, this book should be current for the next quarter of a decade.  <br /> <br />On the \\"could have been better\\" side, this book suffers from a certain lack of focus -- is it aimed towards the rank beginner in Linux (in some chapters, it is assumed that the reader is a rank beginner). Or is it aimed towards an intermediate reader? (witness the more complex discussions of APT). While the discussions of apt were involved, they were not IMHO as good as the freely available APT-HOWTO. Any discussion of APT should have been _preceded_ by a discussion of the structure of a Debian repository. <br /> <br />The main author himself admits that he came into the book at a late stage to pick up the pieces and put it together. He has explicitly admitted what is implicitly recognizable -- the book has been put together by multiple people at different points in time.  <br /> <br />Finally there are two CDs in the back of the book -- one a minimal Sarge install, and the other a Knoppix CD. The reader would have been better served by one DVD of a full Sarge install. After all, Knoppix is not really based on Sarge, which is the topic of this book.  <br /> <br />A better strategy for Linux authors will be to separate their Linux writing into two separate kinds of books -- one kind of book discusses only distribution-specific detail (such as apt and friends). Another kind of book discusses only general Linux programs that are common across distributions (e.g. using ls, vi, etc).  <br /> <br />	2005-08-25

Project Management is a field that requires three things in equal proportion: training, mentoring, and job experience.  <br /> <br />What this book _will_ do for you is that it will give you an excellent overview of project management. You can use this book to read through and get an idea for the field. Then, if you are interested in pursuing further training, you ought to sign up for a series of training courses such as those offered by ESI International. Simultaneously, you would seek out a mentor, and opportunities for on-the-job experience.  <br /> <br />I wish the author had aligned his terminology better with the PMBOK Guide 3rd edition. While the content is top-notch, the terminology used does not necessarily match the PMBOK Guide. This means that people cannot _easily_ use it as preparation material for the PMP certification exam.  <br /> <br />With these caveats out of the way, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this as an introductory book, especially to aspiring Project Managers. The price point of this book is marvelous -- there is more relevant content here than tomes that cost 5-6 times as much.	2005-04-27

What I liked about it was that it is a widely accepted translation, excellent commentary on most every verse (important to someone like me that did not grow up reading The Bible), and a lot of contextual information (drawings, book introductions, etc).<br /><br />For the uninitiated, it is a toss-up between this and the Quest Study Bible, also published by Zondervan. The Quest has a slight edge for the lay person as opposed to the serious Bible student -- it has answers to a number of blunt questions that may cross your mind, but which do not classify as Bible Study.<br /><br />I purchased a leather bound edition of this Bible from an Amazon seller. It was brand new, in unopened packaging, in leather, for far less than the list price of the paperback version. So, shop around the Amazon marketplace sellers before you buy.<br /><br />The only quibble I have is that Zondervan does not stitch the spine of its Bibles (atleast not the one that I have). No matter how carefully you treat it, a stitched spine always beats a gummed spine. See if you can get an edition with a stitched spine for a few extra dollars. It will be worth it.	2005-04-20

The physical book is rated two stars.<br /><br />When you pay $100 list for a collector's edition book, you expect it to be perfect in all respects. I am on my 3rd copy of this edition and am still dissatisfied.<br /><br />The first book had paper that was poorly folded. There were many pages that were misfolded. I returned that and got another copy. This one had a whole signature [one group of pages] with a tear at the top edge.<br /><br />I returned that and got a third copy. This one seems OK, but the pages are not centered in the hard cover. Its rather dissatisfying, but I think I will keep it.<br /><br />The publisher should take their printer/binder to task. Three strikes in three pitches is unacceptable for what is a very expensive edition to begin with.<br /><br />BTW all three copies had glue that overflowed onto the inside cover pages. When you try to separate the pages, they tear where the glue had been.<br /><br />I think that the publisher dishonors Tolkien's marvelous work and insults their readers by publishing an expensive edition with such poor quality control.	2004-12-05

The author discusses three different kinds of project management: Traditional, Adaptive and Extreme. The book is worth the purchase price for just the discussion on the Traditional project management method. The material about &quot;Adaptive&quot; and &quot;Extreme&quot; variations are icing on the cake.<br />What I like about this book is that the author effectively acknowledges the shortcomings of traditional project management and does not harp on its dogma. The material on adaptive project management offers a way out for those projects where the method of implementation is so unknown that traditional full-court project management practices will only hurt and not help. Much of the information on adaptive and extreme project management is similar to the &quot;extreme programming&quot; methodology, but specifically targeted towards a project manager.<br />I think this book is an excellent purchase. It is well written and succinct (unlike the 1000 pages of bullet-points from a competing author). Other reasons to purchase the book are its reasonable price and the fact that you get a trial version of Microsoft Project 2002 with it. <br />I wish the author had gone into greater depth about earned value. I have found earned value difficult to do without good support from the project management tool (calculating BCWS for example is tedious to do by hand); every time I tried to do earned value for a real project using MP98 or MP2000 the tool has crashed on me. <br />In summary I believe that this is an excellent book, and should be read by every project manager.	2003-08-27

The third edition touches upon non-traditional project management. In other words, project management in real life as opposed to what is in most every textbook.<br />To me the value of the third edition lies in Robert Wysocki's recognition of projects where either the goal is clear but the methods aren't, or where even the goal is unclear. These types of projects seem to predominate in IT. This book is worth purchasing for the insight that the authors bring into the non-traditional non-textbook real-life projects.<br />The prose is clearly written and reads very tightly. Contrast this to the random collection of thoughts in Kerzner's book. This book is written for the practitioner, though someone taking a college course in project management would also benefit.<br />Excellent book, at an excellent price. You can't go wrong.	2003-08-15

The text is clear, well organized and well written. The typography makes liberal use of color, which makes reading _much_ easier when compared to a monochrome textbook. There are copious examples, illustrations and exercises. The book comes with a workbook (purchased separately) which contains template pages to write in your answers (trust me, you will need it). All chapters are grounded in current reality -- the authors make a point of tying the concepts to real-life situations.<br />On the cons, the 2002 edition deals with 2000 data -- their production process needs to be speeded up.<br />I think that a thorough review of this text will give the reader an excellent start in basic accounting.	2003-06-09

The information is quite current (most statistics are updated to somewhere between 2000 - 2002).

I do not have to read this cover to cover. I can read a page or even a half page in a few minutes to get useful data.<br />There's really not much I would change about this Almanac.

Ralph does not just lecture to you -- he shows you how to put it into practice<br />* Coverage of a vast variety of domains. This alone makes the book a must-read<br />* Recap of major principles at the end of the book to bring it all together<br />* Excellent writing -- Ralph does not treat you like a dummy; neither does he assume that you have an IQ north of 200<br />* When you purchase this book, you are in effect purchasing a sliver of the combined knowledge of both authors in the data warehousing field. Highly recommended<br />I implemented a data warehouse using some of these principles back in 1999. The project was a resounding success and is the most popular application in the financial services firm that I implemented it in. (Infact when I lost my job at an Internet company, they immediately offered me a job based on this implementation). The only sad part to the whole story is that we made a few mistakes in implementation that are now very difficult to correct because the data warehouse has become core to the business -- we have too many end-user applications riding on it!	2002-08-27

For example there is no comparison of it with Perl. In fact they never say how the two can work.<br />Also the authors do not cover at all the Meta Object Protocol of Python or for example how it does virtual pointer-based interface inheritance. These are important concepts that a student of Python must know. Also missing is any information on the transmutation of objects under constraints.<br />All in all, way too elementary.	2002-07-26

They are:<BR>* Right types of fats<BR>* Aerobic _and_ strength training exercise each morning<BR>* Restricted eating with tracking in a simple way<br />The problem I have is that some of his claims are vastly exaggerated. For example:<br />* His claim of helping 3 million people through his web site: he has a basic HTML website with no functionality behind it. Heck, he does not even host his own forums but piggybacks off Yahoo and MSN. Don't you think that if he really had that many clients he would have an Amazon.com kind of quality web site? I suspect that he is claiming his number from the web server logs on his site. In which case, he has helped various search \\"bots\\" like Google and Altavista lose weight as well!<br />* This whole business with flax seed oil seems a little fishy. Some parts of his book read like a brochure for products he is selling. And the claims are quite hyped up -- makes you stop and think<br />* It is unclear what Jorge was doing before the publication of his book. Tell us what you've done in the past that supports your claims Jorge!<br />With the above caveats for hype (which probably got inserted either by his editor, agent, or ghostwriter) it is a decent book.

While I criticize Covey for milking the 7 Habits paradigm for all its worth with mediocre follow on books after his first magnum opus, atleast he has a lot of material in that book.What I would have loved to see from Hyrum Smith is his original book reworked for the Palm world. Unfortunately that is not to be.	2000-10-22

However I tremendously enjoyed this book. Yesterday I even beat my computer (albeit at a low setting) by using some of the techniques described here.For a good understanding of chess basics, tactics and strategy you cannot go wrong with this book.I also like the author's style. No manufactured humor, no condescencion. He genuinely wants to teach you a game he obviously loves.Give this to a chess novice or to yourself if you are one. This is a good investment and an inexpensive one at that.	2000-10-15

Where he excels is in placing PM in the Organizational context. A read of this book can tell you how PM will fit into an organization, and the types of conflict that can arise when line management and project management come together.<br />Some aspects of the book (e.g. planning and project leadership/influence skills) are comprehensive enough to be books themselves. If you did not buy this one book, you might haveto buy many different books at higher cost to achieve the same coverage of topics. I have also found the author's coverage of issues to be thoughtful, comprehensive and meaningful. It is not fluffy.<br />Do not expect to start using this book the day you get nominated as a Project Manager. This is more in the nature of a study book, and less like a workbook, or a what-do-I-need-to-do-starting-tomorrow-morning guide. However your diligence in studying its contents will, I believe, be richly rewarded.<br />What do I not like about this book? * The author's endless fascination with bullet points. In some places the book reads like it was a transcript of his lectures. * Style of delivery is very dry. There is no change of tempo. * Poor figures. I could not understand many of the statistical figures at first glance. * Bad taste in cartoons. 'Nuff said. * The binding -- it is gummed at the spine for a very heavy book. Handle it roughly and it will come apart.	2000-09-28

While Java gets all the press, it is Perl which is quietly working in many back-offices, doing all sorts of menial tasks which take  too long in other languages.<br />I depend upon Perl to write small one-off  programs that access and transform data. I also used it to migrate data for  1,800 employees from unstructured Excel spreadsheets to a relational  database. It took me far less time and was essentially free when compared  to other data migration approaches.<br />This book is the definitive work on  Perl. The authors' love of Perl comes through. What also comes through is  that the authors genuinely love their audience. While you will find that  they are endowed with laziness, impatience and hubris, you will soon  discover that there can be an immensely positive slant to these  &quot;vices&quot;. Their sense of humor lends fun to what could become a  dry subject in others' hands.<br />Learn Perl from the people that invented  the language, that work and train others in the language everyday. Buy this  book.	2000-08-01

There is no central theme. Every now and then there are invocations of the Seven Habits.<br />The number of product and service  pitches Covey makes is absolutely amazing. His very overt salesmanship puts  off the reader.<br />The original Seven Habits book was a masterpiece. Since  then, Covey has been stuck in a hackneyed paradigm that he repeats time and  time again. Each succeeding book after 7H sells less and less.<br />Time to  let go, Mr. Covey. Focus on things other than the Seven Habits. The Seven  Habits is a marvelous work. Do not compromise it with mediocre follow-ons.	2000-04-02

It is more in the nature of evidence that the principles taught in Seven Habits of Highly Effective People work.<br />Putting the Seven Habits to work requires commitment and patience.  In my personal life, I have always had to work very hard to choose my  response, instead of just snapping at the other person if they did not  agree with me.<br />I find many of these stories interesting. However I also  find that this book is not essential to following the Seven Habits. The  best use of this book is if you are skeptical about the Seven Habits, then  you can read it so that you get proof it works. Then you can go to the main  book.<br />This said, I believe that Stephen Covey must get off the Seven  Habits bandwagon. His first work was a masterpiece that I continue to read  and re-read. Subsequent derivative works have not achieved the greatness of  the first, and he is in real risk of diluting the Seven Habits franchise if  he goes on and on. The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People is a  completed work. The brilliant thinking and concepts that produced it do not  need a book every year to keep them going.<br />I also believe that the  observance of the Seven Habits are a necessary condition for true success  but not a sufficient condition. It would be enlightening to see Dr. Covey  explore other essential areas of improvement in self, family and business  without necessarily being locked in to the Seven Habits. I want to know if  there are habits eight, nine and ten. I suspect there are, though I don't  know what they are.<br />It's time for a paradigm shift, Dr. Covey.	2000-03-22

These are not Dr. Covey's habits. These are natural principles which he has put into easily digestible chunks.<br />Given Franklin Covey's  tribulations, and the poorly done merger of Franklin Quest with Covey  Leadership Center, one would wish that Dr. Covey had practised more of  these habits himself. (He was co-chairman of the merged company until a  recent self-demotion)<br />I also hope that in the 7H material, Dr. Covey  would obsess less with trademarking every other word. When you get the  booklet they promise you, you will see that they have trademarked every  other word. Where is your abundance mentality, Dr. Covey?<br />Seriously  speaking, the book is a worthy work.	2000-02-16

It requires a basic camera with a built in light meter and a knowledge of how to use it.<br />This  book explains in an excellent manner when you should trust your light  meter, and when you should modify its recommendations. It explains very  well the relationship between aperture, shutter speed and depth of  field.<br />Ever since I bought this book I have sworn off flash, and blindly  using automatic metering, almost entirely. I use a very basic camera -- a  manual focus Olympus OM 2000 (a $200 SLR). I have been able to make some  excellent pictures with what I have learned here.<br />Do yourself a favor  before you buy yourself a fancy $1000 camera with a whiz-bang matrix 3-d  meter.

It is a textbook.<br />To talk about other reviewers' comments, this is not an OO book. This is not a book about programming methodology. It is simply a book  that explains how Java is used to write programs. The programs themselves  are not the subject as much as how they are written using Java.<br />I think  that some of the criticisms leveled in this page are quite unfair. I am a  technical team leader with 5 years experience in IT programming. I have  both bachelor's and master's degrees in CS. I have worked in C++ and C for  a long time. Yet I liked this book because of its examples and code. I also  enjoyed the exercises.<br />I wish the book were smaller and less expensive.  The CD-ROM is really unnecessary if the authors had provided the software  on their web site. Also if all the Java links in the book's appendices were  on the authors' web site, it would have saved some more trees. I sometimes  wish the Deitels had written with greater brevity. There  are also some  really silly errors like lists that start with (h) instead of (a) in the  self-review exercises (looks like Microsoft Word did them in. Also looks  like their editor did a rush job).<br />Don't mistake me -- this is a good  book to learn Java from. If you are looking to learn OO or looking to learn  algorithms or even how programs ought to be written, look elsewhere.	1999-09-09

It is also a good book for professionals that want to teach themselves Java.<br />I do not dispute some of the inaccuracies that  other readers mention. When the software changes so rapidly that authors  have a tough time keeping up, you have to put up with some errors. However  here is why I bought the book:<br />(1) Reasonably clear explanation of  language features.<br />(2) The Deitels are trainers. When I buy their book I  buy their training experience as well. They know what kinds of mistakes  novices make and incorporate that knowledge into their material.<br />(3) I  like a book sprinkled with a lot of annotated examples.<br />(4) I like a book  with a lot of exercises and a summary at the back of each chapter. Many  times I find myself forgetting a chapter as soon as I end it. The summary  helps reinforce my learning. As far as exercises are concerned, if you  don't practice immediately on learning something, it will not stay with  you.<br />That said, the Deitels need to be much less verbose (they could have  done this book in half the pages and not lost anything). They also need a  good editor -- there are places in the book where they repeat themselves  way too much.	1999-09-03

It is an entry-level SLR camera. up until I read Tom and Michele's wonderful book, I never took good photographs. <br />When I read their book, I finally understood f-stops and metering. I now understand why the first 50 rolls I shot all had  underexposed skin tone. The first role I shot after I read the book cover  to cover gave me more &quot;keepers&quot; than any roll before it.<br />There  is no better book for the SLR novice to understand the functioning of his  camera than this one. And do not get taken in when the rocket scientists of  Photography belittle your particular brand of camera -- apply the Grimms'  advice and you will find dramatic improvement in the performance of your  camera (well it is actually the photographer that has improved :-))<br />The  book has a very good chapter on composition. However I wish it had more  chapters on the &quot;Art&quot; of photography. Things like how to find  interesting subjects, how to shoot subjects, etc. <br />This book is excellent  for understanding how an SLR works, with some good advice on composition  thrown in.<br />Readers will find this book to be very compatible with  &quot;Photography for Dummies&quot;, which deals more with how to take  photographs.	1999-06-25

From  what I have read and used so far, this is a good book. No one can learn  Perl from it, but once you __use__ Perl on a regular basis, you will find  it indispensable.<br />So dear friends, look elsewhere for examples or  tutorials.

The author truly drives home the point that getting a good photograph is  not just about twiddling buttons or dials.<br />If you thought you knew all  about point and shoot photography, boy will you be in for a surprise.<br />I  also liked the tone of the author's writing. He is never condescending and  uses tremendous amounts of example photographs to illustrate what he is  talking about.<br />Highly recommended for anyone that owns a camera,  regardless of whether it costs $10 or $1000.	1998-09-05

Some of the material overlaps with the Camel book, particularly the first few chapters. The chapters dealing with complex data structures and references are well covered in the Camel and the repetition here is, for the most part, needless. Also some of the examples appear boring and contrived.    Other than the first 6 chapters, I have read the code generation chapter. This is what has me all excited. I have written my own code generator but the elegance of this one is remarkable.    In conclusion, after reading through more than a third of the book, I can say that while it is not the best Perl book in existence (that honor properly belongs to the Camel), this book is worth a place on the shelf of a serious Perl programmer.	1997-09-05

Most of the pages do not speak of Office-room  stupidity which is Scott Adams's forte but   is a rambling and incoherent account about   nothing in particular.    The book does not do much of what Scott Adams  is great at -- poke fun at Corporate America.  Instead it is a high-priced, fairly thin book  that recycles some old laughs and tacks on a lot  of boring drivel.    I somehow get the suspicion that it is more   an attempt to cash in on the Dilbert name and  fame than an attempt to write a halfway decent  book.	1997-05-18
