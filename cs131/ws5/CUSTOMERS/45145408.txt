He begins by describing Abraham's calling as a universal religious symbol that ties together the world's three major monotheistic religions, progresses through the many versions of Abraham's story which evolve into a struggle to \\"own\\" Abraham, and concludes by drawing the diverging stories back to a common theme of inclusiveness.<br /><br />Though parts of the book may be too flippant for deeply religious readers, overall, Feiler successfully attempts to balance reverence for sacred texts and critique of their apparent evolution. Likewise, he delicately navigates a minefield of political issues related to the story of Abraham and its impact on the Middle East. He achieves this by quoting individual interviews of an eclectic group ranging from religious leaders and Harvard professors to shopkeepers and taxi drivers, essentially creating dialogue between people who would otherwise never engage in conversation together.<br /><br />I don't take issue with the lack of scholarship or the dearth of references in the book as that is exactly what makes the book so accessible and universal. If anything, the approach appropriately reflects the theme the book. This is such an easy read that it would be a wonderful choice for any book club.	2005-10-02

It is complete, concise, compact, easy to flip through quickly, and affordable. I love the side by side lists so that I can compare similar diseases. The lists of genetic syndromes by inheritance pattern is also extremely helpful. It must be paired with an atlas since it has no pictures. But it does have a few important diagrams (like TE fistulas) and several EKG tracings. Because of its small size and bullet format, I would often tuck it into my purse and glance at it on the subway or at other random times.    One major negative is that it does not highlight or use bold print to indicate the single most important symptom or distinguishing factor of any disease (i.e. the \\"buzzwords\\")-- yet this is exactly what the exam tests (your ability to pick out the one distinguishing feature in a long list of nonspecific symptoms). And I found a couple errors and omissions.     Pros:  *comprehensive  *quick/easy review  *portable  *affordable  *mostly bullet format but some text  *excellent tables on associations between maternal meds/dz and congenital abnl/heart defects  *many side by side tables  *gives specific treatments in ID section  *AAP guidelines well explained  *EKGs given  *contains some diagrams, graphs  *occasional mnemonics    Cons:  *buzzwords or distinguishing s/s not highlighted (my biggest complaint -- I'd take off half a star for this)  *a few important omissions: i.e. posterior urethral valves, Rx of hypernatremia  *a couple of mistakes  *genetic chapter: overall good but the couple more commonly tested syndromes need more depth (i.e. NF-1 -- diagnostic criteria and assoc. cancers not given)  *metabolic: also overall good, would like to see more focus on age of presentation (i.e. include that in charts, currently only given inconsistenly in text)  *no pictures or radiographs	2005-09-20

You have to know every single word in the book since it is very high yield. But it is perfect for a quick, efficient review of important topics. My only goal was to pass but I actually did pretty well on the exam.  The book needs more on ethics and social issues. But, I used the old edition (neon green and black cover) and maybe the new edition covers that -- not sure though (which is why, if I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars). I paired it with Kaplan's Qbook and felt very well prepared for the exam.	2004-10-30

I passed with flying colors. The questions were almost identical to the ones on the exam in terms of content, format, style, and length. Some questions on the exam seemed to be straight out of this book. They do a really good job of explaining the answers in the back. I would recommend this book to anyone who has more than a few days to study for Step 3. I also used Crush Step 3 to prepare.

US	45145408	R2G05RGAHXI1O	0658003712	834135128	AAA Essential Guide: Andalucia	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very aptly named	I am a big believer in traveling light and I hate to carry around a huge travel book, so this book perfectly suited my purposes. I read up on the history before hand and I just wanted a small book that would fit easily into my purse (and not weigh me down) that would remind me of all the essential places and facts. It does an excellent job at hilighting all the most important aspects of Andalucia. This book suited my purposes very well. <br />It is surprisingly thorough for its size. I thought it was very well organized and easy to read. There is clever use of symbols and color coding that helps to conserve space yet are easy to understand. It covers all the essential facts about each major city: what to see, where to eat, what to do, local customs and festivals, how to get around, a little background, etc. It mentions minor cities/areas of interest with their claims to fame. The last few pages offer some practical travel and safety information and some common Spanish words. Scattered throughout the pages are various random factoids of interest.<br />I would not advise this as the only book to read before traveling. One definitely needs to supplement with other information and is not adequate for planning the trip. For instance, for each major city, there are only five or six hotels mentioned. It is not helpful in figuring out where to stay or where to eat or shop in the smaller towns and it is not helpful in finding hostels. The maps of the major cities are very small and are of limited help in navigating the streets (more helpful in getting on overview and general orientation). But then I've always been the type to befriend locals and get the information first-hand about what to see, where to go, how to get around, where to eat and shop, etc. I tend to wander randomly instead of strictly following a map. I focus on fully experiencing a place instead of having my nose buried in a book. This definitely is not the book if you want to understand the significance and history of every statue and carving you see.<br />I'd say that the biggest advantage of the book is its size. For a few more dollars though, you can probably get a book with a lot more information. Whether you will like this book really depends on your style of traveling and what you want from a travel book.	2003-01-25
US	45145408	R92N0GZ0TY20V	0380002930	498635851	Watership Down	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Marvelous book for all ages	I picked up this book from the \\"give away\\" pile at home to read on a horrendously long plane ride and I found it so engrossing that I couldn't put it down. It is incredible how the story makes the characters human enough to create sympathy and interest in the reader and yet they remain true to their species, so they do not seem \\"humanized\\". The characters are dynamic, learning from each other and from their circumstances, gaining maturity and wisdom. There is a good balance between developing the plot and description (necessary for the reader to understand the dynamics of rabbit communities and to appreciate how rabbits view the world). I found the rabbit mythology, their own form of religion which reminded me of the greek myths, fascinating. These \\"myths\\" were very naturally woven into the plot, stories that rabbits told each other to amuse, inspire, distract.<br />I suppose the most unbelievable part of the book, is the fact that despite facing the most dire circumstances, none of the main characters die (only peripheral ones do). I was also disappointed that there were few, if any, memorable female characters (though the lack of females in the community drives the plot in the latter part of the book, so I suppose females are not entirely marginalized, but they are objectified).<br />One might think a book about rabbits as just \\"fluff\\" (no pun intended), but this story explores so many important themes: vision, loyalty, courage, faith, being true to oneself, acceptence of others/cooperation, etc. I think the animal element would appeal to children, yet the content of the book would be equally interesting for an adult.	2002-03-29

His journey through various spiritual stages is inspiring - especially the difficulties he faced as a convert to Islam. He tackles many of the challenges/obstacles/controversies that face Islam in America: how to separate Islam from culture, tradition, and politics. He is not afraid to expose what he believes to be the shortcomings of the Muslim ummah. But he turns the same sharply critical eye on his past and admits to his own mistakes. His criticism though, is meant to show where American Muslims need to progress and grow. Though I do not agree entirely with Dr. Lang's practice of Islam (since he places a great deal of emphasis on the Quran but is less heedful of Hadith/Sunnah), he inarguably has some very important things to say. His book will appeal to young American Muslims because Dr. Lang explains the basis of his faith in a very logical, realistic, and *American* way. And certainly this book is a very important resource for new Muslims who may be feeling lost in a new world. Dr. Lang uses very clear, simple language to express himself so the book is very easy reading. <br />I am not sure this book would be comprehensible to a non-Muslim who is unfamiliar with the internal dynamics of Muslim communities (not knowing the differences between sects, nationalities, cultures, age groups, political inclinations, etc). If one has a new or casual interest in Islam, this book is too focused to be a good starting point. It might be interesting reading for someone with a core knowledge/understanding of Islam and the Muslim world.	2002-03-14

Those who are interested in a discussion of politicized Islam or the practice of Islam in various contries will be disappointed. Yet, I feel this book is successful and timeless precisely because it avoids the volatile details that represent modern Muslims in the media. Eaton reflects on Islam throughout the ages (as Muslims believe time to be irrelevant to Islam. It is an immutable message, the same for all generations of people).<br />While Eaton does explore the clash of Islam and Western culture, he focuses on ideological differences. He argues that the very notion of progress as defined by the West, is at odds with the spirit of Islam. He contrasts the human-centered world of the West versus the God-centered world of Islam. For example, in the chapter, \\"The Earth's Complaint\\", Eaton explains that humans must be caretakers of God's creatures and God's earth. We should not arrogantly plunder our environment to suit our own goals, but should see it is a precious gift from the Creator. Eaton critisizes the Muslim \\"ummah\\" (community) for losing touch with the essense of Islam, and instead, blindly emulating the \\"advances\\" of the West (in terms of technology, science, government, etc) without contemplating the consequences or significance. Eaton peppers his book with well chosen quotes from an impressive array of sources (ranging from Shakespeare and modern scientists to Sufi masters and the Quran itself). The reader, even if (s)he does not agree with Eaton's conclusions, is impressed by the well-supported arguments. Towards the end of the book, Eaton's sufi tendencies do surface. His discussion of the sufi approach is an intriguing contrast to the dogmatic tone of many modern Muslim scholars.<br />I found the book very spiritually enlightening. I feel that it is an important book for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. However, at times I found Eaton's style to be a little dry or convoluted. There were certain chapters I had to read twice. Partly, as a doctor, I found some of his statements regarding modern science too shocking to absorb intially. (Eaton does discuss the negative response he gets from most Muslims regarding his views on modern science and technology) But, on re-reading, I was able to overcome my gut reaction and appreciate his ideas. I feel that it is worth the extra effort. This book certainly is food for thought.	2002-03-14

Dawood often distorts the message. He turns observations about wartime activity into commands of aggression. He transforms passages regarding the natural love between husband and wife into suggestions that women are soley for a man's pleasure.<br /><br />Those who want to appreciate the poetry are best off reading the orginal Arabic (or buying a taped version so they can listen to it without having to learn Arabic) Those who are interested in a translation that preserves the beauty of the language and an accompanying in depth explanation should read \\"The Message of the Quran\\" by Muhammad Asad. By virtue of being a translation, it too has its faults, but it considered the best thing short of learning Arabic.	2001-10-10

It is the one that is supported by the government of Saudi Arabia and is most widely read by English-speaking Muslims. A translation of the Qur'an can never fully transmit the meaning or reflect the beauty of the original text. But the reality is that many people who seek to understand the message of the Qur'an will not be able to learn Arabic. It should be kept in mind that though the Arabic word may have multiple meanings, only one of those meanings gets translated to English (imagine what would happen to one of Shakespeare's puns if it was traslated to Arabic). But for English-speakers, this is the best option (though Mohammad Asad's translation is also very respected). The caveat is that to truly understand the Qur'an, it is important to read not only the text itself, but to understand it in context of the time it was revealed. Though Muslims consider the Qur'an to be timeless, many passages relate specifically to events occuring in the prophet's life or in the young Muslim community.	2001-10-09

This book highlighted several key points that actually came on my exam. However the format of the questions did not accurately represent the exam (but I have not found *any* set of questions that does). Good points: 1/3 of the questions have lots of lab values that you must sift through. In the actual exam you must be very comfortable with lab values. There are excellent quality images in the book. And the explantions are concise yet informative. Bad points: 2/3 of the questions are either &quot;all are true EXCEPT&quot; (which do not appear on the exam) or are quick recall (when the actual exam is more conceptual). All in all, I am glad I used this book and would recommend it as a study tool.	2001-07-01

It also gives a quick review of the relevant basics (pathophysiology, anatomy, etc.).

High yield subjects consistently tested from a clinical slant like Pathopysiology and Microbiology are the best books of this series.  Pharmacology and Anataomy are the least useful books of this series.  However, it may still be worth it to buy the set since buying only the &quot;useful&quot; books adds up to almost as much.  I recommend skimming through the table of contents in advance and deciding which diseases need to be reviewed, then randomly going to the appropriate pages to test oneself.  Otherwise one could waste time on very simple/obvious diseases (reading the vignettes is more time consuming than reading a review book).  I found it very helpful for the rare, obscure, or confusing diseases (especially in Biochemistry).  This series is especially useful for the pre-clinical student but has limited use for the IMG who is already well versed in clinical presentations.  I liked the way the &quot;buzzwords&quot; of each vignette were highlighted.  While it meant that it was not representative of the exam (where one must differentiate between extraneous and pertinent information), it did help me recognize the most characteristic signs and symptoms of a particular disease entity.  Each page is broken down to CC, HPI, PE, Labs, Imaging, Gross and Micro Path, Treatment, and Discussion.  Overall, a good investment.	2001-03-29

After the exam, I realized just how good the book was.  The book looks thick but that is only because the charts and diagrams are big and clear and there is plenty of room to add notes.  It is an excellent final review of key concepts and details.  Much easier to read than First Aid.  If you know everything in this book, you are very well prepared for Step 1.	2001-03-25
