In this novel the authors open up the whole series, introduce the world, and some characters very precisely. I enjoyed this book immensely and I'm sure that the next books in this promising series will be just as good as volume one.<br /> Many things take place in \\"Dragon Wing.\\" The book starts off with an assassin being rescued from being executioned and he is then presented with a task assigned by the King. He is being asked to murder the King's son, the Prince himself! Meanwhile, a Geg (Dwarf) is going against the major religon of his people and will begin to change the way the world looks at everything. From the first grabbing pages to the very last, where some of the plot is wrapped up, though the reader will be in suspense for the next novel, this extraordinary novel entertains. <br /> One of the most inventive and \\"cool\\" things about this book is the world that the story takes place in. The world is broken up into four realms, fire, stone, water, and sky. This book only takes place in the sky part of the world, but I'm sure that the future novels of this series will get into the other realms. The sky world is comprised of three different levels, the low realm, the mid realm, and the high realm. Within these realms are many islands that float in the air. People build, live, and work on these \\"islands in the sky\\" as if they were on a regular world. The three races in the book are the Gegs, Humans, and Elves. It is interesting to see how they travel in the world (using big magical ships) and how they react with one another.<br /> The main characters in this novel are very enjoyable to read about and are likeable. You actually care what will happen to these people by the end of the book, so you keep reading. However, these characters were not entirely original. One of the characters was your typical prince; his servant was heroic, so that was a bit orignal; the assassin is an adventurer type; and Limbeck was probably the most original of the characters. There are many other characters that come in between as well. An interesting thing that Weis and Hickman do is their portrayal of elves. The elves in this book are not your typical elves as they are not kind and thoughtful. These elves have an attitude and are mostly mean. <br /> With an inventive plot, fun characters, and an interesting world \\"Dragon Wing\\" doesn't disappoint. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series. For a fantasy fan that is looking for a bit of originality in their reading this novel cannot be beat.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-10-01
US	48100764	R2V4AQAFAE6OM8	0061051098	189798256	The Iron Lance (The Celtic Crusades #1)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Enthralling Historical Fiction	&quot;The Iron Lance&quot; was my first Stephen R. Lawhead novel and it was a novel that I enjoyed all the way through. While Lawhead is mostly labled as a fantasy writer his work is not limited to fantasy, as this book shows. I love fantasy and I found this book to be a break from the general magic that is involved in much of today's fantasy. Lawhead's book is an intoxicating historical fiction. <br /> The book takes place during the Crusades, a very interesting time during the history of the world. This period is when the Pope sent forces into Jerusalem to win the Holy City from the Muslims. This book centers on Murdo, the main protagonist, and how he is involved with the events of his time. After his father and brothers go to fight for the Holy Land he stays behind in his hometown with his mother. When his beautiful home is taken away from him he decides to go find his brothers and father. Along the way he meets up with a group of clerics and meets many friends and foes. The book is full of many battles, politics, and entertaining scenes.<br /> Murdo is a very likeable character that many readers will enjoy reading about. You can't help but wonder what his outcome will be at the end of the book. You'll be asking yourself whether or not he'll see his loved ones again and if he'll survive through the harsh times that he is living in. His girlfriend, Ragna, is a great feminine character that can be felt for as you can see that she is going through hard times, being away from her loved Murdo and her brothers and father, as well. The clerics that Murdo meets up with are quite interesting as well, especially their background. Other side characters are well written as well, such as King Bohemond, but most of the others were a trifle boring. <br /> One of the most enjoyable things about this novel is the historical backgound that Lawhead provides. Mr. Lawhead provides a riveting read while feeding you huge chunks of historical background and the amount of fact that is presented never seems daunting. Fans of history will undoubtedly enjoy this historical fiction masterpiece. &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; entertains from the great first pages to the wonderful last ones. This is a great read that's definitely recommended. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-26
US	48100764	R2PNCNI2BB2CEB	0671041789	867268465	The Green Mile	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Stunning	King here delivers a masterpiece. \\"The Green Mile\\" is a work of genius that not many authors could have pulled off as well as Stephen King. This amazing novel was originally published as a serial novel in six parts a few years back. The book flows wonderfully even though with the start of a new part King may review the last scene of the last book that was read. I would think that reading each part of the book together as the one whole novel that it is would make the book more enjoyable, so for people who have read this book when it was first being published in parts, you may want to re-read this book to get a better feel for what King is writing.<br /> The novel takes place on the E Block of Cold Mountain Penitentiary (a death row, or \\"Green Mile\\") and takes place over a fairly short amount of time. The book tells the story of the times when convicted murderer John Coffey is going to be put to death. The book is told in the first person through the eyes of Paul Edgecombe, the leader of the E Block. This novel also involves many other people, such as the other men that run the E Block and other murderers that are on death row. <br /> There is a hint of the paranormal in this novel, but for horror [fans], there are no scares here. And quite frankly, I have never been scared by a Stephen King novel. I find his books to lean more in the psychological thriller with supernatural elements area. This book also seems a bit different than other King novels. I really can't put my figure on what made this book seem different from his others, but this book leaned to a very literary side than his other books. (I'm not saying that King's books aren't literary. They are!)<br /> One of the things about this book that is so great were the characterizations. Paul Edgecombe is a likeable and believable protaganist as he has his faults and his problems. Some characters, particularly the snobbish Percy, are very hateable, yet you may feel a bit sympathetic for him at times. The murderersthat are waiting to \\"walk the Green Mile\\" can be felt for as King puts you in their footsteps. John Coffey is one of Stephen King's best characters as you can feel for him on an emotional level.<br /> This book is basically a fictional memoir of Paul Edgecombe as it is written in the first person and the book switches a few times to Paul's life at his nursing home. The book takes place when Paul is a senior citizen. This is another masterpiece by one of the greatest authors of all time. This is a definite must read.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-24
US	48100764	R24WG8Y9W253CQ	0345314255	643750532	The Sword of Shannara	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Enjoyable Fantasy	Note: This is an updated review from the one that I wrote in early 2001. I have read through the book again and have developed a different opinion than my previous one, which was an unfair one. Enjoy.<br /> \\"The Sword of Shannara\\" is one of the classics of the fantasy genre. It is one of the first epic fantasies (or high fantasy, if you will) that were written after \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Because of this the book has developed a love over the years because it was the first bestselling fantasy novel to make a major bestseller list and fans of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" were looking for something just like it. And that's what this novel is, it's just like \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" However, I will get into a defense for this book later on in this review, so watch out for that. <br /> As for the plot of this adventurous novel, this is it: In Shady Vale, a little area of Brooks' fantasy world, Shea and Flick Ohmsford are living enjoyable lives. When the mysterious Druid, Alannon, comes to find Shea, they are scared. Shea is told about the Warlock Lord and how he is plotting to win over the races and rule the world. The ancient sword, named The Sword of Shannara, is able to kill the Warlock Lord. The sword can only be used by a relative to Jerle Shannara, a long dead elf of old times, and this person happens to be Shea Ohmsford. Along with a band of other people, dwarves, elves, and men, Shea sets out to find The Sword of Shannara and to kill the Warlock Lord. <br /> Many of the characters in the novel are extremely well written, while others are just the typical heroes that can be found in much of fiction. Shea and Flick are probably the most developed characters as we are able to get inside their heads. Alannon is a Gandalf-like figure but is a very cool character to read about. His mysticism is something that makes you drawn to him. Some of the villains that play big parts in the book are well developed, too. But then there are the characters that are just put in on the sideto get some sword fighting in, like a few of the people in the group that set out on the quest for The Sword of Shannara. These characters are people that are not easily cared about and played minor roles, not neccesarily \\"filler\\" ones, though.<br /> This novel is very similar to \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" but that didn't bother me. I found the complelling characters likeable and I wanted to know what would happen to them, so this was one aspect that kept me reading. Many of the characters shade Tolkien's characters, as well as plot devices, locations, and the general plot. Terry Brooks was a huge fan of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and I feel that he was writing this novel in reverence to Tolkien. ... So, read this book as an enjoyable fantasy adventure, don't pick at every little thing that is similar to Tolkien.<br /> Brooks' writing is very enjoyable to read. This novel flows along very quickly and before you know it you'll have these 700 plus pages finished; I know I did. \\"The Sword of Shannara\\" is an enjoyable fantasy classic. It is not a masterpiece, but it is thoroughly enjoyable. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-19

Fans of fantasy novels, R.A. Salvatore's &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; is a series that stands on its own in the world of sword and sorcery type fantasy. Salvatore here has weaved a great yarn that will keep you entertained from the riveting start of book one, &quot;Homeland,&quot; to the great ending to the third and final book, &quot;Sojourn.&quot; This edition of the books is a big trade paperback that contains all of the trilogy in one easy to read format. This is a great buy for fans of the series or for anyone that is looking to read the novels. And a word of warning: there may be very minor spoilers ahead.<br /> The story that &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; tells is that of Drizzt Do'Urden. Drizzt is a dark elf, an elf with dark skin and white hair, and he lives in the Underdark in the city of the Drow (the city that all Dark Elves live in), Menzoberranzan. The first book of the trilogy relays Drizzt's upbringing and how he was trained in school. The second book tells about his life on the outside of Menzoberranzan in the dangerous Underdark. In book three, which I find to be the best book of the series, Drizzt finally leaves the Underdark and gets to the surface of the world. His adventures up there are truly amazing.<br /> Drizzt is a superb character that is three dimensional, very likeable, and easy to identify yourself with. Drizzt is different from his fellow Drow in that he has different beliefs. When he is out of Menzoberranzan we see him relate with other people and we see how he is rejected most of the time. This is realistic as many people in today's world may feel rejected by certain people. For those people you won't be sulking and saying 'why do I have to be like this?' as Salvatore shows Drizzt grow and adapt to the other people and his enviroments. This is excellent reading and many of the themes on people that Salvatore includes in the book are little lessons on life.<br /> Furthermore, between each of the mini parts of each of the threenovels Salvatore includes journal entries from Drizzt. These entries are truly wonderful to read as they are commentaries on things such as religon, friends, love, and life. It is great to see how Salvatore includes such important little things in the book as they can make your reading a little bit more enjoyable.<br /> &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; is some of the best fantasy in the genre today. This is one of the better fantasy series that I've read and this is so because of the great character of Drizzt Do'Urden. This trilogy will definitely be enjoyed.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-14

I am a fan of Stephen King but had taken a break from him; not because I was tired of him but because I needed to relax after his intense plots, remarkable characters, and superior writing. When I decided to get back in Stephen King's writing I started with this book, &quot;Needful Things.&quot; I was astonished by how complex the plot was, with literally about ten to fifteen characters, and how King kept it moving quickly making you turning pages and pages, and before you know it you'll be done with this humongous novel that is epic in scope.<br /> Welcome to Castle Rock, Maine, Stephen King's fictitious town which has held many previous King novels. The book opens up with a prologue type of chapter that describes the town and the people in it. King's vivid imagination is put to use here as he describes many of the characters that will be met later on in the book. Then there is a sign on a store that will be opening soon. The store is called Needful Things. The residents of Castle Rock are all wondering what the store will be like and for the first few pages we understand the characters thoughts about the store. Leland Gaunt is the owner of the store and he sells whatever the customer desires. Whether it is a baseball card, a picture, or an antique. Gaunt charges a small price for everything, but the customers must do a command that is assigned to them. Mr. Gaunt has a whole plan up his sleeve, one that can capture all of the souls of Castle Rock for himself...<br /> One of the best aspects about the novel are the characters. There really isn't one main character as King switches to the stories of many of Castle Rock's residents revolving around what is going on with Needful Things. Because of this the reader isn't stuck with only one viewpoint. We get to see enemies' thoughts through both eyes, which makes the reader have to choose between right and wrong. The reader isn't stuck with the author's take on the scene; that's up to you. Leland Gaunt is the perfect multi-dimensional villain. At times he may seem as the good guy who is trying to help everybody, but then he'll seem like the bad guy that is out to hurt everybody else. In addition to this villain every other character in this book is three dimensional, such as Sherrif Alan Pangborn, Polly, Nettie, Brian Rusk, Ace, and many others that are worth reading about.<br /> To put it simply, Stephen King is a genius when it comes to writing a well crafted novel. This book contains everything that makes a book great. He includes character development, plot development, description, and wonderful writing. This novel flows very quickly and despite its length you will have this superb novel completed in no time. I guarantee you that it will be nearly impossible to put this book down. &quot;Needful Things&quot; works as a thriller or as a novel involving the paranormal. King makes the novel very realistic.

US	48100764	R1NA0DT14Y70VU	0812551389	705935030	The Skystone (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 1)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A Different Take on the Arthurian Legend	Upon the completion of Jack Whyte's &quot;The Skystone&quot; I was amazed by the originality of the story. Many authors take the Arthurian story and just tell it again in their own words. This is not the case for jack Whyte's epic. In fact, Whyte here starts his own Arthurian story as he starts from before King Arthur's time, in a time where the Romans are about to lose their control of Britian. Whyte's story is compelling and complicated and weaves like a luch epic. <br /> The novel, which is the first in the epic series the Camulod Chronicles, by the way, is told in the first person through the eyes of Publius Varrus. Varrus is a Roman soldier and &quot;The Skystone&quot; tells his story during an important historical time for Britain. The book opens up with a raid against the British, and Varuus befriends military general Brittanicus. With a group of soldiers they are on the run and get into many brawls. Varrus then takes his own path and goes to his hometown to take over his family business of metal working. Varrus is then on the move again and eventually falls in love with a woman. From the beginning to the end &quot;The Skystone&quot; entertains.<br /> The greatest aspect of this whole novel is the realism of the events. Similar things did take place back during the ages when Rome was in control of much of Europe and this historical novel, or historical fantasy if you will, holds up to the first part of it's name in being historical. The reader will learn much on the Roman army and how it functioned and much about Britian during this fascinating time in history.<br /> The major thing that I didn't like about the book were the characters. I found most of the characters to be one dimensional, and while likeable, I couldn't care for any of them. Even though we are put into Publius Varrus' shoes, as the book is told in first person, there is still not any substance in which to develop any &quot;bonding&quot; with the character, and the other characters as well, for that matter. This is the reason that I detracted one star from this otherwise great novel.<br /> This book is an Arthurian novel but doesn't even introduce anybody like Arthur or Merlin. This is the tale of Varrus, who is a grandfather of Arthur, and this is the beginning of how he and his men make the Britain that is the medieval setting of King Arthur's court. One interesting thing that Whyte touches upon is the Lady of the Lake. Whyte's view of this figure of Arthurian fiction is a very interesting one.<BR> <BR> Despite its flaws &quot;The Skystone&quot; is a master of the historical novel. Jack Whyte weaves an interesting tale full of politics, intrigue, and a bit of adventure to keep you happily turning pages. This is a must for any fan of Arthurian fiction. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-11

I picked up this book, the prequel to the whole \\"Shannara\\" series, \\"The First King of Shannara.\\" From the first few pages of this superb epic I was drawn in to the lush characters, great world, and interesting plot. The novel has a certain tone to it, one that makes Brooks' writing seem very unique. Brooks tells the story here in an easy to read way that is simple yet seems very complex. <br />Evil is stirring in the world and the Warlock Lord is gathering races to try to take over other races and get the world for himself. When one Druid, Bremen, warns his peers at the castle Paranor about the stirring evil, they don't believe him. Bremen, along with Druids Risca and Tay, Borderman Kinson, and Druid apprentice Mareth, they set out to try and fight the coming evil in the world. Through many exciting battles, magical duels, and suspense you will be on one of the best fantasy rides of your life!<br />Terry Brooks here gives rich characters full of mysticism, wonder, adventure, and fun. All of the characters are original people of many different races. Because of the amount of main characters in the book, about four or so, the reader will be constantly entertained and boredom will never come. Furthermore, the characters in \\"First King of Shannara\\" have their weaknesses and their strengths making them believable. For example, the character of Jerle Shannara doesn't think that he is capable of carrying out and appointed task, but as he grows he can prove himself wrong. This is the same with many other characters as well.<br />For fantasy readers that don't like the traditional sword and sorcery fare, then this book may not be for you. This novel has many of the traditional fantasy races, such as goblins, gnomes, trolls, elves, dwarves, you get the picture. This book is also high on magic. This book also has some clichés, such as the Skull Bearers, servants of the Warlock Lord. These creatures are just like the Ringwraiths of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" But then again, most books have borrowed some element from another book, so this didn't bother me too much. <br />For somebody that is looking for an interesting and fun fantasy adventure, \\"The First King of Shannara\\" is recommended. I am now looking forward to reading more of Terry Brooks' fantasy novels in the \\"Shannara\\" series.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-08
US	48100764	R2T81J2YDKTLRV	0446603503	340203026	Superstitious	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not Bad, Not Great	This is popular author R.L. Stine's debut in the adult fiction world as he is most famous for his \\"Goosebumps\\" and \\"Fear Street\\" series, which are both aimed at kids and teenagers. As with Stine's previous works, he is not a master of the craft with intricate plots, great characters, and development. Stine writes novels that are mostly plot driven, leaving out a lot of character development and details. This is great for a reader that is not looking for the latter but readers that do enjoy this stuff should seek entertainment with a different book.<br /> Sara Morgan is a woman that lives in a college town and is seeking work, so she takes a job with the dean of students at the university. She then starts seeing a professor at the school, Liam, an Irish born guy that believes in superstitions. Meanwhile, there are many gruesome, terrible murders taking place in the town and an investigation is started. This novel takes you into the affair of Sara and Liam and parts of the investigation.<br /> If you are looking for a thriller that is very involved with the police investagations then this book is not for you. As far as Stine gets with the police stuff is taking you to the scene of the crime and describing lots of gore. Stine's writing is very easy to read though it does come off as very childish at times. This is an easy book to zip right through because of this, but for readers looking for entwined and detailed writing should look somewhere else.<br /> One of the problems I had with the book was the lack of depth. Everything in the book was presented very quickly and Stine never dug deep enough to make the reader feel involved with the story on an emotional level. Instead of getting in touch with major plot events in the book the reader will be pulled into graphic sex scenes, which may be a bit much for certain readers. In fact, much of this book reads like an erotic novel do to the amount of sex and how Stine describes it. I wasn't bothered by this but I am certainthat more sensitive and younger readers may. <br /> Furthermore, the characters in \\"Superstitious\\" are not developed much, leaving the reader with a feeling that gives off a type of incompleteness. I like to read about characters that are well developed and make you care about them, but that was just lacking here. Sara is a likeable character but she just comes off as being too good. There is not much to identify with Sara.<br /> Overall, \\"Superstitious\\" lacks the depth to make it great. This is an enjoyable novel that can be read very quickly as it has short chapters and is easy to read. If you're looking for a quick little beach read, this will be good for that.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-05
US	48100764	R1HXBDQLXR90ON	1573222259	608984993	Across the Nightingale Floor (Tales of the Otori, Book 1)	Books	5	15	19	N	N	Great Read	&quot;Across the Nightingale Floor&quot; is an original, intoxicating read. Lian Hearn is a skilled writer that has done enough research on ancient Japanese customs and systems to present an original world that mirrors that of ancient Japan's. Although there is a tiny bit of magic, which never overpowers the novel and its characters, this story reads like a historic adventure with many interesting characters and events. In fact, the customs, people, and story of this novel are very realistic and the author writes as if everything that is being told could have happened. Furthermore, since many things are based on ancient Japan, what's to say that events that are similar to the book's couldn't have happened?<br /> The book is told mostly in the first person by the young boy Takeo, though some chapters are about a different character, Kaede. The story opens up with Takeo's village being sacked and he is an orphan. Takeo is rescued by Lord Otori Shigeru and is taught many things. The Otori are one of the clans of the world that are in this book. Kaede is a young beauty that is being held hostage and is leading a sad life. As the book progresses we learn how Kaede is going to be married with Lord Otori so two houses will be allies, leaving only one for the conqueror Iida to have to fight. Will eveything go as planned? Read the book and you'll see. The novel is a treat to the imagination as it opens up new thoughts in your head.<br /> In this novel Hearn develops mostly rich characters, especially the two main characters, Takeo and Kaede. Each of these characters receive their own chapters to tell about what's going on at certain points. Since Takeo's part of the story is told as a first person narrative we experience more of a likeability for him. Through each of the character's personal feats and/ or defeats the reader will feel more for the character. Other side characters are interesting to read about as well, such as Lord Otori, Kenji, and many of the mysterious servants, such as Shizuka. <br /> One of the great aspects about this novel is the sense of wonder that you will develop. Not everything is told to you so a lot is left for you to think about and decide for yourself. The world that the story takes place in is obviously very similar to Japan, but not many minute details are described. This is one of the downfalls to the book for those readers that enjoy lush, exotic details. Another downside to the book is that some of the chapters can be quite long to readers that enjoy quick little chapters. This didn't bother me, though, as there was a lot going on in each of the chapters.<br /> Lian Hearn's writing is simple to read and flows quickly, making for a very quick read. Despite the flaws of the book this is still a fun and fast paced adventure. For fans of historical fiction, adventure, or a good read will find &quot;Across the Nightingale Floor&quot; a lot of fun. I am eagerly looking forward to Hearn's next novel in the &quot;Tales of the Otori&quot; series.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-09-03

Salvatore here brings his superb \\"Dark Elf Trilogy\\" to a close. This novel is without a doubt the best of the series. This novel is different from \\"Homeland\\" and \\"Exile\\" in that it takes place out of the Underdark, on the surface of the world. Because of this Salvatore's writing is explored in a new way as he describes the nature and surroundings around the main character, Drizzt Do'Urden, where in the first two books of the series Salvatore's descriptions were not as used as they were in this novel.<br /> Drizzt has reached the world beyond the Underdark, which turns out to be an interesting place for Drizzt. From the beginning of the book when Drizzt is spotted he is thought to be a villain with the intention of making the world a bad place. Drizzt is accused as the murderer of a whole family and is being chased by a ranger, Roddy McGristle. Meanwhile, the orcs are considering Drizzt a threat and are about to make war against him. While Drizzt is out in the wild of the worlds he meets Montolio (or Mooshie) who is a ranger. Montolio teaches Drizzt history and skills to survive in the world and shows Drizzt how he is really a ranger. Montolio is a great friend and advisor. Together Drizzt and Montolio battle an army of orcs. This is not the end of the story as there is much to be told by Salvatore, but I won't tell you about that; go ahead and read the book.<br /> This book is not a clone of J.R.R. Tolkien's works as it offers an original plot and great characters. This book does, however, include many of fantasy's creatures, such as orcs, goblins, dwarves, giants, and much more. You get the idea. This didn't bother me, though, as all of the creatures took on interesting characters. <br /> Not many trilogies in the fantasy genre have kept me as entertained, as moved, and full of wonder as R.A. Salvatore's \\"Dark Elf Trilogy.\\" To get the full impact of the story that is told here I advise you to go ahead and read the first two books of this trilogy before gettingon to this one.

US	48100764	R15VH3CLS2561V	0880389206	5618724	Exile: Forgotten Realms (The Dark Elf Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fabulous	\\"Exile\\" is the second book in \\"The Dark Elf Trilogy\\" and is even better than book one of the series. This novel is more riveting than book one as there is much more action; many more characters, likeable ones and villains; and Drizzt only gets better as a character here. The pages just fly by in this remarkable novel and before you know it you'll be done with it. \\"Exile\\" happily kept me turning pages due to many things. Here are some of the reasons why.<br /> The plot of this book picks up right where book one ended. As the title of this book suggests, Drizzt Do'Urden is in exile from his home of Menzoberranzan. He is now a drifter in the underworld and is living a life of adventure. Meanwhile, back in Menzoberranzan, his mother, Matron Malice, is being told that the Spider Queen Lloth wants Drizzt sacrificed. She sends out a ghost (I won't tell you who) to hunt him down. Back in the wild of the Underworld Drizzt befriends the gnome race and becomes a good friend of the gnome Belwar. Belwar and Drizzt travel through the Underworld through many adventures to get from the Spider Queen. This action packed and fast moving plot make this novel one to be savored.<br /> In book one Drizzt Do'Urden is established as one of fantasy's best characters. Through Drizzt's many adventures here we see Drizzt grow and grow to be a mature, well rounded Drow, unlike his kin. Belwar makes a great companion to Drizzt in this novel, and while not as good of a character as someone like Sam Gamgee of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\"he is still well developed on very likeable. <br /> In \\"Homeland,\\" the first book of this sensational trilogy, the gnomes are depicted as evil and vile creatures because they are seen from the point of view of the majority of the Drow. Since Drizzt is different from the other Drow we see the true side of the gnomes because he takes the chance to get to know them, leaving out all stereotypical thoughts. Drizzt's actions in this book are ones to learn from and how many people should behave. People don't need to be put down because of ethnicity or what not, but how they are as people. That is what Drizzt does here. Because of this R.A. Salvatore puts in this little tid bi on life, among many others which are too many to account here. <br /> People who have read book one of the trilogy should definitely read \\"Exile.\\" I have found Exile to be a better read than book one due to the reasons above, which are just a few of the great things in this book. After you have read this book make sure that you have the third and final book of the trilogy on hand. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-08-22
US	48100764	R2V03K06IDL0MX	0880389052	243097701	Homeland (Forgotten Realms)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Fantasy At It's Best	I was hesitant to pick up \\"Homeland\\" because it is part of the \\"Forgotten Realms\\" series, which at first seemed to me to be a big fantasy world that was full of many cliches and no originality. I cannot believe that I thought this as R.A. Salvatore delivers an orginal, entertaining, and fast paced read here. This the first novel of \\"The Dark Elf Trilogy\\" by Salvatore and this trilogy is now one of my favorites. As other reviewers have stated, R.A. Salvatore has a distinct writing style that is keen on detail, character development, world building, and full of talent. <br /> The main race in this novel is the Drow, who are dark elves with black skin and white hair. Most of the other races find the Drow to be a terrible race with bad habits and lots of evil. The Drow live beneath the surface of the fantasy world that we learn more about later in a city called Menzoberranzan. There are many houses in the city and the book opens up with House Do'Urden destroying another house so that they can be closer to being able to hold much power. On this night Matron Malice, the head of the house, gives birth to Drizzt Do'Urden. This book is the story of Drizzt's first years as he trains to become a warrior, then going to school. We learn that Drizzt is different from other Drow in that he holds a different view on everything and is against many things of the Drow. As the series progresses into the next novel we learn more of this.<br /> Drizzt Do'Urden is one of the best fantasy characters that have ever been written. It is entertaining to see him grow throughout the novel to the person that he really is. Drizzt has his weaknesses and his strengths, and everything is clearly defined here. While Drizzt is the main character and the most likeable of the Drow, the other characters are well developed too. For example, his mother Matron Malice is done well, and so is Zaknafein, one of Drizzt's mentors. <br /> In addition to specific characters being interesting, the race of the Drow is interesting. Their social structure and how they function is amazingly interesting while being very believable. Their religon in their worship of the Spider Queen, Lloth, is interesting to see. Everybody is always trying to please their goddess. The city that the Drow live in is interesting as well, and furthermore, the whole Underworld functions just like a real world, with many races, ways to survive, issues, and much more. <br /> The amount of things that are packed into this little novel is amazing; and this is just book one of the trilogy. The rest of the series gets more amazing as it progresses, so definitely do not stop with this book. R.A. Salvatore is a skilled writer and his skills are evident here. \\"Homeland\\" is a superb start to \\"The Dark Elf Trilogy.\\" <br />Happy Reading!	2002-08-20
US	48100764	R3JF85Y7RJVZPT	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	5	0	15	N	N	Riveting Thriller	Not many thrillers have done what Tom Clancy's \\"Red Rabbit\\" has. This book kept me happily turning pages hour upon hour until I reached the climactic ending. You're probably thinking that a ton of books could do that. They can, but not as good as Tom Clancy has done here. Some novels are just mysteries that involve a simple murder and don't get into technicalities and what not. \\"Red Rabbit\\" is a techo thriller that, like Clancy's previous novels, includes a lot of information on foreign countries, international politics, government agencies and the way that they are run, and many other interesting things. While getting ultimate entertainment in this book you will learn a plethora of things on what was listed above. <br /> Tom Clancy fans know the character of Jack Ryan as the president or the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This book takes place way before Ryan's career took off as in this book he has a job as an analyst at the CIA. In addition to the character of Jack Ryan there are many other main characters such as Ed Foley, a worker at the US Embassy in Russia, many of the good guys of both English and American intelligence agencies, and Russian terrorists. All of the characters are three dimensional and are very believable. Tom Clancy shows many of the characters' work and family lives, which add to the depth of each character. <br /> The plot of this book is as follows. Russian terrorists feel that the Catholic Pope can be a threat to their country because of a certain communication between the Pope and Poland. In addition, a few of Russia's past leaders felt that the Pope should be killed. Because of this a terrorist group plans a plot to assassinate the Pope. Will the good guys stop the assassination attempt? Read this great book and find out.<br /> As with other novels by Tom Clancy he has come up with a scenario that can possibly happen. While this story is not as extreme as some of his others in a sense of the future of the world, this bookstill presents a scary scenario, though. Clancy's writing is simple and easy to read and never gets bogged down with unneccesary passages. I felt that the plotting in this book was done very well and that not one word was wasted. Everything in the book pertained to the plot which makes for a great read.<br /> Fans of Tom Clancy, thrillers, or anyone that finds the plot of this book interesting is in for a treat. \\"Red Rabbit\\" is a fast paced novel that will definitely be enjoyed. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-08-08

The book is a short novel but due to the amount of plots, characters, and scenes this book seems like it is much longer as it feels like a massive epic. The novel goes by very quickly and it will seem that you're done with the book in absolutely no time. The novel is the first book of an epic fantasy series, titled \\"The Riddle Master Trilogy,\\" and due to my fondness of this book I will most definitely read the next to books of the trilogy.<br /> Morgon of Hed is a Riddle Master (read the book to see what these are) that has three stars on his head. Morgon has no clue what the stars represent and when he takes a trip and discovers that he is the only one that can play a harp with the same three stars that are on his forehead, he is curious to see what the stars mean. Meanwhile, darkness is brewing in the world and shadow figures that look like people he knows are trying to kill him. Morgon takes a quest with friend Deth to see what Morgon's stars are about. Along the way Morgon learns a lot about the world that he lives in.<br /> As with other books by Patricia McKillip the world in the book is very original and is not cliched with elements from other novels. Everything in her world is astoundingly original, especially the Riddle Masters. Morgon's quest in the world is very believable and does not seem like a dumb quest with no purpose. I'm sure that the next two books of the series will advance on the importance of Morgon of Hed's quest. <br /> Morgon is a hero that everybody can relate to. He is in a world where there are problems and things that happen to him have effects on him, good and bad. Morgon is developed very well and is very, very believable. Other characters that pop in the book, such as Deth, are believable as well and are well developed. <br /> McKillip's descriptions and prose are, as always, superb. It is a true pleasure to read about what is goingon because of McKillip's easy to read writing style. Children and adults will enjoy \\"The Riddle Master of Hed\\" equally. This is a very original fantasy novel that any lover of the genre will appreciate. This is easily one of the better fantasy novels that have been written.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-08-04
US	48100764	R2RZ4MEY6AXGZT	044100895X	937988765	Ombria in Shadow	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Starts Off Well, But Falls Flat	For a novel that started off so great with such promise, I was a bit disappointed to give \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" just three stars. Patricia McKillip is a very skilled writer and her writing talent is clearly evident in this book but somewhere towards the end I lost all interest in the book. It's not that the book was a chore to finish but as I kept getting towards the end I was wondering where the story was going. I didn't know if McKillip would throw in a plot twist or what, but I found the last third or so of the book to be inferior to the rest.<br /> The novel takes place in Ombria, the greatest city in the world. When the book opens up the reader will learn how the prince of Ombria lies dying and his son, who happens to be a young boy, is the next, and last in the Greve family, in power for the throne. The regent ends up being the evil witch Domina Pearl, also known as The Black Pearl. The main characters of the novel are Ducon, the prince's cousin; Lydea, the prince's former servant and playmate; and Mag, the apprentice to a sorceress in the undercity, a dark area of Ombria full of magic. This novel chronicles all of the characters and how they react with one another, and eventually how everything comes together in the end. <br /> Let me start off with the good that I found in this book. Patricia McKillip is a true master of the craft, with intricate prose, characterizations, and descriptions. It is a joy to read about the city of Ombria and everything that goes on in it, especially that which takes place in the undercity. Most of the characters are completely drawn out and well written, especially the three main characters. McKillip's style is easy to read and feels just like the story is being told to you verbally as everything is simple and just flows along gracefully.<br /> Now, the problems. From the beginning of the novel I was hooked and kept reading thinking that the novel would get better and better as each page moved along. This didn't happen. Everythingseemed to stay the same with not much development in the plot for most of the book. As the last one hundred or so pages dawned on me things started coming together, but when everything was resolved I asked myself, \\"Is that it? It's all done?\\" The ending seemed to be very rushed and and wasn't brought out to it's full potential. I also found that as the story progressed that the plot got very shallow. I thoought that the only depth in the book were the characters.<br /> Despite the negative parts that I found in the book, I still enjoyed the book to a certain degree. This will not be my last book by McKillip. In fact, I look forward to reading a lot more of her works as I saw the potential of her writing here. \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" is not a must read for the general fantasy fan, but can still be enjoyed in that it is pretty original.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-08-01

I was looking for a book that had a collection on certain Greek myths one day and I happened to stumble upon this book. Robert Graves here put together a collection of Greek myths in his own retelling and this book makes for a fun read. In addition to the fun that this book brings there is also a lot of basic information on Greek mythology to be learned, such as the Olympian Gods and monsters of the ancient myths. Whether the book is enjoyed slowly by reading one story and reading another at a later time or gobbling it up all together you will still get a lot of fun and information out of it.<br /> A lot of the basic stories that have come out of Greek mythology are retold here in a simple and easy to read format. Stories such as Heracles' (Hercules), the birth of the God Hermes, Perseus', and many more can be found here. This book combines the politics, mystery, and magic of the ancient Greek world. Of the twenty seven stories that are told in this short little book my favorite is definitely the story of Heracles. I enjoyed reading about how he was able to perform the feats that were given to him to gain his freedom as his story shows how in the end you can always manage to do something that you set out to do.<br /> While reading this book you will notice how the huge cast of characters interact with one another. Many are against each other, many are involved in a love affair, and others team up with each other to defeat other characters. It is interesting how our world today mirrors the mythological world of the ancient Greeks. A lot of people today do the same things that were done by the characters in the stories of the book. <br /> Robert Graves' knowledge of the Greek myths is absolutely astounding. It is obvious upon the reading of this book how much research, time and effort went not only into writing this book, but also into gaining the basic facts which make the stories. In the introduction Graves writes how many things that are in today's world were derived from the ancient Greeks, like astronomy, literature, and medicine. When you read the book keep an eye out for the things of the Greeks that we use today. <br /> I will be reading many of the stories in this book that I have enjoyed again and again in the future. This is a great introduction to the basics of Greek mythology and are great stories for bedtime. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-07-25

I don't know if it's his crazy mind and jokes or what, but everything that I have seen him in has made me laugh my pants my off. Due to my fondness of Mr. Sandler I decided that I would read a biography on him. There were a handful of books written on this talented man, and I'm glad that I picked this one. Crawford here presents facts and stories about Adam Sandler and ties everything together to make a fun filled read that will be thoroughly enjoyed. <br /> The book opens up with a bit on Sandler's family life and some basic biographical information, such as where he grew up and some information on his childhood. After this there are chapters on his \\"Saturday Night Live\\" career, his movies, his CD's, and a plethora of other things. Movies such as \\"Happy Gilmore\\" and \\"Billy Madison\\" are touched upon here. There are plot summaries and many stories about things on the makings of the movies, such as tid bits on the actors and actresses and things about the production. All of the CD recordings that Adam has done are summarized here and there is even some information on specific songs. <br /> Bill Crawford does what a skilled author doing a biography should do. He makes facts fun and interesting to read. But even more inmportantly, though, is that he carefully writes about Adam as a person. He shares information about his family life and hos friends that were made over the years. There is also information here on Sandler's love interests as well. And behind all of the money and fame, Crawford writes how this actor really acts for the love of the art and to please his fans. <br /> The writing in this biography is clear and easy to follow, making for a quick and informative read. This biography is not one that is long and drags, giving pointless information on frivolous things, this will deliver the important information on Mr. Sandler. At the end of this biography there is a complete bibliography and list of Adam's television appearances, movies made, and CD's recorded. This is one biography that will not disappoint.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-07-23
US	48100764	RCSZQZPIK7MWN	0312179383	114427106	Led Zeppelin (Virgin Modern Icons)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Nice Coffee Table Book	In my opinion, Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock and roll band of all time. I stumbled upon this little book in a bookstore for a cheap price, so I decided to purchase it. This is not a book that documents the origins, members, etc. of the band in detail. This is a book that can be easily read in no more than ten to fifteen minutes as it is under 100 pages and the text is spread out, and most of it falls on every other page. <br /> The majority of this little book is made up of quotations from the bandmembers, magazine and newspaper writers, and peers of Led Zeppelin. There is not a lot of text that comes directly from the author, but that's okay. I enjoyed reading the thoughts and impressions of many people on the band during the time that Led Zeppelin was popular. <br /> The introduction by Tony Horkins is well done and is probably the best part of the book text wise. The introduction is twelve pages long and documents the beginning of the band, starting with Jimmy Page. Horkins just writes his thoughts on the band, which are positive, of course. As said above, the majority of the book is made up of quotes, with a limited amount of general comments by somebody, who I assume is Tony Horkins. <br /> If you need one reason to purchase this book then the photographs should be that reason. The pictures are in both black and white and color, and are full of exceptional quality. Most of the photos show the bandmembers performing at concerts, although there are a few still shots of the guys.<br /> This is a very quick read that will be enjoyed and will be looked at over and over again in the future. This book is a nice keepsake to show friends and family, and would make a great gift for a Led Zeppelin fan as well.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-07-23

Le Guin has a very distinctive tone that shines out and makes the book different from other works of fantasy. From the opening page you see how Le Guin is like a storyteller that is reading or telling something to you, as the story that is being told is very descriptive and easy to follow. This makes this novel a classic of the fantasy genre, among other things which will be discussed later on.<br /> Our main character, Ged (Sparrowhawk) is a resident of Earthsea, a huge world of islands. He is blessed with a gift in magical arts, and he is sent to work as a prentice of Ogion, the master wizard of Gont. Ged feels that he is leading a humdrum life with Ogion and doesn't think that he is learning anything that could advance his gift in magic. Ged decides to go to a wizardry school on the island of Roke to study with other young men of his age. But before he leaves Ogion, Ged attempts a spell and unleashes a shadow that will follow him and try to take over his soul. When Ged gets to the school he makes a very good friend, Vetch. After graduating from the wizardry school Ged goes and fights dragons and does a few other things, but mainly is trying to defeat the shadow that is trying to take over him. Up until the climactic finish that will leave you ready for the following \\"Earthsea\\" books, this novel will entertain.<br /> In a way this book is a lesson on life. The novel shows how our main character, Ged, goes through the first stages of his life and must cope with things that come up. At the wizardry school he must deal with the vile Jasper and come over this boy's tauntings. When he travels on a boat throughout the sea he has to survive and cope with stresses from the shadow. This book shows how people could overcome the odds when everything seems like it is going against them.<br /> Most of the novel is descriptive and there is not a whole lot of dialogue, which I happen to love. Although Le Guin's writing style may get a bit tedious at times this book was written by a master of not only fantasy, but also the English language, so the book is still great. <br /> That said the description of the novel makes the book feel very realistic. Le Guin's world is very believable and is fun to read. In addition, the characterisation for the main character Ged is wonderful and I'm sure that as the series progresses I (and you, if you pick up this book) will feel more for him. <br /> \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a short novel but don't think that this book isn't good because it is not as long as other epic fantasies. In fact, it is better than most of today's fantasy. I am wholeheartedly looking forward to reading the next two novels in this trilogy, and possibly the others of the series.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-07-11

This was actually my first non fiction book by Dave, and in this book he continues with the same comedy that can be found in his columns.<br /> \\"Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway\\" is a book about the American government and includes things on American history and comes all the way to today's politics. The first chapter is about the origins of government, and starts with the cavemen and continues to people like the Romans and Greeks. In this chapter Barry shows how government originated by introducing some very funny concepts. Chapter two is about the United States of America being born and includes things on colonial life. In this chapter you read the Constitution according to Dave, which is hilarious. Next, in chapter three, Dave Barry describes today's government and talks about the departments that make up the government. His views on the United States departments are very funny. Chapter four gives a tour of the U.S. Capital, Washington, D.C. This is one of the funniest parts of the book. The fifth chapter describes the presidential election process. Chapter six is a funny chapter that shows what a political campaign is like by showing how the candidates trash one another and how elections can be corrupt. Chapters seven and eight tell about the year 2000 election and then go into telling about South Florida. The parts about South Florida were especially funny since I read about how corrupt the area that I live in is.<br /> As the title suggests, Dave Barry hits below the beltway with his humor. It is great to read about how he views the United States government and then giving ideas that may be rational to him on everything. Dave Barry's opinions on America's politicians and lawyers are funny as he informs you in a funny way about how corrupt they are. The last two chapters, which are mainly on South Florida, are hysterical as Barry tells what a corrupt area of the country this is. For people that have never been to South Florida what is stated here is exceptionally funny.<br /> All of the jokes in the book, with the exception of the zucchini ones, will have you laughing. I will definitely will be reading more books by Dave Barry, who indeed is \\"the funniest man in America.\\" For plenty of laughs in a fast read, this is the book to read.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-07-03

This book doesn't really have a central storyline as the characters are just crusing throughout the solar system. There is a lot of science in this book, and I'll get to this further on. All of the characterisations in the book are very well done and the characters are three dimensional people that seem very, very realistic.<br /> The Stones are a space family, and the family is made up of father and son Roger, mother and daughter in law Edith, twins Pollux and Castor, grandma, mother, and mother in law Hazel, sister, daughter, and granddaughter Meade, and son, brother, and grandson Lowell. This book is a narrative with many plots as the family goes through certain things. The book starts off with the family buying a space ship, which is named The Rolling Stone. Then the family takes a two year trip through outer space, and plots out there include Lowell getting sick, the twins getting in trouble on Rock City, and a disease epidemic on a space ship that is traveling adjacent to The Rolling Stone. Throughout the book you are entertained because of a fun plot and great characters.<br /> Heinlein did not really put any of his commentaries in his book. This book is just a fun read that will be enjoyed just for the story. However, Robert Heinlein portrays very well family life. He shows how everybody is in disagreement with each other, how problems are solved with compromising, and how each member of the family interacts with one another. You will be able to identify with the characters because you may have (had) some of the same problems and feelings. This is what makes the novel so believable.<br /> As with most of Robert's novels, there are lots of scientific facts. Most of the information is on technology and astronomy. Robert teaches many things that are real and also tells about some of his own theories and technological inventions, which is interesting reading since you can compare real facts and inventions to what Heinlein created. &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; is a great read from start to finish, and is wonderful for science fiction fans or for anybody that finds anything that was stated above interesting.<br />Happy Reading!ological inventions, which is interesting reading since you can compare real facts and inventions to what Heinlein created. &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; is a great read from start to finish, and is wonderful for science fiction fans or for anybody that finds anything that was stated above interesting.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-29
US	48100764	R2PCYUSWF17BZK	0451160525	511631376	The Gunslinger (Dark Tower)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	A Great Start	\\"The Gunslinger\\" is the first book in Stephen King's epic fantasy series, titled \\"The Dark Tower.\\" This book is very, very different from the fantasy that you can pick up in bookstores or purchase at Amazon. This epic has a very different feel to it when you are reading the book. I would say that this book is a western type of fantasy, with particular emphasis on the western part. Most of the book takes place in the desert and villages in it, and this will give the feel that distinguishes this book from others. Stephen King is a master of the English language and his words paint a clear image in your mind.<br /> The book starts off teaching you about the gunslinger, who we later learn is named Roland, is chasing the Man in Black. The book is like a mystery in a way as as the book progresses you learn about the gunslinger's motives and we eventually learn his real obsession. Roland stops at a village and falls in love with a woman. In this part of the story King portrays a romance between the gunslinger and his girlfriend. Later on in the book Roland the Gunslinger meets up with the child Jake, and Jake continues with Roland on his quest to find the Man in Black. At the end of the novel Roland will have to make a hard choice concerning Jake and the Man in Black. The story has a good set up but does come across a bit slow throughout the novel.<br /> Stephen King originally wrote \\"The Gunslinger\\" as five different short stories, and they are all published here as one novel. Each part of the book can be appreciated as a story in itself or as a part of the whole fantasy epic. On another note, King's idea for this book came from Robert Browning's epic poem, \\"Childe Roland.\\"<br /> Roland the Gunslinger is a man obsessed with finding the Man in Black. The last part of the story is defintely the best as you learn lots about why Roland has been following the Man in Black. We learn how Roland is set out to find the Dark Tower, which is supposed to hold a room that is basicallythe control room of all the universes. <br /> King is a greatly talented author and it shows here. King brought an inventive fantasy story and put in many different flavors so this book will appeal to a wide group of readers. As curious as I am to find out more about Roland's quest, I am going to hold off reading the books until the next two books of the series are published, probably next year, so I won't I will be able to read most of the series all at once. This is a masterpiece that shouldn't be passed up.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-25

I received this great book as a gift and it fits my criteria for a book that I would buy. The publishing house that made this book, Dorling Kindersley, has a growing list of references that they publish. \\"Body Facts\\" falls under the pocket references that are put out by the company, and even though it's tiny in size doesn't mean that the information it carries is small as well. <br /> The information in this reference is concise and right to the point. This is a book that won't make you read for pages to get a tiny bit of general information on something. All of the information is apparent and easy to find. When I use a reference I want a lot of information but I don't want it to read like it's a bunch of jumble that I cannot understand. Every written word in this book is written in a manner that a person that is taking in the information for the first time can understand everything.<br /> The book is broken down into six sections, five of which are on certain parts of the human body. There is also a two page introduction to teach you how to use the book. The first section of the book is on body structures, which features the human skeleton, muscles, and joints; the second section is on the brain and nervous system, and includes information on the spinal cord and senses in addition to the information that is on the title of the section. The third section is on heart, blood, and lungs, which also has some information on the endocrine system; The fourth section is on the digestive and excretory systems; The fifth section is on the reproductive section, which has information on genetics; the sixth and final section is a simple reference guide which has nutrition and excercise information, as well as a human body timeline and the traditional index and glossary that is commonplace in many worksof non-fiction.<br /> All of the pictures and diagrams that are in the book are simple to understand, and as said above, the same goes with the actual text. This book is written by an actual doctor, so you are getting this information from a pro that studied everything and much more for four solid years. This is a great addition, or a start, to anybody's medical library.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-23

Heinlein is easily one of the best authors that have published their works, science fiction or not. &quot;Orphans of the Sky&quot; was originally published as two short stories, titled &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Common Sense.&quot; This novel puts the two works together so that they read like one novel, which the two stories really are once they are combined. This is one of Heinlein's juveniles and I have yet to read any of the books that he wrote during the second part of his career, but I really enjoy these books. Heinlein here doesn't get involved with his beliefs as the book is more plot oriented. This doesn't mean that there aren't lots of good messages to learn by reading this, though.<br /> Many, many years after Earth, there is a huge spaceship that flies throughout space. This space shuttle is made up of different stories and it is like a huge planets, with farms, homes, work areas, etcetera. On this planet are two types of people, the crew of the space shuttle, and people that are called &quot;Muties&quot; are the people that live on the upper parts of the ship and are sterotyped as to being violent and dirty people. The crew part of the ship has no clue that the shuttle is even moving and one man, Hugh, tries to tell the crew part of the ship the truth behind everything. The plot may not sound that it would be lots of fun, but it sure is.  <br /> People on the space shuttle are brought up thinking that the shuttle is the only thing in existence and that there is nothing beyond it. Heinlein tries to teach in this novel that you must examine everything and every way possible to prove that something is either correct or incorrect. It took one person of the crew part of the ship to realize the truth, and this is the supreme example that Heinlein shows. This book also shows to fight for what you believe in and to not let anybody get in the way of your goals. These messages in a fiction book are what make Robert A. Heinlein's novels stand out.<br/> This is a very short read that can be quickly read in less than three sittings; for the people that read super fast you can get this done in one. Now that I have read this book I can officially call myself an RAH fan and I definitely rank him up there as one of my favorite science fiction novelists. This is a must read for any fan of science fiction or a fan of Robert A. Heinlein. Books this good shouldn't be passed up.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-21

Clarke and this book was not bad, but it wasn't as good as other science fiction novels that I have read. &quot;The Hammer of God&quot; would have been much more enjoyable if it was cut down to the size of a novella, or even a short story. The book is very, very heavy on science, which is a wonderful thing as I learned a lot. But ultimately, the book is not as good as it promised to be. Hopefully rhe following will give you an understanding as to why I feel this way.<br /> This novel takes place in 2110 in a future that is very possible. An asteroid that is about the size of the state of Colorado is flying towards Earth and if nothing is done to stop the asteroid mankind on planet Earth will probably be no more. Captain Robert Singh and his crew on the space shuttle &quot;Goliath&quot; have been given the task to steer the asteroid out of its course towards Earth. This plot is very interesting and fun but it takes a very long time to finally get to the good parts.<br /> The whole novel starts off well and Clarke is a very skilled writer so the book is a pleasure to read because of his writing skills. However, during the first half of the book all that you read about are scientific facts, which are fun, but it gets to a point that you want some action and you are not getting any. That is why I think that the book would have been much better if it was cut in half. If this was done their still would have been lots of science in the book and the plot and characters would have been more focused on. <br /> One great thing about the book is all of the scientific facts that are present in the book. You mostly learn about astronomy in the book, but you also learn a little on subjects such as physics and geology. The novel is mildly entertaining but don't go into this science fiction expecting a tour de force. A loyal fan of the genre would mostly enjoy this book. The book is fun when you get to the plot, but if you want to be entertainedfrom start to end steer away from this. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-19

Tolkien here gives a fantasy adventure in a long ago Britain that is inhabited by supernatural beasts such as giants and dragons. The book is very short and can be read in one sitting.<br /> Farmer Giles is a farmer of Ham, just as the title of the book suggests. When a huge giant comes into the village that he inhabits one night he fights it off and is recognized by the King. Farmer Giles is given a sword, named Tailbiter, and was used by a long ago hero that was a dragonslayer. When the giant spreads rumors of there being nothing in the lands that he came from to dragons, a curious dragon wanders down toward Ham. It is Farmer Giles' job to take care of the dragon. Read this fun filled fantasy adventure to find out the fate of the dragon and Farmer Giles.<br /> This book is basically one very long chapter as it is not broken down into parts and can be thought of as a little part to a much bigger story. This is what differentiates this book from the classics \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" At the end of the book there is an original text of how the original story was told. There is also a section of notes that were put together for people that are extra curious. The book also has many cute pictures that will get you along through Farmer Giles' adventures.<br /> This is a super short read that can be enjoyed by adults as well as children, who I'd say this book would be liked by most. This simple tale was originally written for J.R.R. Tolkien's children and is like a fun fairy tale. This is a wonderful read that would be enjoyed by fans of Tolkien's other works. Just don't expect another \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" <br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-18

I found this book and it is a true gem. This book will teach you about the breed, whether or not the dog is right for you, and a plethora of other useful information about the dog. Rottweilers are actually one of the most loving breeds of dog that there is and one part of the book will help people to realize that these dog are great dogs that are good with children and people if they are treated and taught well from the first day that you bring your dog home.<br /> This superlative reference is broken up into is broken up into four parts with numerous chapters that fall under that specific topic. The main things that are discussed in this great book are getting to know Rottweilers, where you find out about the dog and whether or not the dog is right for you; the next part is called searching for a soulmate where you get information on knowing what you are looking for in the dog and how to choose what to get; part three of the book discusses how you can keep your Rottweiler in good health by learning about the dog's basic anatomy, feeding and exercise rituals, and health problems; the final part lists ten reasons to own or not to own a Rottweiler, and training and traveling tips. This is a handy reference because of the multitude of topics that are discussed in this book.<br /> I detracted one star from the book because I felt that the training information in the book was not specific and that I didn't get a great deal of information regarding my dog's habits for doing bathroom rituals. I didn't get a lot of information as to how many times a day I should take my dog out and how often my dog should be fed. Because of this I recommend another book in the &quot;Dummies&quot; series on training dogs. <br /> As with all &quot;Dummies&quot; books the information that is found here is concise and to the point, written in an easy-to-read manner. I recommend this great reference to anybody that is looking for information on the Rottweiler breed of dogs. These dogs are one of the most loving creatures to walk the planet but this book is very neccesary. If you do not read this book you may be letting your dog do things that may result in long term problems, behavioral or physical. I will be sure to use this book in the future to take care of my Rottweiler. This is a great reference that is worth buying.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-15
US	48100764	R54U5KP555226	0345353730	2944439	Tunnel in the Sky	Books	5	4	6	N	N	An Awesome Book!!!	\\"Tunnel in the Sky\\" is one of Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile science fiction novels, which he wrote to target the young adult audience. People may think that since this book is targeted at juveniles that it is not a good read for adults. That is untrue and this wonderful novel can be enjoyed by an adult as well as a juvenile. The book takes place in a 1950's or so time where interplanetary travel happens by many people of the public every single day. People move through the planets by going through gates, where they are transferred to a plantet that can be millions of miles away in a matter of seconds. This is a very ineteresting idea that Heinlein brings forth.<br /> Rod Walker is a high school teen that is enrolled in a survial course at his school. For the final exam he and his peers are asked to travel to another planet to stay for a maximum of ten days and survive there. Rod goes and at first is lost and has absolutely no clue where any of his friends are. He eventually meets up with a student from another school and they start a colonization on the planet that they ended up on. The instructors of the course were supposed to get the kids but you will learn at the end of the novel why the kids were never retrieved.<br /> This novel shows how government forms and how it works among the people that are governed over. In the book, a whole new civilization is started on the planet and at first everybody works together to make a habitable living area and to get enough food for everybody. The colony that is formed starts of with just two people and grows to a very large amount of students that were taking the final exam for the survival course. There are elections to elect people to govern over the people of the colony and this book can show how people can start a new life when they need to. Heinlein is a very interesting author to read and it fascinated me how he was able to put in very important messages, such as the importance of working together and believing in yourself, in a fun read.<br /> This is not only a science fiction novel but it is also a book on adventure, friendship, and hark work. This is a wonderful science fiction novel that is worth reading. I look forward to reading more of Robert A. Heinlein's novels in the future. This is a miraculous read that shouldn't be passed up.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-15
US	48100764	RAMCNTS4AUB09	0671877046	92373266	Glory Road	Books	2	7	15	N	N	I Just Didn't Like It	I wish that I could have given \\"Glory Road\\" a better rating but to tell you the truth, I thought that it was terrible. I felt that the whole book in general had no purpose and it did not entertain on any level. The story is a bout Vietnam veteran Oscar who meets a gorgeous woman on a French island. He finds an ad in the paper and goes in to see if he can get the job that is being offered. It ends up that the woman that he met put out the ad and she wants him. He is hired as a hero to go on an adventure to find the Egg of the Phoenix. Sure, the plot sounds promising, but put simply, it's not.<br /> This book has many flaws. You have no clue about the adventure and why Oscar is being dragged to other planets until you are around halfway through the novel. Sure, you want to know what everything's about, but Robert Heinlein just lest everything drag on for way too long and you will become very bored with the book. Less than 100 pages into the book I wanted to stop right there but I kept going thinking that it would get much better. It didn't. As the book moved on, the plot got even more pointless and it got to a point where you wonder why you are reading this piece of drivel.<br /> The characters are one-sided and you won't even care about them. The characters are boring and not even worth reading about. The quest that Oscar, Star, and Rufo (you'll learn about him after the quest is done) seems so pointless. All the characters do is fight monsters and dragons and get in trouble with a lord. This could have been a lot of fun but Heinlein just was not writing as to keep you interested. You do not even find out what the whole plot is about until you are over 100 pages into the book and then after the quest you find out about the signifigance of the egg. <br /> I guess that I am going to have to read more Heinlein to really enjoy his works. \\"Glory Road\\" does have it's rare, good moments and that's why I gave the book 2 stars. This novel is flawed and has no depth, making for a painful and boring read. I really do not recommend this book to any reader; there's a lot better stuff out there.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-13
US	48100764	RDC8S5VWR3UF8	0451457994	379678595	2001: a Space Odyssey	Books	4	1	1	N	N	It Was Wonderful For the Most Part...	&quot;2001&quot; is a wonderful novel about an Earth that is very involved in the solar system and studies it like today's world studies the human body. The book starts off with a prologue type of part that tells how human relatives that lived in the Ice Age found a rock that had to come from extraterrestrial life. From these opening chapters you are drawn into a fascinating science fiction tale.<br /> On Earth's moon, an object that is being dubbed the TMA-I has been found and it is being concealed from the moon's public and Earth's as well. We are then taken to an odyssey, &quot;the&quot; odyssey which the title refers to, as a matter of fact, that is being led by a computer named Hal. When the book starts you don't really know what this odyssey is about, unless you are critical and pick up very apparent things that take place at the beginning of the novel. All that you know is that the ship called the &quot;Discovery&quot; is going to the planet Saturn. This is the premise for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;<br /> This book is very fast paced and this fact makes for an added plus towards your enjoyment of the novel. Arthur C. Clarke is a pretty good author that knows how to weave an intriguing science fiction tale. Clarke thankfully gets into some scientific facts and this is a bonus for readers that have an interest in science, mainly astronomy. <br /> My major qualm with this book is what took place towards the end. I got bored with the novel and couldn't care less for what was going to happen when I was bogged in Clarke's philosophical commentaries. I'm normally not bothered by an author doing this but Clarke just wrote about his feelings so much that hardly related to the plot that I was just plain bored. I'm sure that not all readers will feel the same about Clarke's commentaries as I did, but these are just my feelings. I also think that Clarke's commentaries also got me so bogged down that I couldn't really enjoy the ending, which was very interesting in itself.<br /> &quot;2001&quot; was monumental in the science fiction genre when it first came out and it is ranked as one of the genre's classics today. This is a must read for a fan of science fiction but beware that this book does get boring when Clarke gets into philosophy and what not. This book will most likely be enjoyed and will be worthy of a re-read some time around.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-11
US	48100764	RK57YPY1ZT5I7	038072846X	840982049	Last Call	Books	5	29	31	N	N	An Amazing Tale	Whenever I read a novel I can tell from the first few sentences whether or not I will enjoy the book by judging the author's writing style. From the first few words of Tim Powers' &quot;Last Call&quot; I was drawn in to this captivating story. Tim Powers is a fantasy author but what makes Mr. Powers' novels different from others is that his fantasy novels take place in our world and seem that what goes on really could happen.<br /> Scott Crane was involved in a dangerous card game called Assumption many years ago and he is dreaming of the game. In this game his soul was stolen by the man that started the game. 20 years from when the game took place Scott decides that he wants to get back into playing Poker and Crane has no clue for what is going to happen to him. Scott is biologically the next Fisher King, the mythological king of the tarot card world. When Scott enter Las Vegas the cards are showing that he is in the city and people want him dead. From Vegas to Los Angeles to the Hoover Dam this novel is a tour de force that will keep you riveted from page one.<br /> Tim Powers is a very different type of fantasy author. His fantasies take place in our world and deal with real people just like you and me. The whole fantasy premise of &quot;Last Call&quot; is based on tarot cards and Powers makes you believe that these cards really have meaning and are much more than bogus. Other myths are also used in this book such as some things from King Arthur.<br /> Powers is an amazing author. From the first page of this novel you are grabbed and you will read and read and read until you have come to the ending. All of the characters are three dimensional people that you will care for and will either love or hate. There was just one thing about this novel that I didn't like. In fact, another reviewer brought something up along the lines of what I am going to say. I felt that the book's ending was a bit rushed and that Powers didn't let the ending work itself out. This minor wualm, however, did not make my reading of this book bad and therefore the book will keep five stars despite this.<br /> This is my first Tim Powers novel and it defintely will not be my last. I will never look at tarot cards or regular playing cards the same way since I have read this book. This is the perfect fantasy for somebody that wants an original read.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-09

All of the ideas that are in the stories are great and the stories can be broken down so you can identify themes that Ray Bradbury wanted the reader to learn. <br /> &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was written during the first half of the twenty first century and I'm sure that it is still a fascinating read today as it was when it first came out. Bradbury had all of the stories take place from 1999 all the way to 2026 and it is very interesting to notice how almost nothing that was in Bradbury's futuristic novel has happened thus far in the history of the world. <br /> Most of the stories of this book are very interesting and can be enjoyed whether you read one or two and read none for a while or whether you read the book from cover to cover, enjoying this book like it holds many fragments to what may be a future that can end up happening. The people that make the journey to Mars leave for a variety of reasons. People may be leaving Earth to start a new and better life, to get away from Earth and it's events, to escape being punished for a crime commited on Earth, or to get away from the atomic war that is predicted to happen on Earth. This book holds the stories to the people that make the journey to the red planet and the stories contain just fragments of their lives there. <br /> Bradbury brings forth many issues that may have been very important when the book was written but that are not very important to today's general population. Things that Bradbury brings forward are that one person in the book may find a certain thing okay but are not okay to someone else, human nature and man's want to own all and rule all, and other things such as love. &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is a very important novel for anybody toread. You don't only have to be a science fiction fan to appreciate the important things that this novel teaches. On top of teaching, however, this novel entertains greatly. I gave this novel four stars because I thought that there were a few mediocre stories, but these stories don't really detract from the overall enjoyment of the novel. This is a must read.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-05

Salvatore wrote an absolutely fantastic novelization based on the screenplay for the movie that was written by George Lucas and Johnathan Hales. This was not only the first Salvatore novel that I've ever read but it is also my first venture into the literary Star Wars universe. I was very pleased with the book that Salvatore has written and here's why.<br /> After an assasination attempt on Senator Padme Amidala of planet Naboo, young Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker is assigned to watch over her. He takes Amidala from Coruscant back to Naboo and they start to fall in love. Meanwhile, dark forces are brewing and the Separatists are gaining many new planets to their side every day. The Republic is looking at what may be the first war since it formed and an unknown Clone army is being made for them. It is Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi that finds out about this army as he searches for the person that tried to kill Senator Amidala. This is the basic plot of this amazing book.<br /> This book remains as true to the movie as a book can get but it also has a lot more backbone to the story that was never in the film. The characterisations are great, especially the one for Anakin Skywalker. There is a lot of foreshadowing as to how Anakin will make the drastic change that will happen in Episode 3. The other characterisations are fantastic as well and you feel as if each character is a real person that you know. <br /> Salvatore is a very good writer and I am glad that he was chosen to write this book. He is keen for detail so you will have everything that comes forth in the plot down to every last deatil in your head. He also does a great job of describing each of the planets and cities that are in the galaxy as well. <br /> This is a great read for somebody that has already seen the fantastic movie or somebody that is looking for a wonderful science fiction book. This novel will keep you riveted from page one and from there on you won't be able to stop reading. Because of this book I look forward to reading more books that take place in the Star Wars universe. This is a truly great read.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-04

Most of the book deals with the war between the Merduks and the Torunnans. Unlike the the last book of the series, people such as  Richard Hawkwood, Murad, and Bardolin do make appearances, but this book really centers on Corfe Cear-Inaf. <br /> Corfe is the leader of Torunna's army and is battling a religous war with the Merduks. In the last book the monks Avila and Albrec have brought forth a document that says that Saint Ramusio, the Westerners savior, and Ahrimuz, the Merduks (Easterners) savior, were the same person. This is a fascinating discovery since the enemies really idolize the same God and the war is frivolous due to religous reasons.<br /> The plot of this book made me think about certain things that are going on in our world. There are religous clashes happening today and this book makes you wonder if Paul Kearney borrowed from current events as well as history. Kearney borrows greatly from Renaissance history and this makes for a different feel to the book compared to others. I am used to reading books that take place in the medieval times but this is different as this book has guns and other things that weren't present back in medieval times. <br /> Most epic fantasies are known to be long books that are well over the five hundred page mark. \\"The Second Empire\\" is amazingly under three hundred pages and this book is better than some of the very long stuff that you could read today. Because of this this series would be great for somebody that is not willing to read door stopper size novels. The fourth book of \\"The Monarchies of God\\" is a truly amazing read that will be enjoyed by fans of the series and fantasy fans in general. This is a great read.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-06-02

In &quot;The Iron Wars,&quot; Paul Kearney outdoes what he has done in the first two books of &quot;The Monarchies of God&quot; series. This book is much more political than the first two novels and this has much more military action than them as well. This book opens up with a riveting prologue that will be sure to lure you in to this creative tale. From there you are taken back to the lands of Normannia and its doings.<br /> Even though this book doesn't deal with what is going on on the Western Continent, this book is still great. Most of the novel involves Albrec and Avila and their quest to bring the biography of Saint Ramusio to Macrobius and the war that is being taken place with the Merduks. Therefore, most of this book takes place in Torunna, while some of it takes place in Hebrion's capital, Abrusio. <br /> Kearney's writing skills are superb. Not many author's are capable of doing what Kearney does. He gives you many plots and lots of characters and manages to keep you hooked like a skilled writer should. You won't be bored while reading this book as important events take place one after the other.<br /> This isn't the best fantasy novel that I've ever read but it will certainly leave an impression on me in years to come. If you have read the first two novels of &quot;The Monarchies of God&quot; series then this is the book for you to read. This book will not disappoint and I guarantee that you will enjoy this novel immensely. This is what fantasy is all about it. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-05-31

In book one, the Merduks are trying to take over Western Normannia and the whole Eastern continent is under war. Richard Hawkwood has lead an expedition to the Western continent to help start a new civilization that would be secluded from the war. At the end of book one, you are set up for book two.<br /> Many questions will be answered in this book including these: What will happen to the people that Ricard Hawkwood has lead across the Great Western Ocean? What is going on in Charibon? In Abrusio? What is happening to all of your favorite characters? In addition to the answers that will help resolve your anxiousness to know what is happening you will be riveted due to new plots. <br /> Paul Kearney gives you great characters. The characters in &quot;The Heretic Kings&quot; are not cheesy, one-sided people that you could just tear apart and make fun of. Every character is interesting and can be cared for. From King Abelyn to Corfe, all of the characters are people that you wish that you could know. <br /> There are multiple plot lines and many characters to this great story, but don't let that interfere with your enjoyment of this. Once you are into this you will be hooked and you'll have this novel done very quickly. Before you read this second novel in this series make sure that you have read book one of &quot;The Monarchies of God,&quot; titled &quot;Hawkwood's Voyage.&quot; &quot;The Heretic Kings&quot; will definitely thrill people that have read book one and you will enjoy this novel even more than the first one.

Because of things like this, fantasy can get boring. In Paul Kearney's \\"Hawkwood's Voyage\\" this is not the case. This is a very original novel that is entertaining right from the prologue. <br /> War is raging in the Five Kingdoms and the Merduk army is the main cause of this. The holy city of Aekir, what was the holiest city in the world and was supposed to be one of the strongest cities, has fallen. This is where the novel opens up. Now, the king of Hebrion is starting a voyage to go across the Great Western Ocean to start a whole new colony. The voyage will be lead by mariner Richard Hawkwood. This voyage was done twice before but failed. This is the basic plot of a very original fantasy novel.<br /> This book has lots of main characters which makes this book similar in a way to George R.R. Martin's series. This novel takes place all over the world. Places included are Richard Hawkwood's boat in the middle of the ocean all the way Ormann Dyke, a city that is under the threat of attack. This novel is politically and militarily oriented. The politics are that of the standing of the Five Kingdoms and how the Kings react to what is going on in the world. Military wise, you are taken to battle plannings and actual battles themselves. <br /> This book is not cliched is very suspenseful. This was fun to read while I am waiting for the next book in my favorite series, a series by George R.R. Martin. While this book isn't as detailed as that series it still embodies some of the same attributes as that series, such as good characterisation, good plotting, and suspense. This book would be good for a GRRM fan in addition to anybody that is looking for a highly original book. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-05-25

Martin does an even better job than the first two books of this amazing series. The plot is more riveting than the first two books and this is easily the darkest of the three. This book opens up a while after the events in \\"A Clash of Kings\\" but Martin grabs you like the pro that he is and with his fantastic prose you will be sucked into this rich and complex story.<br /> Many things have happened since the battle on the Blackwater Rush this book starts off with what has been going on. There are many plots and you are introduced to two new charcaters' points of view as well with your old favorites. As said above, this is much darker than the first two novels in this series as Martin starts to kill off many, many characters and dreadful things take place. One of the big questions to ask yourself while reading this is, \\"Who will survive?\\" <br /> Martin is my favorite author and he ha redefined the fantasy genre. He has introduced a whole different type of fantasy epic in a tale of a medieval world that is full of knights, warlocks, princes, princesses, lords, ladies, sailors, kings, queens, and many more. The world that Martin has created is so real that you feel like everything that is happening in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" really took place at some time in history. Each castle, town, city, or kingdom is crafted so well and you will feel like you are there witnessing what is happening. <br /> The detail in this novel is amazing. There is a history and story behind every person, object, or place that you are introduced to. What is different about Martin telling about something compared to another author is that Martin actually makes you have an interest in what he's describing where other authors can bore you to tears. George R.R. Martin's words paint a picture in your mind like no other author's words can. <br /> Before starting this wonderful novel you must be sure that you have read the first two books in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, titled \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords.\\" Througout every page of this novel you will be enjoying the luscious story. This is my number one favorite novel of all time. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series, titled \\"A Feast for Crows.\\" This is a novel that is not to be missed by anybody.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-05-22

Jeanne was put into a concentration camp in the California desert called Manazanar because after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, Japanese people on the Pacific side of the USA were put into the camps. This book is the tale of her life at the camp and how she had to adapt to the changes. Her whole Japanese culture and the traditions were changed upon entering this camp.<br /> This book teaches valuable lessons about racism, culture, society, and many other things. This book is a story that made the American public aware of these concentration camps. The camps were kept secret throughout all of World War II, the time span in which these camps remained open. You also learn about the Japanese culture and how the cultures were destructed when the families were put into the camps. Traditions such as eating together as a family never happened in the camps because families were spread all across the camps. Their food was also not how Japanese people eat. They never mix salty foods, such as rice with sweet ones, such as apricots. In the camps the food was not as they would have eaten it at home. <br /> Since I enjoyed all of these things, you must be asking why I gave this book just three stars. The reason for that is that the book is written very sloppily and it seems that writing skills were never taught to these authors. It is not apparent as to what is taking place because of poor writing. For example, if the writers go back in time to go over family history, you don't have any clue as to what is going on. This was my main qualm with this book.<br /> Despite the lackluster writing, \\"Farewell to Manzanar\\" is enjoyable because teaches moral lessons, such as not to be a racist; and it also teaches you about Japanese cultures. This is good reading for anybody that wants to learn about the concentration camps for the Japanese during World War II. Keep in mind, though, that the writing is not good atall. <br />Happy Reading!	2002-05-21

Martin is easily my favorite author. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" blows almost every book that I've read out of the water because Martin is such an awesome author. This is the second book in the series titled \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" and picks up right after the first book in the series. This novel starts off with a very riveting prologue and then takes us back to our favorite characters and the events that are taking place. <br /> If you haven't read the first book in this series then you may not understand the plot. If this is the case, go to the page for \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and you will be familiar with this series. This book picks up after book one and continues the story that started in the first book. Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon, and Robb Stark are naming themselves the king of Westeros and war has started. This book has a lot of fighting, political intrigue, wonderful characterisation, suspense, and an awesome storyline. Martin really starts to kill off certain characters in this book and the people being killed will be the people that you would think the least of. By the end of this book many things will have changed from the beginning and you will be shocked by the events that took place.<br /> With this book comes more magical things than what was in the first book. Many magical doings take place and are major to the plot. There are no quests and most of this book is based on sword fighting, politics, and a captivating storyline. These things make for a refreshing break from the usual fantasy that you see today. <br /> What makes \\"A Clash of Kings\\" interesting, and the other two novels in this series for that matter, is the way that the story is told. The story is broken up into chapters told from the point of view of the main characters and because of this you are not stuck with the point of view of one character throughout the whole entire story. In adiition to the characters that survived in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" there are twonew characters whose points of views are told. Read this book to see who the new two people are.<br /> For those of you who think that no other book can beat \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" you're wrong. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is only better than the first book because the plot develops more and thickens, you'll become much closer the the characters, and George R.R. Martin writes brilliantly. This book should only be read if you have read the first novel in this series. If I were you, I would order both books 2 and 3 of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" (asuuming that you've read book 1) because when you are done with this book you are going to want to dive right into book 3. This book is a new type of fantasy novel and should not be missed by any fan of the genre. This book will do everything BUT disappoint.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-05-10

This is very visual and this gives nice, computerized anatomical charts. These charts are some of the most creative and beautiful charts that have been published. All of the charts that are in this book are three dimensional and they give you a feel as to what it is like if you could look at many different angles of each organ. To go along with the charts are informative essays on the functions of each organ or system that is in the book and there is important vocabulary highlighted in these essays. There is also a list of each minor part of the organ so you can find each part of the organ that you are looking at. This anatomical reference was put together by the Visible Human Project, a big project that had goals of doing what was presented in this book, three dimensional, computerized anatomy charts. This is a very nice medical book to add to any collection but this will not substitute big anatomy atlasses such as Gray's Anatomy. This is a very nice reference and keep-sake.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-05-08

This is the story of Jacob Gutgeld and how he left the ghetto for the Jews in Poland and went to stay with a non-Jewish family. This novel will make you appreciate the goodness within most people and you will examine yourself and see whether or not you are similar to the Roslan family, the family that took care of Jacob Gutgeld, and two of his brothers. <br /> This would be a good Holocaust novel for a child to read as it doesn't have very mature themes and this is age appropriate for a young person. This book will touch you deep within and the authors of this novel, which happens to be based on true events, will carefully show how a few families during World War II helped out Jewish people that went into hiding from the Nazi party. \\"Jacob's Rescue\\" is recommend to anybody that is looking for a good Holocaust novel. Keep in mind, though, that this would be better reading for a young child than for an adult. This is recommended very strongly.<br />Happy Reading!!!	2002-04-30

This is not only what is probably the best fantasy novel that I've ever read but one of the greatest novels in fiction. This is the first book in \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, a projected six book epic fantasy. This awesome fantasy has absolutely no quests and the plot doesn't center around magic. If that's the case, why is it a fantasy novel? Aren't fantasy novels supposed to center around quests and magic? The answer for the latter is the that that was true until George R.R. Martin came around.<br /> George R.R. Martin is an author of many books, a lot which are unfortunately out of print. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is, as said above, unlike any normal fantasy novel. It centers around politics and war these two components to this extoadinary novel make for tons and tons of suspense. The plot of his fantasy novel is awesome. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros has many big houses, or families, and man are rivals against the Lannisters. After an opening of some strange events, the Lannisters are on the brink of war mainly with the Tullys and the Starks (probably the msot loved house). Across the sea Viserys Targaryen, a direct descendant from Aerys, who lost his throne to Robert Baratheon, has his sister Daenerys wed Khal Drogo so he can get an army and win back the throne for himself. Oh, and may I add that these events only take place in oh, the first 100- 150 pages!? Never have I read a novel that has made keep flipping and flipping pages non-stop.<br /> Martin's characters are so believable and you can relate to them so well. It is easy to love the wonderful characters and to loathe the bad ones. Martin has a tendency to make characters reveal the true side to themselves, which makes this novel even more riveting. My favorite character is Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son Jon Snow. I relate to Jon so much and relations with characters like these makes this novel seem very real.<br /> George R.R. Martin has a gift to write beautifully and to tell awesome stories. His writing skill will make you turn pages in addition to the plot. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a fantasy novel that is like no other. I centers on things that make this novl more enjoyable than the regular \\"sword and sorcery\\" type fantasy. I recommend this novel to a fantasy fan that is looking for a great new voice in the genre. This is absolutely recommeded.<br />Happy Reading!br /> George R.R.

This story doesn't take place in a concentration camp like other books. This is the story of Friedrich Schneider and his family during the Holocaust. It takes place over about 15 years or so and accurately represents what went on to Jewish families and people in Europe (Germany in this book) during World War II. This is a very touching novel.<br /> \\"Friedrich\\" is written in the first person and Friedrich's friend (his name is not revealed) is the narrator. Because of this type of narraration you are not totally seeing the Jewish side of the story, which makes this novel very interesting. All of the discrimination that is shown against Jews in this book is very sad but is historically accurate. In the back of the book is a timeline that has a detailed account of the major events pertaining to the Holocaust during World War II so you can make references while reading the book. <br /> This is a book that will grab you from the start and will draw you in as you will care deeply for each of the characters in this novel. This is a Holocaust book that I will remember due to a very touching, thought out story and interesting characters. this book will be appreciated by anybody that is interested in the Holocaust that took place during World War II. I recommend this book very highly.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-04-23

In addition to the final artowrk there are also concept drafts from \\"scribble\\" stages, to a general rough draft, all the way to the ginal, full color, and eye-catching pictures.

If you have read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy already, most of the information in this book will be known to you. This is still fun to read, nonetheless.

Tolkien from A to Z. This is the first book of this kind that I have read from cover to cover an I found this work to be thouroughly enjoyable. Brian Sibley, the author of this great guide, did a great job of finding and researching all of this information and did an even greater job by writing it all up in fun, easy to read articles next to gorgeous photographs. <br /> The articles presented in this work cover everything from a biography of Peter Jackson, the director of the trilogy, and how he was inspired as a young boy to one day be a moviemaker. There is also a biography of J.R.R. Tolkien. The book then delves into information about the sets chosen for these films and why and how New Zealand was such a great choice to do the filming of the pictures at. Then there are biographies of each actor that had a main part in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; motion picture trilogy. Then we learn about costumes, make-up, prosthetics, swords, props, and many more things that made up his film. Within all of this information there are great quotes from the actors that were received from interviews by Brian Sibley. The photographs in this book are gorgeous and Brian Sibley was also able to get some original drawings of Middle Earth from artists like John Howe and Alan Lee put into the book.<br /> &quot;The Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide&quot; is great for a lover of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movies or books. With great writing and pictures this is fun to look at and read. This book can be read very quickly and easily while being enjoyed. All in all, this is a great book that a fan of the movie or books would enjoy. Purchase this book and you'll experience the motion picture trilogy that you have seen and loved.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-04-04

Harry Potter has grown from one book to what is now four of some of the most popular fiction books on the planet. There will be a total of seven books in this wonderful series and this is the way to buy the series if you are just getting started. If I were you I wouldn't even bother with the paperback versions as you will re-read these books over the years time and time again.<br /> J.K. Rowling, the acclaimed author of this fabulous series, had no clue that Harry Potter would become what it would be. She started to write the first words of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\\" on a napkin while having coffee. She wanted to publish a book so she could support herself and her daughter, who were living in deplorable conditions. Because of the fame of these novels that she has written she is one of the wealthiest people on the planet! Now on to the books!<br /> \\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\\" is the first book in the projected seven book series. It is here that we learn a little of Harry's history, meet the magical world, are introduced to students and teachers at Hogwarts, and a plethora of other things that will be essential to know later on in the series.<br /> \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" continues the story of Harry Potter. This book, in my opinion, is tied with \\"Goblet of Fire\\" for the best in the series because of the awesome suspense and and plot twists. \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is where we are introduced to Sirius Black, who is a critical person in the series. And finally \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\\" which I think is the second best of the series, is the most dramatic and is much darker than the previous books of the series. Lord Voldemort is regaining his power in this novel and his whole dark alliance is stirring once again. This book, as stated above, is what I'd say is the best of the series along with the second book.<br /> The hardcover editions that come in this set (the only Harry Potter hardcover books) are absolutely gorgeous. Mary Grandpre who illustrated each book cover is very talented and her work is great.<br />The Harry Potter is the best young adult fantasy series that is out there today and is definitely worth checking out. There are still three more books that have to be written and if you read these books you will be in suspense like every other Harry Potter fan. This series is recommended and will be loved by all.

At the conclusion of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; you are left in suspense and you are craving what's to come next. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; will get you over your suspense a little, but at the end of this second installment of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; you'll be left in more suspense that you were at the conclusion of &quot;Fellowship.&quot;<br /> The first half of this book centers on Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn as they come about a big point in the book that will leave you feeling very happy. Don't worry, I won't tell you what that thing is. The Fellowship still remains split up and some things that you wanted to know at the conclusion of the last book are revealed, as said above. That is as much as I'll tell you for this book because if I tell you anymore the book will be ruined for you.<br /> As in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien gives you luscious descriptions and phenomonal writing. He goes into some matters that were brought forth in the first book with such skill that only Tolkien could pull off. At the end of this book you will feel a craving to pick up &quot;The Return of the King&quot; right away.<br /> &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the second book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the best of the first two volumes. Tolkien brings you into his beautiful world that you won't be able to get enough of. Before delving into this, be sure to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first so you won't feel like you're reading material that makes no sense to you. I recommend this book to a fantasy fan or somebody that is looking for an adventurous, grand fantasy epic. Be sure to read this novel.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-03-22

Thus is the story of Daisy,a Jewish woman living in Atlanta. Her son, Boolie, hires a chauffer to drive her around the city. Hoke, an african american man that Daisy wants to have no relation with, gets the job. <br /> Opening up in the 1950's and running all the way to 1975, this story tells of the growing friendship between Daisy and Hoke. For the first few years Daisy is embarassed to being driven around by a black man but they soon develop a lasting friendship that will last forever. <br /> \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" tells one thing. It tells about changes in people. Daisy was a Jewish women who wanted absolutely no part with Hoke. Throughout the play Alfred Uhry is able to develop on each character from Daisy and Hoke, to the maid Idella, to Daisy's son Boolie, to Boolie's wife, and everybody else that appears. This is a very short play and Alfred Uhry had to have some skill to pull off the awesome character development in this. <br /> \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" is a story of change in people and of true friendship. This play went on Broadway and became a movie. This play won the Pulitzer Prize in Drama and four Academy Awards for the movie. I recommend this play to anybody that would enjoy a touching story of two people that were everything but friends at first who became best friends for life. Pick this play up and you will appreciate this story and the friendship that is depicted in it.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-03-20

From the first pages when Bilbo Baggins makes his secret departure from Hobbiton, you are drawn in to this lush story. Tolkien tells a wonderful story and is able to do that while keeping the reader hooked from page 1.<br /> &quot;Fellowship&quot; is the start of the trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; In this first installment, Bilbo Baggins leaves Hobbiton and leaves The One Ring in the hands of his cousin, Frodo Baggins. When gandalf the Grey tells of brewing trouble the Hobbit says he's going to move to Buckland. He departs on a quest that will change his life forever. He takes along friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The hobbits finally reach Rivendell and an important counsel is held. This is the point in the book where the plot starts to skyrocket. To tell you any more on the plot would most likely ruin your reading.<br /> Tolkien's detail on nature and history is astounding and only makes the novel even greater. He is always describing the surroundings and I just couldn't get enough of it. Some may not like this detail because they say Tolkien just drags on and on. This couldn't be furthur from the truth. His detail only adds to this beautiful story.<br /> For those of you that are interested in reading this book because you loved the movie need to know what you are getting into. This is the start of one of the biggest and best fantasy epics of all time. Don't think that you're going to be opening a book that anybody can handle. That is not the case. Only people that are willing to make a commitment to a fabulous and sometimes complicated novel should buy this.<br /> &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is most likely the best fantasy epic of our time. There is not enough that one could say about such a riveting novel. I strongly recommend this to anyone that is interested in a wonderful fantasy that is willing to make a commitment.

Being the first in a series of over 25 books, I'm sure that this is probably not one of the best.<br /> For one thing, his humor wasn't the greatest. He threw in some dumb punchlines but the really good humor wasn't as easy to find. Things such as his &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory were pretty good compared to some other dry stuff. Despite this Pratchett still did a good job in presenting a comical fantasy adventure.<br /> The plot of this novel is pretty simple. Rincewind the Wizard (who graduated from Unseen University knowing no spells because one of the 8 Great spells trapped itself inside of him) meets the tourist Twoflower in a tavern. Twoflower hires Rincewind as his tourguide so he could see Discworld. After Twoflower sets the city of Ankh-Morpork on fire, he and Rincewind make a run for Quirm. Read on to find out the rest.<br /> Pratchett's characters are the actual very funny part about the book. Rincewind is just...Rincewind; Twoflower has to see everything even if it means his existence on Discworld will be no more; the talking sword, Kring; Hrun the Barbarian who fights and has basically a dumb mind; and many other characters that we meet throughout thisnovel are just funny. <br /> What is interesting about this book is that Terry Pratchett takes issues that have arised on Earth and puts them onto Discworld. These things make the world of Discworld seem even more like the one you and I are on right this very second.<br /> In conclusion, &quot;The Color of Magic&quot; is a great read that a fantasy fan or somebody looking for a good book to enjoy. This novel is relatively short and can be read quickly. After reading this I am looking forward to reading more books about Terry Pratchett's Discworld. This is probably the best way to start out this series. Read this, you won't be disappointed.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-02-25

It covers all parts of the body, diseases, treatment for diseases, and history related to each part of the body.<br />  This book covers every area of the human body from the nervous system, to the circulatory, to the vascular, lymphatic, and so on. It breaks down each function of every organ and system, and then goes furthur by stating which part os the organ does which. For example, it says that the heart pumps blood to the body. To go furthur, it may say that the aorta is the main artery which does that task. And so on.<br />   The book also lists diseases for each part of the body and some treatments that are available for them. This book is great when it comes to pictures. It has color pictures, black and white, and tons of words with lines pointing to show where each part of an organ is.

Along the way we run into goblins, elves, giant spiders and much more intrigue.<br />  I recommend this novel to any lover of fantasy or books in general.

When they get to the village, they have hopes that the mystery of V.F.D. will be solved. Unfortunately, the village and the mystery are not the same. Fortunately, though, the Quagmire triplets are somewhere in the village. The treacherous villain Olaf returns too, but this time doesn't play as big a role as in other books. So, &quot;The Vile Village&quot; is definitely one of the best of the series, and I can't wait to read the six remaing volumes to come.

James Patterson's novel could have been cut in half, had way more twists, and a much better ending. A thing that I did enjoy about this book was all of the medical and hospital surroundings. The investigation was also great too.<br /> There are two serial killers working on each side of the United States. After Alex Cross' niece, Naomi is kidnapped, he puts himself on the case. Alex Cross is a great character, and I don't think that the book would be any good if it were not for him. Kate McTiernan is also a great character. Patterson is a great writer that puts the words in your mind, but unfortunately his story was not the greatest. But don't get me wrong, it was good.<br /> The book is not like some of Patterson's others; it doesn't have lots of FBI related material, is low on forensic science, and just that other type of investigatorial stuff. But this book does include some medicine, and I liked that. Patterson also gives a reliable description of Beverley Hills and areas around Duke University in North Carolina. His description was not lacking, but it was not great like some of his others like &quot;Roses are Red.&quot;<br /> Now you must be asking why I gave this novel just three stars. I did so because the novel was very predictable, lacked much action, and had a disappointing and predictable ending. Besides these points, &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; is a novel you don't want to miss. If you're looking for a non-stop action thriller, then look elsewhere in the genre or the Alex Cross series. So, don't dig into this novel thinking it's bad; because that's not what you'll get. So, overall I give &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; a &quot;C.&quot; This novel is not bad, but not great. Good luck and enjoy!<br />Happy Reading	2001-04-27

Dr. Abby DiMatteo, a second year resident at Bayside, is starting to work with the transplant team, and they seem a little weird. She uncovers some things, and learns more of the team's past history. Meanwhile, she is in love with a member of the team, Dr. Mark Hodell. When a needy boy needs a heart, Abby and another doctor think that this boy will get the heart. But it doesn't seem that way now. It appears that the team is doing some business behind the hospital's back, and are getting organs for people not in desperate need of them. This gets Abby thinking, and thus begins one of the best books I've read.<br /> &quot;Harvest,&quot; is first rate suspense.

The first three hundred pages of &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; were very enjoyable for the most part, but after that the book just went downhill. Brooks started the book of very good, and the following quest was done very well, but when they reached the castle everything seemed to drag on and on. <br /> I say Brooks has potential because he does write well and grips the reader, but that formula seemed to wear off during the middle of the novel. He had some good magic ideas too. The elfstones weren't bad, but they seemed much too childish. The writing for the most part was very good though. <br /> The world that Brooks has created is not fascinating, but kind of enjoyable. He does lack on a lot of description, and that can keep people from enjoying the novel. I was not able to see the world in my head very clearly because of that.<br /> The things presented in the novel came mostly from Brooks' imagination, but the quest and all seemed much like Tolkien's style of writing and story. Maybe lack of originality was a reason why I didn't enjoy the book. And sometimes the story got very, very boring. I think that the main thing that happened with the story is that Brooks was not able to hold the reader in suspense as he did at the beginning.<br /> One of the only aspects of the novel that I enjoyed were the characters. I very much enjoyed seeing the usual fantasy creatures appear, as well as some new ones that Brooks created. I enjoyed the character of Alannon the Druid very much. Alannon was the most thought out and realistic of all the characters. One of the only original aspects of the story that I enjoyed were the tombs that they passed through. <br /> One thing that Brooks does include in the novel is character development. Every single character in the novel is built on and can be felt for. If someone was about to die I had my eyes closed in agony. This is one place where I did have feeling.  <br /> So, &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; is not one of the best fantasy novels around, but then some may disagree and enjoy it. Maybe it was my tastes that kept me from enjoying it? Who knows? But the one thing that fantasy fans will most likely agree on is the lack of originality. If you like books that are like a rehash of Tolkien works, then you are bound to enjoy this. If you're looking for something new and original, keep away from this. So, good luck.	2001-04-05

In this book, they focus on the Europe and Russia.<br /> The book is broken down into chapters on the physical geography of Europe and Russia, the extensive history of each, dating back to the early Romans and Greeks, and units on the cultures of the two. My favorite chapter is the history chapter, as it explores ancient Romans and Greeks, and goes into some mythology. <br /> This book also has great photos and portraits to go along with the fact being presented in the text. The pages are not cluttered with any non-sense; it just gives the most important facts and moves on. <br /> The book also expands much on the cultures of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia. The culture chapters include information on each country, with ethnicites, religions, food, and lifestyles. <br /> This is the book that I used in class for a few months, and it's very easy to comprehend with and is to study from. Each chapter is broken down into anywhere from 3 to 5 sections, each section having a short review with a few questions. At the conclusion of each chapter there are Critical Thinking questions, a vocabulary segment, a review of the main ideas presented in the chapter, a map activity, among many other things.<br /> The Europe and Russia book apart of the World Explorer series, is a fun and easy way to learn the necessities that need to be known in the geography of these two places. I recommend the whole series for a fun, efficient way to learn geography. This is a must buy. And unlike other textbooks, this is very affordable. A must buy!<br />Happy Learning	2001-04-04

For example: If you wanted to say that John and Maria eat, you'd use the ellos from, meaning more than one person. The verb, being to eat, in Spanish is comer. You'd make comer make sense with its subjects, John and Maria. You drop the 'er' from comer and add'en,' making comen. So, the sentence would be, John y Maria comen. It's very simple with practice. That's the main focus with the book. I'm glad to say I'm moving to an intermediate course next year, and I hope I'll be speaking Spanish even better. This is a great beginners book, and I hope you decide to buy it. Have fun learning!<br />Adios, amigos!	2001-03-30

The novel is the story to destroy The Black Crochan, the cauldron that Arawn uses to make the Cauldron- Born. <br /> There is also a lot of character development in this book. We see how much Taran, Eilonwy, and Fflewddur have matured since the last book, and we see new characters grow from what they were in the beginning of the book. For example, Ellidyr grows tremendously from the first few pages to the last. <br /> Lloyd Alexander also made this book much darker than its predecessor. He kills more and you never will know who's really evil and who's really good. <br /> We also travel much more to the other parts of the land of Prydain. We meet new rivers, The Marshes of Morva, and more villages. We also go near Annuvin, the home of Arawn and his army of Huntsmen, Cauldron- Born, and gwythaints. <br /> So, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was a fabulous book indeed. We see more action, darkness, character growth, and other things among the novel. For me, the most enjoyable part of the story was the character development. This book may seem a wee bit slow at times, but just keep going. You may enjoy this book more if you have read &quot;The Book of Three,&quot; but you can still enjoy it on its own. I can't wait to read the rest of the &quot;Chronicles of Prydain.&quot;<br />Happy Reading!	2001-03-29

It's not that &quot;Castaways of the Flying Dutchman&quot; was bad, it just wasn't my taste. I enjoyed the beginning of the book because there was some action aboard the ship, but after that the novel started to slow down a bit. Although it's good that Jacques took a break from &quot;Redwall,&quot; &quot;Castaways&quot; was lacking on a lot of fantasy elements. While Jacques had some good ideas, I think he could've done much better. The one thing that earned this book three stars is Jacques' writing talent. The characters are pretty good and thought out though. So, read this if you like a novel with light fantasy and not very fast pacing. It's not that the bok was a screwup, I think it was just my personal tastes that through me off. So, if you end up not liking this, &quot;Redwall&quot; is great.<br />Good Luck	2001-03-28

Lloyd Alexander's &quot;The Book of Three&quot; is an absolutely fabulous fantasy novel. It has a wonderful cast of characters, despicable villains, dwarves, and other fantasy creatures. One thing that makes this book so good is the way you can feel for the characters. This novel also has a load of adventure and battles. <br /> The novel revolves around Taran, an &quot;Assistant Pig-Keeper&quot; in the village of Caer Dallben. After an oracullar pig named Hen-Wen escapes, he is involved in an adventure to find the pig and deliver a message to The House of Don that The Horned King is in his way there. <br /> But all of this is stalled after another turn of events, which has Taran held prisoner in a palace. Throughout the adventure Taran meets wonderful supporting characters like Eilonwy, Fflewddur, Doli, Medwyn and tons of other people.<br /> The world that Alexander has created is fabulous in itself. With tons of villages and palaces, cultures and groups, you can never become bored with the land of Prydain. <br /> One reason I think I enjoyed this novel so much is because of the adventure and action. Alexander does a fabulous job here, and any reader will become spellbound with the way he hooks you with this.<br /> With all of this in the book, Alexander keeps the reader in suspense turning pages a mile a minute. He is able to weave everything together to make a most enjoyable read. Not to mention the amazing ending...<br /> Some of the things presented in this novel are amazing too. Like the way Medwyn has a special ability to communicate with animals and they know they're safe with him. Hen-Wen's abilities are really cool too. <br /> Being a novice to fantasy and wanting to read more epic stuff like Martin, Jordan, Hobb, etc., this was a great novel to really get me hooked. If you are starting with fantasy, then this is the perfect place to start.<br /> I have not read a novel this good in a while, and hope the other entries in the series are just as good. I reccomend this novel to young children and adults alike. Anybody will be able to comprehend the novel and will be held in suspense. <br /> &quot;The Book of Three&quot; is nonstop adventure from cover to cover. Lloyd Alexander takes some  Welsh lore and mixes that in with his own outstanding ideas, and that equals a brilliant story. I definitely enjoyed this novel and am looking forward to reading the rest of &quot;The Prydain Chronicles.&quot; This is a definite must read.<br />Happy Reading!	2001-03-25

It is funny, presents Holocaust facts through what appears to be fiction, and is just a good read. This is the story of Ephraim and his many stories at his concentration camps. Since the Holocaust stiil exists in his mind, he suffers from some insomnia. He's always talking, &quot;The camp this, the camp that.&quot; While the story mainly involves around Ephraim, it also involves much around his daughter and two sons, Max and Simon.

The novel is about Grange, Florida, women JoLayne Lucks, and how she wins the lottery, loses her ticket, and then gets it back. Carl Hiaasen has a truly twisted and funny mind, and &quot;Lucky You&quot; shows it. He brings in a cast of pshycopaths, Christian Pilgrims, crazy people, and just normal people. That combined with an original, imaginative plot, gives you a very funny read. This wasn't the funniest novel that I've ever read, but certainly a good one.

Late one night a huge giant by the name of Hagrid shows up and he takes Harry and explains that Harry is a wizard and a famous one too.

I was first exposed to this book in school where people were telling me that the books were great and I had to read this one. So I read all three and finally got to this one. This book was great! This book starts of with a creepy chapter that I think could have been made a prologue instead of a chapter, whatever. The book then turns right back to the normal where Harry is found at the Dursley's house. He goes with Ron and Hermione to the Quiiditch World Cup where he meets VERY impotrant people. He is then shipped off to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express where he unfortunatly meets the horrible Draco Malfoy. When he gets to school there is news that Quidditch season is canceled and the Triwizard tournament will be hel. I think I'll stop here and not give away the plot. Please read this book and don't be intimidated by the size of it. You'll love this book. Happy Reading!	2000-10-28

It has horrible characters, a dumb story, and does not hold your interest. It was so bad I never even bothered to finish it. This book was bad! For a good read read It, The Stand, or The Shining.	2000-10-25

After the horrible Danse Macabre I never would have thought that King would make another attempt at non-fiction. In this attempt he strikes well and this book was great! The book basically has two parts, the first an autiobiography, and the second a writing guide which really helped me. <br /> The first part of the book I feel was put in as a sort of inspiration. I must say his life was truly weird and also very cool. From the days when he was a tot to the days when he got married this section houses all of that wondeful information.<br /> The second part, the writing guide, is truly great as it teaches things you would never learn in school. It shows how to draft your books, how to choose a topic, and how to use the right words and grammar. I feel this part of the book must be read even if you are not an author or writer. <br /> Lastly Mr. King throws in a brief summary of the events that happened in the summer of 1999. So this book is not to be missed for any King fan. If you are not a fan don't waste your time and money.	2000-10-24

It is about a dog named Cujo that becomes rabid and attacks the town of Castle Rock. He traps a mother and son in the mother's Pinto for days. With a great plot and storyline this book is really great and any King fan would love it. The only thing about the book that I did not like is the characters. What was really cool about this book is that you actually get to read Cujo's point of view on everything. In conclusin, read this book for a great read but don't except a whole lot of horror in this little book. Happy Reading!	2000-10-24

The only thing that really bothered me with this book is the lack of dialogue and writing that would hold the reader throughout the whole book.<br /> The book is about young Trisha McFarland that gets lost in the woods fromher mother and brother. Bascially the book is a story of self survival and she does this by imagining that Tom Gordon, the relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is with her. Using this and her radio, she finds the strength inside of her to go on. She finally makes it and has a final showdown with the &quot;thing&quot; that was scaring her.<br /> Although not horrible I wouldn't recommend it over any other King book.	2000-10-24
