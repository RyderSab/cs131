The plot is unexceptional and the characters, while interesting enough by any other author's standards, fall short of expectation for an Elmore Leonard novel.  There's no suspense in the story at all, and that's probably the biggest disappointment.  <br />The Amazon.com review notes that the budding romance between the witness and the detective characters removes any element of suspense that could have attached to her character, and the same holds true for the contents of the safe deposit box, which is the McGuffin of the book.  There was a chance to blow the reader away with the reveal of the McGuffin, but ultimately, it ended up being just what everyone thought it was going to be.<br />The dialogue is typically tight and hard boiled.  Leonard is a master at capturing the feeling of authenticity by writing the dialogue of lowlifes and cops just right.  Unfortunately, that's probably the only highlight to the book.	2004-04-05

The book is deceptively simple in the tale it has to tell, but effectively still underscores a powerful yearning to return to a simpler time in his life.  Teenagers feeling overburdened with their lives will gain a lot from reading this book, as will the parents who love them.	2004-04-04

Lovers of Wolfe's other works will not be disappointed.  He's captured the best and worst elements of New York City and all of its excesses, and wove it into a powerful tale.	2004-04-04
US	51900550	R2BC0AVI8FC6QF	0743238087	191061509	Havana: An Earl Swagger Novel	Books	4	0	1	N	N	My first Swagger novel; a great ride	This was my first experience with Stephen Hunter's fiction writing and with Earl Swagger, and I didn't come away disappointed.  Hunter has created a simple, but loveable character in Earl Swagger who -- in his simplicity -- is probably everything that young men aspire to become:  A hero.  Hunter does a great job of creating a hard-boiled good guy who isn't ham-fisted or cliched.  An admirable task.<br />More than that, Hunter has carefully and successfully walked the tightrope of writing a fictional story using a historical character as an integral figure in the plot.  When a lesser author attempts this task, the effort often comes across as forced and incredible, forcing the reader further outside of the imaginary world that's been crafted.  Here, however, Hunter's use of Fidel Castro blends perfectly with the story at hand and lends a true depth to the plot.  <br />Prehaps the only shortcoming of this book is that the plot elements are entirely predictable and ordinary.  That is not to say that the story itself isn't wonderfully entertaining, only that there wasn't an element to the story that threw me for a loop or kept me on the edge of my seat.  In a way, that's perhaps appropriate for a story starring a character that's a wonderfully straightforward as Earl Swagger.  The rich characterization makes up for any shortcomings in originality of plot.	2004-02-04

The character, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, is still wholly sympathetic and likable, and &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; tells the tale of how he came to find happiness.<br />Much like many of Martin's movies, the book is warmly human and ends on a touching and sentimental note.  On the way, Martin does a good job of taking the reader through Cambridge's neuroses and showing how he manages to climb out of the morass that he's fallen into.  <br />As a matter of craft, Martin is skilled in creating sympathetic and layered characters who compel the reader to learn more about them.  However, Martin gives in to a tendency to use too many adjectives and awkward vocabulary, apparently only to make his writing more lyrical.  This is not a fatal weakness of the book, but it becomes distracting at times.<br />All in all, this is a quick and pleasant read.	2003-12-06

She does a good job of painting a picture for the reader, showing what it was like to live inside her head during her most depressed states.  The honesty with which she bares her disease for all to see is remarkable and brave.  What sometimes puts the reader off a bit is her tendency for self-indulgence and self-absorption.  <br />True, this is a book about herself, but at the same time, there isn't any allowance for an opposing point of view at key moments in her suffering.  For most of the book, Wurtzel's mother is seen as nothing more than whiny and weak, and that simply can't be true of a woman who raised a Harvard-educated child on her own.  We're never given more than a glimpse at Wurtzel's friends, either, who clearly played a large role in her recovery from depression, especially when she enrolls in Harvard and is away from her mother.<br />Nevertheless, this is a powerful tale of a disease that many Americans still don't fully understand.  The Epilogue is perhaps the most important part of this book, as it details the increasing diagnosis of depression in our society, and highlights why books like Prozac Nation are becoming more and more important.	2003-12-05

For the first 100 pages of the novel, I found myself wondering what the fuss was about.  It was the latter 230 pages or so that opened my eyes to the greatness of this book.  It's clearly one of the best, most intelligently-written, thoughtful books I've read this year.  <br />Pi's struggle for survival in the open sea is a story that I thought would be a struggle to make interesting for an extended period of time, but Martel really makes the story work.  Every hardship endured by Pi is felt profoundly by the reader.  Every struggle Pi goes through so thoroughly enraptures the reader that the ending is a complete, although logical and pleasant, surprise.<br />Martel does a wonderful job of giving the reader their choice of alternative endings.  The remarkable thing about this is how effortless he makes it appear.  This is a powerful story of the strength of the human spirit and what a person can do to survive.	2003-12-05

His writings are at once funny and poignant.  To be able to touch and move readers in the way that Sedaris does is truly a gift, and one that should be treasured while he's still around treating society to more of his wonderful work.<br />&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is at least as funny as &quot;Naked&quot;, and some of Sedaris's stories about living as an ignorant American in France were truly unforgettable.

Those criticisms go a bit overboard, in my book.  First and foremost, this book is an intelligently written thriller, one that will constantly have the reader on turning the page waiting to see what happens next.  Dan Brown has written an ingenious series of codes that help the mystery unravel in a captivating manner.  This isn't a garden-variety whodunnit and it was never meant to be.  Rather, it's one of the few intelligent thrillers out in the market today.<br />In fact, this book has sparked an interest to learn more about art, architecture and history on my part.  Brown does a fantastic job of making each of these elements come alive in his story.  It's impossible to come away from this book without a greater appreciation for the artworks that inspired it.<br />All in all, this is a highly recommended book.  There are parts towards the end that make the final twist rather predictable, but they weren't so transparent as to make the story unenjoyable.  Solving the riddles is the true joy of this book.	2003-10-20

The fall from grace that he experienced would have completely and utterly destroyed a weaker man.  To be so high and to fall so low is truly not to be underestimated.  Blackburn is to be commended for sharing as much of his personal story as he did.<br />The honesty with which he deals with his depression are perhaps the most compelling parts of this book.  It's rare that a reader is granted access to the inside of a depressed mind.  Blackburn does a decent job of showing the reader what his state of mind was like at the time.<br />All in all, however, the book suffers from Blackburn's storytelling skills.  The book reads rather much like it was directly transcribed from dictation.  There is very little art in Blackburn's writing.<br />Nevertheless, I'd recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from work-related depression.  It's truly a unique and useful read in that regard.	2003-10-20

Martinez is an engaging writer, one who is informative and humorously entertaining at the same time.  <br />My only problem with this book is that for a book on Las Vegas, there really didn't seem to be too many chances taken by the author.  What gripped me about the book was the excerpt in the back describing how the author had just lost over $20,000, and fretting at how he was going to tell his wife and his publisher.  In the end, that was the most gripping tale in the book as far as gambling went.  Martinez ultimately left Vegas only down about 10% from what he brought with him.  It seemed like an unsatisfying trip, one where he never really got off the pot, so to speak.  Ultimately, the closing sequence where much of his losses occur seem almost to be a frantic attempt to lose his nest egg to at least close out his book with a floiurish.  It feels rushed and forced and didn't really do the trick.<br />However, gambling aside, the book is still entertaining and informative.  Much is shared about the people living in Vegas, the history of the town, and the development of the casino culture.  Those are the true strengths of the book.	2003-09-24

He has boldly (and some would say presumptuously) fictionalized the accounts of the man who famously held up a column of People's Army tanks by merely standing in front of them, and that of Deng Xiaopeng.  Both of these stories would be difficult to tell in the hands of a lesser writer, but Cheng pulls it off admirably.  <br />The novel isn't so much about the Tiananmen uprising as it is about how the uprising affected the main characters.  That said, perhaps the most important scene in the book (holding up the column of tanks) comes too soon in the narrative.  After reading that dramatic sequence, everything else that follows falls flat.  It's no coincidence that Cheng's narrative loses steam in the beginning of the second half of the book.  <br />That said, &quot;Sons of Heaven&quot; is an important work and an impressive debut novel.	2003-08-11

The book has all the makings of a fine children's book in the vein of \\"Harry Potter\\", but Chabon probably should have altered his writing style to make the book accessible for younger readers.  Neil Gaiman did so in his children's book \\"Coraline\\" to great effect.  That is perhaps the book's greatest failing.<br />Other than that, the book is a wonderful adventure filled with colorful characters and self-discovery.  If anything, too much occurs in the book, and I found myself anxiously waiting for Chabon to take me to the climax of the story.  Regardless, it wasn't a difficult wait.  Older readers (15+) of the Harry Potter series should enjoy this book.	2003-08-11

The mystery surrounds Lawrence Miller and his connections to the disappearance of several women to whom he finds himself connected throughout the novel.  To say that this is what the book is about would be to shortchange Lasdun's efforts here.  The greater theme underlying the book is ambiguity and perception.  <br />All in all, if you're looking for a satisfying whodunnit where the villain unveils his scheme in the penultimate scene, then move right along.

All at once poignant, touching and screamingly funny, David Sedaris has done a wonderful job of creating a memoir that's worth reading.

Perhaps the changing times and a different society that exists today as compared to 1986 play a part in forming my opinion.  There was nothing in the book that truly captured my imagination, nor did I find the book to be a particularly shocking portrayal of American society.  <br />The literary narrative didn't grab me, either.  I found the writing to be dry and unspirited.  Ellis's efforts in &quot;American Psycho&quot; were far superior.<br />Perhaps I'm judging this book harshly and unfairly.  After all, it was Ellis's first novel and it was published nearly 20 years ago.  Still, it didn't entertain me, nor did it cause me to think particularly.  Overall, I was disappointed.	2003-05-23

In places, Passaro just ends up doing the equivalent of written babbling.  It's unfortunate, as the book holds some promise and some of the characters are very interesting and three dimensional.  And yet, those characters are never given a chance to shine and there isn't any plot to speak of.  I hesitate to give this novel a 1 star if only for the promise that is shown, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	2003-05-04

It's a powerful and tragic story.  What is all the more impressive about this tale is what's left unsaid by both the characters and the author, and yet, these omissions make the story all that much more compelling.  <br />Ha Jin completely drew me into the world of his characters, and more importantly, into his characters minds and hearts.  Both of his leads, Lin Kong and Manna Wu, are perhaps not very likeable characters by virtue of their many, many flaws, and yet Ha Jin makes you care about them all the same.  <br />This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.	2003-04-17

It's a great book about a man encountering a mid-life crisis and an attempt to find meaning in his life.

From what I understand, this is her maternal grandmother's life story, and Fleischman relates it very well.  The story is compelling and the characters are captivating.  If anything, the greatest weakness of the story may be that of all the characters, the main character is the least interesting of all.

In spite of the harrowing nature of the crime -- which is sprung on the reader in the opening pages of the novel -- there is little that is sensational or distastefully done in this book.  Perhaps owing to Sebold's own experiences as a victim of violent crime, The Lovely Bones is a touching and heart wretching depiction of a marriage and family that is trying to mend itself back together after their daughter is murdered.  As a parent, certain portions of the narrative are absoultely painful.  And yet, the book is wonderful and uplifting in terms of how it shows a family coming back together and healing.<br />Still, this book is not for me.  There were many points in which I felt the descriptions were far too verbose and at times, unnecessary to advance the story.  I tend to be a more literal individual, and prefer my fiction to have similar tendencies.  While this book's literary merit can't be denied, it's not for everyone.	2003-01-13

Gus and Call are two of the most well-textured and crafter characters I've had the pleasure to come across in popular fiction.  It's tremendously rewarding when a book this popular is also so highly rewarding as a piece of literature.  <br />This was one of those books that made me long to experience all the things the main characters were going through as I was reading about them.  I began consuming bacon, biscuits and buttermilk as I was reading this book, but I haven't really ate any of that since then.  McMurtry will being you in completely into the world of Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call and although it's a long journey, when it's all over, you won't want to leave.  I knew the book was going to be rewarding when I noticed I was reading page 300 and felt like I had just started the book.  Time flies.<br />In its simplest terms, this is a book about a cattle drive from south Texas to Montana.  On closer examination, the book examines themes of love, loyalty, duty and courage.  One of the most amazing books I've ever read.	2002-12-06

I don't doubt that this book reflects real-life individuals and situations.  What I wonder is whether it could have been done in a less unilateral fashion, and more fairly.<br />I didn't find the main character, Nanny, to be particularly sympathetic.  In fact, she seemed to me to be exactly the same as everyone else in the book.  She was just as materialistic and selfish as the rest.  The only thing that set her apart was her love for the child, Grayer, but even that relationship was never provided any real depth.  You never knew why Nanny cared for him, only that she did because she was his caretaker, he was an innocent child, and his parents didn't seem to love him.  I don't know that that's enough on which to base a major relationship in the book.<br />Also, there was Nanny's relationship with H.H., or &quot;Harvard Hottie&quot; (really, that's what those initials are supposed to stand for).  There's never any exploration of why she's attracted to H.H., aside from the fact that, well, he's a hottie that goes to Harvard.  And there's never any exploration of the converse, except for the fact that Nanny is kind of hot, too, I guess.  From the start, H.H. completely kow-tows to Nanny and there never appears to be any real reason why.  As the relationship progresses, you'll find yourself wondering why she cares so much for this guy, because it doesn't appear as if they know each other too well.<br />All in all, this book is a quick and easy read, but ultimately disappointing.  There's no texture nor depth to the story and panders to the audience's pre-conceptions of the privileged and rich without lending any extra dimensions to the caricatures portrayed.	2002-10-17

The pure power of morality and love coupled with the intensity of the violence in these pages make this book unforgettable.  The art meshes perfectly with the writing.  In fact, if I had to pick Max Allan Collins or Richard Piers Rayner as the star of the book, I'd have to go with Rayner.  Some of the detail in his panels are simply mind numbing.  Collins has crafted a great father-son/assassin tale along the lines of the Japanese comic Lone Wolf and Cub, but Rayner's work is what really puts Perdition over the top as a graphic novel.<br />This book is a touching if disturbing look into a mob assassin's relationship with his older son, and his quest for vengence for the death of his wife and younger son.  A noir-ish tale deftly told as it weaves in conflicting notions of religious morality, loyalty, vengence, and proper guidance for a child.  A gripping tale.	2002-10-02

When the first story in this collection (&quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot;) was published, the industry and fandom was completely blown away.  Alan Moore took a throw-away character (the Swamp Thing) and a forgotten villain (Jason Woodrue, the Floronic Man) and founded an entire genre of comics that had been long forgotten (or at least neglected) since the 50s or so.<br />DC's Vertigo line, the Sandman series, and very likely, Watchmen all would have likely never happened without the series of comics reprinted here.  There is some truly frightening material in here that is unlike most comic fare aimed at younger readers (or at least sanitized for younger minds), but the writing was revolutionary for its time and holds up well today.  The artwork maintains the high standards of excellence Moore establishes.  The partnership of Alan Moore and Stephen Bissette is one of those magical pairings that occurs so infrequently in comic history (I compare it to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby on the Fantastic Four, Chris Claremont and John Byrne on X-Men, and Marv Wolfman and George Perez on Teen Titans).  This is truly a treasure to add to your collection.	2002-10-01

I'm a lifelong comic fan and take pride in keeping apprised of independent, critically acclaimed works (even if I don't read them all), and I was surprised when I never heard of Mail Order Bride. This book completely flew under many people's radars, I believe, and my opinion is that it would have sold much better with more attention.<br />The story and artwork are truly beautiful. Mark Kalesniko takes on a subject matter that is rife with stereotypes and cliches, and lends them depth and humanity. The story is moving, the individual panels are rich and emotion-invoking, and Kalesniko makes good use of the sequential panel structure to tell a story without words at many junctures. Most importantly, no character is two-dimensional. True, the premises surrounding each character are stereotypical, but Kalesniko eventually proves that he treasures his creations as individuals and not as plot devices.<br />Here, the reader is invited into the world of Monty Wheeler, a comic book store owner and lonely man, and Kyung Seo, his mail order bride from Korea. The reader accompanies them from their first meeting through their first awkward months together as husband and wife, observing as they initially try to do nothing but make the other happy. Slowly, their expectations of each other are not met and unhappiness and dissastisfaction results, because their expectations were artificially inflated by preconceived notions of each other.<br />Ultimately, the star of the book is Kyung, who comes into her own and discovers within herself a strong and independent woman, only to ultimately discover that this is not who she is. A tragic, if curious ending. <br />The only complaint I had about this book is that the author glosses over details that if included, would lend realism to his story, but inconvenience the plot. For example, Kyung speaks perfect English upon arrival in Canada. She chalks this up to always being good with languages. That's preposterous. Also, there's virtually no culture shock.  Although her character is one that is trying to leave her past behind, I don't think that anyone completely can do that without feeling some longing or regret for their home culture.  Especially in the case of an immigrant from East Asia to the U.S., the cultural differences are so vast, I don't see anyone adjusting as well as Kyung did.  I don't know that the author appreciates this.<br />However, these small details were easy to overlook because of the touching story and rich characterization.	2002-10-01

This is a first-rate and intimate look into the madness of a serial killer.  I don't think any other author can do that as well as Harris can.<br />Don't read this for a starring role by Hannibal Lecter.  Even in the movie the Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was really only in a handful of scenes.  His appearances here are even more limited.  He's still frightening and a genius, but those that read this book for the first story of Hannibal Lecter's madness will be disappointed.<br />Rather, the book focuses on Francis Dollarhyde/The Tooth Fairy/The Red Dragon.  At once intimidating, powerful, frightening and pathetic, Dollarhyde is an unforgettable character, and for my money, the star of the book.  The story really isn't so much about the hunt for a serial killer as it is about insanity and redemption and the failure of a man.  You'll find yourself more intimately drawn into Dollarhyde's world than will be comfortable.  You'll discover that you're completely absorbed into the wretchedness that is Dollarhyde's world and then shiver involuntarily in disgust.<br />Ultimately, Red Dragon is a fantastic read.  If you love thrillers, you won't be disappointed.	2002-09-30
US	51900550	R28K5R7XLFCDXN	0671024256	44310359	On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	A glimpse into Stephen King's mind	You don't necessarily get a glimpse into the bag of tricks King delves into to find ideas for his books, but you do gain insight into his thought process during the various stages of creation.  Many books on writing address the subject as dryly as a coroner would an autopsy, and to me, that's their greatest failure.  You can't craft a guidebook on a creative form of expression as if it were an instruction manual for a VCR.  <br />What King does here is different.  He provides a rough sketch of what the process of writing should be and leaves it to the reader (and hopefully, future writer) to fill in the details.  Writing after all, is a highly subjective and personal process.  King doesn't presume to dictate that there's only one way to do it.  <br />What he does convey, however, is that writing is a craft to be taken seriously, and as such, is to be considered a form of labor.  For him and ideally, for any aspiring writer, writing will be a labor of love, but King clearly imparts on the reader that a lot of sweat will and should go into crafting stories.<br />An added bonus to this book are the brief anecdotes King provides about his accident and his recovery that followed.  It's important to note that even for a writer as gifted and prolific as King, he never fell into the cliche of saying that writing saved his life or even speeded his recovery.  In fact, King mentions how difficult it was to create and write when just weeks prior, he had done so with very little effort.  It's important for aspiring writers to see the craft in an unromanticized light, and to see that it's hard for even the best of writers at times.  That, and that it's worthwhile to keep working at it.<br />For anyone curious at all about the writing process, this book is a delightful read.	2002-09-18

A book you'll never forget	After everything you've ever read or seen about the Holocaust, you still need to read this book.  It's an experience unlike any other, because it's the only comic book (as a lifelong fan, I can't call them graphic novels, which I feel is only a term used to generate mainstream acceptance) ever created to specifically focus in on this issue and tell the story of a Holocaust survivor.  And being a comic, Maus has advantages over just about every other medium of communication.  The text allows Spiegelman to go into greater depth with his subject than film or television could.  The pictures, and especially the sequential panel structure, allow Spiegelman to provide quick and dirty narratives at particular junctures, and allow the reader's imagination take care of the rest.<br />And make no mistake, Spiegelman doesn't shy away from details of suffering in the book.  Many such details are conveyed in matter-of-fact form, and somehow, that doesn't diminish their impact or the monstrous conditions the Jews lived in during the Holocaust.  I'll never forget the one panel showing Spiegelman's young parents, hiding from the Nazis and starving, chewing on a piece of wood because \\"it feels like real food.\\"  Incredible.<br />As an added treasure, Spiegelman often appears as a character in his own book and provides commentary on the book creation process and his relationship with his father.  Incredibly honest and poignant, Spiegelman has created an unforgettable treasure.<br />And if you're not going to read it for Vladek Spiegelman's moving story of survival and love for his wife, read it to find out that comics aren't just for kids anymore.	2002-09-11

Few authors are able to create such textured characters with as much feeling and depth as Boswell does here.  If anything, the only character that did not strike me as particularly real or original is Peter Kamenev, who is slightly stereotyped as the precocious, over-sexed, hyperbolic old man.  Nevertheless, Kamenev if extremely enjoyable as a character as well.<br />The only reason why people may not like this book is that there were no earth-shattering developments in the plot.  Nothing truly happened to resolve the lingering tension in the book.  But to me, that's precisely the point.  The richness of the characters is not drowned out by a schmaltzy plot device.  Every character is allowed to develop and reveal his faults at their own pace.  They develop organically.  <br />You know that you've found a satisfying read when your chief complaint is that the book is too short!	2002-09-01
US	51900550	R1FX0EH0NE5XJ	0060185147	737127896	Courting Trouble	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Not horrible, but nothing special	This was my first Lisa Scottoline book, but I have to say that I came away unimpressed.  As a thriller, the book barely entertained me.  There were a couple of moments of true suspense, but those were spoiled by many other moments where I found myself saying aloud, &quot;Oh, come on . . . .&quot;  <br />None of the characters resonate with me as being multi-dimensional.  The reader is introduced to lead character, Anne Murphy, with several pages of discussion of how beautiful this woman is.  And that's what Scottoline uses to define this woman.  Unrelenting beauty which serves to mask the fact that she was born with a cleft lip or some such nonesense like that which is ultimately supposed to really lend depth to this character.  Oh, come on.  This didn't work for me.  I thought a female author would be able to provide some true depth to her lead female character.  Instead she dwells needlessly on her beauty, and often indulges in deliberations on fashion.  I expected better.<br />I don't know if Bennie Rosato is presented with any more realism in Scottoline's other stories, but she's equally one-dimensional.  She's the screaming, ultra-demanding boss who really loves her employees deep down.  There's no more and no less to her character than that.<br />Also, the dust jacket makes mention of the fact that Scottoline's books are often used by bar associations to present case studies on ethical conflicts for lawyers, so I assumed that I wouldn't need to deal with silly scenarios that would never happen between opposing counsel in real life.  But Scottoline has an attorney becoming romantically involved with her opposing counsel, and the primary concern is how angry Bennie (Anne's boss) is going to be.  As if non-disclosure to the presiding judge in their case is not a concern and as if the case would be allowed to proceed with the romantic development.  Oh, come on.<br />This book should really only be enjoyed as a brief escape as you're sitting on the beach this summer.  If that's all you're looking for, then you'll be fine.  As I said, there are some moments that make the book worthwhile and the ending, if handled by a lesser practitioner of suspense could have been horrible, but worked here for me.  But, if you're looking for rich characterization and a thriller that will make your head spin, this isn't the book for you.	2002-08-15
US	51900550	R267SNLTK31M7W	0679450041	383312801	The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay: A Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A golden tale of heroes from the Golden Age of Superheroes	This book works for me on so many different levels, I don't know where to begin.  First and foremost, it's a story about comic creators during the Golden Age of comics.  For me, that alone makes this book worth its price.  The fact that the subject matter is handled by an author as gifted as Michael Chabon and is as adroitly researched as it is just makes the story all that much more interesting to me as a lifelong reader and fan of comics.<br />Second, the story of escapism and becoming trapped were compelling themes that made the story an intriguing look into how two men with similar backgrounds acted in very different manners over the course of the story.  After creating the comic character The Escapist, Joe Kavalier spends the next dozen plus years of his life trying to help his family escape from Nazi-occupied Europe, and then trying to escape from his own pain and mistakes later on.  Sam Clay, on the other hand, finds himself increasingly more trapped in his own life, one that he never intended for himself.  Ultimately (and without giving away too much), Kavalier's greatest trick of escape as an amateur escape artist may be in giving Clay his freedom.  <br />This is also a story of friendship between two men, and the story of an immigrant looking for a new home without the comfort and safety of his own family surrounding him.<br />Chabon's writing is absolutely lyrical and you can almost feel the cadence and rhythm in certain passages.  My only complaint about the writing is that often, Chabon makes full use of his obviously broad base of vocabulary, possibly losing the reader in places.  Still, that only happens once every hundred pages or so, and plodding through those sections is well worth the experience of reading the entire novel, certainly one of the best American novels of the past few years.	2002-08-06

For someone who was a little overwhelmed at the amount of stuff out there that's targeted towards new parents (read:  designed to guilt new parents into buying their schlock so you don't feel like you're neglecting your child), this book was a breath of fresh air.  Realisitically, neither I nor my wife would have ever completely made use of a straightforward baby memories book, and in fact, I have yet to meet anyone who actually did.  This book, on the other hand, is entertaining by itself so you don't feel that its purchase was a complete waste even if you never fill in any of its pages.<br />Some gems from the pages include:  &quot;Diameter of baby's head&quot; followed thereafter by &quot;Diameter of hole baby's head came through.&quot;  There are places to record baby's first projectile vomit, and even baby's first DWI.  There's even a ledger of expenses you can fill out which start out with hospital expenses and even include cost of spring break, cost of first auto repair, and cost of &quot;finding oneself&quot;.<br />This is funny, funny stuff.  It's not intended to be a serious memory book for any child, but it provided me, a parent, with plenty of giggles.	2002-07-22
US	51900550	R4U7OE59ZOY5V	1585671975	689113993	The Company: A Novel of the CIA	Books	4	10	10	N	Y	A great spy thriller with plenty of political intrigue	I confess to not having much experience with the genre of spy novels, but regardless, The Company was immensely satisfying for my first foray into the field.  Make no mistake, this book is more like Thirteen Days than it is like James Bond.  Littell relies more on the tension of a highly combustible political situation for the drama and excitement in this book, rather than straight on action sequences.  For me, this formula worked.<br />The Company takes the reader through a series of events that were typical of the major events of the Cold War:  (1) a failed defection; (2) the failed revolution in Hungary; (3) the Bay of Pigs fiasco; and (4) the attempted coup to overthrow Gorbachev.  The in-depth looks into the behind-the-scenes events surrounding these historical events, albeit fictional, are still incredibly engrossing and read like non-fiction.  <br />And unfortunately, that is one of the book's major failings as well.  The characters never rang true for me.  The speech patterns of each character is nearly indiscernable from the rest.  Dialogue often seems unnatural or forced.  While Littell tries to firmly root his story in real world historical events, credulity is strained when we're asked to believe that the same characters who start the book out as friends, eventually rise to take on the most powerful roles in the CIA, all the while placing their children in subservient roles.  I don't know if the real CIA encouraged nepotism or not, but this rang hollow for me.<br />What was probably the most unnecessary evil of this book, however, was the many typos that appeared throughout its text.  It was really quite maddening.  The most egregious was on page 829 where the words \\"Unites States\\" appear.  A proper editing job would have enhanced my enjoyment of this book immensely.  This is not a knock on Littell, but rather, on Overlook Press.  Hackneyed editing just make The Company appear amateurish.<br />Otherwise, however, this book was a fine attempt to draw fiction from the Cold War.  With the perspective of the 21st Century, Littell shows with great realism what was probably taking place during the post-WWII era in the shadows and behind closed doors.  A wonderfully entertaining read.	2002-07-03
US	51900550	R1W03BAOAJTQI	0670030732	254708177	Fox Girl	Books	2	5	9	N	N	It breaks my heart to say it, but this book left me cold	This book held so much promise.  Like her first movel, Comfort Woman, Okja Keller's Fox Girl promised me the tale of a forgotten victim of war: the off-spring of American G.I. and Korean hookers.  Theirs is a story that needs to be told.  Much like Comfort Women, these children are a forgotten people and are often ignored in Korean society, as if the entire society hopes these children would just go away.<br />Unfortunately, Fox Girl never really worked for me.  It's difficult for me to say why.  Thankfully, the book never sunk to the self-pitying depths of Ten Thousand Sorrows, which was a genuine fear of mine as I started reading the book.  I suppose the main criticism for me was that the characters never really came alive and felt real.  To one degree or another, each character lacked depth and their relationships with each other never really rang true for me (except for the lead character's relationship with her adoptive daughter at the end).<br />One final note of caution:  There are portions of this book that are genuinely disturbing, as one might expect from a book centering around the off-spring of prostitutes.	2002-06-25

I saw it in my local Border's and noticed he was a local (Washington, DC) crime novelist, which fascinated me.  After I bought the book, but before I began reading it, I read an article about Pelecanos and Hell to Pay in a major weekly magazine (it might have been Entertainment Weekly) which built up Pelecanos as one of the freshest new voices in crime fiction today.  So by the time I started reading Hell to Pay, my expectations may have been a bit high.<br />Regardless, I came away disappointed.  The plot was fairly thin.  Everything that took place could have fit into three or four chapters.  There were no real twists or turns that made me feel compelled to keep turning the pages.  Additionally, there were several scenes of . . . intimacy . . . that just felt like they didn't belong in the story at all.  They seemed a little gratuitous (but certainly not overly indulgent).  The characters all seemed relatively contrived.  <br />The redeeming features of this book are the snapshots of life in Washington, DC it provides.  Pelecanos' Washington is not the Washington that you will see on The West Wing or any feature film.  This is a story of the real people that live and work in Washington everyday.  Also, the dialogue seemed very real to me, which is an important element of any piece of fiction.<br />In the end, this was not an unpleasant read, but there are many more books I would recommend above Hell to Pay.	2002-06-25

A Dateline special I can understand.  Neither of these individuals are very interesting let alone sympathetic.  Sheila's second husband, Jamie, was not likable at all.  Everyone was a two-dimensional cardboard cutout.  Allen was the controlling, overbearing, conniving, abusive ex-husband.  Sheila was the dedicated, loving wife, and hapless victim to be.  I got the sense from the book that there was more to Sheila's character than that, but Rule never chooses to protray her with any depth.<br />The narrative was not fun to read.   I thought that Rule jumped around unnecessarily from time period to time period, and this is especially true when she jumped around when telling the story of the weeks leading to Bellush's death.<br />True crime stories always draw me in, simply for the human drama.  Unfortunately, I felt no drama in this story.	2002-06-25

I'm a bit surprised at the reactions of some of my friends who have read the book and the reactions of some of the reviewers here on Amazon.  While I recognize there are some difficulties with the book, overall, I think Franzen weaves a highly entertaining tale about a midwestern family and constructs a story that's strangely heartwarming at the end.<br />The beginning of the book is admittedly a bit painful to read.  Franzen attempts to draw us into the world of Parkinson's Disease/dimentia by use of his narrative style in the opening chapter/prologue.  Once past that section, however, (and once the reader gets past another similar narrative later on in the book) it's hard to put the book down.  Something is constantly happening, and I was continuously surprised at how deftly Franzen moved between different time periods and different stories of the individual family members with a series of fairly seamless transitions.  Franzen's narrative really drew me into the story, and by the end, I felt I really knew each character as well as I could know any fictitious character.  While each had his/her failings, in the end, Franzen had me caring about what happened to all of them in spite of their faults, and sometimes, because of them.<br />For me, the ending was strangely uplifting in a way.  Without spoiling it here, the characters' stories are wrapped up in a fashion that was, to me, very heartwarming.  Franzen's writing style is fluid, crisp, and fun to read.  I wish I did anything half as well as Franzen can write.<br />I've recommended this book to everyone I know who enjoys reading.	2002-06-25

If you have any interest in big business and how it impacts on everyday life of everyday people, you will enjoy this glimpse inside ADM.  The overarching story about a vast international conspiracy to fix prices is a gripping story of personal and corporate greed run amok.

The story told here shows how much can go on in the world of corporate America to affect the lives of every person.

This book is so much more than that.  I couldn't do the book any justice by trying to describe it in a sentence or two.  Empire Falls is simply one of the most touching human dramas I have ever read.  This book works on so many different levels, it's easy to see why it won the Pulitzer.  Some of the many sub-plots include: the heartwarming story of a father's relationship with his teenage daughter and his heartfelt desire for her to have a better life; a mother experiencing a mid-life crisis and trying to recapture a youth she never experienced in the first place; a years-long, unspoken and unrequited love between co-workers; and the ever-maddening, often comic, always tragic relationship between Miles Roby and Mrs. Whiting.  At times, the stories Russo relates about these characters made me laugh out loud.  A truly spectacular book, one which will forever be one of my favorites of all time.	2002-06-25

It's  clear that the book may have benefitted from the work of a ghost-writer,  but at the same time, an autobiography from a man an straightforward as Mr.  Foley would have seemed disingenuous with one.  In short, this book is an  open and honest look at the business of wrestling (although Mr. Foley  skirts the issue of genuine heat between Owen Hart and Steve Austin), that  is at times rambling, but nonetheless extremely enjoyable.	1999-11-09
