There is a weekly look at your pregnancy (instead of \\"What to Expect\\"s monthly look), and great detail about health, labor, nursing, buying baby products, and more.<br /><br />I cannot recommend \\"Great Expectations\\" more heartily.	2005-05-16

I enjoyed \\"The Queen's Fool\\" almost as much, although I don't think it was as strong a book. But \\"The Virgin's Lover...\\" Let's just say it's tough to find good things to say about it.<br /><br />This novel seemed to drag. Unlike the previous books in the series, it also seemed scattered. Instead of the book focusing on the impressions and life of a central character, \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" attempts to use Amy Dudley in a similar way, but must move on to Cecil and Lord Dudley for views of the court.<br /><br />In addition, some of the characters seemed quite changed from when we first met them in \\"The Queen's Fool.\\" Amy Dudley came across as a nearly insane, bipolar character in \\"Fool,\\" but is not portrayed in this light at all in \\"Lover.\\" Lord Dudley is shown fairly molesting Elizabeth in \\"Fool,\\" making us all assume they must have a somewhat physical relationship already, but in \\"Lover,\\" it's as if they've never been anything but friends until their physical relationship begins later in Elizabeth's reign. Etc.<br /><br />I haven't given up hope for Gregory, though, and I still eagerly anticipate her next novel.	2005-05-10

Hatcher's style is easygoing, and moves along while it still gives details. Unlike some genre novelists, she could be called a \\"good\\" writer, as well as someone who knows how to tell a good tale.<br /><br />There's nothing very deep about this novel; it's a tale of a woman fighting her heart, and trying to balance career with love. But it's the perfect novel to read when you just want to get away from the world for a while.	2004-10-12

It will keep you engaged throughout.<br />Yancey makes no bones about the fact that he's Christian and has a Christian perspective. This book is not about currently-popular-but-difficult-to-prove-historically notions about Jesus (like: he had a wife, he had a child, etc.). This book is about getting to know Jesus more intimately by understanding his background, his Jewishness, his world.<br />Yancey is a superb writer, and brings up many ideas rarely discussed in the Christian world. I think every Christian will learn something from this book, and non-Christians can come closer to understanding who the Christ of Christianity is.	2004-06-17

I bought this book thinking it would be a useful tool when creating shoes for stage productions. I didn't really think the end result would be \\"good enough\\" for everyday wear. But I was wrong.<br />This book is really pretty amazing. I would have thought a host of expensive and hard-to-find tools and materials would have been necessary to create \\"real\\" shoes, but that's not necessarily true, as laid out in this book. Sure, if you want leather shoes (as opposed to fabric), it will cost a little, but you can make one of the more simple designs in this book and not have to invest a lot of dough. The author even suggests taking the finished upper portion of your shoe to a shoe repair shop to have soles put on it...Sound wonderful to me, although I haven't tried to find a shop locally to see if that's really do-able.<br />At any rate, if you want to make serious shoes, this book is definitely for you. And if you just want costume shoes, you can take the basic principles found in this book and do that, too.	2003-01-12

Here are practical projects and ideas for small and small-ish gardens that go beyond decking and basic benches. I felt the book could have been a little more innovative, but overall, that it was creative and realistic.<br />The book begins with basic information about the value of adding height, a terraced area, seating, paths, shelter, water, light, and a children's area to your garden, then offers tips on planning a garden out, working with what you already have. There's also a section on buying and using \\"hard  landscaping\\" (like stone and gravel). Tips on choosing plants and using containers are given, too, along with info on laying a lawn down.<br />Then we get on to the really good stuff: The projects. Here you'll find a \\"chamomile seat\\" (something mostly unknown in the U.S., but basically a seat with herbs growing in it that will release a wonderful fragrance when you sit down), a very formal lawn, a rather boring and basic oak bench, a rather mundane wildflower border, a simple water feature that doesn't require the pumps and such of a full out pond, a pretty decorative screening made with wire and ivy, a children's \\"wigwam\\" made of willows and plants, a basic color-themed border, a \\"low maintenance courtyard\\" with an Asian flair, very basic lighting with mason jars and tea lights, obelisks, a formal knot garden, steps with herbs growing from them (again, they release a great scent when stepped upon), a very basic sun canopy, something called a \\"children's play fort\\" that looks more like a fenced in area surrounding a tree, a Japanese-inspired screen, an Asia-inspired mosaic made from pebbles, some turf sculpture (grassy mounds and the like), a cute kitchen garden, an easy-to-contruct pergola made from ropes and a few pieces of timber, some pathways, a more formal fountain and pebble stream, and a paving maze.<br />I'm glad to have this addition to my library, and am sure it will inspire me to spend more than a few weekend adding personality and pizzazz to my garden.ry, and am sure it will inspire me to spend more than a few weekend adding personality and pizzazz to my garden.	2003-01-12

You should have a basic foundation in knitting before you pick it up, however.<br />What I love about this book is that there are several small sized, unintimidating projects for those new to lace knitting--as well as increasingly difficult projects as your experience grows.<br />But a very serious issue with this book is that there are NO GAUGES. None. Not even some to get you steering on the right path. This is a major obstacle for the beginning lace knitter.

(And quite a few of the given projects are silly; for example, eight pages are devoted to making a lemonade stand and supposedly cute things to go with it.)<br />If you want photographs of projects to inspire you to come up with your own things, then this book becomes more useful. However, I just don't think many of the ideas are very creative; many are just re-hashed. For example, a number of pages are devoted to flowers on porches and windows. But nothing I can't find in any issue of a decorating or gardening magazine is shown here; it's very basic stuff.<br />Nonetheless, I did get one of two good ideas from the book: Turning floor lamps into &quot;aged&quot; pedestals or plant holders, and some specifics on making twig trellises.<br />Overall, however, this book is disappointing, and seems overpriced for such a slim volume. I'd recommend you buy a few gardening magazines instead.	2002-07-24

(and some weird stuff, too)	If you like the Victorian style, I think you'll love many of the designs in this book. I've never seen knitting patterns like this before, and find this book extraordinary.<br />There's an afghan that takes it's inspiration from Victorian needlepoint (a.k.a., Berlinwork), with a black background and jewel tone fruits; a striking Christmas afghan with a dark background and trumpeting angels; a cable afghan with raised fruits; a diamond lace afghan with insertions of ribbon; a knitted photo frame; a cute &quot;gentleman's sampler&quot; that looks like it's a quilt made of squares from old sweaters; and knitted lampshade covers that are very feminine and Victorian/Edwardian. There's also an amazing afghan that's inspired from an old tapestry. The piece de resistance is an afghan that looks like it's copied from an 18th or early 19th century embroidery sampler.<br />Then there are items that would fit into any home: A classy cable afghan &amp; pillow; a glorious counterpane afghan and pillow that's very feminine; a diamond afghan; some pretty pillows; and an afghan with what looks like appliqued knitted leaves on it.<br />I also really appreciate the few doily patterns that are included.<br />There are wackier things, too, which I like less: Knitted animal pillows; three-dimensional fruits for a fruit bowl; a not-very-attracrtive teddy bear; a fur pillow; an afghan featuring a golfer and a pillow that looks like a giant golf ball; and some &quot;celestial&quot; and almost hippie looking designs.<br />This book's problem doesn't come so much from it's designs, in my opinion, as from the difficulty of the projects. A few might be suitable for a beginner (some of the pillows and maybe the lampshades); others are rated &quot;intermediate,&quot; but it seems that most are pretty complicated.<br />Even so, this book is inspiring, if nothing else!
