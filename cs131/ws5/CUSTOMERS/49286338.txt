Here is a book that shows how and why the Rabbis of old tell parables - to enlighten the understanding of the reader using examples of course! Reading Jesus' cryptic parables no more than 50 or 60 in all and many which are of a limited thematic nature, is a very different experience from this selection of 100 parables from the 1000s listed from the early Jewish writings. This book and the NT parables of course brings interesting comparisons, but shows how telling stories is a very Jewish way to get a point across.     It is a great way to get in touch with the thinking of the early rabbis and Jewish ethical teaching. The parable details are reflective of real people and the tales are embellished with the  banter of the rabbis. They are stylistically very different than in the NT. I recommend this delightful book to both Jews and Christians who are interested in the Jewish moral perspective.	2005-04-13

This book once it was published two hundred years later, was instrumental to free-thinkers in the Enlightenment including Voltaire and was a object of passionate debates. It is considered a forerunner of textual criticism of the NT. I was amazed that the old passages fundamentalist (protestant) Christians trot out, have been debated for centuries.  Even the most obscure ones that I've heard about!<br /><br />This is a very powerful polemic work, if just worth reading the introduction (why it was written). No rabbi that I've come across has ever been as effective as Troki is in his book in refuting the Jesus Messiah question. If anything, most rabbis appear to ignore the messiah question for harmony purposes or refer to the Talmud on the subject.  After all there's alot more to Judaism than the messiah!<br /><br />If you are Jewish and want to know why(?) try to get a used copy and take a look. A scanned version can be purchased online for about $55.  If you are a Christian, this book will give you a valuable religious perspective which is based on the same texts you share. If you are a committed Christian, it shouldn't take your faith away.	2005-04-06

I gave this three stars only because it was a bit fluffy. Though a more substancial book would've been almost as long as the NT itself, this is sufficint for the uninitiated, for it shows how contradictory and unfair the \\"Good Book\\" can be. The bible's underbelly is divided into six sections: 1. people and their place in society, 2. power of the church, 3. behavior (pretty sick one here!), 4. guilt, crime, and punishment (this section is even sicker!), 5. way things ought to be, and 6. science, medicine, and the world. The only section they left out is faith and belief!    I couldn't help but feel some better biblical quotes had been left out in this edition. This is especially true of topics that are a red flag for me (science, women roles, etc. - I am a female engineer).  But this basic book is a good one add to your bookcase because it will remind you never to take the bible too literally.	2005-04-05

In this book Maccoby makes some illuminating points on Judas (greek for Judah) as a stand-in for the jewish people, and somehow actually rehabilitates Judas. Bonus material includes: deconstructing the attonement myth that requires a betrayer or \\"black christ\\" in Judah, rehash of medevil passion plays and some interesting composites made from anomalous judas/brothers/apostles material in the NT.     I read this in a day, being only a ~160pg book. Some missed opportunities here that were a disappointment include: parallels to \\"the kiss\\" to the kissing of the Torah scroll (ie kissing you goodbye) and more elaboration of the role of evil and human sacrifice in Judaism. Maccoby really does not delve into this material where the Advarsary is considered helpful, including the \\"evil\\" inclination which can derive good. Obviously, these additudes have developed alongside Christian's identification of the Jews as evil anyway, a pariah people. A comparison between the nature or role of evil in Judaism vs. Christianity's switch against the Jews would have made the book more significant. The collective blood libel ('let his blood be upon us and our children' - Matt 27:22) of deicide and other remarks against Jews (such as Jesus accusing the Jews of devil worship John 8:44) does not begin with Judas. Judas was just an accessory character, probably a symbolic one.     Another thing is his exageration of anti-semetism today. In America in the 21st century, you have jews as vice-presidential nominations, senators, etc. in every civic and professional role. Great strides have been made in the judeo-christian dialogue since WWII, and the role of Judas has been made more innocous. Many Christians may even be shocked at the association between Judas and the Jews. But Maccoby is right that such themes still resonate in our culture - and of course played a hand in the manifestations of non-religious political movements such as fascism and communism. As he said there are differences between a \\"catholic\\" atheist and a \\"jewish\\" atheist due to their religious/societal orientations.    This book is for Maccoby fans only. Despite my disagreement with some of the material, his brilliance is obvious. Its always interesting to read a talmud scholar's dissections of the NT. Even if you don't agree (and I'm not saying I don't mind you) you must like the way he turns the picture upside down and backwards!	2005-02-21

If anyone hadn't heard his name before, just a reminder, this author was the Assistant Secretary of State during the Reagan era. His book these reads like a report on Jewish life in illreverant America. While his argument on the state of Jewish idenity is well defended, (ie, like minimizing the religious aspect of the Jewish idenity and having major jewish organizations not supporting the religiously observant publically has lead to a loss of jewish poeple #s, etc.) it has some obvious flaws.     For example, he says that today's role of the Christian right and anti-semetism has been overexagerrated and feared by Jews. Great strides in the Christian-Jewish dialigoe has minimize hate teaching and proselytizing of jews by christian organizations. There is a great acceptance of Jews as senators,etc and other community leadership roles. And true, fundamentalists and evangetical organizations are no longer targeting jews per se and actually support Israel. But what is ignored is that they no longer have to directly. Why there are separate organizations that allow jews to do it to themselves. They are called Jews for Jesus and Messianic synagogues! There are over 100 messianic synagogues in Israel alone! Why no mention in the book? These outreach efforts are funded by the very evangetical organizations jews should not fear in allowing support to their religious political/educational agendas - in exchange of orthodox jewish ones.    Another example that struck me a bit off is the \\"abandonment\\" of the outreach to jews of mixed ethnic origins (\\"half\\" and \\"quarter\\" jews). Granted he does not say this directly, but he suggests money being more well spent in educating the remaining full jews from marrying outside the faith completely, regardless of a spousal conversion. To me this would be like jewish suicide, in denying the rest of the jewish population how they choose to idenify themselves as jews. If anything, jews of mixed ethnic or faith backgrounds need a special kind ofsensitivity otherwise, they will deny their 'jewish self' all the more easily.     Lastly, there are divisions in the Jewish community on Israel due to their inability to create a peaceful solution with their neighbors, the Palestinians. Flag waving at the synagogues only help so much. The issue is not properly dealt with in this book which gives Abrams' book a false sense of authenticity.    Of course I recognize the problems Jews faced today. As a convert who has jewish relatives both though my step-father and now a jewish husband, I wonder how did I ever get into this mess! The jewish people have conflicts within their faith as well as outside of it, quite unique from say Irish or Italian american intermarriage to the protestants (though his comparisons to those groups are interesting). Identification with ourselves as a group must be more liberal that of the original torah. In this sense 'jewish survival' will depend more on the oral tradition of reinterpreting the original precepts of the jewish faith rather than the narrow view of jewish identification which he sees as the only way for Jews to exist as fully jews.  And NO it does not mean that a Christmas tree needs to be put in a lobby of the Reform synagogue as he insinuates! Geez!	2005-02-19

It is a very pro-jewish look at the role of resurrection in jewish religious literature (Talmud, Tanakh, midrash, etc.) with refreshing results. It does not try to create a syncretism of the two religions but shows that Christianity is a \\"fellow faith\\" with its own purpose with God. The book also clearly states why resurrection is not enough for proof of Messiahship in Judaism. Brilliant!    The introduction is largely written for the Christian audience which puts Judaism in its place within its own religion (Christianity). Personnally, I did not like but it is a good connective beginning for the Christian. If your Jewish, I suggest that you read the book first then the introduction.  Translation quality is also superb. This book gets a big thumbs up! Too bad such popular authors as Rabbi H. Kushner doesn't treat the interfaith dialogue with as much sensitivity as this author does [see Kushner's To Life].	2004-11-04

It is in the form of a novel with headings at the top that provide the chapter and verse markings rather than in columns, a refreshing difference. The translation is very up-to-date, meaning in St. Mathew's gospel \\"virgin\\" has been translated as \\"maiden\\" (you KNOW what I'm referring to). If you must read the NT, this one will be a good one for you.  Lattimore's translation is a lively curious read. The style of this translation reads like a novel, not a religous text per se. If you have difficulty with the typical dry biblical prose of the NT, this translation will work for you. I can now say that I've read the entire NT and can make my own judgement on it.  I've compared other bibles to this one (RSV and KJ) selecting random passages and it is a true translation.	2004-10-24

Each gospel was written for a particular audience with its own religious oral history and take on the OT [when the OT no longer was the \\"Tanakh\\" but a  complication of predictions or signs about the future messiah Jesus]. Each author was trying reconcile disparate pieces of information that was available at that time. Hence some dissatifation with the early \\"Mark\\" gospel and its subsequent embellished by \\"Luke\\" and \\"Matthew\\" and the abandonment of \\"Mark\\" by \\"John\\". Helms draws interesting comparisons (some old, some new) between the gospels as well as with situations and phrases (in greek) from Isaiah, Elijah, later prophets, Psalms, and Daniel as well as the occasional pagan and Buddhist references. It is the comparisons between the Greek in the OT vs. NT that allows this book to stand out.    I have read a few books already on this type of topic so I'm a bit jaded. Its too bad about the author's title choice and emphasis of \\"fictional narrative\\" of the gospels otherwise he would have a larger readership. However this is not a bad book for its 150pgs and I have learned new things about the NT's relationship with the Greek OT.	2004-10-23

He examines rabbinical writings, talmud law and logic, heretical treasies etc. in his dissection of \\"Paul's NT\\". This volume turns over the stones that get in the way of studing the New Testament, then presents a plausible theory (story) that can explain them. As a child and young adult these very real \\"inconsistencies\\" or \\"contradictions\\", did get away in my religious education that a simple \\"faith\\" did not wave away. These include: the additutes of the Pharisees toward Jesus and the Jesus movement, Paul's curious yet insistent claim to be a Pharisee, the mentioning of various Jewish sects (or religious leadership) vs. \\"the jews\\", the apparent acceptance of Torah law by the apostles who knew Jesus best vs. St. Paul, and many others. All these things were quite apparent to me even as a child and cause the NT stories to look absurd. One can see why the NT was largely kept to a priestly caste to interpret for a thousand years!<br /><br />There are a few small drawbacks to his writing worth mentioning. His conclusions in his book occasionally get reinforced as \\"facts\\" which can be a bit annoying. His conclusions on Jesus are based on selective material from the NT in his attempt to separate J's more pharisaical views from the more hellenistic additions to the story. The book who primary readership will most likely be Jewish or Agnostic, really should be familar with the new testament to understand the bulk of his points. There are plenty of Jews and Christians who have never read Acts or the Letters to any degree that can allow them to truly access Maccoby challenges to the text. Otherwise this is an exceptional book worth reading.<br /><br />Its a pity that ardent Christians will most likely not be open to these types of challenges to their own texts, when books like this are needed to keep our religious perspectives honest. Maccoby's observations on for example the corn plucking incident on the Sabbath or the Nazarene version of the Noahide laws are truly important insights worth revisiting in the NT.n plucking incident on the Sabbath or the Nazarene version of the Noahide laws are truly important insights worth revisiting in the NT.	2004-10-18

I learned a lot about this movement, including the racial boundaries set up by messianic temples (gentile vs. \\"originally\\" jewish), and of course, their evangelical roots. The Rabbi although clearly rejecting the group, makes good arguments at the end as to why this group should be accepted as \\"jewish\\" and a part of the Jewish Community. I don't know myself. While I am facinated at the possible blending of Christianity and Judaism, as a Jewish convert raised Epsicopal, I found the blending too odd - even ridiculous. Judaism doesn't need Christianity for it to be meaningful, holy or complete. Judaism is too self-examining to really fit in with Evangelical Christianity. Judaism is about Jews; Christianity is about Jesus, who also happens to be a Jew. That's a BIG difference! All today's Jewish rituals, they were not practiced the same way in Jesus' time (remember all those sacrifices in the Temple...). Today's Judaism is not Jesus' Judaism, which he rebelled against, not by a long shot.    Of couse I am just a Christian Apostate (the worst kind according to NT!) so what do I know? As things are though, perhaps in another 100 years, various forms of Jewish-Christianity will be the Jewish community core and the other strictly Jewish sects the splinter groups (orthodox, conservative)?  This is an important researched document that should be read by all Jews and Christians. Messianic jews aren't the \\"boogey man\\".  Though prosetlyzing is quite annoying to say the least, messianic jews should have a role in our continuing Judeo-Christian dialogue and the jewish community should hopefully one day accept their \\"jewishness\\", even if as their ugly stepchild.	2004-05-30

I was raised Christian but now I am marrying a Jew and have decided to convert to have a single faith marriage. <br />To start with, this book is written for Christians (emphasis), not Jews per se, so it goes into some repetition to emphasize its distinctions between Jewish interpretations of the Torah vs. Jesus' intepretations. I like its candor and it is very respectful of the Christian viewpoint. Though the writing at times can be a bit \\"klunky\\", I read the book quickly in a two day period so it is not too theroetical and states its main points clearly. What is discusses includes: interpretation of the Sabbath; ritual purity vs ethics; God's (Moses/Scripture)thou and community message vs Jesus' I and you message; following the religious message vs. any conflict to commitment to parents, etc.  <br />My only drawback to this book is that the Rabbi considers Judaism \\"the only way\\" not \\"a way\\", hence his rightness on his position again and again. Judaism (at least Reform) doesn't take this stance, and when looking at the chapter headings, I feared a hidden negative diatribe against Christianity. But not to worry! If anything, he goes over backwards trying not to offend Chrsitians, even at the cost of his fictional \\"dialogue\\" with Jesus (who wants to be accused of putting words in his mouth?)<br />Book gets five stars from me.

Bought this book at a small bookstore local to my house when I couldn't find the book I wanted. Anyway, for starters the book is not offensive in its dailogue to Christians or assumes that all Christian theology is Catholism (which seems to be a common error among Rabbis)! It even doesn't imply that one religious position is more correct over another! Just for that it get five stars from me! Chapter titles includes: &quot;God is Nice (sometimes)&quot;, God is not so Nice (sometimes), &quot;God creates&quot;, &quot;God redeems&quot;, &quot;God can Change&quot; etc. The Rabbi is reform and quotes Kaplan, Maimonides, Kushner and other lesser knowm theologists. Quotes Psalms 13, 44, Job, Jonah, &quot;Torah&quot; with multiple meaning (not just the first five books!) etc. Discusses the liberal vs traditional and how these differing Judaic viewpoints relates to Christians. Touches upon uncomfortable subjects such as Numbers 31.<br />I highly recommend this book to Christians in relationships with Jews (dating, married or just friends), Christians considering conversion or even to Christians curious about how their perspective religion relate to Judaism. I wish when growing up my Church (or even my parents) gave me a book like this so I could understand other religious viewpoints better.<br />I have read more sophiticated books which cover this type of material in more depthbut sometimes you just need something simple! Especially if you are not a literalist (or just a three-day/year Jew or a Two-day/year Christian). The author is not preachy and successfully adds to our spiritual dialogue (does not try to sell his religion like Kushner's &quot;To Life&quot; is guilty of...).

This book's critique of the Bible is amazingly sound considering it is 130 years old. His point of view is however as a Christian judging topics in the holy books of Moses, not as a Jew. This may sound like a silly point, but if you read any Talimud writings, stories and parables are a very Jewish way to get a point across! Hence, when discussing God, you must speak of the limits of knowledge and human existance, etc...Anyway, I wish he attended the Reform movement synagogue once in a while in his day...He would have found out the Jews consider sex a blessing, something you SHOULD do on the Sabbath, not be threatened with Hell and mope aound wishing you were outside... I suspect if his book was about the New Testament some resentful Christian would have lynched him!  Good thing the Jews have a sense of humor ;)...<br />Nuff said...This book should be read by anyone who is considers himself Christian or Jewish. And yes I am still converting too!

So, with that it mind and that the Rabbi's sect is conservative, this book is an excellent encapsulation of Jewish being and thought. Its like a mini intro-to-judaism class! However, its Jewish-Christian dialogue is a bit too offensive - a major drawback to the book.<br /><br />Why does one group have to be so defensive and deny the other groups beliefs in... whatever? The Rabbi's remarks in this book are very UNjewish! Shouldn't Judaism be able to stand up on its own without the \\"putdowns\\" of the \\"other\\" religion (ie Christianity)? It almost seems that the Rabbi is afraid that he needs these comparisons to keep Jews away from an apostate faith. There are wonderful things about Judaism that does not need a constant Christian comparison to bring out. By the way, Jews think Christians can go to heaven too, so why not just bring up the Noahide Laws instead or emphasize the lack of a jewish concept of an eternal Hell? Deconstructing Christianity isn't necessary. Also, considering since both the Jewish and Christian sects are morally based, and if I am truly considering conversion, aren't I not just a \\"Christian without Christ\\"? Both religions really need to stress their common beliefs than their differences for true Peace on Earth. The author's perspective on this is suprising since his first book was so inclusive. Again this is my only negative comment on his book.<br /><br />To balance this insensitivity, I recommend to the potential convert or returnee this book: Resurrection of Jesus: A Jewish Perspective by Pinchas Lapide, an orthodox rabbi. It treats the Jewish-Christian issue withthe respect it deserves and it draws very original examples from midrash, talmud sources.  Its important to include a proper dialogue if its going to be brought up at all because so many jews today are either in relationships with christians or have relatives who are.in relationships with christians or have relatives who are.	2004-02-05
US	49286338	R284TPHI16J5V0	0791440125	267927743	An Introduction to the Kabbalah (Suny Series in Judaica: Hermeneutics, Mysticism, and Religion)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Very Informative	This book is well written and uses a \\"scientific\\" viewpoint. Its translation into English is well done. I am converting to Judaism and wanted to know more about the spiritual side of Biblical interpretation (Its also good to understand what the Kabbalah is since all Rabbis are learned Kabbalists, whether practising it or not!). The only drawback that it does not have a glossary of defined terms and assumes that the reader is familar with some basic Judaic terminology. Otherwise, I highly recommend it.	2004-01-15

Though this books additudes were a bit outdated towards interfaith relationships and does not recognize the wide spread intermarriage phenomenom, the author has a good handle on the issues affecting the Jewish identity. It is a very conservative approach to raising your child with a Jewish Identity, with a focus on early religious/cultural training.	2003-12-31

Excellent reading, even if a bit too long. Poor McWilliams certainly got his share of bad Karma! This is the first book of his that I've read and it was worth every penny. Now I'm going to have to buy at least one more (must make sure it doesn't have J-R's name on it!).	2003-09-28
US	49286338	R3TKDOSBBC0ZCE	0312092962	395460704	Outrageous Betrayal: The Real Story of Werner Erhard from Est to Exile	Books	5	32	63	N	Y	Read it  for the much needed other perspective	I was surfing Amazon and then saw what happened to my book review. So I figure I'd edit it.    To start off, I'm a happily married engineer with two degrees. My life works great! I was a struggling working college student ten years ago when I took these EST/Forum courses and got bilked! Plus I needed some therapy afterwards to boot! Did I get a refund? Nope! Did my old friend who had got into their courses get coaching from good old Landmark to stop his contact with me because I \\"distracted him from his progress\\" with it? Yep!    This book not only dishes out deliciously dirt on Werner Erhard but also gives a great history lesson on the New Age/Personal Growth seminar movement. I took the Forum and one seminar of theirs and ...DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM. Their \\"technology\\" is about developing an emotional dependence on the organization in order to achieve \\"breakthroughs\\" in your life. These breakthroughs include encouraging divorce, job loss/changes, dropping close friends and inducting others into the forum for personal growth, etc. Everyone I ran across coming to the Forum to work on their marriage ended breaking up. As with any questionable organization, thought reform techniques applied in the Forum include challenges to your belief system using psychological coercion. Sounds pretty weird or scary huh? The book does a good job showing this aspect of Landmark (or whatever they call themselves).    Don't risk your mind, your relationships and your financial well-being until you've read this book and done a healthy search on the net. Be an informed shopper of LGAT and other corporate cults. There are a bunch of them out there! I hope you \\"get it [the book]\\".      Better yet, take your Forum money and spend a weekend in Cancun. The climate is much better for personal growth!	2003-09-28

The book is 10x better than the movie...full of real details. Even though this story was told orally from a vantage point of 60+ years, it is backed up with articles, poice reports,etc. Very credible and tragic story.	2003-06-11
US	49286338	R1KP9RK5HSA916	0897333764	502096068	Five Chimneys: A Woman Survivor's True Story of Auschwitz	Books	5	21	26	N	N	Good but quite sickening	This poor woman, who saved herself by convincing a selection doctor that the captive women need a health clinic, saved many lives as she worked in the underground of the concentration camp. She details the sick \\"experiments\\" that took place there and how she cared for its poor victims if they were returned to the barracks. <br />She also talks how she unknowningly sent her mother and older son to the \\"left\\" during the initial off train selection and physically escaped one selection group herself. She even details how she had to commit murders in order to save lives (hint: Auschwitz did not have a materinity ward). There are many details here about the holocaust. This book, though with so many movies now many events are familar, really attaches names to these occurances and makes it personal.<br />I read this in one sitting and I don't want to read another book on the subject again. It was so sick what happened to millions of people, what they were forced to participate in, and yet mass mutilations and murder around the globe still take place.	2003-02-16
US	49286338	R2ITRF5AAJU6VW	0446530085	219114128	The Bondwoman's Narrative	Books	5	2	2	N	N	a great find	This book is interesting and worth reading because of the way it was found and Gates' efforts in authenicating the work. The book is clearly fictional but its details (treatment of characters, descriptions of locations and plantation houses, etc.) make it obvious that it was drawn from examples in memory: the memory belonging to a mulatto house servant and slave. The author, a mulatto who may even be almost white, makes excellent examples of how it is really an accident of birth who is really \\"white\\" or \\"black\\" and who is the slave or master.    It was very nice to read at the end that she chooses to identify herself as black and be part of free black community, when throughout the book being black or part black was such a stigma.  It is such a shame it took 140 years to let this book be published. I wonder, if this author was only born in this century, how far she would have gone! I really would be surprised if \\"Hannah\\" never wrote anything else after her first book. Maybe in some distant future a collection of letters or other writings will be found bearing her actual name.	2002-07-10
