It seems logical that most of the time the book is better than the movie. Books are simply more discriptive and there is only so much you can put into a two hour flick. But in this case I would recommend both.<br /><br />Back in December I went to see the movie and about three quarters thru it the projector went out. So I had no idea how it ended. A few days later I found myself enthralled with the book at my local bookstore. I love this book so much because the characters seem so real to me. Although, you the person reading this book don't know me personally, I can really identify with the Miles character in the book. And I've had friends that remind me of Jack. I'm not a big wine guy, but I sure learned a lot by reading this book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fiction book with great characters, a great story and a lot of humor, check Sideways out... And then see the movie ;-)	2005-01-22
US	52106364	R143QJVVGH66I1	0071429492	543458646	The Making of the Super Bowl: The Inside Story of the World's Greatest Sporting Event	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Lots of good stuff, but could have been better	Like a previous reviewer mentioned, this book is best when Weiss describes the early years of the Super Bowl. Most casual football fans know of the merger between the AFL and NFL in the 1960's but Weiss goes into great detail about how it all came about. Being a Gen Xer myself, I had know idea of the struggle to get the leagues together. Not to mention all the legal battles they went through. One of the interesting tidbits described later in the book is the NFL's black out policy. I had no idea that if it wasn't court ordered, the NFL probably would not show home games to fans, even with sell outs.<br /><br />If you're a hardcore fan of NFL football and want to learn more about how the SuperBowl came about and the people involved, I would definitely recommend this book. If you're a casual fan, you'll probably find the book a bit tedious with all the minutia Weiss gets into.	2005-01-22
US	52106364	R1MXUIYNA2F5G	0743244974	154204855	Four Trials	Books	5	28	32	N	N	A Great Read	As other reviews have noted, this is not your typical political type book. This book barely even mentions politics. If you're looking for John Edwards views on various policy, you'll have to do some homework elsewhere.<br />I would put this book up there with any great legal novel. The only difference is that the stories are real. I just love this book. Edwards neatly divides up the book into the four trials, each covering 40 to 50 pages. Intertwined with the storytelling of these trials is a brief biography of him and his family. The four trials he discusses are fascinating. They deal with various individuals who have been wronged and how he helped use the legal system to assist them. The book was a real &quot;page-turner&quot; for me. You can easily read a chapter a day and be done within a week.<br />After reading this book, I've come to greatly admire John Edwards the man. I'm a Democrat and had not decided who to vote for in the primary. I am sure I will be voting for Edwards now. (Assuming he is still in the race.) I only hope others will do the same. I think he will make a fine President.	2003-12-31
US	52106364	R2UJD4SMZNW3IY	0385511612	430694437	Bleachers	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Good but unrealistic	I love football and I love John Grisham books. I had high hopes when I began reading Bleachers. I would marginally recommend this book but not unless you're a football fan or at least like Grisham.<br />The book is about a high school quarterback who goes back to his home town when the local coach dies. The town is \\"Messina\\". I'm not sure if this is a real town in the South or fictionalized. I think the state they are in is Georgia. Well, this QB has a lot of demons to get rid of. Namely his relationship with his coach and the high school girlfriend he dumped for the town slut. All the old players do a lot of talking in the \\"Bleachers\\" (hence the name). Funny stories are told and an old game is rebroadcast on a boom box.<br />I liked the plot itself. Some of what I didn't like was the stereotyping of the characters. It seems Grisham likes to paint people in black and white. Everyone in the book was so uniquely different. I guess that's a good thing but in a small town like that it would seem to me that these folks would have much more in common than different. One other thing that bothered me was the football inaccuracies. During the game rebroadcast the opposing team starts the second half by running three plays trying to eat up the clock. By the time they have to punt the clock shows \\"ten and a half minutes\\". Anyone who knows football knows that it would take much more than three plays to burn 4.5 minutes of clock. It's literally impossible with a play clock. Which I know they had because this game took place in 1987. Reading parts like that make it a little un-credible.<br />Overall, Bleachers is a nice little read during football season but I wouldn't go out and buy this book.	2003-12-30
US	52106364	R5EOIREHWCNKT	0375700757	11590154	Cold Mountain: A Novel	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Look at the old reviews first	There are over 1200 reviews for this book already. I'm sure many of us read this book because of the upcoming movie starring Judd Law and Nicole Kidman. (I did). The average review for this book is only 3.5 stars. But if you look at the old reviews first you'll see that back in '97 when nobody knew about the film version most people were giving it 5 stars.<br />I must admit this book started slow for me. I don't read a whole lot of fiction and when I do it's mostly John Grisham type stuff. But I spotted this film on a movie web site and it looked interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. This book was excellent. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the scenery is very rich and detailed. And the book really does flow like a poem. Which makes sense because one of Frazier's inspirations was The Odyssey.<br />I'm not one for long reviews so I'll just say this. If you're at all interested in a this fine novel, read it. Or... go see the movie on XMAS. The buzz is that it's an Oscar contender :-)	2003-11-11
US	52106364	RSXX4GDAZIWXV	0881505498	285679199	The California Coast: A Traveler's Companion, Second Edition	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Where are the web addresses?	I bought this book at my local CostCo recently. I was very excited about a book dedicated exclusively to the California Coast line. I'm a native Californian and enjoy driving along the coast.<br />First, the positives. There are some good essays in the book. In each section there are various writers who give their own personal experiences. I also like the symbols used for the places described in the book. You can get a quick idea of what the area is about. i.e. &quot;Family coast&quot;, &quot;Quiet coast&quot;, &quot;Sporting coast&quot;, etc.<br />Now the negatives. He uses symbols effectively with the coasts but doesn't when it comes to spending money. I'm sure you've seen various travel guides with $$$ signs to give you an idea of how much something cost. In the intro he categorizes the meals and hotels as inexpensive, moderate, and expensive. But when you get to the description of each place you have to read the whole paragraph to find out which it is. $ symbols would be much easier I think. And the most important thing missing (in my opinion) is the absence of web addresses. Virtually every hotel, beach, or park has some kind of web site associated with it now. Addresses to these places would be extremely helpful. He provides phone numbers but I guess he didn't want to take the time to find the web sites of all these places. I've all these &quot;information&quot; lines before and usually the person on the other end is not very helpful.<br />For the price, it's OK I guess. But I would not recommend. There are better guides out there.	2003-08-19

Fast Food Nation is a wonderful book. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to gain some insight on how the industry works. The things I've learned in this book have changed my thinking on where and what to eat. You'll be amazed to find out about some of the things your food goes through before it actually enters your month.<br />I would have given this book five stars but I thought it was somewhat bias. If you've read other reviews, you'll see a lot of people agree with this point. The author does an excellent job of explaining the ills that plague the fast food industry and it's suppliers. But I often found the arguements too one-sided. We live in a capitalist society. The point is to make money. Sometimes the human cost to that is great. But I bet the same people that complain about these tragedies own mutual funds that have these companies' stocks in them. The bottom line is we as individuals have to make informed decisions on the food we buy and the restuarants we patrinize. This book helps in that process.	2002-05-20

Don't be fooled by any negative reviews. Even the most critical of reviews should give it at least three stars.<br />If you're looking for mini-bios about the men pictured on the cover, you will not find it in this book. The book covers the early days of our country like none other I have read. Through 6 important events spanning the first 40 years of our country after the ratification of the Constitution.<br />By focusing on events rather than people, Mr. Ellis can give us a more in depth, objective view of history. For instance, he doesn't take sides in the Burr-Hamilton duel. He tries to present different aspects of these revolutionary personalities.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who even has the smallest interest in this time in history. The book reads easy. You'll feel like you actually spent your time wisely after finishing Founding Brothers.	2002-04-22

I think if people read this book their opinions on prostitution will be much more informed.<br />The author herself entered her research with the stereotypical view of prostitutes. That they were probably women from bad families who resorted to this profession as a last alternative. Or maybe they were drug addicts or whores who couldn't succeed at anything else. She did find those women. But she also found that they were real human beings too. Most view their job as simply that, a job. They were providing a service to men. They took pride in their work, as most of us do.<br />Ms. Albert presents a very objective view of the subject. She goes over some of the pros and cons. Did you know since Nevada starting testing for HIV in 1986 there has not been one case of the virus being spread between customers and hookers? And the girls are checked weekly for STD's by a doctor? But she also talks about the men who get addicted to the girls at the brothels. And the social stigmatizm that exists regarding paid sex.<br />I would have given the book 5 stars but I thought it needed more. More of what, I'm not sure. I would compare this book favorably to Nigger. It is a very interesting read for the open-minded.	2002-04-21

I think that's a little unfair to each of the books individually. I've only read two other Grisham books and I will not do that here.<br />The Rainmaker is a very good book. I have only recently begun to read fiction and this book kept me involved. If you know me personally, you know that most books I start I don't finish. I usually read about 10 to 20 per cent of the book and then shelve it. (Why I do this, I don't know. Short attention span, maybe?) This one I finished. And within about three weeks. I'll admit it seemed a little slow in the beginning. Rudy, the main charactor had a lot of different stuff going on. I wasn't sure where it was all leading. The pace really picked up though. I read the last half of the book in about 4 days.<br />If you just want an entertaining book that deals with the law, I definitely recommend the Rainmaker.	2002-04-19

This is the only book you'll need if you plan on making a trip to the Disneyland Resort. I have found in the past that the &quot;Unofficial&quot; guides give you the real lowdown and this book is no exception.<br />This book covers everything. It tells you the best route to take around the park to cover all the good rides in case you only have a day or too. It goes over how to handle children at Disneyland and what they'll most want to do. If even tells you how to get your kid on a ride two times in a row without waiting. It rates all the hotels in the area in terms of quality and value. In addition, it has chapters on Disney's California Adventure as well as Universal Studios.<br />What I like best about this book is the ride descriptions and ratings. Not only does the author rate the ride, but surveys on each ride have been done and broken down by age group. It tells you how long the ride is, what type of ride it is, how long you'll likely have to wait for the ride and the best times to ride. Not to mention a candid description of the attraction.<br />For anyone visiting Disneyland, this book is well worth the investment, escpecially for under $20.	2001-09-14

I am amazed to see so many reviews from gamblers stating how great a book this is. This book will not help you win at sports gambling! It will only help you lose your money more slowly.<br />There are two simple reasons that the better always loses and they are stated on page two. The bookie makes the spread and when you lose you always pay the bookie more than when you win. Mathematically speaking you have to win 53% of the time just to break even. And that's with a juice (the amount extra you pay the bookie) of 10%. On props and parlays and teasers the juice is much higher.<br />The reason I give this book two stars instead of one is for the pure entertainment value. I read this book cover to cover and this &quot;James Jeffries&quot; is a world class jerk. If anything, this book should make you want to stop betting because of the attitudes of the bookie.<br />If you want to actually become a bookie then I would definitely recommend it. He does miss a few points though like how much of a bankroll you need to start. And I'm curious why one would pay out the day before he collects.<br />I must point out that there are numerous errors in the book also. Mr. Jeffries states that he goes by Vegas odds but he has the 3 team parlay only paying out 5-1 when it should be 6-1. He also believes that half of all college basketball games are played on Sunday when in fact only a handful of televised games are played that day.<br />If you want to know how a bookie acts and feels, read it. Otherwise, don't bother. It won't help you win.	2001-06-26

Since most people who buy books about web development and design need to use books as reference I would probably not suggest it.

The Darwin Awards take a somewhat somber subject and tries to make light of it. And the book does an excellant job doing so. Some of the stories are amazing in the stupidity that these people have. Like the man who was bitten by a cobra but thought he could survive it because &quot;he was a man&quot;.<br />The only thing I would have liked to see would be less Urban Legends.

I was browsing CNN.com one day and there was a favorable review of this book. I've always been a history buff so I thought this book would be very interesting.<br />Don't get me wrong, it is interesting. It's just that each piece is only a few pages long. For instance, what if the Allied Forces had failed on D-Day? What would have been the long range implecations? The nice part about the chapters being short is that it's a very easy read. I can pick it up and just read a little if I want.	2000-12-16

I rarely get a chance to see his show so this book was perfect for me.<br />When Miller was making headlines this summer with his addition to MNF I thought I'd get his latest rants. I was glad I did. The thing I like about this book is that you can pick it up at anytime and have yourself a good laugh. Each chapter is only 4-5 pages long. You don't have to remember what you read the last time you picked up the book because each chapter is a different rant.<br />The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it is all from the tv show. So there is no original material here. If I happened to have seen that episode the book isn't quite as funny.<br />Overall, if you are a Dennis Miller fan, it is definitely worth the price. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong!	2000-12-11
