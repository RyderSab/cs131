Like breaking into Joe Hagan's farm and all that stuff  with Paula. I thought it was pretty dumb how they made a big deal about how big of a racing farm Graytops was, I mean it only had 15 horses at it. That's pretty tiny compared to most barns.

What does he think  Lisa is his own personal  companion and she doesn't have a life of her own  or something.But Alex is not the only one I have a problem with.I also have  a problem with Lisa. She needs to learn to speak her mind.Every time she's  with Alex she just tells him what she thinks he wants to hear,not what  she's thinking.I can  understand if she doesn't want to his feelings or  whatever.But isn't she the one that's always talking about how honest their  relationship is. It's certainly not honest if she can't even tell him her  plans the next day for fear that he might want to come along.I see why she  gets sick of Alex.What gives him the right to expect that Lisa is suppose  to ask him along for a trail ride just because he's her retarted,possessive  boyfriend. Especially considering that he would have had to turn the offer  down anyway since he was going to be busy the next day.If I were Lisa I  would tell him to get lost.<br />Other than these few characters flaws,I found  this book a good read.I thought it was a very good  book.Bonnie Bryant is a  excellent author.	2000-06-25

Usually I like the books I buy enough to read them  again.BUT THIS ONE!This book was boring I tried to read it again after I'd first read it about 7 or 8 months ago and it couldn't hold my attention.Also, who do  Cindy and Glory think they are anyway?Cindy is a brat and Glory suppopsed  to be some wonder horse.@#!#!@$%%!!!!!Whatever!Since when do horses who  break from the gate bad win a 7 furlong maiden race by 20 lengths.How fake  can you get.Then he  wins the Breeders Cup Classic by 31 lenghts,tying  Secretariat for the record,and beating horses  effortessly that he has had  trouble beating in the past.PHONY!PHONY!I think Cindy was acting stupid  thinking that Samantha would be mad at her if Glory beat Shining beat  Shining in the Classic. It was stupid to worry about it,because Samantha's  her sister, and if Samantha's any kind of decent sister,then  she would  have been happy for Cindy,yet dissapointed that Shining didn't win.She  would be feeling both at the same time.I think Miss Bentley needs to think  more about what she's writing and quit making everything perfect and having  Cindy get her way all the time.Plus,why does it seem that every horse that  sets they're hoof on Whitebrook grounds turns into a perfect,always  winning,wonder horse.Come on,even the best training stables in the country  come up with some slouches on the track once in a while.<br />Also,Laviana and  Brad's son is named Lawrence  Hothkins-Ross Townsend,Ross for short,in  these books.Then,in book 33 his name is Parker Townsend. Why is his name  different.What I think is that the author for that book didn't bother to  read these books.Oh well,I stil liked  book 33.<br />Bye.A disappointed  reader.	1999-09-04

If you get a bad grade it's your parents job to  handle it,  not your riding instructors job.<br />-sorry to put you put you down like that  Bonnie,  but I think it's a stupid rule.	1999-08-21

This book was good,but I think the girls are a little bit to young to be dating and kissing.I  mean they're in 7th grade.7th graders don't go around making dates and smooching all the time. They stay out past midnight.And  whenever somebody breaks up with their boyfriend they act like  the sky has  fallen.Come on,my sister is 17 and she doesn't go around making dates all  the time and kissing in her free time.However,I still like the series,even  it's rather unrealistic.	1999-08-01

I liked this book,but Lisa is to much of a perfectionest.She thinks world has ended if gets  a B+ indstead of an A.She thinks she failed if she goes to a horse show and gets 2nd out of what...over 60 riders probably.It was  getting annoying.Especially after the jump-off. I was reading the book and  I got to that part and almost screamed with annoyance.I had to put the book  down and slap it repeatedly with a stuffed animal just so I could control  myself from going out to the mailbox and shipping it of to Timbuktu.PLEASE  Bonnie,let Lisa lighten up a little.Other than that one particular part,I   liked the book.Especially when Stevie told that yucky Margie girl off.That  was funny.	1999-07-31
