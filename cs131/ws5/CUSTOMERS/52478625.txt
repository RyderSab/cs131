And yes, the fame of the author had a role as well in my choice...<br /><br />Nonetheless, I could not enjoy the essay.<br /><br />I use the verb \\"enjoy\\", because this kind of essays are not just helpful, but they are positively \\"pleasant\\" given that they are able to open the reader's view to new landscapes and help the mind to work...<br /><br />Unfortunately this book is too specific... and often I had an unpleasant  impression of aridity and unconcern.<br /><br />I made some guesses to explain the reason, and the most plausible is that the author wrote the essay after some specific university conference: under this hypothesis, you can understand why it is so specific and why it often seems to reply to other theories not explicitly presented.<br /><br />As a reader I was more interested in the \\"secular theory\\"  (to quote the Title) and in the philosophical debate about rights, duties and responsibility. So the first part of the essay (The Origin of Rights) was definitely the one I most desired to read. It was also the most deluding.<br /><br />What I most resent from the author is the absence of  a clear-cut definition of the word \\"right\\" and a dangerous relativism by which almost everything can be justified.<br /><br />PART ONE, The Origins of Rights, is mostly a confutation of other theories, the \\"natural\\", the \\"divine\\" and the \\"legal\\" sources. In their place Dershovitz proposes a \\"nurtural\\" (that is a mix of experience and culture) source, based on a kind of experimental, cultural and semi-evolutionist approach.<br /><br />In doing this he puts himself in the wider perspective of the American Pragmatism.<br /><br />Can you confute a theory (or theories) about the origins of rights without trying to define what a right is?<br /><br />Actually it is what happens here.<br /><br />The author forgets to produce an explicit definition of right. This is the main weakness in the essay, because the lack of definition ends in endangering the whole structure of the reasoning. With no clear definition, a right can be anything and nothing.<br /><br />Apparently for Dershowitz all rights are more or less similar and equal (are the right to welfare and constitutional rights the same?), since they bear the same birth by \\"nurture\\" and all are considered always open to further challenge by experience. No right is eternal.<br /><br />PART TWO,  \\"Some challenges to experience as a source of rights\\", deals more specifically with the author's proposal to use experience and culture (or \\"nurture\\" as he prefer to call it) as foundation for rights.<br /><br />PART THREE is mostly focused on specific contemporary issues: the right to life, the right of speech, animal and environmental rights and, lastly, the future of rights in an age of global terror.<br /><br />What can definition tell us about rights?<br /><br />Well, first it can tell us something about the nature of rights and the many \\"families\\" of rights.<br /><br />Not just first generation rights (constitutional rights), \\"second generation\\" (the rights to welfare) and lastly third generation (the environmental rights).<br /><br />Not just negative rights (those limiting the action of Government, usually favored by neo-cons) vs. positive rights (the rights of citizens to receive welfare from the State, usually favored by Liberals).<br /><br />But also the distinction - too often abused -between rights and duties.<br /><br />And lastly the eventual link by rights, duties and morality.<br /><br />Lacking a clear definition of right, the author resorts to a weak theory of \\"nurture\\", that is a kind of semi-evolutionary theory in which the relevant terms are experience and culture.<br /><br />The main problems of this theory are three:<br /><br />- the risk to confound philosophy and sociology, that is to find justification from history and culture and not from logic and principles (righs as a compensation for past wrongs)<br /><br />- confusion between Philosophy and Science. Philosophy, be it Logics or Morality, is totally the result of the mind. To talk about a quasi-Darwinian evolution of rights is to miss completely the point...<br /><br /> - the risk not to be able to produce a definitive and unequivocal censure to historical mayor breaking of rights (as well as of moral laws), since justification of rights ends to be in the hands of the winning party (a disaster if the winning party is the wrongdoers'). This is a relevant issue since it opens the theory to the justification of every possible mischief (Nazi laws, Serbian ethnic cleansing,...). To be honest, Dershovitz sees the risk and tries to explain why it is not so...  but sincerely I could not see any strong ground.<br /><br />He seems to justify the situation of prisoners in Guantanamo and even the last resort to torture, basing his judgment on of the specific historical situation, relevant culture and ultimate success of these policies - but under these regards Stalin's policies can be easily justified as well, because \\"necessitated\\" by the political situation and the need of new revolutionary Russia to survive (yet I guess few of the victims of Soviet terror would willingly agree with this viewpoint).<br /><br />The call for experience, even balanced by culture, ends often in the priority of means over -and sometimes to detriment to - ends: if I can fight terror efficiently by curbing rights, why not? But the role of rights is to be there as a fence to prevent easy shortcuts endangering individual guarantees.<br /><br />Personally I believe that for some rights - specially constitutional or first generation rights - justification has to be found in an absolute prohibition expressed by common morality to harm or cause pain to others in absence of adequate reason. In the light of common morality no Hitler, Stalin, Milosevic can be excused. By the same token derives the consequence that these rights have to be guarded and kept non-negotiable, because not funded on experience but on the fundamental social contract (or social language, whatever) that keeps democracy alive: in this sense these rights must be considered - even if risking to be rhetorical - \\"sacred\\".<br /><br />Every Fundamental Right that has not a strong justification - other that the accidental historical and cultural cases - can be easily forfeited as \\"un-democratic\\" or because of higher necessity.<br /><br />Some chapters result completely redundant and out of place.<br /><br />CHAPTER 12, Can rights cause injustice? Here a rather incongruous theory of the anti-democratic nature of rights is  advanced! (but are not rights the building block of every democracy? Usually we associate lack of rights and lack of democracy) Rights are always in a certain sense \\"egoistic\\" since they do not look positively at sociability, but are mostly insurances against the embedded risks of sociality)<br /><br />CHAPTER 13,  Is the debate on the external sources of rights liberal or conservative? Out of place and too bland to be really relevant and interesting.<br /><br />If you've been so patient to follow me so far and understand what I wrote, there can be a chance you share some of my interests.<br /><br />I'd like also to recommend and list other books -specifically relevant to this theme - I had the chance to read in the past about the same argument, in the hope they could be of any use:<br /><br />- Stephen Holmes & Cass R. Sunstein - \\"The cost of Rights. Why Liberty depends on Taxes\\" (1999). This is specific on this argument and is also up to now the best book I read on the subject.<br /><br />- Amitai Etzioni - \\"Communitarism\\". It deals marginally with rights, specially in the opposition of right to duties. Very interesting essay, but I could not agree with the author, whose proposal ends to be the creation of sealed communities, united by common interests.<br /><br />- Bernard Gert - \\"Morality. Its nature and Justification\\". In the second part it deals as well with rights with regard to moral laws and moral ideas. Highly interesting, but no easy read. A chapter is dedicated to the theme of Rights and Political Ideas.<br /><br />- Bernard Gert - \\"Common Morality. Deciding what to do\\" - an abridgement of the former, it can be helpful in understanding that a strong moral justification - other than experience, culture or \\"nurture\\" - for rights can be found and defended.<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.ts have to be guarded and kept non-negotiable, because not funded on experience but on the fundamental social contract (or social language, whatever) that keeps democracy alive: in this sense these rights must be considered - even if risking to be rhetorical - \\"sacred\\".  <br />Every Fundamental Right that has not a strong justification - other that the accidental historical and cultural cases - can be easily forfeited as \\"un-democratic\\" or because of higher necessity.  <br /> <br />Some chapters result completely redundant and out of place.  <br />CHAPTER 12, Can rights cause injustice?

It was already some time I wished to read this essay, both out of interest for the argument and because of the fame of Lowenstein as a very conscientious journalist.<br />I must confess I have been totally satisfied with this work and, while warmly recommending to other readers, I look forward to read some of his other books (specially the one about LTCM collapse).<br /><br />The essay is compact (just 227 pages), easily readable and extremely interesting, since the author has obviously a huge in depth knowledge of the argument and his style is extremely balanced and pleasant.<br /><br />Lowenstein shows a very impartial approach: there's no rhetoric, no overtones, no moralistic attitude (like usual themes of pride punished) but produces many hard data and clever evaluation arranged carefully to build a very powerful case.<br /><br />Because of this approach, the book is probably the best account of the 1990s bubble I have had the chance to read.<br /><br />\\"The Origins of the Crash\\" is specially a report of how the financial bubble formed and grew, to ultimately bust  at the beginning of the year 2000 in the way everyone knows.<br /><br />Lowenstein traces the origins of the troubles to come in a cultural shift that occurred in the late `80s:<br />- the impact of LBO creating pressure on CEOs, coupled with new theories as \\"shareholder value\\" and EVA;<br />- a shift from cash bonuses to stock options (and often  not only so) for CEOs and attitudes focused on hard competition, \\"creative destruction\\" (stressing more on change than stability) and easy profit, more than self-sustaining quality and long term growth;<br />- governmental deregulation (specially the repeal of  Glass-Steagall Act, benign neglect on possible conflicts of interest and  globalization of financial markets);<br />- the coming of age of the new free market economics and their easy faith in the self-correcting capacity of markets (but I would add as well theories of risk management, that gave the false belief to be able to overcome and manage financial stresses, and the distortions on stock market prices caused by the use and abuse of derivatives).<br /><br />Given the frame, disaster comes to be almost inevitable:<br />- shareholder value is narrowly interpreted and implemented as the effort to inflate stock prices (the best - and safest - manager is not the one with best result but the one with the best track record of stock prices)<br />- shareholder value, with its emphasis on prices, causes a shift form long term to short term in a hectic chase for steady  and consistent business results;<br />- deregulation opens the way to conflicting interests: in corporate governance (internal audit, CEOs, President), outside the company in the balance of mutual checks (external auditing companies offering as well professional consulting to the same customer and pretending, while so doing, to remain \\"objective\\"), repeal of Glass Steagall and dismissal of \\"Chinese walls\\" between commercial banking and financial analysis).<br /><br />To this explosive mix you just have to add a long bull market: drunken by the returns of the stock market over a 10 years span, no investor, few financial analyst and even fewer government officials complained about the many warnings of problems to come.<br /><br />In every financial bubble there is an economic side of the story, as well a psychological profile.<br /><br />The psychological side tells the usual story of all the former financial bubbles: easy faith, unwarranted optimism,  invention of new paradigms (\\"the new economy\\") and of new evaluative methods to account the unaccountable.<br />But this part is the least developed by Lowenstein, since his main interest is in exposing the fundamental problems in corporate governance, and not in describing passing (or recurring) fashions.<br />So if you search for a story about rocketing of stock market prices, followed by their rapid sinking, I fear you'll be disappointed: this book is not involved in security analysis proper or in the evaluation of the markets, and neither tries to give advice on how, where and when you should invest  your money.<br /><br />If you've been so patient and kind to follow me so far, there can be a chance you share some interest in the argument. If so, I think that these titles I had the chance to read in the past, could be of some significance to you as well:<br />- J.K.Galbraith - \\"The Great Crash 1929\\".. The official story of the great bubble of the 1920s<br />-  M.Dash - \\"Tulipomania\\". A lively story of the first recorded western financial bubble: tulips in XVII century Holland.<br />- E,Chancellor - \\"The Devil Takes the Hindmost\\" - a colorful and well-informed essay focusing specially on the XIX century.<br />- Ch.P.Kindleberger - \\"Manias, Panics and Crashes\\". Very interesting, but beware the title: it is a very specific essay on management of financial crises.<br />- Robert Shiller - \\"Irrational Exuberance\\". Possibly one of the most interesting books published in the last years: while I don't like too much behavioral finance, yet the first 50 pages are well worth many times the book price.<br />- J.A Paulos - \\"A Mathematician plays the stock market\\". Avoid this book! Too cheap and sometimes silly. Not worth the money.<br />- Burton J. Malkiel - \\"A Random Walk down Wall Street\\". Usually the first chapters of this evergreen are dedicated to financial manias.<br /><br />You are most welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br />Thanks for reading.give advice on how, where and when you should invest  your money.

US	52478625	R3P153461N0BWG	159420019X	240296592	The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin	Books	3	12	20	N	N	Entertaining, but rather average.	I bought this book for many reasons, not least because it was awarded with the Pulitzer Prize.<br />Moreover, Franklin stands in the crossroad of many interests of mine: Enlightenment (not just French, but specially English and Scottish Enlightenment), the American and the French Revolutions, the social and cultural milieu of the Ancien Regime...<br /><br />Franklin is probably one of the most interesting characters of his times (as well of all times). In the past I perused his autobiography, often finding new perspectives, and had the chance to read as well a few biographies about him:<br />- Walter Isaacson's \\"Benjamin Franklin. An American Life\\" (2003) - rather average like this one<br />- the classic Carl Van Doren's \\"Benjamin Franklin\\".<br />- H.W. Brands' \\"The First American. The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin\\" (2000) - probably the most extensive and detailed research about the argument, if not a little weak in style and at times prolix...<br />- Albert Henry Smyth's \\"Life of Benjamin Franklin\\" - old work, but probably the most lively and extensive homage to Franklin's years in Paris.<br /><br />While Isaacson and Brands in the title point to the \\"American\\" dimension of Franklin's personality, Wood  is apparently stressing the more \\"European\\" or international stature of the man, who in a certain sense had to be re-Americanized at a later time.<br />In fact, in the preface Wood tell us that \\"this book is not meant to be a traditional biography of Franklin\\"... being... \\"a relatively selective study, focusing on specific aspects of this extraordinary  man's life that reveal a Benjamin Franklin who is different from our inherited common understanding\\" (Preface - p. IX)....<br /><br />It is a pity that most of these intentions remain wishful thinking.<br />From the very beginning the reader is presented with the usual biography - \\"Franklin was born in Boston on January 1,1706...\\" (p.17) - starting with the customary analysis of the autobiography and then introducing later  life in the habitual way.<br />I found interesting the part (p.35 onward) dedicated to the meaning of the word \\"gentleman\\" in the XVIII century and its relevance in understanding Franklin's choice to retire from work at so early age.<br />Also interesting in the last chapters (pp. 230 onward) the analysis of Franklin's fame in the early years of the new republic and the hostility of Congress first and Senate later.<br /><br />On the whole this biography is well written, informative and even pleasant... but sincerely I'm rather surprised it deserved a Pulitzer Prize.<br />It produces nothing new or relevant that has not been already written in the two former works (both of them rather recent - since one published in the year 2000 and the other in 2003! - as well as more complete and deserving).<br /><br />When I spotted this book, I hoped to find a biography that finally did attempt a comprehensive analysis of Franklin's European years.<br />This period is still one of the least studied, and it is likely the one that can show a different - even more brilliant - portrait of the man.<br /><br />While in England he had an extensive net of contacts and friendships with all the most important intellectuals of the time (Hume, Adam Smith, Shaftsbury, Paine, Mandeville,...). What we still do not know is how he was able to create this net... possibly through his Masonic fraternities but also by means of his participation to clubs that at the time were mostly Whig(-ish).<br />Such analysis could be extremely interesting in corroborating the thesis that the American rebellion was firstly the result of an intestine war inside Britain: an aborted civil war between principles and power that backfired in the hands of the wining Tories. This theory (advanced by Robert Harvey in his \\"A few Bloody Noses. The American War of Independence\\") is corroborated by many clues: not least - to stay in the argument -  the friendship between Franklin and Pitt (Lord Chatam) and thesympathy Franklin enjoyed from Burke and many important Whig personalities.<br />Besides no one did note that at the beginning of the \\"Autobiography\\" Franklin seems to forecast the revolution when talking about the brutal separation from his brother (and his family) to begin a new life.<br />To study his second stay in London could be immensely interesting also in casting a glance in the cultural life of the metropolis at the peak of the Enlightenment: the many clubs, the Royal Society, the newspapers arena (specially the Gentleman's Magazine at which the doctor often contributed), Masonic lodges, ...<br />An interesting remark that Wood produces, but does not develop, is the thesis about revolution as backfire of the British nationalism that develops after the Seven Years War (a rather new thesis, that should deserve more attention, since the rise of nationalism is currently dated with the Napoleonic wars).<br /><br /> The second period that could be a mine of new discoveries (not just for Franklin, but also for Jefferson - and, in a lesser degree for Adams and Jay) is the one Franklin spent in France.<br />It is a pity that Wood treats the French culture of the time with some condescension if not open despise (an attitude induced by recent political attritions with France ?): it does not help in understanding the period.<br />Particularly annoying are some of his simplifications: \\"French aristocrats were themselves critics of their society, involved in what today we call \\"radical chic\\" (pah.174) ... \\"French excitement over the proverbs of Bonhomme Richard reveals some of what we might call the early beginning of modern French structuralism or deconstruction\\" (182) and so on... it seems that extremely annoying oversimplification we can see in films like \\"Jefferson in Paris\\".<br />Simplification is other than understanding, and Wood cannot grasp the significance of those years that were also the \\"happiest in Franklin life\\".<br />Franklin was not just an American envoy in France, but he actively participated to the cultural life of Paris: he is assiduous to the salons of mme Du Deffand, of mme Helvetius, he joins the local Masonic Lodge of the Trois Seurs, he knows all the local intellectuality (Voltaire, Condorcet, ...) as well is in contact with the brightest minds in Europe. It was him to introduce Jefferson to the political and cultural circles of the city.<br />In a way he transforms for a few years in a very different character from the one we know so well from the Autobiography and the usual biographies: no one reading the letters to mme Brillon can but feel surprise at the teasing of religious beliefs and at the many more or less explicit sexual innuendos... His Ephemera are small pieces not easily to be appreciated in mother country (in effect Woods does not mention neither one not the other)<br />Yet this culture is the one that will pass to Jefferson themes like the right of generational binding, the Declaration of the Rights of man, the need for balance of powers... and is a society in which Enlightenment is slowly fading to leave place to new pre-romantic sensibilities (Rousseau and his followers but also Mesmer, ..), precursors not of autocratic Restoration but of violent and bloody Revolution (the thesis brilliantly put forward by Simon Shama in \\"Citizen\\": the revolution as product of the early Romanticism and not of the late-Enlightenment).<br /><br />I could write for a long while, because these themes are extremely fascinating but after all this is only a review...<br /><br />To sum my impressions, this book is a rather average biography of dr.

Portrait of a Sea\\" is probably the best homage ever paid to the \\"Mare Nostrum\\": passionate, informed and attentive to the many colors of its shores. Also his \\"The Great Siege: Malta1565\\" reveals this same passion.<br /><br />Unfortunately this book is just the average list of islands arranged in roughly geographical order and enlivened here and there with a colorful touch.<br /><br />Nothing more - nothing less.<br /><br />As a traveler, I have toured extensively in the Mediterranean and enjoy as well reading about its history and traditions.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, there may be a chance you're looking at this book because of my same reasons and could be interested in similar travel-related books I had the chance to read (and enjoy) about this argument:<br /><br />- Predrag Matvejevic - \\"Mediterranean. A Cultural Landscape\\". Nostalgia over the shores of the dark wine sea (if interested, I have written a review on it).<br /><br />- Ernle Bradford - \\"Mediterranean. Portrait of a Sea\\". Possibly the best book I read on history, culture and traditions of the Mare Nostrum.<br /><br />- John Ash - \\"A Byzantine Journey\\". A poetic, fragile and luminous evocation of the Byzantine past.<br /><br />- Stephen Minta - \\"On a Voiceless Shore\\". A travel on the footsteps of lord Byron: passionate, poetic and hugely learned.<br /><br />- James G. Frazer - \\"Pausanias and Other Greek Sketches\\" (1900). Yes, this is the author of the famous \\"Golden Bough\\". It is a collection on short sketches about archeological walks and visit on mainland Greece. Today everything is changed, but you still can catch some of the fascination described in this book.<br /><br />- Patrick Leigh Fermor - \\"Mani. Travels in the Southern Peloponnese\\" (1958). Deservedly praised for his sensibility in describing a vanishing Greece, this is one of the most touching homage ever paid to Greece. The remoteness of the Mani region is nowadays gone, but still you can enjoy the unique landscape and imagine how it must be at the beginning of the XX century.<br /><br />- Robert Byron - \\"The Station. Athos: treasures and Men\\" (1928) -  by the same author of \\"The Road to Oxiana\\", it is a report of a trip to Mount Athos, written by a lover of Byzantine civilization. It cast a glance on some of the less known traits of modern Greek culture, the Byzantine heritage and the orthodox faith.<br /><br />- Henry Miller - \\"The Colossus of Maroussi\\".

US	52478625	R3MPAJQICC9X7	0333718305	474963610	A Concise History of Byzantium	Books	2	7	17	N	N	Partial and incomplete.	I bought this book because of my interest in the Byzantine culture and because, as the title suggests, it promised to be a concise summary of the Eastern Roman Empire millenary history.<br /><br />It has been a true disappointment.<br /><br />The book is written with a pleasant style and the writer is reputed to be an expert in Byzantine history, but nonetheless I couldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />There are many features I did not like.<br /><br />The most annoying (to me at least) is no doubt in the early parts of the survey: the idea - restated many times - of the Byzantine as the empire of virtue (words are mine) opposed to the depravity of the former classical civilization. This has been due - according to the author - to the moralizing and healthy effect of Christian ethics, a feature that - it is suggested - contributed to the salvation of the Eastern part of the empire. This generalization is being corroborated by highly suspicious arguments: from Plato's (dubious) condemnation of homosexuality (at pag.64 in my edition) and the (reiterated) enforcement of laws against sodomy, to the pernicious influence of the  pagan schools and the \\"modest\\" side effect of their forced  closing by Justinian, up to the idea of roman Arcadian republican virtues debased with times, but I could list many more examples...<br /><br />But if the Eastern Empire found salvation BECAUSE of his higher morality, must we believe that the western part of the Empire perished because its own lack of virtue...?<br /><br />I fear the moment we do this, even if in the right, there may be a fair chance we find ourselves beyond the boundary of History proper...<br /><br />Besides sometimes the reiteration of laws about public morality can be the spy of LACK of moral responsibility... (laws are done to cure problems)<br /><br />Meanwhile there is no global perspective of the millenarian history of the Byzantine Empire and many legitimate question are left unanswered.<br /><br />In what relevant features the Byzantine empire was different from the former Roman Empire?<br /><br />And from the Western Roman Empire?<br /><br />In what consisted the difference between the Orthodox and the \\"Catholic\\" Church? Was the schism just the result of caprice because of disagreement on unleavened bread and the word \\"filioque\\" in the Nicean Credo?<br /><br />What is the cultural dimension of the Eastern Empire? What about its cultural and political elites? The channels of transmission and diffusion of the former classical culture? And the conflict between  lay and religious cultural traditions?<br /><br />The essay is reduced to an unending gallery of emperors, some capable and others weak... and the decline of the empire inevitably is totally ascribed to the weak ones who were not able to retain and enlarge their possessions. Sometimes this method sounds similar to a modern essay on corporate governance, where the CEO is reputed to be the sole responsible for success and failures.<br /><br />No attempt has been made to set the history in the larger context of the times: Persians are just enemies, if not barbarians; Arabs just barbarians and also Turks are a mere nuisance and at last a fatal illness. But all these peoples represented sophisticated civilizations, that had relevant role both in the cultural exchange with the Byzantine Empire (the Arabs specially a decisive role in the cultural renaissance after the iconoclastic dark age) and with the medieval and early-renaissance European Culture (the Toledo translators, the Salernitan school,...)<br /><br />No attempt has been made to inquiry in the diplomatic strategic ability of the Empire, a feature credited by many other historians as the single main \\"weapon\\" that permitted the empire to survive up to the XV century.<br /><br />The list could go on for a long while.<br /><br />But it is worthless to keep on.<br /><br />If you are interested in the Byzantine history and culture, it'll be better for you  to look for other introductions.<br /><br />I can just recommend a few books I truly appreciated and I believe far more interesting:<br /><br />- Dimitry Obolensky - \\"The Byzantine Commonwealth\\"- a superb appraisal of the Byzantine diplomacy and the ensuing diffusion of the Byzantine culture in Eastern Europe. Unlike the Romans who spread their culture because of their army might, Constantinople was able to spread by virtue of ambassadors and missionaries. Great insight into the peculiarity of what we call today \\"Eastern Orthodox\\" cultures (see my review)<br /><br />- Dimitri Gutas - \\"Greek Thought and Arabic Culture\\", a very interesting story of the continuous cultural osmosis  between East and West, from the rise of the Persian Empire to the advent of Islamism (the first and second waves of translations). (see my review)<br /><br />- Jerry Brotton - \\"The Renaissance Bazaar. From the silk road to Michelangelo\\" - excellent presentation of the Renaissance culture from a wider multicultural perspective. (see my review)<br /><br />I do appreciate feedback.<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.t recommend a few books I truly appreciated and I believe far more interesting: <br />- Dimitry Obolensky - \\"The Byzantine Commonwealth\\"- a superb appraisal of the Byzantine diplomacy and the ensuing diffusion of the Byzantine culture in Eastern Europe.

US	52478625	R111KN1GTRAYEG	0385337116	520405863	The Rule of Four	Books	2	13	18	N	N	Mannerism, but not much more	I bought The Rule of Four because it was introduced as a \\"profoundly erudite\\" historical thriller on the style of the Name of The Rose.<br /><br />Well, personally I did not like the book.<br />And not because it lacks of \\"erudition\\", or because poorly written.<br />Unlike the awful \\"DaVinci Code\\", this novel is extremely well written, with a smooth style and a blend of delicate nuances that, yes, could remember of Fitzgerald and serious literature.<br />The problem is that the plot is an ill managed attempt to combine two different stories: it results in a halting pace, sometimes very slow and descriptive, sometimes quicker but still uneven.<br /><br />The first story regards the graduation year of three extremely gifted friends: the reader is introduced to college life, its rituals, attitudes and expectations. This story is intertwined with a parallel tale of the father of one of these and his two mates when they did graduated: in time they did become a college professor, an art historian and a wealthy art manager. This second story may sound as an indictment to the academic world: specially the envy, jealousy and hatred that sometimes characterize college professors. This part is well written, consistent, a bit slow in pace as well as predictable in the outcome and in the use of commonplaces.<br /><br />The second story - from which the book takes its title - tells the discovery of a secret code inside a rather marginal  and highly eccentric XVI century Latin treatise.<br />This code hides a message describing the attempt by a Roman nobleman to save some of the most invaluable heritage of the Italian Renaissance from the vanity bonfires of Savonarola. It is a legacy both ideal and factual and it ideally builds a bridge between that extraordinary period and our modern society.<br />This second part is the \\"real\\" novel and result far more interesting, nonetheless it is so tiny that results in a marginal part of the book... Actually the idea is excellent and it could have produced by itself a first rate historical thriller, but I have the impression that the authors only sketched the relevant aspects, leaving a bitter impression of superficiality.<br /><br />As for most - but not all - history thriller, you cannot ask for a total consistency, but in this case it finishes to be just a pleasant colorful tale with not so many scruples for historical precision and verisimilitude.<br />I found particularly annoying the fact that often the blend of the two stories is too visible: when in the proper \\"thriller\\" story the first murders happen, the investigation is omitted from the story - possibly not to compromise the final surprise - with great disappointment to my curiosity.  A murder by definition IS always a relevant part of thriller/police story and an average reader expects the story follow this path and not the smooth description of college life.<br /><br />Marginally I found inaccuracies, some of them particularly annoying :<br />At page 45: The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, which in Latin mean... Not Latin but mostly Greek (Hypnos = Sleep / Eros = Love / machia = from the Greek verb to wrestle)<br />At page 346: \\"In a single German monastery he finds philosophical treatises of Parmenides, Empedocles and Democritus ...\\" Totally unlikely! Most part of the surviving ancient Greek texts come from Constantinople (thanks specially to cardinal Bessarione). None - that I know - has ever been found in a German Monastery<br />At page 441: Notticelli's oil painting canvas ... Botticelli painted on wood like anyone who has been at the Uffizi palace can easily see. Oil painting on canvas has been introduced later. (Besides, is it likely that an original - formerly unknown - painting by Botticelli can be sent by normal mail ? Very unlikely).<br /><br />As I told, this novel is far better than the (extremely dull) \\"DaVinci Code\\", but still it is still far away from masterworks as \\"The Name of The Rose\\" by Umberto Eco, \\"My Name is Red\\" by OhranPamuk or \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost \\" by Iain Pears.<br /><br />I do appreciate feedback.<br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br />Thanks for reading.ate feedback.

I'm not convinced... : the structure used is mainly focused on the palace and the writer shows us each flat, in a rather haphazard - at the beginning  at least - way. Each flat has a kind of personal identity and the sum of the many identities creates a living painting of modern Turkish society.<br /><br />As it can be read under different perspective, so also appraisal of the story can be - and is - different.<br /><br />It can be a kind of expressionist social portrait: under this angle there is sometimes a flamboyant irony in a kind of almost Almodovar-ian style (specially in the description of the twins hairdressers, madam Auntie and Hygiene Tijen). In this rabelaisian portrait the garbage comes to be visually the past: the annoying smell, the fleas and cockroaches but also the new flats (present) built on the site of ancient cemeteries (past), the unending creative-destruction that takes nowhere.<br /><br />It can be a nostalgic picture of Istanbul: the many communities at the beginning of the century (the white Russians, the Armenians, the Greek and the Jews), the traditional Turkish culture endangered by modernity and a longing for a lost equilibrium. This picture has an almost mythological dimension, that recalls - yes - A thousand and one Nights, but also Ohran Pamuk (to remain in Turkey) and the Maquez of A Hundred Years of Solitude.<br />There's a tendency to idealize, to escape the grey mark of reality and to erase the mark of time and everyday misery .<br /><br />It can be also a series of - sometimes unconnected - people, each one in his peculiar identity... but this viewpoint is definitely reductive and not the most interesting.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I believe it can be worthwhile to recommend to readers interested in good literature.<br />It is very interesting and instructive<br />None the less, sometimes it lacks balance.<br />The best part is undoubtedly the first, the one in which the story of the palace is presented.<br />The central part is sometimes a bit too prolix, especially in Flat number 7 where there's almost no action but a quasi-philosophical assessment of the situation.<br />The last part is more agile, more properly the story of Madam Auntie madness and also the chapters become shorter but often the irony is cheap and sometimes a bit too underlined to be really pleasant.<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br />Thanks for reading.century (the white Russians, the Armenians, the Greek and the Jews), the traditional Turkish culture endangered by modernity and a longing for a lost equilibrium.

Books	4	10	13	N	N	Still gripping, but a little outdated	As a reader, I've always been fond of thriller, police and crime stories. They are often - undeservedly - considered a lesser genre, none the less they present an extraordinary opportunity to test logic skills, appraise different possibilities and sometimes also exercise in virtual history.<br /><br />The Quiller Memorandum is no exception.<br /><br />It has even a pedigree, as winner of the Edgar Allan Poe for Best Novel in 1966.<br /><br />Basically it is the story of a secret agent employed by the British intelligence in the '50s to track down former Nazi criminals hiding under respectable new identities, who comes to confront a dangerous German neo-Nazi secret association, the Phoenix, trying to regain power.<br /><br />Many of the situations described bring to mind \\"The Odessa File\\" by Forsythe and \\"Fatherland\\" by Robert Harris, and I guess that this novel has been an important inspiration - if not source - to both of them.<br /><br />None the less both \\"Fatherland\\" and \\"The Odessa File\\" are far more consistent and superior.<br /><br />I believe the book is a bit out of date to the modern reader and shows the marks of time: under some aspects it is a typical product of the late '60s, with its faltering hopes and gloomy expectations.<br /><br />The hero is James-Bondlike but not so successful and formidable, and neither so optimistic: unlike Bond he doesn't seem able to be able to control the outside world, while is an expert in self-control, that is psychoanalysis (there are some dull remarks about Es and Ego), mnemotechnics and psychology.<br /><br />There's pervasive pessimism in the usefulness of reason and logics and a suicide-like attitude in many of his actions (the mythological image used is the Greek tauromachia, the man who fight the bull with his bare hands) that is kind of self-destructive mysticism.<br /><br />His adversaries appear to be all-pervasive: they are ghostlike and always in advantage, but they too finish to act irrationally.<br /><br />Unlike classic thrillers, this is mostly the description of a nightmare. The scene is reduced at minimum (we know it happens in Berlin), the individuals are reduced to primeval pulsions (pure masochism in Inga, sadism in Oktober, multiple personalities in Zossen, revenge in Rothstein and so on), time can contract or expand according to the needs and logic may be faultless but of no use to forecast what will happen.<br /><br />With these cautions, the novel is still readable and can offer a few hours of interesting time off<br /><br />I hope my impressions may have been of help to you.<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.e classic thrillers, this is mostly the description of a nightmare.

US	52478625	RDEJ34YX54ANH	0195173716	700917974	Common Morality: Deciding What to Do	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Deciding what to do	This is the second work I read by Bernard Gert.<br /><br />A few years ago I had the pleasure to find his excellent \\"Morality. Its Nature and Justification\\" (a book I strongly recommend). This second small treatise is mostly an abridgement (149 pages only) of the former, but also incorporates some objections that have been moved and new contributions.<br /><br />Reading Gert is a real pleasure for the mind: not just the stringent logic and systematic proceeding you expect from a moral philosopher, but also a limpid style and an always unassuming non rhetorical tone. I'm not praising this book for easiness or for a enjoyable style, the praise goes to the result, that is a totally clear and consistent exposition.<br /><br />In a way, Gert is not the typical moral thinker. As far as I know his work, he focused on a very limited field of enquiry: common morality, that is that \\"ethica minor\\" that deals specifically with moral action and free will.<br /><br />His approach is also unusual.<br /><br />While he claims and demonstrates that moral action can find his justification on the firm foundations of stringent logic, Gert assumes that morality is a totally human convention, not a \\"social contract\\" but an implicit language, with its rules, verbs and declinations, developed by human societies to avoid causing, minimize and relieve pain.<br /><br />Common morality distinguishes between what is morally prohibited/required (moral rules) and what is morally encouraged (moral ideas). To regard a kind of action as morally prohibited/required is to favor making a person liable to punishment for any serious instance of  a failure to do/avoid that kind of action.<br /><br />Avoid causing pain is the main goal of morality: breaking the rules connected with causing pain (Do not kill - do not cause pain - do not disable - do not deprive of freedom - do not deprive of pleasure) with no valid justification, is ipso facto considered an immoral action. Then there are \\"social\\" rules (Do not deceive - keep your promises - Do not cheat - Obey the law - Do your duty) that prevent causing pain, affording dependability on the other moral agents. While for the first 5 rules the moral agent is required to follow them strictly with no praise associated, with the second we can begin to talk of virtues in following them, and vices in breaking.<br /><br />Virtues properly are the moral ideas (helping others),  concerned with relieving pain: violation of a moral idea is not liable to punishment, but only of censure and disapproval.<br /><br />Gert focuses almost totally on the moral rules, analising them and also the procedures to justify their violation.<br /><br />Compared to his former work, this one is more coherent and simple, and arranged in a consistent and deductive way. In a way this essay could be equated to an Euclidean treatise: we have a system of absolutely general rules and in a deductive way we can easily evaluate every moral/immoral action.<br /><br />This is by far the best book on common morality I had the chance to read. None the less it seems to me there can be problems at least under two different aspects.<br /><br />The first is connected with moral ideas.<br /><br />While for vices we have a degree of judgment (abstension/ justification), here we have nothing but an indistinct praise. To help others is fine, but is a too general rule: is giving charities always good, also when there is no control on how money is employed? Should there be a degree of responsibility in helping others? What is best: giving food to the hungry, or helping him grow food? And what about emergencies?<br /><br />If we do not have a degree of responsibility in helping others, we will create only addiction,  in the long term also indifference and pain will just be postponed but not avoided.<br /><br />Possibly I guess Gert did not develop this theme for fear to fall in an utilitarian trap... but some degree of control must be considered not just for praising but also evaluating efficacy.<br /><br />The second is a strange lack. I remember that in the first treatise he observed somewhere that moral action is always concerned with the here and now: it is not concerned with what happened in the past, but only with what could happen if...<br /><br />This is very consistent with the first five rules, but what with the \\"social rules\\"? What should we do with nasty enemies? What with immoral laws? Gert tries to deal with these arguments, but the result is that when tested in a critical environment (say the laws condemning Socrates to death, the Nazi laws, forgiving for concentration camp survivors, conscience objection and its limits) the building trembles visibly.<br /><br />The same limits are also implied - in a less critical manner - in the theory of the nature of morality as implicit language: one of the two steps procedure for justifying violations is \\"estimating the consequences of everyone knowing that a kind of violation is allowed\\"...<br /><br />If morality is a common language, we can believe that in specific environments actions considered immoral could find \\"common\\" justification: racial laws, ethnic cleansing... not to talk of the controversial abortion laws (in which a moral agent can accept, claim for conscience objection if she's a doctor or oppose, sometimes by acting likewise immorally).<br /><br />If you've been so patient and kind to follow me so far, there can be a chance you share some of my interests.<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.ing efficacy.  <br /> <br />The second is a strange lack.

US	52478625	R356PL4KJL856A	1859846157	853464937	Latin: Or the Empire of a Sign	Books	5	10	12	N	N	The European Sign	As the XVIII century advanced, the Latin language tended increasingly to decline in favour of the French, which reigned for the whole XIX century, before itself meeting competition from English.<br /><br />In a sense it was the end of an era, a long late summer appropriately marked by the French revolution, the Napoleonic wars and the ensuing spreading of nationalisms. The \\"death\\" of Latin was more a kind of slow fading away: while it was increasingly superseded by French in the Republic of Letters and in the international diplomacy, it knew his last melancholy bright days with the philological studies in the German universities and the creation of Gymnasium: dissected, revered and enshrined it was no more than the cadaver of that great sovereign who ruled the European continent for so many centuries.<br /><br />Universal language par excellence, Latin never ceased to be used in Europe even after the fall of the Roman Empire and the spreading of the new national languages. But in the meanwhile its use had changed substantially: from everyday language, increasingly to universal language in the double role of \\"sacred\\" language (for liturgy and Scriptures) and language of power and diplomacy. Then with Renaissance it finds a new role as language of culture: it is a second spring, because it becomes the supranational official language of the humanism first, and then of the so called Republic of Letters. Decline is only slowed none the less. Parallel to these roles, others are less obvious: aristocratic language, with its power of exclusion, the power to \\"say and conceal\\" and its obvious immediate uselessness that can become a mark of distinction for a proto-leisure class (Veblen).<br /><br />\\"Latin or the Empire of a Sign. From the XVI to the XX century\\" is an outstanding essay on the evolution and role of this language in the European culture.<br />Well written, in a lively and colloquial style, sprinkled with examples, citations and anecdotes, it successfully captures the attention of the reader.<br />Certainly, the theme is very specific and targeted to an readership interested in the development of European culture and in Greco-Latin philology, none the less the writer has been able to arrange a \\"reader-friendly\\" text: all Latin citations are translated,  every theme is carefully expressed in a way that also uninitiated can fully understand.<br /><br />I found this book almost by chance: a few years ago had read a very flattering review of it, but as often happens, I forgot and reading did not follow. This is a study that springs from a former essay written by Francoise Waquet with Hans Bots: \\"La R&eacute;publique des Lettres\\" (unfortunately still not translated into English), of which Latin was the common jargon.<br /><br />So why Latin could be such an alluring theme?<br />Well, because it was a common primeval language, a common mark in the identity of a culture before the Babel-like fragmentation of the Romantic period.<br />By looking at the story of the decadence of Latin, the development of the Continental culture can be understood more clearly: the decision of Louis XIV to favor a national literary language and the French great literary blooming (the age of Racine, Moli&egrave;re, Pascal,...) that precede the spread of French as common language of the European Enlightenment, the rise of bourgeoisie and the French Revolution, up to Vatican II Council in the XX century. But still in the XVII century Spinoza, by family and culture Ladino and Dutch-speaking , had to learn Latin to compose his treaties - and we can guess he did speak and write Latin with the Great Cond&eacute;, with Leibniz and Oldenburg.<br />So first sacred language of religion and priesthood, then universal language for the Renaissance savants, diplomatic jargon in the European court and common idiom of the European cultural space, increasingly threatened by new national ambitions: the French decision to use national language for diplomatic treaties (tomark the national grandeur) and the development of true national cultures favored by the rise of a new middle class.<br /><br />Mme Waquet is neutral in presenting the argument: she is neither against Latin nor nostalgic of the Latin golden age: she carefully gives voice to all parties in a well balanced and very convincing portrait. Most of the chapters actually deal with the pedagogic means used to learn Latin, and the contrabanded \\"virtues\\" of the fluency in that language.<br />Nevertheless sometimes the books presents passages of a great evocative force: the title in the first place with its suggestive \\"Empire of a Sign\\", the chapters dealing with the French Restoration (the \\"signe Europ&eacute;en\\" of Joseph the Maistre, Chateaubriand,...) up to scattered citations. One especially got my attention, and truly deserves to be fully cited:<br /><br />\\"The writer Marie Noel, who regarded herself as \\"ignorant\\" (\\"I know no more Latin than my mother, my grandmother and their servants\\"), gives an admirable description of this experience which was certainly not hers alone: «The words, many times repeated, of Veni Creator, Miserere, De Profundis, Magnificat, Te Deum and all the others had become within us our family treasure». Her \\"Notes intimes\\" give a clear impression of what it was like to have contact with a language that - apart from everything else - was neither read nor-spoken, but sung, and that was therefore inseparable from its musical coating: «The little girl of Auxerre will begin ... on hearing Christmas carols, the moving monody of the Stabat, . . . to become aware of the power of words». Words, moreover, that resounded in the nave of a cathedral whose rich decor accentuated the impression they made.<br />«I had just turned nine, my grandmother took me with her. For me it the entrance to a sublime world, outside the other one, a world in which god and men exchanged unprecedented words that had no meaning in other countries. On the evening of All Saints' Day, at six o'clock, the two of us made our way into the great Night of the Cathedral which at that hour, under its prodigious vaults, had neither beginning nor end... In the tower the knell tolled... that admirable knell of Auxerre Cathedral, a tragic group of deep bells that burst suddenly into sobbing - five or six heartbreaking notes - and then fell back into silence from which, after a few minutes of anguish, they would break out once more in sombre tears drawn from some unknowable well of suffering and fear... Nevertheless, we sang along with the priests! »\\" (pag.102)<br /><br />I did read this book because of my passion for the history of the European culture and also because of my old studies in Greco-Latin philology.<br />This book is unique in his genre, and while I strongly recommend it, it is not easy to suggest other books on the same theme. Nonetheless, I think that these titles could be excellent associates:<br />- \\"The Republic of Letters. A cultural History of the French Enlightenment\\" by Dena Goodman. Very interesting and well written, but uneven in the result, and sometimes with a too marked militant feminist approach (yet the author doesn't seem to appreciate the fact that Enlightenment was the first period in which women had a true relevant cultural role).<br />- \\"The Age of Conversation\\" by Benedetta Craveri - a must read for sure! Gripping like a novel and hugely learned, this is the story of the development of that culture of bonne manieres, intelligent conversation, informal culture and tact that we now tend to associate with Enlightenment and the last years of the Ancien Regime.<br />- \\"The Renaissance Bazaar. From the silk road to Michelangelo\\" by Jerry Brotton.

US	52478625	RJHILM6J328BZ	1859844022	350704984	Latin: Or The Empire of the Sign	Books	5	16	16	N	N	The European Sign	As the XVIII century advanced, the Latin language tended increasingly to decline in favour of the French, which reigned for the whole XIX century, before itself meeting competition from English.<br /><br />In a sense it was the end of an era, a long late summer appropriately marked by the French revolution, the Napoleonic wars and the ensuing spreading of nationalisms. The \\"death\\" of Latin was more a kind of slow fading away: while it was increasingly superseded by French in the Republic of Letters and in the international diplomacy, it knew his last melancholy bright days with the philological studies in the German universities and the creation of Gymnasium: dissected, revered and enshrined it was no more than the cadaver of that great sovereign who ruled the European continent for so many centuries.<br /><br />Universal language par excellence, Latin never ceased to be used in Europe even after the fall of the Roman Empire and the spreading of the new national languages. But in the meanwhile its use had changed substantially: from everyday language, increasingly to universal language in the double role of \\"sacred\\" language (for liturgy and Scriptures) and language of power and diplomacy. Then with Renaissance it finds a new role as language of culture: it is a second spring, because it becomes the supranational official language of the humanism first, and then of the so called Republic of Letters. Decline is only slowed none the less. Parallel to these roles, others are less obvious: aristocratic language, with its power of exclusion, the power to \\"say and conceal\\" and its obvious immediate uselessness that can become a mark of distinction for a proto-leisure class (Veblen).<br /><br />\\"Latin or the Empire of a Sign. From the XVI to the XX century\\" is an outstanding essay on the evolution and role of this language in the European culture.<br />Well written, in a lively and colloquial style, sprinkled with examples, citations and anecdotes, it successfully captures the attention of the reader.<br />Certainly, the theme is very specific and targeted to an readership interested in the development of European culture and in Greco-Latin philology, none the less the writer has been able to arrange a \\"reader-friendly\\" text: all Latin citations are translated,  every theme is carefully expressed in a way that also uninitiated can fully understand.<br /><br />I found this book almost by chance: a few years ago had read a very flattering review of it, but as often happens, I forgot and reading did not follow. This is a study that springs from a former essay written by Francoise Waquet with Hans Bots: \\"La R&eacute;publique des Lettres\\" (unfortunately still not translated into English), of which Latin was the common jargon.<br /><br />So why Latin could be such an alluring theme?<br />Well, because it was a common primeval language, a common mark in the identity of a culture before the Babel-like fragmentation of the Romantic period.<br />By looking at the story of the decadence of Latin, the development of the Continental culture can be understood more clearly: the decision of Louis XIV to favor a national literary language and the French great literary blooming (the age of Racine, Moli&egrave;re, Pascal,...) that precede the spread of French as common language of the European Enlightenment, the rise of bourgeoisie and the French Revolution, up to Vatican II Council in the XX century. But still in the XVII century Spinoza, by family and culture Ladino and Dutch-speaking , had to learn Latin to compose his treaties - and we can guess he did speak and write Latin with the Great Cond&eacute;, with Leibniz and Oldenburg.<br />So first sacred language of religion and priesthood, then universal language for the Renaissance savants, diplomatic jargon in the European court and common idiom of the European cultural space, increasingly threatened by new national ambitions: the French decision to use national language for diplomatic treaties (tomark the national grandeur) and the development of true national cultures favored by the rise of a new middle class.<br /><br />Mme Waquet is neutral in presenting the argument: she is neither against Latin nor nostalgic of the Latin golden age: she carefully gives voice to all parties in a well balanced and very convincing portrait. Most of the chapters actually deal with the pedagogic means used to learn Latin, and the contrabanded \\"virtues\\" of the fluency in that language.<br />Nevertheless sometimes the books presents passages of a great evocative force: the title in the first place with its suggestive \\"Empire of a Sign\\", the chapters dealing with the French Restoration (the \\"signe Europ&eacute;en\\" of Joseph the Maistre, Chateaubriand,...) up to scattered citations. One especially got my attention, and truly deserves to be fully cited:<br /><br />\\"The writer Marie Noel, who regarded herself as \\"ignorant\\" (\\"I know no more Latin than my mother, my grandmother and their servants\\"), gives an admirable description of this experience which was certainly not hers alone: «The words, many times repeated, of Veni Creator, Miserere, De Profundis, Magnificat, Te Deum and all the others had become within us our family treasure». Her \\"Notes intimes\\" give a clear impression of what it was like to have contact with a language that - apart from everything else - was neither read nor-spoken, but sung, and that was therefore inseparable from its musical coating: «The little girl of Auxerre will begin ... on hearing Christmas carols, the moving monody of the Stabat, . . . to become aware of the power of words». Words, moreover, that resounded in the nave of a cathedral whose rich decor accentuated the impression they made.<br />«I had just turned nine, my grandmother took me with her. For me it the entrance to a sublime world, outside the other one, a world in which god and men exchanged unprecedented words that had no meaning in other countries. On the evening of All Saints' Day, at six o'clock, the two of us made our way into the great Night of the Cathedral which at that hour, under its prodigious vaults, had neither beginning nor end... In the tower the knell tolled... that admirable knell of Auxerre Cathedral, a tragic group of deep bells that burst suddenly into sobbing - five or six heartbreaking notes - and then fell back into silence from which, after a few minutes of anguish, they would break out once more in sombre tears drawn from some unknowable well of suffering and fear... Nevertheless, we sang along with the priests! »\\" (pag.102)<br /><br />I did read this book because of my passion for the history of the European culture and also because of my old studies in Greco-Latin philology.<br />This book is unique in his genre, and while I strongly recommend it, it is not easy to suggest other books on the same theme.

US	52478625	R2BPCWFQ6X34P4	1585675547	581629873	The Lost Messiah	Books	5	15	17	N	N	The reverse of the medal	The crucial year is Anno Domini 1666 - Hegira 1067.<br /><br />In that year \\"Jews in various part of the Middle East and Europe were taken by a messianic frenzy... began selling their goods... preparing for their joint return to the Holy Land\\".<br /><br />A hectic exchange of letters span the Mediterranean, but also the New world is interested: in far away Brazil Portuguese Marranos talk about unfolding events, in Boston the sermons of reverend Cotton Mother wonder about the coming  end of the Diaspora.<br /><br />A sense that something important is going to happen grips the entire world. For a few months time seems to stop.<br /><br />Oldenburg, the secretary of the British Royal Academy writes inquisitively to Spinoza, the ten lost tribes of Israel are reported to have put Mecca under siege, the anointed Messiah is coming to restore the Jewish nation to the promised land and will humble the infidel enemy.<br /><br />The world upside down.<br /><br />But the climax comes to a strange result: Sabbatai Sevi, the self appointed messiah, is forced by the Turkish authorities to abjure the Jewish faith and become a Muslim.<br /><br />In a sense this is the turning point but not the end of the story, like one could be easily led to think: a definite change none the less. Because most of his followers kept their faith remaining in the Jewish religion (the still existing Sabbatian Jews), some joined him in the apostasy (the still existing Muslim Domne community), some of them, still  faithful to his message, joined the Catholic Church (Yes! The picturesque Frankist community).<br /><br />In the tumultuous unfolding of events we are guided by John Freely to the discovery of a vanished world: the many Jewish communities (Romaniotes, Sephardis,  Askenazi, Karaites, Mustaribs,...) and the many cradles of the Diaspora (multinational Salonika, Alexandria, Cairo, Izmir, Istanbul, but also far away places like Amsterdam, Ferrara in Italy and the too many communities in Central Europe).<br /><br />In a sense, this book can be read as well as a travel book: to search the material, Freely followed physically the footsteps of the Sabbatians and his effort to unearth that world is in itself a real pleasure.<br /><br />Most of that world has gone, wiped by two world wars and by the mad specter of nationalism: the great Jewish communities of Greece are no more, gone the royal palace in Edirne, gone the Jewish quarter in Salonika, gone the Jewish quarters of Alexandria and Cairo, but sometimes a place has been able to defy time: Berat in Albania (truly gripping the description of the city), but also the valley of Nightingales in Istanbul.<br /><br />A vanished world: a multinational empire where Greeks  and Jews, Turks, Armenian and Arabs coexisted. A world that was apparently much more culturally global than our own and with an area that spanned from the new world to far away cities on the edge of India. A world in which many languages coexisted: the official Turkish and the semiofficial Greek, the multinational Ladino, Arabic and Yiddish...(it is curious that Sevi was not fluent in Turkish, notwithstanding his being born and lived most of his life in Izmir).<br /><br />The story is framed and intersected by the relevant historic events of the time: the fall of Venetian Candia (Crete) to the Turks, the Chminielnicki massacres in Poland and Ukraine in 1648 (one of the first great scale pogroms), the birth of the first ghetto in Venice (\\"ghetto\\" is a Venetian word), the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492), up to the failed siege of Vienna that marks the beginning of the decline of the Turkish Empire.<br /><br />I resolved to read this book after I first read about Sabbatai Sevi in the biography of Spinoza (Spinoza. A Life by Stephen Nadler). Many feature stimulated my interest, not the least the strange phenomenon of an unusual revivalist movement  in the Jewish Religion, the fact that Freely is also author of respected travel books about Greece and Turkey, my passion for the Mediterranean heritage.<br /><br />Possibly this book is a perfect blend of history, geography and religion. I enjoyed every page of it and cannot but recommend it.<br /><br />I loved this book, and yet there are parts of it that are true cameos. Between the many, this anecdote of the late 50s is sure worth to be cited in full:<br /><br />\\"While in the station in Edirne, Abraham Galant&eacute; (one of the leading authorities in the history of Turkish Jewry) waited for a train to take him back to Istanbul, he noticed an old woman who was sweeping up in the waiting room, and singing while she worked. When she came closer he could hear that she was singing in Ladino, and then to his astonish¬ment he realized that the song was one that the Donme sang together to keep up their hopes in the long centuries of waiting for Sabbatai Sevi to return:<br /><br />Oh, my beloved's gone from me, God's chosen one, Sabbatai Sevi. Though fallen low and suffering smart, Yet he is closest to my heart. . .<br /><br />Galant&eacute; questioned the woman, and learned that she was in fact a Donme - one of the very few who still remained in Edirne. He asked why she was cleaning up in the waiting room, and she explained that she did this every day to make sure that it would be spotless when Sabbatai arrived. The Messiah had gone to his rest in Albania she explained, and when he returned he would surely come by train, picking up his faithful followers on the way to Istanbul from where they would set sail for Jerusalem. She was waiting to join him, she said, and then excused herself to get on with her work, continuing her interrupted song.\\"<br /><br />(pag.241-242).<br /><br />Three hundred years had elapsed but still someone was keeping the faith.<br /><br />If you've been so patient and kind to follow me so far, there can be a chance you share some of my passions and could be interested in other books I had the opportunity to read in the past about similar arguments:<br /><br />Most specifically historical:<br /><br />- Steven Nadler - \\"Spinoza. A Life\\" , more a survey of the age and times in which Spinoza lived than a specific biography of the great philosopher (see also my review)<br /><br />- Dimitry Obolensky - \\"The Byzantine Commonwealth\\" an informed survey of the Byzantine legacy in Eastern Europe (see also my review)<br /><br />More travel-related:<br /><br />- Predrag Matvejevic - \\"Mediterranean. A Cultural Landscape\\". Nostalgia over the shores of the dark wine sea (see also my review).<br /><br />- Ernle Bradford - \\"Mediterranean. Portrait of a Sea\\". Possibly the best book I read on history, culture and traditions of the Mare Nostrum.<br /><br />- John Ash - \\"A Byzantine Journey\\". A poetic, fragile and luminous evocation of the Byzantine past.<br /><br />-  Ohran Pamuk - \\"My Name is Red\\" a fabulous novel (a must read for sure) that uses Bellini's portrait of Mehmet the Conqueror  to illustrate the clash between the artistic tradition of  the West (art like mirror of an ideal reality) and the Eastern tradition (art like symbol and not representation) - (see also my review).<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.for the Mediterranean heritage.  <br /> <br />Possibly this book is a perfect blend of history, geography and religion.

US	52478625	RO58BB4ZV7G93	0375701710	672142264	The New Life	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	One of the best contemporary writers	Some time ago - almost casually - I had the lucky chance to read \\"My Name is Red\\", one of the best novel of these last years. So it was almost natural to continue in my exploration of Ohran Pamuk's imaginary universe.<br /><br />This book, again, is equal to his fame.<br /><br />Pamuk is a great, possibly one of the most interesting contemporary writers and this novel is but a new proof of his storytelling ability and of his writing craftsmanship.<br /><br />Compared to \\"My Name is Red\\" this work is more complex, with a \\"post-modern\\" character because of the style and also of a certain pace of narration and peculiar sensibility.<br /><br />It is a story of a fascination with a book (the beginning reads \\"I read a book one day and my complete life has changed\\") that transfigures the life of the hero and compels him to leave family, abandon studies and travel endlessly though an enchanted Turkey. This book becomes a drug, a new faith, the promise of a new existential plenitude, not transient, non \\"plastic\\" and non frail as everyday modern life.<br /><br />A delicate love story, encounters with an assorted humanity (the right wing boss, the compassionate conservative, fellow readers addicted to the same book, shady secret agents,...), a landscape transformed by a visual sensibility led to the extreme, and the inescapable tragedy at the end (a true tragedy?)...<br /><br />What I enjoyed most is the pace of the book: a symphony, with endless variations on the theme, sometimes with almost hypnotic result.<br /><br />But under the serene surface, as most the books of Ohran Pamuk, the novel reveals a work of incredible craftsmanship, in which you can see both the gifted writer and the curiosity of a voracious reader.<br /><br />There are specially two dimensions - not directly related to the story  that can be read also in the literal sense - in which you can interpret the story differently: the all pervading symbolism and the meta-literary or hyper-literary level.<br /><br />The novel is pervaded, deeply permeated by symbolism, but as a non Turkish reader, I guess that some of it inevitably escaped me.<br /><br />Beginning with names, everything reminds of this different level: Doctor Fine, New Life Caramels, Memory Lane Restaurant, Bliss pills, the names of the spies (Omega, Zenith, Serkisof, Seiko - all from watches), up to the name of the beloved Janan,...<br /><br />I guess the story can easily be read as well as a kind of modern Turkish \\"Pilgrim Progress\\": the search for a paradise lost and a document of the bleeding wound of modernity, the frustration at the \\"Great Conspiracy\\" of the West to the traditional values (a theme developed by Pamuk also in other novels). Compared to \\"My Name is Red\\", symbolism in \\"The New Life\\" is much more visible, and is also one of the reasons because the psychological analysis of characters here is less developed.<br /><br />The meta-literary dimension is better perceivable to the non Turkish reader because of the international breadth: the specially strong influence of Borges (the theme of the fascination with books, the deeply felt, skeptic search for a meaning, a kind of ecstatic contemplation, a serene agnosticism), but also of Peter Hoeg (especially the one of \\"The History of Danish Dreams\\", one of the best novels of the last decade, with its dreamy warping of the time dimension). But the book is permeated as well by a specific visual sensibility of the early `90s: for the cinema specially the baroque and acid images of Derek Jarman and those emotionally charged of Tornatore (the fascination with kissing scenes in \\"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\\",...).<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.ovel is pervaded, deeply permeated by symbolism, but as a non Turkish reader, I guess that some of it inevitably escaped me.  <br />Beginning with names, everything reminds of this different level: Doctor Fine, New Life Caramels, Memory Lane Restaurant, Bliss pills, the names of the spies (Omega, Zenith, Serkisof, Seiko - all from watches), up to the name of the beloved Janan,...  <br />I guess the story can easily be read as well as a kind of modern Turkish \\"Pilgrim Progress\\": the search for a paradise lost and a document of the bleeding wound of modernity, the frustration at the \\"Great Conspiracy\\" of the West to the traditional values (a theme developed by Pamuk also in other novels).

By describing the first official salute to the United States of America fired by the Dutch port of St.Eustatius in the west Indies in 1776, Mrs. Tuchman stresses the importance of smuggling in sustaining the first phases of the conflict, the role and importance of an American naval force and, in the end, the decisive weight of French naval supremacy in the siege of Yorktown.<br /><br />A certain weakness can be perceived in the unevenness  and disproportion in treating the matter at hands (the Dutch Rebellion takes about 3 chapters, the Seven Years War about 2, two chapters are dedicated to the creation of the Us navy, one to the biography of Admiral Rodney, while the last four chapters are a rather average description of the last stages of the war).<br /><br />Actually what I liked most was the new fascinating perspective you can command from this approach.<br />By analyzing the similarities with the Dutch Rebellion (a remark shared with Benjamin Franklin), she can reconsider the American war in a full European context: not just a debate on \\"philosophical\\" principles (taxation and representation, freedom of conscience, free trade), but also  a byproduct of the new precarious balance followed to the Seven Years War (the waning of French treat in Canada, the mortification and wish of revenge of the French monarchy), and the mark of the underground conflict in England between conservative Tories and progressive Whigs (implicit in England, made explicit in the Colonies), that would in the end turn back on the continent and  initiate the age of democratic revolution in Europe.<br /><br />So was the American a true Revolution?<br />Probably not. Better to be described as the American Rebellion, its successful outcome was decisive in spreading the great hopes of change nurtured by the European Enlightenment, but in the end - like the Dutch  - it contented with the reaffirmation of offended rights never proposing officially a brave new man like the French, Russian and Chinese Revolutions.<br /><br />Very interesting is also the glance cast on the parallel history of the two rebellions: the likeness of William the Silent with Washington, the nature of defensive war, the uneven weight of the forces (both Dutch and Colonies were forced to fight against the strongest superpower of their age), the intestine war (Flanders vs. Holland, American Tories vs. Rebels), the resemblance of the Dutch Act of Rejection and the Declaration of Independence, the actual outcome in the model of  federal government.<br /><br />As a reader, I'm more interested in the political debate than in the actual story of the American Revolution. If you kept reading up to here, maybe you can be interested in other essays directly related to the argument, I had the chance to read in the past:<br />- \\"The Long Affair : Thomas Jefferson and the French Revolution, 1785-1800\\" by Conor Cruise O'Brien, by far one of the best books on Jefferson (see review) -<br />- \\"A few Bloody Noses - The American War of Independence\\" by Robert Harvey (columnist, editor and former British MP ), an appraisal of the war from an all British point of view.

In a newsstand the photo of a dangerous Soviet Ceka secret agent reported to be visiting Berlin with a Russian Delegation. A successful middle aged Jewish writer who believe to recognize in that image a former acquaintance of the times before the war.<br /><br />A sour impression that his life has been acted by someone else (this man?) and the attempt to cast light in a series of crimes happened just before the declaration of war.<br /><br />It is on the wings of these impressions we are invited in one of the most accomplished novels of these last years.<br /><br />A novel in the most classical and talented meaning of the word: an excellent piece of work, in a style remembering of  Tolstoy and Joseph Roth, James and Zola, with a perfect blend of realism and surrealism.<br /><br />The Count Governor of a remote provincial city on the remotest edges of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (\\"on the edge of the unending Asian steppes\\"), a Jewish intellectual chief of his secret police, a dying Jewish multimillionaire and his rebel son, the young cadets of the landed aristocracy, a Jewish rabbi and his murderous community, the obscure all-pervading presence of anti-Semitism, a series of murders, a revolutionary plot, a bloodbath.<br /><br />This is a book I read with blissful pleasure, because of its ability to recreate a world, give substance to a imaginary geography, paint attitudes and character - but also for the subtle pervasive warping effect of memory, a light surreal mirror that blend of Kafka, Buzzati, Roth and sometimes freezes in the sharp gray-black images of Grosz, sometimes searches oblivion in the morbid light of an ancient black and with daguerreotype,<br /><br />The true pleasure of the book doesn't come from the force of the story and the descriptive ability of the writer,  but by the contemplation of the human destiny, an all-pervading sadness but also a metaphysical  pessimism in the possibility of human action. The Count governor obsessed by self preservation, the chief of the secret police by the meaning of Evil and Good, the Jewish rabbi fascinated by murder as confrontation with God, the young revolutionaries looking for an act of total auto-affirmation (revolutionary justice like they call it), the multimillionaire seemingly the only one to be master of his destiny, but the destiny of a dying man despairing of his only son.<br /><br />I cannot but warmly recommend this novel, with a single warning: this is not an easy book. Its main virtues rest on description and the blend of old European intellectualism, sometimes to detriment of action: so if you look for a easy to read spy or crime story, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.self preservation, the chief of the secret police by the meaning of Evil and Good, the Jewish rabbi fascinated by murder as confrontation with God, the young revolutionaries looking for an act of total auto-affirmation (revolutionary justice like they call it), the multimillionaire seemingly the only one to be master of his destiny, but the destiny of a dying man despairing of his only son.  <br /> <br />I cannot but warmly recommend this novel, with a single warning: this is not an easy book.

Panjack), \\"poor structure\\" and \\"poor content\\" (J. de Lijster - \\"patchy historical survey\\" - Fiske), excessive focusing (\\"Beginners will find this a difficult book to work through\\" - Panjack), abuse of modern perspective to judge (and not to present in a impartial way) very different attitudes (\\"He frequently announces arguments that he does not work out, and he sets out lines that end in the mist\\" - J. de Lijster) and in the end excessive brevity (\\"He tries to cover too much ground too quickly\\" - Fiske) resulting in approximation and confusion.<br />Given these remarks, it is amazing the average vote is still so high, even taking account of the fame and respect that professor MacIntyre can command by the fame of his other works.<br />*<br />This essay is flawed under all the aspects under which you can look at.<br />*<br />If the style is gray and dull, and certainly not welcoming the reader, the argument has been developed very poorly.<br />I'm still perplexed at how could professor MacIntyre truly believed to be able to reduce about 3.000 years of history of Ethics in about 250 pages!<br />*<br />The most annoying feature is the deceptiveness of the title: the historical and sociological framework is used only when it suits the author, and in a most conventional way.<br />After being presented with a very ordinary opposition between an Homeric aristocratic attitude and the new more \\"democratic\\" posture of the V century b.C, the method is almost totally dropped to return to a dull diachronic presentation of great philosophers (great philosophers and not, alas, relevant themes).<br />*<br />For an introduction to the history of Ethics, as a reader I'd expect to receive at least a definition of the relevant terms: religion, morality, positive morality, negative morality, ethos, ethics, politics and ethics.<br />But Mr. MacIntyre possibly believes that definition is a waste of time in a historical survey with ensuing confusion.<br />*<br />If definition is not produced, likewise no attempt is done to explain why Ethics  emerged for the first time in Greece as a distinct field of philosophical enquiry.<br />*<br />We are spared as well the - historically relevant - analysis of the relationship (and conflict) between religion (Abraham who is required by his God to kill his only son with no apparent reason), aristocratic ethos (the role of feud and honor), negative morality (\\"You shall not...\\" in the Bible), positive morality (\\"Love thy neighbor\\" in the Gospel), politics as a kind of ethics (Plato and Aristotle, but also Socrates who submits to the unjust law that put him to death), political justice vs. religion in relevant moral issues (a theme developed in the Greek classical tragedy - specially in the Oresteia, but also in the Oedipus), the individual and social dimension in ethics (look at the debate on death penalty, for example - or the second amendment of the Constitution), the role of free will (the debate inside Christianity) and the role of man as moral agent and of man as man capable of deciding to act rightly - or to rebel authority.<br />*<br />All these themes are best suited to be expounded with an historical perspective.<br />But in this essay you cannot find anything of this.<br />I finished reading the book with immense melancholy for what it could have been and is not.<br />*<br />Besides, in a academic survey it could be interesting if the author could have taken account of relationship between ethics and other fields: the role of ancient skepticism in the rise of a new conscienze (and interestingly in the new science), Ethics and Logics, but also lesser known fields, like Mathematics and Geometry - the fascination for the geometric method in XVII Century (Hobbes reading Euclid, Spinoza's \\"Ethica more geometrico demonstrata\\", Leibniz's moral calculus, up to Franklin's aborted \\"Art of Virtue\\").<br />*<br />Some remarks of the writer appear surprising - if not ridiculous.<br />The so called notion of the \\"mean\\" in Aristotle was in fact a deep rooted theme in Greek culture and religiosity - and not just \\"the single most difficult concept in the Ethics\\" (pag.65).<br />*<br />In the end this book is a complete bore.<br />It could give testimony of the all-human attempt to investigate on the themes of how to live a meaningful life, how to act responsibly and in the end learn how to confront the idea of death. Ethics, after all, is also the Promethean attempt of man to disenfranchise from oracles, soothsayers and miracles; to reconsider human action in a pervasive all-human logical framework, and, in the end, to vindicate the importance of human dignity.<br />But this book is a patchy collection of second hand ideas, scattered here and there in the usual chronological order.<br />*<br />I prefer posting positive remarks, but in this case it would not be fair to other fellow readers.<br />*<br />I'm used to recommend books I appreciated about the argument I'm reviewing.<br />In this case it is compulsory to mention:<br />- \\"Morality\\" by Bernard Gert, that is until now the best introduction to the argument I had the chance to read.<br />*<br />You are truly welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br />*<br />Thanks for reading.of ancient skepticism in the rise of a new conscienze (and interestingly in the new science), Ethics and Logics, but also lesser known fields, like Mathematics and Geometry - the fascination for the geometric method in XVII Century (Hobbes reading Euclid, Spinoza's \\"Ethica more geometrico demonstrata\\", Leibniz's moral calculus, up to Franklin's aborted \\"Art of Virtue\\").  *  Some remarks of the writer appear surprising - if not ridiculous.

Between XIV and XVI century a silent revolution changed the landscape of Europe in such a way that nothing after Renaissance looked as before: every field showed the mark of its passage.<br />Today we still praise the age of  Salutati, Petrarca, Boccaccio, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Pico della Mirandola, Erasmus, Montaigne, Copernicus and Galileo, Bacon and Shakespeare. Just to name few of the leading figures.<br />Europe, for a brief period and for the last time, was able to regain a common universal language and Latin appeared to recover its universal supremacy over all the other languages.<br />In no period before Enlightenment we observe so many discoveries, a so grand progress in almost every field.<br /><br />Traditionally this revolution has been described as a only-European achievement.<br />Mr. Brotton with this excellent study is trying to question this euro-centric thesis and show the - many - points of contact between European Renaissance and those other cultures in the east (Arab, Turkish, Chinese and Indian) - and in the west (the newly discovered native Americans) - that came in contact with it.<br />The result is fascinating, specially in the many suggestions and in the looming new portrait of the era.<br /><br />So far, this is the best introduction I have had the chance to read to the argument. And most praiseworthy is the ability to combine all this material into about 200 pages, with a style clear, readable, full of examples and always interesting.<br /><br />The inquiry can be roughly reduced to three questions:<br />-  was Renaissance the last stage of a slow evolution or a ground-breaking revolution?<br />-  was Renaissance a only-European phenomenon?<br />- if Renaissance was not confined to the European \\"enclave\\", why other cultures were not able to benefit from it?<br /><br />Espousing a mild evolutive perspective, Mr. Brotton is able to show how many - scattered at first - aspects that we use to associate with Reinassance, were already well present in other cultures and slowly transferred during the period ranging from the XIII and the XIV centuries.<br /><br />A leading role was played by the huge development of commerce - a first stage of the process we call today globalization.<br />Not just spices, but also silk, rugs, and goods as disparate as  tulip bulbs and home furniture. This expansion of commerce was caused by contingent factors: the Crusades, the decadence of Byzantine Empire, the closing of the silk road due to Tartar invasions in the northern steppes, the expansion of the Turkish empire first in Anatolia and then in the Balkan Peninsula, Spanish Reconquista and the flow of translation from Arab to Latin in Toledo, the rise of Italian maritime republics (not just Venice, but especially Amalfi and also Pisa and Genua)....<br /><br />So while Latin heritage was autonomously rediscovered from the dust of monastic libraries,  for the Greek heritage a leading role was played first by the Arab translations (specially in geography, medicine and philosophy), then by the Greek Byzantine refugees (specially cardinal Bessarion) and lastly - maybe marginally - by the library of Mehmet the conqueror.<br />But the Arabs are to be praised for numeracy (Fibonacci introduced Arab numbers), business (paper money, double entry, banking) seafaring instruments (sextant) and a wealth of hypotheses (heliocentrism) still to be tested in the west.<br /><br />So why in the West Renaissance in the end represented such a definite break with the past while other cultures lagged behind ?<br />Mr. Brotton very consistently explain this difference with the impact of the discovery of the printing press. Gutenberg  made the true difference: it permitted the diffusion of literacy, the rediscovery and circulation of classical culture, the infective spreading of heresies and it provided a true arena in which the new science could be debated.<br /><br />This is so far the most complete and convincing explanation of the singularity of Renaissance. And I appreciated very much the careful investigation of other hypotheses and the unassuming and almost conversational stile in which it is described - not to detriment to precision and accuracy.<br />We are presented with a multifaceted analysis of contemporary paintings, literature, history to give a pleasant and complete portrait of the period, ranging from the most intellectual achievements up to economic upheaval, social conditions and role the new discoveries in the changing landscape.<br /><br />Possibly the main deficiency of the book is in its effort to synthesize a so momentous argument in so few pages. As a reader I'd be glad to learn more about the factors that led to the decadence of the Renaissance cultural model  at the beginning of XVII century - and the ideal link between renaissance culture and Enlightenment.<br /><br />If you've been so patient and kind to follow me up to this path, there can be a chance you share some of my passions and could be interested in other books I had the opportunity to read in the past about the same argument:<br />- Dimitri Obolensky - The Byzantine Commonwealth - interesting survey on the decline of the Byzantine empire and the orthodox legacy<br />- \\"Scribes and Scholars\\" by L.D. Reynold & N.G. Wilson, still unsurpassed introduction to classical philology. One of the few books in which academic and poetical are not incompatible adjectives<br />- \\"Greek Thought and Arabic Culture\\" by Dimitri Gutas, a very interesting survey of the continuous exchanges from East to West and back from the rise of the Persian Empire to the advent of Islamism<br />-  \\"My Name is Red\\" by Ohran Pamuk a fabulous novel (a must read for sure) that uses Bellini's portrait of Mehmet the Conqueror  to illustrate the clash between the artistic tradition of  the West (art like mirror of an ideal reality) and the Eastern tradition (art like symbol and not representation)<br />You are truly welcome if  you want to suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!<br />Thanks for reading.d the unassuming and almost conversational stile in which it is described - not to detriment to precision and accuracy.

Attending in 1982 to the burial of Ephraim Markstrom, a former acquaintance, Enquist discovers the Christian diary (lebenslauf) this man kept all his life. An unusual kind of diary, exceptional in itself, since not the usual \\"closed\\" autobiography, but a great open question mark into the (true) story of the Swedish Revivalist movement.<br /><br />The writer realizes that, with this death, a piece of the history of XX century comes to a close, a story that is both the story of Christian Revivalism, of the transformation of Swedish society in a modern society and the tale of a single conscience, a soul, with his mix of contradictions, grieves, doubt and faith, religious and political.<br /><br />In particular, the diary focuses on that bleeding wound (the question mark) represented by the conflict inside the Pentecostal movement between Lewi, its historical founder, and Sven Lindman, one of its most revered voices, a disagreement that threatened to destroy it and in the end changed completely its aspect.<br /><br />The open, recurring question is WHY all this happened?<br /><br />A struggle for power? A struggle on matters of faith? Or a deep disagreement between two former friends?<br /><br />Possibly all of them and maybe none of them.<br /><br />If the story can be described with a single adjective, this is definitely \\"dense\\".<br /><br />Lewi is unquestionably the leading role: like David he fight an uneven war, like Peter he feels to be the foundation of a movement, like Moses and like Christian of the Pilgrim Progress he is walking in an uncharted and unsafe land. He feels pain in struggling, he questions his soul and looks for justification from his God, he is at loss when it comes to explain... and at the same time the struggle changes him in the deep: no more Christian of Bunjam's \\"Pilgrim Progress\\" (whom he identify with) wandering in the uncharted land of sin... or maybe more like him... when it comes to call for the comfort of his faith and identify others like sinners (more like particular sins than particular souls).<br /><br />The more he feels grace and salvation of God, the more he feels confident... but what happens to the others...?<br /><br />The individual can only maintain absolute faith in the grace of an inscrutable but ultimately merciful God in the hope of salvation. Sinners must be repelled, kept outside the movement, no matter human pain and grief involved.<br /><br />Peace is not now, peace is after, when everything will be over, when Christ will arrive.<br /><br />Do not seek to be happy, seek to be deserving of happiness.<br /><br />This is not at all an easy read, not the book you can flap now and then in a Sunday afternoon...<br /><br />And definitely it's not easy to explain why this work is so interesting - and, in the end, so beautiful.<br /><br />Possibly, again, because of its \\"denseness\\".<br /><br />There is the magmatic European conscience, the poverty of the early century, the sense of urgency of the `30s and the gradual transition to freedom from want.<br /><br />There's the attempt to understand the phenomenon of a hugely popular religious revival, of strict Lutheranism, often conflicting with \\"modern\\" attitudes... but none the less relevant aspect of XX century history.<br /><br />Enquist is not formulating a judgement.<br /><br />The participation of the writer is more sentimental (with an all pervading sadness) that rational: he does not judge, neither he tries to explain the religious experience, a kind of choice, a definitive choice, that goes well beyond right and wrong categories. But the description is consistent and the painting of early XX century very well rendered.<br /><br />The style and rhythm have a distinct northern European flavour - the influence of Kierkegaard's existentialism, with his sense of tragedy, suffering and salvation, the pietistic sensibility and his sense of urgency and hard necessity (almost a re-interpretation of \\"Pilgrim Progress\\") - with a sprinkle ofthe great American novels of the '30 and '40 (Steinbeck especially).<br /><br />The story ends leaving open questions about philosophical and political themes still debated today: the nature of community, the meaning of solidarity, the implication of faith in human relations, fundamentalism vs. tolerance, and in the end the ultimate meaning (not just interpretation, but fundamental sense) of human actions...<br /><br />Possibly a true essence is to be found in delicate and recurrent metaphors (like the iceberg, the tombstones, the travel,...), hinting that every man - builder of empires included - is alone, lives alone and, in the end, dies alone, totally unable to communicate and share with others his inner self but by rare and unexpected glimpse.<br /><br />A loneliness that is not confined to taste or feeling, but becomes tragically a parable of every life.<br /><br />Lewi is undeniably alone. Alone, fragile and possibly saved by his faith.<br /><br />As he says in his last speech:<br /><br />\\"God saves each one, one by one.<br /><br />It is in the single meeting with God, that you can find salvation\\".<br /><br />One by one.<br /><br />Before our Lord.teinbeck especially). <br />The story ends leaving open questions about philosophical and political themes still debated today: the nature of community, the meaning of solidarity, the implication of faith in human relations, fundamentalism vs. tolerance, and in the end the ultimate meaning (not just interpretation, but fundamental sense) of human actions... <br /> <br />Possibly a true essence is to be found in delicate and recurrent metaphors (like the iceberg, the tombstones, the travel,...), hinting that every man - builder of empires included - is alone, lives alone and, in the end, dies alone, totally unable to communicate and share with others his inner self but by rare and unexpected glimpse.  <br />A loneliness that is not confined to taste or feeling, but becomes tragically a parable of every life.  <br />Lewi is undeniably alone.

A more relaxed attitude in Mr. Wheen could have indicated that, after all, nothing new is under the sun.<br />Only as example, Franklin, one of the great \\"saints\\" of  Rationalism (at least for the author, who cites him at length not less than 5 times as a model) in his life was a renowned author of those same self help books (\\"The way to wealth\\" - \\"Poor Richard's Almanac\\" - but what about the copious production of self help books in XVIII century England?) that Wheen seems so much to despise; had to contend with many \\"irrational\\" phenomena - often with conflicting attitudes he could not subscribe (religious awakenings and mesmerism, to cite only two of them) and at the end of his life had to fight against a Tory government whose imperial hubris shows some aspects in common with today political conservatism.<br /><br />In a certain sense partiality comes natural.<br />The more we are distant from an age, the more we tend to idealize it, and to loose sight of the lesser and more disturbing aspects that intertwined with the (now considered) relevant features.<br /><br />The most annoying feature of the book is the tendency (openly stated) to see history from 1700 to 1979 as the Reign of Enlightenment, and from 1979 onward as the Age of Mumbo Jumbo.<br />How can it be so?<br />Can we truly talk of a long age of Enlightenment?<br />And what about Pre-romantics and Romantics?<br />Actually the great season of Enlightenment - at least on mainland Europe - was already moribund on the verge of French Revolution - and the nightmare of the two world wars was partly due also to the new idealistic philosophies of the XIX century.<br /><br />It was high time to denounce the so many pseudo-philosophies of today, most of them philosophies of egotism: those that propose a moratorium in the creation of new rights, stressing on the importance of duties (but almost always my rights vs. others' duties), those that propose a well ordered society - in which everyone know and keeps his place - as a good recipe for democracy (there's a famous author who stated that kindness and smiling employees are a prerequisite for democracy), and those stating that money is measure of all things (one dollar/one vote).<br /><br />YES, most of the problems denounced by Wheen are real and alarming, but sometimes a little wit and toleration are far better than crude sarcasm and hopeless enumeration.<br />If we believe in the power of ideas, we shouldn't be afraid of our ideas, to denounce evils AND propose emendation.<br />Prophets in the desert can be appealing, but they will do nothing to change the world if they do not advance proposals. If the ideas do not circulate.<br />Because the  true legacy of Enlightenment is probably the ability to share knowledge and ideas and not be afraid.stressing on the importance of duties (but almost always my rights vs. others' duties), those that propose a well ordered society - in which everyone know and keeps his place - as a good recipe for democracy (there's a famous author who stated that kindness and smiling employees are a prerequisite for democracy), and those stating that money is measure of all things (one dollar/one vote).

It does not challenge the reader with new revisionist hypotheses (like in Niall Ferguson's \\"The Pity of War\\"), but tries to offer an honest portrait of the period and introduce the reader to an analytical and very interesting, if mostly academic, bibliography of the argument.<br /><br />Unlike most of other presentations, this story has the supreme gift of brevity.<br /><br />Like most other studies, it tries more to cope with the questions related to the causes of World War I and World War II, than focusing on the great economic miracle that Germany experienced in the second half of XIX Century.<br /><br />Traditionalism is most visible in the theses advanced to explain the disaster of the two wars: the deep sense of frustration caused by Napoleonic invasion (\\"This shall never happen to us again!\\"), Hubris for the results attained both military and economic (\\"We can do better\\"), resulting in Nemesis (war and defeat) that causes in turn even more frustration and a distinct self-defeating pattern, the logic of disaster - and an ordinary attempt to understand the sense of aggressive dissatisfaction - almost psychoanalytical - that had so crucial role in the inception of the crisis.<br /><br />Traditional explanation does not mean \\"mediocre\\": it is amazing how Sturmer had been able to be exhaustive and compelling in so few pages!<br /><br />Besides, this small essay is flawless and it is not easy to find weaknesses. The best part is no doubt in the central chapters with the sociological analysis of change - the weakest possibly in those parts dealing with the economic progress (that are too concise and cannot match the admiration  German swift development commanded also in contemporary foreign academics and journalists - I'm thinking in the Us about Thorstein Veblen's studies on the subject).<br /><br />There's a very interesting remark about the decadence of Diplomacy (praised for his stabilizing long term effects) as one important source of the instability in the fin de Siecle International politics. But the thesis is not developed as it could: diplomatic tradition (that is also \\"bonne manieres\\" and supranational ancient regime) versus promethean romanticism (that is individualism, bonapartism, will of power and nationalism). Possibly Romanticism was the true new trait in the European political arena (the uncompromising extremism of the early French Revolution, the promethean &eacute;lan of the French Empire, the all encompassing dimension of German Idealism): in the transmission of this \\"virulent disease\\" German nationalism and world wars constituted only the last dramatic stage. A thesis brilliantly unfolded for the history of ideas by Isaiah Berlin in his excellent \\"The Roots of Romanticism\\".<br /><br />\\"The great seminal catastrophe of our century, to quote the US diplomat-cum-historian George Kennan, was to leave nothing unchanged: not the proud nation-states of Europe, not the relationship of the sexes not poetry, painting or music, not the idea of the past or any vision of the future, not the human soul. To quote the title of the poet Robert Graves' memoir of the trenches, it was Goodbye to All That\\"(pag.80).<br /><br />One question then have been patently neglected, resulting in more definite, black and white, but less accurate  picture (the \\"gute alte Zeiten\\" of Bismarck opposed to the capricious and irresponsible later Wilhelmine politics).<br />Was Bismarck authoritarian conservatism a model for following totalitarian experiments (both in Italy and in Germany)? Did Prussian militarism play any role in setting a model for following totalitarian experiments?<br />I suspect the answer is YES and that the European totalitarian experiments of the `30s were initially empirical attempts to replicate the model of Bismarck conservative revolution and to confront social unrest and economic upheaval with the call for more order and discipline.<br />If so, some seed of disaster was deep rooted inside that same policy that had been formerly paramount in avoiding it.policy that had been formerly paramount in avoiding it.	2005-02-14

The cautious and balanced use of force, diplomacy (both political and religious) and money. The widespread and deep phenomenon of inclusion and assimilation of cultural values that Constantinople inspired. The gradual political emancipation of the emerging new nations (Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia, Hungary and lastly Rumania)<br /><br />It ends in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople to the Turkish armies: in that moment the Byzantine commonwealth disintegrates and the great eastern diasporas begin (with the rise of the myth of the third Rome in Russia, the emergence of the principalities of Rumania, the defeat and toll of resentment in the Serbian and Balkan lands).<br /><br />Obolensky's study is already somehow outdated since first printed in 1971 for the \\"History of Civilization\\" Series of Phoenix Press (in the same series you can find the still unsurpassed \\"The Greek Experience\\" by C. M. Bowra,). It cannot take account of the events following the disintegration of USSR and the widespread renaissance of an Orthodox \\"koin&egrave;\\" (cultural community), especially religious but sometimes also political and social (this at least is one of the - highly debatable - theses advanced by professor Samuel P. Huntington in \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\"): a feature this one that cannot change the overall picture, but is nonetheless a strong indication about how deeper went the Byzantine influence.<br /><br />\\"The Byzantine Commonwealth\\" is sometimes very specific, and yet immensely interesting.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed the history of the missionary work and travels of st.Constantine (Cyril) and Methodius, their invention of the Glagolitic (and later Cyrillic) script and the inception of the movement of translation from Greek to Old Church Slavonic (the medieval common language of the Slavic populations).<br /><br />Compelling are also the chapters dealing with the presence and spreading of heretical movements, especially Paulicianism and Bogomilism, sects influenced by Manicheism and that very likely \\"exerted a powerful influence upon the Patarene and Cathar (or Albigesian) movements in Italy and Southern France\\".<br /><br />It is amazing to realize the scantiness of  our knowledge and the prejudices we still retain about the Byzantine world. While for Rome and classical Greece we have still outstanding and impressive remains (temples, theatres, aqueducts, weapons and literature), the whitewash following the Turkish conquest and censure of history (from \\"the idle liars of neither gender\\" of bishop Liutprand of Cremona to the \\"tedious and uniform tale of weakness and misery\\" of Gibbon) have almost cancelled a thousand years of European history.<br /><br />The Iron Curtain tried to eradicate the deep-rooted marks of a common culture of the Russian and Balkan lands: a heritage of art and faith, common language and culture.<br /><br />But this civilization has been able to endure the floodings of history, Turkish conquests and Socialist utopias.<br /><br />And this is one of those rare books than can make us feel the warmth of this candle, still alight.<br /><br />In the Epilogue a part deserves to be cited in full because of its poetic and evocative force:<br /><br />\\"It is hence not surprising that the fall of Constantinople aroused these countries immediate feelings of horror and dismay. Greeks, Slavs and Rumanians reacted to this event by composing laments, in poetry and prose, for the captured and strickencity. A Greek popular poem probably composed in the second half of the fifteenth century, describes an imaginary scene of the last liturgy celebrated in St Sophia in the presence of the emperor and the patriarch, which was interrupted by the arrival of the infidels: as tears were seen in the eyes of the Virgin on the church's icons, the clergy was commanded by voice from heaven to send the cross, the Gospel book and the holy table to Western Europe lest they be profaned by the Turks.

This is due to the distance - both temporal and cultural - from our world and that society.<br /><br />It is natural that when we think about a library, a bookshop, a writer, a book - we ask for the help of everyday experience. A bookstore is a bookstore. A book a book... like in everyday experience. .<br /><br />And yet, under the surface of apparent similarity,  we come to discover a far different truth.<br /><br />This truth is unendingly announcing the miracle of historical, literary, medical, philosophical, ... texts, most of them dating back about 2500 years that have been able to reach us in adventurous and often incredible  ways.<br /><br />The strong archaeological approach, is probably responsible for the  difficulty to present is a comprehensive analysis of libraries, books, literacy in the larger context of a far different society and the problems of text transmission in an age still far from Gutenberg.<br /><br />Ancient World was different from our own (and different as well the Latin World from the Greek)<br /><br />Just to name some differences that are not considered in the exposition:<br /><br />- Problems in reading and spelling - contrary to our books, the ancient rolls and codices were written in almost exclusively in capital letters, and with no spacing between words. This presented insurmountable difficulties for people with low literacy and asked for far better knowledge of language and language skills  than we have today. Besides it made text corruption far easier.<br /><br />- Reading aloud - today reading conveys the idea of a quiet space and of silence. Actually one of the most astonishing differences between us and them is signalled by Augustine, when he writes in the \\"Confessions\\" that his master Ambrose (bishop of Milan) was capable to read \\"without emitting any sound nor moving the tongue\\".... that is: reading in the classical times consisted only in reading aloud... in turn the act of making a copy of a text is to be more properly described as being dictated, and libraries were not the silent sanctuaries we know today, but rather different noisy places more similar probably to modern Koranic schools.<br /><br />- Spreading of illiteracy. In this, Greek and Latin world were probably different. In the west, literacy resented early of a progressive decline, that coupled with the passage from roll to codex created a momentous phenomenon of deterioration, especially in some fields (not just many technical and scientific books were lost, but as well many less read writers (it is funny that a technical innovation ended speeding the process of decadence). This phenomenon of progressive narrowing of scope was further aggravated by the spreading of illiteracy during the early Middle Age: in many mosaics of this period painters end up to represent books as closed, both because unable themselves to write and because people around them are no more able to read. Illiteracy, difficulty in text reading, all coupled with a worsening of Latin and Greek knowledge (specially in the West), had big impact on the transmission of texts.<br /><br />There is also a second trait of the account I do not agree.<br /><br />This is the over-simplification according to which we have a Greek and Latin Culture in total opposition to other \\"barbarian\\" (i.e. of lesser species) cultures, that contributed more or less to the decline into the Middle ages.<br /><br />Actually this is not so.<br /><br />And especially so for the main opposition presented: that between Greek  Byzantine Empire and \\"Eastern\\" cultures.<br /><br />There's an implicit assumption (sometimes annoyingly made explicit) according to which Arabs erased all sign of Greek culture in the newly conquered lands - a newly presented argument for a learned and cultured West versus inferior and unsophisticated East.<br /><br />Actually there are strong indications this is far from correct and that an osmosis between Greek culture and \\"Eastern\\" cultures was well established at least since the reign of emperor Justinian. Not only does the contemporary historiographer Agatia tell us the story about translations into Persian commissioned by Corsoe I, king of Persia (Historiae, B28.1), but the same king did give sanctuary to many philosophers of the School of Athens, after this pagan institution was forcibly closed by order of the emperor.<br /><br />As for the Arabs, since the very beginning of their rule, there was a momentous activity of translation (at least three great waves are recorded of this phenomenon) from Greek to Arab (often through Syriac) that in turn caused a new osmosis from Arabic lands to the Byzanthine empire since the IX century and from Arab Spain and Sicily to the Latin West as far as XII Century, well before the fall of Byzantium and the looming of European Renaissance (the Salernitan School, St Tomas Aquinas,...).<br /><br />We must thank all these Arab scribes, philosophers, booksellers, translators and enlightened rulers if we can enjoy today so much of the Greek literature.<br /><br />One of my passion (if you did not guess already) is the history of the transmission of books - specially in the larger context of classical western culture.<br /><br />If anyone does share this interest, could be interested in a few books I had the chance to read in the past about this argument:<br /><br />- \\"The Vanished Library\\" by Luciano Canfora (possibly the most authoritative story of the Royal Library in Alexandria),<br /><br />- \\"Scribes and Scholars\\" by L.D.

One of the most cited and the most praised.<br /><br />There are wonderful  travel related books about the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Besides the many famous, I remember with gratitude the excellent \\"Mediterranean. Portrait of a Sea\\" by Ernle Bradford, possibly the best book ever written on this argument - and the most evocative, true poetry in prose, \\"On a Voiceless Shore - Byron in Greece\\" by Stephen Minta with the priceless metaphor that begins: \\"There is a frontier in Europe, marked on few maps....

Well... actually I'm still asking myself the question.<br /><br />And the answer is not easy.<br /><br />I'd probably re-read with pleasure, yes, and I would recommend it to friends, yes.<br /><br />Undeniably this is a book that stimulates imagination and has the ability to evoke, but...<br /><br />But the \\"dish\\" is sometimes a bit too elaborate, descriptions most of the time a bit too synthetic to enjoy at leisure and also exposition is - possibly willingly (in the style of ancient Latin \\"saturae\\") -  haphazard.<br /><br />Like with an elaborate dish by nouvelle cuisine, here everything looks, smells and tastes good... you are captured by endless variations of colors and forms, but in the end you feel frustrated by scarcity and with a distressing sense of hunger.<br /><br />Its main virtue consists in being a successful effort to evoke a world almost totally disappeared, stressing on the points of contact between the many peoples and cultures living on its shores (the Latin, Slav, Greek, Turkish, Jewish and Arabic) more than on the already over-stressed differences.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you do not know already the background, it will be difficult to follow, perceive and appreciate the argument. Because most of the book is rotating on a endless variation of the same themes, presented under different points of view, and often in a most rarefied poetic dimension.<br /><br />This happens specially in the first of the three parts in which the book is divided (\\"Breviary\\" - the other two are \\"Maps\\" and \\"Glossary\\") while in the other two this impression is less vivid.<br /><br />Anyway most of the world here presented as still existing, was already totally vanished by the 1960s' and since then it has been transferred to the realm of mythical utopia, that blunders edges and fades true colors.

We're not presented with the heroic efforts of the Second and Third Aliah (truly heroic  from my point of view) and nether with the blooming of desert by kibbutzim or larger than life portraits of Ben Gurion, Moshe Dayan and Golda Meyr.<br /><br />Far from this.<br /><br />The best part of the book is no doubt the one dedicated to the Yom Kippur war: here O'Brien is at his best showing his consummate ability in unveiling the many forces at work and presenting a different but strongly built theory about how conflict was produced, a theory according to which both the Israeli and Egyptians were \\"played\\" by the machiavellian strategy of Kissinger in an unnecessary conflict.<br /><br />One reason to read this book is obviously an interest for the history of Israel.<br /><br />An other (at least for me), is the appreciation for the works and ideas of  the author.<br /><br />By O'Brien I had had the chance to read \\"The Long Affair - Thomas Jefferson and The French Revolution\\", a book in which, while not always  agreeing with conclusions, I truly appreciated this method: not plain history, not pamphlet... but a carefully and detailed research (both in that and this book, it is amazing the amount of material and documents that have been taken into account), the constant analysis of options at hand (not just what happened but what could have happened if...) supported not by wishful thinking but by hard data - and not least appealing a certain tendency of the author to test his argument almost taking it to extreme consequences (in a sheer Popperian attitude).om this.  <br /> <br />The best part of the book is no doubt the one dedicated to the Yom Kippur war: here O'Brien is at his best showing his consummate ability in unveiling the many forces at work and presenting a different but strongly built theory about how conflict was produced, a theory according to which both the Israeli and Egyptians were \\"played\\" by the machiavellian strategy of Kissinger in an unnecessary conflict.  <br /> <br />One reason to read this book is obviously an interest for the history of Israel. <br />An other (at least for me), is the appreciation for the works and ideas of  the author.  <br />By O'Brien I had had the chance to read \\"The Long Affair - Thomas Jefferson and The French Revolution\\", a book in which, while not always  agreeing with conclusions, I truly appreciated this method: not plain history, not pamphlet... but a carefully and detailed research (both in that and this book, it is amazing the amount of material and documents that have been taken into account), the constant analysis of options at hand (not just what happened but what could have happened if...) supported not by wishful thinking but by hard data - and not least appealing a certain tendency of the author to test his argument almost taking it to extreme consequences (in a sheer Popperian attitude).	2004-11-30

Obviously it is more focused on the intellectual dimension of Dutch Golden Age, but also much more attentive to individual destinies, not just Spinoza's.<br /><br />What is so special in this book?<br /><br />First, of course, the portrait of Spinoza, a delicate and difficult task since the extant testimonies about his life are very thin and mostly connected with the thinker and not with the man. To recreate a so vivid portrait from so tiny fragments is probably the best achievement of this book.<br /><br />Then the portrait of Amsterdam from the special point of view of the Jewish Sephardim community, the attention to the (truly fascinating) history and peculiarity of this community with its links with mainstream European Judaism, and the special interest  in describing everyday life.<br /><br />Not lastly the great harvest of anecdotic tales, so many of them to create the texture or a big canvas depicting the time), mostly connected with the main argument, but some of them with a life of their own - and many real gems.<br /><br />I'm thinking especially about<br /><br />- the case of Uriel Da Costa, a member of a prominent and respectable family in Amsterdam Sephardim Community (maybe even connected by family with Spinoza) who in 1640 - after having been excommunicated from the community after having lost his faith (the sad part is that he wanted, but was no more able, to believe in a personal God) - shot himself in the head.<br /><br />- the history of one of the first Jewish (and to some extent Christian too) great awakenings at the call of the so-called Messiah of Smyrna, Sabbatai Levi in 1666: \\"Jews in various part of the Middle East and Europe were taken by a messianic frenzy...began selling their goods... preparing for their joint return to the Holy Land\\".<br /><br />-  the events following the conversion to Catholicism of Albert Burgh, the scion of a wealthy regent family of Amsterdam and former friend of Spinoza, who after a travel to Italy and a deep crisis of conscience regained his faith rejecting the impious Cartesian method and the Spinozist rationality.<br /><br />- not last the story of the lynching and murder of the Grand Pensionary Johan De Witt, one of the greatest European intellectuals of the time, and this brother by the Orangist mob in 1672, the year of French invasion of Holland. That night Spinoza was prevented by his landlord \\"to go out at night and post a placard near the site of the massacre, reading ULTIMI BARBARORUM (roughly translated \\"You are the greatest of all barbarians\\")\\"<br /><br />Sometimes imperfection in a book can be a great virtue.<br /><br />This book creates as many questions as the answers it tries to give.<br /><br />It left me a great curiosity to investigate on Spinoza's circle of friend and to inquire further in that special dimension (still not so distinct, as it will be a century later in Enlightenment Europe) that is the Republic of Letters of the XVII Century.<br /><br />The greatest limit of the book is that it conveys the idea that the thinker was a kind of contemplative hermit. And yet it advances a great deal of evidence suggesting a totally different hypothesis: his wide net of correspondents, not least with Leibniz and Oldenburg (at the time Secretary of the Royal Society), the evidence of his ties with the De Witt clan and with many prominent regent families, not last the great \\"mystery\\" of his \\"trip behind the enemy lines\\" to meet the Great Conde (head of French army) in occupied Utrecht and the secrecy that clouds his death (according to the testimonies he died almost unexpectedly, assisted - or helped ? - by a mysterious unidentified man) are maybe a strong indication of a secretive and reserved mind.<br /><br />Possibly the same fact of the so many people that visibly ignored (De Witt) or publicly defamed (the Cartesians, Oldenburg, Leibnitz, Stouppe,...) Spinoza and privately kept on having friendly relations with him, indicates a different condition, a double moral, widely - and shyly  - practiced by others and an unshaken coherence, kept strictly private, from his side, ... a pale looming of a larger freer dimension that prepares the European Enlightenment.<br /><br />Of course there are many other themes that are considered and explained: philosophical, religious and political... but remember that this is not a strictly philosophic analysis and its main effort has been directed to understand how the contemporary problems and events did shape the life and the environment around the man, and lastly contributed to the development of his particular philosophy.vidence suggesting a totally different hypothesis: his wide net of correspondents, not least with Leibniz and Oldenburg (at the time Secretary of the Royal Society), the evidence of his ties with the De Witt clan and with many prominent regent families, not last the great \\"mystery\\" of his \\"trip behind the enemy lines\\" to meet the Great Conde (head of French army) in occupied Utrecht and the secrecy that clouds his death (according to the testimonies he died almost unexpectedly, assisted - or helped ? - by a mysterious unidentified man) are maybe a strong indication of a secretive and reserved mind.  <br />Possibly the same fact of the so many people that visibly ignored (De Witt) or publicly defamed (the Cartesians, Oldenburg, Leibnitz, Stouppe,...)

I recommend the book to readers interested in history as well as in history of ideas.<br /><br />As a non-specialist reader, I enjoyed \\"The Metaphysical Club\\" because it is not just history of a philosophical movement, but, from a wider point of view, an attempt of analysis of the intellectual history of Post Civil War USA. Besides it is well written, clear and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Pragmatism tell us that ideas are \\"tools\\" we use to cope with the outside world and that the truth of a proposition is based on how well it correlates with experimental results and produces practical outcomes.<br /><br />Menand is showing us how Pragmatism was born to cope with the brave new world born after the Civil war. And to do this he isn't writing a philosophical pamphlet about the new ideas and the ensuing debates ... but prefer to investigate exemplary lives of  its representative members.<br /><br />So in the first three parts we follow the lives of Olivier Wendell Holmes Jr, William James, Pierce, Wright, not usually in their private dimensions, but mostly in the public events that shaped their view of the world. Those chapters are definitely the most interesting of all the book since the author is able to present - also with the help of fascinating anecdotes - an organic vision of the historical period, with its debates (abolitionism, segregation, evolutionism...), its champions and the social humus ...<br /><br />The last chapters about Dewey are far less interesting. Part Four (Dewey) is very different both in style and in argument. Sincerely I couldn't have understood only by these pages why Dewey was a such an important thinker, neither who were his intellectual opponents.<br /><br />I have reserves as well on Part Five, the attempt to illustrate some significant terms in the debates (Freedom, Pluralism, Pragmatism), since again it cannot match style and effectiveness of the historical method pursued in the first parts and it result sometimes a bit too intellectual and celebrative.<br /><br />If I can advance an other remark, I truly cannot understand why the author resolved to focus so much on the debate that develops inside the American colleges (all the actors are university professors or \\"specialists\\"): sure, Pragmatism was a Philosophical movement, but a \\"pragmatist\\" -intellectually relevant - approach was deep-rooted in the American intellectual attitudes well before the age of Holmes (I'm thinking especially of Franklin, but not just him) and not only in Massachusetts, where it develops also in reaction to the transcendentalist-romantic movement of early XIX century.brative. <br /> <br />If I can advance an other remark, I truly cannot understand why the author resolved to focus so much on the debate that develops inside the American colleges (all the actors are university professors or \\"specialists\\"): sure, Pragmatism was a Philosophical movement, but a \\"pragmatist\\" -intellectually relevant - approach was deep-rooted in the American intellectual attitudes well before the age of Holmes (I'm thinking especially of Franklin, but not just him) and not only in Massachusetts, where it develops also in reaction to the transcendentalist-romantic movement of early XIX century.	2004-10-01

First, let me say that this is a selection of Berlin editorials, arranged by Henry Hardy.<br />The title is a quotation from Heine, who warned the French not to undervalue the power of ideas, since philosophical concepts nurtured in the peace of a library can destroy a civilization.<br />Under this auspices, it seemed a very interesting theme: how the history of ideas has reflected upon, challenged and ultimately changed reality. The unseen code of reality.<br />But the outcome is not par to the expectations. Well, Berlin is a first class philosopher and always highly entertaining. But the arrangement made here is at least a little haphazard: an attempt of intellectual autobiography (written in old age), editorials about history of philosophy, about the Russian late `800 intellectual environment, about socialism and Marxism, some incomplete considerations about freedom, editorials about Zionism and the birth of the State of Israel.....<br />Too much indeed and too many themes.<br />The best parts are the one dedicated to history of philosophy, since Berlin is one of those rare writers who is able to cast an entirely new light on the arguments he decides to investigate: the appraisal of  Enlightenment is excellent (especially as Age of Mechanics opposed to the Age of Mathematics in the XVII Century), as well the essay about the purposes of Philosophy and one on the essence of European Romanticism (on this argument the best book is still his \\"The Roots of Romanticism\\", I warmly recommend). But, these are pearls scattered here and there with no apparent order.<br />Better would have been to focus it much more on a restricted number of arguments.<br />I'm a curious and voracious reader.

It is the same victim, a miniaturist, who tells the story of his death, describing as well his deep sorrow for the loss of the pleasures of life and his puzzlement for his curious new state of unrest.<br />But this is not a police story.<br />In the following chapters a gold coin, a dog, two dervishes, a tree will tell new stories... new murders will happen ... until the violent end of the killer that \\"restore\\" the equilibrium.<br />If not a police story, what kind of novel is this?<br />Well, it has been likened to Eco's \\"Name of  The Rose\\" and the writer has been likened to Borges for his visionary and metaphysical imagination, but I believe there's much more: a kind of melancholy for the passing of time and its irreparable loss, the fascination for books and painting, the clashing of two different worlds (not only the East and the west, but also inside the Islamic faith), and far above, below and inside, the sense of life, flowing of life, of passion, love and delicate all-pervasive compassion and humanity, painted with such a craftsmanship to leave you open-mouthed.<br />So, if I must liken this book to something, it his the famous painting \\"The Tempest\\" of Giorgione who first come to mind. Not the description in itself his important here, but the whole portrait, the \\"sense of life\\" that delicately comes out from the many layers of painting.<br />On a purely literary level, I was amazed at the ability of the writer in mastering story and style: there are parts in which the expert reader can identify a portrait in the style of Dostoevskij... but loo... only for few pages ... only a hint of colour, because the writer is now changing again and using irony, and he seems to softly challenge you.<br />This is one of those rare books (rare indeed) in which you deeply regret, the more you proceed in reading, that inevitably the novel will reach an end.<br />I'm a passionate reader.

US	52478625	RIWV77W05BSLT	0226616533	974227305	The Long Affair: Thomas Jefferson and the French Revolution, 1785-1800	Books	5	5	9	N	N	An indictment of Thomas Jefferson's Legacy	Jefferson is one of the most revered fathers of the United States.<br />His sphinx-like profile, while showing some fissure, can still command today great reverence. Most of biographies about him underline the romantic-like &eacute;lan and the inspiring vision that constitute his legacy, while alluding marginally and with benign neglect to the many inconsistencies that characterize his life.<br /><br />I happened to read this essay, shortly after \\"American Sphinx\\" by J.J Ellis: the leaflet on the book promised to mount an indictment of Jefferson's ideal heritage, and the credential of the writer, a former UN official, were flawless.  I must admit that the book did exceed the most optimistic expectation.<br /><br />While I cannot agree completely with the indictment and the conclusion (the threat posed by Jefferson legacy to American Civil religion), I did greatly  enjoy this reading. It demands respect for the quantity of the documents scrutinized, for the careful philological method used to interpret them, for the sharp logic used in building up the case and for the careful balancing and evaluation of different perspectives.<br /><br />This is a detailed analysis of the political thought of Thomas Jefferson.Not a personal attack to the man: private life and biography enter only when it may be of help in understanding the development of his political ideas. The indictment is focused especially in the exposing of the grand smoke-screen that revolutionary rhetoric offered him to resist the more liberal attitudes of others revolutionary leading figures. In other words Jefferson, more or less knowingly, appropriated of the grand ideals of the Revolution not to further a new order but to rescue the conservative attitudes of the South and in this attempt he helped to create a dangerous compromise, responsible for the Civil War and still present - under different aspects - in the American political thought. This divorce between action and thought permits to account for the apparently \\"mistakes\\" of the man Jefferson: his lenient judgement of the French revolution - even in the most bloodied hours of the Terror, his attitudes towards slavery, his many slips both in private life and in the political arena. And that same  obscurity is responsible for the romantic aura that still surrounds his myth.<br /><br />A weakness of the book is that is often very \\"dry\\" in style: terse, but a bit too concise and uninspiring.This is possibly caused by a rather excessive focusing on the main theme: everything has been developed as in an effort to economy. Biography is almost reduced to mere facts and - as I told before - enters only when that can help to understand Jefferson's political ideas, the Enlightenment ideals and the revolution are narrowed to the theme considered (it is not even mentioned the famous letter about \\"whether one generation of men has a right to bind another\\") and there's almost no attempt to psychological analysis. The force of Logic supersedes Rhetoric. Possibly this is a voluntary effort to expose Jefferson's rhetoric in the name of hard substance, but none the less I believe the book could be much more pleasant with some touch of colour.<br /><br />Possibly a lesser fault is also the neglect in analysing the Jefferson role and place in the European Society of the Ancient Regime.After all Jefferson (with Franklin and maybe more than Franklin) was one of the most \\"European\\" of the revolutionary leaders. He denied often the links, he showed to despise the European models, and yet he still is a leading figure in pre-revolutionary France (he was friend with Lafayette, with Condorcet, with the salon of madame Helvetius) and his ideas can be best explained on the light of the European pre-romantic movement, with all the emphasis on contrast between heart-purity-uncorrupted nature-individual versus  mind-civilities-corruption of progress-society.An analysis of this attitudes could have cast light on the \\"divorce\\" of the ideal man (the Jefferson thinker-philosopher) from the actual man (the Jefferson slave owner and cunning political man), a divorce that is typical of many - if not most - European pre-romantics (Rousseau, but also the first Goethe).<br /><br />While much has been written about the debt to British and Scottish Enlightenment, as far as I know, it seems a balanced assessment of the mutual debt of European pre-revolutionary society and American Revolutionary Thought is still lacking.And yet in Paris we can observe a great turmoil of ideas - in which American intellectuals have a leading role: Franklin and Jefferson, of course, but also Adams, Jay, Paine,...

An excellent book!I spotted this essay already a year ago, while surfing the philosophy bookshelf, but actually decided to read only after a very positive review published a few months ago by Mario Vargas-Llosa on El Pais.What is so interesting about it? Well, first, it is a very concise history of contemporary philosophy, focusing on the thought of two great XX Century minds and proposed with a language and in a way that can result easy and clear (that doesn't mean imprecise anyway) also to the non academic reader. As an history of philosophy it presents with many examples problems as \\"causation\\", \\"verification\\", \\"inductive reasoning\\" and \\"falsification\\"  Secondly, it is a very interesting portrait of fin de siecle Vienna with its intellectual turmoil, its still multicultural population, intersected with the smaller personal stories of immensely wealthy Wittgenstein family and solid middle class respectability of Popper's family. But the real value of the book rests on other aspects. One is the ability in describing situations and  characters. In dealing with Popper the authors are very able to explain why his thought was so revolutionary, specially if considered against the English mainstream works: the same popperian theory of extreme verification and the boldness (if not violence) in putting forward his own opinions is the actual negation of British politeness and understatement... and it could show strong link with the clashing verbal violence of some European movements (not only Nietzsche, Hegelianism, Marxism... but also the fascism and nazism whose intellectual roots he was to \\"falsify\\" and denounce ). On the other hand a very fine if puzzling portrait comes out of Wittgenstein. I had the feeling that the authors could not really grasp his true essence and this they admit with puzzlement: the more you come near, the more you feel far from him. So he appears like an ancient saviour, larger than life, a kind of Eraclitus, you can describe by the clash of contrary evidence...  There's a very fine chapter, near the end, in which they try to inquire about the Wittgenstein's point of view of the 10 minutes argument . There's very tiny written or remaining evidence... but they make through  with a delicate analysis remembering the one of Virginia Woolf  in her novels.... What you cannot define with reason, you can grasp with intuition... . but of course, this is only a guess.I truly enjoyed this book, and I warmly recommend to everyone may be interested in Logic, philosophy or just in well researched journalism. Feel free to write me if you want share some opinion about it or - even better - if you can recommend similar essays: I'm a good reader and love arguing and sharing my opinion.

From the same author I had already red \\"The Cash Nexus\\" and had been very favourably impressed both for the readability and the argument (usually a mix of history and economics, not just economic history).<br />Well, about the content, this is not the usual history of First World War.<br />It is an attempt to look behind the stage of historical events, to try to evaluate the actual outcome of the events on the light of the choices available to the \\"actors\\". Looking at what might have happened (and did not happen) can help to cast new light on the meaning of actual events.<br />The question \\"what... if\\" from which the inquiry starts, is a great stimulus for the reader not just to enjoy the book but also to evaluate the conclusions of the author.<br />I greatly enjoyed this book even if I do not agree with some of Ferguson theses.<br />In particular the critic to the common idea that a culture favourable to the world arise in the last decades of XIX century is a bit excessive (on the light of the thought and following of thinkers like Wagner, Nietzsche, Darwinism with the survival of the fittest,... not to speak about Futurism and the like).<br />I was also a bit unsettled by the allegations about the role of Keynes as a fifth German column in the discussions of war reparations: it may well be, but I believe the arguments used are a bit too personal (the alleged \\"possible\\" love affair with dr. Melchior) or overstated (this influence on British public opinion and government in the aftermath of the war).<br />Then, as a \\"continental\\" European I've been really upset by the argument that, after all, it would have been better if  the Germans won the blitzkrieg and formed a kind of proto-common European Market... Right, it would have cost less in terms of lives. Right, the Greater Reich wouldn't be in competition with the British Empire... and right... we would probably have avoided  II WW, but in what kind of world we would live today?	2003-09-12
