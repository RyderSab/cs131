Cookbook	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Had To Buy It	I first borrowed this from the library and noted so many recipes that I wanted to copy that I bought it instead. I am a cookbook collector and this book is truly wonderful. Sheila is a great, descriptive writer - your mouth waters just reading about the recipes. I also suggest you get her other 2 cookbooks: The New Basics, and The Silver Palate Cookbook - both are classics by now, I believe. Anyways, this book is great and I'm using it all the time.	2005-06-04

The author is not a big fan of chocolate (she explains that herself) so don't buy it for chocolate recipes. She's a big fan of pecans and peanut butter. The recipes are very homey and delicious. If I'd never heard of Magnolia and received it as a gift, I'd be a happy woman. Hope you enjoy it, too.	2004-12-03

I read some of the negative reviews and was not surprised at how people pick, pick, pick at good, positive things. Those are the ones who truly need to read this wonderful book. Whether the author gained his knowledge from others doesn't matter to me. He quotes numerous sources of inspiration throughout the book. And whatever his past was (as some reviewers insist on telling us about) doesn't matter either. What matters is the message this book is giving. Quite simply &quot;Get over yourself.&quot; This author has greatly assisted me on my journey, and so have other authors, and I'm sure more will in the future. That's called living and it's part of life. Once you stop opening up to learning and seeking knowledge than you will be consumed in your negativity and wind up becoming bitter and nasty. If this book finds its way into your hands, consider yourself blessed and do try to read it with an open, loving mind.	2004-05-28

Stewart. This is a good cookbook. I am not Wiccan nor do I practice any &quot;craft&quot; I simply cook in my kitchen. There are recipes in here for everyone. I tweaked the crescent moon rolls recipe into rugalech, don't like poppy seeds so instead added apricot preserves with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious. No, I'm not Jewish, either; just someone who knows her way around a kitchen and appreciates a good cookbook. This is it. I encourage you to buy it. Enjoy!	2003-12-31

First, the book is quite heavy (literally) and there is just soooo much information, that myself as a home cook/baker just was overwhelmed. I love to bake bread but I really have been doing fine without all the scientific stuff. The ingredient and equipment list would cost a small fortune. The author obviously does not live on a middle income or less yearly budget. Some recipes she says to use Gold Medal flour or bleached, others she says Hecker's ONLY, and others she says White Lily and still others she says unbleached! I don't have that kind of room in my kitchen. And if I had the All-Clad pans and clay pans she uses, I'd have someone else baking for me! I was disappointed, you may not be. I bought this book for a good deal through my book club, but I will not be keeping it.	2003-12-10

Try reading Shakti Gawain, Karen Rausch Carter, Carolyn Myss and Deepak Chopra. This author goes into astrology (and a lot of it is very wrong), and almost makes up her own chakra colors.

It is, put quity simply, a good cooking cookbook. Anna is a friendly writer,  who doesn't name drop like other cookbok authors who live in our area do.

Definately surpassed my expectations, but it is not the be-all and end-all of baking books. I wouldn't go so far as to give it 10 stars (as a previous reviewer wished) nor would I chuck all my other cookbooks and use this one as \\"the definitive classic\\" (as the same previous reviewer did). However, for a good baking book, this will suit you well. There are many fine baking authors out there you should try, such as: Gale Gand, Rose Levy Berenbaum, Lisa Yockelson, and Susan Gold Purdy. Don't throw away your other cookbooks just because King Arthur came out with a new book. Place it on your shelf with the other authors' books you may own. It will be in good company.	2003-09-21

Ellen is a warm writer, with wonderful, helpful &quot;Ellen's Tips&quot; on each page, but there seems to be something missing, almost lazy about these recipes. If you like to bake bread, don't look here, the author does not bake bread.I will use it, and gave it 3 stars because 3 stars to me means good, not very good, and that's good enough for me.

I read this book back in '78 when it first came out. I loved it then and love it even more now that it's the full unabridged version. I don't understand how anyone could not like it. It's got everything in it: drama, suspense, sex, comedy, gore, etc. there's something for everybody. Yes of course it's looooong, it's Stephen King! He is well-known for being long-winded. If you want a fast read, then read Patterson or someone else. Man, I read this book just about every year and as another reviewer said, I still pick-up little things that I didn't notice before (it's almost creepy). It's a classic. Every King fan will tell you that their favorite is either The Stand or The Gunslinger series. Hey, I've been reading this guy for 26 years, yeah, he's my favorite fiction writer. This book is, of course, my favorite. Give it a chance.	2003-07-28

I did not care for waffles until my daughter bought me a waffle iron this past Christmas. So, my search for recipes (I never made them before) began. I found Ms. Greenspan's recipe for Spicy Ricotta Waffles on the the foodtv.com site and they were so delicious that I looked up info on the book on Amazon. Thank goodness! The author covers all areas, from appetizers to desserts. She also includes dips, spreads, oils, etc. Delicious recipes. As another reviewer noted, yes, give this cookbook with a waffle iron to newlyweds, but also to any and everyone who likes waffles. I love this book! You can even make toasted cheese sandwiches in your waffle iron - did you know that? I didn't!!	2003-06-15

This is one of the best baking books I ever invested in. I am an avid cookbook reader/collector. Ms. Goldman's writing is warm and inviting, however, you must be careful with her baking times - they are way, way off. It is not our stove (it is properly calibrated) so I know it wasn't me. As long as you keep an eye on a timer and periodically check, you'll be fine. Also, the time it takes to do ANY of the bread/dough kneading is way, way off too. It takes much less time than she notes - in ALL those recipes too. If you can handle that than I strongly suggest you buy this wonderful cookbook, I did and we love it.	2003-06-08

Reading the other reviews there is not too much more I can say that my 5-Star rating doesn't already convey to you. This is a powerful book. If reading about channeling isn't your thing, try picking up a Deepak Chopra book, namely Creating Affluence (in all areas of your life, not just money). It's an almost obvious message when you read this book. Try remembering when you were younger and you'd watch movies, etc. about curses and someone wise would say something like, &quot;If you believe it, then it WILL happen. So stop worrying.&quot; Well, I guess these basic thought patterns have always been there, but Seth will help you to see that it applies to everthing and everybody.	2003-05-13

If you are open-minded or ready for change, this just may be the book you need. Get it from the library first, (as I did) and I bet you'll wind up buying it, (as I did).

What's that saying, &quot;You will never see the big picture until you remove yourself from it.&quot; Well, step aside, get out of your own way and let the universe perform its wonders on you.

It's an easy read. The author is gentle, kind and helps you along the way. However, I could not help but notice I had read these things (almost word for word) in 2 other books. One was by Florence Scovel Schinn called The Game Of Life and How to Play It, the other was by Louise Hay called You Can Heal Your Life. Well, all the ladies are wonderful reads, but they are all basically the same book. Now, Shakti does state that this book is more or less a culmination of all that she previously learned/read, and she MUST have read The Game of Life; Florence lived at the turn of the century, but (and it's a big but) Louise Hay does not credit any other author for her work and she wrote her book years AFTER Shakti. Hmmmm, what' up with that? Anyways, I've got all 3 books they are all absolutely great, and each one teaches you creative visualization in its own way. Get one or get them all.

Lo and behold I stumbled upon this book, bought it used at a library sale and am back to those damn (ha-ha) morning writings. Well, I must tell you that this woman is a genius. Not only have these pages been quite an inspiration and a positive flow for me, but the &quot;assignments&quot; she asks you to undertake are life changing.

Our satellite TV company does not get the Style Channel, so I am unable to see Nigella's show that my sister talks and talks about. Obviously, I gave the book a try (thanks to my public library) and I was very pleasantly surprised. <br />Ms. Lawson writes about food as if she is writing you a personal letter from her kitchen. She really does make the food sound attractive and &quot;lures&quot; you into baking something. . . anything! In addition, as a mother, I was extremely impressed at how often she talks about her daughter(s) and the joy she has with them in the kitchen - that was great to read. Most of the baking is divine. However, the cooking (savory) section is a bit too Brit for my taste; our family just doesn't eat that kind of food, but if you like that kind of stuff I'm sure you'd enjoy her recipes. <br />I am purchasing this book for myself for Christmas simply because those cupcakes and Madeira cake (without Maderia!) sound just too delicious to pass up.	2002-11-30

Ms. Garten presents a lovely cookbook and has good ideas for atmosphere, music, etc. But sadly, this book misses the mark. I feel her other books were better and I use many, many  recipes from them. There are very few recipes we will be using - the Chicken Soup looks delicious.<br />Maybe she's taken on too much with the Oprah monthly articles, her store, touring, etc. I live on the East End of Long Island, not far from The Barefoot Contessa and I don't want to sound mean, but I feel this book could have been a better.	2002-10-30

We make a brunch each and every Sunday and have a great time. Of course there is always a sweet bread/coffee cake and most of the time it comes from this book or the author's other book: Breakfast Breads - which I also highly recommend.<br />Who wouldn't want to wake up to the smell of homemade bread (even if it's quick bread) and fresh coffee?<br />I hope you enjoy it as much we do!	2002-09-19

Enjoy!	2002-09-19

However, there were many recipes that our family just would not utilize. Also, there should have been more pie recipes.<BR>His homemade version of jellied cranberry sauce is delicious and there are definately other \\"keepers\\" that you don't have to wait for the holidays for.<BR>I got this book at the library and I am purchasing it through Amazon for this year's holiday - for the turkey information alone, it is well worth it.	2002-08-14

This is a very good cookbook, but not for the average cook on an &quot;everyday&quot; budget. But then, of course, Martha's tv shows are not for us either. Anyways, there are many good recipes, and I like Martha's shows and have her other books. But, in my opinion, her Comfort Foods Cookbook was her finest hour.	2002-06-07

I received this book as a Christmas gift in December of 1998 and have not stopped reading it since. Trust me, this is not an exaggeration. I began it on 1/1/1999 and it became such a part of my daily life that I started right back on it for 2000, 2001 and now 2002, and you know what?, I'm still finding new things each time. Sarah will help you branch off into other areas that you don't even know exist in you. She has opened the door for me for new authors and (gasp!) reading mysteries (which I NEVER thought I'd like). I hope if you buy this or receive it as a gift that you get as much enjoyment out of it as I have. Good luck and Godspeed!	2002-06-06

I am having the same difficulty trying to really like this book. I have been a fan of Stephen King's for 24 years and have read every one of his books. This is not one of his better ones.<br />First of all, this is not the Talisman, it is after the fact and as fans, we do not want to believe that life goes on and changes. Well, guess what? it does and there are some things that us, as readers, are just not going to like in this book, but. . .<br />Anyways, you've gotta read the Talisman first (GREAT book) and then you can read this. Also, reading the Gunslinger series is a recommendation because they are ALL tied in which is a nice thing.<br />They will eventually make this a mini-series as I hear they are doing with Talisman. I just hope they get a great actor for Wolf.	2001-10-09

I received this book one day after it hit the streets, and have made several recipes so far. The Sour Cream Coffee Cake is great, and when my family sees me paging through either this or Ms. Garten's first cookbook, they anticipate a wonderful dinner. Definately try the Chinese Chicken Salad  :) <br />I live approximately 40 minutes from the Barefoot Contessa store, and will definately be checking it out very soon!<br />Thank you Ina Garten!	2001-04-26

This book is filled with wonderful goodies to make, however, I did note a few typos in the book. The authors or the publishers fault? Who's to say, but this book is definately not a Baking 101 book. <br />If you know your way around the kitchen and a cookbook, you can get through it okay. I have made several of the recipes (I have  baking experience) and I must say, they can be hit or miss. I must also must agree with one reviewer: the oatmeal cookies were awful. But, several others (including the chocolate cake, cheesecakes, and magic cookie bars) were wonderful! <br />Yes, if these authors write another cookbook I will check it out. Hope this review helped.	2001-04-26

Beautifully written, this book had me longing for some new traditions in our household, and since receiving a used copy about a year ago, I have started. Though my daughter is 15 years old, some of the things we can still do. An added plus: there is lots and lots of Victoriana history that I never knew. This book would make a great baby shower gift for the new mom. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br />Thank you Sarah! P.S.  If you haven't already, buy her Simple Abundance Book - it has changed my life!	2001-04-12
