This book is nothing but tips, so you don't have to wade through long tutorials or read about the theory of vectors to get what you want. <br /> <br />Since it is only tips, you need to know at least the basics of using Illustrator to put the information to work. <br /> <br />These are great tips.  Some, I never expected, such as how to grab the \\"Twist\\" tool from your copy of Illustrator 10 and import it into Illustrator CS.  It seems that in their infinite wisdom, Adobe developers decided to remove it from the Tool Palette in CS and make it a pull down menu where you have to enter a numerical value. Many of  us prefer to chose the tool from the palette and apply the twist or twirl visually, rather than have to guess what numerical value will give the results we want. <br /> <br />There are wonderful tips on editing PDF files, how to make a fraction, put type on a circle, rotate individual characters, create evenly spaced tabs, create colored text and text boxes, switch between Type and Selection Tools quickly, reveal hidden objects in your drawing, and more. <br /> <br />I particularly liked the tip on how to smooth lines you are drawing by holding down the Option key as you draw. And, as someone who prefers keyboard commands, I appreciated the section at the front that tells you how to customize your own, as well as the hidden keyboard commands discussed at the end of the book. And, the section on making customized Arrowheads comes in handy. <br /> <br />Until I read this, I had no idea there was a Symbolism chooser. (Hold Command + Option as you click and hold on any Symbolism tool and a Chooser pops up with all the choices.)   <br /> <br />And who knew you could get Illustrator to calculate complex transformations for you? Say you want to create a box that is exactly 3 inches square and apply a 12 point stroke. Illustrator applies the stroketo the center of the line, giving you 6 points outside the line on each side. In the Transform palette, you can tell it to make the box 3 inches minus 12 points, so your box will end up exactly 3 inches square, including the stroke. There are two tips on page 74 that explain it well. <br /> <br />If you already know how to do basic Illustrator tasks, or even if you are an advanced user, this book holds lots of little gems for  you.	2005-01-07

As such, each chapter in the book is a Lesson. Early lessons cover topices such as \\"General Troubleshooting Theory,\\" and \\"Safe Working Procedures and General Maintenance.\\" <br /> <br />Lessons 5 through 10 cover common hardware and technologies, including basic computer theory , underlying technologies, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), wired networking and wireless networking. <br /> <br />If you are a person who likes to do your own upgrading and maintenance of your Mac, you'll find this book very helpful. Likewise, if you want to make your living taking apart Macs and replacing parts as repair or upgrade. <br /> <br />This book does not cover Operating Systems.  If you want to solve a problem in OS 9 or OS X, you need a different book. But, if you want to see the \\"Take-Aparts\\" for certain Mac models, including iMacs, iBooks, mini-towers and PowerBooks, this is for you. Both CRT-based and Flat-Panel based computers are covered. <br /> <br />There is a good section on how to search the AppleCare knowledge base, and doing advanced searches. They recommend you bookmark Apple Knowledge Base document 75178, as it gives good info on how to use keywords to search the Knowledge Base. And another section on locating Apple replacement parts. <br /> <br />The main reason this book has over 800 pages is the copious amount of photos. They support the step-by -step instructions for installing or replacing hard drives, optical drives, RAM, Airport Cards, etc. <br /> <br />I'm glad I got this book, as it will be useful when I want to upgrade the hard drive on our G4 flat-panel iMac and add a second hard drive to my G5 desktop. <br /> <br />Apple states in the beginning of the book, \\"Whether you are an experienced technician or someone who just wants to dig deep into a Macintosh, you'll find in-depth technical service information as well as a comprenhensive overview of the service tools and procedures used by AppleCare-certified technicians to diagnose, upgrade and maintain Macintosh computers.\\"	2005-01-07

I love this book! <br /> <br />This book is the most complete book on the topic that I've seen so far. I've read a dozen books on script writing and story development and another half dozen on film making.  Sheridan has created a one-stop resource. (I realize my previous study may have prepped me to \\"get\\" everything in this book.) <br /> <br />You can use this book to create any kind of film, be it \\"real action\\" shot with a dv camera, or  animation or any combination of the two. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three parts, and each part has several chapters.  As each chapter  addresses a topic, there are \\"exercises\\" and \\"projects\\" to help you learn the topic lessons and develop your first film as you go through the book. <br /> <br />Part I is \\"Digital Storytelling.\\" She starts out by covering how to come up with ideas for a film story. Her exercises will take you through brainstorming and writing to come up with several story ideas. Then she goes in depth with original characters, themes and metaphors, including all of the elements that make a good character, how to develop a character \\"arc.\\" She explains what a theme in a film is and how to develop visual metaphors that define characters. Part I ends with a great section on plot points and how to add twists, turns and surprise to your plot to keep it interesting. <br /> <br />In Part II, she shows you how to use the three-act structure, create scenes and write a script. The CD-ROM includes a demo copy of Movie Magic Screenwriter that is fully functional and doesn't expire for producing short (40-pages or less). If you follow her steps, you will end up with a script. <br /> <br />Once you have your script, she tells you how to shoot it, how to make your shot choices, frame shots, and get the eye to go where you want it in a scene. I was really impressed with the section on how to design the color palette for your film to create the mood you want. <br /> <br />Thebook winds up with editing, making the editing choices, adding in special effects, sound effects, titles, etc. The CD-ROM also includes demo versions of Adobe After Effects (see my review on page 7) and Sonic Fire Pro. You can use the latter to add music to your film. After going through this book, I wanted to be like the kids in the old 40s movies - \\"Hey, kids, lets make a movie!\\"	2004-11-04

After Effects is, by its very nature, a more advanced application for creating video than, say iMovie. That's because After Effects is a \\"motion graphics\\" program with far more features than basic video editing. I think of it as Photoshop with motion and a timeline. <br /> <br />However, if you are a beginner at After Effects, this book can still work for you if you start with the early chapters first. <br /> <br />Bolante does a good job of giving you an overview of After Effects' interface, palettes, and the workflow. He moves on to how to create, open and close projects, including how to choose your settings and change them. <br /> <br />Next is importing files, how to import still images, image sequences, files with alpha channels, footage, etc. He also tells you how to loop footage and remove film pulldown. If you don't know what that is, look at page 60 for a few pages of good explanation. <br /> <br />The chapter on Managing Footage does a nice job of helping you organize your footage and understand how to view it. (Do you know about action-safe and title-safe areas?) <br /> <br />Like Photoshop, After Effects works in layers (with the addition of audio layers), and Bolante gives you the skinny on creating, naming, hiding, showing and rasterizing them. Editing is all about manipulating the layers by trimming, moving, sequencing, overlapping, splitting, changing the layer's speed, etc. <br /> <br />Motion Graphics is all about adding images, motion, changes in size, transparency, blending modes and more. Most of it is done with keyframes. Chapter 7 gives the ins and outs of keyframing. There is a big chapter on masking. Like Photoshop, you use masks to bled various images together. But, you begin, end, rotate, change, scale, show and hide them over time. He covers it all. <br /> <br />Special effects are the \\"magic\\" part of After Effects, so Bolante devotes a couple of chapters to their intricacies. There are also chapters on creating and animating text, painting on layers, keyframe interpolation (advanced layer techniques), integrating 3D layers, managing complex projects, and, of course, outputting your movies. All-in-all, it is a very thorough book for both Mac and PC users.	2004-11-04

Even so, This one was better than I expected.  <br /> <br />Katrin has designed the book so it could be used as a textbook for Photoshop teachers. There are files to go with the book and its lessons available for download over the internet. You can use these files to do the lesson projects she has throughout the book. This was true with her book on photo restoration and retouching, as well. <br /> <br />As the title suggests, she gives excellent information on making masks in Photoshop. She gives you the theory, so you can better understand how masks work, and then gives you lots of techniques for creating masks. <br /> <br />Often, masks are required to extract a person or an object from the background of a photo, so you can composite it into another photo. She gives excellent tutorials on doing this, including how to preserve hair and fine detail. We all know how much more real a composite looks when you are able to capture those stray hairs. It's all about selecting those fine details with out selecting the unwanted stuff. She gives you several selection strategies that you can use in different situations. <br /> <br />She also gives you strategies for using the pen tool to create complex paths and combine paths. And there is a selection technique called the \\"multi-pass\\" technique (page 300). <br /> <br />In the compositing section, she devotes the first part to image execution, showing you how to design your photo shots for compositing. And gives some good advice in \\"Photographic Essentials.\\" <br /> <br />I was blown away by a project she showed in which some books were composited in with buildings, matching perspective to make them fit perfectly. See page 416 for the final result, and read the pages preceding it to see how it was done. I was even more impressed with another project that begins on page 431. In that project, there is an ordinary photo of two people fencing in the woods at a medieval faire. The end of the project results in a dramatic photo with beautiful lighting. <br /> <br />She also covers alternatives for achieving results, such as sharpening a photo with High Pass instead of Unsharp Mask. This is a great book for someone who wants to improve their Photoshop skills. You probably should be an intermediate level user, able to understand all of the basics of Photoshop if you want to use this book.	2004-11-04

Many folks think that, because they are the \\"simple or basic\\" programs, that they don't have a lot of features or can't do professional looking movies.<br /><br />The fact is, you can get VERY nice results with these applications.  There was a fellow who won a prize at Sundance Film Festival for a movie he made entirely with a cheap miniDV camera and iMovie. If you have budding aspirations as a filmmaker, or you just want to video a birthday party or wedding, you can get great results, too.<br /><br />Jeff Carlson's book is aimed at beginner-to-intermediate users. It takes a visual, step-by-step approach. Everything is explained well and accompanied by  lots of photos.<br /><br />I was really pleased to see that he devotes the first 50 pages of the book to explaining how to use the DV camera, including how to take good video to start out with. He covers focus, depth-of-field, lighting, composing your shots, how and when to move the camera, etc. The term \\"garbage-in-garbage-out\\" was invented for computers, but it is really true with video and photography, as well.<br /><br />Part 2 covers iMovie in logical order. He starts with an overview, then tells you how to import footage, edit video, edit still pictures for video, edit audio. He pays nice attention to the audio portion, including how to adjust the audio that came with the video, adding sound effects, music from iTunes and GarageBand, and adding audio from other sources. He also covers transitions, adding titles and making them look good on-screen, and adding visual effects to the movie.<br /><br />Carlson calls Part 3 \\"Sharing.\\" He tells you how to get your finished movie back to video tape or export it in other formats, such as QuickTime. Depending on the QuickTime compression scheme, you can put your movie on a CD, the web or send it via e-mail. And ... of course, you can send it to iDVD, complete with chapter markers.<br /><br />Part 4tells  you everything you need to know to make a DVD. He tells you how to apply themes, customize them, create sub-menus, add chapters to an existing iDVD project, and creating slide shows with background audio. Then, he shows you how to create a project archive and burn the DVD. He finishes up with a chapter on troubleshooting.	2004-11-04

So I expected to like this one, too. I wasn't disappointed, but not for the reasons I expected. (I thought this was a Photoshop CS book.)    It starts out explaining the set-up for your digital camera and the best workflow from camera to finished product. There are several pages on Camera Raw adjustments. And they tell you how to adjust your exposure settings on your camera to get an optimal picture to start with.    For most of the book, it is somewhat like a cookbook, with recipes to achieve the various effects and perform the various feats of magic on the photos.    The CD contains all of the photos used in all of the projects in the book, so you can do what they do and follow along. They strongly suggest in the book that you perform the tasks in chapters 1 & 2 before moving on to any of the others. These are the lessons that give you a foundation of skills and techniques to build on. After that, they say you are free to roam and work through their projects (recipes) in any order.    You'll also find over 250 custom presets on the CD. A bunch of them are used in the projects throughout the book. The others are there for you to browse at your leisure. The presets are:    ACTIONS for everything from enhancing and fixing photos to automating tasks like noise removal.  CUSTOM SHAPE TOOLS to help you create instant and elaborate framing, soft-edged vignettes, ghosted backgrounds, etc.  NATURAL MEDIA BRUSH TOOLS for use in creating expressive chalk and oil border treatments or turning your photos into water color paintings.  SEAMLESSLY WRAPPING PATTERNS ranging from paper and canvas texture to  fabric and woven materials, all of which can be applied with a single click.    Even though it was written for \\"Adobe Photoshop 7 or later,\\" it covers some features that are new to Photoshop CS (8), such as the Lens Blur filter and the new Shadow/Highlight feature under Image ->Adjustments.     Almost all the stuff in this book can be accomplished with Photoshop 7.  About 85% - 90% can be performed with Photoshop 6.	2004-09-03

I grabbed the iLife Suite,  <br />installed GarageBand, and quickly discovered that this \\"simple\\" program  <br />was beyond my abilities. <br /> <br />I didn't really understand the difference between a tempo and a time  <br />signature. I told you - musically challenged. Victor Gavenda explains  <br />it on pages 32 - 33. He goes on to talk about choosing a key and why  <br />you might choose certain ones. After reading this, I am no longer  <br />intimidated by the prospect of setting up a song. <br /> <br />He does a great job of covering all of the other elements of the  <br />interface. I now know the difference between a track and a region, and  <br />between Real Instrument Tracks and Software Instrument Tracks. Gavenda  <br />explains the color coding for these and tells you how to add, delete,  <br />select, mute or solo a track. <br /> <br />There is thorough info on music loops and Apple Loops in particular. He  <br />explains that Apple Loops contain \\"metadata\\" that GarageBand reads and  <br />sorts them into categories in the Loop Browser. If you want to use the  <br />Button View to find loops, it uses the metadata there, too. Until I  <br />read page 67, I didn't realize you could customize Button View. You can  <br />move or change keywords on buttons and expand the Loop Browser to show  <br />more buttons. <br /> <br />After reading the section on adding loops to your song, I now  <br />understand why I couldn't see all of the loops I knew I had. I needed  <br />to start out with a time signature of 4/4 if I was going to build a  <br />composition mostly from loops. Given my musical skills, I have to build  <br />mine entirely from loops. <br /> <br />There is a nice section on hardware for recording audio, and hardware  <br />for software instruments. He tells you what you need to consider and  <br />what features to look for. It is followed by a section on recording  <br />software instruments and re-recording a section of a song. <br /> <br />In later chapters, he shows how to select, copy, move, resize, loop,  <br />split and join regions. Until I read chapter 8, I didn't realize that  <br />every item you put in the song is a region.) There are tips for adding  <br />effects and doing advanced editing, too. <br /> <br />If this book can help a musical whiz (not) like myself, it can surely  <br />help you.	2004-09-03

Some beginners may be intimidated by its sheer size and weight. But, if you want thorough coverage of Photoshop CS, how to set it up, use it, tweak it and troubleshoot problems with it, then this is the book for you. <br /> <br />I was surprised that they started out by telling you how to build your \\"Photoshop System.\\" They give advice on choosing your platform, and what you need in terms of horsepower (GHz), OS, RAM, etc. They go on to give advice on upgrading to CS and tell you what's new. (And they tell you where to find some \\"Easter Eggs.\\") <br /> <br />At page 555 they continue the \\"set-up\\" theme with sections on capturing images and building a digital workflow. \\"Capturing\\" covers digital cameras, scanners and photo CDs, with good advice on how to get the best image capture into Photoshop. \\"Building a Digital Workflow\\" explains the essentials of \\"Camera Raw,\\" metadata and the File Browser to manage you photos. (If you're trying to capture b/w line art, it's better to scan as a high res grayscale and then use sharpening and threshold.) <br /> <br />They do a good job at explaining bitmaps vs. vectors, and how resampling or changing image modes affects your document. (You should use \\"Bicubic Smoother\\" for upsampling and \\"Bicubic Sharper\\" for downsampling.) <br /> <br />Since Bruce Fraser is co-author, the 100+ pages on color theory and management are excellent. (There are over 60 more pages on color correction, 50 more pages on spot color and duotones and yet another 50 additional pages on tonal correction.) If you buy this book, you don't need an additional book on color management. <br /> <br />I personally got a lot out of Chapter 10, which covers sharpening. It gave me a better understanding of how it works and how to do a better job when retouching photos. I plan to re-visit page 626 when I need to convert color images to grayscale. And page 636 has a technique to use the clone tool and stroked paths to automate removal of powerlines, long scratches, etc.! <br /> <br />Of course, they cover more stuff, like getting more detail in shadows, text and typography, photomerge hidden features, and how to apply those nifty filters and effects.	2004-09-03

(Photoshop comes with a powerful application for making image maps, animated GIFs, rollovers for the web, etc. Chapters 14 - 18 cover Image Ready and its Photoshop features.)<BR> <BR>It tells you how to use the automated features for output. You can create a PDF presentation from the File Browser, save photos into a Web Gallery, make a Photo Package or a Contact Sheet.<br />Lesson 6 is all about masking and its many variations, such as gradient masks. Hidden in this chapter is the Extract command, showing you how to extract an image from its background.<br />It covers retouching and repairing photos, painting and editing, which includes blending images into a background and use of the History Palette.<br />Advanced layer techniques (Lesson 11) include creating clipping paths, adjustment layers, knock-out masks, importing layers from other files, using the liquify tool and more.<br />ThereÕs even a pretty good discussion of Camera Raw (page 64) and the stuff you should know about it.	2004-05-06

She seems to have a new title out every couple of weeks. This is Ms. Williams' second offering of this title.    I have long said that the best thing about DeskTop Publishing is that it puts it in the hands of everybody and the worst thing about DeskTop Publishing is that it puts it in the hands of everybody. Some people just don't have an eye for design.    The fact is, because of DeskTop Publishing, many people with no formal training in publishing or design end up having to design something. They find they must create an advertisement, a newsletter, a brochure, a business card or a poster. Panic sets in for those who have no idea where to start, or don't understand the fundamentals of good design.     If any of this sounds familiar to you, The Non-Designer's Design Book is your \\"rescue in a book.\\" I really like the many before and after examples she shows of web pages, brochures, business cards, etc. There is an amazing example of a tri-fold brochure before and after on pages 106-107, and a newspaper ad on pages 114-115.    She explains the use of typography very nicely, and explains when to use different kinds of typefaces. (Did you know that most people make the type on their home made business cards too big?)    This book is not a big, heavy tome that goes on forever on its topics. That's a good thing. It keeps things simple and easy to understand. Each topic is covered well and in an interesting manner.	2004-05-06

I constantly recommend the books to folks who want to get up to speed on Adobe's software. So ... I come to this review slightly prejudiced. However, I must say I've never met anyone who didn't think they were good.     The thing I like best about Adobe's CIB series is that it is truly a tutorial, not just a reference book.    If you will take a little time and do the lessons in the book in order, you'll learn all the basic (and some beyond) skills that you need.  The included CD-ROM contains all the files you need to do the tutorials.    My first three years of web-site design involved hand-coding everything, Now days, you can use a handy tool to diagram (make a visual plan) your site. Making the diagram automatically generates the basic pages to be included in the site!    Its organization is a very logical, step-by-step progression. It covers the basics, and some very advanced features. From basic web page design, to floating boxes, animations, rollovers, cascading style sheets (one of my weak areas), drop down menus, javascript, and site management, it covers it thoroughly. I really like components (things you design once and use on many pages of the site).    If you are trying to learn GoLive in order to build  web presence, this book will be a GREAT help. Just work through the tutorials, and you'll learn it. (It certainly beats paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for training.)	2004-05-06

He can produce images that look like photos, even though no photo was used.<br />All of the examples in the book are from actual projects. This is a BIG book. The pages are about 10 X 10 and full of color photos of each step in the various projects he shows.  The large size is more suitable for sowing the step-by-step examples, but I found it slightly unwieldy. <br />He is very complete in his explanations, so that even someone with only modest Photoshop skills should be able to follow along easily.<br />He shows several photo quality images he created from scratch for a magazine.  He says he creates realities in Photoshop. I was in awe of the shiny chrome-plated shower handle in a bathroom scene, the reflection in a water puddle on a path he created next to grass and bushes he created, the glow of the light bulb he made and the textures he created for a stucco wall and marble floor.<br />Monroy also show several projects in which he composited many images together for amazing results. It gave me some inspiration to do some projects on my own. He explains it very well. There is even an explanation of how an alpha channel works.<br />And there are examples of re-touching and correcting images in order for them to be used in advertisements and magazines. His attention to detail is phenomenal. (Perhaps it is due to his 20 years experience as an art director with a New York City Ad Agency.)	2004-05-06

From the title, I expected to find advice on preparing images for the screen, how to put them on a CD or DVD, etc. Those things are there, but the book begins in a logical place that I wouldn't have considered. Brown's approach is truly holistic.    Check out page 23 for the first page of a three-page self assessment check list. It has you evaluate your professional strengths and weaknesses, goals and personality.     Chapter 3 asks you a bunch of questions to help you identify who your audience really is and focus on them.     The rest of the book covers various digital formats, how to organize your work, how to get images of 3D and oversized work into your portfolio, including choosing a camera and setting up for shooting.    Ms. Brown covers editing your images to remove the most common problems, such as moire, sharpening needs, bad crops, etc. And ... she devotes a section to creating written content to accompany your stunning images, telling you how to write to that audience you defined earlier.    She explains the differences between a monitor screen and a printed page.  You need to know that to design the correct interface for your portfolio. She also has a full chapter devoted to marketing and copyright issues.    The entire book is scattered with quotes (in friendly green type) from experts and those who have gone before you. The quotes tell you what agencies are looking for in a portfolio, how others have found success at this, what things you can do to streamline the process, etc.	2004-05-06

He says he trashed every technique from the Photoshop 7 version and started from scratch with this one.<br />I really like the layout of it. It's like two books in one. The pages are white with tan vertical strips almost two inches wide. In the white sections are the step-by-step, how-to instructions, with plenty of images that show the progress of each step. The tan sidebars contain Quick Tips.<br />I love the one on page 74. It says, \\"Want some cool metal gradients? You've already got `em!\\" Then it goes on to explain how to access them.<br />There are some really cool lessons, such as the one on popping out of a photo on page 23, Edge Collage technique on page 39, the one on making a filmstrip template on page 192, and the one on how to make a photo cube on page 230. There are multiple lessons on different 3-D effects, lots of cool type effects, and Advertising effects, like fancy product shot backgrounds, adding a window to another place and dividing a photo into puzzle pieces.<br />This book is fine for beginners, as the first time he has you do a new task, like create a layer, he tells in detail how to do it. But he doesn't tell you how to do it in every lesson, so the more advanced folks won't get bogged down and bored. And the Quick Tips in the sidebars alone are worth the price of the book.	2004-01-30

But, if you don't have the time or money to take a class,  you can work through this book yourself.<br />All materials and files for the lessons in the book are included on the CD (except, of course, for the application itself). You'll need to copy all the files from the CD to your hard drive and work with them from there, in order to make the changes to them as you work through the lessons.<br />Before you get to Lesson 1, there is \\"A Quick Tour of Adobe Illustrator,\\" an interactive demo that gives you an overview of the key features of Illustrator cs. You actually use one of the art files on the CD and follow along with the book to try some features. The book says it takes about an hour.<br />This books will help you discover that even though Illustrator keeps adding more features, it is actually easier to use than it used to be.  There are lessons on drawing with the pen tool, painting, working with type, working with brushes and scribbles, using the airbrush features, transforming objects, using the 3-D Effect (!), printing artwork and color separations, and combining Illustrator graphics with Photoshop images, and more.<br />Every lesson begins with a list of what you'll learn in the lesson, exactly which files from the CD you'll need to use and how to set up the document(s) you'll use in the lesson. From there, it has very clear lessons. You'll definitely learn how to use Illustrator if you follow this book.	2004-01-30

It is more for the person who wants to do professional photography and/or serious retouching of photos for publications.  Troche, aka the Glitterguru, gives diagrams on lighting set-ups for photo shoots and LOTS of info on retouching photos, including color photos for each example.<br />The author goes into detail about how freelancers get contracts for and produce images for various purposes. The chapter on pre-production tells you how to nail down the concept, create a shot list, gather your team, cast a model, get props, get storyboards to crew, doing lighting set-ups and test shots, etc. Sounds kind of like making a movie.<br />She also has a chapter of advice on how to deliver your finished product to clients. (RGB or CMYK, print or digital, etc.) And, there's a good section on the business of photography and digital imaging. It covers marketing, estimating a job, copyright issues and more. There is even information on how to deal with art directors and other creative types.<br />Suzette has a significant on-line presence at [...] You can find examples from the book on there.<br />If you are starting out in the business of photography or editing digital images, or are just thinking about it, this would be a good book to read. It will give you a look at what's involved, and advice on how to make money in the business.	2004-01-30

All of the lesson files for the training are on the included DVD-ROM. Upon completing the course material in this book, you can become a certified Apple Pro by taking the certification exam at an apple Authorized Training Center. If you had to pay for classes to get certified, you would pay thousands of dollars, so this is a great bargain for those who are motivated to follow the book's course.<br />You don't have to be on the path to certification to use this book. If you're a hobbyist, beginner or pro who wants to learn more about Final Cut Pro 4, its all in here.<br />The book begins by explaining the Final Cut Pro interface including the projects, bins, timeline and canvas. It tells you how to open, hide and quit FCP.<br />There are chapters on marking and editing clips, editing in the timeline, trimming,  master clips, subclips and markers. There are chapters on capturing video, importing and exporting, working with audio, mixing audio tracks, and creating a music soundtrack.<br />Toward the end are the chapters on adding filters, building composite images, creating motion effects, adding text and graphics, and creating an animated title. The last chapter is on finishing and outputting. Each chapter builds logically on what came before.<br />Each chapter begins with a section called \\"Preparing the Project.\\" It tells you what to open on your desktoop and in what order to be able to do that lesson. They all end with a section called \\"What You Have Learned.\\" That section lists the specific tasks in the chapter and all of the keyboard shortcuts associated with those tasks.

Kvern and Blatner cover all of the basics you would expect; page layout, text controls, type characteristics, drawing, transparency, importing, exporting, color, printing, etc.<br />But it's the depth at which they are able to cover each area that is astounding. Anyone who has used InDesign 2 knows it has a zillion palettes and tools. This book covers them all in great detail. I venture to say that you would be hard pressed to come up with a question about InDesign 2 that this book doesn't cover.<br />And they put their money where their collective mouth is. They laid out the entire 650 page book using InDesign 2. One of them used a Titanium Powerbook running OS X and the other used Windows. A nice demo of its true cross-platform capabilities.<br />I was particularly impressed by how they showed the differences in results you get when performing a task (such as transforming the contents within a path), depending on which options are selected.  This is the best reference book on InDesign I've seen. I like the Adobe Classroom in a Book, but wouldn't use it as my handy reference on how to do some little obscure thing.<br />I didn't realize how powerful the drawing tools in InDesign are until I read this book. And I didn't understand the difference between downsampling and subsampling (for exporting as a PDF), but they explain it well. <br />There is a nice section on managing long documents, their tables of contents and indices.	2003-10-22

They start with some color theory, but don't bog down on the technical, like some other books I've seen. <br />They explain the color management and profile process, then tell you how to build profiles for various devices. They spend six (!) chapters on building and editing profiles. There are separate chapters for measurement &amp; calibration, displays, input devices, output devices, etc. As an example, they cover the steps and procedures to profile RGB inkjet printers, CMYK inkjets, CMYK color lasers, CMYK solid inks, Dye-sub printers, and much more.<br />That process has always seemed like a bunch of mumbojumbo to me, but I found their explanations to be easy to follow.  They explain the need for the right lighting in the room where you proof and print and how color shifts can occur.<br />Then, they deal with applications and workflow. Chapter twelve covers the Adobe Color architecture. subsequent chapters deal with separate apps like Freehand, Corel Draw, QuarkXPress and PDF. <br />They explain Colorsync and ICM color management systems. And there is a nice discussion about WHEN  in the process to convert the color profile of an image.<br />The appendices have some very useful info on profiles and workflows.<br />It's a bit pricey, but if you NEED color management, it is worth it.	2003-10-22

While that may be true, I found all of the explanations in the book to be very simple and step-by-step, so that advanced beginners or intermediate users should be able to follow along easily.<br />Author Scott Kelby, Photoshop User magazine editor, shows you the Photoshop pros' techniques for managing, correcting, retouching and outputting your photos to produce brilliant results. This book is great for traditional photographers who are making the jump to digital photography. Reading it should empower you to experiment with your photos. <br />The full color book is packed with graphics and tutorials that will show you how to  re-size your images with the proper resolution without losing image quality, deal with High ISO noise, blue channel noise, and other common digital camera problems. There's good info on color correcting photos for output on everything from inkjet printers to printing presses, and how to get perfect fleshtones. I love the &quot;digital plastic surgery&quot; and facial retouching techniques using Photoshop 7.0's new tools. <br />Plus, some great exercises in masking, digital dodging and burning tricks, colorizing hair and replacing a portion of a pic (such as a sky).	2003-09-26

That aside, this book seems just right for the amateur digital photographers who want to make big improvements in their photos. Scott starts at the beginning - with the File Browser - showing you how to organize and find your photos on your computer.<br />From there, he shows you how to size, crop and straighten a photo. Then, it's on to correcting over and under exposures, adding a fill flash and correcting red eye. There's an excellent section on color correcting photos (he makes it amazingly easy!) Masking isn't just for Photoshop. Scott shows you step-by-step how to use masks to make selections.<br />I was surprised to find sections on how to repair and restore damaged photos, along with professional photo retouching secrets. And there is a great section on digital plastic surgery and body sculpting. Chapter 8 covers the most-requested photographic special effects, including:  adding motion, creating depth of field, using color for emphasis, sepia tone, creating montages, replacing the sky, and making a panorama pic.<br />This book should expand your skills with Elements so you get more out of it than you thought possible.	2003-09-26

About 95% of the time, my answer was there. Well, Mac OS X Disaster Relief is the OS X equivalent. And this updated version includes a \\"special Jaguar supplement,\\" dedicated to solving problems in OS X 10.2.<br />I noticed on Amazon.com, that they mention the third edition of this book due out in September of 2003.  I wonder if it will contain info on \\"Panther,\\" OS X 10.3, which is supposed to be released around that time?<br />Many of you may know Ted as the creator of the MacFixit web site. In Mac OS X Disaster Relief, he covers the gamut from how to solve common problems, to rare ones, to geeky things like editing your preferences files to turn off blinking cursors.  Or make files invisible (or vice versa). Though this is definitely an OS X book, he does tell you how to troubleshoot a few OS 9 things that may affect your OS X. <br />He devotes some pages to solving OS X crashes, and to the various disk repair utilities like Drive 10, Norton Utilities, etc. Interestingly, he seems to think it is safe to use Norton Speed Disk to optimize your hard drive (page 255). He also explains that this kind of optimization is entirely different from the kind of optimization that happens as part of an installation of software.<br />There is also a good section on internet and network troubleshooting. In that section, I think I may have found a solution I've been looking for. AppleTalk does not work when it is active on multiple ports (page 471). That may explain why I'm having trouble printing over ethernet.<br />In one section, he talks about backing up your OS X boot volume using `ditto,' an app built into OS X. He further explains that Carbon Copy Cloner is just a GUI front end for ditto, for those who don't want to use the Terminal. And he tells you about other apps like `psync' that will do the same thing.<br />This book tells you how to do a lot ofvery basic troubleshooting. If you want to get under the hood and dink around (technical term), customize, or troubleshoot at a deeper level, it will help you do that, too.	2003-05-15

I constantly recommend the books to folks who want to get up to speed on Adobe's software. So ... I come to this review slightly prejudiced. Just wanted to get that out of the way up front.<br />The thing I like best about Adobe's CIB series is that it is truly a tutorial, not just a reference book. (Though you can use it as a reference quite easily.)<br />If you will take a little time and do the lessons in the book in order, you'll learn all the basic (and some beyond) skills that you need.  The included CD-ROM contains all the files you need to do the tutorials.<br />I'm working through the GoLive 6 CIB myself. I've used GoLive since a pretty early edition, but it seems that Adobe changes the workings of GoLive considerably with each new edition and I have been neglecting my web sites for quite some time, so I've forgotten how some things work. Adobe GoLive 6.0 Classroom in a Book is exactly what I needed.<br />There is a very logical, step-by-step progression to its organization. It covers the basics, and some very advanced features. From basic web page design, to floating boxes, animations, rollovers, cascading style sheets (one of my weak areas), drop down menus, javascript, and site management, it covers it thoroughly.<br />If you are trying to learn GoLive in order to build yourself some web presence, this book will be a GREAT help. Just work through the tutorials, and you'll learn it. (It certainly beats paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for training.)	2003-05-15

You really don't have to read anything, but I suggest reading the part where it explains resolution (all theirs are done at 225 ppi) and how to get the best results, how to scale their presets, etc.<br />The book contains what seems like a zillion (technical term) sample images of the various styles, presets, patterns and brushes, gradient effects, photo effects... vignettes, frames, borders, tints, color effects, textures, patterns, grains and even various darkroom effects<br />You can set some text or create a simple grayscale image, then click on one of their presets, and voila! You instantly have results that might have taken hours.<br />They also give you presets to change the look of photos, like adding film grain, and, near the back, Jack includes a little tutorial on his amazing technique to turn your photos into paintings (using the brush presets on the CD).	2003-05-15

The largest part of the book is dedicated to dark room techniques, but a good part of the book covers such things as getting the best scans, creating effects, saving for the web, making half-tones, etc.<br />They cover lots of issues that help me understand WHY I might want to do something a certain way. Such as, the differences between RGB, CMYK and LAB color. When I bring a digital photo into Photoshop, I almost always feel a need to adjust it, fix the levels, etc. Fooling with the levels usually causes a color shift. To avoid that, they explain how to change the mode from RGB to LAB color, and then apply the levels command to the L (luminance) channel, leaving the color untouched. I can change the mode back to RGB afterwards, if I want.<br />In discussing color correction, they talk about fixing the neutrals so the rest will follow and explain that in Photoshop's RGB mode, it automatically calculates the amount of CMYK to produce neutrals, but in CMYK mode, you have to manually fill in the percentages. The section on color correction is incredible.<br />They discuss printing from Photoshop 7, the issue of different file formats and which to use when;  the Rule of 16; which settings take precedence over others, and much more.<br />The book is well laid out, with an easy to follow structure. Several light bulbs spontaneously illuminated for me while reading this book. This book is useful to new Photoshop users and for seasoned photographers who have past experience with Photoshop but like to keep a reference of new features.	2003-05-15

But to my surprise, it covers them and much more. <br />It also covers Mail, Address Book, iCal, iChat and Rendezvous, Safari, Appleworks, Omnigraffle, FaxSTF, Inkwell and all of the .Mac features, including iDisk, iCards, HomePage, WebMail, Backup, iSync, Slides Publisher and Virex. Phew! I'm glad I don't have to say that - I'd run out of breath.<br />I get a lot of questions from people who are converting from other e-mail apps to Mail, so I looked through Chapter 5 (Mail and Address Book) to see if the most common questions were covered. They were. The AppleWorks Chapter (17) is divided into six sections: Word Processing, Database, Spreadsheet, Painting, Drawing, and Presentation. They cover all the basics you need to get started with these tools.<br />Tollett and Williams tell us how to rip CDs, import and edit movies, work with iPhoto, create a chat room in iChat, edit, publish and subscribe to calendars using iCal, make a web location from any link in Safari, publish a slide show on your .Mac account, customize the button bar in AppleWorks, and so much more. the information is presented in simple, logical, straight-forward steps.<br />This book ought to come in the box with every new iMac, eMac and iBook.

Just don't let the size intimidate you. This is one of the best books for beginners of Mac OS X, and the Mac in general!    So ... all you  folks out there thinking of stepping up to OS X, get this book.  It will help you understand what's going on. Ms. Williams covers everything a beginner needs to know, from how the whole \\"users\\" thing works, to organizing your folders, font management, file sharing, all things internet, what the \\"drop box\\" is for, etc.    There are (semi-circle, gray) tabbed pages designated for beginners. Robin gives you easy-to-understand explanations of the Macintosh user interface, including mousing and the keyboard. The beginner pages are sort of a built-in tutorial that not only directs you through the OS and provides exercises to use for practice along the way. There is a quiz at the end of each chapter, to help you understand the key points. The beginner's section ends with a terrific section about how to use the World Wide Web. Check out page 9, where she cleverly shows pics of the Finder menus, with page numbers for the sections that explain every item in the menus.    Page 709 has \\"Where did It Go?\\" for experienced OS 9 users, so you can easily see what replaced the Chooser, etc. I think this should have gone near the front of the book, but its placement is a minor flaw. This is a great Mac OS X beginners tome. What little is missing can be found in a new Peachpit Press book called The Little Mac iApps Book.    Robin sprinkles humor throughout its pages. There is URL, the friendly cartoon rat, who follows you along on your learning journey.      There is a great section on networking. Its a snoozer subject in most books, but Robin makes it simple, providing everyday network settings. What is provided is just enough to get any beginner up and running.    Everything else in the book is called \\"Beyond The Basics.\\" However, Intermediate users will not find any sign of Unix, software gizmos or hacking, minimal troubleshooting, and not much under-the-hood coverage of the OS. She does tell you how to enable root user. I'm glad this book doesn't try to be all things to all users.  There is just too much to know these days to do that.	2003-05-15
