As with the previous installments, you are in for a lot of laughs as Trenton's clumsiest bounty hunter is once again tracking down unseemly folks who have skipped their court dates.  All your favorite characters are back (Morelli, Grandma Mazur, and Lula), but the scene-stealer this time around is the code-cracking drag queen/transvestite/transsexual (Evanovich never quite makes it clear) Sally Sweet.  Sweet is definitely a (much needed) breath of fresh air in this installment.<br />Overall, this is a quick and enjoyable read.  It will not win any literary awards, but heck this is not why we are reading these books anyway.  With the Steph-Morelli relationship taking a turn in &quot;Four,&quot;  I imagine most readers will already be making plans to read the next book well before turning the last page on this one.	2003-10-03

While we may not even think twice about it today, \\"Eden\\" must have been simply scandalous when it was originally published in 1952 with murder, prostitution, and adultery just some of the more \\"adult\\" issues explored in this epic novel.<br />Despite its intimidating length, \\"East\\" moves along quickly as we follow the life of Adam Trask - from his East Coast childhood and troubled relationship with his brother to businessman and father of two sons with equally complex relations of their own.  As the title suggests, the book is a modern retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel story.  As with most of the \\"classics,\\" the novel is rife with topics and themes to deeply delve into and discuss with your book club.  My only criticisms are that the \\"good vs. evil\\" angle gets a bit heavy-handed at times and, for me, the novel loses some steam in the final quarter - but these are certainly not enough to not heartily recommend the work.<br />The nice thing about \\"Eden\\" is if you choose not to take the \\"literary\\" route, you can still be simply entertained and enthralled by Steinbeck's plot and characters.  There is enough suspense and intrigue that make it not terribly different from many of today's bestsellers.	2003-08-12

Admittedly, I was slow out of the gates when it came to reading Laura Hillenbrand's \\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend.\\"  So after endless weeks atop the bestseller list and 300+ glowing reviews here on Amazon, I finally decided to give the book a shot.  Much to my surprise and delight, the book actually lived up to all of its hype and success, a true rarity in my reading experiences of late.  <br />Hillenbrand has fashioned a compulsively readable account of one of the greatest thoroughbred horses of all time as well as three men (owner Charles Howard, trainer Tom Smith, and jockey Red Pollard) who molded the lame-looking animal into a national hero.  Through meticulous research, Hillenbrand masterfully fleshes the main players and events of the day.  With all its drama, suspense, and surprises, \\"Seabiscuit\\" is one of those real-life stories that reads like fiction.<br />So there is probably little more to say, except to add one more voice to this already word-of-mouth bestseller.  It is an inspiring story of reaching beyond what was thought possible to achieve one's dreams - be it man, beast, or even the author herself.	2003-07-03

Overall, I found it to be messy and flashily hip (look all the things I can do!).  Foer's work has been called genius - but as is often said, there is a fine line between genius and insanity.  &quot;Illuminated&quot; is a roller-coaster ride with way too many loops, twists, and turns - not in plot or characters, but literary gimmicks (hair-pulling overuse of italics and indentations and capitalization, parts written like letters, play dialogue, or entries in a reference book, and pages filled with the same phrase repeated dozens/hundreds(?) of times over, etc.).  <br />That said there are pieces (albeit small pieces) of the novel that I found engaging and even entertaining.  There is plenty of humor throughout as well as passages that are simply devastating.  So despite my overall feeling about the novel, there is certainly I hold no doubts that Foer has plenty of talent.  Because of that potential and a hope that he can harness this talent, I will cautiously entertain the idea of reading his second novel.<br />I consider myself a pretty well read person, one who is open for a challenging read, but &quot;Illuminated&quot; simply got to the point where it was an experience to be finished, not enjoyed.	2003-06-20

Stefan Fatsis' \\"Word Freak\\" is a fascinating, if at times intense, look into the world of competitive Scrabble.  As a \\"living room\\" Scrabble player, I looked forward to the insight that the book might give to my game.  What I quickly learned was that I will never be a Scrabble pro - and after reading about those who are, I determined that maybe that is not a bad thing.  To call these players quirky is a huge understatement.  Most have made Scrabble their life quest - traveling to tournaments all around the country (and the world!) and re-programming their brains to the point where words like \\"djinny\\" and \\"elorst\\" jump off their racks for big points.   <br />At first, the inhabitants of the Scrabble sub-culture are endearing, however over the nearly 400 pages of this account, Fatsis' title tag of \\"freak\\" ultimately (and truthfully) rises to the surface.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is the author's own personal journey - from an outsider and Scrabble neophyte (how's that for a word!) to an \\"expert\\" ranked player whose obsession with the game nearly rivals the top pro players.  It is truly a case of the reporter becoming an integral part of the story as Fastis becomes a full-fledged citizen of this peculiar world.  I would guess that this Wall Street Journal sports reporter is still playing competitively these days.  <br />Whether readers who do not have a passing knowledge and interest in Scrabble would enjoy this book is hard to say.  For a Scrabble fan such as myself, even I was overwhelmed at times with the minutiae of tournament life and word play.  Nevertheless, this is a quite entertaining and readable book. That said, I will happily return to the ignorant bliss of amateur Scrabble where ditching a \\"z\\" to spell \\"zoo\\" for a measly 12 points is a cool move.	2003-06-04

So when this National Book Award finalist was chosen as the One Book AZ selection of the year, I thought there was no better time to finally get around to it. But as often seems the case, the anticipation of reading a \\"chosen\\" book only seems to lead to disappointment.  While this is certainly nothing terribly wrong with this \\"slice of life\\" tale of life in a fictional small town in Colorado, Haruf's work just did not do much for me.  Normally I am eager to finish a book  but with just one more sitting left -- it took me nearly a week to find the time to come back and read the closing chapters.  As with most of the book, the \\"plain\\" ending was a bit underwhelming.  While I do not feel novels need to be wrapped up in a nice tidy package, \\"Plainsong\\" provides minimal closure.  With the exception of the old rancher brothers, I did not see a whole lot of growth in the characters over the course of the novel.  In the end, they still strike me as a bunch of losers who could stand a good talking to from Dr. Phil.  But maybe that is the point.<br />That said, the book is a pretty quick read and well-written.  The only technical quibble I have, as other reviewers have noted, is Haruf's abandonment of quotation marks for dialogue.  Although this did not personally pose a huge reading hurdle, I still found myself constantly distracted by their absence.  Haruf is adept at creating a small-town feel, but overall I just did not feel a whole lot of satisfaction after finishing \\"Plainsong.\\"  Not awful, not awesome  just okay.	2003-04-10

Erik Larson's work is two books in one as the author weaves the stories of two very different types of architects:  Daniel Burnham, the mastermind behind the 1893 World's Fair/Columbian Exposition (later dubbed the White City) and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer whose crimes extend well-beyond dozens of gruesome deaths.  \\"Devil\\" is truly a study in contrasts: the triumph of the human spirit coupled with the embodiment of evil in a mere flip of a page.<br />Larson does an excellent job capturing the pioneering spirit of the country in the late 19th century.  The book is littered with dozens of \\"guest appearances\\" from such American icons as Thomas Edison, Annie Oakley, Susan B. Anthony, and Frank Lloyd Wright as well as many commonplace items/products of today that debuted on grounds of the Exposition.  Winning out over New York and Washington DC, Chicago faced the daunting task of topping the wildly successful Paris Exposition -- the hallmark of that Fair being a little creation called the Eiffel Tower.  The implications were clear -- the Windy City would either become one of the premier American cities or the laughing stock of the world.   <br />As inspiring as the Fair portion of the book is, the Holmes parts are equally as chilling.  The only criticisms of \\"Devil\\" may be Larson's speculations on some of Holmes' activities (he justifies these fictional moments in the footnotes) and the fairly tidy wrap-up of Holmes' story in the closing chapters of the book.  But this certainly does not detract from the work as a whole.<br />Will Burnham's Exposition be a success and Holmes' heinousness be brought to an end?  The answer may be evident but the stories of Burnham's sheer tenacity and Holmes' cold-blooded audacity keep readers rapidly turning the pages of this very readable and well-researched work.	2003-03-14

While perhaps unfair, it is almost impossible not to use David Guterson's &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; as a measuring stick for his second novel, &quot;East of the Mountains.&quot;  While both novels take place in the Pacific Northwest, there is little other similarity (and even there the geographies of Washington State are decidedly different) between the two works.<br />On the surface, the story is a simple one.  A retired surgeon (Ben Givens) faces his own mortality.  Suffering from terminal cancer, the bereaved widower decides to take a trip back to his birthplace - east of the mountains - where he plans to end his life.  En route, Ben gets into a car accident which sets off a chain reaction of odd meetings and situations which delay his plan and cause him to reflect on his past.<br />Guterson, as he displayed in &quot;Cedars,&quot; is certainly an accomplished writer and overall it was a quick read.  However, it is just plain depressing.  I am still trying to figure out how one review blurb proclaims it &quot;a strikingly joyful book.&quot;  Although pre-dating it by years, I found the despair of the central character quite similar to the one in the novel-turned-movie &quot;About Schmidt.&quot;  While empathizing with his illness, I was frustrated with Ben.  Although it surely could be argued, I just do not feel Ben changes (has an epiphany) over the course of his strange three-day journey.  So that ultimately made me question the point of &quot;Mountains.&quot;  While the one of the novel's theme of the value of each human life is certainly a worthy one - what would have been a great short story is dragged out to just a good novel.	2003-03-05

Not unlike other Anne Rice aficionados, I have plowed through her last few novels more out of habit. Rice just seemed to be simply churning out repetitive and, at times, uninspiring tales of her sizable vampire family.  So going into \\"Merrick,\\" the first fusion of the Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witch series, my expectation level was not particularly high.    <br />Things did not look good early with Louis still over-obsessing over the loss of his vampire-child Claudia hundreds of years later (and nearly three decades worth of Rice novels to boot!) while body-switched vampire David similarly overwrought with his feelings of longing/love for the title character Merrick - a current Talmasca member and \\"wrong side of the track\\" Mayfair witch. Same vampires, different day/decade/century.<br />But alas there is good news. Despite using some of her familiar writing conventions (historical flashbacks, cliff-hanger ending) \\"Merrick\\" is arguably the tightest work of Rice's career - relatively short, well-paced, pretty darn entertaining with a discernable degree of energy.  While it certainly does not reach the heights for the early Vampire Chronicles or \\"The Witching Hour,\\" I felt it was the first positive, and more importantly forward, movement in the series in a long time. The last 50 pages or so (which I will keep free from spoilers) appear to finally resolve some lingering character issues, while also heightening expectations for future installments. With the recent death of her husband and some health crises of her own, here is hoping that Rice is able to maintain the momentum gained from this union of her Vampires and Witches series.	2003-02-27

It is an ambitious first outing for novelist Glen David Gold who just happens to be the husband of author Alice Sebold.  While Gold received much critical praise for \\"Carter,\\" these days Sebold must own household bragging rights as her own debut novel, \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" has dominated the best-seller lists for nearly a year.  Other novelists must be wondering what exactly is in the water at the Gold/Sebold household!   <br />There is little to quibble about Gold's writing style.  This is not a quick read but one that takes its time in creating a canvas of 1920s America and the people who inhabit it.  That said, the nearly five-hundred novel does have it slow moments as readers wait for the payoff regarding the novel's central secrets - the mysterious death of President Warren G. Harding shortly after attending one of Carter's magic shows.  However, if one is merely focused on the resolution of that plotline alone one may be disappointed in the commitment needed to reach this point.  Gold's work is ultimately all about savoring the many unusual characters (Carter's blind female love interest, a fumbling FBI agent, the librarian smitten with the agent, a circus lion with tons of personality jump to mind) and the intriguing life of Charles Carter.<br />With this debut novel, Gold has been burdened with comparisons to E.L. Doctorow, Caleb Carr, and Michael Chabon.  While Chabon's \\"Kavelier\\" is on my to-read list, it is easy to see why the other two authors are mentioned as both Doctorow and Carr have created works in a similar vein (early 20th century America, mixing fact and fiction through the use of real-life historical figures).  In my opinion, Gold falls short in this league as Doctorow is arguably one of the best American writers out there, while Carr with \\"The Alienist\\" produced a more compelling page-turner.  But comparisons aside, there is certainly nothing terribly wrong with \\"Carter Beats the Devil\\" if it is simply allowed to stand on its own.  It is a recommended read for those looking for a richly detailed, well-written work.  Gold is definitely on my reading list radar for the future.	2003-02-18

In her second major collections of essays, the self-proclaimed nerd focuses on her strength  a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of American history and politics.  Never has literary criticism (the genre this book is lumped into) been less stodgy as Vowell tries to come to terms with the end of the Clinton era, the 2000 presidential election fiasco, and the aftermath of 9/11.  Also discussed are such wide-ranging topics as the Salem witch trials to arcade (pop-a-shot) basketball to a couple of famous Toms (movie star Cruise and former Dallas Cowboys coach Landry). I happily admit to laughing out loud several times (and learning a thing or two) while reading this intelligent and entertaining volume.<br />For those unfamiliar with Vowell, I urge you to try and get a listen to her either in her regular gig on NPR or a book tour appearance/reading that is currently being aired on C-SPAN.  Having Vowell's distinctive speaking voice in your head (she notes that she and Abraham Lincoln may share a similar oratory style -- \\"as squeaky as a six-year-old girl\\"), will only add to your reading enjoyment. <br />A slight warning  Vowell is a bleeding heart Democrat and she wears that heart proudly on her sleeve, so those with who do not have a similar political bent may have a tougher time stomaching some of the essays.  Despite having a perpetual \\"partly cloudy\\" outlook of the world, there is also a palpable optimism that runs through Vowell's work.  As she hilariously notes in one essay, her motto in any situation is \\"it could be worse.\\" And, at times, that is not a bad way at all to get through some tough times.	2003-01-06

In his past novels, Nick Hornby has provided insight into the mind of the modern adult single male.  So it was a bit of a surprise to begin &quot;How To Be Good&quot; and be confronted with a female protagonist. Interestingly enough, despite her gender, Katie Carr is not terribly different from the male leads in earlier Hornby novels - a person struggling with a healthy dose of self-doubt about relationships and pretty much just life in general.  <br />Where Hornby does venture into a new territory is in creating something other than just a humor-filled slice-of-life narrative about dating.  While both the search for love and Hornby's characteristic wit are intact, there is that title question that reverberates throughout this novel - how to be good?  Not unlike Katie, many of us go through our lives in a fairly uneventful manner thinking we are &quot;good&quot; (keeping relationships alive, going to work, having a roof over your head, etc).  But in this very materialistic society, does one have to do more -- taking in homeless people, giving food and money to those in need, or donating that extra computer to charitable group.  These are just some of the scenarios Katie faces after her husband David has a mid-life crisis (epiphany?) following a meeting new age guru-type.  Also confronted with her own guilt over an extramarital affair, Katie wonders if doing something &quot;bad&quot; cancels out all one's &quot;good&quot;?   <br />There are certainly some intriguing questions to ponder while reading this comic novel which could easily be dismissed as a superficial (if not at times wacky) look at a marriage in crisis.  However, be forewarned that there are no answers within the pages of this book - and what would be the point if there were?  While Hornby stretches reality at times, this is still the rare humorous read that makes one reflect somewhat seriously on one's own life. The key may be figuring out first &quot;what is good&quot; before starting on the journey of &quot;how&quot; to get there.	2002-12-30

I read an earlier Rapp novel (\\"Transfer of Power\\") but did not do my research and realized shortly after I had started that \\"The Third Option\\" fell between these two \\"Power\\" books.  So while I was at a bit of a loss at times, \\"Separation\\" gives you enough information to fill in some of gaps since Rapp re-claimed the White House from a gang of terrorists at the end of \\"Transfer.\\"<br />In \\"Separation,\\" Vince Flynn creates another work that is strikingly close to today's \\"real world\\" events.  Rapp's latest mission, among other things, to uncover and destroy Saddam Hussein's (with help from the North Koreans no less!) secret cache of nuclear weapons.  Throw in the setting of Washington DC where backstabbing, blackmail, and murder all seem part of a normal day and you have a highly readable, entertaining, and, at times, very relevant piece of fiction.<br />My one quibble is Rapp's love life as his relationship with Anna Reilly continues to be a weak point for me in this series.  With Rapp being more James Bond than a Clancy Jack Ryan-type, it is hard to fathom him all googly-eyed in love and considering marriage. While the pair's \\"damsel in distress\\" meeting in \\"Transfer\\" held some appeal, there is simply not much to even like about Anna this time around, much of it caused by her own stubbornness and inability to understand/accept Rapp's \\"job.\\"  Reilly was an unnecessary third wheel in this novel, with two other female characters -- CIA director-elect Irene Kennedy and fellow spy (and Rapp's ex-lover to boot) Donatella Rahn - being far more engaging.<br />I will definitely be reading more Flynn is the future - hopefully he will just shelf the romance and stick with the action.	2002-12-17

But if you are a regular reader of the legal mystery/thriller genre you know those kinds of resolutions fall to the wayside quickly.  Nevertheless, \\"Invasion of Privacy\\" starts off innocently enough as Nina returns to the courtroom -- defending a client's First Amendment right to release a documentary film about a young women who disappeared from the Tahoe shores many years ago.  With the case looking to be in the bag, Nina's eccentric client suddenly turns downright nasty.  What follows is a roller-coaster ride that uncovers many long-kept Tahoe family secrets and even some involving Nina herself.<br />As in their debut Nina Reilly novel \\"Motion To Suppress,\\" the O'Shaughnessy sisters excel in unfurling a highly-readable, if nearly unpredictable (and at times equally unrealistic) courtroom-based mystery.  However, while we learn more about the Nina's past in this novel, I still have some issues with her development as a character in this series.  I believe her as a hard-nosed and competent lawyer who can not seem to stay out of danger but find the transition to caring mother and an object of desire (to no less than three men in \\"Invasion\\"!) far less convincing.  <br />\\"Invasion\\" is not a perfect novel by any stretch of the imagination, but nevertheless it is an entertaining pool-side/wrapped-up-in-a-blanket/rainy day read.	2002-12-05

And while that is supposed to be a badge of honor, often it only seems to work against a novel by setting up overly high expectations.  Second, knowing &quot;The Hours&quot; was a homage to Virginia Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; I read that classic work beforehand but found it nearly unbearable. Despite having these two early strikes, Michael Cunningham's novel hits one out of the proverbial literary ballpark.   It flawlessly weaves three narratives - Clarissa Vaughn (nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway), a 50-something editor living in present day New York City - Laura Brown, a troubled housewife reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; in 1950s Los Angeles - and a fictionalized account of Virgina Woolf herself as she prepares to write &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;<br />One review blurb on the book's cover says this is a &quot;tour de force&quot; and it is certainly a fitting description.  The allusions between the fictional character of Mrs. Dalloway and the three women (as well as amongst the three themselves) are truly wonderful.  Perhaps, the only complaint is that the book is TOO well-crafted or gimmicky.  <br />Despite not very much liking it, I must reluctantly recommend that one reads (or attempts to read!) &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; before reading this novel as it will make for a much complete and rich reading experience.  I can not imagine I would have &quot;got&quot; this novel having not worked my way through Woolf's work (which, by the way, is relatively short).  On the heels of this book's transition to the silver screen, there is no better time to read &quot;The Hours.&quot; It is certainly a daunting task as much of the book explores the fragile (and often unspoken) emotional state of the three women.  But in the hands of its stellar cast (including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore) at least the chances of success appear to be good.  By far this was one of my bestreads of the year.	2002-11-25

I read this novel as a prelude to Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours&quot; knowing it was homage to Virginia Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  Reading Woolf took me back to my high school days when reading classic literature was a requirement. I am certainly glad I did not have to take an exam on this book. Call me a contemporary book snob, but I found Woolf's stream of consciousness writing style (some sentences often take up nearly a page) unbearable at times.  Perhaps I am just a victim of a poor attention span as well.  I think I would be &quot;getting it&quot; as I began reading a passage from &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; only to scratch my head wondering what was going on and even who was narrating as I put down the book for the evening. <br />Nevertheless, I do realize and respect this novel's place in literature.  It certainly has literary merit as Woolf's use of language is quite beautiful and stunning at times.  Likewise, it must have been groundbreaking back in the 1920s in regards to its concept (a single day in the life of a London wife) and themes (the mental anguish of the title character, particularly her lingering love for a girl she shared a single kiss with in her youth).<br />Am I sorry I read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;?  No, it certainly made &quot;The Hours&quot; a much richer reading experience.  For those who plan on reading Cunningham's contemporty spin, I would cautiously recommend a stab at &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Overall, though, I have to say Woolf was just simply not my cup of tea.	2002-11-24

It is easy to see why Friedman has multiple Pulitzer Prizes for his commentary.  Hopefully I am not alone in feeling somewhat embarrassed about how much I did not know about what is/has been going on in the world.  <br />Since this book is basically a re-hash of Friedman's columns, regular readers of the NY Times will find much of &quot;Longitudes&quot; old material.  Likewise, in reading the columns over a short period of time, one notices recurring themes in Friedman's writing.  But any repetitiveness only serves to drive home some very important points.  <br />Friedman leans to the liberal side of the political fence, so staunch Bush supporters and/or those who do not have warm and fuzzy feelings about ex-president Clinton may get a bit riled up at times.  But hopefully this will not detract anyone from reading this enlightening and thought-provoking volume and should not be merely dismissed as yet another 9/11 entry on the bestseller lists.  Simply put, in this sometimes scary and still uncertain world, &quot;Longitudes&quot; should be required reading for every American.	2002-10-31

Jimmy D's bar/restaurant has just been robbed and things will only get worse for him in the opening chapters of Brian Rouff's debut novel \\"Dice Angel.\\"  That is until a homeless man, who Jimmy has taken under his wing, hands him a business card that might just change his luck.  In sheer desperation, Jimmy meets up the title character -- Amaris, a wacky middle-age woman with a wardrobe to match, who promises to end his Vegas nightmare.  Will Amaris earn her wings?  Well, perhaps the incessant bell ringing of slot machines will provide the answer.<br />\\"Dice Angel\\" is a rollicking and fun novel. It was by far my quickest read of the year (I effortlessly sped through the first 60 pages in my first sitting).  While the reader must suspend belief regarding Amaris' magical abilities on the casino floor (hey, this is fiction!), Rouff has created a memorable cast of lovably quirky characters who ring true -- from Joy, Jimmy's ex-wife, who never quite lives up to her name to an all-Asian Jimmy Buffet cover band headed by an IRS agent to Bev, Jimmy's co-worker who would give Cheers' Carla a run for her money in the wisecrack department.  <br />Having had my fill of many of the Strip's all-you-can-eat buffets, I only wish I could add a stop to Jimmy D's on my next weekend jaunt to Sin City.  \\"Dice Angel\\" is an enjoyable and recommended read!	2002-09-24

I am probably in the minority in that I have not read &quot;Fight Club&quot; or seen its translation to the big-screen.  So based on what I did know about that work, my expectations were set for a gritty, darkly humorous reading experience.  Palahniuk not only delivers on grittiness and dark humor but also throws in a generous dose of shock value too.  I believe I am not prudish or easily shocked, but I will readily admit to a raised eyebrow and a dropped jaw on several occasions while reading &quot;Choke.&quot;  However, I often felt that Palahniuk was simply competing in a game of self-one-upman-ship.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I do not think I will be recommending to a whole lot of folks in my circle who prefer more &quot;traditional fare (which may just be 95% of fiction out there when being compared to Palahniuk).<br />Palahniuk is certainly worthy of being included in the genre of &quot;gonzo&quot; fiction - experimental, pushing the edges, no limits.  Some of the scenarios Palahniuk's protagonist, Victor Mancini, finds himself in and around are pure genius.  However, they often just seem strung together in an attempt to form (maintain?) some semblance of a narrative.  If given the opportunity, I would rate the book -- 3 1/2 stars.  Palahniuk certainly deserves kudos for his originality and sheer brashness -- but I can not help but believe he has better stuff in him than &quot;Choke.&quot;	2002-09-19

Mix a half parts of Tom Clancy and vintage John Grisham and you have a pretty good idea of what you are getting with Vince Flynn's \\"Transfer of Power.\\"  With the plot swirling around the terrorist takeover of the White House, comparisons to Clancy are only inevitable.  I am a Clancy fan, but at least with Flynn you are not bogged down with dozens of narratives, overly techno-language, and a novel 2-3 times the size.  Flynn is adept at keeping the narrative moving at a break neck speed.  Originally published in the later 1990s, today \\"Transfer\\" certainly has darker undercurrents following the events of 9/11 -- what once may have been considered a work of sheer entertainment (ala the movie \\"Air Force Once\\") now will have readers pondering the terrifying prospect of it ever becoming reality.  <br />Flynn creates a wonderful cast of characters from our make-no-mistakes hero, CIA operative Mitch Rapp, to a smarmy Vice President looking to gain during the nightmarish crisis.  Many of these characters apparently have been featured in past novels, but this being my first Flynn reading experience, I did not feel lost at all.  Of course, there a few criticisms (an unconvincing romance, the good guys going totally unnoticed while using elevators in the infiltrated White House, a tad abrupt ending) but they certainly do not detract for those looking for a good political thriller.	2002-09-04

The series must be a hit with readers and their publisher as the ninth book is set to be released later this year.  In \\"Motion To Suppress,\\" we are introduced to Nina as her career as a San Francisco attorney and her marriage to a fellow lawyer hit the skids.  With her young son in tow, Nina packs up and heads to Lake Tahoe to visit her brother.  She soon sets up shop and lands her first client -- a troubled woman seeking a restraining order from her abusive husband.  When the husband is found at the bottom of Lake Tahoe and Nina's client accused of murder the fun really begins.  <br />O'Shaughnessy is (are?!) proficient at piecing together a mystery, although it does get a bit bogged down in the middle.   However, this lasts only for a short time as crackling courtroom scenes with a fair share of twists and turns keep readers quickly flipping the final pages.  Character-wise, I never quite warmed up to our protagonist Nina.  She does not seem to be the most fun person to be around but I certainly would not mind having her as my lawyer if I ever needed one!  Despite all the unsavory folks lurking about, \\"Motion To Suppress\\" certainly made me want to visit this picturesque town on the California/Nevada border.  Overall, the novel is an entertaining who-done-it.  It is not likely to win any writing awards, but certainly worth a recommendation for a summer-time read.  I am sure I will read more of O'Shaughnessy's novels in the future.	2002-07-25

Not unlike other reviewers, I scratched my head as I put down Ian McEwan's \\"Amsterdam\\" for the final time.  I had thoroughly enjoyed much of the novel but was concerned that McEwan was slowly backing his characters into a corner.  Would it be the unrealistic (or even preposterous) end that I expected?  Yes.  But then it dawned on me that something seemed familiar - McEwan's chess-like moves reminded me of a Shakespearean tragedy.  Suddenly things started to make sense; of course, the novel could NOT end in any other way.  <br />McEwan not only had the chutzpah to do this (and in doing so, challenge -- or frustrate -- readers to accept it in modern day London) but also created a work that is a deliciously satiric look at politicians, the media, and \\"creative geniuses.\\"  Additionally, McEwan peppers in many moral/ethical dilemmas to complicate the characters' lives. There is certainly a lot of substance in this slyly simple and slim novel.  <br />This was my first venture with McEwan and it certainly will not be the last.  \\"Amsterdam\\" is a novel that only gets better the more you think about it.	2002-07-11

Cultures comically clash as Josh and some of the other \\"newer\\" families in town try to blend in with the established Mexican residents.  Bradford, who lived in New Mexico during the 1950-60s, is particularly adept at capturing the language, flavors, and feel of life in a Southwestern small town.  While some of the usual teenage angst is on display here as in other works in the \\"coming of age\\" genre, Bradford also explores more serious topics including a father who has left to go off to war and a mother's declining mental stability.<br />A self-proclaimed \\"slow\\" writer, it is doubtful that we will read more works from Bradford (he did complete a second novel, \\"So Far From Heaven,\\" five years after this one).  But Bradford's legacy is likely to remain, deservedly so, with \\"Red Sky at Morning.\\"  As the American Southwest's population explodes, one can only hope this coming of age novel finally find its place among its more famous peers.	2002-07-05

While Boyle has authored many notable and successful novels, his wonderfully unique and sardonic views of humanity seem to stay better afloat in the shorter form.  As with his mammoth short story collection &quot;TC Boyle Stories,&quot; these works are not for the conservative reader.  In reading this latest collection, one needs no further evidence that Boyle is always thinking &quot;outside the box.&quot;  He gives readers a thrilling reading experience -- a true rarity in fiction these days!<br />From a boyfriend's sadistically botched attempt to help out his girlfriend in a triathlon competition to a pair of senior citizens meeting a pitch-black humorous end in their backyard -- it is unlikely you have ever read anything like this before.  Having attended a Boyle reading/book signing for this work in October 2001, the author admitted that works like &quot;Friendly Skies&quot; (about passenger &quot;air rage&quot;) and the title story (a look at two surly survivors after Ebola wipes out much of the world as we know it) take on an unintentionally eerie spin in a post-September 11th world.<br />For fans of the author, there is probably little need for any type of recommendation, but for the uninitiated &quot;After The Plague and Other Stories&quot; is certainly a worthwhile and entertaining introduction into the wild, and sometimes warped, world of TC Boyle.	2002-07-02

The premise of \\"Density\\" is a good one, but it fails in its execution.  This novel would have been heavily scrutinized (and hopefully improved upon) by a simple review process in any type of a creative writing course.   Perhaps, not unlike his mother, Rice has a phobia when it comes to editors.  Much has been made of the many twists and turns in this novel, but I found them to be inconsistent, improbable, and often seemingly thrown in merely for \\"shock value.\\"  A final and pretty unsavory disclosure unveiled in the final paragraphs was a true groaner.  Likewise, I found the characters and plot cliché-ridden - from the overly macho high school jocks to the sensitive, theater-involved gay protagonist to the big storm burrowing down on New Orleans as the backdrop to the novel's climax.  Another issue is the characters' ability to flip their sexual preferences on and off (more on) like a light switch - with one of the partners in the ultimate gay \\"romance\\" utterly unconvincing.  I am very open-minded and willing to suspend \\"reality\\" when reading a novel, but the sheer quantity of things to overcome in \\"Density\\" was just too overwhelming.<br />As with any writer who gets published, I credit and respect Rice for getting this novel to print - although, and perhaps unfortunately, he will never be free of the onus of having a mother as a best-selling novelist.  There is great potential in \\"Density,\\" I just wish more care and time was taken to create a better end product.  Rice is young enough and already seems to have an avid fan base (if the other reviews here are any indication) to have a successful career as a writer.  I will probably give his recently published second novel a try, but will wait for memory of \\"Density\\" tofade a bit from my mind.	2002-03-13

This seems the debate raging, at quick glance, with fellow Amazon reviewers.  Having read all of Hamilton's previous works, initially my concern was that she had.   This is more a continuation of the reflective feel of \\"A Short History of a Prince\\" and less of the more plot-driven \\"The Book of Ruth\\" and \\"A Map of the World.\\"  This is where perhaps the \\"boring\\" criticism comes from, as Henry is hopelessly obsessed with his mother Beth's affair with a fellow musician.  As with \\"Prince,\\" Hamilton tells the story with a male narrator.  Whether Henry comes out sounding more like a middle-aged woman than a young man is certainly debatable, but with Hamilton's writing skill I found it hard to complain.<br />Overall, \\"Disobedience\\" is a rich and thought-provoking work.  First, there is the title.  The easy leap to make is that the title refers to Beth's extramarital affair.  But each character, in their own way, is \\"disobedient.\\"  Despite his mother's transgression, Henry's invasion of her e-mails would certainly not meet the \\"honor thy mother and father\\" criteria.  Likewise, the sub-plot of Henry's sister's (Elvira) obsession with Civil War re-enactment only sets the stage for the many internal wars going on in the novel:  a \\"typical\\" American family struggling to stay together, the battle of the sexes, and Henry's own struggle in becoming an adult.   Certainly enough fodder for a book club, which Hamilton nicely skewers even after her own post-Oprah successes.<br />While Hamilton appears to be losing some of her rabid fan-base with her last two novels, in my humble opinion, \\"Disobedience\\" is only further evidence that Hamilton has only continued to make her mark as one of the top contemporary American authors.	2002-03-06

The fun begins when Thomas and his newfound girlfriend Saxony (also infatuated with France's works) arrive in the author's hometown of Galen, Missouri.  The town hold many secrets that would be cruel to unveil here - but let's just say the residents of Galen are not quite they seem, nor the town's pet mascots - some friendly bull terriers.<br />If you are looking for something totally different to read and like to keep an open mind - there is no need to look any further than Jonathan Carroll.  Although I enjoyed \\"Sleeping in Flame,\\" I had trouble passing it along to friends just because it was SO different.   Not the case with \\"Land,\\" it is a perfect introduction to Carroll's Twilight-Zone-ish world (which makes sense since it is also the author's first novel).  Carroll will probably never be a wide commercial success, but his growing cult following is certainly well deserved.	2002-02-26

In &quot;Blood and Gold,&quot; readers once again meet a modern-day vampire and then flash back to the past to discover their past.   This time around it is the ancient vampire, Marius, who gets the biographical treatment from Anne Rice.  Given his age and importance in vampire genealogy, Marius has made many appearances in past Rice novels.  As other reviewers have noted, this leads to some retread over material covered earlier in the series.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  We are given a new perspective (or is it revisionist history?) and also a refresher course for those of us who read the original stories many years ago.<br />Overall, &quot;Blood and Gold&quot; is a slight improvement over more recent installments of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles.&quot;  While Marius clearly takes the crown as &quot;king of vampire angst&quot; in this volume, he is a much more bearable character than he was in &quot;The Vampire Armand.&quot;  Rice adds more pieces of the puzzle as Marius travels across Europe through the centuries and deals with the usual dysfunctional relationships with his fellow immortals.  After the leisurely exploration of Marius' life, the ending seems a bit rushed.  We are given a &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; recap of Marius' storyline from &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; and then catapulted back to the present day for some vampire vigilante justice. <br />Ultimately this is another mixed bag for Rice fans (those who have not read Rice should definitely not start here).  With all the groundwork already established, it seems an impossible task for Rice to ever write a &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; that is equal in energy and excitement to the earlier installments.  But not unlike her protagonists' thirst for blood, Rice aficionados' desire for new/more tales are likely never to be quenched.	2002-01-31

The novel opens as Sabine, the title character, unexpectedly faces the death of the love of her life and husband-in-name-only, Parsifal the Magician.  As time goes by, Sabine (and the reader) slowly uncover Parsifal's hidden past.   Not unlike a magician herself, Patchett skillfully weaves the journey of a handful of characters as they create a new reality of the Parsifal they thought they knew.  <br />As the cover says, this novel is very much about the feelings of love and loss of both parties. The strangers pull together (reluctantly and awkwardly at first) and soon find comfort in sharing their stories and own lives.  Sabine is able to piece together a fuller picture of the man she spent much of her life with, while Parsifal's family learn about the son and brother they spent much of their life without.  Patchett makes you care about each character (even the deceased magician).  Much to her credit, the author makes you wonder how they are doing &quot;today.&quot;	2001-12-27

As in the first installment, Eve's love interest, the mysterious and very rich Roarke, initially appears to be at the link between the murders.  With their relationship growing stronger, this time Eve seems desperate to clear Roarke's name rather than implicate him.  But fortunately for Eve there are far more suspects to concentrate on this time around.  All the supporting cast are back as well, most notably Roarke's stuffy butler Summerset and Eve's wild musician friend Mavis.  <br />&quot;Glory In Death&quot; continues the series' genre-bending ways.  It is part-mystery, part-romance, and part-sci fi.   Will it satisfy die-hard fans of each of the genres?  Probably not, as one always seems to get in the way of the other.  But for the rest of us, the mix provides a quick and entertaining read.   It is surely enough to put the next installment, &quot;Immortal In Death,&quot; on the &quot;to be read&quot; list.	2001-12-25

Americans may only know Robinson from television's &quot;The Weakest Link.&quot;  But Robinson is no overnight success.  Here we discover the decades she spent working her way up the ranks of  Fleet Street and the BBC.  Robinson also offers some many insights on two other famous Britain women of the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the late Princess Diana.<br />The memoir does a lot to dispel Robinson's image as just a nasty, insult-slinging witch.  One certainly has sympathy for Robinson's struggles and respect for her ability to ultimately prevail time and time again.  Nevertheless, Robinson is one tough lady and, like her game show persona, someone you would want to be on your side. All and all, &quot;Memoirs&quot; offers insights into the undeniable legacy of parents and the incredibly difficult balancing act between family and work - themes that should appeal even to those who are not fans of &quot;The Weakest Link.&quot;	2001-11-28

As a part-time tennis journalist/photographer myself, over the past several years I have been able to get a firsthand glimpse of the tennis world. From the cocky Williams sisters to the tempestuous Anna Kournikova to those wacky tennis parents, I can attest that Wertheim has accurately captured (warts and all) the many personalities that make up the WTA Tour. <br />Wertheim gives background information on many of the players to fill in those who do not religiously follow tennis, but he does so without boring those of us who do. There are juicy pieces of gossip that have certainly not made it into traditional sports reporting. One has to give Wertheim credit for penetrating this inner circle and somehow managing to add new material to these already very public personas. <br />The subtitle of this book is &quot;A Sensational Season Inside the Women's Tennis Tour.&quot; It could have easily (and perhaps more appropriately) been called a &quot;sensationalistic&quot; season. While Lindsay Davenport has often expressed disdain for the &quot;three-ring circus&quot; that women's tennis has become, she, along with many others, certainly understand there is no such thing as bad publicity. A must-read for any tennis fan or even those who are just curious about these women--the &quot;circus&quot; is certainly in town in &quot;Venus Envy.&quot;	2001-11-16

Sound familiar?   Published over five years ago, Tom Clancy's &quot;Executive Orders&quot; has eerily become in many ways an unfortunate reality.   Simply put, one may never be able to consider a Clancy novel a pure form of escapism again.<br />But despite the unsettling nature of the novel in light of recent events, &quot;Executive Orders&quot; is an engaging and informative read.  Readers may feel like they are getting an inside glimpse of the White House as Clancy super-protagonist, Jack Ryan, reluctantly ascends to the Presidency of the United States.  Clancy's knowledge on a wide variety of topics and his ability to keep dozens of narratives afloat in this 1,300+ page novel is truly amazing.  The sheer thickness and complexity of &quot;Executive Orders&quot; definitely calls for some perseverance - but for the most part it is worth effort.	2001-11-13

Deceptively simple in appearance, one is quite amazed as the Manhattan skyline truly unfurls in two continuous pen-and-ink drawings stretching 22 feet each!  If you do not have the room to fully open it up, you can flip 24 accordion-style pages.  Work your way up and down Manhattan's East and West sides, from small collections of apartment buildings to dense clusters of skyscrapers.  It took Matteo Pericoli, an Italian-born architect and illustrator, two-and-a-half years to create this incredible work of art.   Also included in a quite nice heavy cardboard slipcase is an essay by Paul Goldberger (an architecture critic for The New Yorker) and a handy guide pointing out famous (and not so famous) landmarks for those who may not be intimately familiar with one of the world's great skylines.<br />Although published in October 2001, the book of course features Pericoli's rendition of the World Trade Center.  While it is bittersweet and startling to see the towers even today, &quot;Manhattan Unfurled&quot; ultimately becomes (albeit unintentionally) a wonderful and loving tribute to the skyline that many of us will never forget.  Amid all the discussion of the removal of the WTC towers from movies and television, some have said in doing so is like removing a grandparent from a family photo.  Just because they are gone, does not mean we should forget or tuck them away.  Pericoli's work will certainly be a treasure to look back on for many years to come.<br />A great gift for your favorite New Yorker, art lover, artist or architect in your life -- even if that happens to be you!	2001-10-25

Contemporary literature and the movies have certainly given audiences plenty of tales of women during this time of alleged life &quot;crisis.&quot;  Thankfully, we have Nick Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; to give us some rare insight into a man's mind.  While reading this novel, one can not help think that *any* guy reading this book could not help but have a smile of recognition come across his face.  Through the eyes of record store owner Rob Fleming, readers get a comic look at how one man deals with life, love, and relationships when his long-time live-in girlfriend, Laura, leaves him for another man. <br />Some readers will be frustrated that Rob seems to be not nearly as passionate towards his girlfriend as he is with music and his record shop.  But again, this is arguably an undeniable male trait (and I am sure infuriating, in the eyes of many women) when it comes to relationships.  Rob's music and record shop could easily be substituted for sports or cars for another guy.   I am not sure if Rob makes the &quot;right&quot; relationship issue in the end, but as with all good literature, it is a good sign when an author engages us in such an internal debate.  A warning to those who may have seen or are familiar with the movie version starring John Cusack, Hollywood moved the novel's locale from London to Chicago.  The book definitely has British wit and slang.  Nevertheless, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is an enjoyable read that both sexes should enjoy.	2001-09-24

If you are looking for a reading experience like none that you have had before Jonathan Carroll's &quot;Sleeping In Flame&quot; might just be the book for you.  Other reviewers have likened Carroll's work to a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode or a David Lynch film.  This being my first Carroll novel, I found these to be accurate comparisons for the Carroll uninitiated.   The novel starts innocently enough as we meet Walker Easterling, a recently divorced part-time actor from America living in Vienna.  But soon readers are plunged into a bizarre, dreamlike world where it is simply impossible to predict where the author will take you next.  In this respect, Jonathan Carroll may have something in common with namesake Lewis Carroll of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; fame.   Not unlike Alice, Walker in the second half of this is novel finds himself in quite a rabbit hole of his own.   <br />To give away any of the details of &quot;Sleeping In Flame&quot; would spoil the fun of this novel.  Whether one wishes to take Walker's wild and weird journey literally or figuratively, an open mind is a must.  Many of the covers of Carroll's novels contain a blurb from Pat Conroy proclaiming the author &quot;a cult waiting to be born.&quot;  As with many &quot;cult classic&quot; candidates, &quot;Sleeping In Flame&quot; (and from what I gather Carroll, in general) may be too far a stretch for more conservative readers.  However, for those willing to take a wacky ride, Jonathan Carroll is certainly a driver that will have you reaching for your seat belt.	2001-09-04

As always, it is always best to start with Book 1. &quot;Naked in Death&quot; marks the debut of the NYPD detective Eve Dallas.  J.D. Robb (though the book covers now proudly proclaim that best-selling author Nora Roberts is the name behind the pseudonym) takes readers into the near, but quite different, future.  There is a ban on handguns, prostitution is legal, and (perhaps most disturbingly) coffee is very hard to come by.  But no need to worry in 2058, there is still plenty of mayhem and murder.  The &quot;In Death&quot; series is billed as &quot;romantic/suspense&quot; and soon our hard-nosed heroine finds herself tracking down a serial killer and, less successfully so, fending off a lady killer - and one of the primary suspects - the charmingly confident billionaire, Roarke. <br />For those readers (myself included) who might be put off that this is written by a romance author, there is no real need to worry.  While there is some steaminess in the bedroom, it takes a secondary role to the mystery/suspense part.  However, one minor issue I had (and perhaps this is a holdover from the romance genre) was Eve Dallas's duality - she is a tough, competent, hard boiled cop but all too often seems to be saved (and easily seduced) by Roarke.  It would have been nice if this otherwise independent woman was not so prone to having the &quot;white knight&quot; ride to the rescue time and time again.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;Naked in Death&quot; satisfied my need for a quick and entertaining read.  I plan on continuing onto the next novel, &quot;Glory In Death.&quot;  Just a warning for those new to &quot;In Death&quot; series, avoid reading the critical blurbs at the front of this book as they contain some plot &quot;spoilers&quot; for novels later in the series.	2001-08-16

Does &quot;White Teeth&quot; live up to hype?  Yes and no.  <br />It is certainly a creative, fresh, and often comic piece of fiction.   Smith has brought together a wildly divergent cast of characters living in modern day London - from the twin sons of an arranged marriage between two Bangladeshi Muslims to an 80+ year old Jamaican Jehovah Witness who rides a sidecar of a motorcycle.  The novel has an epic feel, covering a 25-year period (with some flashbacks deeper into the past) in the intertwining lives of the many characters. Smith also shifts the narrative and time period focus four times in the novel.   So, as other reviewers have noted, some characters and plot lines disappear, new ones come to the forefront, and others return.   And this is where some readers might get into trouble.  I readily admit I was baffled by the reappearance of a character in the novel's later stages (it did eventually dawn on me who it was!).  At times Smith seems to lose her focus or perhaps just fails to keep the readers' attention (I plead guilty).  With this ambitious work, some aspects of &quot;White Teeth&quot; (storylines, characters)  will appeal to some readers, while others will not. But, in my opinion, much more things work than do not.<br />All in all, this is a fine novel and an impressive debut from Zadie Smith.  Unfortunately due to the heavy buzz that &quot;White Teeth&quot; has received, some readers will be undoubtedly be left disappointed.	2001-08-09

Hamilton achieved both critical and commercial success with her first two novels &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; and  &quot;A Map of the World.&quot; Much to her credit, she does not rest on her laurels and re-hash the characters or plot in her third outing, &quot;The Short History of a Prince.&quot; In &quot;Ruth,&quot; Hamilton's narrative reads almost as a thriller reaching a shocking conclusion while in &quot;Map&quot; a tragic event early on sends readers on a downward spiral through the rest of the novel.  While there is plenty of angst in &quot;Prince,&quot; it is a much more quiet and reflective novel. The protagonist tells his story during a life-altering year as a teenager as well as a grown man in the present day.  That too is a change from Hamilton's previous work.  Perhaps tagged as a &quot;woman's&quot; writer to date, Hamilton for the first time has a male lead character in Walter McCloud.  <br />There is a lot to savor in &quot;Prince.&quot;  It is a coming-of-age story as Walter must cope with a death in the family while coming to grips with his own homosexuality.   While Walter may be one of the most well-realized gay characters put into print, one small quibble is that he seems to fall into so many  stereotypes (ballet dancer, opera/theater lover, works in a dollhouse shop, literature teacher).  Also, &quot;Prince&quot; asks the age-old question &quot;Can one ever go home again?&quot; as Walter returns to his Midwest roots as an adult.  The novel is not only about the struggle to let go of the past, but perhaps even more painfully so letting go of the dreams of the future.   <br />If you are looking for well-developed characters and beautiful prose, there is no need to go any further than a Jane Hamilton novel.	2001-07-11

What starts as a smart and funny satire of American and Japanese cultures ultimately morphs into an examination into some serious and tragic subject matter (and not just limited to the meat industry). The novel uses multiple narrative perspectives (primarily Jane Takagi-Little, an American documentary filmmaker of Japanese descent, and Akiko Ueno, a repressed Japanese housewife) and intersperses a traditional narrative style with faxes and letters to move the plot along. While the shifting tone and many points of view may frustrate some readers, one thinks Ozeki is purposely placing the reader on a roller-coaster ride. One can never really anticipate what will be around the next corner.<br />The paperback version also includes an interview with the author and discussion questions. One can see why this book has become a favorite of reading groups. The novel is filled with plenty of topics worthy of debate -- from the meaning of the American dream or &quot;ideal&quot; to each of the characters' issues with abuse and denial in their lives. Nevertheless, &quot;Meats&quot; is entertaining while never being heavy-handed (though an unflinching look at a slaughterhouse is perhaps the biggest blow to the meat industry since Oprah's beef trial and Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;).<br />In the spirit of Jane's wickedly sarcastic faxes to her meat-obsessed Japanese boss, I would have to say that this is a &quot;well done&quot; novel and definitely a &quot;rare&quot; treat.	2001-06-14

Brad Herzog has written an entertaining volume that is a combination of travelogue, history lesson, and even a bit of spiritual introspection.  Each chapter is devoted to a small town in America named after a &quot;state of mind.&quot;  Sometimes the name is well-earned (such as Triumph, a Louisiana town destroyed by hurricanes) other times the name can be quite ironic (Justice, home to the legendary Hatfield and McCoy clans in West Virginia).<br />   Herzog gives readers a fascinating history of each town, before setting off to meet some of the townspeople.  A member of the often maligned &quot;Generation X,&quot; the author also philosophically delves  into the &quot;state of mind&quot; of each place - examining Faith in South Dakota, looking for  Love in Virginia, and uncovering Honor in Michigan.  There are many lessons to be learned  by the &quot;characters&quot; Herzog and his wife, Amy, meet along the way.  For those of us living in metropolitan areas, the book is as well an eye-opening look into life in a small town (many of which seem to be in deep decline).<br />As many, I became aware of this book when Herzog was on the game show &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionnaire.&quot;  It is nice to know that this book received plenty of free (and well-earned) publicity thanks to that appearance.	2001-06-05

It always was a lot of grunt work with little results no matter what the routine or piece of equipment.  Undeterred, in the past two months, I picked up a Abs Yoga video (see my review of that if interested) and shortly thereafter this book.<br />Simply put with &quot;3-Minute Abs,&quot; you work the lower abs on day one (with two exercises), obliques on day two (up to three exercises), and upper abs on day three (up to five different exercises).  Take the next day off and start again.  Each day you attempt to get through three &quot;rounds&quot; which consist of two different exercises of 15-20 reps apiece.  Each round is timed out for a minute, but that is something you have to work up to over time.  These exercises ARE intense.  In the beginning, I was lucky to get through 1.5 rounds in the allotted 3 minutes (which the author suggests you stick to).  These days, I keep the total workout to under 5 minutes a day - figuring maintaining good form is better than trying to &quot;beat the clock.&quot;<br />I am seeing results after only a few weeks.  I have a slim build and never had much muscle tone, but I am seeing the signs of the elusive six-pack for the first time in my 30-something years.   Perhaps the &quot;secret&quot;  is concentrating on only one area of the abs each day... and hitting each area with a variety of positions/angles.  This program has made me realize just doing traditional crunches (and ignoring the obliques and lower abs) would never give me &quot;the look&quot; that most people strive for.  So be patient, stay motivated (some of the exercises are difficult -- particularly the day one, first exercise &quot;hip raises&quot;), and just do what you can.  I am confident you will see results.  And with the minimal time commitment it is difficult not to find the time.	2001-05-25

The author delves back eight generations as his ancestors cross the Atlantic and make their claim in America near Charleston.  As the title suggests, Ball explores the lives of the slaves on the family's many plantations.  This is where the book is at its most interesting.  Ball not only gives us historical accounts but also meets with descendants in the present day.  Their reactions, sometimes positive other times wary (especially where there is  evidence of an owner-slave offspring), is very good reading.<br />Unfortunately, in my opinion, there is not enough of that type of material in the later stages of the book.  At one stretch, the emphasis seems to exclusively shift to the extensive lineage of the Ball family.  Despite the genealogy chart included in the book, I found it nearly impossible to keep track of everyone.  Likewise, the author's impartiality towards his family seemed to  shift and in many instances Ball seemed to be on a mission to prove that the family's slaves were well treated.   The book also ends on an odd note as the author travels to Africa to visit one of the sites where slaves were forced to leave their native land.  There he tracks down the African descendants of those who sold slaves and asks them to atone for their ancestors' past sins as well.  While the logic of the slave seller being as guilty as the slave buyer has a good deal of validity, it just comes off as the author trying to alleviate his own burdens.   I did see Ball on a talk show several years ago and he did not come off this way, so perhaps the written word is simply more open for interpretation.<br />Nevertheless, I would recommend &quot;Slaves&quot; to anyone interested in geneology, early American (especially Southern) history, and/or the slave experience. Addtionally, with my interpretation  as compared to others, the book is open for some good discussion/debate.  There is something to be learned through out the book - but ultimately I think think that the parts are greater than the whole.	2001-05-23

The volume begins with perhaps Wiesel's best known work &quot;Night,&quot; a deeply personal and autobiographical account of a young boy's extended stays in three different concentration camps.  In under 120 pages, Wiesel tells the harrowing tale of being swept up by Nazis to the eventual liberation of the camps.<br />In &quot;Night,&quot; Wiesel writes &quot;A dark flame had entered my soul and devoured it.&quot; This stunning sentiment could easily summarize the tone and themes of the final two works, &quot;Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Accident.&quot; Both are examinations of the psychological impact of being a survivor of the Holocaust - which one can debate is even a worse fate than being killed in the camps.  Both protoganists struggle with death in relation to their pasts.  In &quot;Dawn&quot; a young man, now a part of a Jewish terrorist gang in Israel, in an ironic twist must execute a British hostage, while &quot;The Accident&quot; explores the protagonist's will to live and love after the incident simply stated in the title.<br />Originally published in French, the translations are stylistically very easy and quick reading.  Needless to say, the themes and struggles of the each man's story are neither.  Haunting and thought-provoking, &quot;The Night Trilogy&quot; give readers a more complete picture and understanding of the Holocaust experience.	2001-04-20

Having only the cursory knowledge of Iwo Jima from the immortalized &quot;photograph&quot; and monument near Arlington National Cemetary, reading &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; was an eye-opening experience.  Born in the late 60's, I grew up in with war and  its after-effects having little impact on my own personal life (somehow my immediate family escaped any time in the military).  In this deeply personal account of the events surrounding Iwo Jima, James Bradley gives the reader a detailed account of the famous battle that no high school history class lesson could do justice to.  From the &quot;underground city&quot; of Iwo to the facts surrounding the quite accidental photographic capture of the incidental second flagraising, the book is both educational and fairly quick read.<br />I was a little put-off early in the early stages of the book.  In leading up to the actual battle, Bradley seemed to have already elevated the six flagraisers to godlike status.  But having finished &quot;Flags,&quot; one can easily forgive the author for the high reverence he holds for these individuals now knowing how each of their stories ended.  Having recently visited Washington, I stopped at the US Marine Corps Memorial near the end of my trip. I did not know the names or stories of the men behind the impressive statues.  Reading &quot;Flags&quot; made me initially regret what, at the time, had been a fairly unemotional visit to yet another DC monument.  While that changed as I read &quot;Flags&quot; (I pulled out the photos I had taken several times while reading), I ultimately believe that the surviving flag raisers (particularly the author's father, John Bradley) would be quite happy that I did not associate them with the celluloid or bronze images that dogged them for the remainder of their lives. <br />It is heartening to see the success of this book.  While not a scholarly historical work, Bradley has done a great service in recording these men's stories and the brave efforts of all who have ever fought for their country.	2001-04-04

With the author's main vampire, Lestat, left in a coma-like state at then end of the last novel, &quot;Memnoch The Devil,&quot; this installment was left to explore the history of Armand.  I thought perhaps Rice was shooting for too much symbolism for the first half of &quot;Armand.&quot;  Not unlike Lestat, I found myself lulling into unconsciousness as we  followed Rice's typical path of starting in the present and flashing back to the past for the increasingly familiar story of a creation of a vampire. I was not bothered by Rice's homosexual, and even this go-round pedophilic, overtones (don't we expect Rice to push the limits?), but what was unusual was that for the first real time I was really bored reading a Rice novel (though &quot;Memnoch&quot; had it dull moments).  Usually Rice's storytelling is engaging and rich, but this was a meandering mess at times. <br />Fortunately, the story (and pacing) improves once &quot;Amadeo&quot; becomes Armand and the the narrative ditches Armand's creator, Marius.  The more modern day tale of Armand keeps the pages turning and ultimately we are given a cliffhanger ending  that will have most Chronicles enthusiasts eager to read the next novel.  So while any review will hardly discourage Rice fans from reading &quot;Armand&quot; for me it was a mixed bag.  It continued the sluggishness of &quot;Memnoch&quot; but redeemed itself at the end.  I will definitely be back for the next tale of the Vampire Chronicles.	2001-03-13

Boyle is probably one of the greatest contemporary (and most under-read) American authors that we have.  I have read many of Boyle's novels, and though while not being a fan of the short story genre, I thought I would give this massive collection of 70 short stories a try. If anything it has made me a greater fan of this talented author. Boyle excels in the shorter format bringing us tales that are highly imaginative. A warning to the Boyle uninitiated, these stories are very eccentric with a lot of dark humor throughout. Just when you think the author could not come up with a more a possibly more bizarre premise, he tops it in a later story.<br />Boyle has a wonderful command of language and readers will be amazed by how he can created a total picture with minimal words.  For example, in a story I read recently, he wrote &quot;the house... seemed almost to sink under the weight of its mortgage.&quot;  Boyle consistently creates this kind of amazing imagery throughout these stories.  From full-body condoms to a struggling game safari in the California desert to a women who keeps squirrels as pets - it is almost guaranteed that you have never read anything as original or inventive as these Boyle stories.  Do yourself a favor and pick up &quot;T.C. Boyle Stories&quot; -- and take your time and savor (I usually read a handful of stories between novels)!	2001-03-13

I only got through &quot;Corelli's Mandolin&quot; on my third attempt.  As many reviewers have cautioned, the first 100 pages or so are intimidating with various seemingly disjointed story lines, character introductions, points of view, and language (a dictionary, at times, seemed to be a suitable companion while reading). I would like to consider myself a well-read person but was self-admittedly overwhelmed by the &quot;thickness&quot; of the novel.  Perhaps, I was just too well-trained over the years with more conventional narratives.  For example, the title character, Captain Corelli, does not make his first appearance in the novel until you are well into the novel and another character, Carlo Guercio, is giving a lot of pages in the beginning only to play a fairly limited role in the second half  (though ultimately becomes one of the spiritual centers) of the novel.<br />I was only strongly motivated to finally finish this novel with the impending movie version hitting theaters in this spring.  Now having read it, I fear what Hollywood might do to it.  It is bound to lose the novel's rich character development and many of its storylines.  While the romance between the main characters is at the heart of the novel, it is its many parts that create the &quot;whole&quot; of this epic tale of love, war, family, and sacrifice.  With the movie, I anticipate there will be a revived interest in Des Bernieres' work.  I encourge potential readers to give the novel a chance.  However, if you are looking for an &quot;easy read&quot; (which the movie will certainly suggest), perhaps this is not the book for you.  But as dozens of reviewers have already said, perseverance ultimately pays off with a quite rewarding reading experience.	2001-02-08

The novel follows Woodrow &quot;Woody&quot; White's hilariously troubled trek to be re-elected as a Vermont Senator.  Not unlike real politics, Woody  has a well-document &quot;zipper&quot; problem. His troubles begin on page one with a  &quot;performance problem&quot; in the sheets during an extramarital fling with a lobbyist from the condom industry.  The wild road that follows is both unpredictable and unrelenting.  Just when you think things could not possibly get worse, they inevitably do.  Lefcourt, a screen and television writer, certainly knows how to keep the plot interesting and moving.  Each chapter has enough material to generously fill a half-hour sitcom.<br />While this is a political novel, it is also politically incorrect one.  Dachshunds, Tourette's Syndrome, and stutterers are among the many things satirically skewered by Lefcourt. The author also uses real-life political figures to further blur the line between fact and fiction (Trent Lott is involved in a key storyline and even Bill Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore make an appearance).  Lefcourt is even so bold as to &quot;borrow&quot; a Herman Melville opening line -- &quot;Call me, Ishmael.&quot;  But unlike &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (wink, wink), the protagonist of this novel is talking into a cell phone to his chief of staff.  &quot;The Woody&quot; will leave you asking &quot;Can truth really be stranger than fiction?&quot;  But given what we DO know goes on in Washington DC  -- cynically the answer is probably &quot;yes.&quot;  Overall, a very quick and enjoyable read.	2001-01-10

I found the first half of the book very compelling and wondered where this story would take me next.  Ironically, in what should have been the most suspenseful part of the book -- Dubus started to lose me. For those who have read the novel, it came at the about three-quarters of the way through where the main adversaries (Kathy and Col. Behrani) are at the disputed house under startling circumstances.  At that point, Dubus interrupts this particular narrative for a fairly lengthy examination of the third of the novel's twisted triad, Sheriff Lester Burdon.  I finished the book (the last 100 pages or so) during one lazy afternoon, but it did not quite have the same grip on me that was there in the beginning.<br />That said, it is still a generally well-written book (though I am a little surprised it was a National Book Award finalist) and an interesting examination of cultural differences and the ramifications of making bad choices in life.  The characters are unlike any that I have met before and the plot was equally as original (though I cringe at the thought of what the Hollywood studios would do to it -- probably go for some kind of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; ending).  It is a true downward spiral of a story and its ultimate conclusion has all the ingredients of a Shakespearean tragedy.	2000-12-24

But when I began reading it I turned over the cover and did seethat is was a memoir.  But much to my amazement, Verghese's book readslike a good novel .. and a well-paced, gripping page turner.  Despitebeing a doctor, this is not a dry or unemotional work either.  Readerswill be drawn into Verghese's life and find themselves experiencingthe same feelings (hope, denial, despair) when it comes to hisrelationship with former tennis pro and now med student&quot;David.&quot;<br />A true testimonial for &quot;The TennisPartner&quot; is that I have passed it along to several other peopleand they have had the same strong (and positive) reaction to it.  Theyhave since even recommended the book to others.  While this memoirdoes have a good deal of content related to tennis (this is whatinitially brings Verghese and David together) that will enhance thereading experience for fans of the sport, my non-tennis orientedfriends were not turned off by it.  Being a fairly avid reader, thishas been one of the best books I have read in the past severalyears. An unforgettable read.	2000-12-23

Detective novels have never been my favorite genre, but the concept of an unemployed lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter seemed to hard to resist.   As a transplanted New Jerseyan, it was also a treat to revisit some of the true characters that populate my former home state (stereotypes perhaps, but they get to be them for the reason).  And Evanovich has created quite a cast of characters -- from our spunky heroine Stephanie to Joe Morelli (an troubled cop in a playful love-hate relationship w/ Stephanie) to Ranger (a mysterious fellow bounty hounter who often rides to Stephanie's rescue) and Stephanie's unintentionally hilarious family headed by scrappy Grandma Mazur.  Needless to say Evanovich had me hooked and I quickly purchased &quot;Two For The Dough.&quot;	2000-12-14

This is by no means a &quot;chick&quot; book.  Having whipped through the first two books of the series, I have thoroughly enjoyed the breezy plots, laugh-out-loud humor and memorable characters (who are quickly become old friends). &quot;Two&quot; finds Stephanie still stumbling and bumbling through her new career as bounty-hunter extraordinaire.  One of the first book's most endearing characters, Grandma Mazur, has an increased role in &quot;Two&quot; as a pistol-packing granny whose primary social activity is  attending funerals in the &quot;burg.&quot;  &quot;Two&quot; won't win any literary awards, but that's not the point (truly &quot;entertaining&quot; movies rarely win Oscars either).  I plan on keeping a little behind Evanovich's writing schedule so I am not without the next Stephanie Plum book.	2000-12-14
US	52922121	RNS8OWZY5WGS4	068484477X	709347155	Stones from the River	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Long Journey Worth Taking	I purchased this book shortly after it was given Oprah's &quot;blessing&quot; and finally picked it up again (over a year's time I am sure) after a visit to Washington DC and the Holocaust Museum.  The tale of a German &quot;zwerg&quot; (dwarf) during the Nazi Era was something that I finally found myself in the right reading mood for.  This is a truly remarkable and epic novel from Ursela Hegi as we follow Trudi Montag from birth to womanhood -- and all of the rights of passage in life during this horrific time in history.  This is a thick book in many ways --  its details, themes and subject matter.  Like Trudi, readers will be haunted by the people who enter and disappear from her life.  While this is a fictional work, Hegi gives readers a history lesson about the Holocaust and Nazi Germany. &quot;Stones&quot; is particularly effective in putting a face to this time with a large cast of character from a variety of political and religious beliefs. This is not a quick read but ultimately time well spent.	2000-12-14

Using an unbiased, journalistic approach, Earley starts with a brief history of the genesis of Sin City  before delving into an in-depth look at the Circus-Circus corporation (which gave the author fairly broad access to the company's inner workings/politics -- at times probably regrettably so). There is a lot of interesting information about how any casino works -- from the positioning of slot machines (and how they are programmed to pay out) to high-stakes card tables to how room rates can change by the minute to maximize occupancy rates.<br />Earley effectively weaves several personal narratives throughout the book.  From long-time casino employees to millionnaire-corporate executives to a Vegas showgirl to an under-age prostitute (with the proverbial &quot;heart of gold).  Anecdotal tales of casino con artists, high-rollers, and a local gentleman and  his wife suffering from Alzheimers among many others should keep most readers' attention.<br />I have visited Las Vegas several times over the years and love it.  Though not a huge fan of the Circus Circus properties, the book helped me to understand why -- and how the now renamed corporation (Mandalay Bay) is trying to change that.  A definite recommendation to any fellow Vegas fan (or, in general, casino lover) or future visitor.	2000-12-11

At this point, most know of Armstrong's triumph over tesiticular cancer and winning of biking's greatest challenge, the Tour de France -- we don't know much of Armstrong the man (or husband or father as the book cover proclaims).  All the ingredients were in place for a typical celebrity autobiography -- trouble kind turns life around by becoming world class-athlete faces life-threatening disease and comes out on top.  However, with some mild guilt, I never found myself liking Armstrong that much and in fact he was a bit of a jerk.  <br />I expected to be swayed when Armstrong's life was rocked by cancer.  To some effect it did -- but Armstrong's cocky attitude towards his own life did not sway as he stard death in the face.  But then I realized that there was something very refreshing to this about this.  Though this could have easily fallen into the drippy sentimentality of a &quot;disease of the week&quot; TV movie (and probably will some day if Hollywood has its way), it did not.  While the above Amazon review says the story will &quot;melt the most hard-bitten soul&quot; I hold true to that mine was merely &quot;thawed.&quot;  I hope my soul is not alone out there, but my gut tells me that Armstrong's intention was not to have anyone feeling sorry for him.<br />Overall, the book is an informative look at the world of bike racing and cancer treatment.  I do respect Armstrong's life journey and truly miraculous comeback.   I just  find his machismo something that would prevent me from sharing a friendly beer with him in the real world.	2000-12-11

Vowell often finds herself to be the  proverbial &quot;fish out of water&quot; with journeys that take her to many fascinating  and diverse places such as Hoboken, NJ (home of Frank Sinatra), Walt Disney World, rock 'n roll &quot;camp,&quot; and San Francisco &quot;goth&quot; clubs. You are guaranteed to be smiling or laughing out loud at some point as you read each essay.<br />But if fun is not all you are looking for, Vowell is also a walking encyclopedia.  Vowell gives us a history lesson in two essays in particular.  &quot;Michigan and Wacker&quot; is a virtual history of Chicago in 13 pages, while &quot;What I See When I Look at a $20 Bill&quot; is an intriguing take on the Trail of Tears which forced Native Americans out of Georgia to Oklahoma. Embarassingly, I learned more about this ugly chapter in American history than was taught to me in high school.<br />I recently had a chance to go to a Vowell reading (along with her NPR colleague, David Sedaris -- a wonderful pairing by the way). Vowell's speaking voice is very distinctive and made me enjoy reading this collection even more since I was able to &quot;hear&quot; her as I read.  I encourage folks to seek her out on NPR to get the more complete Vowell experience.	2000-12-08
US	52922121	R1LUU49SWXL359	006017143X	807655132	The Night Listener: A Novel	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Maupin Delivers...Eventually	The first mistake that a Maupin fan can make going into &quot;The Night Listener&quot; is to think it is going to be like the &quot;Tales&quot; series or even &quot;Maybe The Moon.&quot;  &quot;Tales&quot; is over 20 years ago and Maupin's last novel &quot;Moon&quot; is nearing a decade old.  Maupin is cleary  in a different stage in life (and who would not be after all those years) and that is reflected in the tone and style of  this book.  While &quot;Tales&quot; could be eaten up voraciously like a bag of potato chips, &quot;The Night Listener&quot; is more like sitting down for a meal.<br />But to continue you that analogy, initially I was not sure how much I was liking this meal. The characters were not very likeable (unlike &quot;Tales&quot; where the characters really were  &quot;old friends&quot; over time) and Maupin's approach to gay characters/issues was much more direct (heavy handed at times) than before. Likewise, the speedy escalation of the &quot;father-son&quot; relationship that develops between the main character (Gabriel Noone), and the young writer(Pete Lomax) was a bit offputting.<br />But Maupin tends not to disappoint and about halfway through the book he throws us one of his characteristic curve-balls that certainly kept me flipping pages much more quickly through the remainder of the book (and another doozy of a twist at the end). Also, for &quot;Tales&quot; fans there is a nice surprise connection revealed as well.<br />Unlike other Maupin works, I found myself thinking more about things a book club might discuss  (the character/pure plot-driven &quot;Tales&quot; series would never make the cut for a book club selection).  Who is &quot;The Night Listener?&quot;  Many characters take on that role.  The blur between fact-and-fiction (from what I know of his &quot;personal&quot; life Maupin is very much a twin of Gabriel) and furthermore fantasy-vs-reality. Some readers will be frustrated with the lack of resolution (we never do know the &quot;truth&quot;), but life itself never gives us all of the answers.  So after some initial concerns, &quot;The Night Listener&quot; delivered.  One hopes that Gabriel Noone's writer's block  is just a figment of  Maupin's imagination and that we don't have to wait too long for his next novel.	2000-12-07
