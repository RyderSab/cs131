My hat is off to the author, and the time it must have taken her to do the  research and then write this tome.  I read it in 1-1/2 days, and at 300+  pages that's no mean feat.<br />The author writes with compassion, yet is  objective about Princess Diana's travails.  What was chilling to read was  the head-in-the-sand attitude of the British tabloids(and their society as  a whole) when dealing with mental illness.  The &quot;stiff upper lip&quot;  is no fiction - that's their motto, and it helped cripple Princess  Diana.<br />I have never been a fan of any royal family, and before reading  this book I had a low opinion of Prince Charles, as well.  But that's  because I'd been reading some very biased information put out by Princess  Diana in interviews with the British press, tv, etc.  Prince Charles did  try to get help for her when they were experiencing problems in their  marriage, but his attempts weren't successful.<br />While reading the book, I  was somewhat relieved to know she was never in a leadership capacity (scary  to think that Bill Clinton IS!) - the royal family is and has always been  there for show.  (Why the British people haven't revolted and gotten their  money back from the monarchy and invested it more wisely has always been a  mystery to me.)<br />It was sad that she was never encouraged during her youth  or adolescence to become a person in her own right.  She just got the  spoken and unspoken message that she was to work towards marrying a man of  means and be an appendage to him.<br />I think the author's presentation of  Princess Diana's problem as mental illness was right on the mark.<br />Mental  illness is not a subject most people want to discuss (no matter what your  country of origin).  As Princess Diana's life proved, this unwillingness  can have disastrous consequences.<br />Princess Diana didn't deserve the  slavish devotion she received, but she didn't deserve to die the way she  did, either.	2000-08-27

It is a timeless  novel, with too much truth to it. <br />It also saddens me to know that there  are still people in this world who hate others simply because their skin is  a different color, or they may have differences in beliefs, atittudes, ad  naseum.  The hate crimes we keep reading about in the papers show we  haven't come a long way.<br />I only lament that I didn't first read this book  until I went to college and started reading it in a speed reading class.   HA!  There is no way you can read this book in a speedy manner.  It needs  to be savored slowly and revisited to fully appreciate the story.<br />I also  gave a speech on Ms. Harper's book in class as part of an assignment to  sell something.  Even students who didn't like reading were willing to take  a chance on it, and thanked me later.<br />I just wish Ms. Harper had written  other novels.  Not sequels, of course.  It would be impossible to write  another book about the Finches, or their world.	2000-08-27

She's also delusional in that she believes in  the beginning of the affair she will be able to control the outcome, and  it's just a fling anyway, to bolster her sagging middle-aged ego.  In that  respect, it's not a sexist book.  Women can be just as stupid as men when  middle-age looms (why she didn't just go out and buy a Porsche is beyond me  -  the only damage it would have done would be to their checkbook). <br />She  seems to feel that as long as she and her married lover keep a low profile,  things are ok.<br />She never really owns up to the destruction she's spread  in her path.  And her statement that she is brave for seeking treatment  (with other women at the psychiatric hospital she stays at - at her  doctor's urging) would be laughable, except you realize she's  serious.<br />This was not a delightful read.  It was compelling, however.   And if the author's eventual goal was to provide a cautionary tale, then  she succeeded.<br />She needs to read a few books by Robin Norwood, so she'll  stop defining her life through men.  She harps about how she needs  meaningful work (and for her that means writing and teaching), but she  seems always to be on the lookout for her next partner.<br />She doesn't seem  to have learned anything from her experiences.	2000-05-14

That when you have kids, you give up a large part of  yourself and your life (and it's usually the woman).  In this year, 2000, I  don't know if women are any better off than Norma was.

As reviewers from Massachusetts and Long Island note, this is avery dangerous book of misinformation and self-hatred. This is theonly book I've ever owned that I tore up and then threw away.  Ididn't want anyone I knew to read it. I was disgusted with Ms. Green's view of the world.  To her, only two species of people exist: thin and fat, and guess where you should strive to be? Secondly, she has some pretty crackpot ideas about the workplace (a place she's never been - she married right out of high school and commenced to become a baby factory).  She thinks only thin people should be hired to work. WHAT?   I believe she cited health reasons, they're more reliable, etc.  It is to laugh, Ms. Green.  I know more devious, self-centered, scary thin people in an office who waste their work time having affairs with their bosses - going on 2-1/2 hour lunches, etc., than people who have a little more meat on their bones.  The latter KNOW they have to produce.  They can't get by by literally kissing up to their superiors. Her absence of self-awareness is scary as well.  She is horrified and furious when her husband takes her on a surprise evening outing where they arrive at an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, but she sees nothing wrong with the idea of perhaps humiliating a friend into getting thin by sending her pictures at her heaviest.  But then, she really doesn't want anyone else to get thin but herself. Her continuing contest to compare her body with her sisters was sad, childish, and pathetic. Ms.  Green has never really moved beyond graduating from high school...	2000-05-04

Inspector Thanet has a wealth of suspects to choose from, and it's hard to winnow them down.  Was it the extremely jealous soon-to-be ex-husband?  Said husband's mother?  The deceased's  married lover?  The married lover's wife?  They all had a  reason (or two or three)to dispatch her.

Her characters are fully realized, you see them with all  their faults and foibles.  And this book is very timely, but I can't say  more than that, because I'd spoil some of the mystery. Another thing I  enjoy about D. Simpson's series, is that you really believe there is an  Inspector Thanet.  We're taken along with him when he goes home (I suggest  you find the very first book and read all of them in sequence - because you  find out about his wife and two children - their struggles in childrearing  AND Thanet's problems in dealing with a wife who wants to work outside the  home)as well as out and about interviewing suspects.

The accompanying text throughout gives you an  understanding of her drawings - and how she's able to unleash that part of  her creativity - and have FUN!  I never fail to read the latest Natalie  Goldberg book - her insights, her truthfulness about her struggles help me  realize that we're all artists.  Some of us are just a little freer and  further along than the rest.  Thank goodness Natalie keeps writing to show  us paths that she's hewn for herself.	2000-01-29

I've been a faithful reader of Ms. Eichler's books since their inception and this is one of the best.  I love Desiree's sense of humor, her acceptance of self (she's not sylph-like and doesn't mind).  She's an  everywoman, who knows what's important:  shopping, Hagen Daas(sic), oh  yeah, and catching the bad guy/girl.  At least now I know when her next  book's coming out - February.  HURRY UP, FEBRUARY!	2000-01-29

I enjoy Carolyn Hart's mysteries, but Laurel is getting very annoying and boring.  I enjoy the references to other mystery writers and the rest of her characters are usually well-written.   One other minor complaint,  please stop the cutesy pie allusions to Annie and her hubby when they're  about to &quot;get intimate.&quot;  Puhleeze, it's just too juvenile for  words.	2000-01-29

I'm going broke buying copies for friends, relatives' children, etc.  No way am I going to give up MY copy.  It's simply too essential to my sense of humor and mental health.  I'm just glad someone had the incredible idea  to compile a collection of George and Martha's adventures into one tome.   THANK YOU!   As far as I'm concerned, George and Martha are just as real  as any humans I ever met (and a lot more fun than most!).  Their trials and  travails reflect what all of us deal with in trying to stay true blue to  our pals. I miss James Marshall so much.  It's hard to believe we won't get  any new adventures in the George and Martha saga (did you know he named  them after the main characters in &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia  Woolfe? &quot;).  The mind wobbles.	2000-01-29

Reading &quot;Yummers&quot; gives you an inkling of what bibliophiles miss.  His gentle humor, comical yet endearing illustrations.  And yet, always wisdom behind the joke.  But  he never beats you over the head with it.  I've read all of James  Marshall's books (over and over) and I never get tired of them.  At least  we've got something to remember him by.	2000-01-29

It might be the only thing that will have you laughing hysterically at that ungodly hour!  (It worked miracles for me.)  I have to buy another copy because I gave it to my sister when she left for  California after my mom's funeral.  During the family get-together after  the service (and when all the visitors had left), my sister and I read  dueling chapters of the book.  Somehow I don't think my mom minded.  Dave  helped cheer us up.  I just wish he'd come up with volume II.	2000-01-24
