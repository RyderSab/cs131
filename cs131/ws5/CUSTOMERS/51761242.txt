I was amazed at the mass of evidence which pointed directly to OJ Simpson. I never realized that there was THAT much evidence which would have put away any man in a matter of days (of court). Fuhrman also points out the reasons why much of the evidence was not used - and one will be utterly amazed at the tactics of the defense and the prosecution to suppress evidence!<br /><br />There were two parts of the book that, at first, I did not think belonged in the book. The sections were about Fuhrman's later problems with his former lady friend, the potential screenwriter, and what he said ten years ealier. And how it came back to haunt him. The other section dealt with his problems with Margaret York (a police capitan who was Judge Lance Ito's wife). At first, I didn't think these were necessary to be in the book. But, at the conclusion of the book, I now understand why Fuhrman included these chapters. It sets up the whole trial against Fuhrman.<br /><br />I enjoyed Fuhrman's caustic attitude toward York, the Defense Team (especially Cochran), and the prosecution (both Marsha and Christopher). Fuhrman was vilified at the trial because he said the \\"n-word\\", and OJ kills two people and gets off scott free!	2005-10-04

Steve Thomas's book was an exceptionally, well written book about the JonBenet murder. It is the first book I have ever given five stars to. Steve Thomas, as a detective on the case, lays out the facts as he found them and comes to the conclusion that Patsy Ramsey accidentally killed her daughter. He describes the aggravation of getting a murder indictment against her and fighting with the DA's office to move forward on the indictment. Based on what I had heard and read over the years, I suspected that she was responsible or, at least, knew something.<br /><br />After reading Thomas's book, I am convinced, based on the facts presented, that she was responsible for this act. Nothing else makes sense. Thomas also destroys Lou Smit's intruder theory. I do not believe that Thomas has an axe to grind with anyone. I think he accurately and objectively presents the facts regarding this murder.<br /><br />If you like crime books, this is exceptional. It was so good that I finished the book within a week.	2005-09-28

I am interested in stories like this. The first part of the book describing the flight and its subsequent crash was quite interesting - very readable.<br /><br />However, I expected more stories about the ghosts of Repo and Loft than what I read. Yes, there were a handful of ghost encounters related by various flight crews but there did not seem to be enough of these to fill the book.<br /><br />Interspersed with the ghost encounters were topics around mediums; information on ghosts and their relationship to the Bible; Fuller's stories about earlier research he was doing; and so forth which, I felt, detracted from the interest of the book.	2005-09-14

It was superbly written and highly engrossing. The book begins by analyzing the early lives of the Kennedys beginning with Patrick Kennedy (Joseph Kennedy's grandfather). He describes their travels from Ireland to their arrival in the US. Davis acknowledges that there is not much information on the early Kennedys, but writes on the history based on what typically happened during that time frame.<br /><br />We see the natural growth of the Kennedy clan over many years. The book really begins to pick up when Joseph Kennedy comes of age and marries Rose. Then, of course, we are introduced to the rest of the family and especially to the exploits of JFK.<br /><br />The book deals heavily with the rise of JFK to his ascendancy as the President. Davis discusses at length the assassination of JFK. Davis doesn't go into too much detail about RFK, but makes up for it in discussing Teddy, Chappaquiddick, and his pursuit of the presidency.<br /><br />Now, the negatives. I don't think he goes into enough detail surrounding the exploits of Joseph P. Kennedy. The chapters discussing the life of Jackie Bouvier seemed out of place. I skipped these three chapters as they did nothing for me. There was a lot of discussion about the theories behind the assassination of JFK and who could have been responsible. It was fascinating reading (not necessarily a negative, but maybe a bit too much for the book). I felt that Davis glossed over RFK and his contributions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book was excellent. To compliment this book, I recommend \\"Sins of the Father\\" (about Joseph Kennedy) by Ronald Kessler and \\"RFK and His Times\\" by A. Schlesinger. Combined, these three books adequately cover the Kennedys.	2005-09-14

I new that Anthony Summers' books had a reputation of tearing apart its subjects. I liked Nixon and was afraid that this book was going to trash him. But, after reading the book and noting the extensive footnotes, I conclude that most of his reports must have a ring of truth to them. I had just finished reading Nixon's \\"In The Arena\\" and then started Summers' book. Summers painted a completely different picture of Nixon than Nixon painted for himself. It appears that Nixon really whitewashed himself in \\"In The Arena\\". I believe that Summers' book paints a more realistic picture of Nixon.<br /><br />The only thing about the book that I didn't really like was that he would begin one chapter and expound upon the subject, then move into Nixon's latter years and how he still felt about the particular subject. Then, Summers would start a new chapter and it would go back to when Nixon was young and move forward again. I believe the book could have been better structured to read as an historical novel without the jumping around in time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, worth reading if you enjoy Nixon history.	2005-08-17

I found Rawlings' stories of peoples trips to the afterlife truly fascinating. In saying that, I don't think Rawlings added enough information as to how the \\"event\\" changed peoples lives for the better. Secondly, with respect to those who had died and gone to Hell, Rawlings doesn't give any information as to why those people may have gone to Hell. Where they bad people to start with? Were they general jerks? Background information of this sort would have helped.<br /><br />I agree with another review that some of the book was filler:  how to do CPR; what you need to do to change your life for the better; and so on. I would have preferred less filler and more on the lives of those who died with a brief history of their backgrounds.	2005-07-05

Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed with \\"In The Arena\\". Nixon covers much about his life in politics and gives us his personal views on life, his wife, family, friends, television, books, and so on. Reading this book was much like listening to your favorite, wise, ol' grandad talking about his life and what he experienced. IF you are not interested in that, don't read this book. You'll be disappointed. Personally, I was more interested in his pointed comments about politics, foreign policies, political leaders, war, and so on but there wasn't enough of that.	2005-07-05

Finally, I took the plunge and it was as most people reviewed - quite good and thoroughly researched. The book is quite long - my copy ran 750 pages. The narrative about the Japanese planning and buildup was incredible. However, it took about 100 pages of reading before the Japanese names and faces started to sink in.<br /><br />The story of the actual attack did not last as long as I had wished because I was interested in the actual battle itself, as well. And, finally, the rather boring bit came with the investigation of Kimmel, Short, and others.<br /><br />The book should be read by any student of WWII history but I should say that one should REALLY be interested in the behind-the-scenes look into the planning. The book is not for the casual reader of Pacific WWII history. I found that the narrative on the investigation got to be a bit tedious.<br /><br />I was rather surprised that the US could not pinpoint the exact location of the coming attack. And Prange goes into great detail specifying that Roosevelt was NOT deceitful in getting us into war. Nevertheless, Prange does point out the mistakes made without pointing fingers. After reading this book, it is rather incredible that the Japs caught us with our pants down.	2005-06-03

Graysmith, naturally, does a great job weaving all of the details into a fine crime novel. I have enjoyed most of his crime books and this one was no exception.<br /><br />Others have criticised Graysmith for focusing too much on Carpenter but after reading the book and the statements being based on fact and supported by statements from the detectives, I have to say that Carpenter really does look guilty. In saying that, I think the police departments could have done a better investigation of the case and looked more into some of the suspects mentioned in the book. It is amazing that police departments were so careless.<br /><br />The book doesn't go into great detail about sexual specifics and graphic sexual descriptions (this is not one of those fiction love novels!) but he gives you enough detail which leaves you shaking your head at Crane's exploits.<br /><br />A typically good Graysmith book and definitely worth a read.	2005-06-03
US	51761242	R3SRPWDFCWVQYF	0316105848	755102072	Flyboys: A True Story of Courage	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Lots of history, but not much on Chichi Jima	After reading the book, I have to agree with the review listed by Publishers Weekly. I thought the book was about the battle of Chichi Jima based on the perspective of the nine flyboys (including George Bush). However, the battle isn't actually covered till about halfway through the book. The author begins with a history lesson of pre-war Japan and has a look at when Admiral Perry first landed in Japan. My first thoughts were \\"...why the history lesson?\\" Then, we are treated to perspectives of Billy Mitchell and his pre-war court martial. It was only later I realized that the author was setting the stage for the battle of Chichi Jima. In that case, after reflection, Bradley's pre-history lesson made sense.<br /><br />The book is supposed to tell the story of the flyers and the horrors they endured when captured. Bradley is excellent in telling us the horrors that transpired. And, he weaves the ordeals that the families went through back home in wondering what happened to their sons.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book but I found myself asking several times why was the history lesson of Japan included; why have the war crimes trials been included? All in all, I enjoyed the book and others here have certainly captured some of the flaws with Bradley's story. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book albeit with some warning that the book is not really about the Chichi Jima battle itself.	2005-03-04

Levy begins with a look at Wiesenthal's experience as a young Jew in pre-war Europe. He later chronicles Simon's life during the war in the camps and his search for his family after the war. The stories make for fascinating reading. Then, Levy writes how Simon got into the business of Nazi hunting.<br /><br />The chapters describing the hunts for Adolf Eichmann (and the rivals between Mossad and Wiesenthal), Josef Mengele, and Franz Stangl were absoluting quality reading. After the chapters on these three Nazis, and the brief chapter on the concentration camp guards, the book takes a different path and describes the ordeal of Raoul Wallenberg. Although Wallenberg was not a Nazi, but a humanist dedicating to saving the lives of Jews, I had to ask myself what this chapter was doing in the book. Nevertheless, it was quite fascinating to read about the ordeal Wallenberg faced and to read what actually happened to him during the war, and especially, after the war.<br /><br />At this point, you can quit reading the book. The next chapters dealt with Bruno Kriesky and Kurt Waldheim. I didn't have a clue who Bruno was. (I believe he became chancellor of Austria during the '70s). Why was he in this book? As far as I can tell, it was due to Simon and Bruno not liking each other. Bruno was a Jew who claimed that he was not a Jew and tried to distance himself from Jews during the war. He didn't kill any Jews, so why have his story in this book? It's wasted space.<br /><br />As far as Waldheim is concerned, the jury appears to be out as far as his guilt is concerned. There never seems to be direct evidence pointing to Waldheim as to whether he was responsible for killing partisans (or at least KNEW some killings took place)<br /><br />in Yugoslavia. Waldheim's superiors (during the war) say that he did not have the authority to kill or order killings; a sargaent who reported to Waldheim said that he did. Some say he was present at the time the killings took place; others said he was not. Some say that as part of intelligence, and as a lowly lieutenant, Waldheim would not have known about partisan killings. Others said how did he not know? If no one knows the truth, why read it about in this book? Even the Yugoslavian government has refused to prosecute. So, I may ask, why fill 150 pages of this book if there is no conclusive evidence that Waldheim is guilty? The later part of these chapters were very boring. The book was about hunting murderous NAZIS, not about people who were ashamed of being Jewish or about German Army officers.<br /><br />The book should have included the hunt for Nazi Klaus Barbie and other Nazis who eluded capture for many years. Then, I would have rated this book 4 stars. But, to include chapters on Bruno Kriesky and Kurt Waldheim? A real time waster..

You realize what a truly and personal man that he was; and how he would have made a difference had he been elected President (speculation, of course). Nevertheless, we read what a caring and compassionate man that we was - a great supporter of the poor, the needy, the Blacks, civil rights - we could definitely use more people like him today who truly believe in these causes.<br /><br />The book deals with his fights in the McCarthy era; his fights with Hoffa and other organized crime figures; the Cuban crises, and so on. The book seems compartmentalized, in this respect, and may have read better if it had been written in a chronological type order. Nevertheless, the book is exceptional. I think Arthur Schlesinger writes objectively and I disagree that the book is written in a worship style. For my purposes, once the book gets to the part where RFK joins his brother in the administration, the book really takes off.<br /><br />After reading this book, you realize what a loss the world is without a human like RFK.	2005-01-11

He doesn't speculate as to what the UFOs are - he lets the facts speak for themselves as they are presented. As a result, his material appears to be well founded and his writing style is very readable. Certainly a thought provoking book!	2005-01-11

I had heard many stories about the man, but I didn't realize to what extent these stories were myths or real. Kessler certainly dispels that these stories are myths. He tells us what a manipulative, conniving, scheming, deceitful man that Kennedy really was.<br /><br />We are treated to the stories of Kennedy's manipulation of the stock market for his own personal gain; his illegal importation of scotch to pad his growing millions; his manipulation and theft of Gloria Swanson's monies. It doesn't stop there. Kessler tells about how Joe wanted to avert war since he was afraid he would lose millions of dollars.<br /><br />Kessler tells us how much Joe manipulated and controlled his children so that they would conform to his standards; and how their political life was formed in order for Joe to pursue his own dreams via his children's lives.<br /><br />After reading of Joe's death, one has to wonder whether Joe's cruel and deceitful life was worth it in the end - two assassinated children; Rosemary's lobotomy; a family myth built on lies. A simply incredible book - first rate from start to finish.	2004-11-03

Target Berlin recounts the first daylight mission of the 8th Air Force into Berlin on March 6, 1944. The authors do a superb job of writing such that you have the impression of flying along with the pilots (both German and American) over Berlin. You ride along with the B-17 and the B-24 crews as they arise for the morning briefing. The ride continues as the crews assemble over England and head out for the flak-ridden skies over Europe.<br /><br />The story is juxtaposed with those of the \\"Little Friends\\" (the P-51 and P-47 fighter pilots), in addition to first-hand narratives by the German fighter pilots. This is a story which switches between the bombers and the fighter pilots which leads to a realistic \\"you are there\\" story.<br /><br />The reader is also treated to jumping out of the planes after being hit with flak or enemy bullets. You ride down through the skies watching the battle take place around you as you ponder what is must have been like knowing you were about to land in German territory.<br /><br />Once you get past the first chapter, the book literally takes off. The British have a tendency to go overhead talking about how many planes / bombs / guns each unit (on each side) had, so that first chapter gets a bit tedious. Get through that and you got it made!	2004-09-30

When I saw that its authors was a group called \\"The Pacific War Research Society\\" and made up by 14 Japanese researchers, my heart sank thinking that the book would be very biased in Japan's favor. I was completely wrong. The book was very even handed with respect to presenting the story from both sides (the US and the Japanese versions). The writing and the translation was impeccable.<br /><br />The book indicated that the bomb was originally created for use against Nazi Germany. The US and its scientists were concerned that Hitler would use an atom bomb against the Allies. When Germany surrendered, the scientists were no longer excited about the use of the bomb against Japan - a fact I had not known.<br /><br />The authors suggest that the Imperial Army controlled the country and it was the Army which suggested that Japan would fight to the death. The Allied insistence of \\"unconditional surrender\\" remained an \\"...insurmountable stumbling block\\" and that the Japanese leaders believed that the Army never would have accepted this and that Japan would have been plunged into civil war.<br /><br />The authors suggest that the Emperor knew the war was finished but that Japan could not find an honorable way of surrendering without losing face. The Army continued preaching that they have the spiritual upper hand. Even though the Emperor and his ministers prefered an end of war, the Army won out.<br /><br />The description of the horror of the bomb was absolutely incredible. I commend the Research Society for a very straight forward book on the path to the use of the bomb. They blame both sides for mistakes made which lead to the use of the bomb. And, they neither condemn or praise each side for what happened. A superb book.	2004-09-16

The initial portion of the book throws out lots of names and it takes several pages until the names start to sink in with respect to who's who. The portion of the book dealing with the case was a bit boring and too long. And, I was not very interested in the author's psychoanalysis of Aileen.

Fletcher covers the gamut of Moon's life: his childhood where we begin to see his restless nature; his early career in music; his indoctrination into The Who; and his plunge into rock-and-roll excess - drugs, booze, whores, drunken pranks.<br /><br /> Naturally, with any biography of someone famous, you have to read about the early years to understand the latter years. I never like reading about the early years, but you can certainly see a pattern that's being created in Moon. And, how it gets crazier each year, especially with success.<br /><br /> I would have preferred more in depth detail about the making of each album with respect to Keith's drumming; it's there, but not as much detail as I would have liked (being an amateur drummer myself). Since the book is about Moon, Fletcher doesn't go into too much histrionics about the band themselves, but writes more from Keith's perspective.<br /><br /> The book becomes a bit depressing when you realize that Keith is out of control and I find myself wondering why he couldn't get it under control? You put yourself in his place and think &quot;I've got money and everything, why must I behave this way?&quot; From this point of view, you wonder...what was the point, Keith?<br /><br /> The conclusion of the book leaves you wondering what could have been if he had gotten his act together and made a half-hearted attempt at going straight.<br /><br /> The book is definitely recommended if you are a Who fan. It's superb reading, can be a bit tedious with all the repetitive shenanigans of Keith, but well worth reading.	2004-07-22

This book describes the POW experiences of 9 Americans (2 pilots and 7 soldiers) held in Vietnamese jungle prison camps and, later, the Hanoi Hilton. The first third of the book covers time spent by the grunts as they were captured and held in the jungle. Initially, I was disappointed not to read about the Hanoi Hilton, but the author slowly leads us up to that point. He describes, after several years in prison jungles, how the soldiers are moved out north, toward Hanoi, and later kept in the Hilton with other prisoners. The stories are told in first person narratives and are interwoven with stories from the other camp mates. This book is not about prisoners in various camps around Viet Nam, but about one specific camp. Nevertheless, it is an excellent book about their experiences in the jungle prison and the torture and boredom they lived through day end and day out. I recommend this book along with Grant's &quot;Over the Beach&quot; (about jet pilots flying off of the Oriskany on bombing missions over North Viet Nam).	2004-05-28

It is as good as the books written by Jim Lovell and Andrew Chaikin. The book is an easy read and flows very smoothly. It has an unusual style in that the book alternates between the &quot;present&quot; and personal recollections from the astronauts as they were growing up. It serves to put into context how the world had changed when they became of age.<br />One learns of the boring and routineness of space travel (I didn't think about that aspect) and that some &quot;personal&quot; accidents do happen - like a release of defecant or vomit into the spacecraft; again, one never really thinks of these aspects.<br />However, since we know that the highlight of the mission was the reading from Genesis, you get the feeling that the book is anti-climatic after this point. Nevertheless, it is an excellent book and I highly recommend it with Lovell's and Chaikin's book to get a well-rounded experience of the space program.	2004-04-27

I was quite impressed by how unprepared the US troops were - I never realized that they were so thoroughly defeated (almost!).<br />The book describes in unbelievable detail in the words of the soldiers themselves the horror of war; the extreme cold; the hand to hand combat; the infiltration by the Germans into the American lines; being taken prisoner and its living conditions; and the turnaround where the US finally gained the upperhand in the battle.<br />The last chapter of the book regarding what they soldiers had learned and their reflections from today really bring the whole book together.<br />I recommend this book in conjunction with Peter Elstob's book, \\"Hitler's Last Offensive\\".	2004-03-31

Edgar Hoover; the second half deals with the FBI under each of the different heads after Hoover died. I enjoyed the part about Hoover better than the second half. It shows the rise of the FBI and talks about the iron-fisted leadership under Hoover (and what a grand schemer and blackmailer he was).<br />The second half leaves you wondering how the FBI has made it this far today - with its spies, 10 year old computer systems, misguided direction under Freeh and Sessions. These stories in the second half of the book suggests that the FBI has survived  despite itself!<br />The book is worth reading - not the great book that others describe, but not bad either. It's worth a read if you want to know about the FBI history.	2004-03-11

The best stories were from the Viet Nam era, one from Korea and a few from World War II - especially the story from Ted Lawson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo) and the story about the Enola Gay. Wow! The rest of the stories were OK but I didn't find them to be a knock-down jaw dropper as others found them. Nevertheless, what each of these pilots went through is amazing. It's just that some of the stories were OK to read, but others from the book were fascinating...therefore the 3 stars. I do recommend the book to any aviation enthusiast.	2004-01-20

I was quite captivated by Davis' story of the Gambino crime family. The book is an excellent read, highly captivating, and fascinating. If you have never read any books about the Mafia or John Gotti, then this is simply one good book to read. I have read several books about the Mafia, so there are a few things I would have preferred. I believe Davis glossed over, too quickly, the early rise of the Gambino crime family. I would have liked to have learned more about the early crime bosses and would have preferred more background about how they got to were they were.<br />Only about 1/3 of the book covers the rise of the Gambino family and its godfathers. Therefore, I believe, Davis skimmed over much of the history to hurry and arrive at the Gotti dynasty. I believe, as other reviewers do, that there is too much history about Gotti; too much detail about his trials; and too much relying upon the infamous tapes.<br />Nevertheless, the book is quite readable. Read it if you are a beginning Mafia reader.	2004-01-15

I was concerned that the German translation would not come across well, but there was no problem. This book tells the story of the children of former Nazi leaders and their experiences after the war up to 1960. The son picks up the story in 2000 (or thereabouts). I would like to have seen a much more engaging update of the children's lives since this book was originally published. I think the son relied too much on his father's previous manuscripts. I would like to have seen more photos of the children as they appear today.<br />Nevertheless, the stories about Edda Goring, the Franks, the von Shirachs et al were quite engaging. It appears that Gudrun Himmler has had the worst row to hoe during her lifetime. She comes across as a very sad, embittered person who has refused to refute her last name. Of this, it appears, she has paid a heavy price during her lifetime.<br />The book has a good flow to it; is easy to read (light reading) and is certainly worth a read. You may not learn too much about these kids. I believe a much more in-depth study of these children would have made this book much better.	2003-12-15

Others have done that much better than I could. I bought this book because I love reading about the WWII avaition campaign involving B-24s and B-17s. In saying that, I was disappointed in this book. Neillands discusses the strategic and tactical use of bombers during the war and their effectiveness in bombing targets. This book doesn't offer much of a perspective from the American point of view. The USAAF comes across as &quot;second stringers&quot; in this book. Neillands gives the impression that the British Bomber Command were the ones running the air war.<br />Most of the text is devoted to missions flown by the RAF with supplemental references to the USAAF. In that respect, the book was more about Bomber Command than it was the &quot;Allied Air Offensive&quot;.<br />Neillands criticizes the air effort as, perhaps, unnecessary since the bombing was not very accurate. He gives the impression that the RAF and the USAAF succeeded in spite of themselves!<br />The book is worth reading one time but I would not read it again. Secondly, I don't think the issue of morality deserves a discussion in this book. The RAF and the USAAF did what was right at the time and we should not discuss history with today's moral views.<br />If you are interested in reading anecdotes about the air crews, stick to Roger Freeman's books or Stephen Ambrose.	2003-12-10

But, it's not really about &quot;The Finest Hour&quot; as one would expect. Rather, it is the story of several people up to and including the Battle of Britain. It interweaves the experiences of Churchill and his secrataries, Roosevelt, newspaper columnists from New York, a sailor, a few fighter pilots and the women plotters who plotted the courses of the planes. The book describes their collective experiences during the invasion of France; the evacuation from Dunkirk; the child evacuations from England and so forth. Their stories are told as a series of vignettes. (If you were watching this on television, you could see each story fade to black and then a new story developing). It does make for good reading.<br />However, the book really does not cover the logistics, the aerial fighting during the Battle of Britain, or the tactics of battle. In that respect, I was disappointed. I think the book should have been called &quot;Behind the Scenes of the Battle of Britain&quot;. Nevertheless, be prepared that you are not going to read about the history of the battle, but about a few peoples' experiences during the battle.	2003-10-27

I read lots of WWII history as a hobby and I was quite pleased with the book. It reads well and it's an easy read. Ambrose doesn't go into specific details about the campaign from Italy, but he does give you enough information to realize that these guys fighting from Italy did not have it as &quot;nice&quot; as the boys in England. Living in tents? Unbelieveable.<br />The story is based more around the exploits of McGovern and his crew and a few other personnel flying from Cerignola, Italy. Ambrose tells us, and they tell us in their own words, about their frightening experiences flying against the Germans; their fear of flak; and their experiences in simply flying a B-24.<br />The book may not be as specific as The Mighty Eighth by Roger Freeman, but it is, nevertheless, a very good read. I certainly recommend this book because it deals primarily with experiences in a B-24.	2003-10-07

At first, I was amazed at the predictions found in the Bible, according to Drosnin. Then, I began to question exactly HOW these predictions were found. Drosnin does tell us but I would have preferred a much more detailed scientific explanation than what was offered. However, I must say that all of the predictions were quite stunning and one has to wonder if this is all true.<br />It's similar to the UFO/Alien debate. There are lots of compelling reasons to believe in UFOs and aliens and then there are lots of books to dispute the topic. The same with the Bible Code. I did read an excellent refutation printed by Scientific American. After reading this article, I began to question whether the Bible code predictions were valid.<br />Nevertheless, if you keep an open mind, the book is not that bad. If you read the reviews which disprove Drosnin's theory, you may not like the book. Read the book first then read the negative reviews.<br />Shortly after reading this book, I was stunned when I heard there was an earthquake in Japan (September, 2003). Drosnin's book said that another, major earthquake was going to strike Japan between 2000 and 2006. So, I don't know what to think!	2003-09-30

First of all, I give this book 3 stars as it was not really one of those &quot;can't put down&quot; books. However, it was a good and entertaining read about the life of James Hunt. When you read this kind of book, you never realize what kind of life these drivers lead away from the track. Donaldson describes James' pursuit of racing glory from local club racer, through the F3 ranks and his entry into F1 via the Hesketh squad. This book certainly shows what racing used to be like in the &quot;good ol' days&quot;. It's a far cry from today's sanitized life styles on the current F1 circuit. I recommend this book as well as Donaldson's book on Gilles Villeneuve.	2003-09-23

Moody gives examples from many different people who have experienced NDEs. This book makes a believer out of me that there is life after life on earth. Moody doesn't try to sell his viewpoint - he simply presents the facts as they were presented to him. He doesn't try to sell the phenomena as brains deprived of oxygen; he doesn't try to sell any scientific reasons as to what really happens. He lets the peoples stories speak for themselves. If you know someone who is a non-believer in the hereafter (and may be dying), this book should make them less afraid of death.	2003-09-03

Groves' book was not at all what I expected. I was expecting to read about the personal and daily battles of the scientists (Teller, Oppenheimer and others) at Los Alamos and how they discovered, designed and built the bombs. This was not the case at all.<br />Groves describes in great detail, in Part I, how the government created the labs at Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Los Alamos. He discusses, at length, the political, social and economic ramifications of the project. He pontificates about the search for uranium in India and Belgian Congo and how he had to deal with the political forces (Britain and Belgium) when searching for the uranium. He describes the political issues of the labor unions and how the government avoided any labor issues at the three lab facilities. Groves does not go into great detail about the daily lives of the scientists at Los Alamos.<br />With Part II, I expected to read and learn more about inside details regarding the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Again, I was disappointed. Very little was actually mentioned about Col. Paul Tibbets and the others who made up the air crews for these two raids. Mostly, Groves describes the detail around crafting responses to these raids for the rest of the world and how to word their news releases.<br />Part III dealt with the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission in post WWII.<br />I found the book to be boring. The book, Day of Trinity, was much better. Groves' book is more suited for manager-type people of large corportions who might enjoy the behind-the-scenes look at management.	2003-08-25

I had just finished Band of Brothers and bought this book as a companion piece to Ambrose's book (to get a different perspective on the same theater of war by another writer). However, I was disappointed with this book. One of the critics here said the book read like a travelog with not much action. I have to agree. The book was getting a bit boring until the description of the liberation of the concentration camps at Landsberg and then the occupation of Berchtesgaden. These last two chapters made up for the rest of the book.<br />I did come across two passages in this book that mirrored two episodes in Band of Brothers. One was the description of the wounded German soldier who could be heard gurgling because of wounds in his lungs; and the GI's efforts to kill him with grenades. The passage was almost word for word what Ambrose had described. Huummm.....<br />Anyway, I agree with another critic that I should have read the books in order that Burgett wrote them. I won't let this keep me from reading the other books he wrote. This book was OK but was a bit short on substance and therefore, somewhat overrated.	2003-08-06

I don't find a need to summarize this book. However, I will say the book is excellent! One of the best books I've read about the common soldier in Europe. Ambrose's writing is superb - he makes all of the characters come alive as we follow their induction into the Army and their arrival at Fort Toccoa and their training with Capt. Sobel. We follow the guys to England as they get ready to depart for Normandy. The book continues with their jumps into Holland and later, Bastogne. Since we've followed the troops and have come to know them well, there is a sense of sadness at the war's end that these band of brothers are disbanding. The &quot;where are they now&quot; at the end of the book is quite poignant. The book is not heavy on facts and is somewhat light reading but it's one that is hard to put down.	2003-08-04

I was astonished at the number of attempted escapes by the prisoners. It made for amusing reading. I'm sure the Germans were fit to be tied trying to keep that cantankerous bunch of prisoners in line. The book is definitely a companion piece to the Colditz escape book written by P. Ried. Eggers certainly does make it clear to me that some German soldiers weren't near as bad as they were made out to be; and that the OKW did support prisoners rights.<br />My only criticism of this book is that some of the translation to German was not too good. There are many sentences which are quite long without punctuation; there are some sentences which end abruptly (need commas rather than periods). Some British terms were used which were confusing. For example, &quot;gaol&quot; was used quite often. This is a British term for jail or jailers. This book could use a re-write into American english. Aside from that criticism, the book is worth its purchase price.	2003-06-10

Jack Olsen's book is an exceptional review of serial killer, Arthur Shawcross. The book is difficult to put down once you get started and get past the first few narratives. I have two complaints about the book:  no footnotes or index ; no prologue which sets up the narrative style of the book.<br />The book begins with a narrative from Mary Blake, mother of the boy killed by Shawcross. Not knowing the history of the case, I assumed it was Shawcross's mother in the narrative. So, I had to go back and re-read the narrative knowing now that it was Blake's mother talking about her deceased son. A prologue would have helped to explain that Olsen was going to use this narrative style.<br />Nevertheless, the book is an exceptional read. I found it amazing that even the psychiatrists couldn't really put their finger on why Shawcross killed. One court appointed psychiatrist, mentioned at the conclusion of the book, provided an interesting diagnosis. Richard Kraus suggested that Shawcross had elevated levels of kryptopyrole and his chromosones were listed as 47,XYY. He suggested that people with this make-up have a higher proclivity towards violence, but that many of the medical community thinks this is bogus. Kraus's explanation does add quite a bit to the story of Shawcross. Olsen should have used him more in the book, rather than at the end.	2003-05-30

Keyser describes the world of motor racing in such terms that anyone without knowledge of racing could experience the thrills associated with the sport. His book would make a great film documentary. As one who has raced cars in club racing, I thoroughly enjoyed his book. I think he adequately captured all aspects of driving.

As a result, I also enjoyed this book. I believe the book could have been improved by not including the Lizzy Border case; the Bembenek story; and the Black Dahlia case, none of which many Americans are really familiar with. Douglas could have included theories about the more reknown cases such as the Green River Killer and the OJ Simpson case. The book is certainly worth a read if you enjoy the true crime genre.	2003-05-15

He describes how he and the rest of the players (Von Braun, Gilruth, Low, Kranz, and many others) came to be in one place and one of the finest teams ever assembled. Kraft is not always politically correct (thank goodness!) when he describes working with Von Braun, Scott Carpenter, and other NASA troublemakers.

I would have liked a bit more on the later Apollo missions, but, nevertheless, his view on the whole program is stunning.	2003-04-22

However, Schefter speaks more in detail about the rocket program (with von Braun), the Mercury and Gemini flights than he does about the Apollo program. The book is approximately 300 pages and only around page 210 does he start to discuss the Apollo tests and flights. In that respect, I'm disappointed that there wasn't more in-depth information about Apollo. I felt that he quickly skimmed over Apollo 8 - 10 and quickly concluded with Apollo 11. Nevertheless, the book is full of good information and is definitely worth a read. The book is as good as the other books on space that I've read (For All Mankind; Flight; Andrew Chaikin's book). Recommended.	2003-04-07

As one who reads WWII military and aviation history books for casual reading, I was disappointed in Boyne's book. I was expecting the book to read as a historical novel. I found the book to be very dry reading. The sections about the development of the USAF in 1947; its involvement in the Korean/Vietnam/Desert Storm wars was interesting reading. However, the story flow was interrupted by jumps to other topics which I felt belonged elsewhere.<br />As a result, I felt that the book read more as a textbook on the subject rather than a novel. I found that this book would be better suited for someone doing research (writing a report, e.g.). There was lots of information about current training; the politics within the USAF; the four major current commands of the USAF; current philosophy. The book is not for the casual reader. You may find the book to be a bore unless you are a hard-core USAF fan/veteran.	2003-03-11

I have to rate this book at 3 stars. Why? At only 230+ pages, I have to wonder if the book wasn't a rush to judgement and was not as thoroughly researched as it could have been. Basically, the book is a good, quick read and gives the reader an overall view of Bob Hanssen and his exploits as a spy. However, there are a few things that make me believe the book could have been better.<br />First of all, there was a lengthy dissertation about Opus Dei. Shannon never really adequately explained how the Opus Dei may have contributed to Hanssen's behavior as a spy. Secondly, she mentioned his interest in internet pornography. Well...so how did that affect Hanssen's behavior? She doesn't explain that, so one wonders what was the point of mentioning his interest in pornography in the first place. Third, as another reader mentioned, there are no bibliographies nor an index, nor are there any photos. I have to question Shannon's notes if she doesn't reference them.<br />Nevertheless, the book is worth a read. I think the book would have benefitted from a better psychoanalysis of Hanssen. ...	2003-01-08

Knappe takes us from his graduation from gymnasium (high school?) where we meet several of his friends. He describes his entry into the workers corps, and from there, his entry into the army. We see that Knappe is simply a soldier who is proud of his country and is excited to do his duty. Knappe describes his first taste of battle and the death that comes with battle. He is no longer a carefree young man, but now a battle-proven soldier. We follow Knappe through the invasions of France, and later, his descent into the frozen steppes of Russia. Soldat describes the horror and the futility of fighting in Russia. As the war nears the end, Knappe then feels the futility of war - the loss of his brother; the fear of dying; his realization that German refugees are now a reality. Finally, he describes his years as a prisoner of war - held by the Russians for 4 years.<br />At the end of the book, you ask yourself, \\"What was the whole point of war?\\" The human loss - the suffering. This is a fantastic book, and it would make one heck of a movie!	2002-12-02

He lets the soldiers tell their own stories and does not exclude any of the blood-and-gut comments. You get an accurate portrayal of what the invasion must have been like for the soldier, e.g., like what you see in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; - the blown-apart body parts, limbless bodies, etc. The book covers, quite well, the soldiers at home (before the war), their experiences in training, the trip over to France, their battles on the beach, and a follow-up. I certainly recommend his book to anyone. Any of Gerald Astor's books are good.<br />I did find one item unusual:  several times I found myself thinking, &quot;I remember a scene like this in 'The Longest Day' movie. I asked myself if Astor saw the movie first, then decided to write the book. Nevertheless, just a small observation. I would certainly read this book again!	2002-11-18

Graysmith identifies the killer early in the book and suggests, based on the circumstantial evidence, why Arthur Leigh Allen is the killer. This was, naturally, quite interesting. However, after he presents the facts, I find that the rest of the book was a bit of a disappointment.<br />I do agree with several of the reviewers that Graysmith repeats several paragraphs several times. Graysmith also assumes that you have read his previous book, \\"Zodiac\\", and are familiar with the cases. I read it circa 1987 and could not remember specifics today. Naturally, some of \\"Zodiac Unmasked\\" was a bit confusing because of it assumes you ARE familiar with the cases.<br />Graysmith could have done a better job of presenting who the suspects were/are and comparing and contrasting each based on the evidence and then eliminating them one by one. He doesn't really do this. He simply says that ALA is the main suspect and here's why.<br />Also, the two chapters on the Zodiac copy-cat killers in NYC and Japan were completely unrelated to the actual Zodiac case and therefore had no reason to be included in this book.<br />I think it would have been better if Graysmith had updated the original \\"Zodiac\\" book with this new information rather than writing a new 500 page book.<br />The book is worth a read-through, but it's not worth spending the $$$ list price for a hardback copy. I'd wait for the paperback or read a free library copy.	2002-10-04

I have to give the book only three stars for the following reason:  out of approximately 500 pages, only the last 200 pages were devoted to his flying experiences in wartime England. The first 300 pages described his experiences while learning to fly in California, Arizona, and Oklahoma. This portion of the book grows on you, but it's not really what I wanted to read.

Riveting!	Al Santoli's book, To Bear Any Burden, is a narrative of stories told by 47 Americans, Vietnamese (both North and South), and Cambodians regarding their experiences before the US involvement, during the US war, and the war's aftermath (after the departure of US troops). Each tale (from two to 10 pages in length) is riveting in itself. The book moves in relative chronilogical order beginning in 1954 and concludes with the present (circa 1985). Each tale is successfully interwoven with the next story such that there is a cohesiveness and a logical flow to the story telling timeline.<br />Some of the stories are quite stunning:  from the description of US soldiers being called baby-killers and spat on after they returned to the US [difficult to comprehend in this patriotic post 9/11 world] to the horror stories of the Communist regimes in Cambodia and in North/South Vietnam after the fall of Saigon [after reading theses stories, one should question why the US would want to establish ties to Vietnam].<br />This \\"straight from the hip\\" narrative is recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about the scenes from a participant's point of view.	2002-08-12

I found Sugden's book to be a very informative and objective analysis of the JtR murders. He very carefully separates fact from fiction and explains why so many \\"facts\\" were indeed ficticious. Rather than proving the facts to support his conclusions, he lays out all the facts first and then explains (in his conclusion) why some of the suspects were not really viable candidates. Of the four candidates - Ostrog, MJ Druitt, Kosminski, and George Chapman - he merely suggests that one, Chapman, fits most closely to the murder profile of the Ripper based on his objective analyses of the facts, yet he doesn't CLAIM who the killer was, but merely suggests. He concludes that even Inspector Abberline thought the killer was Chapman based on the facts surrounding Chapman.<br />Some parts of the book I didn't care for - the histories of the victims and the chapter about the use of dogs to hunt for the killer(s).<br />Nevertheless, with the objective reporting of the facts by Sugden, I am reluctant to read any other books on this subject... However, I definitely recommend this book since it merely states the facts and doesn't resort to any wild conspiracy theories.	2002-07-23

The review title is actually a quote from The Doors, but it is quite appropriate here to describe Hitler's last few days in the bunker as he says goodbye to his secretaries. HTR's book is very good. Initially, I believed the book was going to described Hitler's last days in the bunker on a day-by-day basis. This occurs only in the last half of the book. The first half deals with Hitler's court (Speer, Himmler, Bormann, Goebbels, Goering, Schellenberg, et.al.) and how they were handling the last days of the war. The last half of the book describes Hitler's last few days - his denunciation of Goering; his final betrayal by Himmler; Hitler's acceptance of the end; his suicide - all make for a very surreal ending when HTR describes Himmler's silly staff meetings just two days before the war's end - incredible. I read the 1947 version so there are a few suppositions which, actually, turn out to be correct - about Bormann's probable death at the Wiedenammer bridge - about Hitler's death and his capture of the ashes by the Russians. Great book.	2002-06-12

It was a review of Bob Morgan's life before, during, and after the war. He analyzes, with humor, his life before he entered the Army Air Forces; the search for love after his mother died; his baptism to war; the endless tour of the plane and crew after their 25th mission; his role in the Pacific theater; and how he handled life after the war. The book is excellently written and has enough humor to keep the reader smiling. But, there is enough to make one know that war was serious and Bob Morgan certainly lets you know that war is deadly serious.<br />He tells how war changed his life and talks about the treatment the soldiers faced after the war. Finally, he describes the ghosts he chased and drowned in drink trying to forget. And, he sadly chronicles the near fate of the Memphis Belle and how the US nearly relegated the plane to the scrap heap.<br />Just an incredible book. I highly recommend it.	2002-06-06

I have read many books since and have a fairly good understanding of the how's and why's of the war. However, reading Nixon's book was a real eye opener. He lucidates very well how the US got involved in Vietnam; the major mistakes the Kennedy and Johnson administrations made in running the war; the smear campaigns by the media against the Presidents and their policies; why Nixon bombed Vietnam in 1972 and mined Haiphong harbor; how the peace protestors played into Uncle Ho's hands. I was stunned to learn this information. Nixon was, by far, an exceptional and gifted statesman and writer. He even stated that the next threat to world peace and to the US will come from terrorism (this was written in 1985!). Nixon states that the \\"civilized world must develop a unified policy for dealing with terrorism\\" and that terrorists \\"may be deterred once they realize that by using terror they will spark the wrath of all nations that do not want to exist in a world riven by a tiny minority who have resorted to violence....\\" If you want to understand the current problems in Afghanistan with Al-Qaeda and O. bin Laden, Nixon's book has fascinating parallels from the Vietnam War to learn from. A book certainly worth reading!	2002-02-19

I started the book several months ago and stopped reading it because I didn't like the style of writing. I started it again last month and struggled to finish it. Herr's writing style is awful. He talks and talks and talks without really saying anything. He may described, for example, a soldier's fear in the jungle. However, Herr gets so chatty with his word imagery that one cannot really follow what he is trying to describe. His style of writing reminds me of Dennis Hopper's character in Apocalypse Now - constant chatter without really saying anything and not understanding what he just said! I would not waste my time again on this book. I was expecting something akin to Caputo's \\"A Rumor of War\\". Now, THAT book was good. I recommend skipping Herr's \\"Dispatches\\".	2002-01-10

Gerold Frank's &quot;An American Death&quot; is one of those hard-to-put-down books about the assassination of Martin Luther King. This was the first book I had read about King's assassination. I didn't know much about the killing other than that James Earl Ray was the purported killer. Frank does give ample time to all elements of the story - a) that JE Ray acted alone b) that JE Ray was framed c) that JE Ray was willingly duped by others d) that JE Ray never fired the gun. However, Frank slowly shows us how the evidence does mount against Ray as being the lone gunman. The book does an adequate job of suggesting and proving that no one else but Ray was the killer. I was very impressed with the book and its conclusions. However, I have a copy of a newspaper article that appeared in the May, 2000 edition of the Houston Chronicle. It said that Loyd Jowers, who ran Jim's Grill, testified in 1993 that he hired someone else other than JE Ray to kill MLK and that King's murder was a plot conceived by a late Italian-American Memphis produce merchant. This was alluded to in Frank's book (page 173) but nothing more was said of it. So...what can one really conclude? Nevertheless, &quot;An American Death&quot; is quite excellent and worth a read.	2002-01-08

Freeman's book is an excellent look at the 8th Air Force in England - from its first arrival in late 1942 to its departure at the end of the war. He writes so well that you actually feel as if you are there, riding along with the crews at 25,000 feet, in the harsh subzero atmosphere. The stories are remarkable - the fighter pilots; the Fortress gunners; the pilots remarkable duties while flying crippled ships - all fascinating. When the last of the planes and crews leave England at the end of the war, you can almost see the tears at this bittersweet end. Definitely recommended. My only complaint:  I bought the British version - the font is smaller and as a result, more print is crammed onto a single page as opposed to American books. (But, I'd still buy it again and read it!)	2002-01-07

Weisberg simply uses facts, objective observations, photographs, eyewitness testimony, and what was NOT said in the Warren &quot;Omission&quot; to prove that Oswald could not have been the shooter and that there were gross injustices done in Dallas. I am convinced that Weisberg is honest in his portrayal of facts. He doesn't attempt to answer who killed JFK; he attempts only to prove that Oswald is innocent based upon the facts available. I found the book to be very interesting. The first half of the book held my attention while my attention began to roam during the second half of the book. Why? Weisberg quotes too much evidence without the benefit of giving the readers a picture with which to make comparison. In other words, it's often difficult to &quot;see&quot; what he is describing. This makes the reading somewhat dry on occasion. I believe the book would have been much more entertaining had photographs of the evidence he sites been included.	2001-11-13
US	51761242	R3VUUEAF06O5UU	0671731963	759581157	The Longest Tunnel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Excellent reading	The Longest Tunnel, by Alan Burgess, was well worth reading. I found the book difficult to put down. His book is a well rounded story of the escape, its escapers, and the aftermath. Paul Brickhill's book, The Great Escape, goes into more detail of building the tunnel on a daily basis, but Burgess's book gives you a better overall look at what happened. Early in the book, there are a few chapters devoted to some of the major players; and it makes the book read somewhat disjointedly. Nevertheless, once one is past these short biographies, the book makes for compelling reading - especially his writing regarding the Gestapo pursuit and murder of the &quot;terror flyers&quot;. Definitely a companion piece to Brickhill's book.	2001-10-17
US	51761242	RJSHT1048JPQG	0140051821	193371878	Berlin Diary	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Incredible insight	William Shirer's book, Berlin Diary, is an excellent insight into the rise of Naziism before the Second World War. He accurately predicts much of what was going to happen from the fall of western Europe; the Allies kowtowing to Hitler prior to the war; the machinations of the Nazi machine. The Allies should have used William Shirer as the next Nostradamus - he was that good. Nevertheless, I just read the 1940 1st edition of Berlin Diary and he certainly gives the reader a &quot;you are there&quot; feeling. I've read lots of WW2 German history and I was quite surprised to read how accurate his predictions were. Well worth reading.	2001-09-17

I found it to be an easy and fast read and was quite informative based on the eyewitnesses who were interviewed. However, this is the type of book one would find available for sell in a school weekly reader. Lord does not gives us any real history of the ship prior to departure - he starts the book a few miles from the iceberg. He does not give the reader any real scientific reasons why the ship sunk as it did (flawed metallurgy, etc). Based on Robert Ballard's findings, one could prove that it was impossible for the Titantic to right itself 90 degrees from the surface of the water and plunge straight down (Ballard believes the ship must have snapped in half). Nevertheless, considering that the book was written in 1955 and lacking the scientific evidence we have today, the book was interesting and held my attention. It did an excellent job of showing the tragedy of the California not responding to the distress calls (a fact that was sorely overlooked in the movie, Titanic). I was also surprised to find that all of the female passengers were referred to as &quot;MRS&quot; so-and-so and not by a first name. Even the ship's roster listed the women as &quot;Mr and Mrs&quot; so-and-so. But, I suppose it was indicative of the times (early 20th century).	2001-08-14

Although lots of this information is somewhat familiar, it is brillantly linked into a year-by-year analysis of Beatlemania and well described by the Fab Four. The book is quite large and heavy, and therefore, difficult to read in bed (as I did). The only negative criticism I have is that the later years (1967-1970) don't appear to be covered in as much depth as the earlier years (it seems more pages were devoted to the earlier years). One interesting comment:  you can flip to any page and read about their history without needing to read through the chapter first. And, the book gives an excellent understanding as to why they broke up. After reading this, I better understand that Yoko and Linda were just minor players in the break up. It's also sad to see the &quot;boys&quot; (as George Martin refers to them) growing and changing into independent,aging &quot;men&quot; who no longer need the others for support.	2001-06-04

I was aware of this book since circa 1978, but never got around to reading it until recently. I was disappointed in the book as a whole. Hilberg definitely deserves kudos for his intense and in-depth look at how the Holocaust could occur. However, I would not recommend this book to the casual reader. Its style reminds me more of a law book or a research book with its dry tables and facts. I would use this book to cite facts and figures, but I wouldn't read it again. After the first 100 pages, I found myself looking forward to see how long is the chapter. If I do that, I know I can't get &quot;into&quot; the book.	2001-04-25

I found the book a rather incredible story of her life and growing experiences while hiding from the Nazis. Having seen the Anne Frank House, it made her book all the more compelling trying to visualize all she described. The first third (describing her flight underground) and the last third of the book (her last months in hiding)are very good. The middle third I found to be a bit on the boring side. Nevertheless, her writing prose is without exception the best I have read from someone so young. The afterword of the book really brings her experiences into perspective and makes the book all the more sad.	2001-02-17

He gives the casual WWII reader a good insight into the Nuremberg trials of the Nazi leaders and the other minor players of the Reich. Persico brings to light some interesting questions such as ex-post-facto law and the morality of the sitting Russian judges (who were just as vicious as the Nazis in their crimes against humanity). Overall, the book is exceptional. The only minor flaw is that Persico glosses over the trials/explanations of the lessor known players, such as Von Papen and Fritsche, for example, with only one page at the most.	2001-01-16

He described in accurate detail Martin's rise to power in the Nazi party to become Hitler's indispensible &quot;shadow&quot;. Lang describes in excellent detail Martin's beginnings with the Nazi party, his rise, his attempts to eradicate Judaism and Christianity from Germany, his behind-the-scenes manipulation within Hitler's inner circle, and lastly, Martin's death on the Invalidenstrasse bridge in Berlin, May, 1945. The footnotes and appendix are exceptional regarding Martin's death in Berlin. He proves, conclusively, through photomontage of the skull, dental records, and eye witnesses,  that the skull exhumed in 1972, was, indeed, that of Martin Bormann. Quite a good book if you can still find it.	2000-12-21
