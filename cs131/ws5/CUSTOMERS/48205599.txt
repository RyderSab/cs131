Boy, that title sure sounded great! A collection of essays about select scenarios where &quot;technology&quot; was supposedly the key to the success of the respective participants. Actually, little is spent on any analysis of such, as much is merely a rehash of secondary sources. Perhaps of interest to a novice Civil War student, or a high school class, but as honest-to-God history, this text has little merit. No maps, no footnotes(!) and a tenth-grade term paper bibliography will assure me never to purchase anything by Mr. Bacon in the future.	2004-05-09

Ayers offers a near flawless account of the initial years of the War for Southern Independence though a unique spotlight on two counties -Franklin (PA) and Augusta (VA). The &quot;everyman&quot; of each county is the focus of this tale -from the local newpaper editor to the local merchant to the nearby free-man-of-color. From the late 1850's to the opening of what would become the Gettysburg Campaign, Ayers examines, warts and all, the hopes, dreams and fears of Americans soon to be caught up in this dreadful conflict. Ayers is very adept at the many framing sequences which put the &quot;smaller picture&quot; of these respective counties into the &quot;large&quot; picture. This account is very reader friendly -Ayers assists the novice Civil War student with his framing sequences, yet those more versed in the history of the conflict will enjoy the micro-examination of Franklin County, PA, and Augusta County, VA. The focus is not Lee, or Grant, or Jackson -the interest is in the loves, the lives, and the sense of loss felt by the &quot;little guy&quot;. This is not necessarily a story of war, but a story of &quot;people&quot;. Well done, indeed.	2004-05-05

A collection of Mr. Ramsdell lectures, this modest sized account spotlights the problems within the Confederacy as a key to the eventual collapse of the CSA. Of interest is the fact that these ideas were first presented 50+ years ago, offering the reader a look back at the historical thought of the time (1937). Rather than dwell on now-tired themes of &quot;big battles&quot; or &quot;the big man&quot; approach, Ramsdell ponders the effect of the homefront as a key to failure of Southern Independence. With the families of the frontline soldiers suffering varying degrees of want, Ramsdell examines topics as varied as speculators, lack of salt (!), farms left unattended, and the Confederate monetary system as culprits in the demise of a unified Confederacy. Some charts, tables or such would have been helpful in presenting some of the information. Secondly, no sources or footnotes are offered!	2004-05-05

In this classic, Franklin in near poetic form, outlines a philosophy, and indeed, the psychology of the Southern mindset before the gunplay in Charleston Harbor. An examination of the &quot;frontier&quot; mentality, the code duello, chivalric notions and the plethora of military schools provide evidence that &quot;Northern push&quot; was soon to become &quot;Southern shove&quot;. This book can be easily digested by the novice Civil War fan, but may be of particular appeal for those looking at a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; rational for the Late Unpleasantness.	2003-11-28

Genl Richard Taylor offers his insights of the &quot;late unpleasantness&quot;. Unlike too many other popular civil war personalities who wrote first-hand accounts, Taylor usually avoids the name-calling and back-stabbing others seem to readily participate in. His immediate supervisor, Genl Edmund Kirby Smith,however, doesn't fare too well by Taylor's standards. Taylor holds Smith responsible for failing to allow him the necessary reinforcements needed to route Banks in the Red River Campaign (North Louisiana). Taylor indeed offers a unique perspective, as the son of Zachary Taylor, as well as having served in the Eastern and Western Theaters. A well-bred, highly educated man, Taylor's writing is filled with allusions to Classic Literature and military folk-lore, which is often muddlesome. Also annoying is the lack of ANY maps -a real problem when discussion of the various bayous, rivers and small towns fill page after page. Definately recommended for those of Confederate ilk - especially his remarks on post-war happenings.	2003-06-25

This is a marvelous effort which offers insights into the philosophical background of key spokesmen in the Disunion/Secession movement. Focusing on nine such figures (such as Rhett, Wigfall, Ruffin...), Walther weaves a mini-biography of sorts, along with discussion of the contribution these &quot;fire-eaters&quot; made to the fruition of their efforts - formal Secession of core Southern states, after the election of Black Republican apostle, A. Lincoln. Walther shows the how the &quot;abstract&quot; art of politics finally leads to &quot;tangible&quot; armed conflict - conflict which in many ways was given an intellectual basis by the writings and actions of the nine Southerners outlined in this book. As I often tend to more military oriented studies, Walther's Fire-Eaters was a wonderful sidebar! I recommend this book to all Civil War students, especially, of course, those with a particular slant toward CSA studies.	2003-06-07

This edition's use of large-style print was also a treat. His discourse on some key military personalities is very interesting - especially his take on Sherman. I never &quot;saw&quot; Cump Sherman viewed with these insights before! A new intro/preface brings the reader up-to-speed on the current literature concerning the Army of Tennessee to offer the reader a more modern take on exploits of A. S.

Grimsley and Simpson offer a brilliant collection of essays by various historians musing philosophically on the demise of Confederate States of America.

From the possibility of Southern guerrilla tactics to the role of women at the homefront, this modest-sized book gives thought-provoking slants to varied aspects of the final options/last days of the CSA. I would recommend this book for readers more mature in their Civil War studies. I think the novice reader may get &quot;lost&quot; in the name-dropping of battles and personalities.	2003-04-13

I'd be tempted to call this revisionism, but I really just find this to be bad history. Besides an obvious anti-Southern agenda, I don't know where the author is &quot;going&quot; with this. One page he bad mouths Lee-staffer Walter Taylor for deflating the number of troops Lee had/has available at a particular time - then he contradicts his argument by outlining those who are constantly deserting!@? Gosh, does Lee have the &quot;numbers&quot; or not? Likewise, Taylor is &quot;guilty&quot; of inflating numbers of Federals. Of course, Marvel then throughout the text outlines the outlandish amounts of Federal troops that were indeed available to Grant!?#@ A second folly is his contention that the FEDERAL troops were starving! Of course, this is followed by accounts of the Southrons having no forage and eating the ol' parched corn routine. Much like Wiley Sword's hatchet job on John Bell Hood, there is nothing Lee can do to &quot;satisfy&quot; W. Marvel in this inconsistent, contradictory effort. I'm sure to be wary of any other W. Marvel book.	2003-04-08

McPherson offers a generalized look at the &quot;battle&quot;, while offering many behind-the-scenes insights to the significance of this blood-marred day. The reader should be aware this is NOT a detailed account of the military campaign or any other such troop movement minutia. A &quot;big picture&quot; is developed. This is an excellent book for the casual reader or a novice in Antietam or civil war studies. A nice overview which can lead into other more detailed military accounts.<br />This is my second read of a work by McPherson, and on both efforts I've been very impressed with his writing. As I've digested Shelby Foote's biblical efforts, I had no desire to read Battle Cry of Freedom, but McPherson display a &quot;comfortable&quot; style of writing, similiar to Foote. As I read Foote, I had the impression he was in my study &quot;telling me a story&quot;. I had the same feel with McPherson. His text has a nice flow. Well done, indeed.	2003-04-08

What a thrill for students of the Confederacy! &quot;Marse Robert's&quot; own words come to life in his letters and dispatches of the war years! The editors do a masterful job of beginning each chapter/section with a framing sequence, followed by the respective text of key &quot;papers&quot; written by Genl Lee. From simplistic &quot;love-letters&quot; to his wife, to stratagems dispatched to Jackson, Johnston, Ewell, et. al., the reader is given first hand insights to the personality and thought-processes of the CSA's dominant figure.<br />On a structural note, the book is set in somewhat small print. A handful of maps are offered. At 900-plus pages, I'd suggest this book for (obviously!) serious students of the war or Genl Lee. Perhaps one should first digest on of the many biographies of R. E. Lee before attacking this Bible-sized epic.	2003-03-22

Healtwole presents a county-by-county account of Sheridan's movements in the Valley. The &quot;witness&quot; to the destruction is the use of &quot;facts&quot;, legends, interviews, family letters, etc. A flaw is the generalized sameness of each chapter - &quot;these&quot; troops, led by &quot;this&quot; guy did &quot;that&quot; to &quot;those&quot; peoples barn, house, etc. While there is certainly many interesting anecdotes and sidebars without, the format becomes repetitive.

Both Confederate and Federal share the blame in Speer's sampling - from the \\"random\\" execution of partisans, to the more diliberate starving of Confederate prisoners in Northern prisons, to Union prisoners being held amid bomb-out Charleston! A nice final chapter gives a brief overview of prisons - which I found to be the highlight of this very short endeavor. Those well-versed in Civil War studies may find little new, but the novice reader will, perhaps, be taken aback at what Speer reveals.

Mr. Holt wrote this in his latter years, so Goodness knows how the years have treated his memory of things, although a fine editing job by Cockrell and Ballard keep things on the straight and narrow. Much of the memoirs involve Holt's escapades that have little to do with the war effort.

Fremantle's diary offers an interesting and indeed first -hand view of the Confederacy during his brief tenure in the Southern states.

Once I finished this marvelous account, I did, though, wonder what his diary would have been like if he'd begun his journey in more Northern climes. It is most interesting to see his natural European bias show at times - his usual disdain for the Dutch and Germans of Pennsylvania, and of course, his affinity for the Southern aristocracy of which as a Brit he is well versed.Also of note is the fact that this account was published shortly after his travels - hence, we see no post-war agenda being served like many other after-the-fact memoirs and such.

Although Rogers presents the city of Montgomery as a &quot;microcosm&quot; of other Southern cities, I find Rogers offers little to defend his thesis. Except for its &quot;15 minutes&quot; as the capital, Montgomery, for the most part, largely escapes the ravages of other towns/cities/villages of the Deep South.

Indeed, Taylor has rightful claim to his judgements, as his acquaitance with Lee offered him first-hand knowledge of events. However, I caution future readers that this is NOT a memoir or diary per se - Taylor rarely gives any unique slants to anything, and more often than not, seems occupied with setting the &quot;numbers straight&quot; - many, many, many tables and charts are provided giving the numbers available for this battle and that battle, etc...I suggest this book only for serious students of the war - and more particularly, those wanting &quot;first-hand&quot; data on &quot;numbers.&quot; Of final interest, though, is Taylor's disdain for Hiram U. Grant (accurately recognizing Grant as a true butcher - merely throwing big numbers at an under-manned, under-supllied army) and the insertion of a speech given upon the anniversary of Genl Lee's birthday (albeit NOT written, or presented by Taylor himself)	2002-11-24

Sorrel offers a look at the War for Southern Independence throught the experiences of his years as a staff member for some of the Confederacy's top brass - more to the point, Genl James Longstreet. Indeed, the reader is reminded that this account is NOT a war-account per se, nor a review of military actions. At best it is a somewhat rambling, though very coherent series of musings on a variety of topics. There is however, a light-hearted tone to the memoirs. G. Moxley rarely has a &quot;bad&quot; thing to say about anyone - he certainly seems to have no agenda, as those other writers of the postwar years who tried to settle their accounts by writing their own venomous, more mean-spirited versions of events to cast themselves in a better light. Finally, I'd suggest this for more versed readers of Civil War lore. Sorrel's constant &quot;name-dropping&quot; or battle references are quite meaningless to a novice student. Also of interest is to witness the writing style (vernacular) from that period. The flowery speech, sentence structure, etc., is an experience as well. It is reprinted in the &quot;original&quot; format as first published - another twist! You get the real &quot;feel&quot; of reading this as if it WAS just published.

Mr Horigan's detailed report shows the other side of the Andersonville(Ga) coin - the Northern prison at Elmira! While gut reaction to civil war prison life makes one usually think of the horrors of the Georgia settlement, Horigan deftly outlines the shameful treatment of Confederate prisoners at this installation in an area relatively untouched by the hardships of war. While one could argue many \\"excuses\\" for the ill-treatment of Federal troop at Andersonville, Horigan details that NO excuse could exist for the probably deliberate hardships suffered by those at Elmira. Adequate transportation and abundant food existed in the surrounding area, but little was done to offer humane treatment to the incarcerated. Horigan attempts to \\"name names\\" and offers insights into the real \\"villains\\" in this shameful episode.<br />Although the text reads a bit static or flat, Horigan makes his points with emphasis. The last chapter summary is well done, too. I'd have like a map or sketch of the grounds and environs, however.	2002-07-08

As a true son of the South, I took a deep breath when I plunged into my first Grant biography. I must admit I completed Mr. Smith's effort with a new appreciation for this wonderfully flawed man. The sections on Grant's formative years and the Civil War chapters move with a nice pace. Smith's inspection of ol' Sam's days in the Executive Office offer a different twist - he portrays Grant as a near-&quot;enlightened&quot; leader, witnessed by Grant's attempts to ease relations with various Indian factions, as well as attempting to champion the burdens of the freedmen. He does, quite fairly, take Grant to task for the myriad of scandals left at his doorstep. Well done, and a nice intro into any further study of &quot;Unconditional Surrender...	2002-07-03

McWhiney and Jamieson offer their perspective on the South's stratagems during the Civil War with emphasis on two main points: the efficacy of the rifled musket and the lessons (oft times the &quot;wrong&quot; ones) learned during the Mexican War. The role of infantry, artillery and cavalry are outlined, with, as a nice touch, a summarizing/concluding paragraph at the end of each chapter. The final chapter, which logics the South's &quot;Celtic&quot; war-like traditions, I found a bit of a stretch.	2002-06-21

I've been immersed in my Civil War studies for about 2 years,  and Waugh/Mc Pherson's effort is an absolute joy. The life and times of key (and minor) personalities of this particular graduating class are spotlighted through their studies at West Point, Mexican/Indian War exploits and sorrowfully, to the final conflict of America's Civil War. One of the true instances where one &quot;cannot put the book down&quot;. Highly recommended, indeed.	2002-06-20

Davis	Mr. Cooper has appeared to have written the definitive biography of the somewhat reluctant leader of the Confederacy. I purchased this book with the realization I knew relatively nothing about Mr Davis' career. It is certainly an eye-opening tale. I applaud the fact that Mr Cooper offers a more sympathetic view to this grossly misunderstood man. A certifiable hero of the Mexican War,and innovative Secretary of War, Mr. Davis indeed had to conquer his personal demons as well as the &quot;enemies at the gate&quot;, in the guise of other Southern malcontents like Louis Wigfall of Texas, and Robert Toombs of Georgia.  Mr. Cooper accurately portrays Jefferson Davis as, in essence, a man who was fighting a losing battle from the beginning.	2002-06-20

Lowry offers a serious, yet oft times tongue-in-cheek look at the sexual behavior(s) of Civil War participants. From addresses of Washington area brothels, to medical examination forms, from excerpts from Walt Whitman's \\"love diary\\" to insights into the \\"self-help\\" manuals of the times, Lowry explores just about all aspects of sexuality during the era. Of course, some readers may be offended by the use of graphic language, but indeed, this IS a story about sex!	2002-06-14

Oddly, the whole tale is outlined in the excerpt printed on the back cover! Johnny Reb was pretty much on his own, while the Northern troops had the advantages of the railways, and other means of  transportation at their disposal. That is pretty much it! Granted, the late Fr. Holberton offers many &quot;eye-witness&quot; accounts of the trials and travails of the wanderings of both Federal and Confederate soldiers, yet even these become repetitive in their sameness.<br />On a more structural note, the format offers relatively big print, and only 150 pages of readable text.	2002-06-13

I've enjoyed a good many of Mr. Davis' Civil War books, but I was less than impressed with this effort. For one, it is more of a political history of sorts - little mention of battles or military intrigues for example. An opening section concerning the \\"founding fathers-like\\" atmosphere of the Montgomery sessions was of interest, but thereafter the text mires in tedium. Davis seems merely to dwell on the negative back-biting political skirmishes of the important personages of the times - Wigfall, Toombs, Rhett, et al. Perhaps a better title would have been \\"A History of DISSENT Within the Confederate States\\". I will certainly be very wary of any future work done by Mr. Davis.<br />There was very little I learned reading this book.	2002-06-09

Pfanz offers a most credible account of the life and times of one of the \\"lesser\\" lights of the Confederate pantheon. While indeed \\"Baldy Dick\\" lacks the nobility of Genl Lee or the exciting eccentricity of Thom Jackson, this offering serves the good general well. I found the author pretty balanced in his recitation of Ewell's trials and tribulation, be it in the realm of military action or his personal life. While this text is 500+ pages of small print, those with a particular interest in Confederate military lore will appreciate author Pfanz's efforts to bring Richard Stoddert Ewell to life...	2002-04-13

Winik's April 1865 is an absolute treat for the novice reader or those with a more critical eye. Winik weaves his premise carefully and his on-the-mark persuasive style offers that rare style of writing where it indeed appears the author is in your parlor having a conversation with you! Wonderful blend of style and substance. His well-planned digressions keep the pace fluid and fanciful. Winik's style gives me the same \\"warmth\\" I felt when reading Shelby Foote's accounts. I recommend this book in the strongest possible terms.	2002-04-13

I first read and reviewed this five years. Further research into this topic, including a tenure as a book review consultant for three national civil war publications, force me to recant anything 'good' I ever said about this work. This is pure character assassination. Winston Groom's Shrouds of Glory offer a more deft, wide-range analysis of this tragic tale.

Indeed, nearly every paragraph details an \\"eyewitness\\" account of the hardships of  Southern whites, the new \\"Freedmen\\" and the \\"carpet-bagging\\" Northerners experienced as Dixie went through the death throes of defeat and initial attempts at Reconstruction. Diaries, letters, and news-sources of the day provide credible evidence for the story the Goodrich's tell. As a somewhat \\"serious\\" student of the Southern War for Independence, I was not too aghast at the tales of woe portrayed. However, this book is a wonderful sociological look at the mindset of those participants of a recovering Dixie.<br />Despite the somewhat small print, the book includes many pictures and the 257 text pages are divided into 23 chapters, making the book very easy to \\"put down and pick up\\" without too much loss of continuity.	2002-03-19

Despite this being a most scholarly endeavor, I found the pacing and styling most reader-friendly. Of course, one often gets confused by the details of &quot;this brigade&quot; and &quot;that division&quot;, and the constant name-dropping of commanders can get one dizzy at times. None of this however, subtracts from my enjoyment of this marvelous account. <br />Although I am a Secesh-er, I applaud Mr Sears attempt to try to give &quot;Fightin'&quot; Joe Hooker his due. As often happens in &quot;these&quot; types of events, Sears does to some degree, maintain that Hooker was NOT the usual blue-clad buffoon that marred Yankee efforts throughout the early stages of the war. Perhap Hooker was indeed the victim of the &quot;fog of war&quot; disease that even bested Thomas J Jackson during the Seven Days. I'm now willing to look at Joe Hooker in a more tolerant light.<br />On a more structural note, the hardcover is complete with many helpful maps, and the appendices contains order(s)of battle and casualties records. Caution - text is somewhat small print!	2002-02-11

This account almost appears like it was written for a juvenile audience. Indeed, the preface denotes hope that it will serve as an &quot;inspiration to the youth of today&quot;. Hence, keep in mind this is not a very scholarly read - although a glossary of artillery terms and diagrams is very helpful. Nice starter text, but this effort by Mr Hassler wasn't quite what I wanted - nor expected.	2002-02-11

Lee has Freeman.<BR>Hitler has Kershaw.<BR>Jackson now has Robertson.<br />This is an absolute masterful account of one of the greatest figures in American military history. Indeed, the title of the book is not merely poetic license! Mr Robertson develops all aspects of Thomas Jackson throughout the course of this Bible-sized epic.<br />Certainly, as with anything of this length, at times the text drags. The pinball-like movements from this town to that village to this city to cross that ford near that creek (see what I mean!) get a bit confusing, as does trying to monitor the movements of the 23rd \\"this\\" division and the 5th \\"that\\" brigade.

It offers a nice mix of storylines from both Union and Confederate perspectives. Maps abound to assist the text pertaining to various battles/troop movements. A word of caution, however - these essays have been collected from past issues of Military History Quarterly. This may explain why no notes or bibliographies are offered. Many of these offerings present novel twists on Civil War subjects - Lincoln's genius with the English language, Charles Stone's ordeal with the Federal legislature and Nathan Bedford Forrest's role at Ft. Pillow are just three of 30+ topics brought to bear. Finally, on a structural note, this book is 500+ pages of somewhat small print.	2001-12-23

If you've read a few of these soldier accounts, you will quickly notice the ho-hum pattern of text that detail &quot;terrible musketry&quot; and &quot;cooking three days rations&quot; and &quot; ___ was shot right next to me&quot;. Granted, the prison escapades have some merit.<br />I'd suggest Carlton McCarthy's DETAILED MINUTIAE OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE and John Billings' HARDTACK AND COFFEE.

Mr Wert's book offers a nice introduction to the history of two famous Civil War brigades. I found the text to be highly reader friendly - largish print and not too bogged down in &quot;militareese&quot;.
