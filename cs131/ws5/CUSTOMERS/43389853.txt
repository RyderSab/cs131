Although most of the Star Wars novels and other literary spinoffs (graphic novels, reference works, and screenplays) are primarily written for general audiences that include adult fans, the sextet of Bantam Skylark books written by Paul and Hollace Davis is targeted squarely at a specific audience, namely, young readers between the ages of 10 and 13.<br /><br />The first three novels in the series (The Glove of Darth Vader, The Lost City of the Jedi, and Zorba the Hutt's Revenge) purport to be a continuation of the Star Wars saga set in a nebulous time period between the events in &lt;Return of the Jedi and Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire.  With the second Death Star's destruction and the deaths of both Emperor Palpatine and Lord Darth Vader at the Battle of Endor, rival factions vie for control of the crumbling Galactic Empire.<br /><br />One faction, led by the surviving Grand Moffs, has temporarily installed the former Slave Lord of Kessel, Trioculous, as the new Emperor, proclaiming him to be Palpatine's long-rumored (but never confirmed) three-eyed mutant son.  In order to achieve legitimacy, Trioculous acquires the almost mystical relic that is Darth Vader's indestructible glove and receives the grudging \\"dark blessing\\" of Supreme Prophet Kadann, head of the secretive Prophets of the Dark Side.  With the aid of Grand Moff Hissa, Trioculous then sets out on a multi-pronged campaign to secure his power...a campaign that has these three main goals:<br /><br />* The destruction of Luke Skywalker, the galaxy's sole Jedi Knight<br /><br />* The capture of Luke's twin sister, Leia Organa, not only because she's a leader of the Rebel Alliance, but because Trioculous wants to marry her and install her as his Queen of the Empire<br /><br />* The capture of Ken, the Jedi Prince who was found by Luke Skywalker in the Lost City of the Jedi on Yavin 4<br /><br />By the end of Zorba the Hutt's Revenge, Trioculus had made far too many enemies and lost even the grudging support of Kadann, and as a result of a falling out between the three-eyed mutant pretender to the throne and the elderly but still vicious Zorba (Jabba the Hutt's father), he ended up frozen in carbonite and placed as a trophy in the Cloud City museum.  Now the Empire is temporarily in the hands of Kadann and the Prophets of the Dark Side...and they are now unwilling to give the reins of power to anyone else.<br /><br />As Mission From Mount Yoda begins, the prophets -- really part of a vast Imperial network of spies and operatives who lurk behind the shadows and use bribery, sabotage, and even murder to make Kadann's \\"prophecies\\" come true -- have come to the conclusion that they will not give up the rule of the Empire, and Kadann, a dwarfish, bearded man dressed in a glittering black cloak, issues a Nostradamus-like quatrain:<br /><br />\\"When the Dragon's Pack,<br /><br />Perched upon Yoda's stony back,<br /><br />Receives a visitor pierced by gold,<br /><br />Then come the last days of the Rebel Alliance.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, and Ken are enjoying a much needed respite on the balmy planet Z'trop, \\"one of the most scenic planets in the galaxy.\\"  With nothing more dangerous than a plant-eating septapus nearby, the small group of Rebels is in paradise, relaxing and generally having a good time away from the war against the Empire.<br /><br />But when R2-D2 discovers an abandoned Imperial Compact Assault Vehicle on a cliff nearby, the vacationing heroes of the Rebellion find themselves starting off on a perilous mission to figure out what Kadann's quatrain means, starting off from the secret Alliance outpost on Mount Yoda on the planet Dagobah and including a destiny-changing search for a relic on the planet Duros, where the Rebels meet Triclops, the Emperor's true son, who has been long hidden in an asylum by the Empire.<br /><br />Triclops, whose third eye is on the back of his head, appearsto be a man of peace and rejects his late father's tyrannical ways, but Luke Skywalker and the leaders of the Alliance sense there's something oddly wrong with him.  They agree to take him to Rebel-held space, but do they dare trust him?<br /><br />Mission From Mount Yoda isn't exactly the best of books for older Star Wars fans who are curious about this story arc because the characters and situations are mentioned in Lucasfilm-vetted references such as Stephen Sansweet's The Star Wars Encyclopedia, but they are all right for younger readers who like George Lucas's space fantasy trilogies set \\"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\\"  The storyline may be somewhat apocryphal (since none of the other Expanded Universe novels seems to be linked to it), and some of the Davids' little running gags (such as the constant references to \\"zoochberries\\") are grating to adults, but the overall tale is entertaining -- think of it as Star Wars-Lite.  There is plenty of action and mayhem, including a harrowing encounter between Grand Moff Hissa and the Rebel heroes in a dark cave on Duros, and the characters, particularly the established icons from the film trilogy, are nicely done; there is the charming banter between Leia and Han, the earnest and compassionate heroism of Luke, the nervous prissiness of C-3PO and the usual eccentric bravery of R2-D2, albeit watered down somewhat for younger readers.<br /><br />Each of the three books in the second batch of Star Wars novels for young readers includes:<br /><br />* An illustrated list of the cast of characters, divided into Rebel and Imperial camps<br /><br />* Pencil and ink drawings by June Brigman and Dark Horse Comics' illustrator Karl Kesel, with cover art by Drew Struzan.<br /><br />* A glossary of characters and terms related to the book's narrative and Star Wars universeappears to be a man of peace and rejects his late father's tyrannical ways, but Luke Skywalker and the leaders of the Alliance sense there's something oddly wrong with him.

James Dean as a boxer's corner man in a Martin-and-Lewis comedy film?<br /><br />Gregory Peck as a Soviet partisan fighting Nazi invaders?<br /><br />Sally Field as a Lolita-like teenager on a Westward bound wagon train?<br /><br />Kevin Costner in a soft-core \\"T&A\\" film?<br /><br />Michael Douglas as an antiwar activist who joins the Army?<br /><br />Every career has to have a beginning, and acting in films isn't any different, as readers of Damien Bona's Opening Shots: The Unusual, Unexpected, Potentially Career-Threatening First Roles That Launched the Careers of 70 Hollywood Stars will discover when they explore this witty, informative, and even a bit biting tome by the author of Starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan and Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Starting with Woody Allen's appearance in 1964's What's New, Pussycat? and concluding with Pia Zadora's debut in that same year's epic Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, Bona, a former lawyer who switched to entertainment reporting (he has contributed film-related articles to TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, and Premiere), examines and sometimes skewers some of filmdom's greats (and not-so-greats) in their fledgling film appearances.<br /><br />Of course, Bona points out the good \\"opening shots\\" as well as the weird or just-plain-bad ones.  Take Robert Duvall's career-starting role of Boo Radley in the 1962 classic To Kill a Mockingbird, where he plays the oft-talked about but not-seen-till-almost-the-end of Robert Mulligan's adaptation of Harper Lee's best-selling novel. He is only onscreen for three and a half minutes (appearing 113 minutes into the film, at that!) and has no dialog, but he does save Jem and Scout from a vicious attack, revealing himself to be not a monstrous freak but just a mentally retarded man with the gentleness of a child trapped in an adult man's body.<br /><br />Many of the 70 entries deal with short first roles that don't add or detract from a film's positive qualities, but the more fascinating ones involve such possible career-enders as Sally Field's appearance in 1966's The Way West \\"as one Mercy McBee, a teenager whose personality is entirely defined by her sex drive.\\"  Who would have thought that this future two-time Academy Award winner (and TV's cute Gidget) made her film debut as a 19th Century Lolita of the Oregon Trail?<br /><br />Equally silly was Walter Matthau's villainous turn in Burt Lancaster's only directorial effort, 1955's The Kentuckian, a Western which starred Lancaster, Dianne Foster, Diana Lynn, and Donald McDonald, with Matthau earning fifth billing as a saloon keeper with a very cruel streak.  He clashes with Lancaster for various reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they both want the attentions of the lovely Miss Lynn.  Now, the idea of Matthau as a heavy is not ridiculous, since he could play cold and unendearing characters (as he did in 1964's Fail-Safe), but the idea of rumpled, New York City-born-and-bred Matthau as a villain in a Western is, sadly, rather ridiculous.<br /><br />Another surprising first film appearance, considering his later appearances in The Big Chill, The Right Stuff, and Jurassic Park, was Jeff Goldblum as  \\"Freak Number 1\\" in that Charles Bronson vigilante vehicle, Death Wish (1974).  There, the guy Bona characterizes as \\"an expert interpreter of neurotic intellectualism\\" has what the author describes as \\"one of the most unpleasant screen debuts ever, Jeff Goldblum goes through his paces robbing ...and... murdering.\\"  (I'll take Bona's word for it; I've never seen this \\"classic\\" vendetta-driven flick that started a franchise, and judging by the obscene lines written for Goldblum by screenwriter Wendell Mayes, I don't plan to!)<br /><br />Debra Winger, she of the sexiest voice (at least to me) in movies and star of the somewhat mawkish but enjoyable An Officer and a Gentleman, made her film debut in a soft-core flick called Slumber Party '57, in which six nymphets gather for a, you guessed it, a slumber party while their boyfriends are out of town. Winger (who omits this film from her official resume) bares her assets and acts poorly in this \\"sex-ploitation\\" film that Bona says \\"is definitely in the running as the worst film in this book.\\"  Fortunately, not many people saw this film, much less read the few obscure reviews in the Hollywood trade publications, and Winger went on to other roles until finally catching the audience's imagination in Urban Cowboy.<br /><br />Opening Shots is a light and entertaining read, and Bona mixes short star biographies, anecdotes (there is, for instance, a list of Hollywood stars who married co-stars they met on sets), and witty asides on the margins of pages.  Each entry is presented in alphabetical order and introduced with a major credits box to the \\"first film,\\" a still, and a Bona-ism (Meryl Streep's for 1976's Julia reads, \\"Already with the accent\\") which sets the tone for the short chapter.nymphets gather for a, you guessed it, a slumber party while their boyfriends are out of town.

US	43389853	R30QW882H7IVAZ	0451204158	562316613	Black Sunday	Books	5	28	32	N	N	Palestinian terrorists + vindictive Viet vet = deadly plot	Before Thomas Harris, a respected reporter for the Associated Press and ace novelist, created the creepy-yet-charismatic serial killer Hannibal Lecter in his novels Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal, he had already dabbled in another and even more frightening topic: a massive terrorist attack against a \\"soft\\" (undefended, usually civilian) target in his 1975 debut novel, Black Sunday.<br /><br />Like The Sum of All Fears, a Tom Clancy \\"Jack Ryan Novel\\" that was clearly inspired by Harris' tautly written thriller, Black Sunday's plot focuses on a plan by Palestinian terrorists to commit a deadly and spectacular attack on a highly televised event: the Super Bowl.<br /><br />The reason for the attack -- at least from the Palestinian side -- is a common thread that runs through both novels: America's unswerving support for Israel in the apparently never-ending Middle East conflict.<br /><br />And just as Clancy --possibly taking his cues from this novel -- would later do in Sum, Harris not only has a dedicated group of terrorists to carry out this diabolical plan, he has a psychotic American co-conspirator on board, a man whose recent life has pushed him over the edge from understandable resentment to psychotic lust for revenge against his own country.<br /><br />There, however, the similarities end, for whereas Clancy's obviously insane Marvin Russell was a murderous Native American of the Lakota tribe and was considered both untrustworthy and expendable by his Arab \\"allies\\" and was used as a mere conduit into the Denver area until the homemade nuclear bomb was in place in that Colorado city, Black Sunday's Michael Lander is a willing planner and executioner of Black September's spectacular plot to turn a blimp into a makeshift weapon of mass destruction. A Navy veteran with experience on both dirigibles and helicopters, Lander was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967 and spent six hellish years as a POW until the Paris Agreement ended American military involvement in Indochina and Hanoi released all the American prisoners.<br /><br />For Lander, it is his Vietnam experience that is the catalyst for his willing embrace of the Black September terrorists. Ostracized by his fellow POWs for collaborating with the North Vietnamese and discovering that his wife has had an affair, Lander is pushed to the brink of madness by the hostility his fellow POWs -- especially the senior officer -- feel toward him. Unable to cope with his humiliation and anger, Michael Lander resigns his commission and goes job hunting, finding the going tough until, finally, he is hired by the Aldrich rubber company to fly blimps.<br /><br />By now, however, Lander is plotting a most lethal sort of revenge upon the country he believes caused him to lose his pride, his honor, six years of his life, his manhood, and his wife. Inspired by the Black September attack on the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, he contacts the radical terrorist group, asking for explosives and technical assistance so he can convert the Aldrich blimp into a flying Claymore mine. The target: the Super Bowl championship game. The place: the new Superdome stadium in New Orleans.<br /><br />Intrigued, the Palestinians send one of their deadliest -- and most beautiful -- operatives, Dahlia Iyad. She spends a year in the United States, cultivating, evaluating, and becoming intimate with Lander, a man she knows to be increasingly insane yet incredibly useful to Black September's goal of making America pay for her support of Palestine's hated enemy, Israel.<br /><br />Harris takes the reader along on a transatlantic race against the clock as the terrorists make their detailed plans and get ever closer to accomplishing their deadly mission, while Mossad (the Israeli intelligence service), the CIA, and the FBI hunt the terrorists down after finding clues that point to an impending attack on American soil. Leading the hunt is Major David Kabakov, whose ruthlessefficiency at chasing and killing Palestinian terrorists has earned him the dark-humored nickname of \\"the final solution.\\" And as Harris interweaves the storylines of the hunter and hunted, the reader is enticed to keep reading to find out who will preservere....and who will die.<br /><br />Harris masterfully flashes backward and forward through time, driving the terrorist plot forward step by step and describing the American-Israeli collaborative effort to find Dahlia and her comrades before they can carry out their plan in minute detail, all the while examining Lander's long spiral into murderous madness. The pace is fast and furious, giving the reader an excellent example of a well-crafted suspense novel that not only never loses focus or goes into unnecessary tangents, but is also grounded in the reality of the mid-1970s. It discusses such real-life events as the Munich Massacre, the Vietnam War, the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, and the beginning of the spread of global terrorism. Black September, the Palestinian sponsors of Lander's plan, really existed, and so did most of the agencies and entities depicted in the novel, with Aldrich Rubber being a fictional stand-in for Goodyear.<br /><br />Black Sunday not only marked the debut of a master of the suspense genre, but it was also made into a moderately successful motion picture which co-starred Bruce Dern and Robert Shaw.Kabakov, whose ruthless efficiency at chasing and killing Palestinian terrorists has earned him the dark-humored nickname of \\"the final solution.\\" And as Harris interweaves the storylines of the hunter and hunted, the reader is enticed to keep reading to find out who will preservere....and who will die.  <br /> <br />Harris masterfully flashes backward and forward through time, driving the terrorist plot forward step by step and describing the American-Israeli collaborative effort to find Dahlia and her comrades before they can carry out their plan in minute detail, all the while examining Lander's long spiral into murderous madness.

Instead of creating his own possible scenario for a NATO vs. Warsaw Pact confrontation, he asked for, and received, permission from British author (and retired General) Sir John Hackett to set Team Yankee within the scenario created in Hackett's two<br />\\"speculative fiction\\" books The Third World War: August 1985 and The Third World War: The Untold Story.<br /><br />Team Yankee takes place within a two-week period in an August in the late 1980s. Since late July, a series of crises precipitated by the Iran-Iraq war has morphed into a clash between U.S. and Soviet naval forces in the Persian Gulf region. By August 1, word comes that NATO is mobilizing and ordering their armed forces, including Bannon and Team Yankee, to their wartime positions. Soon, the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact \\"allies\\" cross the Inner German Border in force. Team Yankee and the rest of NATO's forces in West Germany must then fight the invaders and stop them before the Red Army reaches the Rhine River. After that, assuming the Soviet attack bogs down, the mission will change from merely defending territory to taking offensive operations and pushing the invaders back. The question Coyle poses is, can American soldiers, using their weapons and tactics against superior numbers of Soviet and Warsaw Pact soldiers, defeat Russian weapons and tactics?<br /><br />Readers familiar with Hackett's macrocosmic World War III will know the big picture, but first-time readers will be turning the pages to see who wins, who loses, who dies...and who survives in this outstanding first novel by a true master of the military fiction genre.<br /><br />The only flaw, and this is not Coyle's fault, is that reality -- in the shape of the fall of communism and the end of the Cold War -- has made the novel's setting extremely outdated. Some of the then-modern weapons, such as the M1 main battle tank, have been since updated to M1-A2 standard, older weapons have been retired, and obviously there's no more Warsaw Pact.<br /><br />All in all, it's an entertaining read.s that reality -- in the shape of the fall of communism and the end of the Cold War -- has made the novel's setting extremely outdated.

When I do read books about Presidents, it's usually about the Cold War (The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khruschev -- 1960-1963) or specific events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis or that awful day in Dallas.<br /><br />Very rarely, though, do I read books about the personal lives of America's Chief Executives.  I used to, as a schoolboy, read very generic accounts of those few Presidents I found interesting (Washington, Lincoln, the two Roosevelts, Ike, and JFK), but as I grew older I became less a generalist history buff and became more of a World War II/Cold War/Persian Gulf War specialist.  Still, sometimes it's beneficial to step away from the familiar and explore uncharted territory from time to time.<br /><br />Kati Marton's 2001 book Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our History is one such sally from my familiar Stephen Ambrose/Cornelius Ryan fortress of historical reading.  It's a selection of 12 short biographical sketches of 20th Century Presidents and their First Ladies, with a strong emphasis on the post-Eisenhower White House \\"power couples\\" from the Kennedys on to George W. and Laura Bush.  (Ike and Mamie, incidentally, are not interesting enough for Marton to have a chapter of their own, and neither are most of the Presidential couples between the Wilson and Roosevelt Administrations.  Whether it's because those pairings are too bland or because most of those were Republican, I can't discern for sure.)<br /><br />To be honest, I found Marton's book to be well-written but not terribly engaging.  Maybe it's because the post-1960 couples are all-too-familiar to me -- I've heard far too much about how Jackie Kennedy thought her marriage was finally getting better by the time of that fateful trip to Dallas, or about Betty Ford's struggles with alcohol dependency, or the backlash to Hillary Clinton's \\"unlimited partnership\\" with Bill -- but I only really enjoyed the first two chapters about Edith and Woodrow Wilson and Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt.  I found the image of the seemingly cold and stern Wilson acting like a lovesick teenager when he was courting the much younger woman who would become his second wife, a woman who, if truth be told, was actually more of a co-President of the United States than \\"mere\\" First Lady as a result of her husband's debilitating stroke after World War I and Wilson's efforts to create the League of Nations.<br /><br />Because FDR's story dovetails nicely with my interest in World War II (and also because he was the country's first disabled Chief Executive, though much effort was expended to keep that from the public as much as possible back then), I really liked The Partnership That Changed the World, the chapter on Eleanor and Franklin.  Of all the First Ladies of the 20th Century, Eleanor seems to me the most interesting, considering that led such an extraordinary life at a crucial point in American history.  Homely -- a Jackie Kennedy or even Hillary look-alike she wasn't -- and living with the knowledge that Franklin had had an affair with one of her best friends, nevertheless she stayed by her husband's side -- if not in an intimate manner -- and became one of his socially aware \\"eyes and ears\\" advisers, particularly on issues of race and poverty.  Her newspaper column and many public appearances -- even in far-flung areas in the South Pacific and elsewhere during World War II -- made her one of the iconic figures of the era and possibly one of the most admired First Ladies in American history.ith alcohol dependency, or the backlash to Hillary Clinton's \\"unlimited partnership\\" with Bill -- but I only really enjoyed the first two chapters about Edith and Woodrow Wilson and Eleanor and Franklin D.

Beschloss' 1991 book, The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khruschev 1960-1963, is a literary rarity: a history book about a complex and critical period in the 20th Century that is so well-written that it reads like a novel.<br /><br />Beschloss describes the dramatic events of the period that began shortly before the Presidential election of 1960 and ended with the dreadful events of November 22, 1963, focusing on the interplay between President John F. Kennedy and Chairman Nikita S. Khruschev. These two men from vastly different worlds -- one the son of a self-made millionaire from Boston, the other the son of Russian peasants who had been semiliterate until his thirties -- held the fate of the world in their hands.<br /><br />The Crisis Years discusses in great detail the most dramatic events of the Cold War, including JFK's first meeting with the Soviet leader in Vienna, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the building of the Berlin Wall (including a photo capturing the only time American tanks and Soviet tanks faced off), the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that marked the first thaw in the frosty relations between the superpowers.<br /><br />This book is sadly out of print, but it's definitely a must-read for readers who want to know more about this critical period in world history.	2004-07-30

Although I've never even watched Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder's dark and biting satire/tragedy about the dark side of Hollywood, I have enjoyed reading Sam Staggs' riveting look at the making of -- and cultural impact of -- a bizarre-sounding film about a Hollywood has-been, a dead monkey, and a gigolo who ends up face down in a swimming pool.<br />Close Up On Sunset Boulevard: Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the Dark Hollywood Dream covers not only the nitty-gritty of the making of the 1949 film, but delves into the long partnership of writer-director Wilder with screenwriter Charles Brackett, the personalities of the stars (Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stronheim, William Holden, Nancy Olson), and even bizarre facts about the supporting cast (who'd have thought Jack Webb, Dragnet's straight-laced Sgt. Joe Friday, was into bondage?).<br />Staggs also tells the long journey of Sunset Boulevard from the screen to the stage, starting with Gloria Swanson's long and eventually failed crusade to buy the rights from Paramount Pictures and concluding with the almost Byzantine tale of how Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber finally adapted the story of Norma Desmond, Joe Gillis, Betty Schaeffer, Max, and yes, the dead monkey into a musical.<br />Staggs, who also wrote All About All About Eve, clearly knows his film history and it shows, but his prose is not without its flaws.  He blasts Wilder's Stalag 17 as being a &quot;misbegotten&quot; World War II satire/concentration camp comedy.  While he is entitled to his opinion about the quality of his movie, he is confusing his terminology, since a Stalag was a military-run prisoner-of-war camp subject to the Geneva Convention, while a concentration camp was under the jurisdiction of the SS Death's Head organization.<br />However, while I'm still not sure whether I'd ever watch either the film or musical, I did enjoy reading this 2001 expose of one of the landmark films of Hollywood's Golden Age.	2004-07-08

Roman soldiers, as we all know, didn't wear watches at the height of the Caesars' power.

Yet, as Bill Givens will cheerfully point out in his extremely amusing (and for some film producers, dismaying) collection of film flubs, some ancients were way ahead of themselves.  Modern watches, wedding rings and other anachronisms make their little unexpected cameos in such set-in-ancient-times epics as The Ten Commandments, The Viking Queen, and Spartacus.<br />Givens' Roman Soldiers Don't Wear Watches: 333 Film Flubs -- Memorable Movie Mistakes is a compilation of continuity errors, slips of dialogue, film-flipping flaws, and other unexpected mistakes that often pop up during production.  Some of them have been published in other volumes of his successful \\"Film Flubs\\" series, but quite a few are new.<br />Many moviegoers are by now familiar with some of the realities of filmmaking, such as the fact that films are shot out of sequence, that many \\"takes\\" of a scene are shot, and thousands of feet of film are cut and spliced together in an editing room.  Much care is taken to make sure the movie's final cut tells the story properly and that the scenes have no distracting flubs, but quite often things do slip by, even in movies that are considered among the very best, including Casablanca, Star Wars, Dances With Wolves, Pretty Woman, and Scent of a Woman.<br />Not every gripe is about honest mistakes (such as Mark Hamill's calling Princess Leia \\"Carrie\\" near the end of A New Hope -- chalk that one up to overexcitement in the actor's part and a temporary lapse in the sound editor's) or silly anachronisms such as a wristwatch on a Roman soldier's wrist in 44 BC.  Some are careless lapses in attention to detail, as in the Sound of Music when the Von Trapps are fleeing from Austria to escape the Nazis.  Instead of heading toward Switzerland and freedom, they are driving north, straight toward Germany.  Some are accidental \\"cameos\\" by crewmembers -- such as the guy with the handheld camera in 1989's The Fabulous Baker Boys, glimpsed as the brothers fight after a fake telethon.  Others are even worse, such as setting a film's scene in one season while it is quite clearly another.<br />Although most of the entries in this book are short -- often introduced with bon mots such as \\"How's That Again, Sam?\\" and \\"Is a Bird Bath the Fountain of Youth?\\" -- Givens does scrutinize big crowd pleasers (Apollo 13, Terminator II, Jurassic Park) in chapters with the heading Picking on the Biggies.  Here Givens has great fun pointing out flubs (such as wrong markings on the Saturn V rocket in Apollo 13, wrong dates and even the premature existence of USA Today in Forrest Gump, and just about everything in Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves) in some really big moneymakers and/or critical darlings.<br />Some of the strangest flubs, such as the switch in direction of the \\"blood\\" on young Indy's chin in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or attacking birds without shadows in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, are shown in black and white photos.<br />Givens, who is an entertainment reporter and TV writer, clearly has a love for the movies in general, so none of this is written with any mean-spiritedness or malice.  Like Damien Boma in Starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan, his approach is lighthearted and funny while at the same time being factual.  His intended audience is not, of course, the Hollywood insider or the technical expert.  Rather it is for the average filmgoer who loves the medium, yet spots such bizarre little things as California license plates in a movie that's set in Illinois (1978's Halloween) or a crewmember's hairy arm where none should be (Butterfield 8).ad of heading toward Switzerland and freedom, they are driving north, straight toward Germany.

What makes a good movie &quot;good&quot; or a great movie &quot;great&quot;?<br /><br /> The answer, of course, is, &quot;many things.&quot; You have to have a good story, a well-written script (ideally with memorable lines and lots of linear logic!), a director with a fine eye for detail and organizational skills that rival Ike's before D-Day, a well-trained crew, a well-versed composer, a top-notch special-effects team, and a visionary producer with a dream in his mind and a deep pocket to match (but at the same time have better fiscal discipline than some Presidents).<br /><br /> Have I forgotten anything? Oh, yeah. And you gotta have a good cast.<br /><br /> Let's face it. Until the late 1960s, we did not go to see the latest Michael Curtiz or Victor Fleming picture like we go watch the new one from Spielberg or, God forbid, the latest Michael Bay offering. No, we (or our parents and grandparents) went to see the new Gable and Lombard flick at the Bijou or Rialto. If you went to a John Wayne picture -- as millions of Americans did from 1939 until 1976 -- you knew he'd be either a stalwart cowboy or Marine sergeant or even a colonel in the 82nd Airborne. And, by gum, you believed him in those roles, even when he seemed (as he does in The Longest Day) a bit too old for the role.<br /><br /> So, casting is important, and many great movies are great because the casting decisions were inspired and sound.<br /><br /> Yet, as Damien Bona illustrates in &quot;Starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan: Hollywood's All-Time Casting Blunders,&quot; sometimes inspiration took a left turn at Sunset Boulevard and ended up in the pool with Joe Gillis' corpse. Whoever thought up the idea of casting the Duke as Temujin, the Mongol warlord better known as Genghis Khan (or Susan Hayward as a Tartar woman named Bortai) in 1956's The Conqueror must have been smoking something other than tobacco cigarettes. The sight and sound of John Wayne dressed up in Mongol warrior garb and spouting lines originally intended for Marlon Brando make one shudder. Suffice it to say that this picture was not a big hit.<br /><br /> Bona aims his acidly-witty verbal darts at such casting blunders as:<br /><br /> Marlon Brando as an Okinawan in Teahouse of the August Moon<br /><br /> June Allyson as a sapphic murderer in They Only Kill Their Masters<br /><br /> Tony Bennett in The Oscar<br /><br /> Robert Redford as a British aristocrat who, in real life, was also bald in Out of Africa<br /><br /> Michael Keaton as Batman<br /><br /> My personal favorite chapter is devoted to Gregory Peck, who was extremely talented but was also miscast in quite a few movies, including Moby Dick and The Boys from Brazil. Boma points out that most of Peck's miscasts did not come from his acting but from his voice and persona. In Days of Glory, a 1944 movie about Russian partisans fighting off German invaders, he speaks in a distinctly American accent. The one time where he does use a heavy German accent is in The Boys from Brazil, a 1978 flick about Josef Mengele and his plot to create some 90 or so clones of Adolf Hitler to create a Fourth Reich. Not only is the makeup overly done, Bona says, but Peck overacts, much to the detriment of the film.<br /><br /> Bona's style is both informative -- I had never even heard of Tony Bennett acting in a movie --- and irreverent. His chapters are brief (averaging at no more than four pages) and have clever tag lines (the one for John Wayne's The Conqueror is &quot;Mongol Cowboy&quot;) that sum up the miscasting's overall effect. Biting yet never overly mean, Boma makes the reader laugh out loud while at the same time wondering what some of those casting directors were indeed, thinking...or smoking.<br /><br /> Alex Diaz-GranadosBrando make one shudder.

The term Greatest Generation might smack of journalistic hyperbole or nationalistic jingoism, but the more I read the works of Stephen E. Ambrose (D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, Band of Brothers) or watch any of the documentaries about World War II -- especially on this 60th Anniversary of the D-Day landings and other landmark battles of history's largest clash of arms -- that will air from Memorial Day till June 6, the more I am inclined to agree with Tom Brokaw's use of that term to describe the men and women who came of age in the 1930s and '40s and created modern America.<br />Brokaw, one of America's best television journalists and anchor of NBC's Nightly News, not only coined the phrase &quot;the Greatest Generation&quot; when he wrote this amazingly fascinating and inspiring collection of personality profiles of men and women, some famous (Bob Dole, Julia Child, George H.W. Bush), some not-so-famous but prominent (Norman Mineta, Daniel Inouye), and some neither prominent nor famous yet vitally essential (Leonard Lomell, Jeanette Gagne Norton) who either saw combat, contributed to the war effort, or endured the hardships of being separated from loved ones without succumbing to fear or giving in to selfishness or self-pity.<br />In the same concise yet utterly convincing style of his network news writing, Brokaw draws the reader into his chronicles of 50 men and women whose experiences encompass a wide spectrum of the American World War II experience.  He captures, for instance, humorist Art Buchwald's seemingly unlikely stint as a Marine in the South Pacific, at first (and almost disastrously) loading ordnance onto Marine Corsair fighter-bombers, then more wisely reassigned to work on the squadron's newsletter and drive trucks. In five pages, Brokaw wonderfully gets the essence of Buchwald's satiric-yet-gentle personality, while at the same time revealing that the least-likely-to-be-a-Marine was given a parade by then-outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell.<br />The Greatest Generation is full of vivid personality profiles like Buchwald's.  Some, such as that of Len Lomell, highlight bravery in combat; others are like Jeanette Gagne Norton's, whose husband Camille Gagne was killed in Holland during Operation Market-Garden.  The recollections Brokaw presents here are full of drama and laughter, of happiness, love, and sometimes shame, but there is no bitterness or self-pity. For these are the men and women that saved the world from tyranny...and made our country what it is today.man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.

It also helps a great deal more if your friend is named Ford Prefect and is a roving researcher for that handy and impractical reference work, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Perhaps one of the best-selling references ever -- beating out the Encyclopedia Galactica and the memoirs of &quot;adult entertainer&quot; Eccentrica Gallumbits from Eroticon Six -- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy will be the repository of knowledge and wisdom even as you, like Adams' hapless protagonist Arthur Dent, criss-cross the galaxy in stolen spacecraft, wander through weird and exotic worlds (including primitive Earth), and meet strange and fascinating beings such as:<br />Zaphod Beeblebrox, rogue, con artist, ladies' man, and infamous party crasher (and President of the Galaxy!)<br />Trillian, aka Tricia McMillan, a beautiful girl Arthur had met at a party in Islington and went off with a two-headed party crasher who claimed to be from outer space before Arthur could ask her for her phone number.<br />Slartibartfast, the designer of the Earth, whose proudest achievement was earning an award for designing the Norweigian fjords.<br />Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, commander of the Vogon Construction Fleet detailed to demolish the late, mostly harmless Earth; a bureaucrat so rigid that he wouldn't lift a finger to save his grandmother from from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without going through a lot of paperwork...and trust me, Vogon paperwork rituals ensure certain devourment for Vogon grandmothers.<br />The late comic author first conceived this mix of science fiction/parody as a BBC radio series which was so successful it spun off five novels, a TV miniseries (which has aired here on PBS stations), abridged audio albums, and interactive software.  This Wings Books omnibus edition contains the five novels of the increasingly inaccurately named &quot;Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot; -- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the Universe, and Everything, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, and Mostly Harmless.  It also comes with a bonus -- but less funny -- story, Young Zaphod Plays It Safe.<br />So if you want to survive the Earth's demise and see the galaxy, make sure you are wearing something more substantial than pajamas and a ratty bathrobe, watch the skies for flying saucers, start worrying when all the dolphins on the planet vanish, and keep your eyes peeled for an electronic gizmo with the words &quot;Don't Panic&quot; printed in large friendly letters on the cover.<br />And for Pete's sake, always, always know where your towel is!r Vogon grandmothers.<br />The late comic author first conceived this mix of science fiction/parody as a BBC radio series which was so successful it spun off five novels, a TV miniseries (which has aired here on PBS stations), abridged audio albums, and interactive software.

The Cold War is over, and Communism is being rejected by most of the dying Soviet Union's former vassals.  Only a handful of die-hard regimes still hangs on to Marxism-Leninism, grasping at power with the grip of those who are about to die. One of these nations is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which rules the northern half of the Korean peninsula with uncommonly fanatical dedication to socialism and the discredited theories now being discarded by Eastern Europe and even the cradle of World Revolution, the USSR.<br />With a population of less than 20 million, North Korea has the largest per capita standing army in the world, with some 784,000 men under arms.  It is also a poor country, has little contact with the outside world, is heavily into the &quot;personality cult&quot; of the Great Leader Kim Il Sung and his succesor, Kim Jong Il, the Dear Leader.<br />Now, with South Korea once again embroiled in a cycle of student riots and apparent political instability, and with a power struggle between two factions within the Communist party in Pyongyang, the North Korean Army suddenly and deliberately attacks its southern neighbor -- an invasion that the United States has hoped to forestall ever since the July 1953 cease-fire agreement that ended the first Korean War.<br />Caught up in the horrors of war are Captain Mark Isen and the men of Charlie Company, part of the 25th Light Infantry Division.  Deploying quickly from their base in Oahu, Hawaii in the largest such operation since Vietnam, the 25th LID arrives in Korea in the wake of several guerrilla attacks against American personnel and a huge buildup of North Korean military forces across the 38th Parallel.  And no sooner has Charlie Company reached its assembly point when the radio crackles with the code phrase &quot;38 North Yankee,&quot; meaning the North Koreans have indeed crossed the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and that American forces are committed to combat.<br />Ed Ruggero, a captain in the Infantry branch and assistant professor at West Point at the time, made his writing debut with this engrossing novel that truly captures the heart and soul of the American soldier. Each character is described so well that he or she seems to be a living, breathing human being, and Ruggero takes us into the mind-numbingly terrifying and bloody battlefields of the Korean peninsula, describing night patrols, ambushes against armored columns, air assaults, and harrowing firefights in an amazingly realistic and honest fashion.<br />Ruggero went on to write a second Mark Isen novel, Common Defense, but for some reason he hasn't found the same literary success as Larry Bond, Stephen Coonts, or Harold Coyle, all former officers turned novelists.

I have been fascinated with screenplays and the art of writing them since I read my first copy of Carol Titleman's The Art of Star Wars, a trade paperback which, along with production paintings, costume designs, photos of models, composites, and storyboards, contained the uncut fourth draft of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. (This, by the by, was the first time I saw the new moniker for the film everyone still calls &quot;Star Wars.&quot;)  In that book, I not only read lines of dialogue and relived some of my favorite movie moments (this was before I owned my first VCR), but I also saw scenes that had been left out of the final film, either left unshot or deleted after filming (such as Han's encounter with Jabba the Hutt.)<br />Shortly before the premiere of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, I was stunned when I saw The Illustrated Screenplay and Terry Brooks' novelization at my usual bookstore.  Lucas had clamped down on the release of the Return of the Jedi novelization 16 years before (to prevent certain plot revelations from getting out too soon), and I had expected him to do the same with The Phantom Menace.  Being the dedicated Star Wars fan that I am, I bought both and read them as the soundtrack album played in the background.<br />The Illustrated Screenplay's version of The Phantom Menace differs somewhat from the finished movie.  It is essentially the same, of course, following the Naboo Crisis from the arrival of Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi aboard the Trade Federation flagship to the parade at Theed.  However, in an attempt to cut the film's running time to just over two hours, several heavily political scenes set in the Galactic Senate were nixed, which in a way helped the film.  Sadly, a few lines which I really liked, including one involving Obi-Wan and a shorted out lightsaber, didn't make it to the finished film.  (Other scenes, which were filmed but later deleted, can be read in their entirety and in context; it's up to the reader to decide whether or not deletion was necessary.)<br />To me, reading the screenplay ahead of the May 19, 1999 premiere enhanced rather than detracted from the enjoyment of the picture.  In fact, even while I was watching the much maligned Episode I (I think I am one of only the few non-Lucasfilm-connected persons on Earth who really likes The Phantom Menace) I not only understood what Palpatine was up to, but I could also see parallels between Anakin Skywalker's experiences and his son Luke's in Episode IV (which is set 32 years later).<br />The storyboards presented in this book are only a fraction of the thousands used during the pre-production stages, yet they give the reader a hint of the film's visual rhythm and energy. They are almost as good as the ones by legendary visual artist Joe Johnston, who worked on the more popular &quot;classic&quot; Star Wars trilogy more than 20 years ago.<br />For anyone interested in the finer points of screenplay writing and/or the strengths and weaknesses of the prequel saga, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace: The Illustrated Screenplay is a good reference.<br />Alex Diaz-Granadose reader to decide whether or not deletion was necessary.)<br />To me, reading the screenplay ahead of the May 19, 1999 premiere enhanced rather than detracted from the enjoyment of the picture.

July, 1945: As the scientists and military men who have built the atomic bomb prepare to test the ultimate weapon, an unexpected thunderstorm arrives at the Trinity test site near Los Alamos, N.M.  Lightning strikes the tower where the first bomb -- code named &quot;Fat Man&quot; -- is tethered, and in a literal flash, history is changed.  There are still two nuclear weapons left, but until the more complex plutonium bomb can be tested, their use is postponed until 1946.  In the meantime, the conventional operation of the Japanese home islands, code named DOWNFALL, is launched as scheduled on Nov. 1, 1945.<br />With this almost Shakespearean touch, novelist and World War II veteran Alfred Coppel (Thirty Four East, The Dragon) begins his &quot;what-if&quot; account of the invasion of Japan in 1945 and 1946.<br />Instead of covering the entire two-part campaign (OLYMPIC, the landing on Kyushu, and CORONET, the final landing on Honshu) in the main body of The Burning Mountain, Coppel starts his tale by dispensing with the aftermath of the failed TRINITY test with an &quot;excerpt&quot; from a history of the 1941-46 Pacific War, covering the strategy and tactics used by both sides up to and during the OLYMPIC campaign.<br />The bulk of The Burning Mountain centers on the March 1946 landings as seen through the eyes of various Japanese and Allied participants, including a Marine sergeant who is unsure that his platoon commander will perform well in combat, a B-17 crewman who finds himself in dire straits when his bomber is shot down, an American Ranger officer whose connections with a Japanese family begin to affect his perception of the war the closer he gets to places he knew as a child, and the Japanese soldiers and civilians who desperately fight to defend their homeland from the invading &quot;gaijin.&quot;<br />Basing most of his account on actual American and Japanese battle plans for the home island campaign, Coppel blends historical speculation along the lines of Peter Tsouras' Disaster at D-Day with some melodramatic elements involving the Japanese-raised Harry Seaver and his Japanese paramour; I would have preferred that the author would have focused on the invasion rather than sidetracked into the mind-bending Seaver storyline.

This little civics lesson, when added to the \\"main story\\" of how and why Anakin Skywalker becomes one of filmdom's greatest villains, was intended to answer such questions as \\"How did the Emperor take power?\\" and \\"Why were the Jedi nearly destroyed?\\"  (Unfortunately, for many Star Wars fans, this civics lesson made Episode I seem like a galactic edition of C-SPAN, with all that talky maneuvering and manipulating in the Senate Hall.)<br />There are, however, some fans who do like the intrigue and political backstabbing that marks the end of the Galactic Republic, and James Luceno's Star Wars: Cloak of Deception gives willing readers a fascinating look behind the scenes of those \\"baseless accusations\\" aimed at Supreme Chancellor Valorum...the ones that are distracting the Republic's chief executive just as the Senate is about to be bogged down by the question of the taxation of trade routes in the galaxy.<br />Set shortly before the events chronicled in Michael Reaves' Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter and Star Wars: Episode I, Cloak of Deception follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they investigate the daring space pirate Captain Cohl and his gang, who have been striking at the heavily armed \\"freighters\\" of the Trade Federation...that greedy multi-system entity controlled mostly by the Neimoidians who have allied themselves with the mysterious Sith Lord.

Or is he merely one of many pawns being manipulated by Palpatine/Darth Sidious in his endless chain of schemes-within-schemes in order to create a major crisis that will push the well-meaning but ineffectual Finis Valorum out of office, thus paving the way for Palpatine's ascent to the Supreme Chancellorship?<br />This being one of several literary prequels to The Phantom Menace, savvy readers know the ultimate outcome of this story, but Luceno is one of the best Star Wars writers, and Cloak of Deception masterfully combines much of Lucas' back story and symbolism (Finis Valorum, the Supreme Chancellor's name, in Latin, roughly translates to brave or valiant end) with a suspenseful storyline replete with intrigue, action, and a more detailed look at Senator Palpatine and his cronies' plots and counterplots that will culminate in the Naboo Crisis.Federation?

Take the artistic talents of acclaimed production artist Ralph McQuarrie and the writing skills of prolific author Kevin J. Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy) and you get The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, a coffee table book that gives readers a glimpse of the various planets showcased in George Lucas' original Star Wars Trilogy (1977-83).<br />Using McQuarrie's  production sketches and paintings for A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and other Lucasfilm projects (including the Endor-based television specials of the mid-1980s plus preliminary sketches for the 1997 Special Edition updates), Anderson takes readers on a grand tour of the most important planets seen in the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader half of the Star Wars Saga.  Starting with Tatooine, the desert world that is the home world to both Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke and ending with Alderaan, the planet where Princess Leia was hidden from her father and was doomed to be destroyed by the Death Star, eight planets are described in individual chapters, each told not by one omniscient narrator but by eight different observers, each with his or her point of view and/or political agenda.<br />For instance, while the chapter on Tatooine is an anthropologist's dispassionate and scientific report on the desert planet's hostile environment and its hardy inhabitants (ranging from the nomadic and hostile Tusken Raiders and scavenging Jawas to the resilient human moisture farmers and their homesteads), the description of Coruscant, the massive city-planet which was once the seat of power of the Old Republic and is the capital of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire, is a pro-Imperial propaganda article authored by Pollus Hax, the Emperor's chief public relations expert and &quot;spin doctor.&quot;<br />Although much of the artwork featured in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe has been published elsewhere (either in the various Art of Star Wars books relating to the Classic Trilogy or in McQuarrie's Star Wars Portfolios), this combination of production paintings and Anderson's vivid and imaginative text works wonderfully and adds detail and background to both the movies and the post-Episode VI Expanded Universe novels, including Anderson's own JedI Academy trilogy and Darksaber.rie's Star Wars Portfolios), this combination of production paintings and Anderson's vivid and imaginative text works wonderfully and adds detail and background to both the movies and the post-Episode VI Expanded Universe novels, including Anderson's own JedI Academy trilogy and Darksaber.	2004-04-12

Because the &quot;Star Wars Universe&quot; this guide covers is as vast and populated as George Lucas' &quot;galaxy far, far away,&quot; it's impossible for even the most prolific researcher/writer to keep up with all the new additions as books, games, collectibles and even animated episodes appear almost on a monthly basis.  For even though the Star Wars canon (read, &quot;official version&quot;) only includes the six filmed Episodes, their novelizations, and their direct off-shoots (such as the National Public Radio dramatizations and the Cartoon Network's Clone Wars miniseries), there are also tons of Lucasfilm-authorized Expanded Universe novels, comic books, and games (roleplaying and computer games) that have added planets, political entities, droids, weapons, spacecraft, alien and human characters that go beyond Lucas' filmed works.<br />In some ways, Bill Slavicsek's 596 page A (as in A-3DO, a droid once owned by the Jedi Knight Andur Sunrider) to Z (ZZ-4Z, yet another droid, this time once Han Solo's mechanical housekeeper, last seen recovering from an attack by Boba Fett) book serves as a &quot;poor man's Star Wars Encyclopedia,&quot; since the format is very similar and essentially covers the same territory -- down to the style of the entries -- as Steven J. Sansweet's more expensive and even more outdated (circa 1998) reference book.<br />The Guide is, obviously, a must-have reference work, and Slavicsek has done an excellent job at compiling all the data from not only the first four filmed Episodes (the cutoff point in this edition for the movies is Episode I: The Phantom Menace) but also every licensed media release, including young reader books (The Glove of Darth Vader), comic books (Tales of the Jedi Knights, the Dark Empire series), and such forgotten (and forgetable) TV offerings as the Droids animated series.<br />I don't know if there will be an interim Guide published by Ballantine Books before the release of Episode III next year; I had hoped to see a fourth edition this year that would cover Episode II and the New Jedi Order series after Vector Prime.  Then again, Sansweet's more expensive Star Wars Encyclopedia has not been updated yet, so I am guessing the next editions of these two wonderful references will be released in a few years.to see a fourth edition this year that would cover Episode II and the New Jedi Order series after Vector Prime.

Their mission: to capture an airfield (which the Marines named Henderson Field, in honor of Maj. Lofton Henderson, who had died at Midway) that, if left in Japanese hands, could have helped cut the lifeline between Australia and the United States.<br />The initial success of the landings, however, was followed by some of the fiercest land, air, and naval battles of the Pacific War. Japanese and American naval forces struggled incessantly for control of the seas around the Solomon Islands, and the U.S. Navy was unpleasantly surprised to come off as second best in some of the more famous fleet encounters, particularly in the Battle of Savo Island, where four Allied cruisers were sunk in one of the worst defeats in America's long naval history.<br />On land, too, Guadalcanal became a living hell for the Japanese defenders and the Marines holding a perimeter around Henderson Field.  Both sides endured not only the man-made horrors of battle, but also the ravages of life in the tropical jungle, including jungle rot, malaria, and -- for the Japanese -- hunger as American attempts to stem the trickle of reinforcements and supplies slowly but surely began to succeed.<br />Richard B. Frank's book, Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle, not only covers the events that took place between August 7, 1942 and February 9, 1943, but also deals with the Guadalcanal campaign's genesis as part of the overall Pacific War's conduct by both the Japanese and the Allies.  It's Frank's firm conclusion -- and the facts of the book seem to support his opinion -- that Guadalcanal, rather than Midway, was the true turning point of World War II in the Pacific.  The book is extremely well done and impeccably researched, making full use of Japanese and American sources to present a fully balanced account of this extremely complex and vital campaign.that Guadalcanal, rather than Midway, was the true turning point of World War II in the Pacific.

One of the reasons Star Trek has lived long and prospered has been its memorable characters and storylines, not to mention the way it has developed a sense of continuity. The sense that the various captains, crews, starships, even a space station live in a believable universe not only comes from Gene Roddenberry's original concept of setting his original series at a time when faster-than-light travel might be possible, but from script writers that had the talent and the imagination to create a back story to Starfleet, the starship Enterprise, the Federation, and Earth's \\"past\\" -- from the characters' 23rd/24th Century vantage points. By citing such events as the Romulan Wars, first contact with the Klingons, and the Eugenics Wars of the late 20th Century, Star Trek's writers create a subconscious feeling in the viewer's (or reader's) mind that yes, that universe has a history that is believable and adds much to the dramatic story's emotional impact.<br />Because Star Trek's writers chose to set the original series in a believable future scenario rather than creating a \\"galaxy far, far away\\" a la George Lucas, they wrote several episodes that dealt with what in the mid-1960s was still the future. Two of them, including \\"Assignment: Earth,\\" involved time travel by Capt. Kirk and the USS Enterprise to the Sixties, while \\"Space Seed,\\" by Carey Wilbur and Gene L. Coon, established the history of the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s.<br />Obviously, the writers of the episode had no idea that Star Trek would become such a long-lived franchise or that a feature film would be based on \\"Space Seed,\\" yet Khan Noonien Singh -- one of Ricardo Montalban's most memorable roles -- and the events of his era loom large in the Trek scenario. So how does a writer of contemporary Trek -- whether it is on film or the printed page/e-book -- reconcile what was the 1960s \\"future\\" with our very real and stormy past in a believable way?<br />In my review of Volume One of Star Trek -- The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh I mentioned that author Greg Cox (Assignment: Eternity) chose to focus his two-volume series not on the captain and crew of the NCC-1701 (although they have a relevant \\"frame\\" storyline that acts as a launching pad for the \\"historical's\\" main narrative) but on the efforts of Gary Seven and Roberta Lincoln to save Earth from a major world war as the now-adult children of the Chrysalis Project fight among themselves for world supremacy.<br />Obviously, the outcome (Khan attempts to conquer world, fails, and is exiled with 90 or so of his genetically superior brothers and sisters aboard the advanced DY-100 sleeper ship SS Botany Bay, to be found 300 years later by Kirk's Enterprise in the Mutara Sector) is never in doubt. No, the fun in reading Cox's novels is in seeing how he manages to blend Star Trek's established history with our own recent past.<br />After a 23rd Century prologue that continues Kirk's now imperiled investigation of the Paragon Colony on the planet Sycorax (the Klingons have sabotaged the colony and Kirk must find a way to save the genetically engineered humans' skins, as well as those of his own landing party), Cox returns to the 20th Century, this time during the critical early 1990s, at a time when the post-Cold War era is marked by wars in the Balkans and elsewhere, the rise of the \\"militia\\" movement in the United States, and all the other events that made the Nineties \\"a strange, violent time,\\" as Spock says in the original 1967 episode. Cox manages to convincingly portray the unconnected headlines (Revolutionary turmoil stirs in Peru; Ethnic hatred plunges Yugoslavia into civil war!) as part of the Star Trek universe's Eugenics Wars.<br />Volume Two is just as exciting and funny as the first installment of the series, with more action and inside jokes and references to the culture of the time period, other Trek histories (even Jonathan Archer gets a mention in this one), and even a knowing littlehomage to Ricardo Montalban's best known TV role (\\"Welcome, Miss Lincoln, to Chrysalis Island!\\").ittle homage to Ricardo Montalban's best known TV role (\\"Welcome, Miss Lincoln, to Chrysalis Island!\\").	2004-04-07

Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy), is the middle book in a loose trilogy which chronicles the eventful yet destined-to-fail romance between Luke Skywalker and the Jedi Knight Callista.  (The other books, Children of the Jedi and Planet of Twilight, are both by Barbara Hambly.)<br />Of the three, Darksaber is the best one, combining references to the Classic Trilogy films while continuing various storylines that take place in the Expanded Universe.<br />As Luke takes Callista across the galaxy on a quest to restore her Jedi powers, events elsewhere crop up to challenge the skills of his Jedi Academy's students. Admiral Daala, the Empire's only female admiral is back and thirsting for revenge against the New Republic, and the Hutts, under their leader Durga, are secretly planning to build a new superweapon based on the Empire's Death Star.<br />Facing these twin (and uncoordinated) threats, Leia Organa Solo, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the mostly untested Jedi trainees must stand firm and defend the New Republic, or face certain defeat.<br />As far as Star Wars Expanded Universe novels go, Darksaber is an enjoyable book to read, though it suffers from being linked to two books which I'm not particularly keen on.  Its strengths are that it has more Star Wars action and comes closer to the spirit of the movies than Hambly's &quot;bookend&quot; novels of the three-book arc, and I like the way Anderson foreshadows some story elements of the New Jedi Order series.  However, it would have been nice if Anderson had avoided the almost predictable storyline of &quot;the enemy has another Death Star-based superweapon! We must destroy it before it destroys us!&quot;<br />Still, Star Wars is not Shakespeare or Proust, and Darksaber is a quick and enjoyable read.	2004-04-07

Khan.<br />Although Star Trek has pitted its various starships and space station crews against such formidable antagonists as the Klingons, the Romulans, the Borg, and the Xindi, few of them have had such an indelible persona as Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically engineered \\"superman\\" who, according to the Original Series episode \\"Space Seed\\" and the 1982 feature film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, ruled one-quarter of the Earth during a period called the Eugenics Wars.  As Khan says to Chekov in Star Trek II, \\"On Earth, 200 years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions.\\"<br />Whereas Greg Cox's first novel in a two-book cycle sets up the whole Khan backstory (he's the product of an ambitious attempt by brilliant but twisted scientists to \\"improve\\" humanity by tinkering with human DNA) by mixing real Earth history from 1974 to 1989 and Star Trek lore, Volume Two tells the story of Khan Noonien Singh at the very height of his power, his failed attempt to unite his genetically engineered brothers and sisters under his banner, and his ultimate exile aboard the DY-100 sleeper ship he will name, aptly, SS Botany Bay.<br />Although there is a thematically-linked \\"frame story\\" set during Capt. Kirk's first five-year mission about the Enterprise investigating a colony of genetically engineered humans that has applied for membership in the Federation, Cox's main storyline focuses on Agent Gary Seven and Roberta Lincoln's attempts to stop Khan -- who had briefly worked them in their mission to save Earth from a third world war but then fell out with Seven and followed a darker path -- from blowing up the planet and destroying humanity. To tell this important story in the Star Trek mythos without having the 21st Century reader rolling his or her eyes and going, \\"Yeah, right. If the Eugenics Wars happened in the '90s, why didn't I hear about it on CNN?\\" Cox has incorporated the Balkan Wars, the rise of militias in the United States, the \\"Black Hawk Down\\" ambush in Mogadishu, and almost every major crisis in the mid-1990s and meshes it with Star Trek \\"history,\\" which thankfully was not very detailed in the 1967 episode that introduced Khan. <br />As he does so well in Volume One, Cox blends an exciting Star Trek adventure -- full of references to established \\"facts\\" and characters from various movies and series episodes -- with real historical events that took place from 1992 to 1996.  He slyly makes social commentary about our recent past and allusions to other famous movies and television series, including an homage to Ricardo Montalban's (Khan) most famous TV role.<br />The pace is fast and Cox's style is very engaging.  He apparently loves Star Trek and its characters, and it clearly shows in this exciting and entertaining series of novels. I strongly recommend this two-book series to Star Trek fans and even non-fans.	2004-03-29

Some of his novels, particularly 1986's Red Storm Rising, are even required reading at some of our prestigious military academies.  Four of his novels have been adapted into popular films, and a vast array of books (nonfiction as well as his novels), video games (Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell), board games, and computer simulations is available in many marketplaces, including malls, used bookstores, and, of course, right here.<br />The Tom Clancy Companion, edited by Martin H. Greenberg (the brain behind the seven volume Guided Tour series of non-fiction books about the U.S. armed forces) is a 1992 reference book that explores the Clancy phenomenon at the popular and critical zenith of his career.  Although it covers only the first five Jack Ryan novels and Red Storm Rising, The Tom Clancy Companion not only gives the reader an insight into Clancy's creative process and writing career, but also delves into the author's mostly conservative political views, both in the interview he granted to Greenberg and in a selection of newspaper columns written by Clancy.<br />To most of Clancy's legions of fans, perhaps the best feature is the A-Z concordance of characters and weapons systems that appear in each of the first six novels (The Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Patriot Games, Cardinal of the Kremlin, Clear and Present Danger, and The Sum of All Fears).  The entries are brief but nevertheless informative, and it is this feature that new Clancy readers would find most useful.<br />Want to know, say, about an A-10 Thunderbolt II and its close support mission? Or what a Typhoon-class submarine's dimensions are? The concordance answers those questions and others, although it is not as complete as one would like.  The &quot;caterpillar&quot; device that allows the Red October to pass Soviet vessels while running silent, running deep using a nearly silent propulsion system is nowhere to be found.  Such a glaring error is why I gave this otherwise excellent (if badly outdated) reference book four rather than five stars.t allows the Red October to pass Soviet vessels while running silent, running deep using a nearly silent propulsion system is nowhere to be found.

Schindler's List, Thomas Keneally's 1982 non-fiction \\"novel\\" about Oskar Schindler's transformation from a hedonistic bon vivant German (actually, Sudeten German, born in what is now part of the Czech Republic) war profiteer to savior of over 1,000 Jews during World War II, is one of the most fascinating accounts about the darkest chapter of that global conflict, the Holocaust.  It vividly portrays the horrors of the Nazi effort to exterminate the Jewish inhabitants in German-occupied Europe while at the same time proving that one person, no matter how flawed and contradictory in nature he or she is, can rise to the occasion and make a difference.<br />In his Author's Note, Keneally explains that he uses the oft-used technique of telling a true story in the format of a fictional account, partly because he is primarily a novelist (Confederates, Gossip From the Forest) and \\"because the novel's techniques seem suited for a character of such ambiguity and magnitude as Oskar.\\"  He also acknowledges the persistence of Leopold Pfefferberg, a Los Angeles leather-goods store owner and one of the \\"Schindlerjuden\\" -- the handful of mostly Polish Jews saved by Schindler from the SS by Oskar's use of his charm, connections with high Nazi Party officials, and ultimately, the fortune Schindler had gone to make in Krakow after Poland's surrender in the fall of 1939.<br />Like Steven Spielberg's 1993 Academy Award-winning film it inspired, Schindler's List (published in Europe as Schindler's Ark) describes how Schindler takes over a factory -- formerly owned by Jewish investors -- and makes a fortune selling, among other things, pots and pans to the German Army.  But as the war goes on and Schindler sees first-hand the horrible crimes the Third Reich is committing in the name of the \\"Final Solution,\\"  the well-connected charmer and ladies' man becomes more concerned about saving lives than making money.  First, he has a few fortunate Jews listed with the SS as \\"essential war-industry workers\\" in his Krakow factory; later, when he discovers that SS Commandant Amon Goeth has been given orders to dispose of every inmate and slave laborer at the Plaszow Labor Camp before the advancing Soviets reach Krakow, he spends all of his wealth paying Goeth and other corrupt SS officials for the lives of nearly 1,200 of the Jewish men, women, and children who form Schindler's workforce.<br />While Spielberg's movie faithfully captures the novel's account of the Holocaust years, Keneally's book gives the reader more details about Oskar's life before and after the war, including a short account of his prewar activities and his postwar business failures in Europe and Argentina.  However, Keneally's focus is on Schindler's inspiring transformation from shameless and charming entrepreneur to \\"Righteous Person,\\" proving that decency and righteousness can triumph over even the most implacable tyranny and hatred.y workers\\" in his Krakow factory; later, when he discovers that SS Commandant Amon Goeth has been given orders to dispose of every inmate and slave laborer at the Plaszow Labor Camp before the advancing Soviets reach Krakow, he spends all of his wealth paying Goeth and other corrupt SS officials for the lives of nearly 1,200 of the Jewish men, women, and children who form Schindler's workforce.<br />While Spielberg's movie faithfully captures the novel's account of the Holocaust years, Keneally's book gives the reader more details about Oskar's life before and after the war, including a short account of his prewar activities and his postwar business failures in Europe and Argentina.

Nowadays, the title &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; conjures up images from a trilogy of films which began with Steven Spielberg's apatosaurus-sized blockbuster and started going (quality-wise, at least) down the path to cinematic extinction with wan sequels (The Lost World, Jurassic Park III -- the latter, thank Gene Siskel's soul, NOT directed by Spielberg). This, of course, is to be expected and is not exactly a new concept in Hollywood; Jaws, which was Spielberg's first real blockbuster (and is in fact the grandfather of the modern &quot;monster hit movie&quot;) also started out as a decent horror film about a predator with sharp teeth that, um, snacked on people...and should have, like its 1993 cinematic heir, should have been left as a stand-alone film.<br />What some people tend to forget is that both these franchise-starting Spielberg films were adaptations of best-selling summer-season beach reads (Jaws, for instance, was written by Peter Benchley).  Not meant to be literary classics in the same category as, say, the collected works of William Shakespeare or Ernest Hemingway, Benchley's shark novel and Michael Crichton's original 1990 novel, Jurassic Park, are an entertaining -- if easily disposed of -- mix of science, horror, and melodrama.<br />Crichton's novel contains the same basic premise as the screenplay he later co-wrote with David Koepp (The Lost World): eccentric billionaire John Hammond, through his huge bio-genetics company InGen, funds a top secret scientific project to clone dinosaurs from fossilized DNA and populate the Mother of All Theme Attractions, Jurassic Park. But after a series of incidents that Hammond manages to keep hidden from public view (velociraptors snack on unsuspecting Costa Rican laborers, for instance), InGen's board of directors sends attorney Donald Gennaro and a team of independent observers to inspect Hammond's theme park on Isla Nublar off the coast of Costa Rica.  Their mission: to evaluate Jurassic Park's safety measures and its viability as a money-making tourist attraction.<br />As in the movie, everything that can go wrong, does, especially as a result of a deliberate act of computerized sabotage by greedy and super-geeky Dennis Nedry, who has been hired by InGen's rival Biosys Inc. to steal some dino-embryos from Jurassic Park's cryogenic storage facilities. This, of course, places Gennaro's team of  Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm in peril (along with Hammond's two grandchildren, Tim and Lex) as they get stranded outside without the protection of the Park's electrified fences.  And, as in the movie, the main characters learn one simple yet painful lesson: people and dinosaurs shouldn't mix.<br />Crichton's novel is far darker than its 1993 film adaptation, with more nods to Stephen King than to Steven Spielberg, with more scenes of gore and violent death than would have been viable for a PG-13 film.  Nevertheless, it's entertaining without being too bogged down in the nitty-gritty details of genetic engineering, industrial espionage, or computer sciences, although Crichton, as he has done in other works (The Terminal Man, The Andromeda Strain) touches all these topics in this fast-moving techno-chiller.and its viability as a money-making tourist attraction.<br />As in the movie, everything that can go wrong, does, especially as a result of a deliberate act of computerized sabotage by greedy and super-geeky Dennis Nedry, who has been hired by InGen's rival Biosys Inc. to steal some dino-embryos from Jurassic Park's cryogenic storage facilities.

On October 3, 1993, less than a year after President Clinton began his first term as President of the United States and almost eight years before Sept. 11, 2001, a small force of U.S. Army Rangers and members of the elite Delta Force were helicoptered into the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia's war-torn capital, in a daring daylight raid to capture two of Somali clan leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid's top lieutenants.  The plan was simple -- drop four &quot;chalks&quot; of Rangers to secure a perimeter around the target building (near the Olympic Hotel) while the Delta commandos -- the D-Boys, as the Rangers referred to them -- gathered the prisoners.  Then they'd be exfiltrated by a convoy of armed humvees and trucks and whisked back to the U.S. Army base in Mogadishu International Airport.<br />But, as General of the Army (and later President) Dwight Eisenhower once said, no military plan ever survives intact once the first shots are fired, so instead of a quick in-and-out raid, the 100 men of Task Force Ranger found themselves in the middle of a hostile and anarchic sector of Mogadishu known as the Bukara Market (and also as &quot;the Black Sea&quot;), engaged in what was, until the recent war in Iraq, the most sustained and deadly firefight in American military annals since Vietnam.<br />Mark Bowden, a long-time reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, chronicles the harrowing &quot;Battle of the Black Sea&quot; in his bestselling book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War with a fine eye for detail, a crisp and gripping narrative, and without bias toward either the Somalis or the Americans involved in the 18-hour firefight that left 18 American soldiers dead, over 70 wounded, and hundreds of Somali casualties.  Despite having had no prior military experience or even any expertise on defense issues, Bowden has written a non-fiction work that joins such works as Cornelius Ryan's A Bridge Too Far and Lt. Gen. Hal Moore's We Were Soldiers Once...and Young as a true classic of military history.f military history.	2004-02-22

Tales From Jabba's Palace is one of several anthologies of short stories set in George Lucas' &quot;galaxy far, far away&quot; that delve into the cast of supporting characters that were seen in specific scenes of Classic Trilogy Episodes IV, V, and VI.  Edited by prolific Star Wars author Kevin J. Anderson (Darksaber, The Jedi Academy Trilogy, and various Dark Horse comic book series), this volume contains 19 entertaining stories set within the walled palace of Tatooine crime boss Jabba the Hutt.<br />Although (curiously) none of the stories are about Jabba the Hutt per se, the slug-like gangster's presence is evident in most of the tales. Almost all the members of Jabba's court -- majordomo Bib Fortuna, Oola (the ill-fated dancing girl fed to the rancor), Salacious Crumb (Jabba's annoying pet monkey-lizard), and Boba Fett, the galaxy's most infamous bounty hunter -- are described vividly not only by such noted Star Wars writers as Dave Wolverton, Timothy Zahn, Kathy Tyers, and editor Anderson (who contributed &quot;A Boy and His Monster: The Rancor Keeper's Tale&quot;), but also by prominent Star Trek authors A. C. Crispin and Judith and Garfield Reeves Stevens.<br /> The overall tone of this anthology can be best described as a combination of Rashomon and The Godfather set in the Star Wars galaxy.  Although a few of the characters are innocent victims of Jabba's huge appetite for wealth and shady deals (see Kathy Tyers' &quot;A Time to Mourn, A Time to Dance: Oola's Tale&quot;) or antiheroes such as Mara Jade (&quot;Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade&quot; by Timothy Zahn), most are underhanded and venal mob underlings whose desire to topple Jabba from his throne is matched only by their fear of the ruthless Hutt crime lord.  And while the rescue of Han Solo by Luke Skywalker and his friends is dealt with as well, the focus isn't on the heroes for a change; after all, we saw what they did in Return of the Jedi.  No, the fun here is in discovering the untold stories from behind the fortress-like walls of Jabba's Palace, and believe me, this anthology is well-written and enjoyable for both the die-hard and casual Star Wars fan alike.tories from behind the fortress-like walls of Jabba's Palace, and believe me, this anthology is well-written and enjoyable for both the die-hard and casual Star Wars fan alike.	2004-02-20

It is a time of transition in the galaxy.  A few years after the Battle of Endor, even though the evil Empire now only controls a quarter of its vast territory and Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaign to destroy the fledgling New Republic has been defeated, the former Rebels still face many challenges -- and many foes -- as they strive to restore peace and justice to the galaxy.<br />Thrawn's campaign (chronicled in the 1991-93 trilogy by Timothy Zahn) and subsequent events not only prolonged the continuing conflict between the New Republic and the dying Empire, but they also highlighted the Republic's biggest weakness -- the absence of a strong Jedi Order to help protect its values and its citizens.  Where once there had been 10,000 Jedi Knights in the days before Palpatine's rise to power and the demise of the first Galactic Republic, only Luke Skywalker remains as a full-fledged Jedi.<br />Luke, of course, has been trying to train his twin sister Leia in the ways of the Force, but her duties as a member of the Provisional Council and her brother's recent experiences -- including a fall to the dark side and almost a repetition of their father Anakin's mistakes -- have impeded her progress as a Jedi apprentice. Leia's marriage to Han Solo and the birth of three potential Jedi children also demand her attention, so Luke must look elsewhere for Jedi apprentices.<br />Kevin J. Anderson's Jedi Search is the first of a three-book cycle that chronicles Luke Skywalker's endeavors to set up a new Jedi Academy and to restore the order of Jedi Knights.  With very few records left over after the Great Purge inflicted by the late Emperor and his own father, Darth Vader, Luke must not only scour the galaxy for data on the training of new Knights, but he also needs to find new candidates to teach.<br />Even as Luke gets approval from the New Republic to set up a Jedi academy, new challenges and old enemies arise.  On Kessel, Han Solo and Chewbacca are captured by Moruth Doole, a cunning mine official who now runs the entire spice mine complex -- and the individual that had, several years before, tipped off the Imperial tariff authorities that Solo was hauling a load of spice destined for crime boss Jabba the Hutt. The Millennium Falcon had been boarded, but not before Han had jettisoned the spice...which had saved him and Chewbacca from a stint in Imperial detention blocks but not, unfortunately, from a debt to Jabba.<br />Elsewhere, a new threat emerges as Admiral Daala, the beautiful but ruthless woman (and only female flag officer in the Imperial fleet) in command of a squadron of Star Destroyers assigned to protect a top-secret research facility, prepares to unleash a new campaign against the Rebels who killed her paramour and destroyed her beloved Empire.  With her four massive warships and several powerful super weapons at her disposal, Daala bides her time, waiting for the proper moment to start her devastating strike....<br />Anderson, a technical editor and writer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and author of other non-Star Wars novels, has become one of the most prolific authors of Star Wars Expanded Universe material.  He loves the universe created by George Lucas in his five films (even though some of the Jedi concepts here are radically different from data established in the two prequels released in 1999 and 2002) and knows the characters and situations well enough to write interesting and entertaining &quot;further adventures&quot; novels, comic book series, and short stories set &quot;a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away....&quot;nning mine official who now runs the entire spice mine complex -- and the individual that had, several years before, tipped off the Imperial tariff authorities that Solo was hauling a load of spice destined for crime boss Jabba the Hutt.

It is November 1943, and the Second World War is in its fourth year.  Adolf Hitler's Third Reich is fending off Allied advances in the Eastern Front and in Italy.  German cities are being bombed \\"around the clock\\" by the American and British air forces.  Across the English Channel, the Anglo-American forces are marshaling troops and making plans for history's greatest amphibious operation, which is tentatively scheduled for May of 1944.<br />But even though Germany has suffered great defeats in North Africa and the vast territories of the Soviet Union, Hitler still has hopes of winning the war.  Desperately seeking a significant propaganda victory and inspired by the rescue of fellow dictator Benito Mussolini by a team of German special forces, the Fuhrer (egged on by SS chief Heinrich Himmler) orders the head of Military Intelligence (Abwehr) to carry out an even more daring special forces mission: to capture British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and bring him to the Reich.<br />At first, it is an offhand remark, \\"a joke,\\" as Abwehr Col. Max Radl notes, \\"...something the Fuhrer threw out in an angry mood on a Wednesday, to be forgotten by Friday.\\"  Soon, though, as Himmler orders a feasibility study and Radl ponders it, what seems like a fantastic notion soon starts looking as something that can, with the right men and conditions, be done.<br />This dangerous mission is assigned to Lt. Col. Kurt Steiner, the son of a German general and his American wife, and a small group of paratroopers. Their mission: to drop into East Anglia near the town of Studley Constable, where Abwehr agent Joanna Grey and IRA operative Liam Devlin are waiting to assist in the capture of Britain's wartime leader, and snatch Churchill from the estate where he is staying while on an inspection tour.<br />And so, in the early morning hours of November 6, 1943, as soon as Steiner's small band of paratroopers floats down onto English soil, Heinrich Himmler receives the coded message he has been waiting for with great anticipation: \\"The Eagle has landed.\\"<br />Jack Higgins' bestselling novel was published almost 30 years ago, but its taut storyline and inventive blend of fact and fiction place this World War II thriller in the ranks of the best books of the genre.  His descriptions of historical characters -- such as Adolf Hitler -- and his references to actual historical events give the whole scenario verisimilitude.  All the characters -- hero, anti-hero, and even villains -- are well-developed and believable. Higgins also has the creative chutzpah of injecting a first-person narrator named Jack Higgins, making the book sound like a reporter's expose of a German mission so daring that it had to be covered up by the Allies.<br />The novel launched Higgins' career into almost instant fame, and in turn inspired a 1977 film version starring Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Donald Sutherland, and Joanna Miles.  It was followed in the mid-1980s by a sequel, The Eagle Has Flown.een waiting for with great anticipation: \\"The Eagle has landed.\\"<br />Jack Higgins' bestselling novel was published almost 30 years ago, but its taut storyline and inventive blend of fact and fiction place this World War II thriller in the ranks of the best books of the genre.

Every heroic saga, whether it is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or George Lucas' Star Wars series, succeeds or fails on the cunning and sheer &quot;stage presence&quot; of the antagonists faced by the heroes of the story.  Let's face it, Lord Darth Vader is more imposing, and more interesting, than Luke Skywalker, the farmboy-turned-Jedi Knight who, by the way, is also Vader's offspring. The fact that Vader was so obviously evil and menacing in the first two Episodes of the Classic Trilogy had already made him one of the most popular movie villains; the revelation that the Dark Lord had once been Anakin Skywalker made him even more interesting, and by extension, Luke also became more complex and heroic.<br />Star Wars also has a secondary set of villains that dwells in the shadowy corners under the metal and plastic surfaces of the Galactic Empire: the bounty hunters.  Every Star Wars film, including Episode I: The Phantom Menace, has a scene with at least one of these amoral, relentless, and resourceful villains, but their role as foils to the Heroes of the Rebellion came to the fore in Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.  In this perennial fan favorite, both Lord Vader and crime boss Jabba the Hutt hire a diverse group of bounty hunters in an all-hands effort to capture the Millennium Falcon, her captain Han Solo, and all his companions, including Luke Skywalker.<br />Although the film only showed this band of ruffians only in one scene that takes place aboard Vader's flagship, Star Wars: Tales of the Bounty Hunters fleshes out this particular part of the saga with five short stories compiled and edited by Kevin J. Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy).<br />Readers of Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina will recognize all five contributors, including Anderson, whose &quot;Therefore I Am: The Tale of IG-88&quot; adds depth and menace to an assassin droid seen only for a flash in the Vader's flagship scene in Episode V.  Think of this story as &quot;The Terminator Meets Star Wars,&quot; with a frighteningly self-aware droid that &quot;comes alive,&quot; overwhelms its puny human creators, and begins to devise a plan to conquer the galaxy itself.  (Readers will notice that parts of this story will not only be echoed in Kathy Tyers' &quot;The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk,&quot; but also in Dark Horse Comics' adaptation of Shadows of the Empire.&quot;)<br />Of course, &quot;The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett,&quot; by Daniel Keys Moran, features the Star Wars galaxy's most famous -- or infamous -- bounty hunter.  Although its status as an &quot;origins of&quot; story is now rather questionable, since readers now know the genesis of Boba Fett, the story is well-written and captures the nuances of its protagonist. Of the five stories in the anthology, this one covers nearly three decades of Fett's &quot;career,&quot; including the bounty hunter's long-standing and relentless pursuit of smuggler-turned-Rebel-Hero Han Solo, not only for Vader and Jabba, but for other crime lords as well. (Star Wars artists working on 2002's Episode II: Attack of the Clones may have had this and other Boba Fett &quot;origin myth&quot; stories when they decided on the design for the clone troopers; Fett supposedly had been a stormtrooper before switching over to bounty hunting; the design of the clone trooper armor was an homage to this notion.)<br />This anthology, like the others in the Tales series, is entertaining, especially for fans of the original film trilogy who want to know more about those hissable and fearsome villains...the bounty hunters.tar Wars,&quot; with a frighteningly self-aware droid that &quot;comes alive,&quot; overwhelms its puny human creators, and begins to devise a plan to conquer the galaxy itself.

Special Forces, the seventh and final entry in Tom Clancy's nonfiction Guided Tour series about America's armed forces, sets its sights on the shadowy -- and often misunderstood -- roles and missions of the men the author calls &quot;the quiet professionals&quot; of the Army's Special Forces command.<br />Although the public image of the Special Forces stems from such movies as John Wayne's 1968 cornball classic The Green Berets and the Rambo trilogy (Stallone's John Rambo is a former SF veteran who served in Vietnam) and Sgt. Barry Sadler's once-popular &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets,&quot; Clancy and his co-author John D. Gresham point out that far from being hell-for-leather, shoot-first-ask-questions-later killing machines, SF soldiers are actually among the best troops in the U.S. Army.  They have to be, because their missions -- ranging from blowing up a bridge or weapons factory far behind enemy lines to organizing, training, advising, and assisting foreign armies and police forces of &quot;host&quot; countries &quot;to protect their societies or free them from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, and terrorism.&quot;  This means that in addition to their combat roles in Afghanistan and Iraq, SF teams are among the busiest of America's soldiers.<br />One of the more interesting insights I got from reading Special Forces is related to the role played by SF deployments in El Salvador during the darkest days of that Central American nation's long-running civil war.  The Reagan Administration, knowing that any major American military intervention would be very unpopular at home and abroad (a Vietnam II in our own back yard, to put it bluntly), was caught in a decision-making dilemma.  Clearly they did not wish El Salvador to &quot;go Red&quot; as Cuba and Nicaragua had in the past, yet they knew the ruling class -- derived from the wealthy class of landowners and other top honchos -- was also very indifferent about the conditions of the Salvadoran poor, particularly those in the countryside.  Using the army and national guard -- themselves derived from El Salvador's small middle class -- in repressive and counterproductive ways, El Salvador's government just made matters worse, using indiscriminate tactics and the infamous death squads. Surely, Washington couldn't be too closely linked to a small group of wealthy &quot;patrones&quot; whose only interest was to maintain their lock on power and to ignore the people's legitimate demands for justice and social reform.<br />The solution? To use Special Forces to gradually change the mindset of the Salvadoran army.  It took time, and quite a few of the SF advisers lost their lives in the crossfire between leftist forces and the army.  Nevertheless, the Salvadoran officers and soldiers were &quot;re-educated&quot; and, as Clancy writes, &quot;the Salvadoran Army tried acting in other than brutal and repressive ways toward their fellow countrymen, they began to halt activities of their death squads and to actually show respect for basic human rights.<br />As a result, the rebels lost a lot of support, the Army started winning hearts, minds, and territory, and &quot;by the end of the Cold War [a] peace treaty was a done deal, the civil war had ended, and today there is a coalition government....&quot; Granted, the SF deployments alone were not responsible for this achievement, but they had a major effect in getting the Salvadoran people to see that the way things were being handled by both the government and the rebels were just leading to more bloodshed and chaos.<br />As in all the Guided Tour series, which are being updated to reflect changes in technology, doctrine, and world realities, Special Forces gives the general reading audience a look at the equipment, training, organization, and the soldiers themselves.  There is an interview with Gen. Henry H. Shelton USA (Ret) former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an experienced Special Operations veteran who served withthe Special Forces and also commanded Special Operations Command from 1996 to 1998.  There are also overviews of the larger Special Operations Command and, finally, a short fictional account of SF personnel in action.<br />(Oh, and while the Special Forces troops are proud of their famous headgear, they really don't like to be called &quot;Green Berets.&quot; As one of them told the authors, &quot;We are NOT hats!&quot;)the Special Forces and also commanded Special Operations Command from 1996 to 1998.

We must be careful.&quot;<br />Of all the many eye-catching and memorable sequences in Star Wars (aka Episode IV: A New Hope), the fateful meeting between Luke Skywalker, Ben Kenobi, and a pair of smugglers with a starship for hire is perhaps the most intriguing.  It's not only important dramatically or even as far as the change in the film's pacing goes (from this point on, there will be chases, shootouts, rescues, and battles), it's also visually intriguing.  The dim lighting, the tense atmosphere, all those aliens, and, of course, that funky cantina band playing Benny Goodman-like tunes.<br />Of course, in the film, the focus was on Kenobi, Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca as they negotiated a charter flight to Alderaan.  But there were others in the cantina that day on Tatooine...many other minor players and eyewitnesses on that fateful day. Who were they?  What about their stories? What were some of them doing in Chalmun the Wookiee's Mos Eisley speakeasy?<br />Star Wars: Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina, edited by novelist Kevin J. Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy), is a collection of 16 original short stories set during and after the events depicted in Star Wars: A New Hope.  Within such stories as Kathy Tyers &quot;We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale&quot; there are little tidbits of heretofore unknown data that add depth and nuance to the scene in the film. Want to know the name of the cantina band? (It's Figrin Da'n and the Modal Nodes). What are those two women who look like twins doing in the cantina? (I'm not giving any more free info away here...read Timothy Zahn's &quot;Hammertong&quot; to find out.)  All 16 stories are well-written and move almost as fast as the Millennium Falcon, and they all seem to fit into the Star Wars storyline without feeling, well, forced.<br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this anthology was discovering that authors better known for writing about the Star Trek universe also moonlight in the Star Wars Galaxy.  A.C.

Even though George Lucas' six-film Star Wars saga focuses intensely on a relatively small group of characters (the Skywalker family and the various Jedi and Sith Lords that tied their personal destiny to that of the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire), its setting (&quot;a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away....&quot;) was, and still is, a very huge canvas onto which many other stories can be easily included. Many fans, either by playing with their action figures as children or by writing fan fiction, created their own personal additions to the Star Wars universe and, at least in their own imagination, took part in the noble struggle between good and evil that's one of the building blocks of this modern day mythology.<br />Eventually, as Peter Schweighofer, editor of Tales From the Empire, writes in his introduction to this 1997 anthology of short stories, the action figures were put away and the fan fiction stories stashed away in drawers or file cabinets, but the fans' appetite for new Star Wars stories -- on film and on the printed page -- never really went away.  And with the 1991 publication of Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, the fans received a cornucopia of &quot;further adventures&quot; featuring not only the beloved heroes from the movies but a whole new cast of allies and adversaries.<br />Tales From the Empire is a collection of nine short stories that first appeared in West End Games' Star Wars Adventure Journal, plus a short novel (Side Trip) co-written by two of the best writers of Star Wars fiction, Timothy Zahn and Michael A. Stackpole.  Most of these brief excursions into Lucas' galaxy are set during the time of the Galactic Civil War and/or the first few years of the post-Endor New Republic era, with entirely original characters -- Darth Vader makes a cameo in the Zahn/Stackpole novel and events that took place in the films (the Death Star's destruction at Yavin) are mentioned in passing -- that inhabit the millions of star systems in the strife-torn vastness of space.<br />Although the stories by Kathy Tyers (The Truce at Bakura), Stackpole (the X-Wing series creator), and Zahn are as well-written as their published Star Wars novels, credit must also be given to lesser known writers as Tony Russo, Laurie Burns, and Angela Phillips, whose tale of a young hacker (&quot;slicer&quot; in Star Wars terminology) who joins the Rebellion in the face of her parents' opposition (&quot;Slaying Dragons&quot;) is among the best pieces of short fiction I have read in a while.strife-torn vastness of space.<br />Although the stories by Kathy Tyers (The Truce at Bakura), Stackpole (the X-Wing series creator), and Zahn are as well-written as their published Star Wars novels, credit must also be given to lesser known writers as Tony Russo, Laurie Burns, and Angela Phillips, whose tale of a young hacker (&quot;slicer&quot; in Star Wars terminology) who joins the Rebellion in the face of her parents' opposition (&quot;Slaying Dragons&quot;) is among the best pieces of short fiction I have read in a while.	2004-02-10

In Trial by Fire, Harold Coyle's fourth novel (and third in the Scott Dixon series), the United States Army shifts its focus from the recently ended Gulf War and the demise of the Warsaw Pact and onto battlefields and opponents -- this time much closer to home, across the Rio Grande in Mexico.<br />Set in the early 1990s (most works of fiction often reflect the times in which they are created) a short time after the abortive Moscow putsch, Trial by Fire begins with a deadly and successful coup d'etat in Mexico as the military, fed up with the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) party's corrupt and inept ways, does away with the President and most of the PRI leadership.  Motivated -- mostly -- by patriotism, genuine concern for Mexico's countless millions of poor inhabitants, and a desire to kick the country into the approaching 21st Century, the new Council of 13 moves quickly to sweep aside political opposition and the powerful criminal organizations that practically run some of the country's states.<br />But when Col. Alfredo Guajardo, one of the members of the new military junta, sets his sights on Hector Alaman, aka \\"El Dueno\\" (The Manager), a notorious drug baron whose empire has spread across the entire Caribbean, the New Revolution that he has helped to successfully bring about will be jeopardized by the aftershocks of a daring military raid on Alaman's fortified villa/compound at Chinampas.  While the Mexican army's heliborne assault is a nominal success and the huge estate is captured, Alaman himself escapes along with a handful of experienced, ruthless and highly paid mercenaries.<br />Alaman's escape from the raid at Chinampas will soon prove to be more than an embarrasing incident that can be dismissed by the new rulers of Mexico.  Alaman's thirst for revenge has no limits, and together with his little but efficient army of foreign mercenaries, including an American named Childress and Lefleur, a particularly creative Frenchman who will carry out any act of violence as long as his pockets are lined with dollars, the drug lord strikes back.  Knowing full well that they alone can't topple the Army and the Council of 13, Alaman and his goons create a series of border incidents to create a Second Mexican-American War.<br />Coyle, who is one of the best writers of the military fiction genre, once again places Lt. Col. Scott Dixon, veteran of two previous conflicts (chronicled in Sword Point and Bright Star) and Medal of Honor recipient, at the tip of the spear of America's response to the apparent new enemy south of the border.  Serving with Dixon once again is Capt. Harold (Hal) Cerro, former airborne officer and veteran of the Iran and Libyan campaigns, and now assigned to the 16th Armored Division, where he will be serving for the first time as a staff officer rather than commanding a company in the field.<br />Coyle also brings back such memorable characters as Jan Fields, the brash, beautiful, intelligent and dogged reporter who is Col. Dixon's current lover, and whose reporter's instincts and desire to get the story land her in jeopardy and Congressman Ed Lewis, a forner National Guard officer who wants to know the truth about why American troops are being sent into combat in Mexico.<br />Trial by Fire also introduces a vibrant new character in 2nd Lt. Nancy Kozak, one of the first female officers to be assigned to the Infantry branch as a platoon commander.  Coyle does a terrific job in describing Kozak's determination to be \\"all that she can be\\" in a profession that was once considered a males-only \\"brotherhood of war.\\"  His portrait of her drive to be a good infantry officer while still being female is a fine example of storytelling at its best, and his knowledge of the military, its equipment, and more importantly, its people and culture, allows Coyle to show the men and women in uniform as believable human beings with real emotions.  His novels are somehow smaller in scope than his mentor Tom Clancy's huge technothrillers, but Coyle's depictions of his cast of characters are more appealing.ancy's huge technothrillers, but Coyle's depictions of his cast of characters are more appealing.	2004-02-08

Very few place names in the U.S. evoke still-vivid memories of shocking violence, death, destruction, and a sense that America and her place in the world would never be the same afterwards.  In our lifetimes, perhaps only Dallas, Manhattan and Washington, D.C. will rival Pearl Harbor as an existing location where memories of cataclysmic events will overshadow the present.  For just as the Pentagon has been repaired and the World Trade Center will be rebuilt after the events of Sept. 11, 2001, Pearl Harbor is still a bustling -- if somewhat quieter -- naval base in the Pacific.  Yet, say the name and you'll conjure up newsreel footage of the USS Arizona exploding and Japanese bombers attacking Battleship Row on what had previously been a quiet Sunday morning.<br />Walter Lord, author of such acclaimed narratives as A Night to Remember, A Time to Stand, and Incredible Victory, tells very human stories of heroism and sacrifice as he recounts the events of December 7, 1941 from both American and Japanese perspectives.  His clear and descriptive narrative, his masterful use of interviews with survivors and material from the vast amount of historical records, and his decision to focus the book's focus on the events of the evening of Dec. 6 and the &quot;day of infamy&quot; itself make this a fine literary starting point for readers who want to learn the Pearl Harbor story without having to wade through books that deal with all the preliminaries (such as At Dawn We Slept) or try to revise history (John Toland's Infamy) to pin the blame on President Roosevelt.<br />All in all, for a book that was first published in the late 1950s, Day of Infamy is still considered one of the best popular histories about a World War II event, and I strongly recommend it.orld War II event, and I strongly recommend it.	2004-02-07

After all, where would James T. Kirk be without the USS Enterprise, or Kathryn Janeway without the USS Voyager?  For many Star Trek fans, it's the starship that is the true star of the series, with Kirk (or Picard, or Janeway, or Archer) and Co. as the human &quot;supporting cast&quot; that represents the dreamers who want to &quot;boldly go where no one has gone before.&quot;<br />Although dedicated fans and role-playing game designers had written, illustrated, and even published unofficial Technical Journals of Star Trek's primary starships, Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda's Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual was the first really detailed &quot;owner's manual&quot; to the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) &quot;done by folks who actually work on Star Trek.&quot;  Published in October 1991 (halfway through The Next Generation's seven-year run) and featuring Gene Roddenberry's last published words in his special introduction, the Technical Manual is the first volume of a trio of &quot;official&quot; Star Trek references that include The Star Trek Chronology: A History of the Future and The Star Trek Encyclopedia.<br />The Technical Manual's conceit is that it is a 24th Century reference work, perhaps as a Starfleet public relations publication or in-house orientation manual.  The tone the authors adopt (with the exception of the &quot;out-of-the-Star-Trek-scenario footnotes, which are insightful and often humorous) is very similar to a NASA shuttle operator's guide, matter-of-fact, dry, and -- of course -- like a technical journal.

On December 16, 1944, elements of four German armies -- 14 infantry and five panzer divisions in all -- attacked part of the American First Army along an 80-mile front along Germany's border with Belgium and Luxembourg.  The sudden and unexpected counteroffensive hit the Americans in an area the Allies thought would be a nice, quiet sector for combat-weary divisions to rest and refit while green divisions fresh from the States could be acclimated to life on the line: the dark and deep forests of the Ardennes.  Planned and ordered by Adolf Hitler himself, this massive onslaught was launched with one objective in mind: penetrate the American lines, pass through the \\"impassable\\" Ardennes Forest, cross the Meuse River, and capture the vital port of Antwerp.  At the very least, the Allied supply situation would deteriorate enough to slow the Anglo-American advance to the Reich's industrial heartland by a matter of months and buy time for Hitler and his tottering empire.  At the very best, a German victory would split the Grand Alliance in three, trap the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group on the northern sector of the front, and the Fuhrer could attempt to convince the Soviets that further fighting was useless now that the Western Allies had been defeated at the Reich's very doorstep.<br />For a few snowy, foggy, and bitterly cold days, things seemed to be going Hitler's way.  Caught off-guard by the sheer size of the counteroffensive, hampered by bad weather which prevented Allied air power to provide ground support to the tankers and infantrymen along the front, confused and misdirected by a small number of English-speaking German commandos wearing American uniforms, and, at some points along the 80-mile \\"Ghost Front,\\" isolated, outnumbered, and forced to surrender, GIs fought a seemingly losing battle against hundreds of thousands of German soldiers.  But even when some units panicked or were overrun, many American soldiers -- sometimes in dribs and drabs -- stood fast and delayed the enemy, giving Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Allied Supreme Commander, and his generals valuable time to plan a riposte and turn what seemed to be a disaster into a strategic opportunity.  And sure enough, after a month's of heavy fighting in the awful cold of a European winter, the German counteroffensive was slowed, halted, and gradually pushed back to where it had started.<br />The late Charles B. MacDonald, one of America's premier military historians and himself a company commander in the Ardennes campaign, captures the chaos, misery, bravery, and drama of the U.S. Army's largest battle in history in A Time For Trumpets: The Untold Story of the Battle of the Bulge.  The author of such acclaimed works as Company Commander and The Mighty Endeavor, MacDonald uses his skills as a writer and his knowledge of the infantryman's combat experiences to paint a vivid picture of Hitler's last gamble to gain even a temporary victory in the West and the efforts of over 600,000 U.S. and several thousand British troops to contain the salient or \\"bulge\\" that gave the Ardennes counteroffensive its popular moniker.<br />A Time for Trumpets not only covers the well-known episodes of the small teams of German soldiers wearing American uniforms (they actually did very little material damage, but their very existence caused jumpy GI's to quiz each other about baseball teams, state capitals, even popular singers and bandleaders), the heroic stand of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne and the infamous Malmedy massacre, but delves into the Allies' biggest intelligence failure of the war and the bitter recrimination between British and American commanders when Eisenhower placed the northern half of the \\"bulge\\" under the command of Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery.  Attention to detail is also given to the German high command's reluctance to execute Hitler's plan by the letter, knowing in their professional soldiers' hearts and minds that the Nazi dictator was overreaching.<br />Despite the complexity of the battle, A Time For Trumpets is highly readable and engrossing.  There are helpful maps and many pages of photos to help the casual reader keep his or her bearings in this sprawling month-long battle, and the various appendices are valuable tools that illustrate the composition of a standard U.S. infantry regiment and the various Orders of Battle for the Allied and German forces engaged in the Battle of the Bulge.Despite the complexity of the battle, A Time For Trumpets is highly readable and engrossing.

US	43389853	RLGI78538NTZN	0345435419	595671727	Star Wars: Darth Maul, Shadow Hunter (Star Wars - Legends)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Star Wars goes &quot;noir&quot; in gripping &quot;pre-prequel&quot;......	One of the things I find interesting about the Star Wars prequels is the notion that although most fans know the eventual outcome -- Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is going to declare himself Emperor, Anakin Skywalker will succumb to the Dark Side, and a climactic duel with his friend and mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi will leave Skywalker terribly scarred and transform him into Darth Vader -- the movies (flaws and all) give us the details of the story.  To those few fans -- if the reviews of Episodes I and II on this site are a reflection of how many people do like the new movies by George Lucas -- who enjoy The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, the revelations about the decline and fall of the Galactic Republic, the roles, missions, and lifestyles of the Jedi Order, and the tragic transformation of a well-intentioned but vulnerable Jedi into the galaxy's most menacing villain are intriguing.<br />Because the prequels cover a much longer span of time than the Classic Trilogy and focus mostly on Anakin, his stormy apprenticeship with Obi-Wan, and his forbidden romance with Padme Amidala -- with Palpatine's rise to power as the backdrop -- there are always &quot;untold stories&quot; about the mysterious Sith and the soon-to-be-vanquished Jedi Order.  A few details are divulged in the films, such as the Sith being limited to two members -- &quot;a master, and an apprentice.&quot;  But inevitably running time and other considerations preclude more detailed explanations about Darth Sidious (Palpatine's Sith alter ego) and his sly machinations to defeat the Jedi and take over the decaying Galactic Republic.<br />Some novelists -- Alan Dean Foster, James Luceno, Greg Bear, and Michael Reeves -- have written an Expanded Universe series of novels that seek to fill in some of the blanks about the prequel era.  Bear and Foster, for instance, chronicle some of the events in the decade between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in Rogue Planet and The Approaching Storm. Luceno and Reeves' novels, on the other hand, are &quot;pre-prequels&quot; set shortly before the events depicted in Episode I.<br />Whereas Luceno's Star Wars: Cloak of Deception focuses on the political machinations of Palpatine and sets up the downfall of Supreme Chancellor Valorum, Reeve's Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter is a Star Wars film noir-styled mystery set shortly before The Phantom Menace.  Darth Sidious and his greedy but none-too-brave Neimoidian allies are planning to blockade the small planet of Naboo to express the Trade Federation's objection to the taxation of trade routes.  Everything is going according to plan: the Federation's fleet is preparing to head to the Outer Rim and the Naboo system, the battle droids are hidden in the doughnut-shaped starships' holds, and Sidious' sly maneuvers have thrown the Galactic Senate into a political maelstrom.<br />But when one of the four Neimoidian conspirators, Hath Monchar, reverts to his species' cowardly nature and flees to the city world of Coruscant, Sidious realizes that he must take decisive steps to prevent the Republic from discovering the Naboo scheme prematurely.  Fortunately, he has a powerful asset: Darth Maul, his young, well trained, and formidable apprentice. The horned and tattooed Dark Lord and his double-bladed lightsaber should not have too much trouble finding one scared and desperate Neimoidian, even one hidden among Coruscant's teeming billions.<br />Reeves, of course, can't change the Star Wars galaxy's destiny and having Maul fail in his mission. He -- and the audience -- knows that the rise of the Sith and the Empire is set in celluloid and print, yet somehow he manages to write a suspenseful tale pitting the relentless Maul (who really got very little screen time in a movie that was heavily promoted with his likeness) against a strange alliance between the cynical rogue Lorn Pavan, a ne'er do well former employee of the Jedi Temple who lives in the fringes of Coruscant society, and Darsha Assant, a young Jedi Padawan on her first mission without her Master's direct supervision.  Thrown together by circumstance and pursued by the relentless Darth Maul, these two characters -- and Lorn's sarcastic droid companion I-Five -- prove to be an unexpected challenge to the Jedi-hating Sith Lord.<br />Reeves' style and tone are similar to Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer stories, albeit set in George Lucas' &quot;galaxy far, far away.&quot;  The characters are vividly described and are, for a space/fantasy genre novel, engaging and even believable.  And even though -- like its film source -- the ending is not a surprise, Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter is a fast-paced and entertaining read.ha Assant, a young Jedi Padawan on her first mission without her Master's direct supervision.

The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a blessing in disguise not only for the Pentagon but for writers of military fiction.  Just as the armed services have had to develop new doctrines, strategies, tactics, and weapons systems to contend with new enemies (potential and real), authors such as Tom Clancy, Stephen Coonts, Harold Coyle, and Larry Bond have had to look at the world situation, read the proverbial &quot;tea leaves,&quot; and write plausible scenarios pitting American soldiers against foes that are very different from the by-now all-too-familiar Soviet &quot;Ivan.&quot;<br />The writing team of Bond and Patrick Larkin (Red Phoenix, Vortex) was one of the earliest practitioners of &quot;the-Cold-War-is-ending, let's-look-at-other-story-possibilities&quot; idea.  Although the Soviet Union was still in existence when their first two novels were published in the early 1990s, its role in Red Phoenix (about a second Korean War) and Vortex (conflict breaks out in South Africa) is very limited...think of it as an old Mafia don giving limited amounts of money and guns to a younger up-and-coming capo.<br />In Cauldron, the international situation is very different.  NATO has dissolved, its mission as Western Europe's shield against a massive Soviet invasion having been achieved.  France and Germany have formed a loose military alliance, and right-wing elements now begin reviving the old empire building instincts most Europeans thought had died out with the end of the Second World War.  But the wars in the Balkans and greed in the hearts of many government officials in France and Germany -- and even impoverished Russia -- have awakened the old demons of imperial ambitions and diplomatic arrogance.  And when the new Franco-German alliance starts bullying the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe for financial gain, Hungary and Poland soon become the first victims of full-scale aggression.  Only the United States and Great Britain, aided by a few other smaller European allies, stand in the way of a Third World War.<br />Long time readers of the genre -- and of the Bond/Larkin novels in particular -- know that the eventual outcome is never really in doubt.  The techno-thriller, in some ways, is sometimes just as predictable and conventional as a Harlequin Romance novel....only instead of ripped bodices and heaving bosoms there are camouflaged fatigues and flying missiles.  Still, the premise of American and British troops facing off against former allies is (while far-fetched) intriguing and a bit disconcerting.aided by a few other smaller European allies, stand in the way of a Third World War.<br />Long time readers of the genre -- and of the Bond/Larkin novels in particular -- know that the eventual outcome is never really in doubt.

Carrier, the sixth book in Tom Clancy's Guided Tour non-fiction series about America's armed forces, is a detailed look at the Navy's grande dame, the aircraft carrier and associated battle group (CVBG).  Even 63 years after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor ended the reign of the big-gun battleship and despite the lethality of nuclear attack submarines, the carrier, with its 70+ plane air wing and assorted escorts, is still the most powerful, versatile, and visible symbol of American sea power.<br />Once again, Clancy and series collaborator John D. Gresham take the reader where no ordinary civilian can easily go.  From the Pentagon office of Admiral Jay Johnson (who at the time was Chief of Naval Operations) to the bustling -- and dangerous -- flight deck of the Nimitz-class USS Harry S Truman, the authors explain the role of the modern carrier group in today's world, as well as describing each ship -- from carrier to guided missile escorts -- and aircraft that makes the CVBG the &quot;big stick&quot; of American foreign policy.<br />At the time of publication (2000), the Navy was still in the midst of the transition from large 90 aircraft carrier air wings (CAW), and strike pilots were completing the handover of air-to-ground attack missions from the venerable A-6 Intruder to the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet.  Other changes discussed by Clancy and Gresham are the eventual phasing out of the F-14 Tomcat, the long-range interceptor made famous by Tom Cruise's 1986 mega-hit Top Gun. Although still a formidable aircraft, the Tomcat -- which has never fired its prime long range missile, the Phoenix, in combat -- is now a 32-year-old design and due to be replaced by late generation F/A-18 Hornet variants and the new Joint Strike Fighter now in development.<br />As in all the Guided Tour books, there are chapters devoted to all the elements that make a CVBG such a valuable fleet asset.  Much of the book focuses on the Nimitz-class carrier's design, construction, power plant (or at least as much as the Navy will allow the authors to divulge for security reasons), and the embarked air wing.  However, Clancy emphasizes the human element and describes the training and daily lives of the sailors and airmen that operate the various ships and aircraft of the CVBG.<br />Clancy also continues the tradition of ending his Guided Tour books with a short but entertaining fictional account of a unit in action.  In this case, the author looks forward at the world in 2016, pitting the United States in a short but fierce confrontation with India after &quot;the world's largest democracy&quot; has a nuclear exchange with its Muslim neighbor Pakistan and becomes erratic in its foreign policy.<br />Although Clancy is hardly objective when writing about the military -- he clearly loves the services -- he does provide the public valuable insights into what the Navy does and the tasks our men and women in uniform perform daily in times of war and peace.  Carrier, therefore, is an informative and entertaining primer on today's Navy...and tells the reader exactly why every President since World War II has asked, in times of crisis, &quot;where are the carriers?&quot;ant (or at least as much as the Navy will allow the authors to divulge for security reasons), and the embarked air wing.

I was still in high school and I happened to be in the K section of South Miami High's library when I came across this big hardcover of King's second novel.  A few years before, ABC had run a two-part miniseries based on this modern-day vampire novel, but I'd skipped it, thinking it was a rather unappealing program to watch.  But I'd just read Carrie and I decided to give the novel a chance. I checked the book out and started reading it on the way home via school bus.<br />It took me two weeks to get through Salem's Lot because I was then dealing not only with the normal loads of homework and reading up for exams, but I was also writing for the school paper. Nevertheless, I really was hooked by this clever juxtaposition of Bram Stroker's Dracula's plot and observations of modern American small town life.  I have lived in big cities all my life and my only experiences of small town life have been brief visits to Sebring, FL and Douglas, GA (in addition to knowing a few people who live in rural America), so for me the idea of living in a community where everyone knows everybody else...and where if you make a bad life choice (steal, cheat on your spouse, beat up same) it doesn't remain secret for long...is truly more frightening than crime in the big city.<br />Jerusalem's Lot, like Castle Rock and Derry, ME, is purely fictional, but King's keen eye for detail and his lively writing style make it seem very real.  Although some of the story elements he uses here later become standard issue (writer as hero, small Maine town and its inhabitants vs. supernatural THINGS), Salem's Lot's town and the people who live there -- Tony Glick, Ben Mears, Father Callahan, Susan, the local girl Mears falls in love with, and Mark, the young boy who must help the writer/vampire killer in his grisly task -- all come across as a real town with living, breathing beings whose lives are upended when the unspeakable horror of a vampire takeover begins.<br />King fans -- including me -- consider The Stand to be his masterpiece of horror, but this more tightly paced and shorter work is clearly among his very best.  It's a powerful chiller, and even though we know vampires are creatures of the imagination, this novel will make the first-time reader double-check to see if all the windows are closed and the door locked.rror of a vampire takeover begins.<br />King fans -- including me -- consider The Stand to be his masterpiece of horror, but this more tightly paced and shorter work is clearly among his very best.

Into the Storm, written by bestselling author Tom Clancy and retired Army general Fred Franks, is the first book of a continuing series of non-fiction military history/memoirs highlighting modern-day commanders and their experiences in war and peace.<br />Subtitled &quot;On the Ground in Iraq,&quot; Into the Storm examines the post-Vietnam War rebuilding of the United States Army from a demoralized mix of draftees and &quot;lifers&quot; to the smaller but professional fighting force that defeated Saddam Hussein's vaunted Iraqi legions in Kuwait during Gulf War I.  Clancy and Gen. Franks examine the evolution of the Army's weapons and tactics from the mid-1960s to the 1990s and the change of focus from Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union to the face-off with new enemies in distant battlefields far from the Central European plains.<br />The book is also Frank's personal account of his service as an Army officer, starting as a young cavalry lieutenant stationed in the Fulda Gap in the early 1960s, his tour of duty in Southeast Asia -- where Franks lost a leg during the May 1970 invasion of Cambodia -- and his subsequent rise to general's stars and the command of the &quot;heavy&quot; VII Corps which was Desert Storm's armored &quot;fist&quot; during the now-famous 100-Hour ground war.<br />Along the way, we learn about Fred Franks the man, a bright, intelligent and quiet man who loves his wife and family, yet is determined to stay as a serving officer despite the loss of his leg.  He comes across as a gentleman-warrior and genuine hero, yet he seems to be in awe of the young soldiers who fought and died under his command in two wars.<br />The book's narrative switches from Clancy's third-person analysis to Frank's first-person autobiographical account several times, which gives readers the best of both worlds.

US	43389853	R2353GTS92UM1D	0399107770	410060341	Summer of '42	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Gifted writer tells a classic love story in Summer of '42	Hit movies -- Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, any of the Star Trek feature films -- are usually adapted into novels, ending up in book shelves and earning additional revenue for the studios that released the film.  Often (depending on the writer who does the adaptation from screenplay to novel) the resulting book not only sells well, but takes on a life of its own as a beloved work of fiction.<br />Herman Raucher's adaptation of his screenplay for Robert Mulligan's Summer of '42 is one of those wonderful tie-ins that I, as a reader, hold close to my heart.  While Raucher's autobiographical account of Hermie, Oscy, Benjie and, of course, Dorothy is very different in genre from my usual fare of military history non-fiction, Tom Clancy technothrillers, Star Wars-related novels and reference books and things of that nature, the novel does appeal to my sentimental side.<br />And how can it not?  Yes, much of the material is taken from the screenplay, and even though Raucher uses third-person narration instead of the movie's first-person voiceovers, it is still full of laughter-inducing memories of the \\"Terrible Trio\\" and the description of the three boys' struggles against boredom on Packett Island and their growing interest in sex and women.  Mainly, though, the heart of the story is, as in the film, the brief and bittersweet romance between 15-year-old Hermie and 22-year-old Dorothy, the very lovely and very married woman he adores from afar.<br />Raucher is a gifted writer and uses a gentle sense of humor and a fine eye for detail that raises this novelization to a higher level than the usual tie-in. His tone alternates between twinkly-eyed and wry observations about Hermie and his friends to the more introspective and bittersweet recollections of Dorothy.<br />\\"The house? The house was her house. And nothing, from the first moment Hermie saw her, and no one who had ever happened to him since had ever been as frightening and as confusing or could have done more to make him feel more sure, more insecure, more important, and less significant.\\"<br />Although there is a bit of additional material to bookend the movie's events and \\"That Old Feeling\\" stands in for Michel Legrand's \\"The Summer Knows,\\" fans of the original film will not be disappointed by the book, and first-time readers who have not seen Mulligan's 1971 classic will probably want to watch it after reading this superb novel.o make him feel more sure, more insecure, more important, and less significant.\\"<br />Although there is a bit of additional material to bookend the movie's events and \\"That Old Feeling\\" stands in for Michel Legrand's \\"The Summer Knows,\\" fans of the original film will not be disappointed by the book, and first-time readers who have not seen Mulligan's 1971 classic will probably want to watch it after reading this superb novel.	2003-12-31

Military history comes in various flavors, just like ice cream.  On one side of the spectrum, you can find books that analyze the wider strategic and tactical aspects of a conflict, with emphasis on politics and the commanders on both sides.  On the other, you find books that not only deal with the \\"big picture\\" but also strive to show the conflict from the combatants' vantage point.<br />Desert Victory is one of those \\"big picture\\" books that focuses more on the strategies and tactics used by both Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and President George H.W. Bush and their respective military commanders.  Written shortly after the war (it was published in the fall of 1991) by noted historian and military analyst Norman Friedman, Desert Victory traces the roots of the first Persian Gulf War to Saddam's rise to power in the late 1970s, his disastrous foray into Iran in 1980, the misguided policies of moderate Arab countries and two U.S. administrations to support Iraq (a mostly Shi'a Muslim country ruled by a Sunni Arab minority) against the perceived threat from Shiite Iran and the genesis of Saddam's invasion of the tiny but oil-rich emirate on his southern border.<br />Friedman explains the events of the Persian Gulf War ably and intelligently, analyzing the tactics, strategies and forces employed by both sides. It is a well-researched account of both Operations Desert Shield (the buildup) and Desert Storm, with particular attention being paid to the diplomatic and military forging of the coalition that would liberate Kuwait in February of 1991.<br />However, readers who prefer the \\"Cornelius Ryan/Stephen Ambrose\\" approach are going to be disappointed. There are few eyewitness anecdotes in the text, and the prose does tend to be rather dry.	2003-12-19

Three months had passed since Iraq had invaded its tiny but rich neighbor, claiming the Kuwaitis were slant-drilling into Iraqi oil fields just across the border.<br />In reality, as Rick Atkinson points out in Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War, Saddam was strong-arming his way out of repaying loans made to Iraq by Kuwait and other moderate Arab countries during his disastrous war with Iran. He may have also been angered by OPEC's lowering of the price of crude oil, which reduced badly-needed hard currency for his moribund economy.  In a classic case of what novelist Tom Clancy calls \\"armed robbery writ large,\\" Saddam followed Hitler's example of trumping up claims on a neighboring country, massing a huge army on its borders, then invading.<br />While Atkinson (The Thin Gray Line, An Army At Dawn) focuses on the events of the war itself, he carefully explains the almost Byzantine turns of American foreign policy toward Iraq.  In the mid-1980s, Washington, worried that Iran would defeat Iraq, provided Baghdad with limited intelligence assistance and looked the other way when other countries (such as France, Brazil, and the USSR) sold Saddam sophisticated weapons. Only after the 1987 USS Stark incident, when an Iraqi Mirage \\"accidentally\\" fired an Exocet missile at a U.S. frigate in the Gulf and killed and injured several sailors, did U.S. policymakers start looking at Saddam as a potential adversary.  But until 1990, official policy in Washington was to try to coax Baghdad into joining the fold of civilized nations in the so-called post-Cold War \\"new order.\\"<br /> In fact, as Atkinson points out, Washington's desire to establish better trade and diplomatic relations may have given Saddam the \\"green light\\" to invade Kuwait.  The White House, for instance, censured the Voice of America for airing reports about Iraq's repressive government, and Ambassador April Glaspie's comment in July 1990 that the U.S. had no intentions to intervene in \\"Arab-Arab\\" disputes further reinforced the Iraqi dictator's view that America was a post-Vietnam \\"paper tiger\\" and would not lift a finger to help the Sheik of Kuwait.<br />Crusade is intensely fascinating and detailed.  It is incredibly well-written, enabling the reader to get both the Big Picture and see the war through the combatants' point of view.  It's no exaggeration to say that it reads like a Clancy novel; we get not only personality sketches of H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the \\"CINC\\" of Central Command and overall commander of Desert Storm and his chief lieutenants (Charles Horner, \\"Buster\\" Glosson, Cal Waller, Fred Franks), but we also get vivid descriptions of the intense aerial and ground battles that became known as Operation Desert Storm.<br />Atkinson also deals with the unexpected aftermath of the Persian Gulf War -- the short period of national high-fiving after the liberation of Kuwait that gave way to disillusion.  In a matter of months, President George Herbert Walker Bush went from being a popular wartime leader to being booted out of the Oval Office in the 1992 election. Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, crushed not one but two post-war revolts (encouraged but not supported by President Bush) and withstood nearly 12 years of sanctions and sporadic air and missile attacks as he defiantly thumbed his nose at three American Presidents.

Gresham's Airborne: A Guided Tour of an Airborne Task Force is the fifth entry in Berkley's &quot;Guided Tour&quot; series of non-fiction books about U.S. military units.  As one might expects, the book zeroes in on the elite paratroopers of the &quot;All-American&quot; 82nd Airborne Division, their &quot;tools of the trade,&quot; training, history and roles and missions.<br />The 82nd Airborne is America's last true paratrooper division; its XVIII Airborne Corps partner, the 101st Air Assault Division (&quot;The Screaming Eagles&quot;) traded in its parachutes for helicopters long ago.  Along with the 101st, the 82nd Airborne is teamed with the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division and the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, giving the XVIII Airborne Corps both a powerful punch and flexibility.<br />Clancy and Gresham describe practically every weapon, tool, uniform and aircraft employed in modern airborne warfare today in a clear and concise fashion.  The authors also discuss the proud history of the 82nd Airborne (and airborne warfare in general) from World War II to Operation Restore Democracy (the 1994 mission to remove the military junta in Haiti) and the various aspects of life for the modern-day paratrooper, particularly the arduous training regimen involved in getting young men and women to jump out of, as Clancy wryly observes, &quot;perfectly good airplanes.&quot;<br />Airborne also includes an interview with the then-incoming commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps, Gen. John B. Keane and a Foreword by retired Gen. Gary Luck, who commanded the corps during the first Persian Gulf War in 1991.<br />As in all the books of the Guided Tour series, Clancy includes several short vignettes to illustrate what the 82nd Airborne's roles and missions are.  Of course, now that we are in a major conflict in Iraq (in which the 82nd and 101st Divisions are engaged) Clancy's choices for settings (Sudan and Belize) seem odd, but they make for good reading and explain how the XVIII Airborne Corps is used in combat situations.plain how the XVIII Airborne Corps is used in combat situations.	2003-12-14
US	43389853	R3V80VJ11UD9BL	0517219018	825352881	The Stand (Modern Classics)	Books	5	172	187	N	N	Classic King novel as the author intended it to be read....	The Stand, Stephen King's apocalyptic novel that mixes science fiction with horror (think of it as a realistic merging of The Andromeda Strain and The Final Conflict), was a runaway best-seller when it first hit bookstores in the late 1970s and is still regarded as one of King's best works, at least by his millions of fans.  Its scenario of an accidental outbreak of a government-created strain of the flu -- which has a mortality rate of over 90 percent -- that wipes out most of mankind and sets the stage for a final showdown between good and evil makes for compelling reading.<br />What many readers did not know was that King was asked by the accounting department of his publisher to trim his already huge novel  by several hundred pages to keep costs down and to make the hardcover's price affordable ($12.95 in 1978).  Given the choice of doing the edits himself or letting the in-house editors do the cutting, King chose the former.  As a result, most -- but not all -- the characters and situations appeared reasonably whole,  although King remarks in the Preface that pyromaniac Trashcan Man's westward trek from the Midwest to Nevada has the most scars from the literary surgery he performed.<br />By 1989, though, King had enough clout -- and reader support -- to get Doubleday to publish The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition.  Released in hardcover in 1990, the book sold very well and was later adapted by King as a miniseries for ABC-TV.<br />So what are the differences between the two versions of The Stand, besides the heavier weight and higher price? (Remember that<br />$12.95 retail price from 1978? In 1990 this had nearly doubled to $24.95!) Well,  the novel's tale remains the same -- nefarious U.S. military creates a deadly strain of the flu...flu accidentally (and later not so accidentally) infects most of humanity...then the survivors split into two camps, one led by the evil Randall Flagg, the other headed by an elderly woman known as Mother Abigail, thus setting up the ultimate battle between darkness and light.<br />But in this novel, the magic is in the details.  The long and fiery journey of the Trashcan Man across the United States is now more complete, and a frightening character who was completely excised from the original novel in '78 is now restored in a literary equivalent of the Extended Editions of The Lord of the Rings DVDs.<br />Another bonus: Illustrator Bernie Wrightson, who has contributed his drawings and artwork to King's Creepshow, Cycle of the Werewolf and one of the Dark Tower books, has added several illustrations to this edition.  There are just a few and they are sprinkled sparingly, but they add a powerful jolt of visual effects to King's already vivid prose.<br />King acknowledges his penchant for writing big, sometimes rambling novels, and The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition is surely big and rambling. Yet the cast of characters -- Stu Redman, Frannie Goldsmith, Larry Underwood, Harold Lauder (whose descent from merely obnoxious teen to jealousy-driven traitor is one of The Stand's more interesting subplots), Nadine Cross, Nick Andros, Tom Cullen, Lloyd Henreid...and the mysterious entity known as Flagg -- is one of King's best ensembles of fictional creations, and the mythical landscape of post-flu America is truly unforgettable.ing up the ultimate battle between darkness and light.  <br />But in this novel, the magic is in the details.

When most people think of the American strategic bombing offensive against Germany during World War II, usually they see in their imagination the graceful lines of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the Eighth Air Force. Hollywood epics such as Twelve O'Clock High, Command Decision and Memphis Belle reinforce our collective memory of the Flying Forts taking off from Britain on their perilous daylight raids over Hitler's Third Reich, risking life and limb and machine to destroy Germany's industrial capacity and help hasten the end of the war.<br />While the B-17 did, indeed, contribute to the Allied victory in Europe, its dominant role as the U.S. Army Air Force's strategic bomber was a creation of public relations and the media's attention on the \\"sexy\\" Flying Fortress.  The true workhorse of the daylight bombing campaign over Germany was the ungainly Consolidated B-24, aptly given the name Liberator.<br />As the late Stephen E. Ambrose wrote in The Wild Blue: The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s Over Germany 1944-45, the B-24 was built in greater numbers than the more well-known B-17 (over 18,300 in all) and served in every theater of World War II where American forces were engaged.  It had fewer machine guns than the B-17 (10 to the 13 on the Flying Fort), was harder to fly but could carry more bombs and flew slightly faster than the Boeing plane.  It was ungainly, with its twin rudder tail and high-mounted Davis Wing, but it did its job well and did much damage to the enemy war effort.<br />But although much space is devoted to the plane and its effects on Hitler's Reich, Ambrose focuses on the pilots and crews that flew the Liberator on hair-raising daylight raids on German targets.  His narrative is centered on the wartime career of George S. McGovern, a 22-year-old B-24 pilot who hailed from the state of South Dakota and would, almost 30 years later, run for the Presidency against Richard Nixon.  Although Ambrose writes about other B-24 pilots and crewmen, McGovern's evolution from air cadet to bomber pilot flying from Italy over Nazi-held Europe is the heart of this well-written and mesmerizing book.<br />The Wild Blue also sheds some light onto the almost forgotten Italian campaign and the efforts of the Fifteenth Air Force to mount daylight raids over German targets in Austria, Romania and southern Germany.  The D-Day landings in Normandy, the stunning Battle for France and the seemingly unstoppable advance of the Allies in Northwest Europe grabbed most of the headlines after June of 1944, and the public relations focus on the Britain-based Eighth Air Force relegated the Italian campaign to almost a backwater status.  It is fitting that Ambrose's last major work pays a long overdue tribute to the Fifteenth Air Force and the pilots and crews who flew across the wild blue skies to help liberate Europe from Nazi rule.Govern's evolution from air cadet to bomber pilot flying from Italy over Nazi-held Europe is the heart of this well-written and mesmerizing book.<br />The Wild Blue also sheds some light onto the almost forgotten Italian campaign and the efforts of the Fifteenth Air Force to mount daylight raids over German targets in Austria, Romania and southern Germany.

The Bitter Woods, historian John S. D. Eisenhower's insightful account of the Ardennes Counteroffensive in the winter of 1944, is one of the best books yet written about the Battle of the Bulge.  Along with John Toland's 1959 classic Battle: The Story of the Bulge and the late Charles B. MacDonald's A Time for Trumpets, this volume is a must-read for World War II buffs.<br />The Ardennes Counteroffensive was the brainchild of Adolf Hitler himself.  Even as Soviet forces raced toward Berlin from the east and the Western Allies advanced steadily toward the Rhine in the west, the Fuhrer squirreled away hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces plus thousands of soldiers -- some of them either old men over the age of 50 or young boys no older than 16 -- and planned a daring stroke reminiscent of the Third Reich's triumphs in 1939 and 1940.  Three entire armies would strike the Allies in the \\"quiet\\" Ardennes forest region of Belgium and Luxembourg and drive to the crucial port of Antwerp.  Hitler hoped to drive a wedge between the Anglo-Canadian armies in the north and the American armies in the south and cause inter-Allied political strife.  At the very least, the seizure of Antwerp would slow the Allied advance just enough so Nazi Germany could develop \\"wonder weapons\\" and rain V-1 and V-2 missiles on London and other Allied cities. At the very best, the Grand Alliance would fall apart and Hitler might be able to negotiate a separate peace with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.<br />But even though Hitler's offensive caught the Allies by surprise on Dec. 16, 1944 and created much havoc and confusion, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied forces, remained relatively calm.  The Germans did penetrate the thinly held front and created a salient or \\"bulge\\" in the Allied lines, but Eisenhower and his field commanders (Bradley, Hodges, Patton and the various corps and divisional commanders) soon recovered and took decisive measures to contain the German assault.<br />But generals and colonels, no matter how skilled or determined, can't win battles alone.  The Bitter Woods contains many accounts of brave GIs and junior officers who fought tooth and nail to slow and stop Hitler's last desperate gamble in the West. Readers who are just beginning to read about World War II will be in awe of the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division who helped hold the surrounded city of Bastogne, whose capture by the Germans was deemed by Hitler as a principal objective if his plan were to succeed.  (Bastogne is where Brig. Gen Tony McAuliffe replied to the Germans' demand for surrender with the pithy one-word refusal, \\"Nuts!\\") The author, who graduated from West Point in June 1944 and is the Supreme Commander's son, writes about the stand of St. Vith's defenders, the combat engineers who blew bridges in front of the advancing panzer units, the ill-advised massacre of American POWs at Baugnez (the misnamed Malmedy Massacre) by SS troops and the harrowing baptism by fire of the green 106th Infantry Division, which lost two of its regiments in the largest American surrender since Bataan in 1942.<br />Eisenhower also writes extensively about the campaign in Northwest Europe both before and after the Battle of the Bulge, allowing both the new reader and long-time buff to place this, the largest single battle in U.S. Army history (there were, by January of 1945, over 600,000 soldiers involved), in the context of the liberation of Europe from Nazi tyranny.<br />Because the book was originally written in 1969, five years before the revelation of the Ultra secret, the account of the Allies' intelligence failure is not as well-explained as in the 1985 book by Charles MacDonald, but aside from that, The Bitter Woods still stands as one of the finest \\"case studies\\" of a major battle of World War II.lt.<br />But generals and colonels, no matter how skilled or determined, can't win battles alone.

Dillard's third novelization of a Star Trek feature film, is a well-written and exciting tale of two legendary Starfleet captains brought together across the time barrier to save a world from the plans of an obsessive scientist.<br />Dillard (The Lost Years, Mindshadow) adds texture and context to Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore's screenplay for the seventh Star Trek film (and first of four Star Trek: The Next Generation movies) by starting the book right after the events of The Undiscovered Country: Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Original Series' crew splits up -- some retiring from Starfleet, while others accept other assignments.  While this wasn't in the original screenplay or in the final film, this bit of exposition sets up a recurring reverie about time, transitions and even death.<br />Star Trek Generations really gets going in Chapter 2, when Kirk, Chekov and Scotty are the guests of honor at the launching ceremony of the NCC-1701-B, an Excelsior-class ship which is the third starship to bear the name Enterprise.  With an untried captain and with vital equipment not yet installed, a brief publicity cruise to Pluto and back to Earth turns into a perilous rescue mission when a strange energy ribbon ensnares two El-Aurian refugee ships.  Kirk, Scotty and Chekov assist Capt. John Harriman on this life-and-death endeavor, and some of the El-Aurians (including future Enterprise-D bartender Guinan and Dr. Tolian Soran) are rescued...but not without cost.  The Enterprise-B is damaged by the energy ribbon, and Capt. James T. Kirk is missing and presumed dead.<br />After another chapter of original material in which Dillard shows the reaction of Kirk's senior staff to his death, the rest of the novel takes place 78 years later.  The Enterprise-D crew is celebrating Worf's promotion to lieutenant commander in the holodeck, but the festivities are cut short when Capt. Jean Luc Picard receives devastating news from home.  And to make matters worse, someone has savagely attacked the Amargosa Observatory, leaving only one survivor, Dr. Tolian Soran....the same man rescued from the energy ribbon nearly 80 years before by the Enterprise-B.<br />Soon, Picard has to overcome his grief to stop Soran from destroying a star (and its orbiting inhabited planets) to cause the mysterious energy ribbon -- known as the Nexus -- to change course.  Picard must discover why Soran wants to sacrifice billions of innocent lives in order to \\"go into the Nexus\\" -- and he'll need the help of a legendary Starfleet captain from the past to stop the obsessed madman.....<br />To her credit, Dillard explains Soran's motivations far better than the movie did, and her depictions of the movie's characters are vivid and well-done.  Of course, some of her additional material was needed to make up for the non-appearance of Spock and McCoy in the final drafts of Braga and Moore's screenplay (and the final film), and one scene with Kirk -- which was filmed -- was later changed, but those minor detours are to be expected in novelizations such as this.rse, someone has savagely attacked the Amargosa Observatory, leaving only one survivor, Dr. Tolian Soran....the same man rescued from the energy ribbon nearly 80 years before by the Enterprise-B.<br />Soon, Picard has to overcome his grief to stop Soran from destroying a star (and its orbiting inhabited planets) to cause the mysterious energy ribbon -- known as the Nexus -- to change course.

Bright Star, Harold Coyle's third novel and second in a continuing series following the careers of various Army officers, is an intriguing and very human look at the lives of professional soldiers both on the home front and on the field of battle.<br />Set sometime before the fall of the Soviet Union and after the events of Sword Point, Bright Star once again features Scott Dixon, Hal Cerro, Nikolai Ilvanich and Fay Dixon (Scott's wife) and introduces television reporter Jan Fields, a rising star in a cable news network and former colleague of Fay's.<br />The novel starts on a somber note as Major (promotable) Dixon sits at his home computer writing a letter of resignation from the Army he has served and loved for years.  The war in Iran has left an emotional scar, and his wife's hopes for a return to her journalism career after Scotty's expected after-20-year retirement have been put on hold by her husband's deployment to fight the Soviets in the Persian Gulf.  The strains of the conflict -- nightmares of battles for Scott, the sudden upending of long-made plans for Fay -- create a vast emotional chasm between husband and wife.<br />But Dixon is a soldier to his very marrow, and although he is listless and even resigned to accept whatever backwater job he's offered by his superiors, Scotty tosses the letter of resignation away and waits for new orders to be cut, much to Fay's discontent.<br />And when a UH-60 helicopter carrying Lt. Col. William Dedinger is shot down in Sudan by a guerrilla team, Scott Dixon, Medal of Honor winner, is assigned to serve as the chief of staff of the 2nd U.S. Corps (Forward) in Cairo, Egypt.  There, he's to assist in the expected prepositioning of Army equipment in that cautiously friendly Middle Eastern country, in addition to other, more classified tasks.  It's a mostly desk-bound assignment, very much the opposite of the combat-geared armored task force command he declined around the same time he was contemplating leaving the Army.<br />Naturally, Scotty's new posting and promotion to light colonel don't do anything to help heal the growing rift with his wife, who is forced to cancel her acceptance of a job with CBS to accompany Scott to Cairo.  And although she does get another job with her former college roommate and friend Jan Fields, the sojourn to Egypt will have unhappy consequences.<br />Meanwhile, the ambitions of Libyan Col. Nafissi will soon lead to another conflict that will once again pit the United States and the Soviet Union against each other as the superpowers go to the assistance of their client states -- Egypt and Libya.  Soon the desert sands are littered with wrecked tanks and dead soldiers as fierce battles are waged on the air, land, sea....and the hearts of combat veterans such as Scotty Dixon and Capt. Hal Cerro.rmy.<br />Naturally, Scotty's new posting and promotion to light colonel don't do anything to help heal the growing rift with his wife, who is forced to cancel her acceptance of a job with CBS to accompany Scott to Cairo.

One of the things I like about Stephen King is his versatility as a storyteller.  Yes, he focuses on horror and the supernatural -- telekinetic teenagers, vampires, creatures from other dimensions and even a really &quot;killer&quot; flu -- and is therefore not considered to be a &quot;serious&quot; writer.  However, considering the vast output of King books and his longevity as a bestselling author, if nearly 30 years of novels, short story collections, screenplays, original teleplays and a loyal fan base doesn't make him a serious writer, I don't know what would.<br />I used to buy each new King novel either in paperback or, when I could afford it, in hardcover.  Gradually my tastes shifted to military fiction by Tom Clancy, Stephen Coonts and Harold Coyle, but I never stopped liking King's books.<br />One of my favorites is his 1987 excursion into fantasy, The Eyes of the Dragon.  Essentially a story for younger readers -- aimed at kids 12 and up -- and beautifully illustrated by David Palladini, it's a classic story of sibling rivalry between the sons of King Roland of Delain. Peter, the bright and handsome first-born, is heir to the throne, while Thomas, who is not as smart and takes after his short and stout father, tries hard to cope with the knowledge that his status in life is secondary to Peter's.  Worse, even though he tries hard to gain the love of his father, Thomas is clumsy and not very skilled with his hands. (In one sad scene, Thomas spends a whole day making a small wooden sailboat for his father the King, only to hear his dad remark that it looked like a dog dropping with a handkerchief attached to it.)<br />Thomas' only friend is the court magician, a pale and brooding fellow named Flagg.  He takes a keen interest in Thomas, but not for altruistic reasons.  For Flagg is an inhuman entity in the guise of a man, and he has a dark agenda of his own: to rid Delain of both Roland and Pete so he can take the reins of power for himself.  Knowing that the late Queen Sasha was too smart to be manipulated by any of his spells or shrewd manipulations, Flagg set in motion both Thomas' conception and his mother's murder.  Slowly, surely, the evil wizard feeds upon and helps stoke Thomas' resentment of his smarter, handsomer brother....all the better to manipulate the well-meaning but weak-willed Prince Thomas when Flagg pulls off his evil scheme.....<br />The Eyes of the Dragon is decidedly different from King's normally huge novels, but his tone is remarkably evocative of an oral storyteller.  I like the way he sometimes goes back and forth in the story to show a seemingly trivial detail (such as Sasha's dollhouse) and then reintroduce it later as a critical plot device. The story itself is charming, and even though it is a story for older children, adults will enjoy The Eyes of the Dragon's mix of fairy tale and classic King supernatural chills.the late Queen Sasha was too smart to be manipulated by any of his spells or shrewd manipulations, Flagg set in motion both Thomas' conception and his mother's murder.

One of the deadliest weapons used in naval warfare during the two World Wars was the submarine.  In the Atlantic, Germany's U-boats did extensive damage to Allied shipping and twice threatened to starve Britain.  In the Pacific, the Japanese submarine force, tied to a rigid doctrine of stalking enemy capital ships, scored a few outstanding kills of carriers and the USS Indianapolis but did little to harm Allied cargo ships.<br />In Clay Blair, Jr.'s Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War against Japan, reissued by the U.S. Naval Institute (the same publishing company to release a Tom Clancy novel) after several decades of being out of print, is a fascinating and detailed look at the officers, sailors and submarines of the Silent Service and their nearly four-year-long campaign against Japan's Imperial Navy and her Merchant Fleet.<br />Blair, himself a former submariner, pulls no punches and details the many difficulties faced by the American submarine force. Sub skippers who in peacetime were among the best often failed the test of battle. The S-class boats were too slow, had fewer torpedo tubes than the newer T and Gato-class fleet boats.  Like Japan's submarine force, targeting priority was on capital fleet units (battleships, carriers and cruisers). Worst of all, the Mark XIV torpedo, the Navy's wonder weapon, proved to be less than wonderful until Admiral Charles Lockwood, Commander, Submarines, Pacific Fleet (ComSubPac) and other officers fixed several defects in the arming mechanism.<br />But once the Navy fixes most of its personnel- and torpedo-related problems and unleashes the Silent Service against Japanese merchant shipping, the efforts of admirals such as Lockwood, Ralph Christie, James Fife, Robert English (Lockwood's predecessor as ComSubPac before his death in a plane crash) and Richard Voge pay off as hundreds of Japanese freighters, troop transports and, more critically, tankers go to the bottom of the Pacific, crippling the island Empire's ability to sustain its war effort.  In conjunction with the loss of island territories to the Allied soldiers and Marines advancing from several directions and the bombing campaign that got underway in 1944, the submarine force had placed a stranglehold on Japan's economy, doing to the Japanese what the Germans had failed to do to Britain.<br />Highly detailed and full of colorful characters and suspense-filled descriptions of undersea warfare, Silent Victory is a must-read for any buffs of naval warfare and World War II history.  Interestingly, this book was cited as one of the sources of information for MicroProse's classic World War II submarine simulations &quot;Silent Service&quot; and &quot;Silent Service II.&quot;ty to sustain its war effort.

Kathy Tyers' Star Wars: The Truce at Bakura, first published in 1994, is an enjoyable &quot;expanded universe&quot; novel featuring the heroes from the Classic Trilogy in a tale set almost right after Return of the Jedi.  In this novel that pits both Imperial and Alliance forces against a new extragalactic threat, Tyers weaves a tapestry full of adventure, excitement, political intrigue, thrilling space battles and even a little bit of romance.<br />As the novel begins, Luke Skywalker -- still feeling the effects of his battle with the Emperor only the day before -- takes his X-wing fighter out on a routine flight over the moon of Endor. But almost as soon as he is space borne and flying amidst the battle-scarred Rebel fleet, Luke must rescue his friend and fellow pilot Wedge Antilles; while inspecting an intercepted Imperial message drone, Wedge has triggered off a security device and risks losing his hand...or even his life.  Using his Jedi powers and fighting the painful and debilitating aftershocks of Palpatine's Force lightning strikes, Luke saves Wedge and the message drone is retrieved.<br />In it, the Alliance discovers, the Imperial governor of Bakura, unaware that the second Death Star has been destroyed and that the Emperor is gone, warns Palpatine that a new threat against the Empire has emerged.  Bakura is under attack by a powerful alien task force and half of the Imperial forces have been destroyed.<br />Knowing that Bakura has only been under Imperial control for three years and hoping the system will leave the Empire out of gratitude for aid from the Alliance, the Rebel leaders send a small force commanded by Luke, while his sister Leia, accompanied by Han Solo, Chewbacca and See Threepio, volunteers to negotiate a truce with the devious Wilek Nereus, the Imperial governor.<br />Soon, Rebel and Imperial forces unite to fight off the reptilian Ssi-ruuk, intelligent dinosaur-like creatures (they resemble velociraptors) that can entrap the life forces of sentient beings inside droid fighters. Enticed by a deal proposed by the now-dead Palpatine to exchange this technology for -- one supposes -- thousands of the Empire's undesirable captives, the Ssi-ruk have made their way to Imperial territory. Now, having no one to bargain with, the aliens have come to conquer the human-ruled Galactic Empire.<br />On Bakura, Luke will feel the first stirrings of romantic attraction to the beautiful Bakuran Senator Gaeriel Captison, a young woman who not only believes in the stability the Empire offers the galaxy, but is also a follower of the Cosmic Balance, a religion whose basic teachings state that the Jedi are more a threat than a boon to the galaxy.  Their use of the Force upset the cosmic balance and caused the resulting chaos and strife that led to the rise of the Empire.  In addition, Luke and Leia must deal with two very different Imperial officers: the wily and untrustworthy Gov. Nereus and the more diplomatic Commander Pter Thanas, captain of the small Imperial cruiser Dominant.  Together, they must defeat the Ssi-ruuk and hope that the truce at Bakura holds long enough for the combined force of Imperials and Rebels to turn back this alien invasion.of sentient beings inside droid fighters.

The Second World War was the defining event that shaped the 20th century.  Every major world power of the day participated, some siding with the Axis powers, most others taking up the Allied cause and a few even switched sides as the fortunes of war first favored one band, then the other.  Over 50 million people, most of them civilians, died.  Millions more were wounded, held captive, or rendered homeless by invasion and aerial bombardment.  Nearly every European country became a battlefield, as well as North Africa, China, India, Southeast Asia and the vast reaches of the world's oceans.  Its outcome -- Germany, Italy and Japan defeated, France and Britain relegated to second-rate powers as the United States and the Soviet Union gained superpower status, the beginning of the Cold War and the constant fear of a Third World War -- shaped the rest of the century and sowed some of the seeds of this new century's conflicts.<br />There are, of course, many reference books about World War II on the market, and Norman Polmar and Thomas B. Allen's World War II: America at War 1941-1945 is one of the best affordable volumes.  With, as its cover blurb states, \\"more than 2,400 encyclopedic entries on battles, weapons, people, places, and events,\\" this 1991 work is engrossing and informative.<br />America at War is divided into four main sections. First, the essay Prologue to War 1919-1941 sets the stage for history's worst conflict by explaining how the end of World War I, the various post-war revolutions all over Europe, the rise of ultra nationalist and dictatorial regimes in Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union, American isolationism, French and British pacifism, the Great Depression and other forces all contributed to the outbreak of war.  The rise of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and the Japanese militarists is charted, as are the various crises (the Spanish Civil War, Japan's incursions into China and Italy's invasion of Ethiopia) that culminated with the outbreak of what was first called the European War on Sept. 1, 1939, the day Nazi Germany invaded Poland. The essay briefly describes the war's first two years and concludes with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.<br />The second section is a 52-page long War Chronology that covers most of World War II, with an emphasis on American involvement.  It is not a complete chronology (although there is a very rare and expensive day-by-day volume in existence); nevertheless, it's well written and informative.<br />The bulk of America at War is the War Guide A - Z. From \\"A:  Japanese code name for the capture of Rabaul\\" to \\"Zyklon-B: Chemical used to produce lethal gas in Nazi death camps,\\" over 2,400 entries on the personalities, weapons, political and strategic issues and, of course, battles of World War II in every theater (not just battles involving Americans, though the emphasis is on the war starting with American involvement. The entries are, on average, from one to three paragraphs in length, although a few items (such as the Pearl Harbor attack) take up two to four pages and often have maps or photographs.<br />In a book of such ambitious scope, errors will sometimes slip by. In one glaring case, the isolationist organization America First Committee is consistently mislabeled \\"American First.\\"  But on the whole the War Guide is impressively well researched and addictive; World War II buffs will find themselves going back and forth through the cross-referenced entries as they hunt for data on favorite aircraft, military commanders and specific battles or campaigns.  There are even entries detailing the various levels of involvement in the war by Latin America and shedding light on the little-known and almost forgotten contributions of Brazil's Expeditionary Force in Italy and Mexico's Mexican Air Unit, a \\"squadron that flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighters and saw action in the Pacific.\\"<br />The essay Epilogue to War 1946-1990 covers the period that the late President John F. Kennedy(whose war service is noted in the K section, as is his father's isolationist/defeatist stance as Ambassador to Great Britain from 1938 to 1940) called \\"a hard and bitter peace.\\"  The Cold War between East and West...the Arab-Israeli conflict...Vietnam... the tearing down of the Berlin Wall.... All of these were part of the legacy of World War II.  It is a carefully crafted and revealing analysis of all the side effects the war left behind after the major powers ceased fire in 1945, and chronicles the rise and fall of the former Soviet Union and the emergence of the United States as the globe's remaining superpower, ending on a reflective yet carefully optimistic note.<br />This (unfortunately) out of print book is a fine and valuable reference work not just for historians or World War II buffs, but for anyone who has an interest in the deeds and misdeeds that helped shape the world as we know it today, and especially for anyone who has a family connection to the dwindling \\"Greatest Generation\\" of Americans who served their country and helped save the world from tyranny.edy (whose war service is noted in the K section, as is his father's isolationist/defeatist stance as Ambassador to Great Britain from 1938 to 1940) called \\"a hard and bitter peace.\\"  The Cold War between East and West...the Arab-Israeli conflict...Vietnam... the tearing down of the Berlin Wall....

Over the past 40 years, no event in American history has been so scrutinized or conjectured about than the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Millions of words have been written about that tragic day in Dallas: Some point the finger of blame solely at Lee Harvey Oswald, while others weave a confusing web of conspiracy theories that accuse the Mafia, French criminals, Fidel Castro, anti-Castro Cuban exiles and/or militarists in the government who wanted to expand America's role in Vietnam.<br />One of the best books on the Kennedy assassination is the late Jim Bishop's gripping The Day Kennedy Was Shot, a detailed hour-by-hour account of the events of November 22, 1963, starting with the President's 7:00 AM wake-up at Fort Worth's Hotel Texas and ends 20 hours later in Washington, DC.  Bishop follows all the major players -- JFK, Jackie, Lyndon B. Johnson, Oswald, Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby -- and eyewitnesses -- Helen Ganss, an elderly Ft. Worth widow who had been allowed to stay at the Hotel Texas even when the other guests were moved out by the Secret Service; Linnie Mae Randall, an Irving, Texas housewife who, while washing the dishes in her kitchen, she &quot;saw Lee Harvey Oswald, bare head down, coming up Fifth Street with a long package in his hand.  He held the fat part under his arm; the tapered end was pointing at the sidewalk.  The rain didn't seem to bother him. He walked steadily, up Fifth, across the corner lot, toward Mrs. Randall's garage.  She kept watching him, a dark, pretty woman with shoulder-length black hair.  By rote, she set the dishes upright in the drain.&quot;<br />John F. Kennedy had less than six hours left to live, of course, but while turning the pages of Bishop's 1968 book one feels the tension building up with each seemingly mundane detail (such as Mrs. Randall's dishes).  The reader knows that once the President's party leaves the Hotel Texas for Carswell Air Force Base to board Air Force One for that short hop to Love Field, his fate is sealed.<br />Bishop, working from various sources despite Mrs. Kennedy's attempts to block publication of his book, describes every minute detail of those tragic 20 hours -- from the rainy weather over Texas to the bloodstained pink dress that Jackie Kennedy wore throughout that horrible day -- in crisp and clear prose.ove Field, his fate is sealed.  <br />Bishop, working from various sources despite Mrs. Kennedy's attempts to block publication of his book, describes every minute detail of those tragic 20 hours -- from the rainy weather over Texas to the bloodstained pink dress that Jackie Kennedy wore throughout that horrible day -- in crisp and clear prose.	2003-11-19

Although the current Star Wars Expanded Universe novels first appeared in 1991 with the publication of Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, the adventures based on characters and situations created by George Lucas hit the bookstores between 1977 and 1980.  Marvel Comics followed its six-issue adaptation of Lucas' film with its own &quot;continuing adventures,&quot; while novelist Brian Daley followed the exploits of Han Solo and Chewbacca before their fateful involvement with the Rebellion.<br />Alan Dean Foster, the uncredited ghostwriter for Lucas' novelization of Star Wars, followed the further adventures of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in Splinter of the Mind's Eye. Set shortly after the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star, the novel is an atmospheric, almost Indiana Jones-like story pitting Luke and Leia (accompanied by R2-D2 and C-3PO) against Imperial forces in a desperate race to find the mystical Kaiburr Crystal, a gem which has the ability to focus and enhance the power of the Force.<br />Although Splinter of the Mind's Eye is more character-driven than action-oriented (space battle fans will be disappointed), the novel is true to its heritage and has its share of cliffhanger situations, a new cast of rogues, outlaws, aliens, and villains (Captain-Supervisor Grammel is one of the vilest servants of the Emperor).  There is even a climactic lightsaber duel between the very untrained Luke and the evil Lord Darth Vader.<br />Foster's familiarity with Lucas' characters and situations helps keep this otherwise planetbound story interesting and lively.  Although Han and Chewbacca are absent from Splinter (Luke only makes a passing reference to the Corellian when he asks Leia what Governor Tarkin had done to her before her rescue from the Death Star), Luke and Leia's characters get a chance to shine on stage.  Luke is still a bit of a farmboy-turned-Alliance pilot with latent Jedi powers here, and the Princess is still as fast with her biting wit as she is with a blaster.  Foster also emphasizes Luke's conflicting feelings toward Leia...he loves her, but knows (or suspects) he has to protect her at all costs, even from himself.  (If this sounds weird, keep in mind that in 1978 nobody knew that Luke and Leia were twins!)<br />Readers of Laurent Bouzerau's The Annotated Screenplays will recognize that Foster's plot is actually based on a discarded plot for what would become A New Hope.  Part of the original story revolved around the quest for &quot;a Kyber Crystal&quot; -- a gem that a Force-user could utilize to enhance his or her powers; Luke was supposed to have used this &quot;Kyber Crystal&quot; to help him make that &quot;one-in-a-million&quot; shot to destroy the Death Star.it as she is with a blaster.

Over the years, many books have been written about Star Trek's growth from a popular-yet-low-rated television series to the huge cultural phenomenon it is today.  Some are strictly technical (Gene Roddenberry and Stephen Whitfield's The Making of Star Trek), others are a mix of in-depth analysis and insider's insights (David Gerrold's The World of Star Trek), while still others are personal memoirs (William Shatner's Star Trek Memories).  Most of them describe the growing pains of Roddenberry's concept of &quot;Wagon Train to the Stars&quot; and tell the now-familiar story of how NBC commissioned two pilots (rejecting &quot;The Cage&quot; for being too cerebral); how the fans saved the show for a second season but couldn't stop NBC from cancelling Star Trek in 1969; how those same fans kept the spirit of Star Trek alive during the &quot;in-between&quot; decade from the show's debut in syndication to the release of 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br />J.M. Dillard, author of many Star Trek novels (The Lost Years, Mindshadow, plus five movie novelizations), contributed the text for Star Trek: Where No One Has Gone Before -- A History in Pictures.  Published shortly after Star Trek: The Next Generation ended its seven season run and before both the premiere of the seventh feature film and the debut of Star Trek's third spin-off, Voyager, Where No One Has Gone Before covers Star Trek's first 28 years, from its creative genesis as the proposed chronicles of Starfleet Capt. Robert April and the Starship Yorktown to the pre-production of Star Trek: Voyager (which ended its run in 2001).<br />Although its well-written and includes two essays by the late great Isaac Asimov, informative sidebars in each chapter and an introduction by William Shatner, Where No One Has Gone Before's main asset is the wealth of pictures, many of them publicty shots of the several casts, but also many stills from the Original Series, the short-lived animated series, the first seven Star Trek features, and the first two spinoff series.<br />And even though it is a history of Star Trek, don't look for juicy &quot;dark&quot; revelations about the troubles (real or imagined) behind the scenes.

Glut's novelization of Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay for Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, based on a story by George Lucas, is among one of the better adaptations in the continuing saga of the Galactic Civil War and the adventures of Luke Skywalker.<br />Three years after the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance is fighting for its very existence.  Though they had won a significant victory with the destruction of the Death Star, the evil lord Darth Vader survived and made his way to the Imperial capital, where Emperor Palpatine gave him the ultimate assignment -- to find and destroy the Rebel leadership and crush the Rebellion once and for all.  For three years Vader's Imperial Death Squadron of six Star Destroyers -- including his own massive flagship -- has pursued the Rebels from system to system.<br />Vader is driven, too, to find one Rebel commander in particular: Luke Skywalker. Sometime after the defeat at Yavin, Vader discovered that Luke was the pilot who, with the assistance of the mystical energy field known as the Force, fired the torpedo that destroyed the Death Star.  Realizing the young Rebel's untapped -- and untrained -- Jedi powers, Vader has made it his mission in life to capture Luke and, eventually, turn him to the dark side of the Force.<br />So when an Imperial probe droid spots evidence of a hidden Rebel base on the remote ice world of Hoth, Vader unleashes his legions of stormtroopers against the small Rebel force.  In a brief but violent battle, the Empire overwhelms the Alliance troops fighting a rear-guard action, but the bulk of the Rebels, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Luke, and the droids escape.<br />Vader doesn't know, however, that the Star Warriors have set out on diverging paths.  While Han, Chewie, Leia and See Threepio fly off in the damaged Millennium Falcon in a desperate attempt to rejoin the Rebel fleet, Luke and Artoo are on their X-wing starfighter on a different mission altogether.  For the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader's former Jedi Master and now Luke's spirit-guide, has sent Luke to the Dagobah system.  There, he will seek Yoda, the Jedi Master who first instructed Kenobi.<br />Although Glut (like all Star Wars adapters) had to use an earlier draft of Kasdan's screenplay (Yoda, for instance, is described as being bluish and with long white hair parted in the middle), he is a good enough writer and captures the essence of the film's characters and new settings.it of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader's former Jedi Master and now Luke's spirit-guide, has sent Luke to the Dagobah system.

In 1983, in an attempt to keep fans from discovering some of the plot revelations in the film Return of the Jedi, Lucasfilm and Del Rey held off the release of James Kahn's novelization until the last minute.  It proved to be unnecessary; in its cover story on Jedi a few weeks before the premiere on May 25th, 1983, Time magazine revealed to the world (in page 84) that Darth Vader was indeed Luke Skywalker's father.  Other plot threads were revealed in various publications, rendering the &quot;hold&quot; of Kahn's novel moot.<br />Return of the Jedi is divided into two halves, one almost independent of the other but predetermined by the events of The Empire Strikes Back.  The first half begins with a short prologue in which Darth Vader arrives at Endor, a small sanctuary moon where the Empire is building a second Death Star.  The Emperor, it seems, is not happy with Moff Jerjerrod's &quot;current lack of progress&quot; and has sent the Dark Lord to &quot;find new ways to motivate&quot; the Death Star commander and his men to complete the battle station as planned.<br />Then, using material later deleted from the final draft of the screenplay Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, Luke is in Ben Kenobi's spartan hut, hard at work on his new lightsaber.  Then Kahn takes up the film's plot threads and describes how Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and Luke rescue Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.<br />The second half of Jedi starts with Luke returning to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training, only to find that Yoda, his 900-year-old Master, is dying.  &quot;No more training do you require,&quot; says Yoda on his deathbed, but warns Luke that the true final examination as a Jedi will be to confront Darth Vader.<br />&quot;Luke knew this would be his test,&quot; Kahn writes, &quot; it could not be otherwise. Every quest had its focus, and Vader was at the core of Luke's struggle.  It was agonizing for him to put the question to words, but after a long silence, he again spoke to the old Jedi 'Master Yoda -- is Darth Vader my father?'<br />&quot;Yoda's eyes filled with a weary compassion. This boy was not yet a man complete.  A sad smile creased his face, he seemed to grow smaller in his bed....<br />&quot;Luke stared at the dwindling teacher, trying to give the old one strength, just by the force of his love and will. 'Yoda, I must know,' he whispered.<br />&quot; 'Your father he is,' Yoda said simply.&quot;<br />Kahn then follows the three separate threads of the Battle of Endor: a mission led by Han to destroy the shield generator that provides the unfinished Death Star's main protection; Lando Calrissian's starfighter attack on the battle station itself; and Luke's desperate personal struggle to reclaim his father from the thrall of the evil Emperor Palpatine. It is classic Star Wars action, with heroic deeds, huge space battles, and a final, decisive clash of lightsabers between father and son.<br />Kahn, who is also a recovering emergency room doctor and has published a science fiction trilogy of his own, has done several novelizations of movie scripts, including Poltergeist and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  His style is clear and snappy, although Foster and Glut seem to have a certain quality that Kahn can't replicate.ce, he again spoke to the old Jedi 'Master Yoda -- is Darth Vader my father?' <br />&quot;Yoda's eyes filled with a weary compassion.

In late 1976, Ballantine Books published the first edition of Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, a novel by George Lucas.  Adorned only with conceptual art by Ralph McQuarrie, it did not set the literary world on fire.  As it turned out, however, the \\"major motion picture\\" it was heralding on its cover blurb became one of the biggest box office hits ever, and Star Wars went on to become a huge part of our culture.<br />Although it really wasn't George Lucas who wrote this first published tie-in to what would later be called Episode IV: A New Hope, the novel reflects the director's vision.  Author Alan Dean Foster, who had adapted the scripts of the Star Trek animated series into the Star Trek Logs books, took Lucas' fourth revised draft and wrote a masterful adaptation that truly captures the spirit of the movie's characters and situations.<br />Star Wars begins with a short prologue that, with a few \\"special modifications\\" in the text, is really the outline for the current Prequel Trilogy.  In the form of an excerpt from \\"the first saga -- Journal of the Whills,\\" we are told that the once-powerful Galactic Republic, protected by the Jedi Knights, \\"throve and grew. But as often happens when wealth and power pass the admirable and attain the awesome, then appear those evil ones who have greed to match.\\"  Insidiously, like a house under attack by termites, the Republic rotted from within until \\"[a]ided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic....Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor....\\"<br />The novel then segues directly into the famous opening scene of Star Wars: an Imperial Star Destroyer (called here an Imperial cruiser) chases Princess Leia's Rebel Blockade Runner and captures it over the desert planet of Tatooine. After a brief battle, Imperial stormtroopers take over the ship, and Leia is taken before Lord Darth Vader, who wants to know what she did with secret data \\"transmitted by Rebel spies.\\"<br />Leia, of course, has wisely hidden the data -- the plans of the Empire's ultimate superweapon, the Death Star -- into the memory banks of Artoo Detoo, an astromech droid.  Artoo and his loyal but easily rattled counterpart, See-Threepio, have managed to flee aboard a tiny escape pod down to the hostile wastes of Tatooine.  They are \\"found\\" by jawas, a race of small desert scavengers, then sold to a moisture farmer named Owen Lars and his nephew Luke Skywalker....and when Luke stumbles on a fragment of a message for someone named \\"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\\" well, things really get interesting.<br />Foster's novelization is very faithful to its screenplay source, and even the \\"added\\" material (Luke's first appearance in the novel as he repairs a vaporator, or scenes with Biggs and his friends at Tosche Station) comes from Lucas' fourth revised draft (available in Carol Titleman's The Art of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope).  Most of the \\"deleted scenes\\" later appeared in Brian Daley's Star Wars: The Radio Drama), and the encounter between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt (spelled Hut in this novel) was restored and tweaked with CGI in the 1997 Special Edition re-release.  Of the three Classic Trilogy novels, this is the best-written.  Foster's style is crisp yet elegant, and it does not read like it's a screenplay adaptation.<br />The original 1976 hardcover edition (which I own thanks to the kindness of my best friend Rogers) includes 16 pages of promotional pictures and character profiles of the major roles. It's been since reissued several times, either singly or as part of omnibus collections in both paperback and hardcover, with different variants of cover art.Leia is taken before Lord Darth Vader, who wants to know what she did with secret data \\"transmitted by Rebel spies.\\" <br />Leia, of course, has wisely hidden the data -- the plans of the Empire's ultimate superweapon, the Death Star -- into the memory banks of Artoo Detoo, an astromech droid.

Following the success of Team Yankee, a depiction of World War III as seen from company level, Harold Coyle achieved acclaim with Sword Point, a novel pitting the United States and the Soviet Union in armed conflict in Iran.<br />Set in the late 1980s, Sword Point begins with the peacetime routine of an American Army unit in the middle of a training exercise at Ft. Campbell, Ky. In a scene that mixes Coyle's fine eye for detail and wry humorous touches, Staff Sergeant Donald Duncan's infantry platoon carefully sets up an ambush against an OPFOR (opposing force):<br />&quot;The ensuing firefight would short but bloodless. The men of both Duncan's platoon and the OPFOR....were using MILES, short for &quot;multiple integrated laser engagement system.&quot;  Each weapon was tipped with a rectangular gray box which emitted a laser beam every time the weapon was fired.  Every man....had laser detectors on his helmet and web gear that would detect the laser from another weapon.  When this happened, a buzzer, also attached to each man's gear, would go off, telling him and his buddies that he was 'dead.'  The use of MILES ensured that there would be no doubt who won and who lost, a far cry from the days when most training exercises degenerated into screaming matches of 'I shot you' and 'No you didn't.' &quot;<br />But as Duncan and his men &quot;struggle&quot; through their training exercise, halfway around the world a Soviet armored column rumbles toward the Iranian border in the predawn darkness. The Soviet leadership has decided to invade -- Coyle never really tells us why -- Iran, planning to conquer the country and reach the Straits of Hormuz in four weeks' time.  Some of the junior Red Army officers are apprehensive -- the Afghan War has taught the Soviets much about the costs of fighting against desperate Muslims -- but Moscow and the Soviet General Staff don't believe there will be much opposition from Iran...or the West.<br />But as soon as the Soviets launch their invasion, America mobilizes, and soon U.S. forces head to the Persian Gulf.  Within weeks, the news are full of images of combat between the two superpowers as battles are fought on air, land and sea.<br />But the Soviets are not the only enemy the American forces face in Iran.  The ayatollahs still rule the Islamic Iranian Republic, and while they fight fiercely against the Russians, the Iranians welcome the U.S. forces not with flowers but with bullets.  And even when Iran's forces are forced to retreat under pressure from both foreign forces, the mullahs who wield power in Tehran pin their hopes on a desperate and deadly gambit that, if it works, will destroy the homelands of the nations the Iranians call the Great and Lesser Satans.<br />But Coyle's talent lies not just with the description of grand strategy, the tactics and weapons used in war, but with the very human portrayal of his cast of characters.  Whether he is writing about Major Scott Dixon of the U.S. Army or Junior Lieutenant Nikolai Ilvanich of the Soviet Army, Coyle wisely doesn't resort to the stereotypical &quot;good guy vs. bad guy&quot; style of storytelling.  Yes, this is a novel of war, but Coyle (a former Army officer who served in Desert Storm) has genuine affection for the profession of arms and the men and women who serve their country, no matter which country it is.invasion, America mobilizes, and soon U.S. forces head to the Persian Gulf.

The trouble with history, particularly modern history, is that events can be interpreted and presented in different ways.  Consider, for instance, the assasination of President John F. Kennedy.  Some books, such as Jim Bishop's The Day Kennedy Was Shot and Gerald Posner's Case Closed, point the finger at Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone gunman.  Others, such as David Lifton's Best Evidence, claim there was a vast conspiracy to shoot Kennedy in Dallas, Texas and to cover this violent coup d'etat up so Lyndon Johnson could be President and escalate the Vietnam War. I don't believe the conspiracy theorists and they'll never get a dime from me, but nevertheless there are plenty of people who do believe Lifton and his other &quot;there was a second gunman in the grassy knoll&quot; compadres.  By taking a fact here, adding a supposition there, and by presenting information selectively to make it fit an author's particular slant, any historical event can be revised...even making outrageous claims seem very credible.<br />Of all the events in President Kennedy's 1,000 day administration (other than the tragedy at Dealey Plaza 40 years ago), perhaps the one that everyone remembers is the 13-day Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.  In most accounts, JFK is taken by surprise when U-2 spy planes photograph Soviet intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBM's) being set up on the island of Cuba, only 90 miles away from U.S. shores. Galvanized by this bit of Soviet sleight of hand, the President and his advisers courageously mobilize American forces, improvise a non-invasive strategy of &quot;quarantining&quot; the communist-ruled island and stare down the wily Khruschev and make the Soviet leader decide between removing the missiles or starting a nuclear war.<br />I admit that I am not a scholar on the Cold War.  I am also not an expert on Cuba or even the Kennedy clan.  But when I read Robert Smith Thompson's The Missiles of October: The Declassified Story of John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis, it soon became apparent that the author is not a fan of JFK.  Indeed, Thompson says the familiar accounts of the crisis (as presented in the recent film Thirteen Days and most histories) is a myth.<br />By cleverly mixing a certain amount of &quot;dirty laundry&quot; related to Kennedy's political career, U.S. foreign policy vis a vis the Soviet Union, the massive political influence of the United Fruit Company in Washington, and even the TFX scandal of the early 1960s, Thompson states that not only did American foreign policy from 1945 on force the Soviet Union to take defensive measures of its own, but that Kennedy (who apparently ran a dirty campaign in 1960 with the assistance of old Joe Kennedy) knew of the Soviet missile buildup far before October 1962.  JFK then, Thompson says, used the crisis for domestic political reasons.<br />Admittedly, Thompson, a professor who teaches foreign policy at the University of South Carolina, is a good prose writer and at times The Missiles of October reads like a technothriller. In the end, though, this book leaves behind a bitter aftertaste with its half-baked conspiracy theories centering on a crisis which could have ended in nuclear war.the Cuban Missile Crisis, it soon became apparent that the author is not a fan of JFK.

Every saga, proclaims the tag line for Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, has a beginning, and every Star Wars movie has a novelization.  Following in the footsteps of Alan Dean Foster, Donald F. Glut and James Kahn is acclaimed fantasy writer Terry Brooks (The Sword of Shannara, among 14 novels), who adapted George Lucas' original screenplay into novel format.<br />Although the Star Wars novels all stick to the basics of their source material, their authors are often able to tack on extra material to set up the situation shortly before the true beginning of the movie. In Brooks' The Phantom Menace, for instance, the first two chapters give the reader more details of young Anakin Skywalker's life in the weeks prior to his fateful meeting with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Brooks describes, for instance, the incident when Anakin's archrival, Sebulba the Dug, intentionally flashes young Skywalker's Podracer with his vents and nearly kills the boy in the resulting crash. Afterward, Anakin, his best friend Kittster Banai, and the young Rodian Wald encounter an old spacer in the town of Mos Espa.  The grizzled veteran amazes the youngsters with his tales of flying fighters and starships, and of missions involving Jedi Knights. Anakin, even at the age of nine, decides that he will not settle for the life of a slave on Tatooine.<br />\\"[He] thought about what it would be like to be out there, flying battle cruisers and fighters, traveling to far worlds and strange places.  He didn't care what Wald said, he wouldn't be a slave all his life.  Just as he wouldn't always be a boy.  He would find a way to leave Tatooine. He would find a way to take his mother with him.  His dreams whirled through his head as he watched the stars, a kaleidoscope of bright images.  He imagined how it would be.  He saw it clearly in his mind, and it made him smile.<br />\\"One day, he thought, seeing the old spacer's face in the darkness before him, the wry smile and strange gray eyes, I'll do everything you've done. Everything.<br />\\"He took a deep breath and held it.<br />\\"I'll even fly with Jedi Knights.<br />\\"Slowly he exhaled, the promise sealed.\\"<br />From the third chapter on, Brooks follows the plot of Lucas' screenplay, starting from the failed attempt by Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi to negotiate an end to the greedy Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo. Despite their reputation for cowardice in the face of a strong challenge, something -- or someone -- is enabling the Neimoidian leaders of the Federation to stand up against the Galactic Republic's attempts to tax the trade routes.  Using a fleet of battleships, the Trade Federation's viceroy, Nute Gunray, threatens to interdict all shipping to the small backwater planet of Naboo, home planet of both Queen Amidala and its representative in the Senate, the unassuming man named Palpatine.<br />Confident that turmoil in the Senate will hinder any response by Supreme Chancellor Valorum and knowing they have the support of a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious, the Neimoidians attempt to dispose of the two Jedi ambassadors and boldly invade Naboo.  Their goal: to capture the teenaged Amidala and force her to sign a treaty that legalizes Federation control of her planet.  Even when the Jedi escape to the planet surface, Gunray and his henchmen don't fret much...until Amidala's cruiser -- with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Jar Jar Binks, the Queen, and a small group of handmaidens and security personnel  aboard -- runs past the Trade Federation blockade.<br />But the cruiser's hyperdrive is damaged during the daring breakout, and the escapees must head to the nearest system not under Trade Federation control.  The only one within range is the desert world of Tatooine, a rough-and-tumble planet controlled by the vile Hutts.  There, the Republic has no presence and scum and villains live side by side with moisture farmers, jawas, and the nomadic and violent Tusken Raiders.<br />The Phantom Menace fills in some of the blanks in the Star Wars backstory, answering such questions as:<br />What were the roots of Anakin Skywalker's anger?<br />How did Artoo Detoo and See Threepio meet?<br />How did Jedi Knights serve as guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic?<br />How did Palpatine rise from sectoral Senator to Supreme Chancellor?<br />Star Wars fans know, of course, the future fate of the major characters of The Phantom Menace and the changes to come in the galaxy.  Palpatine will someday be the Emperor, Obi-Wan Kenobi will end up on Tatooine as one of the last surviving members of the Jedi Order, keeping an eye on Anakin's future son Luke.  Anakin Skywalker, of course, is destined to become the Sith Lord named Darth Vader, and young Queen Amidala will grow up to be Anakin's wife and mother of his two children. Yet Brooks focuses on this transitional time in Anakin's life, when he's still a child with good instincts and big dreams, dropping subtle hints here and there that foreshadow the events that will turn a heroic Jedi into one of the most iconic villains in movie history.lls in some of the blanks in the Star Wars backstory, answering such questions as:<br />What were the roots of Anakin Skywalker's anger?<br />How did Artoo Detoo and See Threepio meet?<br />How did Jedi Knights serve as guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic?<br />How did Palpatine rise from sectoral Senator to Supreme Chancellor?<br />Star Wars fans know, of course, the future fate of the major characters of The Phantom Menace and the changes to come in the galaxy.

Salvatore, author of several New Jedi Order novels (including the series' first entry, Vector Prime) became the first Star Wars author to write a film's novelization when he was assigned to adapt Episode II: Attack of the Clones.<br />Released in hardcover a few weeks before the film's release, Salvatore's novelization of the screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales not only tells the story contained in the final film, but also adds three chapters of backstory establishing Anakin's emotional turmoil and Padme Amidala's inner struggle to find balance between her official duties as Senior Senator from Naboo and her growing awareness of a need for a more personal life.<br />Set 10 years after Anakin Skywalker's departure from Tatooine with Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Attack of the Clones begins with a prologue in which Anakin has a nightmare.  It begins with images of something the young Jedi Padawan longs for...the presence of family and friends...and especially the company of his mother, who he has not seen in a decade.  But the dream -- or is it a Force-vision? -- quickly turns ghastly when his mother's image turns into a garish crystaline figure and shatters.  When he wakes up, sweaty and out of breath, he's forced to focus on his current assignment with his Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, which is to settle a dispute on the planet Ansion (which is described in full in Alan Dean Foster's The Approaching Storm, a prequel to Episode II). Anxious and unsettled, he wants to complete this mission quickly so he can go back to Coruscant and seek guidance, but not from his Master or any of the Masters at the Jedi Temple...but from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.<br />Meanwhile, Anakin's mother Shmi is now no longer Watto's slave and happily married to moisture farmer Cliegg Lars. Although she is now free and loves both her husband and stepson Owen, she misses Anakin and wonders if he did, at last, become a Jedi.  The chapter describing her new life on the Lars homestead sets up both the relationship between Owen and his girlfriend Beru Whitesun (who, of course, will be Shmi's grandson Luke's guardians in the future). Salvatore's expository chapter gives both depth and context  to the later scenes involving Shmi and Anakin.<br />After another brief chapter of backstory, from Chapter Four on Attack of the Clones focuses on the events at the heart of the film.  Ten years have passed since Senator Palpatine's election to the Supreme Chancellorship, but despite his promises to reduce corruption and restore confidence in the Republic, things have become worse. The Trade Federation and various other special-interest groups have joined a secessionist movement that has enticed several thousand systems to leave the Republic.  Led by the charismatic Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master, this movement is gathering more momentum with each passing day, and Palpatine's negotiations are going nowhere.  As the secessionists grow stronger and bolder, hawks in the Senate are pushing for the Military Creation Act, which will, for the first time since the founding of the Republic, set up a centralized army to assist the limited numbers of Jedi Knights.  However, moderates such as Bail Organa of Alderaan and Padme Amidala of Naboo believe that such a move will result in open civil war.<br />When Amidala rushes back to Coruscant to vote against the Military Creation Act, her official starship is destroyed by an unknown assailant and her decoy Corde is killed.  Alarmed by this incident (or so it seems), Palpatine urges the young senator to accept tighter security.  When Amidala tries to object, Palpatine insists that she be guarded and suggests to the Jedi Council that she be placed under the protection of the Jedi...and he knows exactly who to assign: &quot;Perhaps someone you may be familar with...an old friend...like Master Kenobi.&quot;<br />For Obi-Wan Kenobi, the unexpected assignment is simply limited to the protection of the Senator. For Anakin, however, it becomes the catalyst for both renewing his relationship with the woman he loves and to yet again defy his Jedi Master.

Dave Wolverton's Star Wars: The Courtship of Princess Leia chronicles the desperate campaign waged by Han Solo to win Princess Leia's heart even as the New Republic leadership encourages the former senator from Alderaan to marry Prince Isolder of Hapes.<br />It is a time of transition in the galaxy. The Emperor and Darth Vader are dead, and the Galactic Empire is now one-fourth its former size.  Without the unifying influence of Emperor Palpatine and his dark-side powers, Imperial moffs, admirals, and self-appointed warlords are vying for power. Some fight among themselves, while others, such as Warlord Zsinj, employ their Star Destroyers and stormtroopers against the fledgling New Republic.<br />While Han Solo is tracking the elusive and dangerous Zsinj and his Super Star Destroyer, the Iron Fist, Luke Skywalker is scouring the galaxy for data about the Jedi Order, which had been nearly exterminated by Emperor Palpatine and his henchman Darth Vader, who once had been Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father.  Knowing that the New Republic can only survive with the aid of a new order of Jedi, Luke has made it his life's mission to learn all he can about the training of Jedi Knights so he can set up a Jedi Academy. On the planet Toola, in the ruins of a Jedi Master's last hiding place, he finds, with guidance from the Force, a data cylinder which, although damaged by the effects of Imperial grenades, contains a hologram containing mission reports from various Jedi...including his own former Master, Yoda.  &quot;We tried to free the Chu'unthor from Dathomir, but were repulsed by the witches...&quot; Yoda says. The words don't make much sense to the last of the Jedi Knights, but he's determined to find out what, or who, the Chu'unthor was, and to discover how several Jedi Masters and their acolytes could have been forced to retreat.<br />Meanwhile, Han has returned to Coruscant from a long and frustrating search for Zsinj and the Iron Fist, only to find a huge Hapan Battle Fleet in orbit.  Having had run-ins with the xenophobic and closed society of the 63-world strong Hapan Cluster in his early days as a smuggler, Han is apprehensive.  His apprehension turns to dismay when he discovers that the Machiavellian Queen of Hapes, Ta'a Chume is willing to ally her realm with the New Republic if Princess Leia agrees to marry her son, Prince Isolder.<br />Leia is torn between her love for Han and her sense of duty to the Republic, in whose service she has been since her teens.  She doesn't accept right away, but under pressure from both Mon Mothma and the surviving Alderaanian refugee leadership, she does agree to consider it. Angry and dejected, Han goes to a bar and casino in the seamier parts of Coruscant, and joins in on a sabbacc game.  In one lucky hand, the smuggler-turned-General wins the deed to a planet...a planet known as Dathomir.<br />Elated and somewhat recklessly, Han attempts to impress Leia with his new property, hoping that Dathomir can be set up as a substitute for Leia's now-defunct home-world of Alderaan, which had been destroyed by the Empire's first Death Star almost a decade before.  But when Leia seemingly rejects them, Han takes one of Leia's engagement gifts, a Hapan Gun of Command, and uses it to force the strong-willed Princess to accompany him on a trip to Dathomir....a trip that Han hopes will rekindle Leia's love for him.<br />But Ta'a Chume and the New Republic leadership are determined that the wedding take place, so Prince Isolder and Luke Skywalker follow the Millennium Falcon to the mysterious planet of Dathomir, where the witches who defeated Yoda and several other Jedi still reside....<br />Wolverton's novel is fast paced and entertaining, and Han-Leia fans will enjoy reading the ups and downs of this chapter in their romantic history.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the end of the U.S.-Soviet confrontation created both a problem and a challenge to \\"future war\\" novelists: how do you create believable scenarios in which America and her allies fight against possible real-world enemies?  After all, with the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the scaling back of U.S. forces in Europe, a Red Storm Rising-class World War III novel was obsolete.  But at the same time, the military-fiction genre was still very viable...as long as writers came up with credible adversaries to cause havoc in the world.<br />Vortex, Larry Bond and Patrick Larkin's second collaborative effort, is set in early 1990s South Africa before the white minority relinquished its death-grip on power.  It paints a dark scenario of a desperate Boer-dominated government using its military and police to destabilize neighboring \\"black\\" African nations and fight a Marxist-leaning African National Congress and its armed guerrillas.<br />Vortex starts out, as many techno-thrillers often do, with a seemingly isolated event. In the prologue, a team of South African Army commandos and a black ANC turncoat execute a raid on an ANC safe house/headquarters in Gawamba, Zimbabwe. Led by Capt. Rolf Bekker, the South African commandos wipe out an ANC guerrilla cell and capture a safe full of documents (which they photograph and leave apparently undiscovered), then return to their base without serious loss.<br />In Bond's alternate history, years of sanctions and diplomatic isolation have failed to end apartheid and white rule of the Union of South Africa. Instead, the Boers (descendants of South Africa's original Dutch settlers) who dominate the government have become more repressive and paranoid.  For their part, the ANC's leaders have grown weary of waiting for the West to press for change by peaceful means, and Marxist hard-liners have come up with a campaign code named Broken Covenant. Its goal: to win by force what years of negotiations and international condemnation have not...the end of white rule and the establishment of a black-dominated government.  And by the end of the novel, South Africa's internal strife becomes a conflict pitting Anglo-American forces against various opponents, including Cuban Army units sent by Fidel Castro.<br />Bond's depiction of a war in South Africa now seems a bit of a stretch, but given that he was a former naval intelligence officer (and designer of the Harpoon war game), perhaps his research into apartheid-era South African affairs gave him insights that most of his readers didn't have.  At times the depiction of the South African \\"bad guys\\" reminds one of Hitler's Third Reich, especially when Bond and Larkin write about the more die-hard racist government ministers; Karl Vorster, a South African Hitler-like figure and Marius van der Heijden, deputy minister of Law and Order, who seems to have studied under Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, so extreme are his racist views. But as in many World War II novels, there are \\"good\\" South Africans who, when push comes to shove, find the courage to rise against the injustices that they have previously defended.<br />Of course, it helps to have a little mix of romance, youthful rebellion and a healthy dose of American firepower, and as in Red Phoenix, American weaponry and military units play a huge role in Vortex's plot.  In some ways, it's formulaic and the reader knows things will have a rosy ending, but in other ways Vortex is fascinating.  Readers will be surprised to know how puritanical the Boer society was (a friend of mine who visited South Africa in the late '70s said Playboy-style magazines were not sold there) and how tense relations used to be between the Dutch- and English-descended whites.  The officers with English surnames are often distrusted by their Boer counterparts and are often more critical of apartheid than is healthy for their careers.  But just as there are \\"good Germans\\" in WWII fact and fiction, thereare also \\"good Boers\\" who join forces with American and British troops to end the bloody conflict that threatens to end their country's very existence.are also \\"good Boers\\" who join forces with American and British troops to end the bloody conflict that threatens to end their country's very existence.	2003-11-06

Ward, is the companion volume to the outstanding 1990 documentary series from the Public Broadcasting System.  Lavishly illustrated with paintings, photographs and maps, this book tells the dramatic and tragic story of America's bloodiest conflict.<br />Like the television series from which this project was derived, its narrative is both informative and awe-inspiring.  Its prose is lovingly crafted, and one can almost hear the voice of historian-writer David McCullough, who narrated the TV episodes, when reading from any of its five chapters.<br />&quot;By the summer of 1861, Wilmer McLean had had enough,&quot; write the authors in the introduction, The Crossroads of Our Being. &quot;Two great armies were converging on his farm, and what would be the first major battle of the Civil War -- Bull Run, or Manassas as the Confederates called it -- would soon rage across the aging Virginian's farm, a Union shell going so far as to tear through his summer kitchen. Now McLean moved his family away from Manassas, far south and west of Richmond -- out of harm's way, he prayed -- to a dusty crossroads town called Appomatox Court House.  And it was there in his living room three and a half years later that Lee surrendered to Grant, and Wilmer McLean could rightfully say, 'The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.' &quot;<br />Although the hardcover edition is a coffee table sized volume, it is not a terribly long or exhaustive work. There are only five chapters, each one dedicated to a year of the war and followed by an essay by an eminent historian.  My personal favorite is the essay &quot;Men at War&quot; by Shelby Foote, whose award winning three volume history of the Civil War is considered by many to be among the best on the subject. More interview than essay, &quot;Men at War&quot; attempts to explain why Civil War battles were so bloody; &quot;It was brutal stuff,&quot; Foote explains, &quot;and the reason for the high casualties is really quite simple:  the weapons were way ahead of the tactics.&quot;  Foote also discusses the primitive medical techniques of the time, and has this to say about Lee at Gettysburg: &quot;Gettysburg was the price the South paid for having Lee.&quot;  On the issue of who won the war, Foote says, &quot;I can tell you who lost it -- the South lost the war. But I'm not sure anybody won that war.  It's a tragedy.&quot;<br />Other essay writers include Barbara J. Fields, James M. McPherson, Don E. Fehrenbacher and C. Vann Woodward.<br />The Civil War follows the structure of Ken Burns' documentary, and most of the individuals portrayed in the PBS series (ranging from Presidents Lincoln and Davis to Union soldier Elisha Hunt Rhodes -- who rose from private to colonel during the war -- and Confederate soldier-turned-author Sam Watkins) are wonderfully described in the text.<br />While definitely not a substitute for the film on which it's based, The Civil War is a fine book and a good one-volume introduction to the worst internal crisis the American people ever faced.xplains, &quot;and the reason for the high casualties is really quite simple:  the weapons were way ahead of the tactics.&quot;  Foote also discusses the primitive medical techniques of the time, and has this to say about Lee at Gettysburg: &quot;Gettysburg was the price the South paid for having Lee.&quot;  On the issue of who won the war, Foote says, &quot;I can tell you who lost it -- the South lost the war.

As every good storyteller can tell you, it's sometimes good to shake things up a bit, particularly in a long-established franchise as Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series.<br />Since 1984, Clancy's readers have followed John Patrick Ryan's ascent from Annapolis history professor to President of the United States, focusing particularly on Ryan's fast rise within the ranks of the Central Intelligence Agency. From his stint as CIA liaison officer in London to a short and contentious stint as CIA Deputy Director, Clancy's most famous character saw both the good and the dark side of the \\"black world\\" of the intelligence-gathering business.<br />But in order to keep Ryan believable and keep his fans interested, Clancy has shaken things up in the \\"Ryan-verse\\" several times.  In 1991's The Sum of All Fears Clancy placed Ryan in a no-win scenario in which part of a terrorist plot does work -- even though the ultimate goal is not achieved -- and ends his career at CIA.  He also diverted readers' attentions in Without Remorse and Rainbow Six to John Clark, a major (but secondary) player in most of the Jack Ryan novels.  Finally, in a three-novel arc (Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, and The Bear and the Dragon), John Patrick Ryan becomes the nation's Chief Executive.<br />Now, in The Teeth of the Tiger, Clancy stirs things up again by handing off the franchise to the \\"next generation\\" by making John Patrick Ryan, Jr. one of America's newest clandestine agents.<br />It's the early 21st Century. President Ryan is now retired and working on his memoirs.  His wife Cathy is still a surgeon, and their oldest daughter Sally is attending medical school.  In the White House, Edward Kealty (a man whose path to power was once seemingly halted by sexual scandal and his resignation from the Vice Presidency) is now occupant of the Oval Office, having been placed there by his predecessor's assassination.  In this time of transition, the war on terror goes on, and new departments and agencies have been created to fight it.<br />One of these secret agencies is \\"The Campus,\\" run jointly by the military and intelligence communities.  Here, under the cover of a legitimate business outfit known as Hendley Associates, analysts pore over data while field operatives carry out dangerous missions against targeted terrorists.  One of the new analysts is the young, talented, but untried Jack Ryan, Jr.<br />His cousins Dominic and Brian Caruso, twins who have been serving their country well, join young Ryan in The Campus.  Dominic, the FBI agent, has just finished one of his first and most harrowing cases, while Brian, a Marine captain, has recently completed a tour of duty in Afghanistan.  While Ryan possesses his father's sharp intellect and analytical skill, his cousins have the investigative and combat skills necessary for field assignments.<br />And when a Muslim terrorist group joins forces with a Colombian drug cartel to inflict grievous damage upon their common American enemy, these three young rookies will pit their courage and skills against this new and nefarious confederacy of evil.<br />Fast paced and crisply written, Clancy's latest novel dares to take chances by changing the familiar Ryan-verse in unexpected ways.  The introduction of a new generation of protagonists allows the author to avoid the President-Ryan-faces-another-international-crisis while showing readers the fates of familiar characters from previous novels, even though not all the developments are happy ones.  All in all, however, The Teeth of the Tiger is still an entertaining work, despite its brevity (by Clancy standards) and cliffhanger ending.been created to fight it.<br />One of these secret agencies is \\"The Campus,\\" run jointly by the military and intelligence communities.

Having saved the Prince and Princess of Wales from a terrorist plot, Ryan is assigned by CIA Deputy Director (Intelligence) James Greer to London, where he will be part of a CIA Liaison Team working side by side with British intelligence analysts.  Their mission: to keep abreast of events and developments in the Soviet Union.<br />It is a time of transition in the Soviet Empire.  Leonid Brezhnev is dead, and former KGB director Yuri Andropov is General Secretary of the Communist Party.  Soviet forces are still &quot;pacifying&quot; Afghanistan, and two world figures in the West have surfaced as potentially dangerous adversaries in the struggle between the Capitalist World and the Soviet Union.  One of them is America's new President, Ronald Reagan, whose &quot;cowboy&quot; image and strong rhetoric about rebuilding the long neglected U.S. defense establishment and open disdain for communism are, at the very least, worrisome to Andropov and the Politburo.<br />Closer to home, and therefore more troubling, is the threat posed by Pope John Paul II, a Polish cardinal elevated to the papacy after his predecessor's short reign.  Although the Pope has no armies or nuclear weapons, his strong will, his anticommunist beliefs, and his nationality (Poland was then part of the Warsaw Pact, back in 1981) combine to make John Paul II more dangerous to the U.S.S.R. than the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Pope can be used as a symbol of anticommunism around which the restive Polish nation can rally. With the opposition gathering strength and the Solidarity union movement creating havoc to communist-dominated Poland's centralized economy, Andropov fears a general revolt in all the Soviet satellite states.  Knowing that the Soviet Union would probably fall apart if its &quot;fraternal socialist brotherhood&quot; were to break away, Andropov decides that if the Pope cannot be cowed into silence, he must be done away with.  And after a document called the Warsaw Letter reaches his desk, Andropov chooses to order an operation to silence the Pope...forever.<br />Clancy has mixed fact and fiction before in the &quot;Ryan-verse,&quot; most notably in The Hunt for Red October, whose pages are inhabited not only by Clancy's fictional cast but also by actual historical figures, such as Sergei Gorshkov, Dmitri Ustinov, and Yuri Padorin.  But Clancy blends two real-life Cold War episodes (the plot against the Pope and the defection of a KGB officer to the West) and tosses in at least some of the major players in the Ryan-verse.<br />Although far from perfect (there are references to the Falklands/Malvinas War of 1982, while the plot to kill John Paul II took place in 1981), Clancy proves he can still tell a compelling espionage/adventure story.  There is relatively little violence or gunplay here, a rarity in Clancy's work, since the focus here is on the extraction of the KGB defector and his small family from behind the Iron Curtain. This makes Red Rabbit a throwback to the classic espionage thriller of the John Le Carre mold, very much in the vein of Clancy's own The Cardinal of the Kremlin.  Even better, long time readers know (if they have read The Tom Clancy Companion) that the storyline about the KGB defector's extraction is probably based on a real story.

Stephen King's \\"Storm of the Century\\" screenplay is further proof, if anyone doubts it, that he's not only adept at writing a horror story that gives one the creeps, but that he is not limited to writing in one format.<br />Most novelists are content with sticking to one literary branch, letting other writers adapt their work to screenplay form.  Tom Clancy and John Grisham sell the film rights to producers such as Mace Neufeld and screenwriters (Donald Stewart and John Milius, for instance) rework their basic plots into adapted screenplays.  King, too, has allowed others to adapt his works for Hollywood, but he has also learned the demanding format of the screenplay and written quite a few (Creepshow, Silver Bullet, and The Stand, just to name a few).<br />For the ABC-TV miniseries \\"Storm of the Century,\\" King conjured up one of his darkest tales yet.  As a severe winter storm of unprecedented fury approaches Maine's Little Tall Island, Martha Clarendon is murdered in an unspeakably violent manner.  But instead of fleeing the scene of the crime as most killers do, Andre Linoge parks himself on his victim's easy chair and waits, his silver-wolf-head's cane in his hands, for the authorities to pick him up.<br />But with Linoge's arrest, Little Tall Island's woes do not end; they are only beginning.  For Linoge is one of those not-quite-human fiends Stephen King often creates to create havoc in small Maine communities like Little Tall Island, Derry, Jerusalem's Lot, and Castle Rock.  He can destroy people simply by revealing their darkest secrets and manipulating them from afar.  And by the time the Storm of the Century passes, the citizens of Little Tall Island will be horrified when they discover the meaning of Linoge's simple request: \\"Give me what I want, and I'll go away.\\"<br />The introduction to this published screenplay of  \\"Storm of the Century\\" allows King to explain why he sometimes writes original teleplays rather than starting by writing a novel then adapting it.  He also reveals why he sells his miniseries to a broadcast network with its stricter Standards and Practices staff  (censors) instead of the more liberal cable networks (HBO, Showtime), and much more.<br />I saw the original miniseries when it aired a few years back, and I am sure (okay, I know for a fact) that there is a DVD version of \\"Storm of the Century.\\"  This book reminded me of how effective the three-part \\"Novel for Television\\" was, and it is a fascinating read.ting it.

Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of The Lord of the Rings, continues the chronicles of the small folk known as Hobbits and their role in the War of the Ring.  Longer, more complicated, and far darker than The Hobbit (\\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings,\\" as Ballantine Books' marketing division puts it), this first installment of three places the destiny of Middle-Earth in the hands of a hobbit.<br />It's been over 50 years since Gandalf the Wizard and a party of 12 Dwarves enlisted Bilbo Baggins to serve as their \\"burglar\\" in their quest to recover the Dwarves' treasure hoard from the dragon Smaug, who terrorized the lands near the Lonely Mountain.  After facing trolls, giant spiders, and orcs (called goblins in The Hobbit), the survivors of that adventure returned home and went on with their lives....<br />But even though Bilbo Baggins returned to Hobbiton with a bit of treasure and a tale to set down on paper for future generations, he also brought back a dangerous piece of jewelry, a ring he had found in a cave during one of his misadventures as the \\"burglar.\\"  Plain and apparently ordinary, the ring had the ability to render its wearer invisible.  This power helped Bilbo escape from the ring's previous owner, the strange creature known as Gollum, and saved the hobbit and his friends from several sticky situations.<br />The Fellowship of the Ring's narrative begins with a long introduction that explains the book's connections to The Hobbit. Tolkien gives us more background information on hobbits, their history and traditions, and even a short treatise on pipeweed, the Middle-Earth version of tobacco.  After this explanatory preface, the narrative focuses on the next generation of hobbit adventurers, especially Bilbo's nephew and heir Frodo, his gardener and loyal friend Samwise Gamgee, and his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took.<br />Gandalf, the Wizard who'd enlisted Bilbo more than 50 years earlier, returns to serve as both mentor and protector for Frodo, and it is he who reveals to the younger Baggins the true nature of Bilbo's ring.  It is, as all Tolkien readers know, no ordinary magic ring, but a dangerous Ring of Power, forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron to control the other Rings of Power crafted by Elves he had deceived into making for him to rule over the three major races of Middle-Earth.  It's also Gandalf who enlists Frodo to go on a perilous quest to take the One Ring out of the Shire and to find a way to destroy it forever.<br />Tolkien's tale is entertaining and at the same time a challenging piece of literature. He uses different styles of writing to tell his tale, ranging from straightforward narrative prose to poems full of references to Middle-Earth mythology, some of which makes more sense after reading his posthumous work The Silmarillion. Some readers (especially younger ones) may feel overwhelmed by all the songs and epic saga-style poetry, but patience with this book is a virtue with its own reward. The Lord of the Rings is one of those rare fantasy tales that has stood the test of time, as proved by its enduring popularity and the popular and critical success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations.as both mentor and protector for Frodo, and it is he who reveals to the younger Baggins the true nature of Bilbo's ring.

Anytime a television series or movie franchise also becomes a publishing franchise, the question most fans ask themselves is: \\"Does this story fit into the so-and-so Universe, and if so, how?\\" Star Wars fans are always faced with this line of inquiry whenever a new book or comic book issue hits the bookshelves, and so are Star Trek fans. A writer (or group of writers) gets creative license by the franchise owners (Paramount/Viacom in this case) and has permission to play in someone else's universe.  As long as the novels don't stray too far from the established parameters of characters like Jim Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, or Mr. Spock, a Star Trek novel can be well-written and entertaining.  It can even (as Federation does) take established data points from the series and movies and create an exciting scenario for the \\"union\\" of the first two Star Trek series.  However, both the authors and the readers know that Star Trek's \\"official\\" storyline is confined to the TV shows (all 5 series) and the 10 feature films.<br />So even though Star Trek: First Contact \\"overruled\\" Federation's scenario of an unexpected encounter between the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) and its fourth namesake (NCC-1701D), intertwined with plot threads from The Original Series' episodes Requiem for Methuselah, Journey to Babel, and Metamorphosis, as well as TNG's Sarek.  Zefram Cochrane plays a central role in this multi-generational saga conceived as a \\"prequel\\" to Star Trek: Generations...and the Reeves-Stevens husband-and-wife team did a magnificent job of writing a wonderful \\"sequel\\" to Metamorphosis...knowing quite well, as their note to the reader explains, that their contribution to the Star Trek saga could be superseded by a movie in the future.<br />In spite of now being a non-canon Star Trek story, Federation is a well-written and entertaining novel. The authors capture the personalities of the Star Trek characters vividly, and their knowledge of the established Star Trek timelines and episodes give this work a sense of authenticity (if such a thing existed in a fictional universe) that only the best Trek writers can give to their books.<br />So, even if Federation strays from the \\"official\\" story, it's still a Star Trek novel worth reading.<br />Alex Diaz-Granadoses give this work a sense of authenticity (if such a thing existed in a fictional universe) that only the best Trek writers can give to their books. <br />So, even if Federation strays from the \\"official\\" story, it's still a Star Trek novel worth reading.<br />Alex Diaz-Granados	2003-10-15

Every saga, as the tag line for another series' first episode goes, has a beginning, and the same could be said for the crew of the Federation starship USS Enterprise.<br />When we first saw them on TV in the fall of 1966, the starship Enterprise, Capt. James T. Kirk commanding, was already well into its five-year mission.  The officers and crew had already been through several assignments and worked well as a team....and the exploits of Capt. Kirk and his starship were already reaching near-legendary status in the Federation.<br />But how did Kirk, one of the youngest men ever to attain the rank of Captain, become skipper of the already legendary starship? How did the crew come together to become the finest crew in Starfleet?<br />Vonda McIntyre (The Entropy Effect, the novelizations for Star Trek II-IV, plus the Star Wars novel The Crystal Star) delves into the unknown beginning of the Star Trek saga in her novel Enterprise: The First Adventure.<br />The novel begins as the newly promoted Captain James Tiberius Kirk, 28 years old and decorated hero -- he barely survived a disastrous mission at Ghioge -- is given his new assignment: command of the Constitution-class starship Enterprise. Her former skipper, Capt. Chris Pike, has been given a promotion to commodore, and Kirk has been chosen as his replacement.<br />Although Kirk is happy about his new rank and his first starship command, he is disappointed when his friend Gary Mitchell (still recovering from his wounds received at Ghioge) is not assigned to the Enterprise as his first officer. Instead, he inherits Pike's half-Vulcan science officer, Mr. Spock.  Kirk thinks Spock is too cold and analytical, while the logic-minded first officer believes the new captain might be too reckless for his own -- and the ship's -- good.  To make matters worse, Kirk's veteran chief engineer, Montgomery Scott, is not happy about Starfleet's decision to turn Enterprise over to an &quot;untried tyro.&quot;<br />The novel works best when it describes the uneasy first days of Kirk's command. It's interesting to know that it took a challenging &quot;first contact&quot; mission and a confrontation with a renegade Klingon captain to start molding the Enterprise crew into the team we saw on both the small and silver screens, not to mention all the novels and comic book series that continue to sell briskly nearly 40 years after Star Trek premiered on NBC-TV.<br />McIntyre is a good wordsmith and captures the spirit of the Star Trek characters vividly. She has a fondness for Sulu and gives his character more depth than he often was given by the series' scriptwriters.  Kirk, too, is very interesting in this novel; he exhibits a streak of rebelliousness that several years as captain will tame just a bit.  His relationship with Carol Marcus (who is the mother of his son David) and his mom and brother are also explored in some detail.<br />The mission itself and some of the other characters were a bit uninteresting, but Enterprise: The First Adventure still held my attention, even in some of the less exciting chapters.best when it describes the uneasy first days of Kirk's command.

Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire, first published in 1996, is the centerpiece of a Lucasfilm multi-media marketing campaign that could be summed up with the tag line &quot;Everything but the movie.&quot;  Not only was Perry assigned to write the novel, but Kenner (now Hasbro) rolled out a line of action figures, Dark Horse Comics published a multi-issue series, Nintendo released a console-based game for its Nintendo 64 system, and Joel McNeeley (The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles) composed an original score. In short, all that was missing was the feature film.<br />And what a film Shadows of the Empire would make! Although the novel is part of the Expanded Universe series that started with Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, it's the first of the 1990s-era novels to explore the six-month or so time span between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.<br />In this smartly-written, fast-paced novel, Lord Darth Vader and his evil master Emperor Palpatine still live and Han Solo is frozen in carbonite en route to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine.  On that desert planet, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa wait for word from Lando Calrissian and Han's Wookiee first mate Chewbacca that the bounty hunter Boba Fett has landed with his prized captive.  But Fett has taken a detour to repair his ship, the Slave I, and has been spotted on an Imperial-held world known as Gall.  Deciding it's worth the risk, and with the assistance of Rogue Squadron and a dashing and brash mercenary named Dash Rendar, Luke and his friends mount a rescue attempt.<br />Meanwhile, on the Imperial throne world Coruscant, Vader juggles his quest to find Luke Skywalker and at the same time contend with the machinations of Prince Xizor, a cunning crime lord and Vader's rival for the favor of their mutual overlord, Emperor Palpatine.  Xizor, a Falleen with great intellect, fighting prowess, and even greater ambition, seeks to usurp the former Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord.  His plan combines the elimination of Vader's son and the setting of a deadly trap for the Rebel Alliance.<br />Although the ending is, of course, pre-determined (the events that follow are chronicled in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi), Shadows of the Empire is an exciting and suspenseful book.  Vader fans particularly will enjoy this novel; we get glimpses into the Dark Lord's personality that the movies (and their novelizations) only barely hint at. Even better, Perry uses the films (particularly The Empire Strikes Back) as a gold mine of material.  The prologue, set inside the Imperial Palace, takes a short but crucial scene from Episode V and gives it new depth and meaning, even though Perry leaves the dialog intact.  In the rest of the novel, the author not only creates his own adventures for the Star Wars heroes and villains, but also &quot;sets the stage&quot; for the &quot;official story&quot; as seen in Episode VI.  (Indeed, other Lucasfilm-licensed or created projects incorporated Shadows of the Empire into their storyline.  In 1997's Special Edition re-release of A New Hope, Asp droids make an appearance, as does Dash Rendar's ship, the Outrider. And Brian Daley made several references to events from Shadows in his Return of the Jedi radio drama.)<br />Alex Diaz-Granadoselimination of Vader's son and the setting of a deadly trap for the Rebel Alliance.<br />Although the ending is, of course, pre-determined (the events that follow are chronicled in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi), Shadows of the Empire is an exciting and suspenseful book.

At the end of Dark Empire II, the evil Emperor Palpatine stood poised on the brink of victory over the New Republic.  Once more, his technical innovators have built a superweapon -- a Galaxy Gun that fires \\"intelligent\\" planet-killing missiles -- that threatens the former Rebel Alliance with total annihilation.  And once more, the familiar cast of heroes (Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and the rest of the Star Wars crew) must race to stop Palpatine once and for all.<br />For both sides, this is a conflict for all the marbles, you might say. For Palpatine, it's his final chance to retain flesh-and-blood life.  His once-large collection of clones has been destroyed by either Luke Skywalker or renegade Imperial court members, and the clone body he currently \\"lives in\\" is breaking down and becoming unstable.  His last hope is Han and Leia's newborn, named for his late grandfather Anakin.  If he can take over the child's body with his dark side essence, Palpatine can carry out his plan to take back the galaxy. By cloning his new body, he can also rule the Empire forever.<br />Of course, even the best of Palpatine's plans can be thwarted, and Tom Veitch and Jim Baikie leave no doubt as to which side will prevail in Empire's End.  By far the shortest of the three installments in the Dark Empire series, it is also very true to the Star Wars template....good triumphs over evil, there are some awesome space battles, and, of course, a climactic lightsaber duel.  The story's brevity (I believe the original comic series was only two issues long) is somewhat surprising, as is the change in look, since artist Jim Baikie's style is very different from Cam Kennedy's.	2003-10-14

The Second World War was the largest, bloodiest conflict in history.  It was fought on three of the seven continents and involved every major power of the time. Some of the combatant nations (most notably France and Italy) changed sides at least once between 1939 and 1945, and by the time Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945 over 50 million men, women, and children were dead, millions more were wounded and/or uprooted, homeless, and bewildered by the war's effects.  Indeed, those of us now living in the early 21st century are still living with the aftermath of World War II; many of the crises we now face can be traced to decisions made during or shortly after the war.<br />John Keegan's The Second World War is a one-volume general history of the 1939-45 conflict, and it should be read more as an introductory text rather than a comprehensive \\"this-is-the-book-that-explains-the-whole-darned-thing\\" opus.  It's too short (595 pages, not counting the bibliography or index) for that.  Instead, it is structured in six parts, starting with Hitler's early campaigns in Poland and the West in 1939-40 and culminating with Japan's surrender in midsummer of 1945.  Each part is divided into a few chapters that focus on themes and strategies...with attention given to a particular type of warfare in form of an example.  For instance, for \\"Air Battle,\\" Keegan cites the Battle of Britain.  For \\"Airborne Battle,\\" he uses Crete as his centerpiece.<br />The book is strongest when Keegan goes into detail about such things as the evolution of armies from the 19th century until the war starts in September 1939; he is particularly adept when explaining the revolutionary changes in European military organizations, particularly after the integration of the railroad and mass-production techniques from 1860 on.  Keegan takes a potential snore-inducing subject -- Surplus and war-making capacity, say -- and makes it interesting to the average reader.  His experience as an instructor at Sandhurst and his writing skills allow Keegan to weave a coherent narrative tapestry that depicts World War II in all its terrible yet mesmerizing spectacle.<br />As good as this book is, it is not without its flaws.  Perhaps his research assistants blundered on occasion, or the publisher's deadline loomed too near when Keegan completed The Second World War, but I spotted a few errors of fact or terminology. In Part V: The War in the West, Keegan writes this about Operation Market-Garden: \\"Market, the seizure of the bridges at Eindhoven and Nijmegen [in Holland] by the American airborne divisions, proved a brilliant success. Garden, the descent of the British 1st Airborne Division on the more distant Rhine bridges at Arnhem, did not.\\"  In fact, Market was the code name given to the entire airborne half of the operation, while Garden referred to the British ground force (XXX Corps) assigned to relieve and reinforce the paratroopers.  In another chapter, Keegan labels the SS mobile task forces used to round up and execute tens of thousands of Jews in the East with the term Sonderkommando.  This, too, is inaccurate.  The German SS units Keegan writes about were called Einsatzgruppen. Sonderkommandos were Jewish concentration camp inmates given the awful duties of emptying the gas chambers and crematoria in such hellish places as Auschwitz and Treblinka.  Obviously, few books ever escape the odd typo or small factual error, but there are enough of these gaffes to distract or confuse the reader.<br />Nevertheless, John Keegan's book is worth reading, flaws and all.nd his writing skills allow Keegan to weave a coherent narrative tapestry that depicts World War II in all its terrible yet mesmerizing spectacle.<br />As good as this book is, it is not without its flaws.

Although Red Storm Rising and Cardinal of the Kremlin are both Tom Clancy novels...and they both deal with the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the now defunct Soviet Union, they are very different in both theme and content. They are not even &quot;related,&quot; as Red Storm Rising is the only major Clancy novel that is not set in what fans call the Ryan-verse, while Cardinal of the Kremlin is the &quot;chronological sequel&quot; to The Hunt for Red October.<br />Red Storm Rising (1986), co-written with former naval intelligence officer/war-game designer Larry Bond (Red Phoenix), proved that Clancy's success with &quot;Red October&quot; was no fluke.  His huge and sweeping account of a conventional war between the Soviet Union/Warsaw Pact and the U.S./NATO forces in Western Europe was a runaway bestseller and, to this day, is still many a devoted Clancy fan's favorite novel.  Its depiction of a third Battle of the Atlantic and the description of mid-1980s weapons and tactics have also made Red Storm Rising required reading at various military academies.<br />Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988), Clancy's fourth novel, is the true sequel to Hunt for Red October. (Patriot Games, which preceded Cardinal by one year, is actually set before Hunt for Red October.) In this one, CIA analyst Jack Ryan must attempt the extraction of the Agency's top &quot;mole&quot; in Moscow, a man code-named CARDINAL. A traditional espionage thriller, it was also pretty topical 15 year ago, touching upon the Soviets' war in Afghanistan and the superpowers' race to develop a space-based anti-missile defense.<br />Even if (as I do) you own all the Clancy novels, you might still want this book, especially to take on a long vacation.	2003-10-10

Six years after the Battle of Endor, the destruction of the Empire's second Death Star, and the defeat of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the war for control of the galaxy still rages on.<br />Despite their victory over the infamous Grand Admiral Thrawn a year before, the former Rebels have been forced to evacuate Coruscant after a successful invasion by resurgent Imperial forces.  But when the Empire's \\"leaders\\" begin to fight over the right to govern, civil war breaks out and gives Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian and Alliance troops an opening to carry out a daring raid on Coruscant itself.  But the mission goes awry and Skywalker and Calrissian crash-land their captured Star Destroyer at the heart of the Imperial City.<br />But when Han Solo and his wife Leia, accompanied by Chewbacca and C-3PO, attempt to rescue Luke and Lando, they are taken aback by Luke's refusal to go with them back to the secret Alliance base known as Pinnacle. Instead, he allows himself to be whisked off by a dark side storm, leaving his twin sister and her husband to wonder if the burdens of being a Jedi Master are too heavy for Luke to bear alone.<br />When this new chapter of the Star Wars Expanded Universe was first published as a six-issue comic book series by Dark Horse, I had mixed feelings.  The concept was daring...Luke falls to the dark side of the Force (or does he?), the Emperor, thought to be dead at the end of Return of the Jedi, is back, thanks to the power of cloning technology...heck, even Boba Fett is revealed to having not being found \\"digestible\\" by the Sarlacc.  All very fascinating, but wasn't Tom Veitch pushing things a bit too far?  So even though I read my friend Geno's six issues from cover to cover, I thought, \\"Na[...] not buying this. It doesn't fit into the Star Wars saga....\\"<br />Ah. Silly me. When I read Kevin J. Anderson's Jedi Search, the first installment of the Jedi Academy Trilogy, I noticed certain references to the reconstruction of both Coruscant and Mon Calamari, which had been subjected to battle and siege in Dark Empire. There were also passing references to the reborn Emperor.  Later, when I broke down and bought this one volume collection, I read the introduction by Anderson and realized that the changes Veitch made in the Star Wars storyline were just too big to ignore.  Even though as a Star Wars fan I know the only \\"official\\" version is the six-Episode film saga as written, produced, and/or directed by George Lucas, I lightened up and came to accept Dark Empire and its two sequels as an integral -- and fun -- part of the Expanded Universe.<br />The story by Veitch (once you get over the \\"how dare he?\\" reaction to it) is so well-written that you wish it had been a pure prose novel.

Blumenson states point-blank that had Eisenhower, Bradley, and Montgomery paid more attention to the immediate goal of destroying the German army in Normandy instead of being diverted by visions of a triumphal march into Germany, a large number of German troops and their equipment would have been sealed in a huge pocket and the war could have ended in 1944.<br />Instead, American, British, and Canadian generals, with the exception of George Patton, opted to stick to the Overlord plan, often passing up promising tactical opportunities and, as Blumenson often says, playing it safe.<br />I found this book interesting in its even-handed approach of not going the &quot;it was all Monty's fault,&quot; though that British commander's flaws as an army group leader are pointed out.  Bradley and Eisenhower don't escape Blumenson's critical gaze; indeed, it was Bradley's desire to keep the more dashing Patton on a short leash that the author says was a critical factor for the Germans' last minute escape from a potentially disastrous double envelopment.  Monty and the British high command, of course, get a fair share of the criticism, including the prickly personality quirks of the 21st Army Group's commander and his penchant for wanting a &quot;tidy&quot; battlefield.<br />As the title implies, The Battle of the Generals deals more with high-level strategy rather than the more compelling &quot;you-are-there&quot; eyewitness-accounts in the style of Cornelius Ryan's The Longest Day or Stephen Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers.  Students of military history may find this book fascinating, but readers seeking a more involving human-interest book may be disappointed.quot; eyewitness-accounts in the style of Cornelius Ryan's The Longest Day or Stephen Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers.

When the resulting Russo-American investigation points to Chinese operatives who want to weaken Russia's intelligence services, everyone starts wondering: why?  And when the pieces of the puzzle start falling in place, American and Russian forces scramble to defend Siberia and its natural resources from an act of naked aggression by the People's Republic of China.<br />Tom Clancy's tenth novel, The Bear and Dragon, returns to the arena of large-scale conventional warfare. While at times Clancy's conservative agenda becomes grating, as a piece of speculative fiction it works.<br />The Bear and the Dragon also ties up some leftover narrative threads from Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, and Rainbow Six.  The &quot;heavy&quot; is that mysterious Chinese minister, Zhang Han Sen, who was a shadowy force behind America's war with Japan and the subsequent Persian Gulf war between the U.S. and the United Islamic Republic.

Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy's 10th novel and ninth in the Jack Ryan/John Clark series, once more focuses on the ex-CIA paramilitary field officer known in the Agency as Mr. Clark. This time, the focus once again turns to the challenges of fighting global terrorists and the menace from extremists determined not only to reshape society, but the entire planet's environment.<br />Clark is close to retiring as a paramilitary officer in the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Operations when Agency executive directors Ed and Mary Pat Foley, with the tacit approval of the recently elected President John Patrick Ryan, ask him to run an elite team of antiterrorist Special Ops fighters from several NATO countries.  Their mission: to act as an international 911 team in hostage and other terror-related situations deemed too high-risk for local law-enforcement agencies. Based in England, this so-called Rainbow Team will be deployed mainly in Europe, but with support from U.S. and other allied nations, can operate anywhere in the world.  Clark, who was an enlisted member of a SEAL team in Vietnam, is given a rank equivalent to a full colonel and the call sign Rainbow Six. (In military parlance, the designator \\"six\\" after a unit's call sign is assigned to a commanding officer.)<br />Rainbow Six opens with a tense incident high above the Atlantic as a small group of Basque terrorists attempts to hijack the plane carrying Clark, his wife, his protege and new son-in-law Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, and Alistair Stanley, his British second in command, to London.  Using their wits and finely honed skills, the three Rainbow members overwhelm the hijackers and save the crew and their fellow passengers.<br />With this introduction to the job, Clark then turns his attention to training the various members of the several Rainbow teams, not knowing that the airliner incident was simply one of many terrorist incidents being bankrolled by a mysterious and wealthy individual with a darker, more terrifying agenda.  With the assistance of a former KGB officer and inspired by one of the most horrible aspects of the Iranian plot against the U.S. (as chronicled in Executive Orders), a group of environmental extremists is plotting to reverse centuries of man-made damage to the Earth's biosphere by committing the most horrible act of mass murder in history.<br />Clancy's novel paints a troubling picture of what happens when a noble idea (such as promoting global conservation) is twisted and perverted by charismatic and cold-blooded individuals, and its action-oriented plot inspired an ongoing series of computer games.terrifying agenda.

In the horrific climax of Debt of Honor, former intelligence official and National Security Advisor (and briefly, Vice-President) Jack Ryan finds himself elevated to the Presidency...and in the sights of foreign and domestic adversaries. Even as the Capitol building smolders and the late President Roger Durling is laid to rest, unfriendly eyes are watching the new and untried President Ryan for signs of weakness...and begin plotting his -- and America's -- downfall.<br />In Iran, Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei (one of the opponents of the Fowler Peace Plan in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;) broods in his office and begins to set in motion a series of crises that will tie up America's already over-extended military and intelligence services. Daryaei enlists not only his own operatives in Iran and abroad, but also the leaders of two other nations with global ambitions of their own.  By creating a series of seemingly unrelated crises all at once, including an Iranian &quot;merger&quot; with Iraq and renewed tensions between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, Daryaei hopes to distract American attention and pave the way for a savage attack on both President Ryan and millions of American citizens.<br />But Ryan has made many enemies at home, too, including the former Vice-President, Edward Kealty, who had been forced to resign in the wake of a personal scandal.  With the skills and connections he has made during his many years in Washington, Kealty begins a campaign to remove the still-untried Ryan from the Presidency.<br />Clancy's huge novel is both compelling and complex, taking the reader from the ruins of the Capitol to the jungles of Africa and into the crowded streets of Tehran as President Ryan begins the awesome task of rebuilding a government decimated by a terrible act of revenge...and facing a loose confederacy of enemies bent on destroying his country, his family, and his life.	2003-10-04

The United States Marine Corps, as best-selling author Tom Clancy explains in the fourth entry in the Guided Tour series, is America's most hallowed armed service.  Marine: A Guided Tour of a Marine Expeditionary Unit, is an in-depth look at a Marine Expeditionary Unit - Special Operations Capable, a 2,000-strong assault force equipped with armor, artillery and a small but powerful air support detachment that is capable of executing many types of military operations.<br />Currently, seven MEU(SOC)s are in active service; three each on each coast, plus one in Okinawa with the Third Marine Division.  Each unit can carry out almost any type of operation, ranging from short-duration raids on an enemy shore to providing humanitarian assistance after a natural or man-made disaster. Clancy describes the tools and weapons used by the men and women of a MEU(SOC), the amphibious ships of the Navy (the Corps' parent service) as well as the history and doctrine of the United States Marines. There is an interview with the 31st Commandant of the Marines, as well as a fictional depiction of how a MEU(SOC) might be employed in a future combat.	2003-10-04

A few months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Larry Bond and Patrick Larkin's first collaborative effort, Red Phoenix, became a New York Times bestselling novel.<br /><br />In this novel, Bond (Tom Clancy's uncredited co-author of Red Storm Rising) uses his superb writing skills, experience as a former Navy intelligence expert and talents as a war game designer (he is the creator of Harpoon) to write a terrifying scenario for a second and even more destructive Korean War.<br /><br />Red Phoenix is set in the early 1990s. North Korea's elderly Great Leader, Kim Il-Sung, is still alive but clearly frail. Day to day control of this isolated and paranoid Stalinist nation is now in the hands of Kim's ambitious son, Kim Jong-Il, the Dear Leader.  Ruthless and mercurial, the younger Kim seeks to surpass his father and accomplish what the old man had failed to do in the 1950s: the reunification of the Communist North and the capitalist South.<br /><br />At first, Kim's plans almost become undone when a team of South Korean and American soldiers discovers a tunnel dug under the DMZ by North Korean combat engineers. In it is a vast stockpile of weapons, ammunition, and even Soviet-made tanks, enough for a battalion of invaders. But events elsewhere, including the office of a Michigan Congressman and the Interior Ministry in Seoul, soon create a perfect convergence of events that enables North Korea's nefarious Dear Leader to mobilize his forces and launch a lightning invasion of South Korea.<br /><br />Bond and Larkin's novel depicts units, weapons systems, and tactics which were state-of-the-art 14 years ago, and the political makeup of the world has changed since its publication. (Modern day readers might see as archaic Bond's references to the Soviet Union, East Germany, and other Warsaw Pact nations. In early 1989, these may have sided with North Korea, at least nominally.  Today, of course, the USSR is no more, East Germany reunited with West Germany and is part of NATO, as is Poland.)  However, considering the current and alarming situation as the real Kim Jong-Il races to build and openly deploy nuclear weapons, Red Phoenix is no longer a relic of Cold War-era popular fiction; it is a chilling vision of what a conventional conflict in the Korean Peninsula could have been like before North Korea upped the ante and developed weapons of mass destruction.TO, as is Poland.)

Debt of Honor, Tom Clancy's eighth novel (and seventh in the Jack Ryan series) brings the former CIA Deputy Director out of a brief retirement and back into government service.  With the dust settling from the various crises depicted in The Sum of All Fears, Jack Ryan joins the two-year-old Durling Administration as a replacement for an inadequate National Security Adviser.  Although he has been making money on Wall Street and thinking of becoming a teacher again, Ryan has missed serving his country and is restless and feeling unfulfilled. So when ex-President Robert Fowler's successor asks him to work in the West Wing to reinvigorate his floundering defense and foreign policy, the stalwart Ryan accepts what he thinks will be his last government post.<br />Just in the nick of time, too.  Across the Pacific Ocean, Japanese industrialist Raizo Yamata and a small but powerful group of business and military leaders is planning the unthinkable: a surprise attack against the American financial nerve center, coinciding with a conventional assault against the shrinking U.S. military presence in the Pacific.  Even worse, Yamata and his confederates in and out of the Japanese government have secretly built a small but deadly stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.<br />Yamata is motivated by a debt of honor he believes he owes to his family, decimated in 1944 when American forces landed on the island of Saipan.  He harbors great hatred for the &quot;gaijin&quot; who wrested the Mariana Islands from Japan and made his parents and siblings jump off &quot;Banzai Cliff&quot; rather than face the disgrace of being captured by the American Marines and soldiers. Now, at the zenith of his financial power, Yamata has assembled a group of like-minded industrialists, politicians, and even military officers to cripple the U.S. and reclaim Japan's rightful place as a true global power.<br />Clancy masterfully tells a complex yet compelling story of an unexpected conflict between two technologically advanced nations, while explaining in detail the psychology of economics, the bizarre nature of diplomacy and its scripted niceties, the nature of wars of aggression (Ryan classifies such wars as &quot;armed robbery writ large&quot;), and the corrosive effect of the revenge motive on nations and individuals.<br />As in most of the Ryan novels, new characters (Chet Nomura, Raizo Yamata, Zhang Han Sen and George Winston) are introduced even as readers catch up with familiar Clancy players (Robby Jackson, Ed and Mary Pat Foley, John Clark, and Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez).

Bill Slavicsek was luckier a decade later; the Expanded Universe had grown a bit larger with the new wave of Star Wars-related novels, role-playing game guides, graphic novels, and even young readers' books.<br />But even though Slavicsek's 1994 and 2000 Guides are very well-done, Steven J. Sansweet's huge Star Wars Encyclopedia is a treasure trove of information about the Star Wars saga's details. Following the same format as the Slavicsek &quot;Guides,&quot; Sansweet's large and lavishly illustrated one-volume Encyclopedia covers every imaginable topic from the Rebel A-Wing to the Imperial officer known as Zuggs.<br />Because it was published in 1998, precious little information from the current &quot;Prequel Trilogy&quot; appears in this edition of The Star Wars Encyclopedia. Also, the Expanded Universe has gotten larger, so readers who want to find out about topics covered in the New Jedi Order series will be disappointed. Fans will have to wait until 2006 to see the second, updated edition.<br />Still, Sansweet's book is considered to be the best reference work, not only for its thoroughness, but because the author is a vice president at Lucasfilm and is the owner of one of the world's largest private Star Wars collections.

From July to October 1940, Nazi Germany's vaunted Luftwaffe attempted to achieve air supremacy over Britain and pave the way for Operation Sea Lion, a seaborne invasion by Hitler's powerful land forces.  But a few thousand British and Commonwealth pilots, along with a few Americans and representatives of other Allied nations such as Poland and Czechoslovakia flew in their Hurricanes, Defiants, and Spitfires from their bases in the United Kingdom and inflicted enough damage on the German air fleets that Hitler and Goering had to call it a day and Operation Sea Lion never took place.<br />While it may not be unbiased nor the \\"definitive\\" work on the subject, The Battle of Britain is still very informative, particularly when dealing with the prewar preparations of Britain's air defenses and the birth of the German Luftwaffe.  Maybe, as one reviewer says, someone will write the ultimate book on this incredibly fascinating battle.

The third book in The Guided Tour series, Fighter Wing is a non-fiction book devoted to an Air Force Composite Wing. (Why it's called &quot;Fighter Wing&quot; escapes me, since the 366th Wing includes a wide range of combat aircraft!)  Like the other books in this seven-volume series, Fighter Wing gives the readers a reasonably interesting look at the U.S. Air Force since its restructuring in the early 1990s.  Here, for instance, is where I found out the Air Force had renamed its major commands; Strategic Air Command (which controlled the bombers, particularly the B-1, B-2, FB-111, and B-52 aircraft) and Tactical Air Command (which controlled the smaller fighters and fighter-bombers) merged and became Air Combat Command.<br />The book discusses the theory and history of air power, the training of the men and women who fly for the Air Force, and, of course, the planes and weapons of a typical Composite Wing.  As in most of the books in the Guided Tour series, photographs, graphics, an interview with a senior flag officer, and a fictional scenario depicting the combat roles of a Composite Wing are included.<br />The book is informative without getting too technical, and one comes away with a bit more inside information about how the modern Air Force works.	2003-09-29

Oh, the Klingons were interesting heavies, particularly in the feature films.  The Borg had their moments, but their toneless &quot;Resistance is futile&quot; compares palely to Khan's word duels with James T. Kirk in both the 1967 Original Series episode &quot;Space Seed&quot; and the 1982 feature film, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Of course, credit must go to Ricardo Montalban, whose wonderful voice and acting skills made Khan one of Kirk's most dangerous adversaries.<br />Noted Star Trek author Greg Cox's mu;ti-volume series, The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh is a clever and fascinating Star Trek &quot;historical&quot; novel which not only &quot;fills in the blanks&quot; about Khan and his fellow genetically engineered &quot;supermen,&quot; but also tries to reconcile actual historical events with the established Star Trek timeline.<br />Cox begins Volume One in the 23rd century, during Capt. James T. Kirk's first five-year mission. Assigned to investigate a colony of genetically engineered humans, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are still mindful about their recent run-in with Khan.  While en route to this Paragon Colony, Kirk decides to study the history of Khan and the Eugenics Wars of the late 20th Century.<br />Star Trek &quot;history&quot; tells us that in the 1990s, a group of some 90 genetically engineered men and women took over vast regions of Earth and waged a bloody series of conflicts that became known as the Eugenics Wars. One of the foremost of these &quot;supermen&quot; was Khan, who at the height of his power ruled one-fourth of the planet Earth.  By 1996, however, Khan and 80 of his followers fled Earth aboard the spacecraft SS Botany Bay, where they slept in suspended animation until the year 2267, when the USS Enterprise encountered the derelict vessel and Khan was revived.<br />Cox's challenge as a 21st Century writer was to mesh this fictional history with such real-life events as India's first nuclear test in 1974, the Bhopal accident and Indira Gandhi's assasination in 1984, the Reagan-Gorbachev Iceland Summit in 1986, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, among others.

Gresham, Submarine is an interesting look at one of the most fascinating yet least seen warships in the United States Navy, the Improved Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine.  While steering clear of revealing such closely guarded secrets as true maximum speed, diving depth, and the layout of the nuclear power plant, Clancy and Gresham manage to give the reader an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at &quot;the boat,&quot; its weapons, and more importantly, its officers and crew.  For, as Clancy has often pointed out in both his novels and op-ed columns, it's not the machine or weapon that determines success in battle; it's the operator and his/her training and morale that matter on the battlefield.<br />Supplementing the section on USS Miami -- the boat Clancy and Gresham closely examine --  is a section devoted to the Royal Navy's smaller but still-impressive nuclear sub force.  Clancy examines not only the workings and weapons of HMS Triumph, a Trafalgar-class attack sub, but he also delves into the differences in training between American and British SSN skippers.  His comments may raise eyebrows among some American readers unaccustomed to even constructive criticism of the U.S. Navy, but at least Clancy is honest and doesn't shy away from speaking his mind about a branch of our military that he is otherwise very fond of.<br />The new edition leaves the original text as it appeared in 1993: there are no updates on the featured officers (namely, the skippers and execs of USS Miami and HMS Triumph) and their subsequent careers.  However, Submarine does have a new section covering the entry into service of two new classes of SSN into Navy service, and the section on Other People's Boats has also been updated.<br />A word about the quality of this book. I like it enough to have both editions, true. It's informative (up to a point), but it's not exactly impressive, either.  As an introduction to the topic of nuclear attack subs, it works.

Tom Clancy has created several fictional heroes that are at the heart of his many novels. One, of course, is John Patrick Ryan, who has served his country as a Marine, CIA officer, National Security Adviser, and President of the United States.  With the exception of Red Storm Rising (a book that is not set in Clancy's &quot;Ryan-verse&quot;), Jack Ryan appears or is talked about in every novel from The Hunt for Red October to The Teeth of the Tiger.<br />The other major character Clancy readers have come to admire is John Clark, a man who works for the other side of the Agency as a paramilitary officer.  Whether he is in Colombia using a laser target designator to help bomb a Medellin Cartel member's mansion or leading a multinational antiterrorist team called Rainbow, Clark is the type of man our government needs to use while denying his existence.<br />But John Clark has a past wrapped in mystery, one his family doesn't know much about and is a closely guarded secret.  For John Clark was once ex-SEAL John T. Kelly, Vietnam veteran, avid diver and sailor.<br />But when Kelly's girlfriend is brutally murdered by a Baltimore drug lord's henchmen, the otherwise peacable and war-weary Kelly vows revenge. Dispensing his own version of street justice relentlessly and without remorse, Kelly must not only avoid being killed by the drug dealers, but he also has to evade the dogged detective work of Baltimore cop Emmett Ryan, a World War II vet and father of the future President.<br />Adding to his already complicated life, Admiral James Greer recruits Kelly to participate in a daring rescue mission into North Vietnam.  But when a radicalized American antiwar activist gets wind of this secret military operation, events will drive John Terence Kelly down a path that he never intended to take.<br />Although published 11 years after The Hunt for Red October, this taut and thrilling novel is the first chapter of the long-running Jack Ryan saga.

Like the other six books in the Guided Tour series, Tom Clancy and John D. Gresham take the reader on a behind-the-scenes field trip of a military unit.  This time, the focus is on an Army armored cavalry regiment, its equipment and personnel, the history of armored cavalry, and two short fictional scenarios depicting the use of this type of unit in combat.<br />The one new feature (later included in all the later books) is a softball interview with now-retired General Fred Franks, former commander of the VII Corps during Desert Storm and later commander of TRADOC, Training and Doctrine Commmand.  Although informative, Armored Cav is more of a love letter to the Army than an unbiased piece of reporting. Still, fans of Clancy and of military hardware should not pass this book (or any of this series)up. Just park high expectations at the roadside and you'll enjoy this for what it is, and not what it could have been.	2003-09-26

In his sixth novel (and fifth entry in the Jack Ryan series), The Sum of All Fears, Tom Clancy once again turned his attention on the specter of global terrorism and meshed it to the themes of the limits of Presidential power, the sometimes nasty backbiting that goes on in the world of politics, and the ever-present danger from weapons of mass destruction.<br />The book opens with a prologue set during the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Egypt, Syria, and even a few Iraqi units attacked Israel in a stunning surprise attack.  Faced with possible defeat for the first time in 25 years, Israel alerts its small nuclear deterrent to be placed on standby.  In the confusion of increased mission tempo, a single small nuclear bomb is loaded onto an A-4 Skyhawk attack bomber whose pilot has no clue what he is carrying.  In an attack on a Syrian SAM battery, this A-4 is shot down and its deadly cargo falls into a Druze farmer's rocky field, where it will lie undisturbed for almost two decades.<br />Fast forward to Clancy's fictional mid 1990s-era world. The Cold War is ending, and the easing tensions between East and West offer the weary world both hope and fear.  With America and the Soviet Union now working together to solve some of the thorniest problems on the planet, expectations are high for a new, peaceful world order.<br />First and foremost of these problems, of course, is the Middle East, where Israeli-Palestinian relations have once again heated up in a chain of religiously-motivated incidents.  This time, though, the Palestinians have taken a cue from the American civil rights movement and started a Martin Luther King, Jr.-style \\"peaceful confrontation\\" campaign, which places Israel on the moral defensive.  Yet, a chance remark by Jack Ryan to a senior White House official begins a promising process that might lead to a fair solution to the long conflict between Muslims and Jews<br />The down side to all this is that not everyone is overjoyed with the wave of good news washing over the world. In Eastern Europe, die-hard Marxists refuse to accept the end of communism and rail against the \\"betrayal\\" by their former \\"socialist comrades\\" in the Soviet government.  Among these deluded die-hards is German terrorist Gunther Bock, a vengeful radical whose wife is now behind bars in Germany and his twin children put up for adoption.  On the run and lusting for the ultimate payback on the world, Bock will journey to the Middle East, where he will make contact with Palestinians sponsored by a shadowy Islamic leader who is equally unhappy about the coming peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.  And when by sheer luck this group (which will be joined by the unstable Native American Marvin Russell) comes across Israel's missing nuke, the ultimate revenge plot will begin to take form.<br />In this huge and complex novel, Jack Ryan is pushed to his limits both professionally and personally. For although the stalwart CIA analyst has now stepped up in rank to the post of acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, he is not held in the highest regard by the new Fowler Administration, which ironically won its place at the White House in part due to Ryan's actions at the end of Clear and Present Danger.  The new Director of Central Intelligence, Sebastian Cabot, is merely a pawn cleverly manipulated by the \\"power behind the throne\\" in the West Wing, and the President himself, Robert Fowler, is more interested in securing his ultra-liberal domestic agenda at the expense of a strong and consistent foreign/defense policy.<br />To make matters worse, Ryan has earned the personal enmity of Dr. Elizabeth Elliott, President Fowler's new National Security Adviser, who not only wants the acting DDCI to be fired from his CIA job, but wants to wreak havoc on his personal life.<br />When all these plot threads converge and a deadly crisis arises, it is Ryan who must act quickly to avert an even worse conflict that could be the product of the sum of everyone's fears.everyone's fears.	2003-09-25

The late Alex Comfort's almost poetic prose, ably aided by Clare Park's beautiful photography and Christopher Foss' now nearly-legendary color ilustrations, helps readers expand their sexual awareness and enhance their bedroom \\"playtime\\" to make their sex, well, more joyful.<br />While some people might be put off by Comfort's sometimes eclectic musings on various sexual practices, or even take issue with his statememts on bisexuality, this book should be in every couple's private library. This expanded edition was updated for the 1990s, and although much of the original 1970s edition's text was left unchanged, Comfort had to rethink some of his ideas about multiple partners as a result of the AIDS epidemic, something that all of us should still pay attention to.<br />Despite some use of erudite \\"History of Sex\\" material cited by other reviewers, Comfort didn't lapse into overly clinical language, using colloquialisms for male and female genitalia instead of their medical names. Comfort, after all, wasn't writing for doctors in a dry academic tome; he was writing to the rest of us, using words and phrases that we are comfortable using within the confines of our bedrooms.<br />There are, of course, other \\"cookbooks\\" with recipes for great sex, but Comfort's classic was, and still is, among the best of them.	2003-09-23

It also explores such notions as the rule of law, the proper application of military force, the niceties of international law, and the need for good men to stand up for their beliefs, even if it means standing up to the President of the United States.<br />Clear and Present Danger is a very complex work. It starts with the interception of a drug-carrying yacht whose rightful owners have been murdered viciously by two Colombian \\"sicarios\\" employed by the Medellin Cartel. From this seemingly routine event, a chain of escalating events culminating with the Cartel's bold attack on three American envoys in Bogota (Colombia's capital)leads to a Presidential decision that will have dire consequences both at home and abroad.<br />Here, too, Jack Ryan must face the pitfalls of his ascent up the ladder at Langley. His mentor and surrogate father, Admiral James Greer, is suffering from cancer and Ryan must step into his post, not knowing that the President's new and shifty National Security Adviser, Adm. James Cutter, has dragooned the Directorate of Operations and CIA Director Arthur \\"Judge\\" Moore into carrying out a covert and illegal scheme to combat the drug cartels using military assets and the talents of CIA paramilitary operative John Clark.  By the conclusion of this novel, Ryan, too, will be caught in the tangled web of Cutter's scheme, and the repercussions of the \\"Colombian Affair\\" in both Ryan's professional and personal lives will linger on in later novels of this series.	2003-09-23

Had it ended with a dramatic confrontation with either the Romulans or Klingons...with Enterprise limping home scarred yet proud?  Why did Jim Kirk accept promotion to the Admiralty? Why did Mr. Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy leave Starfleet?<br />At least some of the major questions posed above were answered in 1989 when J.M. Dillard's Star Trek: The Lost Years was first published. With superb writing and storytelling skills, Dillard (perhaps now best known for writing all the novelizations of the latter half of the Star Trek feature films) paints a materpiece of Star Trek lore, blending the untold story of the breakup of the most famous crew in Starfleet with a tale of an ancient Vulcan mind-lord's revenge upon the &quot;weak followers of Surak,&quot; the Vulcans who chose to follow the path of logic and non-violence after centuries of war.<br />The Lost Years (which was the first of a four book series set in the two and a half year period between Enterprise's return to Earth and the events of Star Trek: The Motion Picture) captures the essence of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest of the crew so well, you can almost see and hear the original cast members acting out their most famous roles as you read this wonderfully crafted novel.	2003-09-22

Ambrose's best-selling D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, I was amazed by the late author's unabashed admiration for the soldiers who served in Europe and fought against Hitler's forces.  So when I heard about Citizen Soldiers, naturally I had to read it.<br /><br />Citizen Soldiers picks up the narrative of the last 11 months of World War II in Europe on June 7, 1944 (D+1) and takes the reader along on a fascinating battlefield tour of Northwest Europe. Ambrose, of course, covers all the major campaigns (Normandy, the race to the Rhine, the Battle of the Bulge, and the Battle for Germany), but he takes the time to explore little-talked about topics, such as the Hurtgen Forest debacle, the Army's lousy repple-depples, glimpses into the daily lives of the GIs, and the effect of racism in the pre-integrated Army.<br /><br />Athough Ambrose's main focus is the American \\"citizen soldier,\\" more space is devoted to German veterans and their recollections of the battles fought between June 7, 1944 and May 7, 1945.	2003-09-21

When I was a teenager, I bought the Lord of the Rings boxed set -- which included The Hobbit -- and attempted to read the whole Tolkien saga over the summer.  My intentions were good, but both the scope of the quest and the tiny type on the standard sized paperback defeated me.  I did not so much \\"read\\" The Lord of the Rings as \\"skimmed\\" through it.  Even though I got the gist of Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring and was astounded by the narrative of the War of the Ring, I could never say with a straight face that I had read The Lord of the Rings completely.<br />That is, until I found this one-volume edition in a trade paperback format. Even though I still had to fight off the temptation to skip through the various poems, songs and other embellishments Tolkien added to the basic \\"Gandalf-enlists-the-reluctant-but-brave-Hobbit-to-go-on-a-great-Quest\\" plot, at least with a more eye-friendly page/typeface size I could read The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King in their entirety and in a single book (which, as I found out last year, was Tolkien's intent; it was his British publisher who, for business reasons, divided the gigantic novel in three).<br />Considering the cost of books these days, this one-volume edition is quite a bargain!	2003-09-21

And if you read this seminal three-book cycle, you'll see why, even though novels published later (such as Shadows of the Empire or Tatooine Ghost) go backwards in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; timeline.<br />Here, of course, all the plot threads started in the previous two novels are wrapped up, though some of them will continue to develop in other Star Wars novels. As in the movie series that inspired it, there are space battles and lightsaber duels galore, and the mixture of adventure, romance, and drama that made Star Wars such a popular movie series is vividly recreated in Zahn's crisp and lively writing.	2003-09-20

Even though Darth Vader and the Emperor are dead and the galaxy-spanning Empire reduced to a quarter of its original size, a new Imperial warlord has returned from the Unknown Territories and rallied the cream of the Imperial fleet to mount a savage attack on the still-struggling New Republic.<br />Aided by the insane clone of a long-dead Jedi Master, the tactical genius Grand Admiral Thrawn has discovered the means to clone Imperial troopers, crewers, and pilots to replenish the once-depleted forces of the Empire. Now he searches for the Dark Force, the near-mythical Katana Fleet of ancient but still powerful dreadnaughts lost in a bizarre incident in the days before the Empire. Once in Imperial hands, this massive fleet will help Thrawn and his forces to regain control of the galaxy.<br />But all hope is not lost to the former Rebel Alliance.  Luke, Leia (who is pregnant with Jedi twins), Han, Chewie, and the droids are now being aided by the mysterious smuggler chief Talon Karrde and his protege Mara Jade.

With its depiction of the continuing battle between what is left of the Galactic Empire and the fledgling New Republic, this novel cleverly mixes the characters from the Classic Trilogy with a cast of newly created heroes and villains, some of whom will make appearances in other authors' Star Wars works.<br />As Heir to the Empire begins, the New Republic has been engaged in a long campaign to mop up the remnants of the once-mighty Empire.  The once dreaded Imperial Fleet is in disarray, political and military control of the late Emperor Palpatine's New Order has changed hands several times, yet the former Rebels have reduced Imperial dominion to one quarter of its former size. Yet even as Mon Mothma and the New Republic government establish democratic rule from Coruscant (former capital of both the Old Republic and the Galactic Empire), a new dark force has arisen in the form of one of the Empire's most cunning warriors.<br />His name is Thrawn, and his tactical and intellectual gifts are so great that the racist and sexist Palpatine had promoted him to be the only non-human to wear the white uniform of Grand Admiral.  For several years after the Battle of Endor (where the Rebels destroyed the second Death Star and both the Emperor and Darth Vader died), Thrawn was pacifying the Unknown Regions until his return to Imperial territory.  Now, with a small but powerful Imperial fleet at his command, the mysterious Grand Admiral believes he holds the key to the undoing of the New Republic and the restoration of the Empire.<br />Zahn not only introduced a set of new characters that would become essential to what fans know as the Expanded Universe series (the charming smuggler-chief Talon Karrde, the beautiful but mysterious Mara Jade, the devoted Imperial fleet captain Pelleaon, and the mad clone Joruus C'baoth), but he brought fans of the movie heroes up to date on the lives of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa Solo, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and the droids.<br />A professional reviewer, at the time of the book's first appearance in 1991, wrote that Heir to the Empire \\"captures the spirit of the movie trilogy so well, you can almost hear John Williams' soundtrack.\\"  Indeed, Zahn does a superb job rendering the personalities from George Lucas' films that one can almost hear Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, and Anthony Daniels when reading their characters' dialogue.

Yes, there are many such books out there (Anne Hooper seems to have made a good career for herself with her own series of &quot;how-to&quot; guides!), but the late Alex Comfort's The New Joy of Sex is by far the best.<br />Updating his 1972 bestseller for the 1990s as a result of the AIDS crisis, Comfort supplements his always helpful advice from the 1970s edition with new sections in which he discusses safe sex, the importance of sharing and respecting a partner's needs or fantasies.  Even better, Comfort uses language that is both informative and pleasing to the ear.  He also avoids being overly clinical; knowing how most people talk about sex, he doesn't shy away from using colloquial [phrases] when referring to genitalia.  Best of all, Comfort advises his audience that sex is something very human and essential to any meaningful relationship, so it should indeed be a source of joy.<br />Beautifully illustrated throughout with photos by Clare Park and drawings by John Raynes, The New Joy of Sex should be read at least once by any couple seeking to enhance their relationship.	2003-09-16

I have about two-thirds of his literary output, and if books were not as expensive now I'd still be a regular reader of King's works.<br />One of my favorite books by Steve-o is Skeleton Crew, his second collection of short stories, including the novella &quot;The Mist.&quot; And as in any collection of short fiction, some of the 22 stories stand head and shoulders above the rest.<br />The creepiest, by far, is &quot;The Mist,&quot; which begins with, as in all good King works, with a seemingly normal event (a storm) and a routine occurrence (a trip to the supermarket) and slowly but surely morphs into a situation which becomes scarier as the story progresses. While not wanting to give anything away, I can tell you this much -- I'll never go to the Kash n' Karry and look at it quite the same way again, particularly in the spaghetti sauce section.<br />&quot;Survivor Type&quot; is King's take on Robinson Crusoe. Its protagonist is Richard Pine, a surgeon who, unfortunately, has also been involved in the narcotics &quot;business.&quot;  Now, after he is shipwrecked and marooned on a desert isle, Pine is forced to face his inner demons and, by the way, cope with the problem of what to eat in a place where there is no viable food source.  Suffice it to say that in his desperation he will have to use his surgical training to solve this dicey problem.<br />While there are other stories that give me the willies, I am always drawn to &quot;Word Processor of the Gods.&quot;  I first read it before I ever owned -- or even used -- a personal computer, and its premise involving a word processor with supernatural powers, while silly on the surface, was very compelling to me as an aspiring writer. King asks: What if you simply typed a sentence like &quot;I wish I were married to the loveliest, kindest person on earth,&quot; and by pressing ENTER, it came true?  Maybe in the hands of a lesser writer the premise is silly, but King tells his story with a fine balance of spookiness and wit. The closing paragraph is a gem.<br />The beauty of an anthology like Skeleton Crew is that you can read as much or as little of it as you like, choosing whatever story strikes your fancy at any given moment.  If you are a newcomer to King's storytelling and don't want to commit yourself to a major novel such as IT or The Stand, this is a fine place to start.erson on earth,&quot; and by pressing ENTER, it came true?

The book depicts Co. E's personnel with an unblinking eye, depicting its first commander as a humorless martinet who nevertheless made Easy Company into a unit.  It also tells how Richard Winters, the exec, took command of the company after its second commander became a casualty.  From Normandy's hedgerows to Hitler's Alpine hideaway, Ambrose follows the 120 or so men of this small elite outfit, taking readers along on an unforgettable journey.	2003-09-12

Prange's At Dawn We Slept was a riveting book about the events that preceded and followed the attack on Pearl Harbor, many readers were disappointed by the very short description of the combat that took place over Oahu on December 7, 1941.  Three other Prange books (which were actually completed by co-authors Donald Goldstein and Katherine Dillon)<br />chronicled the revisionist theories and Prange's rebuttal (Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History); the battle of Midway (Miracle at Midway); and Soviet espionage against Japan (Target: Tokyo).  Finally, in the late 1980s, Penguin published Prange &amp; Co.'s final volume, December 7, 1941: The Day The Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor.<br />To Pearl Harbor buffs, this is the gold mine for the most dramatic nuggets dealing with the raid itself.  It tells the story of the attack's many phases from both Japanese and American viewpoints, including some heartrending recollections from military personnel and civilians who suddenly found themselves making an unexpected and sudden transition from peacetime to war.<br />Although Walter Lord's similarly themed Day of Infamy is somewhat more user-friendly as far as readability goes, December 7, 1941 is still a worthwhile entry in the crowded field of Pearl Harbor literature.	2003-09-10

Prange and his collaborators Donald Goldstein and Katherine Dillon zeroed in on the Pearl Harbor saga and its aftermath.  No less than five major books by Prange and Co. deal with the series of events that occurred before, during, and after.  Of these, At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor is the first and most important volume.<br />At Dawn We Slept covers nearly the entire 12-month period leading up to the \\"day of infamy\\" that marked America's entry into World War II.  It provides amazing insights into both the Japanese and American mindsets, and, most important, explodes the revisionists' myth that Japan's attack succeeded because President Franklin D. Roosevelt withheld critical information from Army and Navy commanders in Hawaii.<br />Prange researched the Pearl Harbor affair for 37 years until his death in 1980, and his posthumous books paint a tragic picture of two great Pacific nations reluctantly yet inexorably moving in a collision course.  Japan doesn't necessarily hate the United States, yet since the 1920s sees it as its main rival for supremacy in the Pacific.  Japan's war in China causes the rift between it and America to grow, and U.S. economic sanctions intended to end Japanese aggression against its neighbors have exactly the opposite effect on the military-dominated government in Tokyo. What once was just an abstract idea in Japan's military academies -- a transoceanic war with Britain and America -- slowly but surely comes closer to reality after Tokyo joins the Axis in 1940.  It becomes inevitable after Japan moves troops into French Indochina as a precursor to Japan's strike to conquer the resource-rich Southern area (the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Singapore, and the U.S.-controlled Philippine Islands).<br />On the Japanese side, the book shows the intense planning and preparation for the attack.  Although not flawless (the midget submarines were rather superfluous and almost gave the attack away), it was brilliant.  Driven by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's steely determination, a powerful strike force is gathered, pilots are painstakingly trained, and every resource - from innovations in ordnance (adapting torpedoes to run in very shallow waters) to a spy network on Oahu  -  is devoted to make the strike more effective.<br />At Dawn We Slept also paints a sobering picture of American complacency, ignorance, and even incompetence during the months before the attack.  Readers will learn, for instance, that Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short never truly understood his mission, which was to defend the Pacific Fleet when it was in port.  Short failed to grasp the danger of aerial attack, focusing instead on an imaginary threat from Hawaii's 125,000 Japanese-Americans.  (This mistaken notion actually caused more loss of American airpower rather than preventing it; Short ordered all planes to be lined up in the middle of their air bases so they could be more easily guarded. This just made it easier for Japanese planes to destroy or disable most of the Hawaiian Air Force.)<br />The Navy fares no better in its pre-Pearl Harbor activities, either.  Admiral Husband E. Kimmel wasn't a meek and incompetent officer, and he did have an offensive-minded posture.  Nevertheless, his failure to fully coordinate intelligence gathering, patrols, or even contingency plans with Short were factors which contributed to the success of the Japanese attack.<br />The book devotes much attention to the twists and turns that made December 7th, 1941 such a momentous day.  As someone once said, it's all in the small details.  Who knew just what impact would the typing speed of a Japanese diplomat would have on the course of history?  What would have happened if Adm. Kimmel had been immediately notified of the sinking of an unknown sub in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor?  What if Adm. Nagumo had launched a third wave that day?vicinity of Pearl Harbor?  What if Adm.

As Time Goes By: A Novel of Casablanca was ex-Time magazine music critic Michael Walsh's second novel, and it serves as both prequel and sequel to one of the most popular movies of Hollywood's Golden Age.  Unlike Scarlett, Alexandra Ripley's sequel to Margaret Mitchell`s Gone With the Wind, As Time Goes By was neither widely praised nor reviled, perhaps because there was not as much media scrutiny for Walsh's exploration of the lives of Ilsa, Rick, Victor Laszlo, Louis Renault, Sam, and all \\"the usual suspects\\"  after the fade-to-black in Casablanca.<br />Walsh was no fool when he undertook this project.  Indeed, in his afterword, he says. \\"Everyone knows Casablanca. Everyone loves Casablanca. Therein lies both the challenge and the danger of writing a novel of Casablanca.\\"<br />Walsh's approach is to treat the movie as a centerpiece sandwiched between the two timelines depicted in the 38 chapters of his novel.  His prose is crisp and fast moving, echoing the tone of the Epstein Twins' screenplay while expanding the story both backward to Rick Blaine's past in New York's seedy underworld and to a perilous mission in Victor Laszlo's Nazi-occupied homeland, Czechoslovakia.<br />Purists -- and I know there are always going to be Casablanca fans who feel this way -- will probably say the movie was fine without a sequel (forgetting or ignoring the two failed TV series based on Casablanca), but this book is a pleasure to read.  Particularly worth noting is how Walsh blends Casablanca's fictional characters and historical reality.  At the heart of As Time Goes By is Victor Laszlo's involvement in Operation Hangman, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi \\"Protector of Moravia and Bohemia\\" and architect of Hitler's \\"final solution.\\"  Although the inclusion of the Casablanca cast is fiction, the details of the operation and of its tragic aftermath are historically accurate.<br />Another bonus is Walsh's literary talent. His narrative captures the pace of its source perfectly, and his ear for the characters' voices is almost uncanny.  Readers who allow themselves to fall under this novel's spell will hear the voices of Claude Rains, Paul Heinreid, Ingrid Bergman, and especially Humphrey Bogart in the exchanges between characters.  There are also many \\"inside gags\\" for knowing Casablanca fans within the pages of this wonderful novel, such as the inclusion of  \\"As Time Goes By\\" composer  Herman Hupfeld, into the storyline.

Just as Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon followed up At Dawn We Slept with Miracle at Midway, Lord takes readers to those early June days in 1942 when the U.S. Pacific Fleet won its \\"incredible victory\\" against a vastly superior Japanese fleet.<br />Although Lord and Prange's team cover the same battle and Miracle at Midway attempts to put the Midway battle in a context for contemporary readers to grasp (the anger and resolution of the American public and media are characterized as taking place in a \\"period [which] was unique in the American experience.  A brief echo of it sounded in the 1980 hostage crisis with Iran. But in volume and intensity, that incident cannot truly compare with those few months following Pearl Harbor....\\" The 1982 book is impressively well researched and equally well written, but in some ways, Lord's narrative style is somehow more appealing.<br />Lord takes the reader back in time and into both the American and Japanese participants' many vantage points.  In a natural, easy-to-digest narrative, Lord (whose best known work is A Night to Remember, about the sinking of RMS Titanic) describes the complex sequence of events of the Battle of Midway.<br />Because Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's plan was complicated -- full of diversionary raids, multiple approaches by various fleets, and all based on the assumption of American \\"complicity,\\" Lord wisely avoids bogging down the reader with military jargon or technical analysis.  Instead, he uses an almost novelistic style, telling the story from the perspective of the participants.<br />\\"Petty Officer Heijiro Omi didn't have a word to say in excuse,\\" Lord writes at the beginning of Chapter One. \\"As the Admiral's chief steward, he was responsible for the food at this party -- and that included the tai, a carefully selected sea bream cooked whole.  It had been a happy inspiration, for tai broiled in salt meant good luck in Japan.  But this time the chef had broiled it in bean paste -- miso, to be exact -- and as every superstitious Japanese knew, that extra touch meant crowning good luck with bad.\\"<br />A seemingly trivial start, one might say, but up to June of 1942 the Japanese had had nothing but good luck.  In six months Japan had overrun Allied territories from Hong Kong, Malaya, Burma, Singapore, the Netherlands East Indies, the Philippines, New Guinea, and on to the Solomon Islands.  Even the April Doolitle Raid on Japan and the strategic loss of the Battle of the Coral Sea seemed to the Japanese to be a few minor setbacks.  Yamamoto's grand scheme, to capture the tiny atoll of Midway and lure the remnants of the United States Pacific Fleet to a final battle, was, in the minds of the Japanese, a sure recipe for victory.<br />The Americans, Lord writes in the foreword, \\"were hopelessly outclassed.\\"  Outnumbered in almost every category of warship and depending on obsolete equipment, the defenders of Midway were seemingly doomed.  Yet, with the help of naval code breakers, the quiet yet determined leadership of Admirals Chester W. Nimitz and Raymond A. Spruance (who had replaced the war weary and temporarily sidelined William F. Halsey as a task force commander), and the raw courage of Midway's motley crew of sea- and land-based defenders, the Americans won the Battle of Midway and stopped Japan's advances in the Pacific.<br />Lord points out that the biggest reason Midway was such a disaster was the Japanese overconfident mindset.  The plan, impressive on maps (with all the arrows depicting Japanese fleets converging on one spot from various directions), was far too complex for its own good.  Too many ships were scattered on different missions, violating the military principle of concentration of force.  Worse, everything depended on the Americans reacting exactly the way the Japanese expected them to.  The plandid not allow for any unplanned contingencies, and even though the Japanese gave the U.S. Navy a bloody nose with the sinking of USS Yorktown and a destroyer (in addition to shooting down many American aircraft), Nimitz and Spruance won an incredible victory over a formidable foe.did not allow for any unplanned contingencies, and even though the Japanese gave the U.S. Navy a bloody nose with the sinking of USS Yorktown and a destroyer (in addition to shooting down many American aircraft), Nimitz and Spruance won an incredible victory over a formidable foe.	2003-08-27

Although 17 years have passed since Tom Clancy's second novel was published and the Soviet Union is no more, Red Storm Rising is still one of my favorite adventure novels. It is always a challenge for writers to top a blockbuster hit like The Hunt For Red October, but Clancy and his co-author Larry Bond (Red Phoenix, Vortex) gave us an E-ticket ride with this tale of World War III. If Hunt's chase of a defecting Typhoon-class sub was impressive in its scope and believability, Red Storm Rising is even more impressive in scale and ambitious plotting. While the familiar aspects of U.S.-Soviet confrontation are back, this time the Soviets are not simply after a runaway submarine but the oil fields of the Persian Gulf. After Islamic radicals sabotage a large oil production complex in Siberia, the Politburo decides that the West will not let the USSR purchase oil to make up for the shortfall. Deluded by their own propaganda and by KGB reports written by a faction which sees war as the quickest solution to the problem, the hardliners decide they must invade Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 'If we cannot purchase oil,' declares one minister, 'then we must take it.' But the operation can't take place, the Soviets decide, if NATO and the United States intervene. Following the maxim that the best defense is always a good offense, the move south on the oil fields is put on hold until another operation, a strike against the West, takes place. So begins a complicated series of operations centered on a Third Battle of the Atlantic. While Soviet ground and air forces invade West Germany, the Red Fleet uses its surface, submarine and naval air forces to sever the sea lanes between America and her NATO allies in Europe. Clancy's canvas is large and vivid, taking us from the secret meetings of the Politburo, to the attack center of a Los Angeles-class SSN, to the lonely trek of a small group of Americans trapped on Soviet-occupied Iceland, and the bloody battlefields of West Germany. Clancy and Bond create a wonderful cast of characters who, even 17 years after they were created, still capture the imagination.<br />Also recommended: Executive Orders, by Tom Clancy; Red Phoenix, by Larry Bond; Debt of Honor, by Tom Clancycy and Bond create a wonderful cast of characters who, even 17 years after they were created, still capture the imagination. <br />Also recommended: Executive Orders, by Tom Clancy; Red Phoenix, by Larry Bond; Debt of Honor, by Tom Clancy	2003-07-13

I admit it; I am one of those rare fans who apparently enjoyed Episodes I and II, and I owned this book several weeks before Attack of the Clones was released in May 2002.<br />The book is beautifully designed and Mark Cotta Vaz's accompanying text to the conceptual art is authoritative yet accesible even to younger readers.  The many designs -- even those not used in the movie -- evoke memories of the earlier trilogy's Art of...series, and one can see the \\"evolution\\" of the many ship and costume designs to what fans call Classic Star Wars.  (To me, the most interesting \\"fact\\" is that Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter's lines will be echoed in the evil Empire's Imperial Star Destroyer.)<br />The screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales (who also wrote the story for The Scorpion King) is included.  It is the complete \\"before edits were made to the film\\" draft, which allows readers to catch glimpses of Padme Amidala's family and other scenes that were filmed but later deleted.  (Those scenes are included on the extra features disc of the Episode II DVD set, but some fans may only have the VHS version instead.)<br />For Star Wars fans and film art aficionados, this book is definitely a keeper.	2003-07-12

Within 24 hours, despite horrible losses at some points, the first wave of invaders breached the German line and a huge Allied host began pouring ashore.<br />Peter G. Tsouras, tweaking history's reality by presenting a plausible chain of alternate events, paints a chilling picture of a German victory over the invading Allies.  In Tsouras' fictional history, German armored units destroy the Omaha Beach landings, Hitler and his generals react much faster than they actually did, and nothing the Allies attempt to do in order to save Operation Overlord works.<br />Tsouras uses the techniques of a traditional historian.  His prose is straightforward and never veers into novelistic style, even though this is, indeed, a novel by any other name.  The use of maps, photographs and footnotes gives the book the feel of a \\"real\\" history book.<br />The only complaint I have is the choice of typeface....it's too small and makes the text a bit hard to read.

It is a story as old as mankind: as long as there are chemicals that can enhance or distort moods, there will always be a market for the wares offered by men like Pablo Escobar.<br />The book is excellently written and covers a 45 year period in Colombian history. It puts into perspective how social and historical upheavals both in Colombia and the United States converged to allow men (and women) to become involved in the illegal drug trade.  It exposes the social lines in Colombian society and how the friction between classes gave Pablo the impetus to become the most powerful criminal in the country.<br />Ultimately, Bowden's book is an eye-opener, and anyone interested in finding out the truth about the deadly embrace between America and the illegal drug trade should read Killing Pablo.	2003-07-09

As in The Longest Day (1959) and A Bridge Too Far (1974), Ryan weaves his narrative tapestry with meticulous research and eyewitness accounts of military and civilians on all sides who were caught up in the cataclysmic events of that terrible spring of 1945.<br />It is April, 1945, and Germany is tottering at the edge of defeat. On the Western Front, General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied armies have crossed the Rhine, the Reich's last natural defense against invasion from the west.  Now, sensing that victory is near, American, British, Canadian and other Allied divisions are racing for the Elbe River and beyond - with Berlin as the long expected prize.<br />In the East, millions of Soviet soldiers have swept into Germany from the Baltic states and Poland, storming into the Nazi heartland with blood and fire.  Urged on by their thirst for revenge and the orders of Red dictator Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Army also races west toward the German capital.  Here the dying Third Reich will stand or die in its last battle.<br />Ryan deals here not only with the fall of Berlin, but he also explores in detail the very complicated political and military issues behind Eisenhower's most controversial decision of the War: the Western Allies would not cross beyond the Elbe River to capture Hitler's capital.  Though Ryan's tone is impartial and he delves deeply into the wrangling between President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill and Premier Stalin, the reader is still left with the impression that the plans dealing with Germany's postwar fate sowed the seeds of the Cold War which followed V-E Day.<br />The Last Battle, although longer and far more complex than The Longest Day, is a very human story that keeps the reader involved.  One feels the suspense of the frantic Allied advance eastward, cheering the \\"Amis\\" (as the Germans nicknamed the Americans) on even though it will be the Red Army that gets to Berlin first.  The German participants, military and civilian alike, are depicted fairly and without the expected \\"victor's triumphal\\" tone that would have painted all the Germans as Nazi villains.  Indeed, one can feel sympathy for Berliners who - with the exception of Hitler and his most loyal followers - would rather be at the mercy of the British and Americans rather than fall to the feared Russians.  It must be said, however, that although Ryan wrote this book during the Cold War, he is fair and balanced in his reporting of the Soviet advance to Berlin.s\\" (as the Germans nicknamed the Americans) on even though it will be the Red Army that gets to Berlin first.

It is also the closest that a Clancy novel resembles an Ian Fleming James Bond story, although Jack Ryan never steps out of his non-Bondian character.<br />In some of the better Bond films (From Russia With Love comes to mind), 007 was often sent to either steal or destroy some new gadget or weapon that would upset the power balance between the non-communist West and the Soviet bloc.  And although The Hunt for Red October had some of this thematic linkage to Ian Fleming's \\"restoration of the balance of power\\" stories, Cardinal of the Kremlin is Clancy's deepest exploration of the notion that espionage-is-the-best-defense when superpowers are in an arms race.<br />Set one year after the defection of Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin chronicles the efforts of both the United States and the Soviet Union to develop a defensive system against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), even as both sides are negotiating a treaty to reduce their nuclear arsenals.  Both superpowers want information on their opponents' \\"Star Wars\\" programs; both nations' intelligence agencies have agents and \\"moles\\" working feverishly to get that information.<br />Of these \\"moles\\" (insiders who spy for the \\"other side\\"), none is more important than the agent the CIA knows as \\"Cardinal.\\"  \\"Cardinal\\" is perhaps America's most highly prized intelligent source, for he is none other than Col. Mikhail \\"Misha\\" Filitov, a highly decorated hero of the Great Patriotic War (World War II). A three-time winner of the Hero of the Soviet Union and wounded in the largest tank battle of the war at Kursk, this once-loyal officer has become disillusioned by the nature of the State he has served and becomes a spy for America.  His status as a bona fide hero allows him to become an aide to two Defense Ministers, making \\"Cardinal\\" a fine source of classified material to the Central Intelligence Agency.  It is through \\"Cardinal\\" that CIA discovers how far along the Soviets' own Star Wars program is coming.<br />On the Soviet side, the American mole is Bea Taussig, an embittered scientist who has a grudge with one of the military officers who is assigned to the Star Wars project.  Although she also gets a thrill by trying to outsmart the FBI and CIA by providing her KGB \\"handlers\\" with classified information, her agenda is far more personal.<br />As in most of Clancy's Ryan novels, the action is far-flung.  The plot takes readers from the cubicles of CIA headquarters at Langley, VA, to the snow-capped peaks of Afghanistan (where the mujahedin are fighting the Soviet occupation), to the halls of power of both Washington and Moscow.<br />Here, too, Clancy continues his technique of weaving the Ryan novels into one big tapestry.

With the success of The Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising (Clancy's only major novel not connected to the Ryan saga), Clancy took readers back to Ryan's pre-Red October past in a tale which deals with the shadowy world of terrorism.<br />On a working vacation in London with wife Caroline (Cathy) and daughter Olivia (better known as Sally), Ryan is the accidental tourist-turned-rescuer when he literally runs into a brutal terrorist attack on the Prince and Princess of Wales and their baby.  Without stopping to even think about it, Jack, a former Marine second lieutenant and now a professor at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, kills one terrorist and wounds another. Ryan is wounded in the brief shootout, but he survives and earns the gratitude (and an honorary knighthood) of the Royal Family.<br />Unbeknownst to Ryan, he also gets the attention of two very different groups.  In Langley, VA, CIA Deputy Director, Intelligence (DDI) James Greer is impressed by Ryan's bravery and resourcefulness.  He already knows Ryan is good CIA-analyst material; Jack has done some outside consulting for the Agency.  Now Greer wants to recruit Ryan to work full-time at CIA.<br />The other group whose attention is on Ryan is less savory.  It is the Ulster Liberation Army, a far-left extremist faction which has broken away from the Irish Republican Army.  While sharing the IRA's desire to rid Ireland of British troops and break away from the United Kingdom, the ULA also wants an Irish Marxist state to rule the Emerald Isle.  Thwarted in their bold attack on the Royals and thirsting for revenge against Ryan, ULA leader Kevin O'Donnell and his cohorts free the terrorist Ryan wounded and caused to be tried, convicted and punished, Sean Miller.<br />This novel not only deals with the shadow-world of terrorism and the agencies that combat this global scourge, but it also delves into the concepts of right versus wrong, honor, and the role of the family in society.  Clancy, himself an Irish-American, has little sympathy for the violent means that Irish \\"freedom fighters\\" (and pro-British counterparts) have been using in Northern Ireland since 1969.  He contrasts the stability of the Ryan family (and the fictionalized Royals) to the moral vacuum of the lone wolves and traitors who make up the ULA.  The theme of the book is summed up by a quote by Edmund Burke:  \\"When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, and unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\\"<br />As in the 1992 film adaptation, Patriot Games sets up a cat-and-mouse game as Miller and O'Donnell plot revenge against Ryan and to finish the mission the \\"meddling Yank\\" foiled.  The storyline of the novel is obviously more complicated, and Clancy here uses a technique he will later use throughout the rest of the Ryan novels.  He will introduce characters such as FBI Agents Dan Murray and Bill Shaw, who will be more prominent in later works such as Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears, and Debt of Honor.  The ending, too, is more cerebral and less explosive than that of Philip Noyce's film version, with plot strands that will not be resolved so easily.f right versus wrong, honor, and the role of the family in society.

As in his two previous works, The Longest Day (1959) and The Last Battle (1966), Ryan relies on clear and crisp narrative, painstaking research, and hundreds of anecdotes from Allied, Dutch and German participants.<br />As the Germans retreated from France and Belgium in the late summer of 1944, the victorious Allies found themselves in a dilemma created by their own success. With most of the Channel ports either still in German hands or damaged too extensively to be of any use, the American, British, and Canadian armies outran their supply lines. Gas, fuel, and munitions had to be driven from the Normandy beaches to the front line, which in some places was 400 miles distant. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, desperately needed to capture the Belgian port of Antwerp, Europe's largest.<br />Another serious problem facing the Allies was British General (later Field Marshal) Bernard L. Montgomery. Montgomery - or Monty, as he was known to the public - was Britain's most popular general as a result of his victory over German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel at El Alamein. Because Montgomery was considered a master of the \\"set-piece battle,\\" Eisenhower had appointed him as the chief ground commander of the Allied forces for the duration of the Normandy campaign, with the understanding that Ike would then assume direct command on September 1, 1944.<br />Despite the mixed performance of Montgomery in Normandy (his British-Canadian forces had taken Caen - a D-Day objective - only after a month's worth of battles), the British general was reluctant to give up the ground forces command. Although a brilliant officer, Monty was also aloof and arrogant...and ambitious. He did not seem to understand that the Americans were fast becoming the predominant force in Western Europe, while Britain had reached the limit of her available manpower. He insisted - with the support of some of his superiors in Whitehall - that he be given command of all Allied ground forces, something that was militarily and politically unacceptable to the other partners of the coalition.<br />Montgomery also proposed a decisive \\"full-blooded thrust\\" to cross the Rhine River and take the Ruhr valley, Germany's industrial heartland. He proposed that Eisenhower give him command of forty divisions (pointedly excluding his American rival, Gen. George S. Patton, Jr. and his Third Army) to achieve this.<br />Eisenhower refused. But on Sept. 4, 1944, the British Second Army captured the port city of Antwerp. Soon after that, German V-2 rockets launched from Nazi-occupied Holland fell on London. This gave Montgomery a chance to propose a contingency plan that might, just might, lead to a bridgehead over the Rhine - and even into Germany itself.<br />Thus Operation Market-Garden was conceived.<br />Market-Garden was to be what is known as a combined-arms vertical envelopment. Market, the airborne element, involved the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the British 1st Airborne Division, and the Polish 1st Airborne Brigade. They were to be dropped - in history's largest airborne operation - in daylight onto a series of drop and landing zones near a series of bridges which linked a single highway from Eindhoven in the south to Arnhem on the Lower Rhine. Garden, the ground element, consisted of British Gen. Brian Horrocks' XXX Corps, a powerful armored force which was expected to make the 64-mile drive to Arnhem in two days.

Based on hundreds of interviews with Allied, German, and French participants, for many years The Longest Day was the best of the many books written about what Stephen E. Ambrose once called the climactic battle of World War II.<br />Ryan divides his book into three parts: The Wait, which tells how the Allies and the Germans prepared for the invasion; The Night, which describes the confusion and complications of the nighttime airborne assault; and The Day, which, of course, takes readers onto the five invasion beaches, where so many acts of bravery and so many horrific scenes took place.  Ryan skillfully lets the accounts of the veterans from both warring sides blend into his crisp and clear prose, grabbing the reader's attention and never letting go.<br />The Longest Day was followed by many other works on the topic of D-Day by such authors as David Howarth, John Keegan, Paul Carell (\\"the German Cornelius Ryan\\"), Max Hastings, and, of course, the late Stephen Ambrose.  It was also abridged in several issues of Readers' Digest (which lent its support in research and interviewing participants), and was adapted into a major motion picture by Darryl F. Zanuck and 20th Century Fox in 1962.	2003-06-20

Adolf Hitler has been in power for 31 years, his 75th birthday nears, and a summit meeting between the Fuhrer and President Kennedy has been announced.<br /><br /> This is the intriguing scenario presented by British journalist-novelist Robert Harris in his first novel, Fatherland.<br /><br /> Harris' novel, unlike Peter Tsouras' Disaster at D-Day: The Germans Defeat the Allies, June 1944, doesn't offer us a very detailed &quot;alternative history&quot; of the Second World War, which perhaps would have been the easy way out for a lesser writer. Instead, Harris smartly teases us with little glimpses at how Germany could have won the war while still losing its collective soul.<br /><br /> Fatherland's plot revolves around Xavier March, a former U-boat skipper who has joined the German police, which has been under SS control since the mid-1930s. On a rainy April morning, March has been called to investigate what seems to be a routine incident: a corpse has been found in the Havel River near the area where high Nazi party officials have their mansions.<br /><br /> Of course, if you have read political-police thrillers such as Gorky Park or Archangel, you know there will be nothing routine about this investigation. For this corpse's identity is none other than Doctor Josef Buhler, one of the earliest Nazi party members and former state secretary in the General Government, the part of Poland directly annexed by the Third Reich during the war. Before long, March (who is not a Nazi party member, just a dogged investigator) will follow Buhler's seemingly routine death down a dark and winding path that will lead him to Germany's darkest and best kept secret of all.<br /><br /> For history buffs, this book is a fascinating look at what a mid-1960s Nazi Germany might have been like. Harris paints a chilling portrait of a country still at war with what remains of the Soviet Union while in a cold war with a nuclear-armed United States. Berlin is imagined as Hitler and his architect Albert Speer would have rebuilt it at war's end (in the frontispiece there is an artist's rendering of Hitler's vision for his capital), and readers will shudder with horror to see how far the Nazis' indoctrination of children extended.<br /><br /> Harris keeps things going at a brisk pace, never boring readers or insulting their intelligence. His fictional characters interact with historical characters (although, of course, their fates ended up differently in real life, thank goodness) in a believable fashion. Of course, this type of novel requires willing suspension of disbelief, but it is well-written and, in the end, eye-opening.United States.

It propelled Clancy, who had been an insurance salesman with only a few letters to the editor under his writing belt, to best-selling superstar.  His success with military and espionage-related fiction earned him a title he does not readily accept: father of the techno-thriller.<br /><br />This novel, if I remember correctly, was the first work of fiction published by the Naval Institute Press, the publishing arm of the United States Naval Institute, a civilian entity which promotes all things naval, including the study of naval history, strategy, technology, and tactics. Some of the Naval Institute Press' other books include A.D. Baker's Fleets of the World, Clay Blair, Jr.'s Silent Victory, and Norman Friedman's Desert Victory: The War for Kuwait.  But considering that although Clancy's novel deals with the workings of other federal agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI, the National Security Agency, and both the Executive and Legislative branches, the heart of the story is a sea chase.<br /><br />Based loosely on a 1975 incident in which a Soviet frigate attempted to defect to the West, The Hunt for Red October tells the by-now familiar tale of how Captain First Rank Marko Ramius and a group of selected officers aboard the Soviet Navy's newest Typhoon-class SSBN (the Navy designator for a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, or \\"boomer\\") band together to defect to the United States and hand over the Red Navy's most advanced \\"stealth\\" submarine.<br /><br />Ramius, you see, is motivated by one of the strongest emotions of all: the desire for revenge against the callous Soviet state.  Not only for the death of his wife as a result of negligence by a well-connected surgeon, but for all the injustices he has witnessed from even his early childhood. His father, a Lithuanian communist and devoted Party apparatchik, was responsible for many deaths and unjust acts, and Marko, raised by a decent grandmother, sees both his father and the State as monsters who care for nothing but power and expansion.<br /><br />In this novel, set sometime in the mid-1980s, Clancy introduces us to Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst being groomed by his mentor, Admiral James Greer, for better and more crucial postings within the Agency.  Now currently assigned as CIA liaison in London (which puts this novel's setting to be after the current Clancy novel Red Rabbit), it is Ryan who first hands the U.S. its first intelligence data on Red October, courtesy of the British Secret Service.<br /><br />The novel's focus is on Ramius' defection attempt aboard the Red October, which has been modified to use a \\"caterpillar\\" drive (described in the movie version as a \\"jet engine for the water\\") which enables a sub to glide through the ocean almost undetectably.  It also deals with the Red Navy's desperate attempts to seek and destroy the defectors' submarine, and the almost equally desperate moves of an Anglo-American fleet to acquire Red October.<br /><br />The novel, as if often the case, is far better than its film adaptation.  Not that John McTiernan did a bad job with Paramount's 1990 feature film, but in slimming down the characters and situations to fit within a 2-hour movie, far too many exciting scenes were ignored and the scope of the sea chase is narrowed down from \\"seeing\\" almost the whole spectrum of the Soviet Navy in the novel to actually seeing one Bear-Foxtrot anti-submarine bomber and one Alfa-class attack sub.

Both series had increased NPR's audience significantly, and many Star Wars fans waited anxiously for the conclusion of the George Lucas trilogy set \\"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\\" to hit the airwaves.<br />However, the mid- to late 1980s were a \\"dark time\\" for public broadcasting as Congress (no doubt guided by the Sith) cut back on funding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (partially because Republicans felt there was too much of a liberal slant in both NPR and its television counterpart, PBS).  And even though  George Lucas had generously donated the radio rights to KUSC-Los Angeles (his alma mater's radio station) for $1.00, producing even a short Star Wars radio series was expensive, so for over 12 years the Return of the Jedi adaptation lived only in the hopes and dreams of writer Brian Daley, sound engineer Tom Voegeli, and thousands of Star Wars fans.<br />Enter Highbridge Audio.  This Minnesota-based company produced the audio cassette and CD releases of both Star Wars radio dramas, and possibly because of good sales they commissioned most of the team behind the Star Wars and Empire serials.  Daley was again at the writing helm, even as he bravely fought a battle with cancer. John Madden, a veteran radio and film director, returned to direct.  And while Mark Hamill was not available to reprise his role as Luke Skywalker, all of the other cast members from the previous Radio Dramas returned: Ken Hiller as the Narrator, Perry King as Han Solo, Ann Sachs as Leia, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Bernard Behrens as Ben Kenobi, John Lithgow as Yoda and Brock Peters as Lord Darth Vader.  Rounding out the cast:  Joshua Fardon as a passable Luke Skywalker, Ed Begley, Jr. as Boba Fett, Ed Asner (of Lou Grant fame) as Jabba the Hutt,  Arye Gross as Lando Calrissian and Paul Hecht as Emperor Palpatine.<br />Of all the Radio Dramas, Return of the Jedi is the shortest: six episodes and a running time of almost three hours.  Thus the focus is on the events depicted within the film and very few extra scenes.  The opening is different: Jedi begins with Luke completing his lightsaber, followed by a meeting between Darth Vader and the Emperor on Coruscant (the feeling I got was that the two Dark Jedi Masters sensed Luke's Force growth just as he ignites his laser sword on Tatooine).  The movie's opening scene (Vader's arrival on the unfinished second Death Star) is moved to mid-series, since most of Episodes 1 and 2 deal with Han's rescue from Jabba's palace.<br />Here, for the first time in Star Wars history, elements from the expanded universe novels are introduced into a \\"canon\\" (i.e., a \\"real\\" Star Wars Trilogy) story.  Emperor's Hand Mara Jade makes a cameo disguised as Arica, a dancer newly hired by Jabba the Hutt.  And a reference is made to events that took place in Steve Perry's novel Shadows of the Empire.<br />Return of the Jedi's strengths and weaknesses are the same as the ones in its predecessors.  It adds depth and shading to characters and situations we are already familiar with, and the music by John Williams and sound effects by Ben Burtt give the project the right Star Wars \\"feel.\\"  Fans new to the actors playing roles originated by Hamill, Carrie Fisher, James Earl Jones, Harrison Ford, Frank Oz, and the other major actors may have to be patient with getting used to the substitutes.  Also, the radio convention of characters describing what they are seeing and doing may prove annoying to some.  However, this is not a common technique, and most of us who have listened to the Trilogy on Radio have enjoyed it.<br />Will there be Radio Dramas of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones?  At present, Lucasfilm has not announced any plans to create any.  And on a sad note, Brian Daley died in 1996 just as recording sessions were being finished, and Highbridge Audio and the production crew dedicated the show to his memory.essions were being finished, and Highbridge Audio and the production crew dedicated the show to his memory.	2003-05-12

Having attracted large audiences (for public radio) with the Star Wars Radio Drama, NPR and everyone involved in the ambitious project were anxious to prove that lightning could, indeed, strike twice.<br />After all, Star Wars films are best known for their visual effects, so many people, including fans, were surprised that Star Wars worked well as a radio serial.  But visuals are only part of the movie-going experience, after all.  Where would any movie be without characters? Or sound? Or music? Or, for that matter, a coherent narrative thread?  (And before someone points out that movies were silent once, I will remind readers that yes, they were silent, but they had musical accompaniment.)  Furthermore, expanding the two-hour-plus film into 10 episodes gave familiar characters both depth and color.<br />The Empire Strikes Back Radio Drama opens with action when a Rebel convoy bound for Hoth is ambushed by waves of Imperial TIE fighters and annihilated near Derra IV.  We then cut directly to the opening of the movie, when an Imperial Star Destroyer launches a batch of probe droids programmed to seek out the Rebels' new hidden base.  Then we are reunited with our favorite heroes on the icy planet Hoth....and, well, if you have seen the classic trilogy, you know the Empire will definitely strike back.<br />In addition to the original cast from the Star Wars Radio Drama (which included Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels - both reprising their film roles of Luke Skywalker and C-3PO - Perry King, Ann Sachs, Bernard Behrens, and Brock Peters), Madden was able to enlist Billy Dee Williams to be the voice of Lando Calrissian, the charming but duplicitous Baron Administrator of Cloud City.  To round out the major characters from Empire, John Lithgow was cast as Yoda.  (He doesn't sound much like Frank Oz, but after a while one gets used to this and gets swept away in the story.)<br />Although this Radio Drama also expands the story somewhat (it has 10 episodes and runs for roughly five hours), it sticks to its source material and leaves the cliffhanger ending intact.  Most of the new material covers the prelude to the battle of Hoth (we get to hear Han and Luke trying to survive that horrible night in an emergency shelter on the ice plains near Echo Base, for instance),  and of course Daley and Madden often have to resort to the old radio conventions of characters having to say what they see or are doing.<br />There were, of course, plans to make a radio adaptation of Return of the Jedi, but it got, as Han Solo says in that film to Jabba, \\"a little sidetracked\\" by budget woes at NPR.  It did get made at last, but that story will have to wait a bit....Empire, John Lithgow was cast as Yoda.

Star Wars, a movie best known for its vistas of alien worlds and epic battles, as a 13 part radio drama?  No way would it work, right?<br />Well, unless you have the cold heart of a Sith, Star Wars did indeed translate well from the silver screen to radio, thank you very much.  Yes, Star Wars' visual effects are a big part of the magic of the saga, but the heart and soul of George Lucas' galaxy far, far away are the characters and the storyline. And while the movie is satisfying on its own, the radio dramatization written by the late Brian Daley takes us beyond the movie....beyond the screenplay...and even beyond the novelization.<br />By expanding the movie's story beyond its two hour running time, the Radio Drama allows us to catch glimpses of Luke Skywalker's life BEFORE the movie.  It tells us how Princess Leia acquired the Death Star plans....and what, exactly, happened to her during her interrogation aboard the Empire's battle station...(it is an interesting scene, but not for the squeamish, by the way). In short, by expanding the story to nearly seven hours, characters we loved on screen acquire depth only equaled by novelizations.<br />The Radio Drama makes extensive use of material written (and in some cases filmed) for A New Hope's silver screen version but cut for editorial or technical reasons.  Also, Ben Burtt's sound effects, John Williams' score, and the acting of Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (See Threepio) give the whole project its \\"true\\" Star Wars cachet.	2003-05-03

And for many years Ryan's book was, in my opinion, the best book on the subject.  I read other books on D-Day by authors such as Howarth and Hastings, but Ryan was the one author whose D-Day story always came to my mind.<br />That is, until I read Stephen Ambrose's D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II.<br />Although The Longest Day is still a wonderful book to read, Ambrose's book is now considered by many to be the definitive book about the events that took place on D-Day.  Although both books tell the same story, Ambrose weaves a far more detailed tapestry than Ryan did way back in 1959.  And while both authors focused on participants' accounts to give their books a \\"grunt's eye\\" view of the D-Day invasion, Ambrose refrains from tweaking people's personalities to suit his personal sense of morality as Ryan did.  (In both the book and screenplay for The Longest Day, Ryan portrayed PFC Arthur \\"Dutch\\" Schultz as a proper Catholic boy and told a cleaned up version of how Schultz won, then lost, $2,500 in a game of craps.)<br />Ambrose's strength as a historian-author is his straightforward writing style, which is accessible without being simplistic.  He wrote the way he spoke: as a friendly, almost fatherly college professor who enjoyed sharing his love of history with his students and readers.  His prose is crisp and never dull (something he shared with Cornelius Ryan, who he respected even if he disagreed with some of the conclusions Ryan presented in his book), and although he describes scenes of utter chaos and carnage, there are touches of humor and human foibles as well.  Thus, the narrative flows effortlessly and Ambrose allows the veterans and eyewitnesses on all sides to tell their stories in their own words.<br />Ambrose passed away a few months ago, but his legacy willl endure in this \\"love song to democracy,\\" as he described this wonderful book.mbrose passed away a few months ago, but his legacy willl endure in this \\"love song to democracy,\\" as he described this wonderful book.	2003-04-24

Most of us then turn to the myriads of Star Wars discussion groups and analyze the existing five movies (sometimes going off into bizarre tangents such as the \\"is Palpatine really Darth Sidious or isn't he?\\") and, like fortune tellers reading tea leaves, try to divine the particulars of the next Episode.<br />Another thing we Star Wars fans do while we wait for new Episodes is wondering what happens to the characters between Episodes, especially when  the span of time (10 years between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones...and four between Episodes II and III, for instance)is long. Or maybe we hear a line in an existing film about something that happened prior to the current movie and we want to know more.<br />This is where the Expanded Universe novels are at their best, when they address events mentioned but not seen in the film series.  Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter and Cloak of Deception, both Episode I prequels, fill in some of the blanks dealing with the rise of Palpatine in the Senate and explain somewhat better the blockade of Naboo. Greg Bear's Rogue Planet also showed a glimpse of 12-year-old Anakin Skywalker's relationship to Obi-Wan Kenobi and his life as a Padawan learner.<br />Of all the prequels to the Prequels, though, Alan Dean Foster's The Approaching Storm works best as an appetizer to Episode II.  While it is a novel that has characters created by Foster alone, it also teems with major and minor characters who appeared in Episode II.  The plot revolves around a border dispute on the planet Ansion, a minor planet by itself but bound by a series of treaties to other systems.  In the shadows lurk the separatists led by Count Dooku, who makes a brief literary cameo.<br />Although the hardcover of this novel was released 4 months before the premiere of Episode II, I only read the paperback version in December of 2002, so I wasn't bugged by the spoilers or by the constraints imposed by Lucasfilm so fans would not find out too much about the plot of Episode II far, far in advance.<br />Because Foster wrote the novelization to Star Wars: A New Hope, he captures the voices and personalities of the movies well.  He also is wonderful at creating his own characters, even if they are characters who will never be seen on film.  The Approaching Storm is therefore a fun and exciting novel that makes the two-year wait for the conclusion of the Prequel Trilogy more bearable.ecember of 2002, so I wasn't bugged by the spoilers or by the constraints imposed by Lucasfilm so fans would not find out too much about the plot of Episode II far, far in advance.<br />Because Foster wrote the novelization to Star Wars: A New Hope, he captures the voices and personalities of the movies well.

It is true of Star Trek, where some novelists (David Gerrold, J.M. Dillard) leave you wanting for more, while others (and Vonda N. McIntyre) either leave you indifferent or enraged that you actually paid good money to read that godawful book.<br />Star Wars, too, has its peaks and valleys as far as the Expanded Universe goes (although, judging from the mixed reviews to Episodes I and II, the movies are not, and have never been, critic-proof).  Some SW authors (Timothy Zahn comes to mind) are wonderful, with an eye and especially an ear for the characters we love from the Classic Trilogy.  Even when they mix the &quot;canon&quot; cast (Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids....)with their own characters (Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, etc.), the really good writers carry us into the story and off to that galaxy far, far away.....<br />Sadly to say, The Crystal Star is not written by a great Star Wars author.  Yes, I know that Vonda McIntyre is an award-winning SF writer and wrote three of the 10 Star Trek movies' novelizations (the ones for Star Treks II, III, and IV).  She did an OK job with them, even though some of her personal additions to the storylines were often annoyingly distracting.  Still, she seemed to get the characters' voices down pat, but then of course she was working from screenplay drafts so it really doesn't seem like a stretch to accomplish THAT.<br />But if McIntyre's talent was sufficient for Star Trek, it failed her in the SW galaxy.  Of all the stories I have read so far (and I have not read any New Jedi Order books as of April 2003), this is one of the weakest and even dull ones I have read.  I won't go much into detail about what I don't like about this novel; other customer reviews have pointed out the same flaws that bother me.

This book is one of the best works I have read about the Pacific War and it is one of my favorite accounts of the Battle of Midway.  Even though it is not a Pearl Harbor-only volume like other books by Prange, Dillon, and Goldstein, I agree with Penguin's characterization of Miracle at Midway as a sequel to At Dawn We Slept, Prange's definitive account of the events before, during, and after the Day of Infamy.<br />Miracle at Midway picks up the narrative of events soon after the Pearl Harbor Striking Force under the command of Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo returns to Japan, hailed as heroes by everyone in the Empire.  It then, economically and without bogging down in detail, describes the events that led to the battle of Midway, a small atoll at the far end of the Hawaiian island chains.<br />Attention to detail is given to the planning and execution of both American and Japanese operations in the Midway battle.  Prange and his co-authors point out that Midway was Pearl Harbor in reverse; the Japanese, who had been careful and canny in December 1941, were overconfident and somewhat sloppy in planning and executing Operation MI.  The Americans, who had been caught unprepared six months earlier, were able to break Japan's JN-25 Naval Communications Code and set a carefully laid ambush in the path of Japan's mighty First Air Fleet.<br />This book is highly readable (though I prefer Walter Lord's Incredible Victory), and I give it a strong recommendation, even though it has very few pictures and even fewer maps.	2003-04-19

When I bought this a couple of years ago, I thought I would be getting something really special. I mean, come on...how could I not? Dark Horse...Star Wars....the Special Edition. I was rather disappointed to see that, although A New Hope's comic book adaptation in this boxed set was, indeed, all new, it read like a Cliff's Notes of Episode IV. Whereas my complaint with Marvel's original comic adaptation was something art-work related (some of it was crude in spots), at least it included the movie's entire story. The art in this new version is by far better, but plot-wise, the editorial content is poor. If one of Marvel's discrepancies in its Star Wars adaptation was the inclusion of deleted scenes, Dark Horse's A New Hope commits a worse sin: entire scenes are missing!<br />The other two Episodes...The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi....they have the Dark Horse Comics logo and new cover art, but aside from a quick makeover of Yoda in Episode V (the original version done in 1980 had a Yoda that looked like a preliminary sketch rather than the Frank Oz version we saw in the film), these are just re-issues of the Marvel movie tie-ins. Believe me, the prequel comic adaptations by Henry Gilroy are superior....	2003-04-16

The 25th Anniversary edition of The Star Wars Trilogy breaks no new ground or make any editorial changes to the three movie tie-in novels based on the screenplays for Star Wars (now known as A New Hope), The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.  There are no adjustments or rewrites to make the novels match the Special Edition re-releases of 1997.  It isn't even the first time all three novels are collected in one volume...there are mass-market and trade paperback three-in-one editions.  The only new features are the cover art by Ralph McQuarrie, the conceptual artist whose paintings &quot;sold&quot; George Lucas' &quot;out of this world&quot; ideas to leery 20th Century Fox executives and short intros to each novelization by Lucas himself. Whether or not those were written for the 25th Anniversary Edition or if they appeared in other reissues of the novels isn't important; what is important is that the 25th Anniversary Edition's elegant package recaptures the magic of reading the Classic Trilogy....<br />Like most novelizations of popular movies, the authors (Alan Dean Foster being the ghostwriter for George Lucas, Donald F. Glut, and James Kahn) have adapted the screenplays to Episodes IV, V and VI with a certain sense of unity, yet each writer has a distinctive style of his own. On the whole, the best writer is Foster, who had, before Star Wars, adapted the Star Trek animated series into the Star Trek Logs series.  Very few Star Wars authors, with the exception of Timothy Zahn and a few others, capture the essence of the characters and situations of the movies as well as Foster.  Glut is almost as good a writer, and his style is not all that different from Foster's.  Kahn's style is minimalist. I like the Jedi novelization, but there is a strange sense of connect-the-dots permeating it all the same.<br />All right, so we aren't talking great literature here, and I do know that the writers work from drafts of the screenplay that are different from the final shooting script. That's why Luke Skywalker's comm sign in the novel of A New Hope is Blue Five; in the movie the callsign is Red Five.  And the novels do expand the storyline and &quot;restore&quot; deleted scenes....the literary equivalent of a DVD extra features disc, you might say.<br />I rate this book 5 stars not because it is brilliantly written or philosophically meaningful, but rather because it recaptures the magic of reading those dog-eared paperbacks, but with a bit more class.shooting script.

And of course, the artists and writers do their best to catch the spirit, if not the letter, of a movie. This is hard to accomplish, yet Henry Gilroy and his crew manage to catch Episode II's spirit very well, if imperfectly. I subtracted one star for minor gripes here and there.....but otherwise, worth having in one's Star Wars library.	2003-04-15
US	43389853	R1UVPQOMQ4FYDS	0345306279	806168919	Art of Star Wars	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Five stars for content, minus one for durability	In 1979, Ballantine Books (then the sole licensed publisher of Star Wars novels and most tie-ins) published two versions of this book. One was a limited edition hardcover, which I have never seen, the other was one of those &quot;trade paperback&quot; editions (coffee table size but in softcover).  What made this book a must-get was that it contained the entire fourth revised draft of the screenplay for A New Hope (it was the first time I had seen the Episode IV subtitle...even though I bought this book AFTER seeing The Empire Strikes Back).  The screenplay I read included scenes that were later edited out of the final film (mainly scenes on Tatooine focusing a bit on Luke's life there and introducing Biggs Darklighter.  Another deleted scene -- later restored for the Special Edition 20 years later -- introduced Jabba the Hutt...he would have been very different in look and demeanor from the final Jabba, but at least he was there.  Some of these scenes appear both in the novelization (make that ALL) and in the Radio Drama.<br />The other attractive thing of this book was the amazing artwork. It ranges from pre-production paintings, costume concepts, actual photos, storyboards, and poster art.  It even has a section devoted to spinoff art and some cute fan art, mostly drawn by small children.<br />The one flaw in the book is not content related but the choice of paper and binding. The pages are glossy, like those of a yearbook...but the glue that holds the pages to the binding was not strong enough to hold the pages together.  I went through three copies of this book in the time it was in print...I only looked at the last one ONCE and the pages still came loose.  Thus, out of 5 stars, I give this book 4.	2003-04-15

Never the hardcover, since that one is rare ... It is lovely to look at and the screenplay...the fourth draft, which has scenes that were cut in the first version and some adapted in the Special Edition, gives us more of the story as it would be presented in the novel and radio dramatization. It is a wonderful book to look at, ALTHOUGH my other copies had the weakness of falling apart even if one was careful when perusing it. Some problem with the binding, I imagine.  It is worth getting, though.	2003-04-02

Yes, it is an Expanded Universe novel and if you haven't read any of the previous &quot;further adventures of...&quot; novels, newcomers will not get any of the references to other works (such as Dave Wolverton's &quot;Courtship of Princess Leia,&quot;  Timothy Zahn's Grand Admiral Thrawn trilogy, or Dark Horse Comics' Dark Empire series, all of which are alluded to here.  What makes this novel worth reading is the connection between the classic trilogy, expanded universe, and the current films.  The Force is with Tatooine Ghost!	2003-04-02
