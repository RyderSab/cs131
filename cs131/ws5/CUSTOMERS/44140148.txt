It may help you to find and learn characters that relate to specific character easily.   <br /> <br />At the beginning of the book is a list of radicals.   <br /> <br />The main characters are listed in alphabetical order under the name of that character in English, as in \\"arros\\", \\"ghost\\", \\"legs\\", etc. <br /> <br />Under the character for \\"arrow\\" are listed different chinese words that contain the character for \\"arrow\\". <br /> <br />Beside each Chinese character, there is pronounciation in pinyin as well as description of the meaning in English. <br /> <br />The words are listed from the smaller number of strokes toward the larger. <br /> <br />The presentation of the characters in this book provides yet another tool to memorize characters in respect to relevancy and association. <br /> <br />While this is considered to be a dictionary - I find it more useful just for learning different characters, rather than using the book as a dictionary.  As far as dictionaries go, my all time favorite is Wenlin (electronic dictionary) since you can also hear the pronounciation.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-27

It will be useful for a long time. <br /> <br />Beside the pinyin listing, you'll find both simplified Chinese characters, and complex characters - complex / traditional characters are in brackets.  Parts of speech and abbreviations related to the area where the word may be encountered (e.g. medicine, photography, etc) are also marked beside characters. <br /> <br />I'm so much in love with the Wenlin program, that I have to add a few words about the electronic version of this dictionary.  One advantage of Wenlin is that you can hear the words, phrases and entire sentences pronounced.  You can also enter text in pinyin, in Chinese characters, or in English.  It is very useful when you desire to translate the information you found on the Internet because you can just copy and paste the Chinese text, and while this program is not considered to be a translator - it will help you a great deal in that respect, too. <br /> <br />Other than that it will give you an assortment of lists related to the character or word - according to the frequency, stroke count, radicals and much more. It's totally awesome! <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-27

Now you learn to play expressions that deal with time - past tense, future tense.  You also learn how to construct more complex sentences, more measure words, and the appropriate word order.  <br /> <br />While, theoretically, you may go through each lesson only once and while you may feel to excited to find out what comes next, here and there you may want to stay with some lessons longer.   <br /> <br />Each lesson does review some of the previous material, but it's really an immerson into the language and constant exposure to the words that makes them stick.  If you just go through the lessons once, few months down the road, it may seem that some of what you have learned has evaporated, so it's good to keep on reviewing the lessons, until the words remain impressed upon your mind.   <br /> <br />Since Pimsleur doesn't teach you how to write, this may be a good time (if you haven't yet), to pick up additional program that will teach you how to write Chinese characters.  One such program is Easy Chinese Tutor, also available on amazon.com <br />	2004-10-27

Tyler doesn't offer any information on how to use the herbs - as a matter of fact, from the way he describes them, you'd be sure he never ever touched, or tasted any herb. If you're read this book, you'll discover that there's no point in using any herbs because there are only two categories for herbs in this book: they either fall in the category of worthless or deadly. <br /> <br />Tyler does his best to downplay or completely disparage the effectiveness of every single herb mentioned, and when he is unable to prove that the particular herb is ineffective, then he states that even though the herb was empirically effective, there is no sufficient research to back it up.  <br /> <br />The book is basically loaded with information on why you should not bother using any of the herbs listed in this book - either because in Tyler's opinion they are ineffective or they could be dangerous. And for the herbs that have been proven effective and were in use for centuries, Tyler states how \\"pharmaceutical industry\\" lost interest in these herbs. Of course they lost interest - how would they have interest in herbs if they cannot patent that are available everywhere? On the other hand, because of people's interest in herbs, you'll find shelves at your drug store loaded with natural supplements.  Some people just don't want to poison themselves with pharmaceutical products (for that matter, you may want to check out compenium of pharamceutical products to find out how deadly side-effects of those can be). <br /> <br />If pharmaceutical industry can not make money, why would they still be interested? And to state that this book is free of commercialism, just \\"honest\\" herbal - what a joke! <br /> <br />For burdock, which is a blood purifier, Tyler further states \\"in spite of its long use as a folkloric remedy, no solid evidence existst that burdock exhibits any useful therapeutic activity.\\"  (Burdock happens to be one of the four herbs which have proven very effective in helping people heal innumerable diseases, cancer being one of them, because it does help to detoxify the body.) <br /> <br />About Chickweed, Tyler writes: \\"Despite the fact that it is prominently listed in almost every catalog of herbs currently available and also that many writers describe it as a valuable herb, I can think of no good reason to allow space to this worthless weed. ... Let's not waste any more time and space on the imagined medicinal value of this ineffective herb.\\" (On a personal note, chickweed is a popular herbal supplement for weight loss...) <br /> <br />And, well, I can only suggest that you invest your money in some other, decent and honest, herbal that actually offers some useful information regarding the use of herbs.  Do consult a genuine herbalist who is truly interested in helping people. Tyler's heart only beats for pharmaceutical industry. <br /> <br />	2004-10-27

By now you may begin to feel rather addicted to learning more Chinese.  By completing Level III, you have barely entered the waters of learing Chinese.  You have no problem communicating some of your basic needs and ideas, but you want to be able to do much more than that.  The hardest part may seem to be over - after all now you're totally confident in your ability to master Chinese if you keep going. <br /> <br />If you haven't yet picked up a book or a program to learn how to write Chinese - you may consider getting Easy Chinese Tutor CD, as well as some good dictionary (my absolute favorite is Wenlin's electronic dictionary - to a certain extent it can also function as a translator and best of all, you can not only see, but also hear the words).  By the time you get addicted to writing Chinese characters, you may also want to get NJStar program). <br /> <br />A good way to continue with reading and writing for serious students may be getting into the New Practical Chinese Reader (make sure you also get the tapes with the program). <br /> <br />Understanding Chinese movies may still be a rather challenging proposition, so as the next step you could get Rosetta Stone's Mandarin Chinese.	2004-10-27

That was a tremendous confidence booster that motivated me to keep going and the whole process of going through this program was so easy and enjoyable that it seemed entirely effortless.  It has transformed learning Chinese from impossibility into something easy to accomplish. <br /> <br />There are many other cheaper programs for learning Chinese, but unless you are familiar with pronouncing Chinese words, you'll only find yourself frustrated.  I tried some other programs before Pimsleur and was getting nowhere.  The prospect of learning Chinese still seemed impossible.   <br /> <br />In this program each word is broken into syllables which are easy to pronounce and then they are linked into words and sentences and another wonderful thing about this program is that it begins by teaching you some very useful things to say, so that no matter how many words you have learned, what you've learned you'll be able to use because it deals with fulfilling your basic needs and finding your way around.	2004-10-27

Erickson, Vol. 3)	Books	5	32	35	N	N	Ericksonian Hypnosis	The book explores some of Erickson's experiences with creating changes in the body through hypnosis, as in the following story:<br />\\"A normal 18-year-old girl was very distressed over the fact that she had not shown any evidence of breast development.<br />Her father was a physician, and at the age of 12 he had loaded her up with every kind of hormone possible. Yet there was no breast development of any sort; still none by 13, or 14, or 15. He finally quit the treatments and just gave up hope.<br />By the age of 18, the girl was making an extremely shizoid adjustment, withdrawing completely. She had an extremely disagreeable mother and she just hated her mother thoroughly.<br />So her doctor-father sent her to Erickson, asking him, \\"What can you do to keep my daughter from becoming schizophrenic?\\"<br />Well, it took Erickson about an hour to get the girl to tell him herself that she had no breast development whatsoever. She did agree, however, to go into a trance, and so he spent a couple more hours putting her into a deep trance very cautiously, very gently, very indirectly.<br />Then while she was in a deep trance state he explained to her how ignorant a man is about what a breast feels like; that he can't have any idea of how it feels to grow a breast; that he can't know what a breast feels like during a menstrual period; that he cannot really know what a woman's nipple feels like during menstruation.<br />And he spent a good deal of time presenting that sort of idea to her very repetitiously.<br />Next he explained in a similarly repetitious manner that since she was a girl, somehow or other she must have the right nerves, the right blood vessels with which to grow breasts.<br />He told her that when she was alone in the privacy of her room - she would someway, somehow, get a tremendous surging feeling in the breast area; and suddenly, somehow, her rudimentary nipples would feel warm, and she would have the feeling that something was happening.<br />He told hervery honestly that he didn't know what that feeling was, but that she could find out; and that she could get that tremendous surging feeling, that growing feeling or whatever it was, and then drift off to sleep very comfortably.<br />Erickson saw the girl once a week for two months, at which time she had very well developed breasts.\\"	2003-05-01

The process engages \\"active imagination\\" and its purpose is to transform one's negative unconscious projections.<br />The example involves the assistance of an Inner Guide (you may as well just ask the unconscious/superconscious to bring up the appropriate image or just let it surface into your awareness).<br />Say, for instance, that your neighbor is trying to poison your dog. Ask your Guide to take you to or bring you the image of that neighbor as you know him to be in the outer world. Then give that image permission to take its true form as it lives in you. Say that it turns into Dracula. The Dracula image is a picture of the energy in your that projects out from you onto your neighbor and gets him to try to poison your dog.<br />Call on the Transformational Energies  (these may be energies represented just as Light and Love, or angels, planetary forces, Tarot cards, etc.). If you are familiar with the Tarot cards, you can pick the images/energies of Sun, Fool and High Priestess.<br />Ask them to send their love into the figure (Dracula) to heal and transform it so that it reaches its highest possible form in you at this time. After they do this, say that the Dracula figure has turned into a King. Dracula and the King are the same energy, the King being its higher, more conscious form.<br />Ask the King what you have to do new in thought, action or behavior (having nothing to do with your neighbor), so that the energy the King represents in you will remain constant and not sink back into unconsciousness and its Dracula form.<br />When you have received this information, give the King energy form permission to enter your body. Feel what part of your body this energy lives in and where it radiates from. If the transformation is successful and you have really changed this part of yourself, the neighbor will either change dramatically or go out of your life immediately. Because you have changed your role needs and no longer need a dog poisoner in your reality, the neighbor's choices are to change as a role player for you or leave your reality.<br />Never work with images of known people from the outer world in the inner world. It tends to sustain rather than release negative unconscious projections. Always ask the image of the known outer world person that your Inner Guided brings you to take its true form AS IT LIVES AS AN ENERGY WITHIN YOU. This insures that you are, in fact, working on an aspect of yourself.<br />You can go to images of everyone you know and ask each of these outer world figures to take its true form as it lives in you. Here you will get the images of what you are projecting on each of them. It's both fascinating and revealing to do this and to discover just what we are projecting on those people we love best or least.\\"	2003-05-01

Victims of Brocq's disease develop a thick, horny covering over their skin that resembles the scales of a reptile.  The skin can become so hardened and rigid that even the slightest movement will cause it to crack and bleed. <br />Brocq's disease was incurable until 1951 when a sixteen-year-old boy with an advanced case of the affliction was referred as a last resort to a hypnotherapist named A.A. Mason at the Queen Victoria Hospital in London.  Mason discovered that the boy was a good hypnotic subject and could easily be put into a deep state of trance.<br />While the boy was in trance, Mason told him that his Brocq's disease was healing and would soon be gone.  Five days later the scaly layer covering the boy's left arm fell off, revealing soft, healthy flesh beneath.  By the end of tend days the arm was completely normal.<br />Mason and the boy continued to work on different body areas until all of the scaly skin was gone.  The boy remained symptom-free for at least five years, at which point Mason lost touch with him.<br />This is extraordinary because Brocq's disease is a genetic condition, and getting rid of it involves more than just controlling autonomic processes such as blood flow patterns and various cells of the immune system.  It means tapping into the masterplan, the DNA programming itself.  So, it would appear that when we access the right strata of our beliefs, our minds can override even our genetic makeup.\\"	2003-05-01

The book explores different phenomena, some rather rare and unusual, as in the following excerpt:<br />\\"Thurston quoted a sister Margherita Cortonesi:<br />\\"On one occasion, among others, when [Sister Veronica] being in a trance state was reciting her Office alternately with some invisible being, she was observed gradually to stretch out until the length of her throat seemed to be out of all proportion in such a way that she was altogether much taller than usual.  We, noticing this strange occurrence, looked to see if she was raised from the ground, but this, so far as our eyes could tell, was not the case.  So, to make sure, we took a yard-measure and measured her height, and afterwards when she had come to herself we measured her again, and she was at least a span (ten inches or more) shorter.

Because such phenomena were not thought to be marks of holiness, they were noted simply because they were unusual.<br />I include such phenomena in this discussion because they indicate the body's responsiveness to altered states of mind.  When consciousness is released from some of its ordinary constraints, whether in ecstasies or dissociated states, ligaments and muscles are sometimes liberated too.:de such phenomena in this discussion because they indicate the body's responsiveness to altered states of mind.

Even though I knew the universal principles and was using them for many years before I stumbled upon this book, every once in a while I'd forget to apply them.  This book came to me at a time in my life when I was facing a number of challenges.  After 2 - 3 days with the help of this wonderful book, all the problems dissolved, my faith was renewed and the miracles began to happen all around me, and maybe even more importantly - inside of me.  This book helped me get back on the \\"right track\\", to the path of wonders and miracles.  My deepest gratitude goes to Ms. Florence Scovel Shinn for I felt her loving hands stretching through the words in this book and pulling me (and my life) out of a ditch.	2002-03-17

These books are my all-time favorites.  Over the past 15 years I have purchased several sets of these books and tapes and shared these ideas with countless people.  Some found them interesting, some inspiring, some didn't want to part with them, and some became obsessed with the ideas presented in these books as much as I have.  What can I say, these books did change my life.<br />I understand that for a lot of people the ideas presented in these books seem totally outrageous and that some people try to discredit them looking for information that will prove that the adventures presented in these books are all fabricated. To a lot of people it is very disconcerting when their ideas become challenged and they'll fight to prove that their limiting beliefs are the sound ones even if those beliefs are actually crippling their lives and taking the joy out of it.  Whatever we choose to believe, we'll always look for ways to validate our beliefs and we'll always find what we are looking for (proof).<br />Even though we may or may not be able to prove whether the stories in these books are factual, we call all apply the principles presented.  The main idea of these books is that man is limited or unlimited according to the thoughts and beliefs he chooses.  And even if your main goal in life is not to master the ability to walk on water, walk through fire, teleport, or spiritualize your body, you can still use the principles in this book to get as far as your imagination and faith will allow you.  Then, if you ever get bored with the mundane life, if you ever begin to wonder if there's anything more to life, you can get ideas here that will keep you busy on developing yourself, growing, expanding and actualizing your potential as long as you so desire.  And then, if you are really interested, you can find many other books that explore the same principles presented here to feed your mind, your imagination, and your passion for life.  <br />If you choose to apply the principlespresented in this book, instead of just reading the books once for entertainment, you will soon begin to experience events in your life that will serve as a proof that these principles are valid and applicable in your life wherever you are right now and your belief will grow stronger and who knows, maybe one day you decide to imagine for yourself what was previously unthinkable.  Maybe one day you give yourself a chance to surprise yourself allowing the power that is locked within you to come out and express itself in all its glory.  Then you'll feel grateful that you found these books - even if they seemed far-out when you first picked them up.	2002-03-08

A lot of people can become instantly taller, an inch or so, just by \\"walking tall\\" (instead of slumped), by changing posture.  Exercises in this book, and for that matter any stretching exercises, jumps, etc.) can work even better for you if you engage the power of your imagination, belief and expectation.  Nutrition by itself may not make you taller, however it may support your goal.<br />The outstanding results in height increase are based on nothing less than your burning desire, belief and expectation.  If you hold onto the belief that you can't grow, you won't.  If you believe that it is reasonable to settle for 1 - 2 inches, and that's all that you expect - that's what you'll experience.  If you desire to grow more and are open to the belief that yes, you can do it now, and you expect it to happen - than you are greatly increasing your chances of success.<br />The claims that you can achieve outstanding results only by doing physical exercises and consuming food and supplements that release human growth hormone, may sound outrageous - if that's all you do.  If you'd realize the effect that your mind has over your body, what previously seemed outrageous and impossible may actually inspire you to engage your imagination to the fullest - and experience results beyond what you dreamed to be possible for you before.<br />Your body changes all the time (within a year, about 98% of the cells of your body are completely different - including your skeleton - and you actually have a completely new body) according to the blueprint you hold in your subconscious.  And this blueprint changes according to thoughts, emotions, images and beliefs you entertain on daily basis.  You may find scientific articles on mind-body connection and the influence of your thoughts and emotions, your imagination and your expectations on your body and on the release of hormones in your body...<br />A lot of changes in your body pass by unnoticed on a day-to-day basis, and it may not be immediatley obvious to you just how much your imagination affects your body.  If you'd like an obvious example, imagine for a moment holding a big yellow juicy lemon, holding it in your hand, then slicing it and biting into it - the lemon juice spurting all over - and eating it.  If you really got into the experience, you must have noticed the difference in your mouth.  Your mouth watered, didn't it? And where is the lemon?  Only in your imagination and it's your imagination that activated your salivary glands.<br />Perhaps, growing taller with the use of hypnosis (engaging your imagination) does not fit into your belief system.  Then, if you really want to break the limits of what you believed was possible for you, you need to re-examine your beliefs system.  If it helps you to grow as tall as you'd like - keep it.  If it doesn't, change it.  You will always find abundant \\"proof\\" for any belief system you choose to entertain, when you begin to look for it.  If you'd like to learn more about changing your beliefs...	2002-02-25

While the exercises and proper nutrition are certainly good for your health, it is unlikely that you will increase your height unless you engage the power of your imagination.  <br />The author points out that \\"the most powerful way to grow is to believe you can do it\\", and this is absolutely true, yet he does not provide much information about this crucial element (that's why I gave it only four stars).<br />In 1960's, Dr. Milton Erickson, a well known and respected hypnotherapist helped a 20-year-old man to GROW 12 INCHES IN HEIGHT IN THE SPAN OF ONE YEAR - with hypnosis. <br />(...) <br />If you are already using Robert Grand's program, you can find out how to use hypnosis to accelerate your progress.	2002-02-25
