There are probably a million books that fit this classification, with most of them falling short of solid, landing much closer to middle-of-the-road or missing the road entirely. This is the first Updike book I've ever read and it won't be the last. In the enormous world of books, that's saying something. To me, Updike has a quality many authors do not. Defining that quality is left as an exercise to the reader, since my attempts to put it into words leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br />The book is a general story of a general man in a not-so-general relationship. The circumstance are not outstanding nor are they mundane. They are interesting to read about, regardless. While the story does not entail a common set of events a most have experienced, many of the themes are real enough to make the book easy to relate to. The topic matter is real, and you don't need to suspend disbelief to get much out of it. <br /> <br />Whenever I review books, I attempt to give the review reader my take on what I found both good and bad in the pages. I'm not sure there's much of a downside here, but I'll do my best. I suppose the ordinary sense of the story does little to separate it from a lot of other \\"real life\\" books on the market today. At the same time, you might look at that as a testament to the strong core of the book. Still, the story offers no real insight to the reader, which is why this is a good book, not a great one. Other than that, it's hard for me to find anything to complain about with this book. <br /> <br />I enjoy Updike's style and the fact he is so in touch with the real American, or human, to be more appropriate. So many hours of our lives are spent in these day-to-day scenarios that much of the subject matter is topical and easy to relate to. On the other hand, most of us don't end up in these types of stories. Still, it's easy to identify with in some ways. As they say, sex sells. Of course, itisn't that easy, since that's not really the crux of the book. <br /> <br />Adult themes are too often ignored in books these days, giving way to the endless vacuum of purported children's needs or the inane quest for love. So few books touch on the search to fill the void that burns within people. This book does almost nothing to answer the question of what that burning is, or how one might go about quenching the fire. It does, however, give the reader plenty to think about as the story explores a course of action that results from a set of choices, and what happens to the people surrounding those choices. <br /> <br />Interesting and well written. Recommended.	2005-10-13

Well, a friend whose opinion I generally trust recommended it to me about 10 years ago. Yeah, a lot changes in 10 years. And it bears to reason that the kinds of books we were reading then aren't exactly the books we're reading now. At least for me this is true. For about 8 years this book sat in my bookcase, waiting patiently to be read. By chance, I picked it up after all this time. In the end, I guess that was the turning point. The story had been so promising until I started to actually read it. <br /> <br />Mired in a mundane story of a generic nuclear family, the only thing unique about this book is that the family is a family of freaks - literally. Each family member has some kind of genetic mutation which allows them to be an element in a traveling circus. These mutations were brought about due to experimentations by the parents. I'll leave the gory details to the book, if you so choose to pick it up, which I don't recommend. <br /> <br />When I initially finished the book I thought it was good enough, if not spectacular. In the grand scheme of things that's what you're going to get when you read random books - some good, some bad, but the vast majority in between. After some time to think about it, this lies more to the bad side that in between, a sentiment that an old coworker once remarked about when he said, \\"What happened to good literature? All the kids these days are reading crap like Geek Love.\\" This was 8 years ago, which sparked a reply of, \\"I wonder what's wrong with Geek Love,\\" to myself. Now I know. <br /> <br />If only I had known before. The book is short enough that it doesn't waste away too much of your time. So it's got that going for it, which is nice. And the pages turn fast enough, I suppose. But at best, it can be labeled as, \\"You could waste your time in worse ways.\\" In the end, this book was ultimately a waste of time for me. <br /> <br />To get slightly more into the book, the story deals with a series of family squabbles that you might have seen at some point growing up watching 8 is Enough, or The Partridge Family or The Brady Bunch. The story doesn't end happily in 30 minutes, like those shows did. But the issues aren't really any different. Just more adult and, well, freakish in nature. You give a teenager with an insecurity complex webbed feet, and we're still talking about a teenager with an insecurity complex. I probably thought many of the people I went to high school with probably had webbed feet at the time anyway. <br /> <br />The ending of the story is, in my opinion, awful. What was a mildly entertaining and unremarkable book turned towards the dumb and unbelievable at the end. Such is the errant narrative of the text, I suppose, having been crafted by someone trying to take a generic story of family strife and sell more books by giving the people physical deformities and putting them in a carnival. As a literary element, the book as a whole leaves a lot to be desired in so, so many ways. <br /> <br />In any event, not much to see here.	2005-10-06

I enjoy her books and, as a man married to a Taiwanese woman, find words hit home more than the average white American male would tend to experience. Having said that, I feel The Hundred Secret Sense is too similar to The Joy Luck Club in it's words, difficulties, and general feel. While both books are well worth the read, I did not find enough variance between Joy Luck and Secret Senses. I admit this may be unfair, as each book should be taken in a vacuum. But life isn't a vacuum, and one cannot be read without influencing the other. <br /> <br />I should reiterate I did like the book. Several times it made me laugh out loud, something I don't find myself doing all that often while reading on public transportation. The book is easy to read, as she is great in putting words together and writing stories that come from the heart, loaded with meaning that straddle her Chinese and American roots. Her themes are ones I can identify with, at least as far as I can identify with my wife's having experienced much of the same culture clash I believe Tan has experienced. <br /> <br />But the book isn't perfect, by any stretch. Much of the time the story wasn't clear in the direction it was taking. Often it flailed along, not having a true course of action in it's flow. Many of the chapters were thrown together, as if they were observations Tan made in her daily life. I'm not sure what Tan was getting at with this book. Her reliance on unexplainable and randomly adhered to Chinese lore is non-committal at best. If one is to draw anything from that lore, it would be foolish, as the main character doesn't really believe any of it. Perhaps the message is of a confused Chinese-American woman confronted with the realities of life. But then, life is a myriad of confusion regardless of your nationality and country of origin. <br /> <br />Perhaps the book is a manifestation of Tan's difficulty in dealing with the seemingly absurd statements that occasionally come from the Chinese culture - statements such as proclaiming a ghost spirit was using them as a medium last week, or the reason a person is fat is because they have a pair of Buddha gods living in their stomach. I know the feeling, having heard these non-sequiter comments for the better part of 9 years from various in-laws, including the 2 mentioned above. Still, the feeling I get from this book is similar to the one I got from Lost in Translation, where the crux of the story is to say that she is confused, and wallowing in that confused sadness is what she intends to do. <br /> <br />Perhaps it is my preference in books such as Tom Robbins novels that leads me to have difficulty identifying with the main character here. Instead of attempting to move forward, she sidles down in her sorrow more often than not. Then again, it would be far from fair to say Robbins' characters resemble anyone you might meet in real life, where Tan's certainly do. <br /> <br />Even though I read Joy Luck Club over a year ago, it was still too soon to read Hundred Secret Senses. If you haven't read either, I suggest the Joy Luck Club first, then wait a few years to buy this one. While it is good, and I plan on reading more Amy Tan novels in the future, it did not resonate with me as much as her more popular book did. Easy to read, yet repetitive in nature, the book dabbles along, entertaining but then dragging for a while before diving head first into the mysticism that permeates the confused situation the main character finds herself in.	2005-09-27
US	52559350	R14UC3F8KL60VZ	0375714499	38005795	Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media	Books	3	7	12	N	N	Decent But Lacking in Focus	There's no other way to summarize this book for me other than to say that this is tough book to read. A meager 300 pages (in book terms, that's meager enough), this book still took me months of passive reading to get through. While not entirely a fair statement, it is somewhat representative of how thick this book can get at times. While imparting the reader with a perspective that they may not have previously had, it also wastes a lot of space saying the same thing over and over again. By the end, the book isn't saying anything you haven't read 12 (or more) times before. <br /> <br />To summarize, the book is an in-depth discussion of the media's role in shaping public opinion, shaping the news, and how it fails to live up to the commonly accepted position as an objective observation element. I don't think the average person denies that media has gone beyond the bounds of basic objective reporter. However, this takes it to a whole new level. Whether or not you agree is up to you, if you choose to read the book. <br /> <br />The book starts by describing the basic foundation of the media. Specifically, it details how content can be shaped by ownership, reader consumption and/or desired consumption, income considerations, and sourcing. By \\"sourcing\\", I refer to the contention that the vast majority of media sources are government feeds, either overtly or discreetly. Given the resource constraints of most media outlets, government propaganda is an easy way to get, at the very least, one side of any story. Even ignoring Chomsky's tendency of overbearance, it does certainly beg the question of media objectivity. <br /> <br />The remainder of the book is story after story showing examples of the media catering, willingly or not, to what the government wants them to say. Due to deadlines and limited resources, government officials are the easiest and cheapest way to cite a \\"reliable\\" source, where the reliability of said source brings into question the idea of conflict ofinterest. In the end, there probably is no conflict, since media outlets are geared to make money, as opposed to the misconception that media institutions exist to seek the truth. The government's goal of forwarding their agenda does not run counter to the media outlet's goal. This key concept is forgotten in most attacks against the media. <br /> <br />All of these issues (and more) are brought to the attention of the reader in great detail. Having said that, this book is tough to read, often times bogging down in poorly constructed paragraphs that plod along with no real direction. The book is not written to be read, per se, so much as it stands as a representation of the author's ideas which make it to the pages trough whatever words came to mind while writing it. There's a big discrepancy here, as many ideas of the book are lost in the sea of imprecise prose. While some may be able to ignore this in light of the truth it attempts to bring to light, I am not. A book needs to be both potent and readable for me to really enjoy it. <br /> <br />What this translates to is such. The book is a fair read but I found it difficult to pick it up for more than 2-3 pages at a sitting. Anything more than that resulted in my losing attention. Repeated attempts to consume greater portions of the book only resulted in drowsiness and lack of focus. For me, it became a burden to try and finish the book. In the end, that's how I rate a book. Is it easy to ascertain what the writer has to say, or do I find myself struggling to concentrate? <br /> <br />A decent book that needs to be read in small doses.	2005-09-25
US	52559350	R1VTUGXFJKD9W0	0140277447	803730078	The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II	Books	3	13	24	N	N	Chang's Version of a Brutal History Forgotten	The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang is a good book, containing seemingly well-researched information and raising questions which make you think hard about the planet we live on and the character of the people there - for better or worse. Given that, this book falls into a trap many books detailing tragic moments of history fall into. Namely, the pages begin to say the same thing over and over, each chapter telling the same sordid story the previous one did, sometimes in a slightly different light. <br /> <br />The book stands on it's own as a worthy element in forgotten history. Very reminiscent of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown, the core of this book is well-justified and well-researched, no matter how vehemently modern defenders of those past actions try to proclaim otherwise. The book lends a heavy perspective in one's attempt to try and understand the human mind and how deranged it can be. No matter how low you believe humanity can go, works like this serve to show that it really can get worse. Truly a forgotten holocaust, this book should be required reading for anyone interested in WWII history. <br /> <br />Chang sheds light on this tragedy in wide angles, showing what people during this time period had to endure. It also stands as a sad precursor to the Cultural Revolution that would fill the void of the Japanese after the war ended. Not only for the WWII buff, anyone interested in Chinese history should take the time to read this as well. The information here is well worth the read. <br /> <br />But the book fails to say anything new after the mid-way point. Chang paints a powerful picture in the first half of the book, then runs out of anything new to say. Again, very much like Dee Brown, the book trails on, telling the same story of the same people over and over. Nothing new comes of it, and the book suffers for it. I'm unsure what the point of this endeavor is, other than to drive home an already well-made point. The result is a slow-moving, redundant second half of text. <br /> <br />I don't think the book loses *too* much because of it, but there is an element lacking as the book fades to the end. After the charged beginning, the book soon brought me to a point where I wondered why I was reading any further. I had read and understood the message at the start. But I soon questioned why the same message was being proffered continuously in the following chapters. To boot, the text seemed to become more emotionally charged as the book wore on, and objectivity started to morph into subjectivity as no substantially new information was brought to light. <br /> <br />Those interested in a light read should certainly not pick this up. Those looking to learn something about Chinese History or WWII should. While this is not \\"sleepy afternoon\\" reading material, it's well written and not a heavy or thick book by any means. Chang is a writer who researches the subject very well, as opposed to a historian who wants to be a writer. There's a big difference, and her's is the easier book to read in terms of turning pages. Perhaps her lack of historical objectivity clouds the later part of the book, but overall it's worth the read.	2005-09-16
US	52559350	R39KI9JRPRVI9S	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	3	30	37	N	N	Decent, But Highly Overrated	Placed firmly between fact and fiction, the DaVinci Code by Dan Brown attempts to draw the reader in with a loose tapestry which spans both, and tries to draw on each element to keep your attention. While the book is intriguing on one level, it is deficient in another. It draws you in for one reason, then casts you out for another. It starts fast, and finishes faster. The story moves in 2 different planes, one of them satisfying and the other a myriad of absurdity. In the end, neither aspect is really all that satisfying because they have to coexist together to form the book as a whole.<br /><br />I read this book because my mother bought it for me. She bought it for me because it was the rage at the time. She read it, her friend read it, her friend's friend read it, and so on. I don't question how or why a book ends up on top of my \\"to read\\" pile. I just read it, thankful for the opportunity to walk down a road I might not have otherwise walked down. This is exactly that, a book I never would have read left to my own devices.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. But it is nowhere near as good as general perception paints it to be. Frankly, I think this is one of the most overrated books in recent memory. I rarely read bestsellers because I think the general reading public tends towards trash novels that aren't worth the time spent reading them. Is this one of those novels? I can't say that. But it's not a 5-star book either. It's a decent book which intrigued me in terms of historical perspective but which suffered mightily in trying to tie it together. This would have been better served as a sort of Dummy's Guide to Biblical Intrigue, or something along those lines.<br /><br />The book's dual parts come from the historical discussion on religion, combined with a fictional story about a riddle which needs to be figured out. [...]<br /><br />I have to imagine there will be a sharp polarization regarding opinions on this book based on religious affiliation, or lack thereof. This tired debate should not be how you approach this book. It is a work of fiction, first and foremost, and should be regarded as such. Despite the fact that Dan Brown states all the documents and rituals in the book are factual, a token investigation shows these claims are flimsy, at best. Throughout the book, Brown toys with fact and fiction so much that one isn't sure where the line is drawn between them. In the end, it's hard not to see Brown as self-important, since he is essentially dubbing his book as the Holy Grail, in a very tangible way. I'm not sure he intended that, at least not overtly. But that's what his claim ultimately is.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the religious history is intriguing. This is so true it's easy to find yourself fully engaged in the book, regardless of the pure fictional aspect of it. The \\"code\\" keeps you interested. Yet in the end, it lacks the literary punch to keep you hooked throughout, as the believability factor creeps towards absurdity as the pages dwindle. This is the core of the fictional piece of the book. As it winds down, we see the story fade into a weak, mediocre pulpit in which Brown uses to preach his message.<br /><br />The payoff to the novel is disappointing, since we don't get much of a crescendo to either story. The ending is a distasteful combination of the predicable and anti-climatic. You're left assuming Brown couldn't tie it together, and was forced to patch things up as best he could so the story could end. For many people, I believe the intrigue of the religious aspect is so strong it allows them to overlook the weak ending and poor fiction in the book. Personally, I find it very difficult to allow the weak ending to be overshadowed by the excellent opening, an opening which was left ultimately unrewarding.<br /><br />Despite all the criticisms, I think it's a good book that *some* people should read. As I see it, the potential problem lies in the thought that people will have problems differentiating fact and fiction, and the book will serve as another disinformation tool which is no better than the church which it, in part, attempts to expose. The story, characters, and dialog are enjoyable until they get inane, the layers of involvement degrade, and the conclusion derails. Still, I did enjoy my time reading it.<br /><br />In all, a good book for those who are easily able to differentiate between fact and fiction, who can assess the book on its own merits without allowing the loaded fictitious scenarios to sway them either way, and for those people (like me) who are likely uninformed about the subject matter it tries to uncover, namely the details of the Holy Grail and the religious history surrounding it.differentiating fact and fiction, and the book will serve as another disinformation tool which is no better than the church which it, in part, attempts to expose.

From the clichd moment I picked it up, the book had me hooked. Granted, the book didn't hook for me long. Due to its small size, it took a mere 2 days to get from start to finish, hardly enough time to appreciate the excellent work manifested in the pages here.    It's probably fair to say I will always be drawn to well-written books about nature and the outdoors, and man's endeavors into it. See my reviews on Winterdance and Magnetic North to bear witness to this fact. Having said that, I believe it's also fair to say this book (and the other 2 mentioned) are tales that most people will enjoy, regardless of your relationship with nature & the outdoors.    The story in a nutshell, without giving too much away, is about a young kid who treks \\"into the wild\\" in an attempt to find himself and get away from society and its endlessly vapid and decadent existence. It is a common theme of escape & exploration of many youths, even if the path he takes is not. What transpires is  a trek, as the title suggests, into the wild, the details of which are left as an exercise to the proverbial reader. It's well worth the read, to say the least.    The book is fascinating, perplexing, and hard to put down. Krakaur is very good writer who delves completely into the material at hand, fully embracing the details of the story. Because of that, I believe this is his best work to date. His strong desire to discover the 5 Ws about a tale come through on the pages, his passion easily discernable in his words.    On the other hand, I think the story suffers because Krakaur so strongly embraces this lifestyle and the main character's choices. As a result, he sometimes gives more leeway than he probably should, explaining things away with a line of reason that often doesn't follow from the details presented. To an extent, there are traces of deification in Krakaur's tale, and this detracts from the book for sure.     I won't say these things are a concrete detriment to the flow of the book as a whole. Perhaps it would be more accurate to call them wisps of doubt clouds that float through an otherwise excellent story. Krakaur isn't a dreamer. He acknowledges people make mistakes and that nobody is perfect. While his perspective may not lie in the center of the double yellow line of objectivity, he admits as much, never trying to hide the fact.    In all, the book is a great read, and quick at that. I think it will appeal to a wide range of readers and does a great job asking and (usually) answering questions which come up through the course of the narrative. He explores various details of those 5 Ws to the point of visiting some of the same places the main character did, in an attempt to experience the elements he was writing about. It comes out in the pages, developing into an easily readable book which tells a fascinating story of an interesting individual.    Well worth it, highly recommended.	2005-08-24
US	52559350	R3J3GQQJUFVB6W	0449211479	241253921	The Source	Books	3	10	29	N	N	The Source of Many Pages	The Source, like any Michener book I suppose, is enormously immense. The words \\"enormously immense\\" may indeed be redundant. But this book, and I'll go ahead and guess any other book he has written, deserves the redundancy. Hey, for all of the redundancy he makes his readers endure, it's a mere trifle to add 1 extra word to make a point. The point again? That this book is one of the biggest books I have ever read.<br /><br />The word \\"big\\" should be quantified. One way to measure a book is by pages. This book, I measure in train time. I take the train to work every day, and I average roughly a book every 4 days. This book took me no less than 13 work days, and 4 weekend days to finish. Towards the end, I was reading nothing but this book. I usually read other material at home, before bed, etc. By the end of this, I read nothing else. It was the Source, non-stop.<br /><br />Some people may interpret this as me saying that I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down. To the contrary, this book was good, and nothing more than that. It's a decent book that makes you think. But it's not good enough to make you want to read it non-stop. Likewise, it's not bad enough to quit on, despite it's immense size and decided lack of dialog that allows you to get through pages faster. No, by the end I just wanted to be done with it. So I put everything else on hold, and dedicated myself to this book and this book alone, because I wanted to be done with it so badly.<br /><br />Having gotten that out of the way, in a very Michener-like fashion, it's a decent book. I'm not sure I can overstate how long you're going to have to work to finish it. I'm sure this is nothing new to Michener readers. But I feel it is my duty to warn everyone who might embark on this author for the first time. Readers beware! While the subject matter surely begs for a lot of attention, Michener drones on with the mundane, reiterating facets of history over and over in small parables that could stand alone as novellas themselves. Chapters here are epic. Points are as frequent as springs in the desert. Combine the 2 and you have a lot of bleary-eyed mornings on my way to Penn Station.<br /><br />On the plus side, all of these words do lend the reader to think extensively about the Jewish faith. The trials and tribulations - or at least some reasonable stab at such in these pages - give the reader loads to think about in terms of what has helped shape the culture and religion as it is today. Through the absurdly difficult history of Judaism, we see a resilient religion withstand various slings and arrows, so to speak.<br /><br />Of course, this is all speculation, which is the inherent problem with any historical novel. Historical novels are allowed to play with reality, to play with facts in an effort to fool the reader into thinking that various people or scenes are true, when in fact they are almost total fabrications based on vague histories or unproven lore. Expecting your average reader to identify this is probably a stretch in one's faith in comprehension. To boot, Michener takes far too much literary license in this book, and it reads as a dual-genre book which waffles variously between history and fiction.<br /><br />The weakest link of the book, I thought, was the shallow welding together of the historical chapters in the telling of the modern day story of The Tell, or the excavation of a site that serves as the basis for the book's various historical ramblings. The modern story is out-and-out dumb, with characters who do not represent anything I would call realistic in this day and age. Of course, the story is archaeological Israel in the 1960's, but still, we're not talking 1549 here.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book given it's volume and low payoff-to-page ratio. It's a decent book, and if you have a free month any time soon, I'd say go ahead, give it a shot. But if time is of the essence, and for me it certainly is, I'd say to move on to another Michener book. I have not read any of his others but I am told that Chesapeake and Poland are very good. Again, reader beware! Certainly you could do worse. But given the amount of time you're to put into this, I think you could also do better.to another Michener book. I have not read any of his others but I am told that Chesapeake and Poland are very good. Again, reader beware! Certainly you could do worse.

When a friend of mine told me I should read this, I hesitated. Later when that same friend lent me the book, I had little choice but to actually read it. Imagine my surprise to find that it is definitely not your run of the mill Stephen King book. By no means does it fit the stereotype I expected based on his other works. Eyes of the Dragon is a fantasy about a king, his kingdom, and his sons. Those expecting a standard Stephen King scream-fest might be disappointed by this - then again maybe not. Considering I generally do not read his books, I quite enjoyed the change of pace. <br /> <br />The book is well written, and fairly easy to get in to. I won't say he's an experienced or particularly talented fantasy writer. That would be unfair to the genre. But he does hold his own, managing to maintain the reader's interest as he constructs the story, with kings and sons and wizards and dragons, and a series of unfortunate events that befall our hero. While the certainly knows what will happen as the story progresses, there is no lack of enjoyment getting there. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there isn't much fantasy depth here. King isn't experienced in the genre and it shows. The plot and characters are trite, about what you would expect by any author new to fantasy. What King lacks in his fantasy writing depth, he makes up for with his ability to put words on a page. I don't think that entirely atones for the lack of fantasy cohesiveness in the novel, but it helps. <br /> <br />All in all I think this is a good book. Those who love hard-core fantasy or those who are looking for a standard Stephen King thriller will likely be disappointed. Other than that group of readers, I think the book caters to a wide audience. Most people will probably enjoy what this book has to offer. <br /> <br />Solid read, recommended.	2005-08-06

No, the reason it took me 3 years to read this book is because it's just not very good. As excellent as Lies My Teacher Told Me was, this was equally bad. <br /> <br />The book is a collection of small essays about various roadside memorials, or statues, or other historical tidbits that adorn the United States landscape. Loewen goes on to expound how incorrect all of them are, in the process suggesting that - now get this - there is racism in this country. Nothing in this book is eye-opening, by a long shot. While some essays do shed some interesting light on our history, the majority of these essays can be summed up by saying that white people have treated black people and Indians poorly. What a surprise. In his next book we may find out that the sun rises in the East. <br /> <br />I'm utterly baffled how anyone can give this book 5 stars. This is a 2 star book which narrowly escapes the fate of a single star only because some of the history here is enlightening, to an extent. The vast majority deals with the deep south and it's predilection towards racism. <br /> <br />In any book which the author doesn't have enough material to sufficiently back his claim, he will resort to such tactics as telling one side of the story or failing to give the full history of the situation. Loewen does both, often times leaving the essay a bare skeleton of what it might have been; leading the attentive reader wondering why things don't seem to add up on the pages of his text. <br /> <br />I feel like the motivating force of this book was to make money, and little else. Perhaps there was a drive to create controversy. But the book is so tame that it can hardly do that. The pages are mostly a chore to get through, as evidenced by the 3 year period it took me to get through it. Truth be told, itmay have been sitting on my night stand for 4 years. Either way, I found it dreadfully difficult to pick it up most days. <br /> <br />Entirely not worth it.	2005-07-27

I don't think you can say any more, or less I suppose, than that. The story isn't fascinating - those with even a cursory familiarity with Native American history will recognize the narrative here as one of many parallel stories that befell the lands west of the Mississippi in the 19th century. Rayner tires to spice it up by adding himself to the narrative, but it does nothing to aid what otherwise is a sad historic tale. <br /> <br />In this book, Rayner is a struggling writer who sporadically imagines himself observing Northern California, where a group of American Indians led by a man named Captain Jack embark in a standoff with American soldiers in what can only be called a case of history repeating itself. As I said above, the historical path is well worn, the results are well known, the outcome is the same sad story that it will always be, no matter who tells the tale. Rayner spends a weekend in his own house, attempting to fantasize himself with these Indians in their final days. <br /> <br />The book is not riveting. It doesn't call you back for more. It neither starts nor ends with a flourish. There is generally nothing remarkable about the book. It may be the case that the Rayner in the book is the same Rayner that wrote it. Perhaps this is an autobiographical account of how he got through the hurdle of writing a book. I don't know. Additionally, I don't know why I bought this book in the first place - more than likely it was recommended by a friend, which only goes to show why books are a highly personal matter. For me, it simply wasn't worth it; not even close. <br /> <br />It's not a terrible book so much as it's mundane and plodding. The low number of pages translates to a surprisingly long read. The end of the story cannot get here fast enough. I found it to be worse than a flat-out awful book, because it's not bad enough to put down after 50 pages. When you finish, it's hard to say you got much of anything out ofit, other than a handful of smiles, at best. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, you're better off reading something else. A below average book.	2005-07-26

What I expect from these actions, I cannot say. But finally, my persistence has paid off. With this book, Jordan has gotten partially back on track with what he did in his first 2 books. Yes, I realize that we're now on book 7, and I wasted a lot of time on those 4 books in between. But hey, sometimes we need to read something that keeps the pages turning. Jordan certainly does that, and if you pick this book up you're in for another 850 of them - pages, that is. <br /> <br />Several of the negative traits you've come to expect in Jordan's previous books seem to have dried up in this one. At the time he wrote it, he must have taken some of the criticism to heart and done away with the gratuitous breast flashes and idiotic male-female dynamic that was a detriment to the narrative. This book is devoid of that, which makes the read an improvement over the last one by leaps and bounds. <br /> <br />Still, the conclusion is weak. The ending is something you know is going to happen before you buy the book. More importantly, the manner in which he writes it is weak. Even though we can be reasonably sure what will happen when the book ends, it still has the potential to be interesting. Sadly, that is not the case here. In the overall scheme of things, the conclusion is a mere wisp of 5 pages in a cloud of a story. The rest of the book was decent, even if he did keep one negative trait of not coming any closer to tying the series up. <br /> <br />As I said in the last review, and the review before that, if you've read this far you're probably going to read the next one. There's no point quitting after 6, since one assumes the end must be near and book 7 was the best in a while. I'm not sure it deserves the \\"international bestseller\\" acclaim it gets. But it's a decent read, which helped make the train ride home every night go by faster than it normally would have. For that, it's probably worth the price. <br /> <br />Might as well keep on reading, no need to stop now.	2005-06-24
US	52559350	R8QJZMS17N9X6	0609809512	657839683	A Year in Van Nuys	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Solidly Entertaining	This is a good - not great - book that generally entertains, but goes too far in an effort to keep the reader amused and interested. The author writes at a higher intelligence level than your typical best selling author does. The downside is that she knows it, and it effects her work. More importantly, however, is the prevalence of eye bag references that nearly made me throw this book in the trash, something I have never done in my life. Six weeks after having finished the book, I sit here editing this review with one prevailing thought in my head, the less-than-enjoyable eye bag references. <br /> <br />The book is presumably about a year in the life of the author. While I don't know how much resonance there is between her real life and what we read on the pages, you can tell there is some. There are too many passionate outbursts for all of this to be fiction. After all, what writer doesn't reveal some of their soul in the words they create? This is what makes it so real and easy to read. As someone once said somewhere, write what you know. But then, what if you know nothing? I digress. <br /> <br />The author clearly knows more than nothing and for the most part, the contents of what she does know are enjoyable to read. Some of the events in the book are resonant with things I've experienced in my own life, despite the fact that I'm a man. I'll go ahead and say the eye bags are *not* one of those things. Still, the struggle to be an author and her ultimate decision in that endeavor are thoughts close to many I have had before. Her final decision, entirely contrary to the fact she authored a book, is something I've also come to adopt. Maybe it this freedom has led her to this work? Again, I digress. <br /> <br />It's a refreshing book, light yet intelligent to a point. It's a quick and enjoyable read. You could certainly do a lot worse. What's more, it has diagrams for those slow on the uptake. All in all, it's generally entertaining and contains real-life insights that can be applied to life and used to learn a little about yourself. Well worth the time spent reading it.	2004-12-09
US	52559350	RX69H1JSKPGEY	156478214X	833071710	The Third Policeman	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Oddly Compelling	A dark, strange, yet wildly interesting book I found myself fascinated with, it's dark comedic words slowly meandering down a peculiar path that left me somewhat puzzled until the end. While not a mystery in the true sense of the word, the story remains enigmatic enough to keep you guessing what's happening on the pages before you. I much enjoyed reading this book. <br /> <br />The narrative could be a bit morbid for some, which is understandable. I won't go into the details of the book, other than to say it's an adventure relating to one man's search for a box of money resulting from the murder of a rich man who lived nearby. I should caveat this by saying it is neither a murder mystery, nor a mainstream story of any kind. Randomly, bicycles play a big part in the story. <br /> <br />I find the oddity of this book strangely compelling. Often, when I run across a story that is arcane or elusive, I toss it aside, proclaiming that the point of any book is to portray ideas, not confuse the narrative. For whatever reason, I don't think this book, which can certainly be called arcane and elusive, falls into that trap. It strings you along, maintaining your interest in what waits at the end of the story. <br /> <br />There's not much more to say about this book. I don't know what kind of reader will like this nor who will hate it. It's difficult to draw a parallel to any other book I have read. Perhaps a darkly comedic Confederacy of Dunces, but that might be a bit of a stretch. Certainly nothing mainstream which requires a happy ending, where the dragon is slain by the prince and the village lives happily ever after. <br /> <br />Strange, but I really enjoyed it. Recommended.	2004-12-01
US	52559350	REPB0PR20OA9N	0586057242	14000465	The Complete Robot (Robot Series)	Books	3	21	34	N	N	Good Enough, But Past It's Time	With the (at the time) upcoming \\"I, Robot\\" film starring Will Smith about to hit theaters, I decided to re-read this book from my high school years and brush up on all the fun I had the first time I read it. I remember enjoying it a lot back then, and I soon found out that my memories do not resonate with today's version of reading reality. The book was ok, little more. I suppose as I get older I get more critical. Understandable, even if it is a little disappointing. Today, I find the dialog extremely trite, with absurd logic that Asimov abuses to attain the ends of the story, often times not remaining consistent from one story to the next. <br /> <br />The book is a collection of short stories, an expanded version of I, Robot. I also believe this may include every short story ever written by Asimov concerning robots. While entertaining enough, I think most people will be bored with it's length. Of course, you need to take the date of publication into account. Even so, some things don't hold up that well over time. <br /> <br />Some of the stories are good, some are...well, not so good. Asimov was a scientist who wrote, there's no mistaking that. His first love was science, not the intermingling of people in the context of real life. Some of the dialogs border in inanity, while some are just plain sophomoric, a testament to my enjoying this while in high school, I suppose. <br /> <br />In all, it's enjoyable enough. The stories are easy enough to read and mostly entertaining. None is so long that you feel a need to put it down and finish the story later, though some do come close to stretching your patience. For the most part, they are all single-sitting reads. <br /> <br />While not the greatest book ever written, it's worth checking out for a historical perspective, and mostly enjoyable at that.	2004-11-12
US	52559350	R3LBICSI7EG3LC	0802135358	821287206	Fool on the Hill: A Novel	Books	2	6	19	N	N	Off the Mark & Difficult to Endure	No matter how bad a book seems to start off, I try to give it at least 100 pages before I write it off. That sentence alone should tell you all you need to know, as far as my experience goes. I got to page 125, finally calling it quits 25 pages beyond my own minimum, having had enough to satisfy myself that it had little chance of getting better. I'm not sure it's bad, so much as it's...well, I guess I have to say it's bad. It's a bad book. What he tries to do with this book and what he accomplishes are such different entities, I have to believe the end result is not what the author thought he was getting. I cannot, in good faith, recommend this book to anyone. <br /> <br />This is not to say that it's all bad, because it's not. There are some moments in the story when I found myself genuinely interested. Yet those moments are a pebble in this pond of non-intrigue. Toted as a modern day Tom Robbins by some, it is painfully clear that the author is trying to write in the same style as Robbins. It's also painfully obvious that he fails miserably at doing so. <br /> <br />It may turn out that the remainder of this book was excellent. I guess I'll never know since, as I mentioned above, I gave up after 125 pages. But I have my doubts. I wasn't about to torture myself further to find out. I'm not Ferdinand Magellan. I don't have endless hours of time to waste exploring apparent waste lands in the hope that something comes of it. Perhaps waste land is a bit strong, perhaps not. The book is silly, which I'm not adverse to given that I read Adams and Moore and, as mentioned, Robbins. However, this goes beyond silly, which turns out to be just plain dumb. It's a fine line, which the author isn't able to toe. <br /> <br />I'm turned off by this tendency to write off silliness as a foregone conclusion, as the author does here. The segues from one 2-sentence paragraph to the next don't flow, which makes sitting down for more than 3 minutes an effort. This was yet another problem I had with the book. It appears the author doesn't want you to sit down and digest any more than 2 pages at a time. I sat down one day to try and bite off a solid 50 pages, which is the day I tossed the book aside for good. <br /> <br />There are scores of books better than this one, assuredly. Books by Tom Robbins, Douglass Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, or Christopher Moore come to mind. I suggest going out and finding one of them before picking this up.	2004-11-04
US	52559350	R2I8I9CARRBPKF	0060938455	515614189	Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good, Informational, but not Without Bias	A decent book. Many of the ideas are things I believed before picking it up. While given to exaggeration at times, the narrative sticks mostly to the facts, thus allowing the readers to draw their own conclusions. Granted, there's no doubt what conclusion the author wants you to draw. His subjective thoughts tend to become more heavy-handed as the book progresses, which I believe detracts from the book. At the same time, if you've seen the things he has, it's probably hard not to do the same. <br /> <br />Having said that, I do wonder how much this book will appeal to those not already predisposed to thinking this way. While it was a national bestseller, I doubt the meat industry felt the repercussions of it's publication. Furthermore, those on the fence (or in the corner of the meat industry) might feel the intent is to coerced them into thinking the way the author does. I'm not sure since, like I said, I was predisposed to its message to begin with. <br /> <br />With that out of the way, I still contend it's a good book. Even though I was previously aware of the overriding facts, many of the details are new to me. Additionally, specific stories of food horror only help me avoid these culinary pitfalls further. In all, it serves as an eye-opening collection of facts and anecdotes that leave you disgusted with big industry, big government, and humanity in general. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the book bogs down. That, in addition to the less-than-subjective narrative, is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. As an informational collection, it does very well. As a book from cover to cover, it suffers because every chapter sends the same message. Eventually, I found it difficult to pick up because I was tired of the repetitive drum beating. <br /> <br />That shouldn't keep you from reading it, especially if you have questions about the food you eat. A friend said flat-out that I would never eat meat again after I read this book. Another friend went vegetarian afterreading it. Neither happened to me, though I don't eat a lot of meat to begin with. Conversely, this book cemented my already strong anti-fast food opinions. <br /> <br />If you're concerned with the food you eat - and you should be - this book is a must read. Nothing I say here can possibly dent the solid reputation this book already has. Therefore, this review is little more than a recap of a book I recently read. However, if you do read this review in its entirety, I would highly recommend taking a closer look at the food you eat, the role it plays in society & economy, and the government's role in it. Additionally, if you have children, this is a must read. <br /> <br />I agree with some reviewer complaints that the author errantly paints conservatives rather broadly with the blame brush throughout the narrative. I think this is a valid criticism. I do wish informative books like this were written without partisan politics casting it's ugly gloom on the tone of the book, regardless of it's validity. When you add this to the scope of the book, it begs the question of intent. Is the book about food safety, or the well-worn path of partisan politics? The author does himself a disservice in walking down this path. <br /> <br />I certainly recommend this (or some other food information book) before you take another bite.	2004-11-03
US	52559350	R2701J2SJB0DIX	0385481969	793564378	Youth in Revolt: The Journals of Nick Twisp	Books	5	48	53	N	N	Excellent Story No Matter What Your Age	For the sake of being interesting, I will review this book in the style which it was written: <br /> <br />Day 1: Finally started reading this book. Many years ago, a friend suggested I read it. Ever since then, the title was always stuck in my head. When I would see it in print I would think, \\"You know. I really should pick that book up.\\" Eventually I did pick it up, but it ended up in my overly large \\"to read\\" pile. Finally, something made me pick it up today. After 50 pages, it seems interesting. <br /> <br />Day 2: I read more of the book today. I'm having trouble getting into it based on the nature of how it is written. The entire book is written in the form of journal entries. Don't get me wrong, it's easy to read. Still, I find that the short entries lend themselves to reading only a few at a time. Still, over the course of the day I read 100 pages. Certainly an interesting book. <br /> <br />Day 3: I read 250 pages of the book today. I can't put it down. The short journal entries have gone from being a hindrance in reading to an aid in getting rapid snapshots of how the story unfolds. The narrative transpires in small doses which leave you wanting more. As soon as I put the book down I want to pick it up again and get another dose. I cannot remember the last time I was so engrossed in a book. It's uncanny. <br /> <br />Day 4: Today is the final day with the book. That sounds funny, but it's true. I wish it were 1000 pages long and I could get 4 more days out of it. No, make that 2000. For the first time in a long time, I am saddened to see a book coming to a close. I don't want it to end, I enjoy it that much. Normally, I look forward to the close of one story and the beginning of a new one. Not this time. I want this story to go on forever (or a reasonable length of time). It's that enjoyable. <br /> <br />Day 5: I am sitting here the day after, thinking about the book. The ending was good enough, not Earth shattering. Nothing amazing could have happened tomake everything right in the world again. I honestly didn't expect a lot from the ending and I would have been disappointed if he had tried to do make everything perfect. The bulk of the story ties up, which prevents it from merely hanging. Still, some questions remain, like: How did Paul know? <br /> <br />I wish I could pick it up and read it again. But it's too early for that. Being honest, the book wasn't philosophically deep enough for me to learn anything new if I were to reread it immediately. Still, the book was really good. Sitting down with it every day was a pleasure. <br /> <br />If every book were this good, I would read constantly. As it is, I read every day, but not like this. I read this book while brushing my teeth or making coffee. I'll miss this book. It was a great ride which I am sad to see end. <br /> <br />As a final note, I think those who give the book bad ratings are not able to stray from their usual genre of reading and accept this book for what it is. It is a well written and silly narrative about 14-year-old kids that is not really based in reality, but as a 14-year-old might see it. The fact that the story is interpreted through the voice of one of these children is lost on the people who disparage the book. Don't be swayed from reading this, as it harkens back to the silliness inherent in youth which can be appreciated at any age. <br /> <br />Phenomenal entertainment value. Highly recommended.	2004-10-21
US	52559350	R1Q91U8JYBSLW5	0812513754	861837137	Lord of Chaos (The Wheel of Time, Book 6)	Books	3	5	9	N	N	So, So Many Words	Surprise of surprises, the 6th book of the seemingly never ending Wheel of Time series is not nearly as ridiculous as the previous two. While a bit wordy, and  ultimately anti-climatic considering the buildup, this book does a better job keeping the narrative moving, while not making the same mistakes he made in the previous two. <br /> <br />As I said above, this is the 6th book in the Wheel of Time series. If you are reading this review, I can assume you recently finished the fifth book and are seriously considering giving up. Well, six is better than five, for what that's worth. Overall, it does little to move the story in a direction I would call forward; lateral might be a better description. Considering the nearly 1000 pages of text, this is a considerable feat. Still, the lateral movement does enough to keep you interested in the characters. If you are wavering, it might be worth the investment, since you've read 5 books already. <br /> <br />The good? To start, the book is well written. I don't think Jordan lacks the ability to put words together in a very readable way. When you pick it up, the words flow. Granted, he goes a little overboard at times and proceeds to describe absolutely nothing in 5-10 pages. Still, words are a strength of his in this book. Additionally, there are fewer instances of blatant nudity in this one, though his gratuitous references still exist. Nevertheless, the story is compelling enough to keep you reading. <br /> <br />The bad? Well, my biggest complaint would be that nothing is remotely close to wrapping up. The intricate weave of tales only grows, and nothing ever comes to a resolution. With the sheer number of story lines, it would help the reader keep his sanity if some of them were spun out. Also, the near-neurotic immaturity of some of the women in this book is beyond absurd. It's his biggest downfall as a fantasy writer, IMO. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a decent fantasy narrative. The story moves quickly enough with a fewbumps here and there. As I mentioned, many of the problems present in the preceding books do not manifest themselves in this one. Plus the story does move, albeit sideways a fair amount of the time. <br /> <br />The book is decent, probably worth reading if you're on the fence after the fifth one.	2004-10-14
US	52559350	R1Q61C52Q1PVUA	0671657151	12401298	The Closing of the American Mind	Books	2	17	50	N	N	I Closed My Mind to this Book	Two months and 190 pages after starting this book, I simply couldn't take it anymore. I picked up the book this morning in an attempt to get to the 200 page mark, and a few minutes later realized I was staring at the page with one of those SAT-reading section stares. I had no idea what I had just read. I put the book down, deciding then I had read enough. <br /> <br />It honestly baffles me that this is a best seller. I have no idea how this can be. First of all, the book is written in such a dry, verbose manner that you proceed straight to bed the moment you pick it up. What's more, the author never intends to make the book palatable for the reader, focusing instead on run-on sentences and obfuscation as opposed to tried and true idea conveyance methods, such as getting to the point. <br /> <br />When he finally does say something you might consider a point, it's not a bad one at all. At the same time, it's hard to read this book and not wonder what the motivation is. The book meanders; having no coherent line of thought so far as I can see. It appears Bloom is more concerned with making sure you know he's read Rousseau than saying anything of value. It also appears he's gone through life thinking too much about everything. As a result, his words come across in a manner which suggests that people who haven't thought the same way must be morons, and the mire he finds himself in is better than being clear minded and unburdened by this overwhelming depression towards the human species. <br /> <br />At least...that's what I get out of it. I imagine it's a tremendously subjective assessment and those who disagree with me will likely say that I'm of the subset of the American mind he is writing about. In one sentence Bloom lauds this attitude of man, the next he bashes it. Consistency isn't of paramount importance as he meanders through this diatribe of confusion. What you read in the previous paragraph may or may not have anything to do with this one. It appears to me this book was written over the course of a very long and non-continuous time. <br /> <br />Again, I quit after 190 pages. I'm not sure why I gave it that many, because this turned out to be a waste of time for me. There are pertinent thoughts in this book, to be sure. But the way he says them and the fact that he says 100 inane things for every point made is what makes this book weak. Coming to the decision that I wasn't going to read any more of it was a happy one. I'm glad to be done with it. <br /> <br />Move on, nothing much to see here.	2004-08-12
US	52559350	RTBPWIML6GMPP	0440944597	638391927	The Chocolate War	Books	2	7	12	N	N	Overrated and Unnecessary Book	Point blank, I don't like this book. I see little value in it, and much like the other Cormier book I read (I am the Cheese) it is intended for a teen audience, attempting to show it's audience that life is a miserable existence, where their place on this earth is dubious at best and any act of individuality will be crushed in the gears of the uncaring populace. I cannot subscribe to this message, because it's an absurd inaccuracy.<br />This will certainly put an end to my reading of Cormier. After my experience with the first book, I wonder why I would have bought this. I have no good answer to that question other than to say that I wanted to see what all the praise was about. It brings to mind the adage that if you burn me once, shame on you; if you burn me twice, shame on me. Well, shame on me for reading this book. I get what I deserve. Do yourself a favor and don't repeat my mistake.<br />I imagine the story is meant to show its readers they are not alone. That, and to sell books. That's fine, either way you look at it. However, in the end the bad guys essentially, for lack of a better word, win. There are no good guys, nor are there bad guys. So the assessment is subjective, in a sense. We're dealing with kids, and these kids represent a thoroughly absurd un-reality in the story. Through it all I found myself interested in the story, I'll admit this much. But in the end, I still come back to the question of, \\"What's the point?\\" It's so thoroughly pointless I found myself entirely disgusted with the book, as well as the author.<br />Just as I didn't see the point of 'I am the Cheese', I don't see one here. I can't recommend this book by any stretch of the imagination. Books that would be better for the intended audience include Catch-22 (Heller), Brave New World (Huxley), or Catcher in the Rye (Salinger).	2004-04-08

The book is touted as a &quot;must read&quot; for dog lovers. I'm not a dog lover, nor am I a dog owner. Yet I believe you could claim this is a must read for anyone. The book is so much more than a dog lover's book. It's a great story regardless.<br />The guy writing the book tells the story of his adventure training for, and running, the Iditarod. As you likely know, this is an extremely long dog sled race across a part of Alaska. From the moment he decides to do this, a litany of bad decisions and on-the-fly learning experiences make the author realize that nothing is ever as easy as he thinks. This is especially true when you line up so many sled-pulling dogs and try to contain them in any way, shape, or form. The story plunges through miles of snow packed narrative that makes you laugh with almost every paragraph. In addition to his hilarious trials and tribulations, the author comes to love the outdoors and be at one with his dogs. His relationship with the dogs grows to a point where considers himself one of them. He comes to understand this is part of what the Iditarod is; becoming part dog. Together they endure the brutal weather, the long days, and slowly become a team.<br />The narrative is engrossing, pulling you in and letting you out only when the words run dry. The book is short; you could read the entire thing in a long afternoon. But it's too good to read that quickly. Consuming it in one sitting would be a waste of enjoyment. It's much better to give yourself small doses of laughter instead of ingesting it all at once.<br />It's a great book. I'm not sure there's much more to say about it than that. Well worth the read. I highly recommend it.	2004-03-24

Like any trilogy, after you read the first 2, you feel obligated to complete the series and read the final one. No matter what I say in this review, nothing will deter you from reading the third of the trio. This review is written for posterity's sake, and in keeping with my practice of reviewing books after I read them.<br />The book is mediocre-good, much like the first one. It's better than the second book and probably not quite as good as the first one. Towards the end of book 5 (the 3rd of the series actually contains Book 5 and Book 6) it seems to me that Tolkein is so far off the deep end that he loses all ability to communicate words in a digestible manner. The writing borders on horrendous, and the reader cannot differentiate one speaker from the next. Everyone speaks in the same voice, with the same grand tones, saying the same trite things.<br />Book 6 is better. It wraps up the series and allows the reader to put the book down satisfied with the series. Without book 6, I don't think that would have been possible. One problem is this. There's no suspense for too many pages. Relatively early in the narrative we see the &quot;return of the king&quot; and the tidy conclusion subsequent to that. After this, there's no suspense, no reason to keep reading. If it weren't for the hijinx in the Shire at the end, this book would have been pretty bland, all in all.<br />I have thought before, and this book again shows me, that Tolkein had a great imagination but was a weak writer. Pages upon pages are devoted to the most mundane of things, while action scenes are over in mere paragraphs. It seems the author wanted to gloss over most of the action, preferring to work with the majesty and pageantry he had created in his mind. If Tolkein could have forgone the written word and found a way to allow people a brief glimpse into his head, Peter Jackson's films would seem mundane in comparison.<br />But the reality is we're dealing with the printed word, and this is not the strongest medium for Tolkein to have chosen. In his time, it was all he had. Now Jackson has taken that and worked wonders with it. I think the movies are a better reflection of what Tolkein would have liked to portray. The books, other than the Hobbit, could have been done better.<br />Still, as I said, you will read it. It's a good enough ending to a classic series. Assuredly, the time it takes to read this book is worth it, even if it does drag a bit. It's a fantasy classic, and you should immerse yourself in it for the sake of the experience.ing with the printed word, and this is not the strongest medium for Tolkein to have chosen.

It's been over a month since I finished it, but it still exists in my mind as a very good story told through very good writing. Amy Tan does a wonderful job spinning a tale, several of them actually, in this work of art that is widely considered (with good reason) to be a modern classic.<br />For someone like myself, married to a Taiwanese woman, this book lends insight into a world I am familiar with, yet remain a good distance from truly understanding. I find it a fascinating topic of discussion for my perspective as it pertains to my wife, her family, and my Chinese friends. This book, as simple and short as it is, packs a significant cultural punch through the nuances of the words it is written in.<br />Yet you hardly need to be in my position to read this book. It stands on its own as a great piece of work. You won't like it if you have an inclination against things Asian, such as those enamored with emotions as seen in The Rising Sun. I won't try to convince those readers. Otherwise, this book offers something for any reader.<br />This is a touching narrative about 4 American women of Chinese descent and their mothers who were born in China. The story is actually 8 stories, very loosely brought together by a centerpiece that allows you to slide from one narrative to the next, never having to draw much of a connection between them. The book sheds light on the separation between each mother and her daughter, while showing how all 4 mothers and all 4 daughters live similar lives.<br />Tan does a splendid job writing a splendid book. Anyone interested in modern literature would do themselves justice to read this. I readily admit I have more riding on this book than many who might read it. Yet I believe the book stands on its own as worth the read, no matter what your background.<br />Very highly recommended.	2004-03-17

I have to say this one made me laugh more than any book has in a long time. I think the last thing I read that made me laugh this much was Bill Bryson's &quot;Walk in the Woods&quot;. From cover to cover, it's completely enjoyable. That's about that. While the subject matter isn't going to shed light on difficult situations in your life, it's surely going to make you forget them for a while. So sit back, grab the book, and delve in for what will almost certainly be an entertaining ride.<br />Moore was recommended to me by a friend a long, long time ago. She recommended this based on our mutual like of Tom Robbins. While not as deep and philosophical as Robbins, I find him every bit as entertaining. Funny, and often times out of left field, his writings easily allow you to forget the world around you and immerse yourself in some good, off-the-wall humor. This book is simply funny. No diatribes about the president, or the pope, or politics of any sort. Just left-field humor.<br />The story is out of nowhere. The Lust Lizard is obviously a major part of the story; by looking at the cover of the book you know you're not getting a believable narrative by any stretch of the imagination. An enormous green lizard with a human foot sticking out of its mouth graces the cover. I think that's a good first step towards reading this book. If you enjoy laughing and the thought of a giant green lizard with a foot sticking out of its mouth doesn't turn you off, then this could very well be to your liking.<br />I blew through it in no time. It was so good I went out and got 2 more from this author and look forward to them both. In general, I try to read deeper stuff than this. But as a nice break, this is as good as it gets when you need to get away from heavy reading. I'm glad this book managed to make its way to the top of my reading pile. It was clearly worth the read.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-20

I'm also not going to say it was good or it was bad or it was anything other than what I just said, for the most part, which is that this is not my kind of book. Overall, it made me laugh a few times. And you have to be somewhat heartened that the guy was able to find his soul mate, or what he thought to be his soul mate at the time.<br />In real life, I found out that Bach and his soul mate got divorced. I felt that it was inevitable, because the author doesn't espouse one of my beliefs in life, which is that you need to be happy with yourself before you can be happy with someone else. Admittedly, it begs the question of that even being possible. I'm not going to offer an answer either way, but this author didn't even try.<br />A good friend of mine lent me this book, which is the reason I read it. Not for nothing, I think it's good to read outside your usual \\"pattern\\" of reading because it opens your eyes to other authors and styles out there. For that reason, I'm glad to have read it. But beyond that, this was a bit of a failed excursion into a new realm of writing and authors that I had hoped would pay off.<br />The book was easy enough to read, though towards the end it got very dry and difficult to get through. I don't think I would read a book by this author again, even though a lot of people swear by him. In the end, I guess it's best to say, to each his own. This one really didn't do much for me because it never really shed any light on anything new. And I'm not a fan of his personal life, so it didn't appeal to me in that regard. As for the actual story, well if it sounds too good to be true...	2004-01-17

It could more accurately be named the Encyclopedia of the World's Most Dangerous Places. It's that good. It's that complete. It's a bible in its genre.<br />I'm not sure what else to say other than that opening paragraph. You can open it up randomly, start reading, and immediately be engrossed in it. More likely, you'll scan the table of contents and pick out a country that's of particular interest at the moment. For instance, when I got this book, it was Afghanistan. Now, it might be the same, or Iraq, Iran, Israel, North Korea...there are any number of places that might interest you at the moment. And this book goes on to cover it with excruciating detail.<br />If I were forced to make one, the only complaint would have to be that there's too much information. But that's hardly a complaint. I'm merely trying to be objective and it's hard to come up with much of anything lacking in this book. If I had it my way, I would include an end-of-chapter essay about every country, as opposed to the select few that appear in this book. I really enjoyed these slices of dangerous life discussed there. Written by various authors, they lend credence to a lot of the information preceding it.<br />Good stuff. This is a great reference to have on your bookshelf, so the next time a random country pops up on the International War Zone radar, you can pick it up and know a lot in less than an hour. Above these specific country details, this book also delves into specifics about what makes any country dangerous. From landmines to kidnapping, this book really does a great job covering much of what you need to know about the dangers in this world.<br />An excellent reference to have for those interested in keeping abreast of the dangerous reality of our world.	2004-01-05
US	52559350	R3PMUHJ09GIGT9	0395500761	84629820	Richard Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America, The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster, and In Watermelon Sugar	Books	2	14	35	N	N	Trout Whatevering in Wherever	This book really doesn't do much for me. Maybe 10 years ago it might have. This sort of &quot;I'm just going to write whatever I see in front of me and then make a silly non-sequiter out of the next sentence and call it symbolism&quot; is a somewhat lost effort on me. Maybe not lost, but not that effective. I think it masks the reality that the book just isn't very good.<br />I guess there was a time and place for this. The book is from 1967 or thereabouts. Maybe if I was in college in 1967, and I read this book, I would have been thrilled. But it isn't 1967, and I'm not in college. So I trudged through this book and proclaimed, &quot;Whatever.&quot; <br />I agree with one reviewer who says, &quot;...you have to keep in mind that at that time, if it didn't make much sense if was always considered good.&quot; I generally agree with this. I think it's still true to an extent now. You see this in books and music. If you throw together a completely unfathomable set of thoughts, sounds, or colors, someone is going to say that it's a masterpiece. People will then feel threatened that they don't get it. Dominoes fall and people feel obligated to agree that it's a masterpiece, because they're an idiot otherwise.<br />Whatever, maybe I'm an idiot. But the book's symbolism and abstract ideas are usually either silly or shallow. There are moments when I was entertained. So the book isn't exactly useless in that regard. But as an overall unit, it's lacking in anything other than brevity. Thus, if the obscure metaphor is lost on you, you can try to snare the next one in 2 or 3 pages. So you got that going for you. Which is nice.<br />Unless you're sure you'll like this book, I would pass on it. Otherwise, you'll meander from start to finish and wonder why you read it in the first place, much like I did. I don't see any thrilling reason to read this, so it's hard for me to recommend it to anyone.<br />In the end, whatever. Not my cup of tea.	2004-01-03

I'm not sure what that says about the book overall but take it for what it's worth. I debated for a bit about whether I liked it or not. It was a good enough read, which is not exactly a thrilling testimonial. But it didn't make my pulse quicken with excitement.<br />I thought the first third of the book was very good and it had me eager to read the remainder of the book. But after that, it was slow, methodical, and generally boring. I wasn't waking up every day looking forward to reading it. To me, that's the ultimate non-vote of confidence for a book. A book needs to be calling your name for it to be read. This one was not.<br />In the science fiction genre, I think Assimov has a lot more interesting material out there. Even though this is considered a classic, I don't see it as worthy of such a lofty distinction. I think his aims at religion and philosophy were too grand for what he was capable of. <br />I agree with some people who said the buildup to many scenes was anti-climatic. Many words were poured out for events that would go nowhere. And the events that did generate action were often times written as if the main character was taking out the laundry. There was no fire to many of the characters and scenes.<br />I note 2 things about the Amazon listing of this book. The first is that it's been reviewed 814 times. The second is that it has an average rating of 4.5 stars. At the end of the day, my review isn't going to change many people's minds out there. But I feel obligated to write it anyway.<br />Having said that, proceed as you will. This review isn't going to change many opinions and most will think I'm probably out to lunch with this review. Fair enough, I suppose. Maybe I just didn't see the brilliance on the pages. Or maybe my expectations are higher. <br />If you must, you must. But I think there are much better books on the market that you can pass your time reading.	2003-11-29

This is an excellent book. It is the most modern novel to make any of the Top 100 lists of all-time great books. This one deserves everything people say about it and more. This is possibly one of the best books ever written.<br />I can't say this book is for everyone. That's not really saying much because I don't think a book exists that is suited for everyone, save for maybe a dictionary. Still, this is an intense, methodical book. Those looking for a quick read are best suited to seek something else, because this one is not a quick read by any stretch of the imagination.<br />Within that intensity and thickness one finds the brilliant yet insane world of Saleem Sinai, the main character of this story. Both allegorical and literal, this story winds though such a myriad of well-woven sub-stories that one needs to put the book down every few pages to think about what was just read.<br />From his birth to the book's finality, we rise up the ups and fall down the downs with Saleem. We are twisted, confused, wrought out, and yet manage to survive through thick and more thick. From front to back, side to side, this narrative thoroughly tosses you about. From chapter to chapter one never knows where you're going to end up.<br />With excellent writing plus both laughable and dramatic scenes, Rushdie shows why he is one of the greatest writers of our time. Truly an instant classic, this book is a must read for those who want to explore some of this generation's greatest. This work is wonderful, beautiful, exasperating, and terrifying. All of these things Rushdie manages to squeeze into one pickle jar of a character in Saleem Sanai.<br />Excellent.	2003-08-10

Overall, it's a fair book in terms of what others produce in today's market. But for Robbins, it's clearly well below his standards.<br />A problem I have with this book is that I never care about the characters, nor do I care about the plot. While reading this I would wake up every morning, and maybe I would read it. Or maybe I wouldn't. The idea that there were still more pages to go did not intrigue me. Contrary to my past Robbins experiences where I had trouble putting the book down, this time I had trouble picking it up. <br />If I'm being totally honest, I have this exasperated question to pose to Robbins: An Epilogue where we find out what happened to all the characters? I feel insulted. Seriously, this isn't a Brady Bunch book. I'm not yearning to find out who went where, how, and why. I don't read Robbins for that. I read Robbins for eye opening perspectives. I read Robbins for new stories, for new situations, for fresh looks at old topics. <br />Robbins accomplishes none of these. His usual word play? Mundane. His dancing metaphors? Flat footed. Long winded descriptions that make your mind's eye glow with excitement? Short of breath. To boot, his messages, once cloaked in brilliant prose, are now thrown at you with the grace of a monkey throwing a piece of crap from its cage.<br />Is this a joke of a book? Am I the punch line? I find it hard to believe this is all he has left in the tank. After so much excellence, it's hard to believe that this is where we've ended up. Robbins should have worked on this one another 2 years before it saw the light of day.<br />Obviously, I'm disappointed. Yes, there is some standard Robbins content. But only a sliver of it. It's not a terrible book on its own. But it's not great either. It is what it is. You is what you it. Man oh man, I'm not sure if this was a mistake or not, though. Even if one claimsthere are no mistakes, this one will make you wonder. <br />If you are a long time Robbins reader, you have to pick this one up for the sake of completeness. If you're new to Robbins, try Woodpecker before you read this.	2003-07-25

Undoubtedly, it has some good advice and I would be lying if I said otherwise. At the same time, Bailey is off the deep end, which is fine if you too are off the deep end. But if you're only starting to get into a pattern of weight loss and healthy eating, this book is probably going to turn you away from that.<br />The fact of the matter is that Bailey has some good advice shrouded in inanity. If you eat cheese and crackers, chips, cookies, and honey roasted peanuts every night, you're not going to stop that completely and eat non-fat yogurt, non-fat cottage cheese, and ice cream once a year. It's just not going to happen. To think as much is pure folly.<br />The problem with this book, and every other diet book out there, is that they all say to do it now. Now now now. This makes little sense, since we have to consider the fact that any change is something we want to maintain for the rest of our lives. So, while yogurt and cottage cheese might be the ultimate goal, I think it's more effective to start with one small change at a time.<br />If you're not starting from scratch, but are trying to get a feel for how to hone your current healthy eating habits, this book is for you. This is precisely where I found myself and I think it did open my eyes to a few things. For instance, I think the anti-fat bandwagon is way, way overblown. But in this book, Bailey does make a good point that many of the foods that are high in fat are also very low in nutrition density. This is by far the best argument yet for avoiding things like cheese and honey.<br />Still, I think eating 1 bowl of ice cream a year is well into fanaticism. As is his obsession with fat. Cutting down is good. Avoiding it like it's evil is another thing entirely. In fact, it bothers me that Bailey seems to suggest that chemical substitutes are an acceptable way to avoid fat. That's a bothersome notion.<br />And really, why on earth would you be against pancakes? I eat buckwheat pancakes with fresh fruit and no syrup. Please explain to me why this is bad. Our psychotic fixation with directing unnecessary derision against one food is clinical sometimes. This book provides some serious examples of that.<br />Another thing I do not like is that portion control is not a goal in this book. He essentially admits that it's fine to eat like a slathering hog, just so long as you eat healthy food. I could not agree with that less. One of the problems we have in this society is that we cannot and will not control the amount of food we eat. If we ate reasonable amounts, there would be less of a need to consume 3 pounds of lettuce every night.<br />Having said that, I will reiterate that the content of the book is solid, in terms of what should and should not be eaten. Hey, let's face it, 24 ounces of steak every few days is going to kill us. Period. Eating foods high in calories and low in nutrition will fatten us, and leave us unhealthy, yearning for the nutrition our bodies require.<br />The concept of nutrition density is one that people should take from the book. We need nutrition, not calories. If we get ample nutrition then we're all set. If, however, we pile on the calories and lack the nutrition, our bodies cry for more food. And we give it more food, usually bad stuff.<br />So take the idea of nutrition density from this book. But leave the artificial substitutes there. And leave the notion that you can stuff yourself at every meal. Those are bad ideas, period. Eat a nutritious diet, learn portion control, and keep it natural and you'll do fine, even if you do eat ice cream (small portions) every night. <br />Worth the read, but beware of neurotic & poorly thought out advice.	2003-06-22

The book encompasses her life growing into a young woman, as well as the life of her mother. The book could be considered a sort of biography of Jung Chang's mother as told through the eyes of her daughter.<br />The setting is mainly post-WWII China. The KMT under Chiang Kai-shek are battling the communists under Mao Tse-tung. As history tells us, Mao was victorious and CKS fled to Taiwan to brutalize the people there. Mao won China and a much larger populace to brutalize. Either way, the civil war ended the way it did. And either way, brutality was assuredly going to ensue.<br />This is the time frame of the book. Chang grows up in this, where her parents are both party officials in the Communist movement. Initially, there is a sense of privilege in the family. But this is not overtly the case, as her father's dedication to the ideals of the party overwhelm any attempts by the family to use that status as influence.<br />The first 100 pages are good. They're enjoyable to read and it shows that the author can string words together in a competent manner. Chang is not a wordsmith, meaning that you aren't riveted by the craft of her words. But she is a very competent story teller. And this story deserves to be told. The harsh reality is that the history of post-war China is nearly as brutal as the atrocities the Nazis thrust upon the Jewish population in WWII. While not that horrendous, Mao's China became a festering pot of hatred and violence.<br />But I digress. My point about the first 100 pages is to comment on the next 100 pages. They stunk. In fact, it was really hard for me to get through pages 100-200. The author goes on a bit of a melodramatic tear, where she seems to be writing through the pain of her mother, as opposed to taking a remotely objective view of her life at the time. Admittedly, this is a tragic story to relay,especially when your mother has endured such pain. Yet, for the reader, things were clearly exaggerated and complaints emanated from the book at such a pace that I nearly quit on the book.<br />But I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't, because the story is worth it. I give this book 4 stars because of the other 400 pages. Despite those 100 pages where I could barely get through 10 minutes without wanting to stop, this book is outstanding. A highly recommended read in which your eyes will be open to a span of history that I, as an American, knew very little about. Considering the magnitude of this, it makes me ashamed that these histories are not taught in American schools.<br />I imagine there are a million stories like this to tell. This is merely one of them. Considering Chang's status as a child of a party official, we see first hand how one family can go from the top of the ladder to the bottom of it. And in this transition, we see what Mao turned China into. <br />In reading some critiques of this book, the subtitle probably is misleading. This is not so much a story of 3 daughters of China as it is a tale of terror that Mao's Communism brought to their family. Some of that terror was borne from the culture. But most was a result of Mao's policies. Chang asks in one section, \\"What turned these people into such monsters?\\" This is a good question, and very pertinent in getting to the point of the book. But that point is not resonant with the subtitle, namely 3 daughters of China.<br />I don't think the book was meant as a history of the time, or a specific history of 3 daughters. But it was meant to say, \\"Look at the hell that existed here. How can the world not know this?\\" Chang does this, and she does it chillingly well.<br />I imagine there are other books that encompass the story of China more successfully. And there are probably more moving narratives. But the emotion coupled with the history are an interesting read. I think the book is very well done and I thinkthe detractors of this book were expecting something specific when they picked it up, thus the disappointment. <br />But setting aside expectations, this book is a very good read. I expected nothing, as my mother-in-law lent it to me as a way to teach me about China under Mao. So I opened it with no preconceived notions. Again, I'm glad I did so. It was worth reading, no matter what I expected.<br />If you've got any interest in Mao's China & how it relates to the plight of someone who lived through that time period, I very much recommend this book.	2003-05-14

If you wish, you can take that as a commentary on the book, or a commentary on the reviewer. Either way, I suppose it's an indication of something.<br />I read this book, or half of it, because a friend lent it to me out of the blue. Willing as I am to try new things, especially those that gravitate from apparent randomness, I picked it up and gave it the old college try...which is exactly where I felt I was after a few pages.<br />This book brought me back to Expository Writing class from my freshman year in college. This is a collection of short stories that slowly meander, not necessarily with a point, but rich in word energy. I use the expression 'word energy' here because the value in this book is the language, not the tale itself. At least for me this was the case. Your mileage, as they say, may vary.<br />I can't shake the feeling that this collection exists merely for the author to proclaim, \\"Boy, I miss Wyoming, but it sure does suck.\\" Or something similar, with more descriptive words. Since my freshman year of college was 13 years ago, I'm not being forced to analyze every paragraph to an absurd degree. As such, the stories of this book sort of meander through the plains of Wyoming, gliding from one page to the next, but never going anywhere.<br />I imagine this is perfectly fine for some people, but I feel I'm being led on a walk through a corn field. While some people like to walk in corn fields, it's not my thing. And that's what this book is...or isn't. It isn't my thing. I don't relate to any of these stories; none of them speak to me. I don't think it's bad, per se. But my relation to these anecdotes is almost entirely non-existent.<br />So there you go. To me, it's an average book. And I think it's enjoyably written in some places. But I don't see many of these stories with a direction. They roll, they plod, they wisp. But in the end, they don't go anywhere. Granted, each reader will have their own opinion of how this compilation touches them. And that's the great thing about books. But for me, it wasn't a very enlightening walk.	2003-05-13

Instead, it's called Fury, and it's a well titled book. It's well titled because it encompasses the fury of our intense lifestyle which creates disposable humanity as a byproduct. People come, they go. They live, they die. All of this is no big deal to the characters here. They move on. Life is dispensable. Humanity is disposable.<br />Fury is what I would call a modern day mythology about this disposable humanity, which the book cover so accurately describes as life's Tragicomedy. The Tragicomedy of our Disposable Humanity. It has a sort of New York ring to it. Truly a brilliant and probably sad concept in this day and age.<br />I get the impression from some of the reviews here that people don't see this as a mythological piece. Conversely, this is precisely what I get out of it, especially the tempting and alluring Neela. The symbolism of her beauty in this forlorn & furious world we live in is rare. She epitomizes the myth in our Fury, deep in our imaginations.<br />Rushdie is a very aware writer who combines elements of the intellectual with pop culture in a unique and believable way. I have not read other Rushdie works (other than Haroun), so I cannot say for certain. But this appears to be a new approach in his writing. While it is an interesting read, I'm not certain it comes out the way he intended it; but only slightly.<br />The trio of women meeting in the bedroom is forced and lacking grace. Still, I take this as part of the myth. I allow Rushdie the license to create the point and attempt to feel the tangible fury which resonates between the three. Even granting that, there is something wrong in the scene. Perhaps it was enough time to let the scene develop in Rushdie's mind. Then again, time is something we lack in this furious world. A victim of his own creation's reality?<br />I do not appreciate the ending as much as some people. In fact, I found it troubling. Our main character is nothing in and of himself. Rushdie almost throws this book in the face of the adage that you can't be happy with others unless you are happy with yourself. Rushdie is suggesting, to me, that you shouldn't try to be happy with yourself first, but you should try to fill the void with something else. Yet he also suggests that the void creates this fury.<br />Despite this, I do like the book. I think it lacks a poignant ending. But that doesn't make it a bad book as some claim. I think it's an excellent work which has a few snags. Since I am not well versed in Rushdie, I'm not going to make a comment about whether you should read it or not. I would follow others who suggest reading another of his works before this one. I did not do that, yet do not feel I lost anything because of it. In fact, without previous works to contrast with this, I think this is great. <br />Even if it does have a few glitches, I recommend it.	2003-04-18

This book comes in a time of Vonnegut's writing career where he was both a great teacher and a great artist. This is a culmination of those teachings, put together in a uniquely artistic manner.<br />The story is an anti-war exploration of the meaning of life. Rather, as the back covers proclaims, it is an odyssey through time. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, hops back and forth among his memories (in time) in an effort to put together the fractured reality which exists there. Along the way, Vonnegut creates resonances which make for superb reading. I don't think I overstate the case when I call it brilliant.<br />Pilgrim, in this odyssey, finds that time does not proceed linearly, as we perceive it. Time merely is. If an event exists, it always exists since there is no past, present, nor future. Pilgrim learns this when he is abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Another tidbit he learns is that war is unavoidable. However, war doesn't exist in every moment in time, so the Tralfamadorians choose to visit those moments when there is no war.<br />On one hand, this is an absurd statement for an anti-war book. If Pilgrim finds that war is inevitable, how are we to believe we can avoid situations like Dresden? I don't think this is Vonnegut's message, exactly. Tralfamadorians choose to spend their conscious time in moments when war isn't. Since we live linearly, we should likewise choose to exist in moments when there is no war. If we could, most of us would choose to spend our time in moments of peace. So perhaps war is inevitable, but we don't need to live through it right now.<br />It's hard for me to imagine anyone who wouldn't like this book. I suppose if you were too young to understand, it may be unthrilling. Aside from that, you can assume that war hawks will dismiss it as gibberish, since Vonnegut does not portray war as glorious. As strange as it sounds, Vonnegut would probably call it gibberish too. <br />An excellent book, even if it is gibberish.	2003-02-18
US	52559350	R20SENFS1A9AVI	0553380648	377895949	The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Indeed, an American Classic	My first expression is, \\"Wow. What an awesome book.\\" Well, maybe this isn't an awesome book, but I found it to be awesome for me. I can't justify giving this 5 stars because it's not a 5 star book. Let me explain. Suppose there's a song on the radio, and you know it's not really the best song in the world. But you love it just the same. That's what I feel about this book. It's not the best book ever written. But it really works for me. <br />I am saddened to see this book come to a close. This is because the Prankster story essentially dies at the end. Sure, they will always be Pranksters, and throughout this book, I felt like I was a Prankster too. The story is one of American history; one that defines something unique and heavily influential in its time. The book does a great job making me feel like I was there. I am there. I am a Prankster.<br />I feel sad now because the Prankster movie is over. Cassady is dead. Kesey is dead. The Prankster movie is no more. With this book, Wolfe is able to draw me into the movie and drop me out again. Only minutes ago I read the final pages. Now I feel something I experienced is gone. A great wash of memories has rushed through my head in too short a time span. <br />Wolfe does all of this in 400 pages. Granted, there are times when Wolfe is on another page than I am. These are moments when the words flow from him, but not *to* me. In these moments, I cannot say this is a 5 star book. If you read it, you'll be satisfied in allowing me to say that this is his movie. You might not know what I mean when I say it was his movie. But you can figure it out.<br />This book is Tom Wolfe's movie. It is also his movie merged with the Prankster movie and how they saw it happen. I am greatly intrigued by the story of Neal Cassady. Cassady plays a central role in this, yet is always content to flip his sledge hammer, or drive whatever car he had, or do something that wasn't necessarily on the same page as anyone else. Cassady is a very interesting presence in 2 major cultural movements, namely the Beat Generation and the Probation Generation, as Wolfe so poignantly relays it.<br />We're brought through the beginning, middle, and end of Ken Kesey's heavy run with LSD and the Merry Pranksters. We are in Perry Lane. La Honda. On the bus. In Mexico. And of course, furthur with each chapter. We experience all of these situations. We feel the reality in these words. We live it.<br />On the cover of this book is the terse comment, \\"American Classic.\\" This quote is attributed to Newsweek. One only imagines when this comment was written. Really, who cares? The point is, I think it's accurate. For the majority of this book, I wasn't sure this was a fitting description. American Classic? Well, maybe that was a bit dramatic, I thought. After having gone through it, I have to agree. An American classic.<br />I'm still wrapped up in the euphoria of having just finished the book. So let me come back to Earth. Who is this book for? I think those people interested in the history of the 60's LSD culture previous to the Summer of Love will enjoy this. Kesey helps blaze the LSD trail in the San Francisco area in the early to mid 60's. This is a great account of that blazing story.<br />I have also recently read Storming Heaven, by Jay Stevens. That too is a great book which turned me on to this. While Stevens does not get very subjective with his words, he does a great job covering a myriad of topics. If you want to delve into one of the many topics he touches on, this is a great start. If you're looking for an unbiased history of the time period, this isn't the book for you.<br />So why not 5 stars? I have to be honest in rating the book on it's own merit, as opposed to how it made me feel. Yes, I loved it. But I realize that it's not perfect. The poetic ramblings are harsh. Those interludes are hard to follow most of the time. Wolfe admits that he tries to put the reader in a state which will convey the mood or atmosphere of the text. At times he does a good job. Other times, I think he misses the mark and you are left wondering.<br />Other than that, I heartily recommend this book. It's a fascinating read which pulls you into its movie. Well done indeed.	2003-02-08
US	52559350	R2FRWFZLV0580B	0812550307	638271918	The Fires of Heaven (The Wheel of Time, Book 5)	Books	3	80	89	N	N	Average, Slightly Better Than Last One	I'm going to start this review with an assumption; that you've read the first 4 books in the Wheel of Time series. I'm going to make a second assumption; that you're not sure if you want to embark on a 1000 page long journey to...wherever the next one goes.<br />That's a start. If those assumptions are right, then this review may help you. If not, maybe this review will serve to give you an idea of how Jordan writes. Failing those 2, I have no idea why you might be reading this. But I'll do my best to entertain you.<br />Jordan can put words together. Like a bricklayer, he can slap words down and cement them in place with the best of them. As you read the book, you never stumble through pages of narrative. If the procession of words is a foundation, Jordan builds a good one. It's fairly easy to walk through the pages of the book because Jordan is, in general, a good wordsmith. What's he not necessarily good at is getting to the point. His well built foundation often times supports a minimal structure.<br />This book is better than the 4th in the series. But after several hundred pages, you begin to seriously wonder why you're still reading it. After roughly 600 pages, I asked myself, \\"Is this going anywhere?\\" I was reminded of the Talking Heads song, Road to Nowhere. I'm actually being serious. <br />Eventually it does go somewhere, and that's what makes this book better than the 4th in the series. That, and the fact that the last 100 pages serve as the conclusion. In contrast, I think book #4 was wrapped up in about 5 pages. However, I'd be lying if I said I had trouble putting it down. The truth is, Jordan slogs through another loooooooong book to tell a relatively normal length story; but with a lot of words added to describe things you don't necessarily want to read.<br />Jordan must work under some restriction where he is required to maintain a conservation of feminine anger in any book he writes. One of the problems I have with the average Jordan character isthat they more often than not act like a pre-teen with a sour disposition. Resonant with this is Jordan's lack of character development. This book does a better job in that regard. However, some characters regress. Some that acted with composure in the previous books suddenly get, as strange as it sounds, immature.<br />Another annoyance I have with Jordan is his vocabulary. In one sentence, he actually uses the expression, \\"Languid hauteur.\\" Are you serious? I feel as though I am the object of Jordan's attempt to learn a new word every week. I'm not here to build my vocabulary. I just want to read a fantasy story. Others have commented on this same phenomenon, so I'm not the only one who thinks that reading \\"haughty\\" 20 times in a 300 page stretch of narrative is odd.<br />Another of Jordan's shortcomings is his ludicrous depiction of women. I'm not sure how many feminine rituals there are in the series now, but rest assured of this. No ritual exists in this book without female nudity. Whatever Jordan aims for with this, he misses so widely that I think he shot the wrong way. I won't even offer suggestions as to what exactly is going on there.<br />I think we're supposed to be led to believe these books are built with a strong female presence. The reality of the matter is that most women in the book act like teenage girls who still think that boys might actually have cooties. The reverse is true also, with most male characters randomly veering off on his own train of thought in which he deduces every woman is 51 cards short of a deck. Maybe that's a fair assessment, considering the way Jordan portrays most of them.<br />Even with all of this, the story is better than the last. The angry female characters are becoming less of an issue with Jordan, while building strength is becoming his predominant theme. The idea of the characters \\"building strength\\" is one I took from another reviewer, who suggests these stories are like a game of D&D being played out in a book. Ithink there's a lot of truth to that opinion. Every chapter we have a new skill being developed or learned.<br />All of that said, again, it is a decent read. You cold do worse. Yeah, I'm sure you could do better but I'm not very well versed in fantasy stories to be able to say. So I'll probably pick up the 6th book because I am compelled to find out what happens. Truth be told, as lengthy as the book is, it's refreshing to get your money's worth when you buy it. As opposed to some of these 250 pages books, Jordan's sure have a lot of meat on them.<br />A final tidbit about the story. At this point, there are over 30 characters in the book. Each occupies a story line, no matter how trivial the character. Granted, they are often intertwined so we're not reading three dozen narratives at once. Still, there are so many that Jordan left out at least 5 major characters this time. An entire book went by with no mention of Perrin and that story. Mind you, there were 1000 pages in which to do this. That tells you just how laboriously the narrative thickly flows through these 1000 pages.<br />Jordan's acceptance that not all the good guys can get out scot free is a step forward. As is his character development and the more robust final showdown. I still think he's got some work to do in terms of shoring up the details of his story. Every book ending is roughly predictable, and this one is no different. But this is probably worth picking up if you're not sure whether or not you want to continue.	2003-01-24
US	52559350	R1P93O3OJPXLDZ	0738825751	524762201	Half Baked in Taiwan	Books	2	19	22	N	N	Half Baked is Mostly Raw	I gave myself several weeks to sit on this book before I submitted a review. I was so disappointed after reading Half Baked in Taiwan that I didn't want to sit down and immediately start reeling off things that were wrong with it. I wanted to digest it a bit before I reviewed it.<br />Two weeks have passed and I am still annoyed at having read this book. My mistake was being fooled into thinking it was worth the purchase. When I put it on my wish list, I had read nothing but good reviews. When I got it for Christmas, I was excited to read it because of those reviews.<br />As it turns out, I shouldn't have believed the hype. An Internet search leads me to believe that several of the reviews posted here are friends of the author. I was able to find the very same reviews being touted as 'expert reviews' on a website where Mrs. Fowler has some web space along with other authors.<br />So what is wrong with this book? Let me preface this by giving my &quot;credentials&quot;, if you will. My wife, who I have been with for 7 years, is Taiwanese. We have been to the island together twice. She and her entire family were born there. Her immediate family lives in the US and we frequently spend time together. While I do not claim to be an expert on Taiwan, my comments don't come with zero experience either. Additionally, I questioned my wife frequently while reading this book to make sure my annoyances were well founded.<br />I expected this book to be a humorous look at a culture different from our own, but one I am familiar with all the same. I also expected to read a variety of small things the author liked and disliked while living in Taiwan. Instead, I find this text to be a thinly veiled attempt in which the author repeatedly claims Taiwanese people do scores of things the wrong way. Page after page I could not shake the feeling that this was an outlet for her not being happy in Taiwan. <br />For an English teacher, I find the composition to be below average. She should have added another 50 pages to expand her ideas. Too often the reader is left with an unclear notion of precisely what the author is trying to say. The text is often comprised of sentences which are a hybrid between full sentences and poetic verse, even ignoring the untasty dim sum chapters.<br />One reviewer's comment that this book, &quot;By far describes the real Taiwan culture,&quot; is so far removed from reality that I find it almost impossible to believe the reviewer has been to Taiwan as claimed. I see little resemblance between Taiwanese life and that as described in this book.<br />I don't think the author ever truly attempts to immerse herself in the culture in an effort to fully absorb it. As opposed to being a sponge and allowing it seep in, she acts as a raft which floats above it; in contact but not in. She doesn't let the culture become part of her, and the result is her frequently commenting about not understanding various idiosyncrasies of Taiwan; and how things should change to her standards.<BR> <BR>As far as being factually accurate, I find several of the passages either incorrect or deficient. As an avid tea drinker, the chapter on tea can hardly be considered complete as she does not utter the word 'Oolong' once. How one manages to write about tea and Taiwan and not mention Oolong is puzzling, as Taiwan is known primarily for its Oolong tea production. In fact, it's world famous.<br />I feel somewhat bad writing this review because such a meager amount of literature exists discussing Taiwan. Having been there, I enjoy the country and try to read as much as I can about it. But this book is so severely lacking that it's hard for me to recommend it. In fact, it's impossible to do such a thing.<br />In summary, here's how I would typify this book. The last time I was in Taiwan, I was asked how I would describe the country. I said the 3 best things are the tea, the food, and the scenery. The fact that the author only touches on one of these 3 topicsextensively (and does a mediocre job at that) is reason enough to not recommend this. <br />Considering my general opinion of the book, combined with the price, and the paltry 168 pages of text, there's no way I can honestly sit here and say you should buy this book. Those interested in reading about Taiwan would be better off buying Culture Shock, Taiwan by Chris &amp; Ling-Li Bates or the Lonely Planet travel guide by Robert Storey. Both of those give the reader a more accurate narrative on the culture, both are more smoothly written, and both are better values.<br />Half Baked needs more time in the oven. Leave it there and buy a better book.	2003-01-18
US	52559350	R3CES9Y0FZTDI2	0451524934	337991686	1984 (Signet Classics)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A Timeless Classic	Many readers have trouble digesting books that are commonly accepted as classics. Books written many years ago often times fail to resonate with the modern reader. 1984, a book more than 50 years old, is a true classic that anyone can enjoy.<br />Unlike many accepted classics, this is not regal, dry, stuffy, nor thick. 1984 is mostly a light read, with some exception towards the end when Winston starts repeating from 'the book' to Julia. Other than that, words generally flow down the pages, and you quickly find yourself engrossed by the story, such that it becomes hard to put down...and hard to stomach at the same time.<br />Orwell creates a world that is both absurdly terrifying yet strangely familiar. Strangely familiar because of what we see happening right now in our present day history. Orwell proclaimed that he did not think 1984 would happen, but that it could happen. If he were still alive today, he would be no less convinced that it could happen.<br />Today, reality does not give us leadership which is this draconian. 1984 presents a possible reality; a reality that is an extreme case of government gone bad. While I don't see this as our eventual fate, I enjoy the eye-opening approach Orwell takes in creating this story to make his point.<br />The result of his foreboding is eye-opening and fear-inducing. Those familiar with Animal Farm will recognize his ability to paint a very nefarious, yet realistic, scenario in which leaders of any societal order strive to exclude. Those not familiar with Orwell are in for a treat and should read Animal Farm in addition to this.<br />This review is being written in early 2003. At the moment, US politicians are attempting to create legislation which will enable federal agents to track every electronic move that people make. In light of that, this book is a required read. Disregarding that, this book is still a required read.<br />While I do not think this book represents a potential reality, it does highlight the dangerof losing one's freedom to think independently. And in that vein, Orwell forces you to ask questions about the core of humanity and just how far things could possibly go.<br />In perusing some of the 821 reviews of this book, I don't think it's fair to say that this is the best book ever written, or even one of the top 10 for that matter. It is a good book, and one that I highly recommend. But I cannot in good faith call it one of the best ever.<br />The only issue I might have is that Orwell does assume that the average person is so mentally broke that he could allow this to ever happen. I don't know if this was his aim, or if it's to proclaim this *would* happen if the upper echelon got their way. Then again, in the day and age of media-fed TV junkies, perhaps he was more right than he could possibly have known.<br />A very good book and certainly worth the read.	2003-01-17
US	52559350	R12RPVEMLI129A	0802135870	529219733	Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream	Books	5	11	11	N	N	An Exceptional Weave of an Interesting History	In the spirit of the subject matter, the best word to describe this book is...cool. The author appears to have a genuine desire to objectively explore the history, for better or worse, of LSD and its role in American culture. Stevens does not approach this work being for nor against LSD. He just looks. As a result, this book comes out with flying colors...pun intended.<br />This book is a diamond in the rough for those who wish to take that same exploratory approach in reading about LSD and the history of this potent and controversial drug. It's not geared for people who are vehemently pro/anti LSD. Preconceived notions should be checked at the door before embarking on this adventure. <br />Stevens looks at LSD from its very beginnings, where characters such as Hoffman, Osmond, and Huxley help pave the way for much of what comes later in the book. As the narrative moves on, familiar names such as Ginsberg, Leary, Burroughs, Kerouac, Alpert, Metzner, Kesey, Cassady, Weil, Watts, and Wolfe, among others, enter and exit the stage like bit actors in this great showcase. If you've ever been enamored with the doings of any of those names, this book weaves a pattern from threads of various legacies in one fascinating tapestry.<br />As a caveat to the above paragraph, none of those characters is covered in much detail, with the exception of Timothy Leary. This is more a result of Leary's intense involvement with the scene than Stevens' focusing on one extraordinary character. Some of those people (Burroughs, for instance) make very brief but interesting appearances. <br />In addition to those mentioned, many unknown but intriguing characters fill the pages of this book. More than likely, every one of them will lead you to read on, until another name segues into the narrative. Stevens does a great job researching this story and presenting it to the reader in one piece.<br />Every time I review a book I do my best to find something which was lacking, no matter how much I enjoyed it. In this particular case, I have a hard time pinpointing anything to find fault with. The only complaint I might have is that it was too short. One imagines that pages and pages of material never made it to press and it's a shame this book had to end where it did. I would have kept reading if it were twice as long.<br />I do have to cede a point that one other reviewer makes. He comments that the prevalence of 5 star ratings, \\"reflects the weirdness and coolness of the events portrayed rather than the history itself.\\" I do have to lend some credence to that point and admit that this may be true. However, as this subject matter is relatively new to me, the book still rates 5 stars in terms of an introduction to the subject. As a history on the subject, it's the role of the author to tell the story, and Stevens does that well.<br />In all, a great read. A fascinating perspective brought to you by someone trying to elucidate the ups and downs of LSD and the movement it helped create. Again, this is not going to be a favorite of the pro-LSD hippie or the anti-drug conservative. But for those of you who want a fairly balanced, comprehensive view of the history of LSD and how it influenced culture in America, I strongly recommend this book.<br />Very well done.	2003-01-16
US	52559350	R3PNZEYUUL3GWI	0553582917	591020220	Intensity	Books	2	4	10	N	N	Potential Never Realized and Fraught With Silliness	It's hard for me to sit here and say that this book is anything but fairly bad. It has potential, but that potential is never realized. While there are some scenes that make the pages go by rapidly, the majority make you annoyed at having bought the book in the first place.<br />One major problem with this book is that you don't care about the protagonist, Chyna Shepherd. Wrapped up in a psychological never-never land for most of the book, you simply don't find yourself attached to this unlikely heroine. It's not that you want the killer to win. It's just that Vess is infinitely more interesting than Chyna. And that's a major problem of this book from the start.<br />What you do want is a really good (read: creative) reason why Vess is outdone at the end, and perseverance doesn't count. From the 10th page on, you can generally guess what's going to happen. And when the book is over, you'll be right. There's no true suspense with this book when you consider it that way. As you read on, you hope something will come up that you hadn't thought of. But it never does.<br />The otherwise overly-meticulous Vess errs in a manner that is difficult to swallow. No, that's putting it too lightly. It's just plain dumb. Vess doesn't leave a phone in his house for fear that someone might call the police, yet he manages to leave Chyna enough wiggle room to get out of her entrapment. Pure nonsense, especially when you consider all the hubbub built up in Vess' mind about this being, as he calls it, his &quot;flat tire&quot;.<br />I think the story has potential, as I said in the beginning. But Koontz never brings that potential to light. The bones of the story are solid. But the tendons are weak. Under the watchful eye of the careful reader, they snap, leaving only hope of what could have been.<br />The fortuitous series of events that befall the protagonist are silly. And when all is said and done, I found myself not rooting at all for her to get away but for the dogs to finally gether. Why? Because the manner which she jumps that hurdle is just as likely to appear on the next episode of Saturday Night Live.<br />Additionally, too many words and too much time is spent on the details of Chyna's escape. As I said, we all know that she's going to get away. The book would be less appealing if the killer won. So we know she'll best the chains. But does it really need to take over 100 pages of print to happen? And when it finally does, does it really need to be so mundane?<br />What I wanted was more dialogue and more interaction between the 2 characters. Vess and Chyna's conversations were interesting. And while the action scenes also bordered on the inane, at least they were not littered with metaphors that seem to have been taken out of a &quot;Metaphors for Dummies, the Absurd Edition&quot; book. <br />I think the best way to describe this book is as such. Far too often in the story you say to yourself, &quot;Oh, come on.&quot; Time and time again, it's just not believable. Sure, at first you let it go and read on because you're willing to give the author free reign. But after a while it's just hard to take. You can't believe that Koontz couldn't come up with a better way to avoid any particular scene's potential doom.<br />And that's exactly it. Koontz's creativity in this book is severely lacking. Not in the setup; the setup is just fine. Like I said, strong healthy bones. But the transition from in-chains to out-of-chains is littered with silliness. As is the fight with the dogs. And the removal of the door in the basement. And the second fight with the dogs which almost redefines the word ridiculous. And the final scene with Vess, which is also extremely weak.<br />I think that a good and/or patient editor would have used a lot of cutting and slicing and told Koontz to go back and redo a large portion of this to bring it together better. And in that case I think it has the potential to be a solid 4 star book. But that course was not chosen,and this is what the result is.<br />Not really a recommended read.	2002-12-20
US	52559350	R344BHCFSWDI78	0439064864	667539744	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A Good Book, Fun and Light	I'm going to proceed to be one of roughly 3 million people to review this book. \\"Why bother?\\" you ask. Good question. My only reply would be that I might as well lend my voice to the many that have already proclaimed this book as a good one. This book is indeed a good one.<br />The two adjectives that I find most appropriate here are light and fun. This book is light and it's fun. It's also what you expect. I recently did a review of the second book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. A sentiment I expressed was that if you read the first one, you were more than likely going to read the second one. Same goes for this series. If you read (and liked) the first, there's no reason at all not to continue with the series.<br />I'm not going to be specific in describing much about this book and the story within it. There's a boy who's going to wizard school. Need we say more? If you read the first one you know the story. Something bad happens. The boy and his friends try to solve the mystery, breaking just about every school rule along the way. Naturally, an interesting adventure ensures. It's all part of the same general story line that guided the first one.<br />Even though I trivialize the specifics of the narrative, it really is fun to read. One doesn't pick this book up with the idea that Harry Potter is going to lose, do we? Of course not. We all know the hero is going to win, especially when we're reading the second book of a (currently) 4 book series. In order for there to be books 3 and 4 (and presumably 5, 6, and 7 some day), Harry and his cohorts need to succeed.<br />What I find most enjoyable about this series is the simple nature of the text that creates this fun. Rowling does a great job keeping things moving along without bogging down much at all, and for that it really is easy to read. If you don't like silly children's adventures, don't bother. But I doubt you're reading this review if you don't like silly adventures.<br />So this book is not what I would call 5 stars, though I'm sure many people will say it is. To each his own, I believe. For what it tries to do, the book certainly is successful. And you could undoubtedly spend your money in worse ways. It's a fun, light read that you could easily knock out on a weekend afternoon. Well worth the effort in continuing with the Harry Potter series.<br />Certainly recommended.call 5 stars, though I'm sure many people will say it is. To each his own, I believe.

US	52559350	R1W5A59GWUZYSK	0451527364	627065254	The Odyssey (Signet Classics)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An Excellent Tale, Truly a Classic	I find it somewhat odd to be sitting here writing a review of a book that is older than our calendar. I'm not sure when this book was actually written. I suppose nobody really does, or even who the real author is for that matter. All of these facts cause a book review such as this to be held under a somewhat strange circumstance.<br />I'm not going to justify giving this book 5 stars. It is what it is. Thousands, if not millions before me have dubbed it a masterpiece. I'm certainly not going to change the collective consciousness and its opinion of this book in 2002. What I will do with this brief review is try to explain just what this book is and who might be interested in reading it.<br />Simply put, this is a simple story about a simple man and his complex adventure to get home. It's a straightforward tale about man and his relationship with the gods. With this, you get an excellent perspective of what man thought of the gods and how they acted and reacted. How everything was decided by the gods. And how everyone was at the mercy of those gods.<br />The travels away from Ithaca and back to Ithaca are the meat of the book. I'm not going to summarize other than to say that a strong, brave man (Odysseus) finds his was into a number of complex situations. Through these situations he continues to rely on his strength and bravery, of both mind and body, to find a way out of them.<br />What I do find most interesting is that Homer portrays the gods as veritable children in the way they act. Often times they seem no more mature than teenagers that fly off the handle when little things fail to go their way. This is an interesting perspective in terms of personifying these entities that were thought to rule the heavens.<br />As we follow Odysseus, we generally know what will come to pass. Because the oracles and seers and gods want something to happen, there is little chance the prophecies will not come true. These predicted events come to pass as the story moves on. We travel with Odysseus back to where he started while the gods shape his course.<br />The story is simple, while at the same time complex. It's interesting to realize that this was the literature of the time; very basic, very structured, and very grand. One imagines it was a spoken tale that was eventually written down by Homer. Again, I don't rightly know.<br />So why read this book? Well, to be honest I was moved to read this after I saw the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? I was curious to see how closely the story followed. Well, the parallels are obvious and there's no need to go into that. After I was 1/4 of the way through the book, my interest level was beyond what it started as. I suddenly wanted to read the story on its own merit, and not because of the movie.<br />The book is the epitome of what I disliked in college. That was a few years ago, and now I can positively say I very much enjoyed this book. I think a lot has to do with the translation, and WHD Rouse does a sensational job to make his version as timeless as possible. Much of my enjoyment also has to do with the fact I was taking my time, trying to proceed as slowly as I could with the story.<br />I think my final suggestion would be this. Read this if you've got a fairly strong desire to. I know that sounds easy, but my point is this. Don't casually pick it up and decide you're going to read it because you want to read a classic. There are other books which can fill that need. This one demands for you to be in tune with it. If you're not going to try to carefully get through it, I think it could easily bore you.<br />This is a classic that you should read if you're moved to. Otherwise, you could end up being one of the people who swear all of the classics simply stink. But if you do approach it with the right mindset, it can be an extremely enjoyable read.ravel with Odysseus back to where he started while the gods shape his course.<br />The story is simple, while at the same time complex.

US	52559350	R2VKYXSY52G9D7	0345339711	669379389	The Two Towers (The Lord of the Rings, Part 2)	Books	3	2	6	N	N	A Vehicle From Book 1 to Book 3	I think its fair to say that this book is not as good as the first one in the series, nor is it as good as The Hobbit. But as the middle piece of the trilogy of Middle Earth, it serves a method for getting from point A (Fellowship of the Ring) to point B (Return of the King). And in that, it does a good enough job.<br />When it comes down to it, here's the truth of the matter. This is the least enjoyable of the trilogy. But if you're going to read the first and last books, you can't skip the second book. It just doesnt make sense. Too much of the story transpires in book 2, and since the trilogy is ultimately 1 huge book divided into 3 segments, there's no way to skip to book 3 without first stopping at this one.<br />My main problem with this book is that there isnt enough action nor dialogue. It might be better stated that theres too much transition and not enough action. I believe Tolkien does his best work when he's writing about character interactions in any given scene. The Two Towers lacks in presenting the reader with enough of those situations to keep them interested.<br />The story is generally good enough, though at times you do scratch your head. Some of the story lines seem to come to a point where Tolkien didnt know what to do next. I think, all in all, that's how this book struggles the most.<br />The struggle is one of trying to put a few good ideas in book of this length. There simply arent enough of those ideas to make it go as far as it needs to go. With that, it seems to me that Tolkien invents new scenes that enable him to add pages to his story. These scenes often times seem forced, as if he didnt even buy into them.<br />All in all, the book does a fair job as the middle child in this 3 step series. It doesn't bore you to the point of putting it down. Ultimately, the main story line is consistent with the main arrow of the narrative; a narrative which has good doing battle with evil in 2 different arenas.<br />As a stand alone book, this one would never be a keeper. But as it is, this trilogy is not meant to be 3 individual books but 3 read in succession. So there's no need to look at it as a book on its own.<br />This review serves to warn the reader that #2 is not going to be as exciting as any of the other 3 in this story (including the Hobbit). However, since the reader undoubtedly will buy and read the trilogy as one, few people will be reading any review here with an eye towards trying to decide to read this book or not.<br />So proceed on with the trilogy, get ready for a bit of a slower ride than either of the previous 2 books, and chew off as much of this one as you can as you make your way to book #3.s one would never be a keeper.

US	52559350	R26VKKHUOCMDX2	0440369061	725326918	Palm Sunday	Books	3	33	40	N	N	Solidly Average	It's hard to call this book anything but average, especially for Kurt Vonnegut. In fact, when it comes right down to it, it's even hard to call this a book. This is a collection of speeches and assorted writings that have been compiled and thrown together between 2 covers. There is some new material (mainly commentary) intermingled among these speeches and essays. That commentary is probably the most entertaining aspect of the whole book. <br />All in all this rates as an average of all the material included, and that average is no more or less than, well, thoroughly average. 3 stars. By giving it 3 stars I think it says the book is worth reading. But it's clearly not worth getting too excited about. No, this is not one of Vonnegut's greatest works. But it is interesting at spots.<br />In this book Vonnegut touches on all sorts of things, but as many seasoned KV readers will know, it would not be a vintage Vonnegut without mentioning Dresden, Indianapolis, and his son Mark's insanity. All 3 make numerous appearances in the book. It could probably be argued that the name of this book should be exactly that: Dresden, Indianapolis, and Mark's Insanity.<br />But it's not. It's called Palm Sunday for whatever reason. In it, he rates all of his works to date and I think he does a fair job doing so. For this one, he gives himself a C+, which is fair enough. He also said it took 6 years. If time is an indicator, I'll give him an A for effort. <br />Those interested in getting to know Vonnegut from the start should try The Sirens of Titan, Cat's Cradle, or Slaughterhouse-5. Those 3 are vintage Vonnegut and worth every good word ever expressed about them. Those who have read all of his fiction works and are looking to peer even deeper into his writings should indeed read this. But do so with the grain of knowledge that this is not his best collection of words. <br />As much as I have not praised this book it is still worth the read. But I try to paint a fair picture of who should read it. In a nutshell, people who have read many other Vonnegut works should read this one to complete the list of books he has written. Those new to Vonnegut should move on to something more well-crafted and ingenious.<br />My conclusion? Worth the read, but after you've done some other reading first.	2002-11-21
US	52559350	R27FCJJ2DEB05O	1583224890	746847725	9-11	Books	4	54	67	N	N	A Collection of Good Thoughts Shoved Down Your Throat	This book is a series of softball questions seemingly designed for Chomsky to belt out of the political ballpark where well constructed \\"answers\\" are a means of pushing his political agenda which paints the government as nefarious evil doers while casually shrugging off critics as \\"idiotic\\" or \\"laughable\\".<br />This is Noam Chomsky.<br />So why do I rate this book 4 stars? I do so because I have to be honest with anyone who is going to read this review. I will always contend that delivery is a large part of any book. Because of the delivery, this is a 4 star book and not a 5 star book. But it doesn't take away from the underlying message which Chomsky tries to send.<br />What is that message? Anyone familiar with Chomsky will know that his ultimate message is this. Motives and actions of the US government are frequently underhanded and inhumanitarian. He contends that our government routinely practices terrorism (government defined) and that major media outlets ignore the reality of how our government operates in various theaters of the world.<br />Chomsky's message, despite his delivery, is one that is often hard to counter and lined with truth. The hard part about reading this book is that Chomsky demands you believe him 100% and dismisses any disagree with him as uneducated, uncaring, or evil.<br />I think it's easy to see Chomsky as an anti-rhetoric rhetoric machine. In an effort to counter the rhetoric of the US government, he does that which he criticizes. The government says \\"war\\" and Chomsky says \\"slaughter\\". He practices what he claims to despise.<br />A second Chomsky flaw is hand waving off counter arguments. Instead of attempting to debate an argument, he points to other texts and claims that the proof is there. Instead of attempting to take on issues head-to-head, he bobs and weaves with vague references which are not readily available to the reader. <br />My third complaint with Chomsky is his insistence that he knows the unknowable. In one instance hesays the government has a \\"program of silent\\" genocide. Additionally, through the book he states (as fact) what Bin Laden wants to come of the 9-11 attacks, while later claiming there is no proof Bin Laden was involved. Alluding to these facts instead of calling them what they are, namely opinions and speculation, is what he builds many of his points on; points which rest on a suspect foundation.<br />My basic problem with him is that despite it all, this is still a very good book. Chomsky is a good thinker. He is well read, well informed, and sometimes well spoken. He doesn't need to resort to these tactics, yet he does. Chomsky is like a teenager in his maturity level at times, belittling those who don't agree with him and hand waving his way through topics by saying things are so obvious it's foolish to bother explaining.<br />What is good about this book again?<br />Now to some of those points I refer to when I claim he does have a good message beneath the childish rhetoric. Considering the time frame, a mere 7 days after 9-11, Chomsky correctly predicts that Israel would eventually use the Bush anti-terrorist rhetoric to step through a huge hole opened when he declared countries as either with or against the US.<br />In understanding the element involved here, Chomsky also suggests we should strive to apprehend the wrongdoers and attempt to comprehend the forces at play. When Chomsky says we should try to, \\"Understand and address the cause,\\" I'm right there with him.<br />Additionally, he elucidates a great thought which entails the continued oppression by the US and Israel of Iraqi and Palestinian people, respectively. In continuing these oppressive actions, many people look at the US and the Israel with disdain. When Bin Laden speaks out against these acts of oppression, even those who hate Bin Laden identify with him. His latching on to these key points, and the US government's continued actions to support what he says, rally a large part of the Arab worldagainst the US.<br />These are the points that Chomsky brings to light. Similarly, when people, no matter how hated by society, speak out against the US bombing of a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant - the same plant that supplied half the country with its medication - people listen and begin to foster strong hate towards the US. <br />The book helps in giving you a better understanding and perspective of US actions and their consequences. What would US citizens think if they knew what our government was doing in various arenas of the world? Again, it goes back to trying to understand the impetus for 9-11.<br />Chomsky reminds you of the question which occasionally plagues you. Why do we support Saudi Arabia, the center for much of this anti-American sentiment? Why did we support Iraq in the 80's? The Mujahadin in the 80's? Chomsky's point is this. Why do we stop asking these questions even though we know what the answers are?<br />Back to Chomsky. Yes, he is unobjective. He will never present the reader with a balanced picture. Yes, he selectively looks at history through his one-eyed microscope to prove his point, even drawing on history 40 years past to support anti-US opinions of today. And yes, he will beat his selfish \\"I am right you are stupid\\" drum incessantly. <br />But the reality is this. When you cut through all of this, his message is clear and hard to refute. It's not a rosy picture out there, just beyond the fingertips of what you can see, hear, and read every day in the media. The citizens of this country are implicitly supporting these atrocities that go on in the world by not questioning them. And in his petulant and annoying manner, Chomsky reminds you what the questions are and why you should be asking them.<br />I clearly recommend reading this book.	2002-11-17
US	52559350	R3SWMJ9C77H5DY	0345359429	345581260	Battle Cry of Freedom:  The Civil War Era	Books	5	11	11	N	N	An Excellent, Complete, Objective Work	The bottom line on this book is this. This is the most complete, most objective, and most well-researched Civil War book you could possibly hope for. While this book is clearly not for everyone, the Civil War enthusiast who wishes to get an objective view which considers many aspects of this conflict should start by reading this book. In a word, this book is brilliant.<br />I have to disclaim the caveat where I said it was, &quot;Clearly not for everyone.&quot; By that statement I mean the following. Some people might be looking for a recap of only the battles waged in the field. Some people may be looking for a Naval history. Some may be looking for a view of technological advancement. Some may want to focus on political views. Some may want to explore the sociological tides in the Union and Confederacy alike. <br />For the reader who wants only 1 or 2 of those items, the book is not for them. The reason for this is because the book entails all of the above aspects; all of which are investigated objectively. Likewise, this book may not be exactly right for a beginner, as it delves deeply into a complex web of factors that shaped the war from start to finish. If a high interest level is not there, it could easily be overwhelming at first glance. In fact, it took me nearly a year to pick this book up. <br />I don't think I can say enough good things about this book. Every approach McPherson takes seems to be dripping with objectivity. Even widely held beliefs he dissects, with an attempt to get to the core of truth. And when a strict answer does not present itself in his inquiries, he presents both sides and lets the reader decide.<br />This book is long. In order to encapsulate this many aspects of the war (in addition to ones I assuredly have missed), a tremendous number of pages needs to be devoted to the subject. Over 800 pages from start to finish. The subject matter is approached at a medium-high level of intelligence such that the reader feels his efforts andconclusions were derived from a fair amount of contemplation.<br />I have read the 4 reviews that have not given this book a 4 star rating or higher. I think that a few general themes emerge with those complaints. The first is that this book is not perfect. While I do think this book is tremendous, I agree that the book is not perfect. No 800 page book will be perfect. Another thing I note is that several of the people who rate the book poorly did not read it fully. They cite examples of McPherson's failings that are simply incorrect. <br />I do find interesting the claims that this book is written through glasses colored by the tint of the Civil Rights movement of the late 1960's. While I can neither confirm nor deny this, the approach that McPherson takes in this book is a reasonable one and people are bound to disagree with things that they don't want to believe. Claims that this book has an anti-South slant to it are generally unfair, in my opinion. Neither North nor South come out of this looking morally superior. The only complaint that I can possibly lend credence to is that of McPherson's giving slavery too much of a role in the conflict. This is, perhaps, where claims of his Civil Rights involvement cloud his complete objectivity.<br />However, the above does not detract from the excellence of the book enough to warrant anything but a 5 star rating. I find most, if not all, complaints about this book to be generally unfair, and unrepresentative of what is contained in this work. While the book is not perfect, it strives to make sense of a very complicated subject matter and does a very good job doing that. Very highly recommended.	2002-11-14
US	52559350	R357MN62HSUCP	0440222451	915649406	Immediate Action: The Explosive True Story of the Toughest--and Most Highly Secretive--Strike Forc e in the World	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good Solid Book About Every Day SAS life	As a preface, let me begin by saying I read Bravo Two Zero (by the same author) before I read this. Having read this second, this was a bit of a letdown. I was expecting a similar sort of amazing story to emerge from this book when I picked it up. While this book, on its own, was a good read from front to back, it really doesn't stand up to the excitement that Bravo Two Zero delivers.<br />However, I realize that it's not fair to compare the two and I will try to do my best in keeping them separate. One is a single amazing story behind enemy lines in Iraq, while the other is a series of smaller narratives pertaining to what life is like in the British SAS. This book lacks the explosiveness of the other, but has more of a complete picture of what the Regiment (as McNab refers to it) is like on a day to day basis.<br />If you're looking for a glimpse into the daily life of the British SAS, this book is for you. If you're looking for something of the same caliber as Bravo Two Zero, this isn't the same sort of thing. Consider yourself fairly warned.<br />Having prefaced that, quite lengthily, I did enjoy this book. It is a solid read. McNab does a good job portraying what Regiment life is like and the various degrees of action he saw while he was part of it. It's not filled with \\"shoot 'em up\\" Hollywood-style action scenes. Far from it. In fact, McNab explains that many times their mission is to never fire their weapons lest they expose themselves prematurely and risk the success of the mission.<br />The book really sets you straight in a lot of ways. Gone are the notions that special forces teams exist to kill first, second, and third. As McNab says, there are times when it becomes necessary, but by and large, killing is not what it's all about. Finishing the mission is.<br />Another aspect I like about this book is that we see a realization by McNab that he screwed up his married life time and time again. By devoting himself so fully to the service he was part of, hedidn't realize until much later that he was paying no mind to his current wife. All the while, his marriage was going down the tubes. It's refreshing to see him be able to look back and shoulder the blame for that.<br />His observations of third world cultures are enlightening also. Often times we think that everything to be had is here in the Western world. McNab comes to the realization that the cultures of many of these societies are simple, yet complex. Again, I mention this because as a reader, I was surprised and refreshed at the perspective McNab is able to bring as a member of a special forces team.<br />Again, this book is a very good read. I recommend it. I give it 4 stars because it's not what I was expecting coming into it. There are times when it tends to bog down in the mundane, every day life of just being a soldier. But overall, it's a good read which I enjoyed from start to finish. Definitely recommended.	2002-09-21
US	52559350	R14M2FRG40TMTV	0345343352	824356830	Side Effects	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Entertaining	I think the best aspect of this book is that the stories are very short. I'm not saying that in commentary to Allen's writing ability. I just think it's the truth. After a while, the non-sequiter style humor begins to grate you. It's funny for a time. But then it fades into teenage repetitiveness.<br />The book is a good toilet reader. Easily digestible bites of writing over a fairly short book make reading a chapter in 5-10 minutes possible. Likewise, reading stories in quick succession turn the book from a quick bit of mindless entertainment to a bit of a chore to get through.<br />Not all of the stories are non-sequiter nonsense, but most are. They're generally light, filled with references out of left field, and are usually funny enough to warrant a laugh. This essentially typifies everything I have read from Allen.<br />I think, in general, the book gets better from front to back. So if you can get by the initial 3-4 shorts you'll be fine all told. Don't expect a great book by any stretch. It's clearly not that. But it's funny, light, and easy enough to read.	2002-07-31
US	52559350	R2D5BXT3583DQL	0896086194	868154879	Iraq Under Siege: The Deadly Impact of Sanctions and War	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A Very Eye Opening Book	The problem with any anti-rhetoric/hyperbole book is falling into rhetoric and hyperbole yourself. I find that most, if not all, anti-government and big business narratives do exactly that - at least to some degree. While this book does show some flashes of that, it does not turn into an anti-US diatribe so much as it presents the facts and allows the reader to come to his own anti-US stance with the help of the facts.<br />This is a very good book. Anyone who is truly concerned with the fortune and situation of people around the world need to look no further than this book to get a better understanding of what the US policies truly are when it comes to Iraq. Entering this book, I tried to maintain an open mind in regards to the pro and anti-sanctions arguments. After this book, I cannot feel anything but disdain for the US government and it's policies in this particular situation.<br />A collection of 16 articles or narratives, the book gives the reader a diverse perspective on the anti-sanctions viewpoint. While certainly not an objective analysis of the sanctions, there are first hand accounts of the suffering, countless statistics and quotes which denigrate the sanctions, and logical attacks on official US policy.<br />The level of any particular narrative in the book ranges from somewhat sophomoric (I'm trying to be fair) to extremely well presented. With any collection of essays like this, there's going to be quite a diverse range of viewpoints. Of course, they do share one thing in common, and that is the anti-Iraq sanctions are directly responsible for many, many deaths and have not hurt the regime that official US policy states is the goal.<br />After reading this book, you'll more than likely be able to debate anyone who argues that pro-sanction policy is the way to achieve the ends of ousting the current Iraqi government. It's not a very hard argument to win, really. But the collection of facts widely available are really put together in this book and certainly make you open your eyes to the horrors that the US government are perpetuating on a daily basis.<br />The bottom line is that policy such as this is why we are objects of attacks such as that of September 11, 2002. Our government is fostering an anti-US hate in the world that comes to a head with tragic consequences like 9/11. While the misguided actions of a few zealots do not speak for the millions and millions of people who fall under the US umbrella of oppressive foreign policy, these are the actions that foster such hate. And as such, this book is a good exercise for the reader in understanding why a lot of that hate exists in the first place.<br />If I had it my way, literature such as this would be required reading in schools across the nation. While there are some aspects of the book I would attempt to round out in an effort to make it more objective, the overall effect of this book is an excellent one - it opens your eyes to the suffering that people in Iraq endure at the hands of our government.<br />Very much recommended.	2002-07-11
US	52559350	R1MCU350DAWNUM	156858217X	487897349	Steal This Book	Books	2	17	26	N	N	At Best, An Interesting Study of the Time	I find this book to generally be an interesting study of what was popular in the so-called counter-culture when this book was written. But ultimately, the book is a contradiction in direction and a collection of anti-American hyperbole with ways to become a worse person and ultimately make society a lesser place to live.<br />Now, the above statement is not a commentary for those who believe this way. There are times when I still feel anger at the actions of the corporate world and the government alike. But I don't promote peace while preaching ways to kill another person with a knife, like Hoffman does.<br />I strongly agree with one reviewer who says that, \\"The book is rife with ignorance, teenage angst, and--especially--hypocrisy.\\" What you have here is a book which really rallies against nothing but a generic idea which can be summed up with the expression, \\"Things I don't like.\\" By attempting to rally the American youth by saying we are all brothers and sisters, he holds on to this thin veil of togetherness while teaching you ways to blow things up.<br />Most annoying is Hoffman's continued insistence on using the expressions \\"Pig Empire\\" and \\"Amerika\\" as if these acts of defiance justify his position. All they do is paint himself in the corner of the teen angst the above reader mentioned.<br />Again, I'm not supporting business and government. But this approaches presented in this book are mindless and equally oppressive. Essentially, he wants the world to fall into anarchy where you just take, by force if necessary, whatever you want.<br />I find the book an interesting study on the culture of the times. Not so much because of what's in it, but because of the fact that you can read this book with the knowledge that it was something that was marvelled at from the time period. Other than that, there are a lot of other books that are worth the time above and beyond this one.	2002-07-04
US	52559350	RLCWH7AZAAVZX	0440218802	371573172	Bravo Two Zero: The Harrowing True Story of a Special Forces Patrol Behind the Lines in Iraq	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An Excellent Book	I like to think that I am a tough reviewer of books. To me, books are supposed to be what they say they are. If I'm reading a fantasy, I want to read about some wild land with a great story, good details, and witty dialog. If I'm reading a biography, I want pure objectivity. Same with a history book, don't give me a one sided obsessive story about history.<br />Having said that, this book clearly blows away any and all expectations I had going in. From roughly page 100 on, this book is so amazing, so unbelievable, and so riveting that I could not put it down - literally. I began driving to work the long way so I could read at red lights. I would read while brushing my teeth at night. I would read on my lunch break at work. It's been a long time since any book has captivated my like this.<br />On the cover of the book is the statement, \\"The Most Incredible Story You'll Ever Read.\\" While this is a strong statement, it lived up to it for me. It really stands as one of the most incredible stories I have ever read. Granted, this is only the second book of this ilk that I have read (Black Hawk Down was the first), but it really was amazing.<br />I'm not going to give away the story/plot of the book. You get all you need to know from the fact that it deals with a British SAS unit which goes into Iraq during the brief war in 1991. Stuff happens. Really, it's not my story to tell. The editorial reviews above detail the story better (and more in depth) than I can do here. What I'm trying to do is give you an idea if the book met my expectations and if the experience in reading it was good or bad.<br />This book is well written, it displays an amazing set of circumstances that this team went through, and it gives you a real insightful look at how the SAS team operates. The author is the same man who led the expedition, so the information is first rate. In addition, you learn a good amount about the culture of the \\"enemy\\" of the moment, namely the Iraqis.<br />As an exercise incompleteness, I read the reviews which gave this book low ratings. I find that reading the ratings are a fair way to look at the good and bad reviews any book gets and better solidify or objectify my view. I did not find a thing to sway me from the 5 star rating. Yes, there are British expressions in the book that can be confusing at times. But this is a small detail that should not deter you. <br />A really, really good book. Highly recommended.	2002-05-16
US	52559350	R194L2AGS8P8YC	0465097200	39953810	Anarchy, State, and Utopia	Books	2	12	54	N	N	Very academic, very poorly presented	Nozick may or may not be a genius. I'll never know. Why will I never know? Because the man has no ability to actually convey a thought in a method of communication that I find easy to digest. As a thinker, he might be great. As a writer, he clearly needs some work. I felt like I was reading a contract.<br />So, I profess that I did not finish the book. I read roughly half of it before I decided that my time was not worth it. It was painful.<br />As to the text of the book, Nozick wavers between having some interesting thoughts and some purely academic/unrealistic thoughts. One problem with the book is the philosophy that puts individual rights as the main assumption. In fact, that's the first sentence. As a fellow member of Earth, I have to ask where this is based. Sure, his philosophy rests on it, but many later thoughts do not build upon earlier thoughts. Often there is not a procession of ideas, but new ones that spring from this initial one. In other words, there is little building and more jumping to new conclusions based on the same assumption. A very flat thought pattern, of you will.<br />But the clearer problem with this outlook is that he completely overlooks human nature in trying to set up a minimal state. All one needs to do is look at our current system of government to see that corruption is a human element. Where power exists, people gravitate to. Power corrupts. I believe this sentiment to be true and Nozick never, in my mind, covers this piece of human nature.<br />As evidence of his thoughts on people's tendency to violate one another, all one needs to do is look at his first section, where Nozick painstakingly defines how frequently one may have his rights violated. If such a comprehensive effort is made to investigate the numerous ways of rights violations, one can only assume that there is a fear that people will innately abuse any right of power that they may get in the minimal state.<br />There are some good thoughts in the book. In particular, I get a kick out of the question, why is blackmail illegal? It's a good question. Isn't silence just a service rendered? Another good thought is his questioning of rules of war. While a passing thought, it is a good one. The rules of war remove the rules of everyday life. Of course, for every good thought in the book there is a poor one. <br />For every yin, there is a yang, so to speak. But I say that with a grain of salt because we're not dealing with a yin-yang text, more of a Newton Law-ish text where every good thought has an equal and opposite bad thought.<br />All in all, I might give the book 3 stars. But since the words are entrenched in obfuscation, I have to say it's 2 stars. One main reason we put words together is to convey an idea to another. When you refuse to play by the rules of communication, you fail in that communication. A book is the ultimate interface of communicating via written words. Nozick fails miserably in that communication.	2002-05-16

Books	3	10	14	N	N	Somewhat Confused, but still good	I once watched a movie, \\"Very Bad Things.\\" The problem with the title of this movie is that it could easily be turned into a negative review headline: \\"Very Bad Things is a Very Bad Movie.\\" You see where this review is going? Michael Moore is a Stupid White Man.<br />Now, far be it from me to lay the blame on Moore himself. I too, am a Stupid White Man for buying this book. ....<br />In reality, the book does have some good things in it. Actually, it has a lot of good things in it. At times, I laugh, because he's being funny with some of his comments. Then he goes overboard and actually tries to suggest that men are trying to kill off women with cigarettes. Now let's be real. In the midst of what seems to be a serious, albeit bad, argument against men, he just starts spouting off figures and \\"facts\\" that are roughly as accurate as a 4-year-old's crayon depiction of the New York City skyline. <br />This book typifies the adage that if you give a monkey a brain, he thinks he rules the world. While funny at times, it's just as often overbearing and downright idiotic. Those looking for the Noam Chomsky from this book will be disappointed, because he dives into the ridiculous too often. Those looking for Dave Barry will be disappointed, because he tries to dive into the serious too often. He does neither that that well nor completely. <br />But again, this is a piece of entertainment value. I do laugh at times. And some of the things he says are very pertinent and extremely worthwhile. But the reality is that he could have summed up the serious side of this book in about 50 pages and it would have been an explosive 50 pages at that. But then he goes on to add 220 or so pages to make it wacky and colorful to help sell it to...the Idiot Nation.<br />If he were to take one approach or the other (Chomsky or Barry) I think this book would be worth a lot more than it is. Because he does actually ask some very good questions, he does raise some very good points, and he does make you think. At the same time, he throws in red herring facts all over the place. As Twain said: Lies, damned lies, and statistics.<br />...<br />...<br />Anyway, it's kinda tough to mix Noam Chomsky and Dave Barry. In fact, Moore proves that it's impossible.	2002-05-16

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	3	50	50	N	N	Good narrative, not always on the mark	... <br />In referencing some of the facts, the descriptions proffered seem to be fairly on the mark, but not always. While it is nice to read a book written with conviction, as this book is, you always have to be careful as to what is true and what is a stretch. Also, as a side note for the authors, it would be nice to not have to hear over and over about the husband's martial arts penchant.<br />I think the authors portray the average Taiwanese person as a bit more anti-Westerner, rude, harsh, and unforgiving than they really are. My experience with many Taiwanese is that they are more than happy to talk to you (if they spesk English) as long as you are willing to smile and open up. This is not a population of money-first, anti-white people. Sometimes I think the text intones this sentiment.<br />Thus the notion that the average foreigner will not be liked is not true, at least in my opinion. It has been my experience that in Taipei, where you will likely spend some (if not all) of your time, you will not be ogled and thought of as a freak, as plenty of non-Taiwanese exists there. In more rural settings, this may certainly be the case, as it was for me. (As a side note, if you are black you likely WILL be ogled no matter where you go.)<br />I think the issues discussed with saving face would make the visiting business person very careful in not [messing] up, as it were. While there is the notion of face, certainly, it is not the be all and end all of the Taiwanese lifestyle. If one were to proceed with such caution, the timidness of the traveller would certainly be poicked up and would cause judgement to be made for the worse.<br />Those are some problems I have with the book. All in all, there's not a ton of material written about Taiwan, so stacked up against its competition it fares rather well. As an absolute comparison, it could be more inclusive.<br />I did like the book. It does touch on a lot of issues that would be helpful for someone visiting the country. As a learning tool about Taiwan, this is just as good a start as any short of marrying a Taiwanese man or woman and spending time there. Many issues are briefly covered, but not too briefly to get any substance out of them.<br />All in all, I recommend it.	2002-04-15
US	52559350	RTL2DO3G25SRP	0385333870	197148998	Galapagos: A Novel (Delta Fiction)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Very good, patently satirical Vonnegut	At one point in my life, I thought this was just a brilliant book. One of the best ever written. Now that I'm slightly older, I still like it, but I think it's a slightly more cynical, less brilliant novel than it once was...in my mind.<br />It's safe to say that all the essentiall Vonnegut trademarks are present: cynicism, satire, humor, intelligence. But each of those elements falls off from his best work. If I could, I would give this a 3.5, because it's a little better than a run of the mill 3 and not quite as good as a 4.<br />I like the metaphors of the 6 eventual mothers of mankind breaking the egg barrier by sheer luck. And that of the umbillical cord tethering the ship to the mainland. Yes, they are clever, but Vonnegut makes sure he hits you over the head with comment after comment on these, making sure the reader gets just how humankind's current life began and how similar it is to birth.<br />Also, you have to admire the Darwinian bashing done by the irony of natural selection having nothing to do with what we will become and having it happen on an island where Natural Selection was born. Again, all the Vonnegut elements are there. Pure Vonnegut. Excellent.<br />But it seems that Vonnegut gets too caught up in his own cleverness and dwells on it too much. Either that or he expects the reader to not get his ideas to begin with. The novel moves slowly, essentially spinning circles around the idea that our big brains are such a problem in our current stations. Well, current as you and I are in now. But the story so dwells on this, that we lose momentum. We lose focus. We wander around waiting for something more pertinent to happen. Unfortunately, it never really does.<br />This book has the fodder to be a brilliant novella. But spread over a full length book, it looses some of that. For better or worse, this is how it was packaged up and put to pasture. It's a good read. Ironic. Cynical. Satirical. Funny. Just not the utmost of any of those.<br />I would recommemd this to previous Vonnegut readers, not to Vonnegut newcomers.	2002-03-16
US	52559350	R1LEE1DD4XQ6S4	0295980508	85903692	Afghanistan's Endless War: State Failure, Regional Politics, and the Rise of the Taliban	Books	2	5	11	N	N	An academic work bogged down by poor delivery	I have to say before I start this review that this is not going to be nearly as glowing as the other reviews on this book. There's a good reason for that (in my opinion of course). My reason being that there is more to writing a book than painstaking research, which Goodson obviously went through in putting this research paper together.<br />And that is exactly what this is. A research paper. A thesis. A highly academic look through Goodson's eyes of where Afghanistan was, where Afghanistan is, and where it might be going (previous to 9-11 though). The ideas in the book are not terrible. But the lack of presentation and the lack of direction in drawing these facts together make this book an overly architected but poorly built book.<br />Words are chosen by an auther to deliver a point or a message, not to continuously annoy the reader at their lack of cohesive direction (the list of people and organizations is tough to stomach). While reading any narrative, for example, one might expect to find the expression, \\"neghboring countries\\" in the text somewhere. But throughout this book the expression is eschewed for such un-cohesive comments as \\"outside actors.\\" The book rapidly sinks into academic rhetoric at an apparent lack of direction.<br />The first reviewer (Tom Lum Forest) nails it when he quotes Goodson and says that it is, \\"a solid if unspectacular style.\\" In the quote he chooses, three consecutive sentences contain the expression, \\"Cold War.\\" That's out of 3 sentences. As a reader, I need more than that. I need a delivery. I need to be sold on his message and works.<br />Again, there is a world of research in this book. But the delivery fails miserably and as one reviewer says, some may find it \\"sterile\\". You almost have to be a scholar on Afghanistan to read this book and delve into it without being defuddled by his local dialectual tidbits thrown in the text, which serve to do nothing more than derail his message.<br />Point is this. It's a graduate textbookwith a soft cover. If you are immersing yourself in Afghanistan to write a book about the socio-political situation of the country, this is the book for you. If you want a warm up to the country and some general ideas about something you might not already have a wealth of information on, most certainly do not buy this book.	2002-02-25
US	52559350	R291KCGD7BJNGU	0345368436	772657774	Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic	Books	3	6	10	N	N	Good enough	What do I mean by \\"good enough\\"? Exactly that. At a paltry 250 sparsely spaced pages (or should that be densely spaced and sparsely worded?) this boook takes you all of one afternoon to read. And looking at it in those terms, it's worth the sit down. But little more.<br />As you discover in the intro by Adams, the book is in parallel with the game (which I have not played). And in those terms, Jones does a great job in making you feel like you're playing a game in book form...with the minor problem that you can't actually control the characters. Ok, so that's a flaw.<br />But seriously, if you expect an Adams-esque read that is based on an adventure video game, well then you won't be disappointed. The style is very much like later Adams works, so you hardy notice any difference between Jones and Adams. Now, one should not confuse this with early Adams work. Because it's clearly more scatterbrained and even more over the edge that his early works were.<br />Adams used to write with a quirkiness that amused the reader. Jones writes with a quirkiness that annoys the reader at times. There's a fine line between being funny and having little to say but saying it dressed up in drag and squalking like a chiken. Jones crosses that line a tad too often for my tastes and as a result, you find yourself thinking, \\"Get on with it already.\\"<br />All in all, I have to stand by my 3 star rating because coming into it, my expectations were very low for this book...and so should yours be. I bought it at a bookstore down the road for $... in the bargain bin. I think that's all you need to say so far as expectations go. They were not great.<br />With that in mind, the book entertained sufficiently. And it very much resembled a video game structure so far as plot goes. And it was short, so I did not spend too much of my life being mildly amused at times. <br />To use a phrase that others have in various reviews I have read, you could spend yout time in a lot worse ways. Naturally, the reverse can be said. Essentially, proceed at your own risk.	2002-02-17

The same goes for this book, which is good, but not 4.5 star material. If I could give it 3.5, I would, because that's where I think it is so far as fantasy goes.<br />I like the book. I do. Jordan is able to keep me turning pages from page 200 to page 900. The first 200, however, are painfully slow as he attempts to bring those people who have not read the first 3 up to speed. For those previously uninitiated into the Wheel of Time series, it's probably helpful. But for those of us who have read his other works, it's a slow, dry stretch of pages.<br />The book does get more interesteing after that, and Jordan does have a decent way with words that makes the pages go faster. But some of his literary tricks are just plain tiring. As another reviewer asked, how many times can a woman fold her arms under her breasts and how many men's faces are carved out of stone? Similarly, is it really necessary to continuously portray the characters as 12 years old? The maturity level of the characters is severely lacking, which is more pronounced in the beginning of the book than the last 3/4 of it, but nonetheless something that never ends.<br />Conversely, there are some plots that are worth reading. Perrin's saga is good. Min is a great character. And of course we always want to know mroe about Rand. And that's where the problem begins. All in all, this is 1000 pages where Rand accomplishes as much as you could read in 50 pages. And that's where my real problem starts to come in with this book. <br />Nobody ever dies. Characters keep being added. At this stage, there is war raging all over the world and not 1 of nearly 40 characters ever dies. They're only ever grazed or nicked. Not that I'm rooting for anyone to die, you see. But every battle is the same formula: Describe slow anticipation, start the battle, then in 2 pages of action end the battle in a nondescript manner.<br />And yes, I said 40 characters that are entreneched in this book. And 7 different plot lines (Rand, Perrin, Min, Nynaeve/Elayne, Black Ajah, Whiteclocks, Padain Fain, the White Tower, and the Forsaken/Dark One). Well, make it 9, and that keeps Matt, Thom, and several other characters out of it. Among those 8 plot lines I can count can count 37 characters that are running with some story. Nothing ever ends. Even when Rand battles at the end, there is no finality. <br />So, in reviewing the book, I'm not sure it's worth even 3 stars. Maybe more like 2.5 or 2. I don't want to say it totally sucked, especially the Two Rivers part of it all. But the remained of the book was clearly lacking, not nearly enough of the plot talks about Min and her role in the overall picture. <br />I think it is best left at this. Around page 900 I was looking forward to book #5. After the last 100 pages, I'm not really looking forward to it quite so much because the ending was so lame and predictable, the payoff of 1000 pages just was not there.	2002-02-10

The book is good, don't get me wrong. But 5 stars? Not remotely close. 4 stars? I would say not due to it's unbalanced view of history. Are there good points? Clearly there are a great many accounts of things our government does wrong. But just as there are good points, there are bad points as well. Let me start with those.<br />It's bothersome that he gets some very basic facts wrong, such as the way Crazy Horse got his name. Crazy Horse's father was named Crazy Horse. Yet Brown goes into some mythical explanation of where it came from. There are other points in the book he does this.<br />Referring to Crows that work for the whites as &quot;mercenaries&quot; bothers me as well. Don't people question the loaded nature of the word &quot;mercenary&quot;? Why were they not opportunists? Especially since the Crows were always at war with the Sioux? But when a Native American took arms against another in the name of the white, he adopted the bad traits Brown unilaterally gives white settlers in this book.<br />Brown never explores the cultures that led conflicts to end the way they do. He does not explore the fact that white history does not act like Native American in that 1 or 2 deaths is bad. There are deep underlying cultural causes to explore here that he does not. However, this is not a Brown specific problem. Most Indian books ignore this.<br />Brown totally glosses over the reality of how Lewis and Clark were treated by the Nez Perces. He claims that they were totally gracious and accomodating hosts when the reality was that stealing from the white was commonplace.<br />As in his &quot;mercenary&quot; use, there are always loaded adjectives that taint the narrative to say what he wants and not paint a factual picture. Saying things like Victorio was &quot;slaughtered&quot; instead of killed.<br />Saying that it was acceptible for the Modocs to &quot;tax&quot; the whites as they stole items from them was a gross justification by Brown.<br />Finally, the way he states Canad &quot;treated&quot; Sitting Bull. He complained that the US would not just leave the Hunkpapas alone. But when Canada did exactly this, he complains about it as well. There is no consistency with his work.<br />Ok, so those are the bad things. What about the good things?<br />Brown very successfully highlights the problems just about every Indian chief had in dealing with wiser elders and more reactionary youths. This continued rock/hard place scenario plays itself out in chapter after chapter.<br />The above is the well done in the book and really shows the youth versus the old and stands as a commentary to the ongoing theme of social unrest in society and its inherent nature as youth does not have the wisdom of age.<br />Brown highlights the irony of the Comanche history of planting food, then being driven out, then being told they should be planting crops. Very poignant and indicative of the US government in how they treated the natives.<br />Brown also documents well the continued destroying and ignoring of treaties. This is interesting because the US does the same thing today.<br />Brown's book is painfuly researched. This much is clear. But it bothers me that after so much research, an indian death is a slaughter and a white death is revenge. He paints every Native American as an innocent bystander forced to protect himself and every white as an Indian hating racist.<br />Again, there are good points to the book. But you have to be very careful of the loaded nature of it. I would recommend reading this after you have red several other West/Indian books.a gross justification by Brown.<br />Finally, the way he states Canad &quot;treated&quot; Sitting Bull.

US	52559350	R3CSIUI7V0USIR	0618002227	669379389	The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, Part 1)	Books	4	8	17	N	N	A good book, but not sensational	There are some good and bad things to say about this book. The first of which is probably this. I think it's unfair that some people call this the greatest series of books ever written. Then again, in looking at some of the reviews, calling it total garbage is also unfair as well.<br />In all, this is a good fantasy book. However, I must caution that if you are really into fantasy, this is not going to do it for you. Why? Well, really it has mostly to do with the fact that there is no one main character that can overcome everything. When the chips are down, so to speak, hope, luck, and a little ingenious intervention must be used by the &quot;good guys&quot; to escape trouble.<br />This isn't to say the book does not have it's negatives, because clearly it does. But let's start with a positive and go from there. The first is that this is a very rich story. Of course, this is part of it's downfall too. There is a lot of history that only a Lord of the Rings scholar would be interested in or would be able to follow. The lore of the ring is one thing. But every character's history is handed down to the reader. Is it rich? Yes. Is it very hard to follow? Well, if you don't want to take notes, yes.<br />Along these lines, one of the biggest complaints I see from people is that Tolkein should have handed this story to someone else to write, and I can see that perspective. There are a lot of flowery yet empty descriptions. But for me that wasn't too much of a turnoff. In mentally building a scene, I like to have it painted before me. Still, there were times when I was edgy to get the narrative moving. There were other times when I was downright bored by the lack of action.<br />Bringing that thought around again, however, it leads me to proclaim that this narrative is more believable in that fashion. Classic fantasy books have balls to the wall action from cover to cover. This is not the case here. As such, this is more believable as a story that does really exist somewhere and Tolkein merely related that story to our world. The action is not overly sensational. Nothing is &quot;over&quot; anything. Of course, this is what makes people like it less.<br />The ending of the book is dreadfully slowr. This is something that I take issue with. Someone else mentioned that there is no character development, and I think this is true. But I also think it's true that there doesn't need to be character development in what equates to a journey of a ring with a various number of escorts.

I think they add little to the story and only sevre to derail the reader who genuinely wants to see the story develop, not take another detour into history or a different tangent altogether. I wouldn't mind songs entirely, I don't think. But some are 3 pages long and read very dry.<br />Ok, so those are my complaints, which started out as what was supposed to be a positive. Well, the positives are that the book is very enjoyable if you don't want a big strong lead character to destroy every foe in his wake.

Some things take digesting.<br />I would recommend this book for just about anyone. Of course, you should read the Hobbit first, as it is the prequel to this series. The Hobbit is a bit more enjoyable than the first read but a tad younger in its target audience, I believe. This first part of the Lord of the Rings is a solid first step, but moves a bit more slowly and contains a fair amount of info not needed to really get at the unfolding narrative in front of you.e and Tolkein merely related that story to our world. The action is not overly sensational. Nothing is &quot;over&quot; anything. Of course, this is what makes people like it less.<br />The ending of the book is dreadfully slowr. This is something that I take issue with. Someone else mentioned that there is no character development, and I think this is true. But I also think it's true that there doesn't need to be character development in what equates to a journey of a ring with a various number of escorts.

US	52559350	RB7LN8GGK7UTB	0671521101	300599240	Sahara	Books	3	8	8	N	N	A bit too long, somewhat sub-Cussler	Not sure what happened with this book but I think in all, as the title says, it was about 100 pages too long and is clearly off the mark for a Cussler novel. At the end, you get the feeling that Dirk Pitt is eventually going to save the Earth from crashing into the moon with a straw and 4 pounds of cabbage.<br />Not to trash Cussler too much because he has written some solidly mind-numbing escapism novels before that have made you feel the old &quot;USA USA&quot; chant run through your head. But this one seems to be a little further over the edge of reality than his normal work.<br />I read Cussler as a way to not think when I read and he usually does a good job. But this novel went on a bit too long and after a while, too many things came together for the story to unfold as it did. Yeah, I know that there is always some form of historical infringement on Dirk Pitt's adventuire. But this was way too much convergence in one place.<br />Ok, so that's that. But really this is a typical Cussler novel with a bit more &quot;stuff&quot; than usual. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying it has more Cussler. Maybe he had switched from decaf that month. Maybe he had a page quota. Who knows.<br />Anyway, Dirk and Al are there. And of course they meet up with an impractically impossible situation. And they defeat it. It's the usual stuff for these 2 guys who always seem to find their way in and out of trouble. It's fun. It's crazy. And as usual it's entertaining in the way that Cussler speaks with these 2 guys. Dialogue is always so deadpan and self-assured.<br />And while I think that the historical stuff is a bit overdone, it still is pretty neat and it takes a good twist to bring it all together. Just because it's too much does not mean it doesn't work for the desired effect. Especially if you have no problem suspending disbelief. A lot.<br />Would I recommend this book? Yeah, I think so. But not before you read some of the other Cussler titles first. One other reviewer said that he actually laughed at some of the plot development. Well, that's pretty much basic Cussler. Some of the coincidences are crazy, but that's the author's style.	2001-12-04

A round trip in the book, yet a beginning to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A round trip, yet an intro into Middle Earth. A spectacular story about a Hobbit, his journey, and a ring.<br />As you can see, there have been over 900 reviews of this book. All told, this book has a 4.5 star rating. What can I say that will change your mind on this? What can I say that has not been said already? Most likely nothing. I can shed no new light on this piece of fiction. All I can do is chime in with an opinin that has already been stated but by using other words. This book is excellent.<br />Well, so be it. The book is a great read. It's a great tale in a great locale. This book is certainly required reading for anyone who reads various genres. Be it normally fantasy, sci-fi, history, or satire, I'd be surprised if you picked up this book and did not at least like it.<br />Is this a high level brain teaser? No. Is this going to change the world? No. Are your problems going to be solved after you read this book? I doubt it. This book is an escape, an escape into the world that JRR Tolkein pulled from his mind's eye and thrown down on paper. This is the intro to that world he saw. And what a great advaneture it is.<br />I'm not into revealing polt when I write reviews. I think that's silly stuff and I don't want to be told what to expect when I read a review. However, you have to give hints. And the book here is all about an adventure. An adventure that goes over hills, under hills, and around them. An adventure that meets with various good and bad people/things. An adventure that sometimes goes well, and seomtimes not. An adventure that finds its way to the lair of a dragon and his hordes of gold. This adventure is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but only a small find by Bilbo along the way links the 2. That and the wizard Galdalf.<br />In reading this for the first time in about 10 years, I found it just as interesting as the first time, if not a lot easier to blaze through the pages. The writing is fantasy. You could easily digest this whole book in a solid day if you wanted to. And it would be a crime to do so because then the adventure would be over barely after it began.<br />The only point of my review is this. Read it. Even if you hate it (which you probably won't), this is something you should have read in your lifetime. If you are 10 or 100, it is a fun book to pick up. It appeals to all ages and is something that no home library should be without. I can say I've read American history, Tom Robbins, Kurt Vonnegut, Doglass Adams (and Coupland), Middle Eastern history, as well as other fantasy books and escapism novels from the likes of Clive Cussler. And this belongs on my book shelf just as much as any of those.s the first time, if not a lot easier to blaze through the pages. The writing is fantasy.

US	52559350	R1NFY3XL5H2I7G	0440940605	667186841	I Am the Cheese	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Somewhat Overstated as a Great Work	I think the end of this book makes the entire story come crashing down around you. You, as a reader, are among a story that needs some sort of ending to tie it all together. As I read, I thought I could see where it was going in a general sense. But not specifically. When the end finally came, you saw it coming. You knew it had to be something like this.<br />But then there was a new end. It was the end that really tied the first end together with another aspect of it. Because as I read, I asked myself how the bike ride was going to tie in with the Q&amp;A sessions. We knew &quot;they&quot; were going to win and we knew that Adam was going to end up where he was because of who he was doing the Q&amp;A with. But we could not see the bike ride coming. <br />And to that end, I thought it was an interesting and enlightening plot twist where Adam ends his ride and encounters all the people we saw on the ride. Nice touch. Similarly, nice touch on the name of the book as well.<br />However, there is a real downside to this book. Part of me is disturbed because there is no Amy in the &quot;now&quot;. I realize that this is my Hollywood need for a better string of tie-ins that make me need to have it all fit together. But there was something just a bit more than sad about her lack of presence in this narrative's reality.<br />As a side note, how did he really know that the hotel had been abandoned? The thought just struck me. I think that's a flaw. <br />But too this strikes me as a bad book for a Young Adult audience. What are we supposed to see here? I don't think I ever identified (I'm not a young adult anymore) with the paranoia Adam felt at various points of the book. I mean, the Mr. Grey situation overstates some of the feelings we have as teenages growing up. It's overdramatic if you see this as an effort to parallel the crazy stuff that goes on in a kid's head.<br />Also, I did not like the real conclusion of the book. That he is just a number and the great big conspiracy engine trudges on. We suddenly go from an introspective young adult book trying to cope with the fears of a teenager to the omniscient governement agencies and why they cannot be trusted and that we're among a society where bad is inherent.<br />Really, what makes me question this book most is that of, What is the point? What are we supposed to learn from this book? What actions do we take as a result of gaining insight after having read it? If this is supposed to be nothing more than a relational narrative for young adults, why the overly sinister ending?<br />Also, I tend to disagree that Adam has this smashing discovery at the end because we merely find out that he is wrapped in a discovery cycle that never ends and merely makes Adam's fears and situations ever more unreal and less believeable than I originally thought when I encountered them.<br />In researching some analysis on this book (I had to see if I was way off the mark with my thoughts), someone says there is, &quot;No glimmer of hope for him.&quot; I agree. It's a sad narrative. I've also come across the notion that the book is a narrative on the individual against the system. But where? Where does this become evident? In fact, nothing that happens in the action suggest that there is anything individual happening and that the system has them all wrapped up and they accept it with little question. With the exception of his mother, there is no struggle of the individual against the system and that's not against the system, that's a struggle against Fear.<br />I think, in all, the book did rope me in to wanting to know how it was all going to tie together and ultimately the author's conclusion was weak. There are elements in it that are good and the writing is fine. But I think you need to look at the greater impact of the book and ask what it's trying to do.	2001-10-19
US	52559350	R1HIDTFBIWGE8Z	0553375407	350438534	Ishmael:A Novel	Books	3	3	5	N	N	It'll make you think if you have not thought this way before	The title of this review really says it all, but I will elucidate, since in reality it probably does not really say it all. I was unsure if I should give this book 3 or 4 stars. On one hand, it made me think a lot. On the other hand, the &quot;plot&quot; was not there. In fact, the attempts at making a plot are a waste of pages IMO. They should be cut out entirely.<br />The book is not a story but, as someone else mentions, a collection of Socratic dialogues given...well, I'll let you see what animal delivers the words. It's an interesting way to non-humanize the obviously human thoughts. Why do I say &quot;obviously&quot;? Well, I think Quinn is a human, that's all.<br />That doesn't detract from the book, which gives you a good bunch of arguments on why man is man and why man is doing what he is doing &quot;to&quot; the world as opposed to &quot;in&quot; it. The thought process makes you think. And thinking, regardless of if you agree with the book, is a successful thing to have happen in your life.<br />There are 2 things that I don't like, however. The book doesn't really give credence to any opposing viewpoints. Such as what if man really is a culminatin of Mother Nature's processes. There are other trains of thought that need to be discussed to make the thinking process more complete, I believe. But again, the fact that it made me think is a good thing.<br />The second thought I had is that anyone with significant philosophical and/or anthropological experience would read this book and say, &quot;Yeah, been there, done that.&quot; In some ways, it seems like a rudimentary level text on self-exploration and the introspection of the human race. But that does not necessarily make it bad. Just basic material.<br />I think this is a book everyone should read. It's a nice way to get yourself out of the NBC-based &quot;need for TV&quot; mold that so many people find themselves in. On the other hand, I'm not running out telling people all that we're doing wrong, as the book suggests I should do.	2001-10-18

I bought it on a recommendation from someone I know via the Internet. Not only did this book easily live up to its billing, it far surpassed anything I could have expected. It took me a few days to gobble this thing up, much to my wife's dismay.<br />The story, as we all know, is about the CNN-reported fire fight in Mogadishu, Somalia. The one where several dead men of the US military were dragged through the streets. That's all I remembered about the incident from 1993. When I piced up this book, I learned much, much more.<br />Bowden spared no expense in writing this book. If I didn't know any better, I would have guessed that not only was here there, but he had 5-6 clones of himself running around the Mog taking notes. He interviewed Delta Force team members and Rangers as well as Somalians and even wives of some of the guys lost in battle to piece his story together. When he finished, the story was an exquisite puzzle of what happened that day, or rather, days.<br />This is a great perspective on what happened and it also explores what went wrong and why the foreign policies of the US sometimes don't take everything into account when action is being made. A great dichotomy of roles is exhibited where the UN feeds people and then the US forces, in an effort to take down a certain clan, angers a large majority of the people there who see the US trying to crush an entity that has been with the people for generations and generations.<br />It's a futile policy conversely executed by a thoroughly copetent bunch of men who actually did the fighting. And it is told through the eyes and words of a very good writer. <br />Highly recommended.	2001-09-27
US	52559350	R12YRBKC4OLD36	0671742760	305457714	Dragon	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Standard Cussler, but not great	&quot;This book panders to the anti-Japanese sentiment of the early nineties,&quot; is one quote I read in a review above. Yup, this is the case. Without having actually read Rising Sun by Michael Crichton (saw the movie), it appears Cussler got caught up in the &quot;Japs are out to get us&quot; mentality that permeated the late 80's and early 90's. <br />But that's a premise and anyone who is familiar with a Cussler book knows that there needs to be an entity of evil associated with that which opposes Dirk Pitt (like every single movie made in the 80's where the Russians were the bad guys). In this case, it's the big bad Japanese financial and power machine image of that stated time period.<br />This is standard Cussler, as I said. But there are some stretches in &quot;reality&quot; that make you wonder just how much you are willing to believe when you read these books. Like I said, standard Cussler.<br />Having said that, this is a fine book. Escapism is another word someone used in describing this book. Well, sure. That's what this is all about. We're not talking the Bhagavad Gita here, people. This is good, clean (well, close) American fun. It'll make you cheer for the good guys and jeer the bad guys when they get theirs, which they always do.<br />I liked it. Cussler books are an easy escape from those books that make me think. And we all need that from time to time. The ties, albeit almost always far-fetched and quite Scooby Doo like, are fun. <br />In all, a good solid Cussler read.	2001-06-27
US	52559350	R2GHIMDL9HBKLF	0553277405	280332330	Night Probe!	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Damn fine novel	I'm not going to give this one 5 stars because it's just not as good as many people play it out to be. I had read a lot of these reviews before I bought it and it just wasn't one of the best books ever. Hey, Cussler is a good writer. I like his stuff. He's a great guilty pleasure author.<br />I liked Night Probe and will continue to read his stuff. All the same Dirk Pitt acrobatics are there. Giordino is in tow as well. Good stuff. Fun stuff. As can be expected.<br />On the down side, I thought some of the literary elements were a bit lacking. Not to give too much away, but I was not impressed with the explanation of the ghost train. Not at all. However. I did like the way the train was found. That was good, heady, stuff. <br />I did not really like the Foss Gly character. There was a bit of a contradiction there, I thought. He was awfully smart and got away with an awful lot. That's fine. Except it does not fit in with the final bit we see of him.<br />Finally, I thought Shaw's role in the book was a bit abrupt in the fact that it seemed more words had been written about him but were sliced out by the publisher. I guess I would have to know Cussler to say.<br />I liked the book. I'm trying to give a fair and even-handed review of it though. Definately recommended.	2001-05-17
US	52559350	R3RO5KGUX6B5ES	0871567466	905003758	Magnetic North: A Trek Across Canada	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Very riveting	A great book. It wasn't long enough is the only complaint, and that's if you force me to complain.<br />This is a great yet tragic story about a man/boy who was meant to be in the woods. The book is, as you can guess, a trek across Canada by foot, canoe, and dogsled. Those that like the outdoors and wonder what the world was like before cell phones, pavement, and the flood of civilization need to go no futher than this work. The beauty is that this trek happened in the late 70s.<br />This book, from cover to cover, makes you yearn to be out in the wild and to wish you were there, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel (well some of it. The near dying stuff is best left alone). The wilds of Canada call to you as you turn each page, realizing that these travels are really not that far removed from the US/Canada border. <br />One gets a great perspective in reading this book through the words of Halsey and with the notes of Diana Landau, who does a marvellous job walking us through the rough parts of the story that were not completed before David's death. In fact, it could be argued that the reader gets a more complete picture in this, essentially a 2 author affair, than if only Halsey would have done it.<br />Truly Halsey is a man who was born to be in the outdoors and it is a shame that he did not remain in one of the nooks or crannies that he had crossed on the way. While there was a sense of inexperience in both travellers, it's hard to not feel for them and see their learning as the trip wound on.<br />The book is out of print, so it will be hard to come by. But if you can find it, do so.	2001-05-01
US	52559350	R19OJ4CZ9VONCO	0525945636	356134546	Code to Zero	Books	1	1	2	N	N	This was just bad	This was my first Follet novel and likely my last. This was just bad. That's the best way to describe it. The character interactions were strained. The mood and nuance of the book took very small and unsure steps. But mostly, there was zero creativity in getting from one situation to another.<br />My problem there is that Anthony, the main protagonist, pretty much gets everything he needs to happen. If he were to suddenly need a can of Coke, you can bet that there would be one, on ice, wherever he was standing.<br />I'm not going to go into the factual erros that others have explored other than to say they were there.<br />Finally, the book just wouldn't end. It was as if the author needed to say, &quot;Oh...and,&quot; over and over again. The lesser protagonist, who I will not mention by name, and the way that character left the book was just sophomoric to say the least.	2001-04-12

This work is very good. But it is certainly not great. I find it hard to believe that Ambrose does not point out more often that Lewis was a blatant male chauvinist and when he does, he brushes it off as if it is an acceptible fact. That Lewis made no mention of the fact that Sacagawea's friend was in tribe that they met and her brother was the leader speaks volumes about how clueless Lewis was to the reality that surrounded them at times. But Lewis's penchant for being a bilnd idiot clouds his commentary and forever mars the history as viewed by the 20th and 21st century reader.<br />Ambrose is obviously taken in by the Lewis and Clark travells, which I freely admit are amazing stories. Ambrose, however, takes it to a new level and fashions a super-hero out of Lewis, who, quite frankly, acts a bit of a boob at times.<br />Look at the facts of the matter concerning Lewis. He was simply put a national hero. Yet he was unable to procure a wife after his adventure? His excessive drinking and brazen attitude were sure turnoffs to any woman he would have courted. Ambrose ignores this, mentioning only the alcohlism in passing and essentially shrugging it off.<br />Lewis was a bold and great adventurer. He was also a poor ambassador of the white man to the red man. Likewise, his chauvinistic views towards women make it very hard for me to look at Lewis and see this hero that Ambrose portrays.	2001-04-09
US	52559350	R12LUBZ59I28FB	0812513711	820960971	The Dragon Reborn (The Wheel of Time, Book 3)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Good, But Clearly Falling Off the Mark of the Previous Two	The book is good, but at times hard to get through. The last 100 pages wraps it all together - something that you certainly knew was coming but something you want to happen. Thus the book plods along top that course and in all honesty, it was not really a thrilling ending. Of the 675 pages or so, the final fight was maybe 3-4 pages long and it was essentially the same ending as the first 2.<br />Another failing of this book was that the action shifted around way too much. There were 4 different story lines going on in this one and Jordan takes the narrative from one party to the next too often in this text. In this vein, the narrative was too often away from Rand, which makes you lose interest.<br />Similarly, he goes to the expression about Nynaeve pulling at her braids far too often and characterizes the 3 young Aes Sedai to be as little more than trifling school girls at times and having virtually no sense among them. Then the next moment they are brilliant. A nearly impossible dichotomy there.<br />Sometimes this book is very fun to coast along and at other times you read the same exact expression, word for word, every single page. If I read, &quot;Burn me&quot; one more time, I'm going to wretch.<br />Jordan needs to cut out the aimless narrative when it is not warranted and get to more action (something he likely does not do in the 4th book as it is 20 pages short of 1000). Action is what keeps people up 2-3 hours past their bedtimes reading. This book simply did not do that. The plot was predictable overall, and little of new value was brought to the series in this book.<br />I like the series, however, and am now hooked. I will give book 4 a try and hopefully this was a bit of a bump in the road of a great series.	2001-02-19

I have to say I loved the book...a lot. Before this book, I had absolutely no knowledge of this history and now I find myself starving for more.<br />The reason, however, that I cannot give this 5 stars is because of the other reviews I read here. After viewing some of them, I begin to realize that Ambrose does indeed contradict himself in various points when he says things such as, &quot;The Sioux generally had no leadership and thus was the doom of the culture as the future would show us.&quot; He then turns around and says something to the effect that, &quot;Crazy Horse led his troops amazingly well in outflanking Custer...&quot;<br />You see the problem here. Ambrose does indicate enough that this was out of the ordinary for the Sioux in general. But to say that it happened only one day out of the hundreds of years of this culture's existence is certainly, as one other reviewer has mentioned, a romantic view.<br />After reading someone say that Ambrose's book is a romantic view of the situation, I would tend to agree in part to that. But then again, Ambrose goes through great pains to not make this a biased and unfair recollection of the times and lives of these two very interesting men. He does also tell us when he is guessing. I think Ambrose is fair, knows his limits, and does a great job retelling the story that he obviously painstakingly researches.<br />Those are my complaints about the book. On the other hand, I could not put this down. I found the book, from cover to cover, riveting and if anyone is looking for an introduction to the subject matter, this is definately the book to get. I have already ordered more material on this.<br />I will say again that this is my first book read on the matter. In time, I may come to think of this as trash or one of the best books ever written about the subject. I cannot say. So take this review for what it is. <br />One reviewer who gave this book 2 stars (who, by the way, was the reader who made me think twice about giving this a high and mighty rating) said that this is a good book for beginners...only if it makes you go on to read better and more accurate stuff. That is exactly what it has done for me.	2001-02-17
