Ok, cutting to the chase:  yes it's worth it, and no, he's not losing his touch -- but like anyone else with a working brain, the particulars will change over time.<br />David Sedaris is still the intelligent person's acid humorist, but he is growing to be able to play in two keys at once.  The sharp-tongued &quot;what was she thinking??&quot; materialist, and the thoughtful guy who understands the source of his inspiration (mainly family), and honestly gets what they were thinking after all.  And get this!  Admits it!<br />If you read The New Yorker and Esquire and some other Lit mags you may have seen much of this material before (hey, a guy's gotta eat between hardcover releases) but much is gained in the compilation.  Seriously.  I swear you will still suppress an evil snort at regular intervals!	2004-06-18

When starting this hobby, there are an immense number of guides and (often expensive) resources to choose from.<br />This book should be the first one you buy (well, if you are in the eastern half of the US).<br />But it should not be the last. The Peterson Guide uses drawings (important -- NOT photos) to show you the typical features of the birds around you.  Other great guides -- like the Audubon series -- use photos, but photos are harder for a beginner to use for a sure-fire identification. Or this beginner anyway...<br />No bird in the field looks exactly like the lovely Peterson drawing, but no two bird photos are ever alike, either (even of the same bird). Use the Peterson to get to know the bird species around you, and maybe next buy a guide like the Audubon Society Field Guide (just because -- I dunno, they seem like a one-two punch to me)! It's great to go looking with both, but if I had to choose one, it would be Peterson.<br />To learn more about birding in general, Sibley has a nice, shortish overview book called &quot;Sibley's Birding Basics.&quot;<br />I'm only getting started, but this is some advice about what's helped in beginning to learn all this wonderful stuff about the living world all 'round.	2004-06-13

This book manages, and it enthralled me -- the 40 year old aunt -- too.<br />Sharing books with the kids in our family has always been a great thing -- for their brains but also for our relationship. Teens are much much harder to connect with, however. <br />Tithe is a book that can help.  It's is not for the faint of heart -- a young adult book that opens with a murder attempt in a bar and includes underage drinking, sexual topics, and shoplifting -- and the seamier side of life. But the book is **really about** becoming who you are -- even taking advantage of universal fantasies like \\"I'm really a kidnapped princess!\\" to do so.  <br />The kids in this book do things that your teen will do or know others are doing, thinks in dreams and fantasies like all young people (and most adults) do, and has a heroine who uses her better self to get by and grow up -- without seeming too good to be true, or too nauseatingly sweet to swallow.  <br />Parents should see this book before they give it to their kids, and might need to be sure the child is old enough to handle it, but this is an honest and enthralling book that is sure to give food for thought and conversation.	2004-06-13

As a beginning birder but a more experienced traveller, however, I can tell you that this is a fabulous resource to have along, even if you are just generally curious about nature in the places you visit.<br />This guide covered EVERY region in a recent cruise from the most western to the most eastern points on the Mediterranean, inlcuding many islands.  It was terrifically easy to figure out which birds were likely candidates for each sighting -- and each time of year.  <br />Getting to know an area is more than having a favorite restaurant and knowing how to get from one point to the next.  Recognizing the creatures around, and maybe even getting to know their songs, will bring you even further into a new place.  This book is exhaustive yet accessible, and will really help you &quot;get there.&quot;	2004-06-13

This book has helped me avoid extreme errors on both ends of the spectum -- seduction by a beautiful but impossible (and expensive) plant, and overlooking a humble-on-the-shelf but PERFECT in the garden new addition.  <br />In order to be portable, the book HAS to leave some stuff out, and that can be annoying in today's world of endless varieties and hybrids.  There's an intro section on garden planning (and a good zone map), but the meat of this thing is the plant listings.  Go for it -- this is a good one.	2004-06-10

The book is full of internal connections, which you can take or leave without ruining the read.  Two weeks after finishing, I remember &quot;getting&quot; certain passages, and yet they were special (not cute) because they were not contrived like scenes in a blockbuster.<br />If you like this book, you might enjoy &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; or vice versa.	2004-06-10

It's respectful, compassionate, and unforgettable.<BR>This book is *not* about a disease. The main character never refers to himself as autistic, though his differences from other folks, and the obstacles he faces, are present in every aspect of his story. Christopher is not beleaguered by who he is -- he is busy being that person. Christopher wants  to understand what is going on, and has his own goals.  Go Christopher!<BR>Haddon, as author,  has placed himself, with love and respect, completely in the shoes of his main character, and we get to &quot;be&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; him in a way that I do not remember with any other character. <BR>If you like this book, you might enjoy &quot;Life of Pi,&quot; as well.	2004-06-10

Did you know that when Bin Laden sheltered in a cave, to Muslims he looked like he was emulating the Prophet, while in the West it was portrayed as &quot;going to ground?&quot;<BR>This is not the most profound and important of Hotaling's insights, but it is one of many that illustrate the misunderstandings between our civilizations, and how they can be most cynically manipulated on both sides.<BR>Hotalin's chapters of &quot;Islam for Beginners&quot; lay the groundwork for the critique of political approaches on both sides that ends the book. And it is a little frightening to put this volume down, and realize how little we understand each other.	2004-06-10

By the time the book was finished she had covered -- almost effortlessly -- a world where weather, textiles, religion, migration, agriculture, geography, mysticism, and so many other fields somehow come together.<br />These events happen in exotic, unfamiliar and inaccessible places but they are surprisingly relevant to our own lives. So many of the side lessons -- like a bad weather year in east Asia could cause a wave of invasions as far as Moscow, and did for millenia -- have helped to make the conflict-prone post-9/11 days a bit more understandable, sadly.  <br />It's hard to believe that her short lessons about things like dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) and paleolinguistics (word origins and the people who used them) could  turn into almost every day concepts, but it's true!  Imagine -- we can what the weather was in the Swedish summer of 863 B.C.E. because of tree trunks from around the world! It's a mark of mastery to take a subject so large and present it clearly, and Ms. Barber has done so.	2003-08-20

We see brutality so frequently, but \\"The Lovely Bones\\" goes there with insight and, eventually, wisdom.  The narrator is believable and moving without appealing to any kind of sentimentality.<br />This was an odd kind of page-turner.

It's not clear who the baddies are, or who the allies might be. And there is a Very Good Dog, for those of us who like canine character development.<br />It would help to have read some of the preceeding books in the series, as heavy mention is made of earlier adventures, but this one can stand on its own. Most characters beside Irene are of the cardboard-cutout school, but with all the action in motion, who has time for character development?

Clarity and emotional impact often trade-off, though, and the only reason I dock the author a half-star is that a bit too much feeling was left out of this portrait.	2001-10-02

I first read this book over 20 years ago, and returned to the commemorative edition as an exercise in nostalgia and to revisit history as it is written, remembered, and transmitted. The gist of this review is simple: we make into saints those people into whose stories we can inject our own preferences, dreams, and agendas... and we callously portray those who are more difficult to understand. Even so,  the result can be lyrical, touching, and even valuable, if understood for what it really is -- a hagiography.<br />This book deserves 4 stars because it gives thinking people a chance to take a peek at how an anti-colonial American missionary would evaluate the role of a British Colonial expat in a culture which threatened and resisted them both -- gracefully. Even while trying with the best of motives to tell the truth, it is difficult for an author to hide her baggage when describing a world to which she can never belong.<br />When Mrs. Landon writes Anna's &quot;innermost thoughts,&quot; for example, the latter include anti-colonial rhetoric that is a standard theme of  American internationalism, but a passing rarity among British expats!  These thoughts also model some of the missionary fervor of Landon's own Thai agenda.<br />No author ever lets us see the world as it is -- just their best perception.  Here we have the odd experience of peering at the unfamilar via the eyes of a foreigner who is guessing (poetically) at the views of a stranger.	2001-01-22
