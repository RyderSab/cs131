It's not only a story of a Father and his son traveling from one state to  another. Its about the  difference between &quot;static quality&quot; and  &quot;dynamic quality.&quot; One may imagine learning about the better  questions. It's not a book about motorcycle maintenance per say. It's about  the history of philosophy and an inquiry into values. What is Quality?  What is Philosophy? This is truly the great american novel. No big  explosions or human killings, but a culture bearing book about the dynamic  quality of life. I had an interesting experience with the author, 9 years  ago.  I sent him my graduate psychology paper on &quot;Personality  Psychology.&quot; He read inked most of my letters and my paper then sent  it back to me.  He said do a zen sesshin, and that my work was unfocused.  I read his book around 5 times to try to find the meaning of what he said.  Since then I'm just beginning to understand the difference between  &quot;classic quality or static quality&quot; and &quot;dynamic  quality.&quot; This book will help you think upon things deeply. It's not  for weary, it's for those who want to challenge themselves and their life  with new philosophy and new paradigms.	1999-02-12

It's a nicely generated possibly factual story about his beautiful conversations where he asks his guests at this $3,500/night vacation villa about how to become totally successful, and truly wealthy. I liked one of the interesting premises is that once you have<br />love it would power you to create money and wealth! He splits the book into 2 parts:<br />Heaven, and then Earth. I'm reminded very much<br />of the oriental philosophy i.e. Lao Tzu<br />Heaven Earth Wind Fire, etc.<br />Heres a nice quotation from the book, Unconditional Money:<br />&quot;Life doesn't pay much attention to methods,<br />it just flows through whichever channel's easiest. To life we're all the same like fingers on a single hand. If you were reaching to pick something up, and one hand was full, you'd use the other without even thinking. It's that way with life; if one of us is busy or pre-occupied, the energy will omve in through a stranger, a distant relative, or even an insurance agency. Life's not prejudiced or partial.<br />The instant we step out of ego, we are welcome to experience the constant flow.&quot;<br />-DAVID CATES<br /><br />A nice, heartwarming book.<br />Nice touches with a true story for the reader<br />who can dream again.<br />I like the style of writing.<br />Unique and exotic concepts.<br />David, if you're reading this please send me<br />your newest book!LOL<br />One may imagine learning about unconditional unlimited love<br />and money with this one!	1999-01-19
