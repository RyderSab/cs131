A witty polemicist, Coulter is enjoyable to read, but I would take much of what she says with a grain of salt. She is incapable of admitting that any liberal might be right on any issue, for any reason. Another weakness of the book is that many of the columns are from the Clinton years and are fairly irrelevant today. I still enjoyed reading it for all its flaws, nevertheless.	2005-10-06

James writes profound essays on all aspects of baseball. He cuts through the nonsense that ignorant journalists write and say about baseball. He proves he can write intelligently on baseball without throwing statistics at the reader.<br /><br />The book is basically four parts: reviews of the state of the baseball teams in the 1980s which is somewhat obsolete, critical comments on baseball players and managers, various essays on all aspects of baseball, and various studies discussing issues like the platooning advantage and the effect of stolen bases on team performance. Disdaining baseball \\"purists\\" , he offers controversial ideas, some of which he continues to put forth in his recent New Historical Baseball Abstract.<br /><br />Even though this was written almost 20 years ago, it is still relevant today. If you are a fan of good baseball writing, you should pick this up ASAP.	2005-09-18

Ultimately, 100 People  fails due to the author's extreme pro-Republican bias and his obsession with trivia. His bias shows right from the beginning. Early in the book, he takes on  celebrities like Jennifer Anniston and Julia Roberts, mocking them as would-be political scientists. Pro-Bush celebrities like Curt Schilling and Dennis Miller are, amazingly enough, not criticized for their incursions into the political realm. I guess it's OK to be famous and speak your mind, as long as you agree with Mr.Goldberg's views.<br /><br />Moving on to his list of 100 people who are screwing up America, he does make some good choices. The head of the Ford Foundation gets some well deserved criticism, as does Al Sharpton and a leading abortionist. The problem is that Goldberg too frequently focuses on the trivial. I'm no fan of Ludacris (or of rap in general), but is he really worthy of a spot in the list over Donald Rumsfeld, who colossally screwed up the war in Iraq? Jerry Springer, but not Tom Delay?  Goldberg also weakens his list by turning it into a personal vendetta. He includes his personal enemies, men such as Dan rather, Al Franken, and the president of CBS News. I'm sorry Goldberg doesn't like the way CBS News treated him, but that hardly makes Rather into someone who is \\"screwing up America.\\" As for Al Franken, he's the radio host at a network no one listens to, so I can't really justify putting him into this list. If Goldberg was fair, he would put Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh on his list, popular radio show hosts who blatantly distort the facts on behalf of an incompetent president (who should be #1 on this list, by the way).  Wait a minute, they can't be screwing up the country, they're Republicans!<br /><br />The ultimate proof of Goldberg's bias was in his vicious attack on Robert Byrd. He accuses Byrd of racism because he joined the Klan fifty years ago and (are you ready) voted against both Clarence Thomas and Thurgood Marshall!  Somehow, Jesse Helms and Trent Lott escape mention. He further blasts Byrd for bringing lots of pork to West Virginia. That's a legitimate point, but how about some criticism of Ted Stevens or Thad Cochran for their massive pork barreling? Oh, right, they're Republicans. Fairness and nonpartisanship are in short supply throughout this book. Save your money.and Thurgood Marshall!  Somehow, Jesse Helms and Trent Lott escape mention.

Of course, the memorable Pentagon Papers case that Abrams won is discussed in length.<br /><br />Abrams spares no one from criticism, including Wayne Newton and the sainted Rudy Giulani. However, the best part of the book was his discussion of the campaign finance reform lawsuit. Bitter over losing the case, not for himself but for the cause of freedom, he rips into the liberal judges who upheld the law. Their bias against him is clearly evident. That's another reason I admire him: his willingness to criticize the left as well as the right for suppressing free speech. The right does it in the name of \\"national security\\" and \\"morality\\"; the left does it in the name of \\"diversity\\" and \\"political correctness.\\" With freedom on attack from both sides of the political spectrum, the country needs champions of the Constitution like Floyd Abrams.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any reader concerned with the erosion of our freedoms.	2005-09-06

However, there are two undeniable facts about this book: 1. Halberstam makes many factual errors. 2. He does not understand baseball.<br /><br />Bill James, who has forgotten more about baseball than Halberstam ever knew, dissects and rips apart Summer of 1949 in his 1991 Baseball Book . There are many errors of fact that could have been avoided with a little research on Halberstam's part. To mention just a few:<br />1. Mel Parnell was not a rookie in 1948.<br />2. Gene Bearden did not win the Rookie of the Year award.<br />3. Jackie Robinson did not steal bases \\"at will\\" against Yogi  Berra in the 1947 series, in fact, he stole exactly one base.<br />4. Denny Galehouse was not primarily used in relief in 1948.<br />5. Joe McCarthy was not \\"weary of rookies.\\" In fact, very few managers used rookies as often as McCarthy did.<br /><br />James details other errors in his book, I won't mention them all here.  The bottom line is that halberstam is an extremely sloppy author. If he was a college student writing a term paper, he would get an F.<br /><br />Even apart from his factual errors, Halberstam betrays a lack of understanding of baseball.  For example, he states:<br /><br />Vern Stephens played an adequate shortstop, though in no sense was he one. Pesky (Johnny) was shortstop, but moved to third base because he had quick hands and feet.<br /><br />Put aside for a moment the fact that Connie Mack said Vern Stephens was the best shortstop in baseball. Mr. Halberstam, baseball managers do not, ever, move players from shortstop  because they have quick hands and feet. Players who have great hands  and feetare moved to shortstop, which is the most demanding defensive position. Obviously, the reason Joe McCarthy picked Stephens over Pesky as his shortstop is because Stephens was a better shortstop. (His fielding stats were excellent, not that Halberstam would know that, of course)<br /><br />I just hope Halberstam knows more about the other subjects he writes about, e.g.war and politics, than he does about baseball. Also, he really needs to get a fact checker/ research assistant before he writes any more books.ubjects he writes about, e.g.war and politics, than he does about baseball.

The problem is apparent early: Bozell is so far right-wing that even Fox News is not \\"conservative\\" to him.  Of course the media is \\"liberal\\" to someone like Bozell. Bozell picks quotes at random from journalists trying to prove his premise. This gotcha approach is less than convincing.<br /><br />What are the real facts? The right has Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Times, all of talk radio; yet they cannot stop whining about the \\"liberal media.\\" The press was far tougher on Gore then they were on Bush, despite Bozell's weak attempts to deny this fact. And Brent, if the media is liberal, why did they not question Bush's false claims of Iraq's WMDs?  A truly independent press would have probably stopped the war by exposing Bush's lies on Iraq. Furthermore, a truly liberal press would have torn apart the lies of the so-called Swift Boat Vets. The bottom line is that the media is simply not as liberal as Bozell would have you believe.<br /><br />The real problem with the media is simple. It is not that that the media is too liberal or for that matter conservative, it is that it is too reliant on the government sources for information,e.g. Judith Miller's reporting on Iraq's alleged WMD's in the New York Times. Bozell's book simply misses the mark.	2005-02-28

It was ultimately nothing more than a hatchet job on the Clintons and an early apology for a truly awful administration, that of George W. Bush's. Clinton can do nothing right of course; all of his successes are someone else's doing. His failures, on the other hand, are all his fault.<br /><br />Lowry never examines whether the Republicans' obessive efforts to bring Clinton down for a non-scandal that was blown way out of proportion possibly obstructed his ability to prosecute the pre 9-11 war on terror. Objective, rational discourse is not for Lowry. Every effort is made to make the Clintons look bad. To take just one example, Clinton is given no credit for the economic boom of the 1990s or his successful effort to cut the budget deficit. I'll guarantee that if the 1990s had gone badly, that too would have been Clinton's fault.  By no means do I think Clinton was perfect, but a good biographer attempts to assess his subject's successes as well as his failures.<br /><br />I'm just glad that I only got this at the library and didn't waste a cent purchasing it.	2005-02-21

This is a very enjoyable, well-written polemic on Abraham Lincoln, our deified sixteenth president.  DiLorenzo shows that Lincoln cared little about the freedom of the black race, and everything about consolidating power in the national government. Slavery was the pretense, not the cause of the \\"Civil War,\\" more accurately called the War of Northern Aggression (I am not a Southerner).<br /><br />As DiLorenzo points out, every other country in the world was able to abolish slavery without a bloody war. He further points out that the \\"Great Emancipator\\" cared very little for the freedom of Northern white men who opposed the war, jailing them by the thousands, suspending habeas corpus and shutting down newspapers. Lincoln acted  more like a dictator throughout the war than an elected president.<br /><br />The Real Lincoln ought to be required reading at our high schools and colleges.

He covers the deceptions of five different presidents, 3 Democrats and 2 Republicans. Part of the appeal of this book comes from its nonpartisanship; he is as tough on Johnson as he is on Reagan.  Throughout the book Alterman is consistent in his belief that American leaders owe the American people the truth at all times.  He has no patience for neo-Machiavellians who would pardon politicians for lying in the name of a greater cause, e.g. national security. Or, of course, for the peoples' \\"own good.\\"<br /><br />From Yalta to Gulf War II, Alterman shows the deleterious impact of presidential lying.

He takes on and demolishes some of the most pervasive myths in American history, from the \\"necessity\\" of dropping the atomic bombs on Japan to the common but mistaken belief that the First Amendment has protected free speech in America.  I highly recommend this book to all readers of American history, regardless of their political persuasion.<br /><br />Hardly an unqualified admirer of this country, Zinn pulls no punches in attacking America's dark past, from slavery and segregation of black people to the exploitation of workers in the early 1900s.  He is also a strong critic of American foreign policy. In what may be the most controversial part of the book, he attacks the common belief that war can be just.  Zinn shows that even in World War II much of the killing was unneccessary. Many conservatives will object to this, but I think Zinn makes a solid case for pacificism.  Just as controversial, Zinn believes free speech in America exists basically for the rich.  Class conflict is a recurring theme throughout Declarations of Independence.<br /><br />This was a terrific book and I look forward to reading A People's History of the United States.	2004-12-30

Karp's underlying premise is that polticians start wars to destroy internal reforms wanted by the people.  Here he shows how the Progressive movement was stymied by the Democrats and Republicans, with war as their chosen instrument.<br /><br />Part I is a history of the Spanish-American War and here Karp shows how both parties colluded to bring on an unnecessary war.  He firmly disagrees with the traditional historians who blame the war on the press.  Part II continues this analysis, applied this time to the years leading up to another unnecessary war, World War I.  Karp shows how Wilson drags the country into war, while all the time talking of peace.  Once again the motivation is the same: thwart reform at home.  Once the war has begun, Wilson uses the fake threat of German treachery to suppress the press and free speech of the American public.  The last chapter is particularly chilling, as Karp gives the example of a woman jailed for saying the government is for the profiteers.<br /><br />No political history has ever been done better. I am proud to give this book a 5 star rating and encourage anyone interested in history or politics to read this book.	2004-12-12

Written by the most left-wing member of Congress, Lying Down takes you on an exciting journey that was Ron Dellums' career.  Whether opposing Reagan's military buildup or denouncing apartheid and the Gulf War, Dellums stays true to his principles.<br /><br />As a political science junkie, I especially enjoyed the chapters on Dellums' congressional career.

I'm sure many people looking at this review have no idea who Dick Bennett was.  This is unfortunate, as Bennett was a terrific coach who did not get the publicity of, say, Bobby Knight or Dean Smith.  Ferris does a terrific  job of introducing the Dick Bennett to the reader. The book is somewhat similar to Feinstein's Season on the Brink,although not quite as good. (To be sure, the subject is a far more sympathetic figure).<br />Ferris, a coach himself, gives the reader a revealing look at Dick Bennett, not only as a basketball coach, but more importantly  as a husband, father, and mentor to his players. Bennett, while not as well known as Bobby Knight or Dean Smith, was one of the best coaches in the game. He would take a less than superb Wisconsin team  to the Final Four three years later.  In this book, he is portrayed as both an excellent coach and an outstanding, if flawed, human being.  Most readers will , as I did, come to the conclusion that Bennett is as good a person as Ferris portrays him.  Bennett is proof that a coach does not have to be a boor (e.g. Bobby Knight) to win at the Division I level.<br />The reader will also appreciate Ferris' inclusion of a glossary, as some of the terms used in the book were fairly technical and might not be understood by a casual basketball fan.  Basketball coaches, whether high school or college, will gain from studying Bennett's philosophy. My only complaint with Ferris is that he does not ask the Badger players how they feel about playing for Coach Bennett.  Without that perspective, I felt the portrayal of Dick Bennett was incomplete.  Nevertheless, I still recommend this book.<br />One sequel I'm sure many Badger fans  would love to read: the story of Bennett leading Wisconsin to their miraculous run to the Final Four in 2000.  Given the relative lack of talent on that team, the word miraculous is not an overstatement.ulous is not an overstatement.	2003-01-13

I think most of us already understand this concept. Not exactly the stuff controversy is made of. There were about four chapters of the book that were vintage Barkley.  He makes some good jabs at poltical correctness, although not nearly enough.  The chapter on John Drew was outstanding. He also takes up the issue of high school kids leaving too early; he says high school players should go to college to improve their game.  I'm not sure he's thought the issue through completely, though. It seems to me somone who grew up in poverty should understand that a poor kid in high school might need to get a NBA paycheck immediately to help their family, even if they miss out on a year or two of instruction in college.<br />However, a few good chapters aren't enough to justify buying this book. It's a disappointment. I hope Barkley will try again. I know he can do better.  Oh, and one more thing: Barkley's analysis of Bob Gibson just doesn't hold up. Bob Gibson wasn't mean because he grew up black in a white man's world.  Gibson was mean because he was mean.  Willie Mays was black, too, and grew up in poverty; yet he became a nice person. Things aren't quite as black and white as Barkley would have you believe.	2002-12-02

LaPierre and Baker do an outstanding job of defending the rights of gunowners in Shooting Straight.  The authors address and rebut most of the common gun-control arguments.  Their defense of the 2nd Amendment as being a personal right rather than a collective right was particularly convincing. Any fair-minded reader  will be forced to  concede that LaPierre and Baker have demolished a number of the myths of the gun control crowd.  Even if you're a gun control proponent, I urge to read this book with an open mind.  The NRA has been treated unfairly by the established media; I'm glad they decided to take their case to the public.<br />However, I do have one strong disagreement with the authors.  On page 52, they urge \\"the enforcement of the 20,000 gun control laws on the books.\\"  Wait a minute. The authors  devoted the rest of the book to showing us gun control laws don't reduce crime.  So why do we need to enforce thousands of laws that are ineffective as well as probably being unconstitutional? The authors don't explain this inconsistency. In my judgement, this weakness keeps the book from meriting a 5 star rating.  Nevertheless, it is still an excellent book that I can proudly recommend.	2002-11-05

The main premise of the book is that the Republican and Democratic party leaders collude to keep power, often by not contesting elections that could easily be won with any money or effort expended. A quick example from 25 years after the book's publication should suffice to verify Karp's thesis. In the state of Florida in 1998, half  of the congressional seats  were not even  contested (several other \\"contests\\" simply have write-in candidates with zero chance of winning). This was despite the fact that both parties knew winning an extra seat or two might well determine who controlled the next Congress.  Unfortunately, this fact is overlooked by not only the public, but all of the so-called experts on TV. Right now, the public perception still is that the parties fight like dogs to win elections at all possible costs. Karp sees what the pundits of today can't:  the goal of party leaders is to maintain control of their organizations,not to win elections. One quote from former Democratic speaker Sam Rayburn demonstrates this principle;when faced with a coming landslide for his party and a gain of many seats for his party,he ruefully says :\\"I'd just as soon not have that many Democrats, they'll be difficult to control.\\" This is the shocking but real story of how politics in America really works. A truly indispensable work.<br /><br />....	2002-09-20

It is an interesting read and has some very good points, but it also has obvious flaws. The problem with the book is, ironically, the same problem Coulter has with the mainstream media. Namely, the author is as biased and unobjective as the mainstream media she despises.<br /><br />Coulter certainly has a good argument when she blasts the media for leftist bias. Much of the media is biased toward the left. Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, and many others in the press have unfairly attacked conservatives. Many in the media have an axe to grind and certainly Coulter deserves credit for calling them out.<br /><br />So, why can I give the book only three stars? Simply, like many ideologues left or right,Coulter does not and perhaps cannot see the other side of the issue. Yes, CNN, the New York Times,and others are biased, but conservatives aren't exactly voiceless in the media today. Let's name a few: FOX News, Rush Limbaugh, the Washington Times, the Wall Street Journal editorial page,etc... Even liberal outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post have many conservative commentators- William Safire, Charles Krauthammer, etc...  I think it's safe to say that the Washington Post has far more conservative writers than the Washington Times has liberal writers. The obvious fact is that the media is far less monolithic than Coulter would have you believe.<br />Coulter is so determined to make the media into a left-wing demon that she makes the preposterous claim that William Safire and Bill O'Reilly are not conservatives. This may be the weakest part of the book. As for the argument that O'Reilly is not a conservative because she opposes the death penalty, I could with equal absurdity claim that Bill Clinton was a conservative because he supported the death penalty. Many leftists, as dogmatic as Coulter, argued in the 90s that Clinton was not a liberal. This was, of course, absurd- but no more so than Coulter's analysis of Safire and O'Reilly.<br /><br />Another big weakness of the book is Coulter's propensity to engage in ad hominem attacks. Yes, I know many liberals do it as well, but that doesn't make it right. The personal attacks add nothing to the substance of the book. The ad hominem attacks are especially out of place in a book that criticizes leftists for making personal attacks on conservatives (which they certainly do, too frequently).<br /><br />It's too bad the author is so biased. The book had some very good arguments and could have been a lot better.I'm still hoping someone will write an equally passionate book that has more objectivity and less name-calling. I'm afraid, though, the author of this book won't be Ann Coulter.

Most of the book consists of recycled,unoriginal conclusions. Yes, most knowledgable baseball fans know Babe Ruth didn't save baseball single-handedly and was a womanizer, Mantle was a better offensive player than Mays, Ted Williams was a better hitter than Joe Dimaggio, etc... As another reviewer pointed out, most of these ideas were originally proposed by Bill James years ago. I cannot recommend this book.<br /><br /> Furthermore and far worse, Barra makes several factual errors in Clearing the Bases. In his misguided attempt to tear Babe Babe Ruth down, he incorrectly states that Ruth benefited from good homerun parks in Boston and New York. This is absolutely false. One thing Barra didn't learn from Bill James: Fenway Park in 1919 was a very tough homerun park. Ruth hit 20 of his 29 homers on the road. For his career Ruth had more homers on the road. I sent the author an e-mail informing him of this fact, which he has not acknowledged. Another misstatement occurs in the Lefty Grove section. Barra says that Grove missed time in 1934 because Connie Mack was overusing him. That would have been unlikely, since Grove was traded to Boston before the season and wasn't being coached by Mack that year. Barra can do better and I hope he will try again. Don't waste your time and money on this book.	2002-08-25

Books	2	14	37	N	N	Poor, superficial analysis of  the Constitution	This book is hopelessly flawed, as it is based on some very weak assumptions. Dahl is a worshipper of democracy; he does not realize or does not appreciate the Founders' distrust of democracy. As former New York governor Horatio Seymour pointed out many years ago, the purpose of the  Constitution was to check democracy, not to promote it.  Since Dahl only values the Constitution as an instrument of democracy, which it clearly is not, he can see it only as a flawed, reactionary document written by slaveholders.<br />Defenders of the Constitution like myself do not, as Dahl and his approving reviewers seem to think, consider the Constitution as sacred.  The Constitution has been changed many times and will no doubtbe altered again in the future. It is a matter of defending the form of government the Founders wisely chose, that of a republic as opposed to a democracy. The rights of minorities, which Dahl treasures, are far more secure under a republican form of government than a mobocracy. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to realize this fact, which is regrettable.  For a political science professor at Yale he lacks a basic understanding of American political principles.	2002-08-09

James pulls no punches in ripping the Hall of Fame for some very poor selections. He introduces several new concepts such as the Black-Ink test. As a Cub fan, I appreciate his advocacy of Ron Santo's selection to the Hall. As good as the book was, though, I couldn't give it the 5 star rating. James spends way too much time debating Phil Rizzuto's merits; Rizzuto v. Reese, Rizzuto v. Stephens Rizzuto v.Jerry Priddy (?), etc.. Nonetheless it is a great book and well worth buying.

You can't. The book is very flawed. Hoban simply chooses to disregard park effects and league context, and you cannot correctly evaluate players without adjusting for context. To take one obvious example: Chuck Klein's 1930 season was not the seventh best offensive season in history. I seriously doubt it was one of the top 50 seasons. Klein compiled these statistics in the best offensive season in the century, and in the best hitter's park in baseball. He hit .443 with 26 HR's at home, and .329 with 14 HR's on the road. Mickey Mantle's 1956 season, which did not make the top 25, was far better (to mention one of many possible examples).<br />It would be easy to keep pointing out more absurd statements the author makes, for instance: despite the HEQ score,Ellis Burks in 1996 did not have the 32nd best season of history; Coors Field grossly inflated his stats. One last point: of Hoban's top 20 offensive seasons, all but one was during the big hitting era of 1920-39. I would ask those readers who gave this book a good review: Is it really plausible that 95% of the greatest seasons in baseball history just happened to be in this era? This is simply not believable . This book is not worth the time of a serious fan of baseball. If you want a real analysis of baseball greatness, read Bill James' Historical Baseball Abstract.	2002-06-25

Since the flaws in it are too many to enumerate, I will confine myself to a few key points. I do not understand how so many other readers can give this book 5 stars. It falls short of his previous excellence. A few of my criticisms of the book are:<br /><br />1. In his (superior) first abstract, he makes it crystal clear that you can not combine peak and career value for baseball players and for every position has rankings divided accordingly. Here, he suddenly combines the two with no explanation whatsoever. Since he makes this such a crucial point in Book I, this change absolutely called for an explanation. If he changed his mind, fine, but let's hear why.<br /><br />2. Too much inconsistency. For instance, he ranks Roger Clemens ahead of Sandy Koufax in the 100 greatest Players of all-time section, but has Koufax ahead of Clemens in his ranking of the 100 greatest pitchers. Also, Mark McGwire was one of the greatest players of all time, but Cecil Fielder is just a \\"fat guy who hit home runs.\\" Right, we know what a great fielder and baserunner Big Mac was through his career.<br /><br />3. In his first volume, he ranks (correctly, in my view), Lefty Grove as the greatest pitcher of all time. He shrugs off Walter Johnson's advocates with the following point: dead-ball pitchers could pitch more innings because there were no home runs. Solid argument, Bill. So why did you put Johnson ahead this time? Shouldn't you at least explain why you were wrong the first time? The answer,I think, is his over-reliance on his career Win Shares statistic. Sometimes, you have to use common sense over pure stats. I didn't see that in this book.<br /><br />Maybe James spoiled me with the first historical baseball abstract. That was a truly terrific book. This one, to be sure, has some interesting and insightful points. It's not a bad book, and if you have a half hour to kill, why not browse it at your library or bookstore. It just isn't up to the high level of excellence that James demonstrated in his first book.f you have a half hour to kill, why not browse it at your library or bookstore.

This is the &quot;vice  versa&quot; pure libertarians never discuss. Nor is corporate abuse, such  as random drug testing for $7/hr jobs examined.

It is disingenuous for his  defenders to compare him with Howard Stern or Don Imus who are legitimate  entertainers, whatever one may think about their style.

Rush's defenders try to change the subject in their reviews,i.e., why  don't the authors talk about Bill Clinton's lies?  The reason is simple:  there are many other books from conservative sources that talk about  Clinton in very negative terms; there is no need for this particular book  to discuss Clinton.

Cohen and Solomon are scathing in their criticisms of the news media. They consider most journalists timekeepers for their corporate bosses, and a good deal of their analysis is correct. Unfortunately, being extremely liberal, they do not discuss the vice versa, media unfairness toward conservatives and conservative viewpoints; I don't know if this is an oversight or deliberate, but I would assume it's the latter. Still, this is well worth reading, so long as the reader takes it with a grain of salt.	1998-07-12

It has Adams' best comics, and I couldn't stop from laughing out loud in public reading some of the strips. Get it ASAP!	1998-06-28

It is a thrilling indictment of the elites in the news media and government, whom Karp accuses of betraying the American people. Karp is a great writer, but Liberty Under Siege, while worthwhile reading, is nowhere near the level of his other books such as the Politics of War and Buried Alive. Regrettably, I have to strongly criticize the book. Karp makes too many far-fetched and unsubstantiated claims in Liberty Under Siege.    Part I of the book is a review of the Carter administration and its struggles with Congress. Karp's theory is that elites in the Democratic Party, e.g. Tip O'Neill and Scoop Jackson, deliberately destroyed Carter's presidency to keep control of the party from the people. I don't think Karp backs up this very controversial theory with enough evidence. Part II is a harsh indictment of the Reagan administration and of the Democratic party leaders. Karp accuses them of colluding against the American people. Again, he does not make a convincing case for this theory.    In fairness to Karp, he does make some valid and important points. He rightly blasts Congressional leaders of both parties for undermining campaign finance laws and allowing money to subvert the political process. He also rightly blasts Reagan for his poor record on civil liberties, especially his undermining of the Freedom of Information Act. If Karp had simply confined himself to dispassionate criticism of the political establishment, his book would have been much more effective. The conspiracy theories will unfortunately obscure his legitimate points.	1998-06-28
