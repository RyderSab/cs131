Spurgeon Autobiography: The Early Years, 1834-1859	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Excellent Christian Biography	Spurgeon was called \\"The Prince of Preachers\\" for his fantastic oratorical skill and his incredible fidelity to the gospel-both of these elements come through vividly in this autobiography.  Spurgeon's gift for words is evident, as he writes extremely well; and his obvious passion for gospel preaching and the glory of God is challenging and inspiring.

The church is central to God's plan to evangelize the world and build his people up in the faith--after all, it is called the body of Christ, the bride of Christ, and the temple of God!  But somehow American Christians have come to think that the church is optional or even irrelevant to their Christian lives.  Joshua Harris has written this book to show that we are social animals, saved by God to live our Christian lives in the context of a local church.  Not only is this essential for our own spiritual well-being, it is the primary way in which we are called to minister to other believers, and to evangelize unbelievers.	2004-10-22

Peterson is particularly good when he discusses the meanings of the different Hebrew and Greek words that we translate \\"worship\\", and when he talks about how Christ fulfills the sacrificial/temple worship of the Old Covenant.  This is simply a really solid, thoughtful, and biblical theology, written from an evangelical point of view.  It is the standard biblical theology of worship, and rightfully so. <br /> <br />Peterson also talks about corporate worship (namely church services), emphasizing that the New Testament seems to suggest that gatherings of Christians are for edification more than worship.  His argument is that worship is what we should be doing all of the time, so it doesn't make sense to talk about gathering for that express purpose.  I think he fails to emphasize the special quality that God, in his providence, has ordained for corporate worship. <br /> <br />Regardless, this is an excellent, supremely biblical book, and comes recommended by scholars as eminent as D.A. Carson, Mark Dever, and I. Howard Marshall.  It is scholarly, but pretty accessible, and well-written. <br /> <br />	2004-09-30

There is certainly some wisdom in this book.  I first read Celebration of Discipline a number of years ago and was challenged in every facet of my spiritual walk.  The spiritual disciplines are too often ignored in the church today, and Foster is right in reemphasizing them.<br />Still, I have some serious reservations about this book.  There are several places in which he seems to argue for open theism (or something that very much resembles open theism).  In short, this is the proposition that God doesn't know the future, and that He can change his mind in response to the prayers and petitions of human beings.  This might seem very pious, but it is clearly unscriptural.  See, for example, Numbers 23:19:  &quot;God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?&quot;; Malachi 3:6 &quot;For I, the Lord, do not change&quot;;  or Psalm 139:16 where David says to God &quot;All the days ordained for me<br />were written in your book before one of them came to be.'  Open theism is inconsistent with the Scripture, and traditional Christian theology.<br />If you choose to read and use Foster's book, do it with discernment.  There is some helpful advice, but also some false teaching.	2004-04-29

I'm not a scholar of the Biblical languages (yet), so I can't comment on the technical issues that some people have raised; still, it is pretty clear to me that they managed to stay very close to the original text.  The accuracy is up there with the NASB, but this bible is far more readable and stylistically elegant (a modern entrant into the RSV/KJV family).  <br />The layout of this particular Bible is also excellent.  The footnoting system is clear and unobtrusive; the center-column reference system easy to use and, again, unobtrusive.  I also like that each individual verse is arranged in paragraph form; the NASB I have has each verse beginning on the left margin, making for choppy reading.  Finally, the book introductions are short (about a paragraph) and informative.  They give you some historical context, some structural info about the text, and then send you on your way.  Physically, this is an elegant, attractive Bible and just the right size.<br />I have used the NIV for years, and this marks my transition.  I found that the translation is just different enough that I could read and not have every word sound familiar.  I know a lot of Bible teachers advice you to rotate translations so your reading will feel fresh.  This is a great translation to rotate to.  <br />What a joy it is that God has given us his Word to read and study!  I am thankful for this Bible.	2004-01-30

It is really faithful to the text, but easier to read and more stylistically elegant than the NASB.  I just made the transition to ESV from NIV.<br />Now, I have gone through the NIV One Year Bible probably three or four times.  It really is a worthwhile experience.  If you struggle with having a regular Bible study time, using the One Year will keep you on track.  Plus, it enables you to get through the whole Bible without bogging down; many people just start from Genesis and lose it somewhere in Leviticus.  Leviticus is important (all scripture is God-breathed) but perhaps not as immediately relevant to the Christian today.  This way you read it and something from the New Testament.<br />In short, I have to agree with the above reviewer.  This is a great Bible study system with a great translation.  If you are used to NIV (or some other translation) then the reading the ESV is a way to make the Word (and the Gospel) seem fresh and new.  Grace and Peace to all of you!	2004-01-30

Like virtually everything he wrote, this novel is engaging, emotional, and intensely human.  It follows a pattern that is bound to seem familiar to those acquainted with Dickens, and has a very Dickensian happy ending; but then, that is what we love about Dickens.  There is still something to be said for virtue, and it satisfies our sense of justice when it wins out in the end.  That isn't a very modern sentiment, but it is an undeniably good one.  This isn't the first book I would recommend for someone wanting to pick up a little Dickens (Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist would probably all come first), but this is worth the read.

Yann Martel (or the narrator) claims that this is a story to make you believe in God.  Wow.  That sets the bar pretty high.  The book begins with a story about a little boy that loves all religions with equal fervor.  But this theme is forgotten almost entirely.  Overal, the book feels disunified, as if Martel didn't have a clear idea about what he was trying to say or how he wished to say it.  The component parts don't necessarily work together.  On top of this, Martel's prose is occasionally quite clunky.  There were more than a couple of sentences that made me grimace.  Martel obviously has some talent but also needs to mature a lot as a writer.

However, I only gave it three stars because the presentation is at times very uneven.  Yann Martel is a promising writer but he too often settles for obvious observations.  He is not a great prose stylist either; his sentences are often awkward and stilted.  At times I found it difficult to focus on the story because Martel obviously didn't have control of the language.  The narrative structure he uses is also somewhat problematic.  Martel isn't able to consistently tell the story in his narrator's voice (like, say, Dickens) or let it fade into the background altogether.  The result is an narrator that hardly resembles the external character.  At times this book reminded me of Marquez , at times Melville, but it really didn't measure up to either.  I got very little sense of this book as a whole.  There really seemed to only be a couple different only coincidentally related stories.  That being said, this book is worth reading.  It has a lovely--if somewhat simplistic--ending and it can easily be read in a day.	2003-04-19

Shakespeare probably comes the closest. Eugene Onegin is a masterpiece and the genius of it's creator is apparent.  It is alwasy difficult, however, to read poetry in translation.  Others have spoken of the translation difficulties already.  As a non-Russian speaker, I won't comment on them except to say that, at some points, the difficulties encountered in translation are obvious and frustrating.  Professors have told me, however, that this translation is about as good as they come.  Like any other work of genius, Eugen Onegin needs a careful reading.  Each layer, and there are many, proves more rewarding then the next.  Pushkin is often funny, passionate and has a pretty keen sense of satire.  I would advise everybody to read this.

The first part of the book, which focuses on the historical dialogue between science and religion, is particularly good.  His treatment of modern scientific thought and some of the controversies therein is worthwhile, as well.  The author emphasizes the interrelatedness of science and religion and the respective ways in which they create knowledge.  It is pretty clear that Barbour writes from a liberal, pluralist Christian perspective.  Most of his examples and expertise seem to focus on the Christian tradition but he does talk about Buddhism a bit.  The position that is perhaps least represented is that of the conservative, Bible believer. This book is best read as a summary of various philosophies as Barbour's theology is flawed.	2002-04-26

It is hard to describe The Brothers K in so short a space.  Very simply put, there is a depth of spiritual and psychological analysis in this book that is unparalleled.

There is very little point in summarizing the plot because that wouldn't really convey much.
