She focuses on meals in the life and parables of Jesus, which in many ways tell more than the Last Supper story does about what our mission should be. <br /> <br />The chapter on meals covers 19 scripture passages including the wedding feast at Cana, dinner with the Pharisees and, of course, the feeding of the 5000. We see here an explicit reference to small-e eucharist as Winter points out that the emphasis is satisfying physical hunger. \\"That was a priority for Jesus. It is a priority now.\\" <br /> <br />Her reflection on the parable of the wise and foolish wedding attendants (Mt 25:1-12) is a good example of applying unconventional wisdom to an old story. The traditional interpretation, that storing up good works gains the approval of the heavenly gatekeeper, whom we assume to be Jesus, is problematic for some. For starters, the wise may be seen as \\"eating and drinking and being merry while the poor are kept outside.\\" And Jesus would never have barred the door, writes Winter. She also suggests that the \\"foolish\\" attendants may have been sensible, hardworking, and resourceful. They did bring some oil, perhaps as much as they could afford, though not enough to see them through the delay. And they went out in the middle of the night and managed to return with lighted lamps; yet they were barred. She closes with the notion that it would be just like Jesus to have told the story in reverse.	2005-10-11

She calls on the works of scholars from the 13th to the 21st centuries including Francis of Assisi and his follower Bonaventure of Bagnoregio, Duns Scotus, Thomas Merton, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. <br /> <br />In the opening chapter Delio explains that Bonaventure viewed Christ less as a remedy for sin and more as the goal and center of the universe, and that the Incarnation is not about sin but about the love of God. She writes, \\"The fullness of the mystery of Christ is completed in humanity; thus it depends on us human beings and our participation in the mystery of Christ... God bends over in love for us through the Word Incarnate.\\" <br /> <br />Delio uses this image of God bending over us in love as she looks at three concerns: the place of God in an evolutionary universe, the role of God in a suffering world, and God's humility in a world of pluralism and difference. In discussing the importance of living in relation to Christ, Delio reminds us that for Francis, Christian life meant active engagement and attention to \\"the humility of God who hides in ordinary fragile human flesh, tiny creatures, and the natural elements of creation.\\" <br /> <br />Reflection questions at the end of each chapter help groups and individual readers to digest the material and bring it to bear on their own lives. An index and extensive bibliography are also included.	2005-10-04

In the opening chapter, she is described as a woman of customs and traditions, one who pushed the limits of kindness to include thoughtfulness, consideration, concern, gentleness, respectfulness, politeness, and more. In the final chapter, reflecting on Nonna's death from cancer at age 58, Iezzi proclaims her to be one of the most important people in his life. A composition he wrote at that time called her \\"the best grandmother and the smartest storyteller in the whole world\\" who knew \\"everything in life and knew the stories of all the great people and saints that ever lived in the world.\\" The intervening chapters are filled with anecdotes involving a variety of events and individuals that provide insight into this family as well as an earlier culture.	2005-09-08

Walsh expresses concern not that this sacrament has undergone more changes than any other through the years, but that Catholics learn to approach it \\"integrally, meaningfully, and regularly.\\" He describes penance as a sacrament of healing, forgiveness, and reconciliation, and believes that  \\"penance should be the sacrament for contemporary society.\\" That established, Walsh lists and counters three common reasons people avoid confession: (1) feelings of embarrassment and shame, (2) confusion about the sacrament and its forms, and (3) the belief that \\"basically good persons\\" have no need to confess. In the chapter on getting back to frequent confession, Walsh explains the benefits of penance or \\"reconciliation\\" as the sacrament is now called: grace, ongoing conversion, keeping on track, and moral counsel and spiritual direction. He also addresses the mechanics of confession, particularly examination of conscience, and the role of the priest.<br /><br />Walsh uses plain language and examples to help make his case, which should be of interest to the large percentage of Catholics who, for one reason or another, are not now or never were in the habit of receiving this healing sacrament regularly.	2005-09-08

Basil Pennington, a friend of Thomas Merton, has put together a brilliant introduction to the man known as one of the great modern spiritual writers. In the introduction, the editor expresses the wish that this anthology will be as \\"savory\\" to those new to Merton as it is to long-term fans. He accomplishes that goal by organizing excerpts from Merton's books, articles, journals, letters, and poems seamlessly and inserting himself only briefly, with short comments before each new topic. He has also added titles the excerpts and cited the original works and page numbers. As logic would dictate, the first section is taken wholly from Merton's best known work, \\"Seven Storey Mountain,\\" which ends as the recently baptized Merton moves toward joining the Trappists. <br /> <br />Other sections address Merton's journey into prayer, exploration of eastern religion, and advocacy for peace and justice. He writes that \\"stopping too soon is the commonest dead-end in prayer.\\" And of peace: \\"The only way truly to `overcome' an enemy is to help him become other than an enemy. This is the kind of wisdom we find in Gandhi. It is the wisdom of the Gospels.\\" Alongside these reflections, we occasionally glimpse Merton's lighter side, as when he suggests that lay persons who wish to practice contemplation might move to the country or take jobs that lend to solitude. The small town move, he admits, might involve poverty, and the solitary job, well, \\"Not everybody wants to spend his life as a night watchman, and for very good reasons.\\" He goes on to make some practical suggestions on contemplative prayer in secular life. <br /> <br />Pennington has given us a resource that demonstrates Merton's breadth and depth, his humor and his intelligence, and most of all, his great love for God.	2005-08-21

By age six, Charles was orphaned, and by the time he was 12, he and his grandfather were forced to flee their home under threat of invasion by the Germans. In those years Charles was greatly troubled. By age 15 he had lost all faith, partly because of the cultural climate of religious skepticism and emphasis on science as the highest truth. As a young man, Charles sought pleasure and adventure, spending a year in Morocco among the outcast Jews and Muslims. After coming home to France, he was more mature, but still searching. Eventually he rediscovered Catholicism and in 1890 joined a Trappist monastery. He was ordained a priest in 1901. <br /> <br />The Foucauld biography written by Annie of Jesus provides much detail on those early years, but focuses primarily on the story of his time among the Taureg, an Islamic people in the Sahara Desert. Several general observations come to the fore, in particular that Charles came back to Jesus understanding that the Lord had been waiting not to forgive him, that was a given, but to heal him. The pleasure-seeking activities in his early years left him lost and empty. Living in humility and poverty among the Taureg, working to overcome the injustice they suffered, preparing lexicons and translations of their language, were fulfilling. Though Charles's story was long ago and far away, it has the power to inspire people who experience loss and emptiness in our own culture.	2005-08-21

It is not surprising, then, that his purpose is to provide a true understanding of Catholic doctrine as found in council documents. And in keeping with this focus, Schreck uses format, style, and language inviting to those famous \\"people in the pews.\\"    The areas of major dissent are dealt with primarily in the fifty-some pages of the first section under the headings Vatican II the Crisis and the Critics; The Deeper Crisis in the Church Since the Council; and Setting the Record Straight. The remaining eleven chapters examine Vatican II teachings on topics including Scripture, worship, Christian unity, and the challenge to bishops, priests, and religious. Three chapters are devoted specifically to what we can learn from the council about the role of the Church and its members in the modern world. In each case, the author uses quotations from council documents and examples of ways we might apply the teachings.	2005-08-02

Books	4	17	18	N	N	The Art and Product of Scripture Study	This work is a compilation of papers delivered at a 2003 conference addressing Johannine theology and dedicated to Raymond E. Brown, S.S., an internationally respected New Testament scholar. On one level, this is a work by scholars for scholars; however, it also has much to offer those interested in learning more about scripture study and, in particular, the place of John's gospel in the New Testament. In Craig R. Koester's chapter on the death of Jesus, for example, we learn that the story of the crucifixion in John has traditionally been studied in combination with the other three gospels, but critical scholarship moves in the opposite direction, looking at the four stories independently. In that light, Koester explains, John stands alone, telling of Jesus' triumph while the Synoptics focus on his suffering. The remainder of the chapter looks at the crucifixion as described by John \\"as an expression of love in human terms, as a sacrifice for sin, as conflict with evil, and as a revelation of divine glory.\\"	2005-07-28

During his first five years as pope, John Paul II presented his reflections on the \\"theology of the body\\" in a series of weekly addresses. This series, later collected and published, is the focus of Healy's work, and it is not light reading.  <br /> <br />\\"The pope likes to begin with 'hard sayings' the words of Jesus that many find offensive because they seem too idealistic, too rigorous, and too severe,\\" Healy reports. A basic element of the pope's theology defines body and soul as a unit: we are not souls attached to bodies; we are body persons; the body is the visible expression of the person, the outward sign that reveals the inner person. In that arena, the possibility of viewing the body as an object for our own or another's pleasure vanishes. The creation story reveals the inherent complimentarity of men and women, different bodies within the same nature called to relationship that can produce another human being. John Paul emphasizes the positive implication of this view. Rather than leading to denial of freedom, the theology of the body impels us to voluntarily channel our freedom into the total gift of self to a chosen spouse, and through that person, to God. And these general reflections may be broadened to encompass all persons, regardless of their marital state. <br /> <br />Healy aids readers of this enlightening and informative work with chapter-by-chapter study tools consisting of scripture references, church teaching, key concepts, questions for reflection and discussion, and practical applications.	2005-07-27

Pable brings to this new work: \\"For two millennia the church has withstood wars, schisms, scandals, abuses of power, and controversy upon controversy. In that same time, it has given physical and spiritual healing to the sick, homes to the impoverished, courage to the frightened, understanding to the intolerant, and love to the hard-hearted. In a way, the church's history is much like the people, clergy and lay, in every parish in the world--an embodiment of good and evil, sin and holiness.\\"    On the way to that statement, Pable addresses the six reasons for staying in (or reconnecting with) the Catholic Church: community, tradition and history, sacraments, scripture, stewardship and mission, saints and sinners. In addressing scripture, tradition, and history, he reminds us that Jesus did not leave an operating manual, that early believers received word-of-mouth instruction on the set of beliefs passed down in the Christian community from generation to generation. Following the example of Jesus, the Church has always placed great emphasis on the teaching authority of the popes and bishops as interpreters of scripture and tradition.     Today's seekers, Pable believes, turn to the Church following their realization that \\"there needs to be some body of teaching that can claim continuity with the apostolic church\\" and an authority that can uphold and clarify that teaching through time.    This work fully acknowledges the problems of the Church, most recently clergy sexual misconduct, and offers useful insights for those falling anywhere on the scale between sticking it out and leaving. It is especially valuable to those involved in welcoming-back ministries and RCIA.	2005-07-18

Pronouncements to David regarding his sons in the Book of Samuel are matched to Luke's passages in which Gabriel foretells Jesus' greatness. Hannah's song from Samuel, which begins \\"My heart exalts in the Lord; my strength is exalted in the Lord...\\" is matched with Mary's response to Gabriel: \\"My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior...\\"    Comparisons such as these are a staple in Sri's work, but he also offers collateral insights, such as the discussion on Joseph's response to Mary's pregnancy. Three major theories are described. First, Joseph may have been being kind to Mary by not publicly accusing her of adultery, for which the punishment was death by stoning. Second, Joseph may have been aware that Mary had conceived in the Holy Spirit and thus humbly offered to release her from the obligation to be his wife. Third, Joseph may have been confused, knowing that Mary was pregnant but also believing in her innocence.      Sri, an assistant professor of theology at Benedictine College in Atchison, Ks., bases his commentary on contemporary biblical scholarship and insights from Catholic tradition. Reflection questions at the end of each chapter make this an especially valuable resource for small groups.	2005-07-18

As the introductory material explains, Romero was gunned down while celebrating Mass on March 24, 1980. His execution was clearly ordered by government forces, known for silencing anyone demanding an end to corruption and injustice. In just a few pages of introduction we learn a good bit about Romero's faith and courage, highlighted in the 365 excerpts that follow. Each meditation is accompanied only by a descriptive title and references for the readings on the day the homily was preached. And each provides much food for reflection. On Sunday Mass, for example, Romero said, \\"I have to dethrone all the idols that want to take God's place in my heart or in my people...the idols that separate men from God. Sunday has to be for us the alliance with the Lord that is renewed.\\" And of martyrs, he said, \\"It would be sad in a country where there are such horrible assassinations occurring if we could not also count priests among the victims.\\"	2005-05-29

The passage looks at the two conditions not as cause and effect or sequentially ordered, he writes. Instead, Jesus said we have both peace and trouble together. \\"Peace is not the absence of trouble; peace is the relationship we have with Jesus Christ, which deepens while we are going through trouble.\\" That single statement from the first chapter is rich enough to support lengthy reflection, with application to situations from the personal to the global. But Scanlan is just getting started.    The chapter on the connection between trouble and deeper intimacy with Jesus reminds us that following Christ will lead to inner or spiritual trouble and outer trouble in the form of conflict with the forces around us. The illustration he uses to bring that point home deals with his experience in the army. Additional personal examples bring to life such reflections as \\"We don't fear Satan and sin enough; we fear men and what they can do too much,\\" and \\"The basic lie from the evil one is the same lie that the serpent whispered into the ear of Eve: God's warning doesn't really apply to you.\\"	2005-05-16

He offers dictionary definitions for  \\"death\\" and \\"dying,\\" each dealing with endings. He then gives the Christian definitions: \\"Death is the beginning of life, life at its best, at its most real\\" and dying is \\"to start living in a most wondrous way.\\" He also takes care to explore death and dying as two different experiences that reflect continuity (existence continues after death) and discontinuity (existence after death is radically different from existence before death.)     Against that background, Shannon addresses the form of life after death, comparing it to resurrection (Jesus) not resuscitation (Lazarus) and posits that the  \\"the resurrection of the body and life everlasting\\" expressed in the Creed are experienced at the end of each person's mortal experience, \\"which, for that person, is the end of time.\\"     These are but a few examples of the richness Shannon brings to this imminently readable and thought-provoking work. Other topics include funeral rites and organ donation, diminishments of old age with practical advice on living wills, hospice care, and medical decisions. As one would expect, the author also looks at questions of hell, and purgatory, limbo, and reincarnation. The final section, What We Believe about Heaven, tackles questions about heaven as a family reunion, a garden of delight, the Garden of Eden, and the Glorious Royal City. The book closes with answers to frequently asked questions about heaven, nearly 100 notes, and an index.	2005-04-25

Swan is writing not just for those pledged to follow Benedict's Rule, but for all who seek a deeper, more authentic, and vibrant relationship with God. She begins with background on the Benedictine monastic tradition and practices, with special emphasis on prayer. The sections on Benedictine obedience are universally applicable, and Swan's reflection on asceticism is particularly thought provoking.      After years of struggling with a pre-packaged notion of asceticism consisting primarily of fasting and self-denial, Swan realized that \\"God hands us our asceticism through normal circumstances of everyday life.\\" Opportunities for asceticism include such seemingly ordinary tasks as helping a child with homework, being present to aging parents, and making healthy eating and exercise choices. She has concluded extreme views of asceticism in our own culture, which may include self starvation and other self-defeating attitudes and acts, reinforce low self-esteem and support images of a vengeful, wrath-filled God. \\"We miss out on the sense of God's gentle loving presence,\\" she writes.    Throughout Engaging Benedict, Swan inserts \\"living lectio\\" reflections that include questions flowing from the text. For example, questions related to justice include Do I dwell in the midst of a healthy community? and Am I a clutter addict? And those under humility include How do we express our personal power and powerfulness? and Do we resist the connectedness of community or receive it? The facilitator of a faith-sharing group could open this work to any section for a source of rich discussion and reflection.	2005-04-25

Twelve chapters are devoted to separate types of prayer, such as prayers for the earth and the animals, blessings, litanies and mantras.

Crosby's organization and presentation make this work truly accessible to the average reader who is willing to think and discover. Every section is a gateway to new understanding. The detailed comparison between Luke's and Matthew's treatment of the beatitudes will be enlightening for those with little formal training in scripture. The chapter on \\"blessed are the poor in spirit\\" (Luke simply says \\"blessed are the poor\\") puts to rest the confusion that often surrounds this pronouncement. In particular Crosby debunks the common attitudes that poverty is a virtue, and points out that the two evangelists paint very different portraits of Jesus' economic status. <br /> <br />With all that, the author also includes examples for beatitudinal living. For example, when discussing the merits and purpose of fasting, he points out that many Americans have heard and accept some negative images of Wal-Mart, yet instead of \\"fasting\\" from Wal-Mart, \\"blind to the justice issues involved, we go there because `it's cheaper.'\\" At the same time, Crosby is not judging or condemning behaviors such as this, nor does he exclude himself from them. Instead, his goal is \\"to make the words (of the beatitudes) come alive in the individual, interpersonal, and infrastructural levels of life for the integrity of the world and all creation\\" A huge undertaking, of course, but one worthy of us all. Spirituality of the Beatitudes is a good place to start and would be especially fruitful for a small Christian community.	2005-02-19

The final chapters on praying to St. Anthony are especially useful in answering questions about praying \\"to\\" a saint and praying \\"for\\" something specific. The novena to St. Anthony contains traditional prayers and passages from his sermons followed by reflections.	2005-02-19

The key to spiritual deepening, he suggests, is asking the \\"right\\" questions, the questions Jesus asks throughout scripture. From that premise, Pennington presents chapters on 15 separate questions of Jesus ranging from \\"What do you want me to do for you?\\" to \\"How many loaves do you have?\\" Each chapter begins with the appropriate passage from scripture and contains cultural and theological background to both the question and the answer Jesus received.  <br /> <br />Lessons we can learn and apply today are woven into the material along with Pennington's personal reflections. For example, he says God did not just create the world to spin on its own, but continues to bring it forth in a manner shaped, in part, by what we ask God to do; and \\"Sin is never an obstacle to our being healed by the Lord. In fact, it is an admission ticket if we come for healing....\\" <br /> <br />The work is rounded out by a 14-page list of more questions with citations from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. This book promises myriad opportunities for an individual or faith-sharing group to begin living with the right questions.	2005-02-14

To accomplish this aim, she relies on three major voices from the Franciscan tradition: Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, and Bonaventure of Bagnoregio.  <br /> <br />The book addresses specifics such as Clare's fourfold path to prayer (gazing, considering, contemplating, and imitating), and the Franciscan practices of poverty, friendship with Christ, and unceasing prayer as a way to live more deeply in Christ. These topics are fleshed out with background on the cultural climate leading to and encompassing the time of Francis, Clare, and Bonaventure and also details of their lives and teachings. <br /> <br />The entirety of the book is informative and inspiring, but its greatest richness lies in the author's gift for expressing spiritual concepts; example, \\"We pray not to acquire a relationship with God as if acquiring something that did not previously exist. Rather, we pray to disclose the image of God in which we are created, the God within us, that is, the one in whom we are created and in whom lies the seed of our identity.... We pray not to `ascend' to Go but to `give birth to God' to allow the image in which we are created to become visible.\\"	2005-02-03

He sees a particular obstacle in the recent  \\" major re-entrenchment by powerful curial and episcopal archconservatives\\" who continue to see the church as two separate segments, superior episcopal pastors and inferior docile laity.    In Cozzens' view, the church will never be quite the same in the aftermath of revelations involving clergy sexual abuse, abuse of ecclesiastical power, and the church's financial scandals. He believes that along with Vatican II it is the sexual abuse issue that has liberated the U.S. Catholic faithful. \\"The faithful have both the right and obligation to question structures, practices, and disciplines that no longer serve the pastoral needs of the church nor its mission,\\" he writes.    The author finds much to be hopeful about. Today's priests, for example, may be \\"polarized, demoralized, fearful, and resentful, \\"but they are also hardworking, persevering, faithful, and, in growing numbers, courageous.\\" He also expects positive changes to result from the work of organizations such as Call to Action, Voice of the Faithful, and the bishop-appointed National Review Board. The activity among these groups, he writes, may indicate that we are getting close to the \\"critical mass required to bring about meaningful structural renewal and reform\\" in the church.	2005-01-14

With his brother Phillip and others, Daniel Berrigan gained notoriety in 1968 for burning draft cards with homemade napalm in a small town outside Baltimore. To this day he continues to protest against acts of war up to and including the U.S. invasion of Iraq (publication date is 2004). This book contains homilies, reflections, poetry, and short profiles of others who have protested violence and championed pacifism over the past 35 years. Berrigan takes on the culture, the government the Catholic bishops, and the Church doctrine of \\"just war.\\" Using scripture, personal experiences, and his phenomenal gift for language, he presents his own clear and unflinching vision of discipleship.<br /><br />\\"War reveals the contempt for life implied in current forms of the wasting of life-abortion, capital murder, medical experimentation, warehousing of the aged, denial of housing and education and food and healthcare and a clean environment,\\" he writes. And \\"Christians are called to be objectors against all and any war, against `just' war, invasive war, preemptive war, defensive war, conventional war...\\"<br /><br />Daniel Berrigan's eulogy for his brother, who died last year, contains references to the story of Jesus' bringing Lazarus back from the dead. Recalling Philip's last days, surrounded by friends and family, he said, \\"I think Jesus arrived in the great tides of prayer that surrounded us with light, and thus we were enabled to give Philip up, not to death, but to resurrection.\\"	2005-01-10

But this book, concentrating only on the morning portion of the \\"Hours,\\" is organized for straight-through use (no page flipping). Though John Paul II writes clearly, this work is for studying, not reading. The introduction alone, a mere six pages, contains in-depth history of Church practices involving the psalms, all informative and inviting. Similar material is presented (under numbered paragraphs to make for easier digestion) with each psalm and canticle. In the end, I see this as a wonderful text for individuals and groups willing to make a serious commitment to prayer and learning over an extended period.	2004-11-07

We learn early in the story that he was an outgoing, charismatic man who wrote about prayer and spirituality as well as issues such as solitude and the divide between rich and poor, always expressing his ideas in terms of personal experience. We see Nouwen growing up in Holland and moving to the U.S., where he entered a doctoral program in psychology, which he finished, despite growing discomfort with certain theories but more with questions about his suitability for this arena. We witness his special devotion to the liturgy, which first surfaced when he was eight and constructed a miniature chapel in the family attic where he delivered sermons to family and friends and carefully reenacted the Eucharist. Finally we see him find a true home living among those with mental difficulties at l'Arche Toronto <br /> <br />Henri Nouwen is portrayed as a richly spiritual, extremely human individual whose life teaches us a great deal about living the gospel in modern times.	2004-11-07

The story behind Thomas Merton's struggles with censorship within his Trappist community and the Church is told in 50-some pages of introductory material. That's interesting background, especially for those unfamiliar with Merton's life and work, but more fascinating is the ease with which one can apply his thoughts on peace in the sixties to war in 2004. Addressing nuclear war, Merton points out that the question is not what is going to happen to us but what are we going to do \\"and more cogently, What are our real intentions?\\" Of political slogans applied to issues of war, Merton says \\"poorly understood and emotionally loaded cliches can do enormous harm...\\" <br /> <br />For Merton, war was  \\"the `rider of the red horse' who is sent to prepare the destruction of the world (Rev 6:4) for `he has received power to take away peace from the earth and to make them all kill one another, and he has received a great sword.'\\"	2004-10-24

He cites his own rosary prayers inspired by the African culture in Ghana and praying over the lives of those buried in the Holy Cross cemetery. His basis for expanding the conventional mysteries is the Pope's recent addition of the luminous mysteries. This work is filled with ideas and examples of possibilities for fashioning mysteries that are personally significant and spiritually enriching. This would be an excellent source book for faith-sharing groups.	2004-08-04
