It is well written, and a fast paced action story set in the future.  Much like in George Orwell's 1984, the government has run amock keeping tabs on the citizens it was elected to protect.  In this world, the politicians are evil, but the freedom fighters are knocking them off one by one.  This was a fun read.	2005-08-04

I didn't buy this book as a style guide and I don't think that writing one was the author's primary intention. Truss felt the need to vent regarding the current epidemic of punctuation misuse, and I had several giggles as I vented along with her. Truss allows that some punctuation issues aren't easy to agree on but she also points out that some rules are so simple (think it's vs. its) that there is no excuse for the mistakes we see almost daily. I don't think that a \\"non-stickler\\" would appreciate Truss's humor. However, if you've ever wanted to pull out a red pen and add or delete a comma in public, run--don't walk--to your nearest bookstore and buy this book.	2005-08-02

Sick Puppy is classic Hiaasen. The 911 tapes are comic genius. When reading them you can hear the terror stricken voices in your head. The paragraphs written from the dogs perspective give an incredibly realistic look into the brain of a black lab. I love how his characters accept the incredibly bizarre situations they find themselves in. I find myself thinking of Hiaasen characters as I read unbelievable news stories and think to myself 'How could someone DO that?'  <br />	2005-06-06

Haney, is an autobiography detailing his military career inside the Army's Delta Force. His story covers his earliest days in a Ranger battalion to his careers as a civilian after his retirement. Haney volunteered for Delta Force, and the story is told from Haney's first person point of view only as he experienced the events portrayed in the book. Haney only discusses the Force from his selection training until he retired and the men he knew, met, and worked with while in the unit. Because the book is non-fiction, the stories and accounts are very realistic and historically accurate. Having been written recently and with recent events in history concerning terrorism, this book provides a wealth of knowledge of counter-terrorist operations and what this country does about that threat. The time frame is set in the late 1970's and 1980s when terrorism was on the rise and the world was enveloped in low intensity conflicts. Haney's story covers nearly every part of the world in never-ending terror threats to which the Delta Force was deployed. From Europe to the Middle East to South America and Asia, Haney deployed and operated all around the world teaching foreign government's the art of counter-terrorism. His story includes the tragedy at Desert One, Grenada, and Panama as well as several other black ops missions around the world. This bookel is an easy one to read, as it is well written and fast paced. Haney takes no time in getting to the point of things and the narration is simple to follow. He puts military terms in terms of the layman so that all can catch a glimpse of one of America's units on the front lines of the war on terror. <br />	2005-05-27

I thought it would be a show about catching large snakes.  I guess that shows my ignorance.  That said, this book offers a great insight into America's fighting men, and the command and control they have to deal with.  Similar to \\"Blackhawk Down\\", the commanders do not givethe soldier's what they need.  Naylor's analysis of command failure in Afghanistan moves it to a higher level. He's quite explicit how the commanders of CENTCOM and SOCOM worked to block official cooperation. Naylor nails the story anyway. He footnotes sources and doesn't lessen pain by sugar coating failure. He also sheds light on why General Franks and Secretary Rumsfeld refused to allow artillery to be deployed to Afghanistan that might have changed the outcome of Operation Anaconda. My recollection of the operation was that a couple of helicopters were shot down, a SEAL fell out the back of one, and the Afghan fighters refused to attack the objective. This book lays out the details of the disaster in perspective that transforms my understanding. I was unsettled by episodes of arrogance and poor judgment from those who should have known better. Descriptions of uncommon valor help balance the picture. To his credit and humility, Naylor scarcely mentions he was embedded with the 101st at the time. This is a great book for all military history buffs.	2005-05-27

Billy Waugh has bravely and fearlessly fought in the shadows for half a century. He's hunted--and found--terrorists who top the Most Wanted lists, and here he shares an insider's untold stories about Carlos the Jackal and Osama bin Laden and others. His covert, thankless missions in the world's hellholes has not been pretty work, and what warriors like Waugh do and how they do it is not particularly appropriate for some polite conversations. But that is the point, particularly in a post-9/11 world where stopping terrorist attacks will take more brave men like Waugh. This is a well-written book, much better than most of this genre, that lays out the real underworld in a clean, engaging fashion. You're quickly taken along on an amazing life, and before you know it, you're at the last page, overwhelmed at what you've read, and wanting more. From the Jungles of Vietnam to the deserts of Africa, and to the mountains of Afghanistan, the author has seen it all.	2005-05-27

The best book I have read in years about the struggle to keep your mind on killing vice having to live with it.  The book focuses primarily on the most recent war in Iraq, but opens with the author's experience in Somalia.  I would have liked to have read more about the author's 20 years in the marine corps, but nevertheless, this was a great read.  I particularly enjoyed the author's opinions regarding the differences between an urban environment, and a jungle environment.  Also, his views on the evolution of the deployment of snipers was very interesting.  Finally, this book was a good, first person account of war.	2005-05-26

The Author was supposed to have been in the military for 20 years, and special forces for 13 of those years.  However, there are so many mistakes, it is hard to believe he ever served in the military.  For example, he has F-16 flying off a Navy Carrier.  Only the Air Force flys F-16's, and not off of Aircraft Carriers.  The Navy flys F-18's and F-14's, but not F- 16's.  The lack of technical realism, combined with poor plot development, weak characters, and a good dose of woman hating ruined the book for me.	2005-03-14

In this book, the main characters, Pitt junior and pals, just don't interest me like the seniors, whose adventures have been so good I've read all of the series. Also, the brother/sister act is slightly creepy. But what is confusing in this book is the navigation. On page 402 our boys in the blimp decide to intercept a couple of ships 45 miles due EAST of Long Beach, California. Is there an ocean in Riverside that we don't know about? Maybe the ships are running up the 91 freeway. Later, on the same page, we read that the Odyssey continues due WEST to get closer to the California coastline. Say what? Did a geographically-challenged intern write this section of the book? Finally, the concept 'suspension of disbelief' is often used concerning fiction, but in this particular story it's a little hard to do. Here we have the NUMA folks fighting an international terrorist who's launching a rocket just off the Los Angeles coast toward L.A. and we're suposed to forget that there is no military intervention handy in one of the most heavily patrolled areas of the world. As the bad boys spend hours and hours getting the rocket ready to fire, it's hard to imagine that only the NUMA people are able to defend the coast while we know that fighter jets can be on site in minutes to destroy the rocket. All in all a good story, but not a great one.  I think it is nice that Clive Cussler wants to hand off the family business to his son Dirk, but perhaps Dirk should come up with his own characters. <br />	2005-02-25

Like most great novels the reader can chose how deeply or superficially to puruse the book. One can read it simply as a page turner. Wolfe offers much more. He investigated elite colleges first hand before writing the book. Thus the reader gets social cultural descriptions of 'our best', our pre-ordained 'masters of the universe'. Wolfe is hilarious in exposing the values and behaviors of the sorority sisters and the frats. In fact there are too many memorable scenes to mention. Wolfe turns race relations upside down, examines big time college athletes, or student-athletes, economic and social class, and university culture.  The book raises many questions, and gives the reader a lot to think about. Most negative reviewers seem to take this book personally. Some get hung up on Charlotte's virginity which is really a character issue or choice. The book is about human beings, it has universal meanings and themes that are important to think about. The writing is, well its Tom Wolfe. If you want to read a book that will become a classic and still be around 50 years from now, from our national treasure, Tom Wolfe, our Mark Twain and Dickens, read, really read the book. If all you want to do is focus on reporting of sexual mores you can do that as well. If you really get upset that a female character choses sexual abstanance then you may agree with the professional reviewers. If you are stringently politically correct and can't take critques of 'sacred cows' then this book may upset you. <br />	2005-02-12

For instance, the authors suggest using scope bases with the built in windage adjustments.  The authors must have about zero experience with these bases, which are known for unintentionally allowing your zero to shift.  I don't know of any military or lawenforcment tactical shooter, or any civilian long range shooter using the scope bases and rings suggested in the book.  The best shooters are using solid steel bases secured to the rifle with over sized screws.   <br /> <br />Also, there is no up to date information on long range rifles, gunsmithing, or modern cartridge and bullet design. <br /> <br />A waste of time and money. <br /> <br />	2005-02-10

This story is based on a futuristic form of government mostly based on the ideals of a communist government but taken to an extreme. Many would argue that if our own government is allowed to intrude in to our private lives through vehicles such as the \\"Patriot Act\\", we will continue to lose personal freedoms, and find ourselves in a 1984 situation.  This book describes a world controlled with fear and kept clean and neat by the brain washed population. All have been blinded by the shadows of big brother and kept there by an enormous army ready and willing to die for their cause. George Orwell the author of 1984 and \\"Animal Farm\\" displays in both books how a society controlled by a totalitarian form of government oppresses the people iti is supposed to govern. If we allow the government to take away our freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism, \\"big brother\\" will be here. I enjoyed the way Orwell described the people as nothing but brain washed zombies mindless and more than willing to follow without question.  The book shows how easy it is for a government to lie to its people, and manipulate them. This book speaks a lot of truth and that's like a cold bucket of water in the face in the middle of a warm slow peaceful dream. The way he hits you with the truth of what could happen if a government is allowed to ru amock.  This book should be required reading for all freedom loving Americans.  Overall this book was an absolute delight to read it was interesting and suspenseful.	2004-04-21

I don't feel that I am making an overstatement when I say that this is the best novel ever written. The theme is one of man's insignificance in space and time. All we can do as humans is hold onto the present as it is. We will never change that the past has happened, that the present is happening and that the future will always happen. I first read this book in high school and then several years later when I was in college and it is amazing how the book seems to grow with you as your understanding and world views change. Vonnegut takes the reader on a roller coaster ride through the life of his character Billy Pilgram and jumps from one peak to the next valley of the various stages of his life without ever losing his main story line.

I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my must buy list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to the hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that, the characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The addition of Dirk Pitt's newly found children to the cast of characters is a little unbelievable, and certainly unwanted.  The tempo is uneven.  The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse. At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just.  Clive Cussler is a talented writer, but he must have rushed to finish this book.	2004-04-15

This book was possibly the worst written fiction book about snipers or Vietnam I have ever read.  It is poorly written, there are many typographical errors, the main characters are unlikeable and poorly developed, and the non-existant plot is unbelievable.

In the aftermath of a massacre at a football stadium, Congress passes emergency legilation banning all semi-automatic &quot;assault weapons&quot;.  American gun owners are instant pariahs, but respond to this violation of the constitution.  This book accurately portrays what could happen if the portion of American society that desires to see all firearms registered, confiscated and eventually banned gets their way.  This book shows how the &quot;gun grabbers&quot; could manipulate and shape events to spark a backlash against gun owners.  In fact, it is not too differnet from the gun grabbers using tragedies such as school shootings to further their own political ends.  The book also shows one possible response of the American gun owning public.  American gun owners have been like a sleeping giant for far to long.  Hopefully books such as this well help to awaken that sleeping giant before it is too late, and we become a nation of &quot;sheeple&quot; (to use one of the author's terms).

At least it appears from his characters in Strike Hard that everyone in the Army is dull, listless, and without emotion.  Either that or they are all afraid to speak their mind, and are still tied to their mother's apron strings, just like the characters in Strike Hard.  This is a book for guys that just want to be friends with women.<br />Despite an interesting plot line, this book was hard to read, and hard to follow.  While there were some hints of solid writing, the book was overall pretty boring.	2003-01-17

It is well written, well researced, and up to date.<br />If you own, or are thinking about owning an iguana, you need this book.	2003-01-17

This book is an excellent resource for both novice and so-called expert Iguana owners.  It would be especially useful for any prospective Iguana owner.  Iguanas grow to be very big lizards in a relatively short period of time.  They can be agressive, and territorial.  There are many husbandry requirements thatthe local pet store will never tell you.  In fact, if you follow most pet stores advice, you will end up with a dead Iguana.  This book should help prevent this from happening.<br />The first chapter is regarding whether the Iguana is the right pet for you.  It should be read before deciding on an Iguana as a pet.  remember, these are not domesticated animals.  There are also excellent chapters on housing, feeding, and socialization of Iguanas.  Finally the book disproves much misinformation provided by older books, and disseminated by pet stores.  For instance, many pet stores sugest feeding cat food to juvenile Iguanas.  What they don't tell you is that while this results in a quick growing Iguana, it also results in an Iguana dying at about four years of age from kidney failure.<br />There is an excellent resource section in the appendix, with useful websites and references to manufacturers of various reptile products including cages, food, and heating systems.<br />This book should be required reading before the purchase of any Iguana.	2003-01-17

The stories of his encounters with dangerous wildlife are interesting, but more entertaining are his stories of experiences with various types of clients he has guided.  I have always wanted to visit Africa, and plan to as finances and the political climate permit, but for now books such as this help fill the void.  Mark Ross is one of the finest writers of these so called adventure books.  As you can see from the other reviews, the worst encounter Mark Ross faced is when he and several of his clients were kidnapped by a rebel army while attempting to see Mountain Gorillas.  The story of his and some of his clients ultimate escape is both frightening and exhilirating.  One should not focus only on the kidnapping event, as the rest of the book is equally informative and entertaining. This is truly a fine book of true life adventure.	2003-01-16

Looks can be deceiving, he gave away his life savings to charity, abandoned his car and most possessions, and set off, on foot for the last adventure of his lifetime.  He hitchiked (or hoboed as he put it) across the United States, and ended up in Alaska.  His goal was to live in the wilderness, although he was totally unprepared for Alaska's harsh winter.  Many people tried to talk him out of it, but he was determined and stubborn.  One person even gave him a pair of waterproof boots, as Mcandless was wearing only tennis shoes.  In the middle of nowhere, he found an old box car for shelter.  He had a rifle, and shot a moose for food.  If he knew how to properly preserve the moose, he might still be alive.  If he had a map to find his way back from a rain swollen river, he might be alive.  The book is filled with many what ifs?, close calls, and Whys?  I'm not sure anyone can answer why, But Jon Krakauer is a fantastic journalist and presents all the facts, letting the reader draw his or her own conclusions.  Whas he suicidal, plainly stupid, or over-confident?  I think he wanted to test himself.  This book is truly a page turner.	2003-01-16

I am an avid outdoorsman, and have often thought I should just strike out into the wilderness.  Would I have beter luck, or would I plan better than Christpher McCandless?  Maybe.  The truth is I live too comfortably to strike out into the hobo lifestyle.  I both admire and look down on McCandless for his adventure.  I wish I had the audacity to give up everything to go on such an adventure.  However, he was so stupid in his lack of preparation that he deserved to die.  I could not put this book down.  I kept thinking of my self in his situation, and thinking what if...???	2003-01-13
US	52693801	R34IAY44JU40YU	0679762051	963527230	My Dark Places	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Gripping!	James Ellroy may be Amrica's most talented crime writer.  In his novels there are no good and evil characters.  Everyone is flawed to some degree.  Good and evil are more like shades of gray, rather than black and white.  As James Ellroy goes back into his childhood to write about, and attempt to solve, the murder of his mother, he gives an almost autobiographical account of his life, especially his early years.  Ellroy describes his guilty feelings at the excitement that he would permanently live with his father after his mother was murdered.  It appears that when she was alive, he felt no love for his mother, in fact he hated her lifestyle.  Ellroy may be a little to blunt in his criticisms of his mother, given his own penchant for booze and sex.  Ellroy temed up with a soon to retire LA County Sheriff's Detective, and snooped around the Jean Ellroy case, as well as another unsolved case.  This book gives an interesting account of growing up in Los Angeles and the surrounding communities.  Everything about this book was fascinating, and I could not put it down.  Like his characters, Ellroy and his family are neither clearly good or evil, but more like shades of gray.	2003-01-12

In his dark and disturbing vision of Los Angeles in the 40's and 50's the bad guys are pretty bad, but the cops are even worse.  Partially based on real incidents, and interwoven with real historical characters, Elrroy finely crafts a thrilling fictional story.  If you liked the movie, you will like the book even more.  Although quite long, I couldn't put this book down until I was finished.	2003-01-12
US	52693801	R26LAOURPL38NQ	0968505007	692456424	B-Zone : a Novel of the Gun	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	A Great First Novel!	Not only was this a great first novel for anyone, it was a great book period.  As an avid shooter, I believe all of the technical details of the firearms and related competition to be technically correct.  The cover photograph featured a Model 1911 variant in competition trim resting in what appeared to be a Kydex holster.  Some IPSC targets lay beneath the handgun, appropriately perforated with multiple head-shots. B-Zone: A Novel of the Gun is Mr. Voth's first attempt at a fictional novel.  Reading through the first pages, you soon come to realize that this is not your average work of fiction by a person outside the shooting community; someone who uses firearms as props to further their plot, but has little actual interest in or knowledge of them.  Thankfully for the reader, Al Voth knows firearms very well.  He is both a competitor and a hunter, is a former member of an Emergency Response Team, and is currently working in a forensics lab. It's always refreshing to see an author put a level of detail into his work that indicates a true love of the gun, and I'm happy to say that Al Voth does just that.  Much to my amazement, I even laughed out loud when he correctly used the term \\"magazine\\" instead of the time-honored BONEHEAD mistake so many well-known and respected authors make: \\"clip.\\"  Obviously, Al is a shooter first and author second.  You will find no glaring errors of firearms nomenclature here! <br />It all rings true in both the competitive and instructional aspect.  Few authors put this level of familiarity into their work. With respect to firearms competition, and law enforcement training, everyhting rings true.  The plot itself is quite interesting, simple, and yet well paced.  It takes several turns that keep you reading right through the evening and into the night.  If you appreciate action novels dealing with criminals, Emergency Response Teams, and firearms training, you will certainly enjoy this work.  It is fast paced, accurate, and manages to put you right into the characters' minds with comfortable ease. B-Zone: a Novel of the Gun is, in my opinion, an excellent first novel.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of firearms ownership that we, as readers, inhabit.  It feels real, tastes real, and leaves you wanting more.  If you have attended advanced handgun training or competed in any of the defensive pistol sports, you will feel like you are attending a homecoming as you read these pages.  There is much room for future plots and I, for one, cannot wait to see them develop.  My impression is that Al Voth has launched himself on a new career, and in the future you will be seeing his work growing into a series specific to the main character of this book, Nathan Burdett.  Like many other action adventures, Voth keeps the pace well. The defining difference here is that Voth actually gets the details he chooses to include RIGHT.  Well done!	2003-01-09
US	52693801	RYPLHVUE4U92O	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Not Clancy's Best Effort?	OK.  Red Rabbit is not my favorite Tom Clancy book of all time.  However, I found the book to be a very enjoyable read.  There are many familiar characters from Clancy's earlier works, and he gets the opportunity to flesh those characters out.  It is certainly more believable than Jack Ryan being the president.  I particularly enjoyed the detail of &quot;spycraft&quot; that Clancy developed.  This book could be a lesson book for wana be CIA operatives.  If you want present day political situations, this book is not for you.  However, if you don't mind re-hashing cold war politics, you will likely find this book very entertaining.<br />I can't wait for Clancy's next book, and was grateful to have been able to read this one.	2003-01-07

I like the theme of this book, but the author relies on too many cliches to excite the readers interest. The story is basically evil and greedy politicians conspire with the liberal anti-gun media elite to do away with the constitution and bill of rights.  Add into the mix the Fidelistas (Mexican invading army) and the Patriots (a group of, well, patriotic Americans wanting to fight the evil government and bring back America's greatness) And you have all the elements fo a great story.  But, this particular story doesn't go anywhere, and the book ends without any resolution.  I suppose that is left up to the imagination of the reader.  Maybe the author intends to write a sequel?  If so, I would buy it.<br />A book with a similar theme, but that is carried out with a lot more convincing detail is \\"Unintended Consequences\\" by John Ross.  I highly recommend Unintended Consequences.	2003-01-05

The author's interviews of the participants in the battle led to a realistic and unforgiving account of how the United States use of less than all available military force led to a disaster.  This book balances individual accounts of heroism against very fair critisizm of the leadership involved.  Overall this was an excellent review.  Even if you have seen the movie, it is worth reading the book.  Despite the fact that I knew the ending, I couldn't put the book down.	2002-12-31

This book was an excellent and interesting account of of Edward Bunker's life growing up in Los Angeles, and many different penal institutions.  You can see many similarities between his real life, and his fictional work.  Thge author points on many instances where prison was a different before race relations goverened friendship and loyalty behind the walls of prisons.  My only criticism is thatthe author doesn't express remorse for the victim's of his crimes.  He seems to express that being a thief is somehow more acceptable than violent criminals.  However, the book was interesting, and hard to put down.  It is a small window into a world I hope never to experience.	2002-12-31

His descriptions of the wilderness ring completely false.  As an avid outdoorsman, I find his depiction of the wilderness contradictory at best, and unrealistic at worst. Apparently the author knows nothing of firearms, specifically military firearms. His description of the story's hero, Owen Gray, holding the WOODEN stock of a modern Marine Corps M40A1, is laughable, as all current USMC sniper rifles have composite stocks. Finally, none of the characters are believable or even sympathetic. This book was painful to read and hard to finish.  Don't waste your time on this one. If you want to read an excellent fictional book about a former Marine sniper, check out Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact.

I have tried many bread recipes at home, but none compare to Nancy Silverton's recipes from her La Brea Bakery.  Many will say  that this book is not for beginning bread bakers.  This is probably true.  I belive you should try baking with commercial &quot;instant&quot; or &quot;Active&quot; yeast before you try her methods.  All her bread is made with a natural sourdough starter that takes two weeks to create, and requires daily feeding.  The result is the best bread on earth.  It is a lot of work.  I end up baking more than I can eat, but my friends and family benefit from this.  The recipes in this book take time: In most cases two days before a loaf is completed.  It is worth it.  Just schedule your time around the dough rising periods.	2001-01-17
