The result is a witty and penetrating first novel.<br /><br />Flo Kliman is just what one would expect and wish Elizabeth Bennet to be in her new setting: wise-cracking, clear-headed, opinionated, and fiercely loyal to her two best friends, May Newman/Jane Bennet and Lila Katz/Charlotte Lucas. With an able assist from Carol Newman, May's daughter-in-law and a worthy successor to the harassed Mrs. Bennet, the novel charts the course of May's romance with Norman Grafstein, who plays Mr. Bingley to cranky Stan Jacobs' Mr. Darcy. Add to this mix the buffoon Hy Marcus as Mr. Collins and the smarmy Mel Shrimer as Mr. Wickham and you get one the most amusing novels I've read in awhile.<br /><br />And like her predecessor, Miss Austen, Dr. Cohen provides an abundance of social commentary, both incisive and insightful. Very little escapes her discerning eye, from shopping mores to methods of parenting, anti-semitism to anglophilia, culinary tastes to gay rights, interior to landscape design, and senior hair styles to retirement couture. All this is served with such a mix of affection and acuity that it proves to be a very tasty dish indeed!<br /><br />According to the dust jacket, Paula Marantz Cohen is Distinguished Professor of English at Drexel University, a background I suspect gave rise to the ultimate chapter of the book, the raucous and unruly opening session of Stan Jacobs' senior enrichment course on \\"Jane Austen and Her Adaptors.\\" Many in the class hasn't read the book, but were happy to plunge into a vehemently digressive discussion, thereby providing some astute alternate readings of Pride and Prejudice. Thoroughly familiar with male-dominated family businesses, these elderly burghers had no trouble accepting the entail on the Bennet estate. Coming from cultures where marriages were often based on familial considerations, they approved of Mr. Collins' generous proposal to Elizabeth, but thought Mary Bennet might have been a better choice for him. But most of all, they thought Mrs. Bennet was the real heroine of the novel and were impressed by her Herculean efforts at marrying off five daughters, especially that Elizabeth, who was just a little \\"too sarcastic\\" for their taste.<br /><br />These are people for whom one wishes nothing but the best and who deserve all happiness. But you know they'll all make it in the end, because as Flo Kliman puts it: \\"Take it from me. A nice widower with a comfortable living can be nudged into settling down by a not-so-young woman who plays her cards right.\\"and Prejudice.

But in this, her third novel focused on the doings of Fr. Nicholas Darrow and his circle at the St. Benet's Healing Centre in the City of London in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Howatch seems to have rediscovered her voice and her center of spiritual gravity.<br /><br />This novel focuses on two characters who tell their curiously intertwined stories in alternating chapters: Carta (ne&eacute; Carter) Graham, the \\"high flyer\\" of the previous installment, and Gavin Blake, an up-market male prostitute who describes himself as a \\"leisure worker.\\" Gavin is a lost soul, a man of confused sexual identity who has been brainwashed and manipulated by Carta's nemesis, the satanic Mrs. Mayfield, and her malefic accomplice, Asherton. After a chance meeting, Gavin and Carta embark on a reluctantly shared spiritual journey that results in Mrs. Mayfield's defeat, Carta's further spiritual growth, and Gavin's salvation. Joining them in combating the forces of darkness are, of course, Nicholas Darrow; his mentor and aide, Lewis Hall, who comes across as much less jaundiced and unsympathetic in this outing; and a cast of characters already introduced in the two previous works about St. Benet's and its environs: Alice, Val, Robin, and the Tucker brothers, Eric and Gilbert. Joining them are Sir Colin Broune, a client of  Gavin's who proves to be a man of old-fashioned principle and morality, and Susanne, a former prostitute who turns out to be on an unexpected spiritual journey of her own.<br /><br />Howatch tells a gripping story and, as always, her research into the Church of England and the Anglican way is flawless. What sets this novel above its predecessors is that in The Heartbreaker Howatch has created a set of characters about whom one can truly care. Structurally, however, the novel has lots of loose ends and unresolved sub-plots. For instance, since the essentially heterosexual Gavin is truly a \\"heartbreaker\\" who has left chaos and destruction in his wake, then why wasn't making amends to his many victims part of his spiritual rehabilitation. I hope it wasn't because they were (...) and less worthy of that consideration. If Gilbert Tucker, a paragon in previous parts of the trilogy, was on a course of moral destruction, what motivated his decline and wouldn't his healing entail more than a vague promise from Nick to have a chat with him? And just what precipitated Susanne's decision to link her fate to Gavin's, since everything in their interchanges until that point was rooted in contemptuous abuse? If Howatch had answered these questions and several others like them, this already good novel would have elevated.care.

Taking as his premise that detective stories should be read as modern mystery plays, the Reverend  Stephen Kendrick argues that the sixty Holmes stories and novels are rooted in medieval fabliau, dealing with taboo subjects in a more human way than Scripture and liturgy with their overtly sacred subjects and explicit demarcation of good and evil. Drawing on the rationalistic and eclectic methods of his own religious tradition, Kendrick attempts to delineate the roots of Holmes' spirituality and finds them in Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism, especially in its Zen expression.<br /><br />His conclusions are threefold: First, he argues that Holmes' attention to detail, a key component of his character, is linked both to the Christian spiritual practice of attentiveness and the Zen practice of bare attention - seeing things as they exactly are. And both of these are inexorably linked to the pursuit of truth, the ultimate concern of all religion. Second, although to Holmes the skeptic God may often be comprehended only as a shadow, central to the stories is one clear and unambiguous aspect of the divine reality, a God of justice who rules a creation where right and wrong, good and evil, light and darkness are understood in all clarity and truth. And third, Holmes the scientist proves himself again and again to be a person of vision, able to see \\"all united\\" in much the same way Christian mystics from Julian of Norwich to Matthew Fox have discerned the interconnectivity of all things and all people.<br /><br />While no one would ever mistake Holmes the \\"thinking machine\\" as a man of religious sentiment, Kendrick proves quite satisfactorily that in Sherlock Holmes we can find a man with a great heart for whom religion was found in the details; for whom science taught that the more we know, the more we appreciate the mystery of creation; and for whom mercy and forgiveness were part and parcel of judgment and justice. After all, it was Sherlock Holmes who observed to Watson that \\"our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers.... [a] rose is extra. Its smell and its color are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.\\"ght that the more we know, the more we appreciate the mystery of creation; and for whom mercy and forgiveness were part and parcel of judgment and justice.

The comparisons are apt: all three authors used their extensive knowledge of Roman history to write glosses on their own times. But Hersey differs from the other two in presenting a far darker tale of the cynical and corrupt use of power and the paranoid behavior engendered in those who exercise it. Taking as his setting the creation and suppression of the Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 64-65 BC, Hersey provides a devastating commentary of the Nixon presidency and its response to the Watergate crisis.<br /><br />Hersey's epislatory novel is told primarily through the exchange of memoranda between Tigellinus, co-Prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and various others, mainly Paenus, tribune of the secret police. These memoranda often include intercepted letters, especially those between the Stoic philosopher Seneca and his nephew, the poet Lucan. This technique allows Hersey to extend the number of voices in the first person and to provide insight into both sides of the conspiracy.<br /><br />Hersey is a first-rate historian as well as novelist. Many of the novel's letters are based on the writings of his characters and the events recorded are generally accurate. His primary sources are Tacitus' Annals and Suetonius' Life of Nero. Seneca's words often are quoted from his Moral Epistles, as are parts of Lucan's Pharsalia.<br /><br />Through the exchanges between Seneca and Lucan Hersey explores the demands of artistic expression and individual courage under tyranny, while those between Tigellinus and Paenus probe the nature of the corrupting influence of unbridled power. Reading this novel makes one wonder what dialogues between Robert Haldeman and Chuck Colson might have been like, as well as those between Sam Ervin and Ben Bradlee.	2005-05-30

Using both statistical evidence and experiences drawn from a quarter century's involvement in prison reform, Taylor describes the American prison system as a \\"theater of terror\\" that relies on the institutionalization of prison rape, excessive sentences, and executions to maintain a prison population that has tripled since 1980 to two million.<br />Proposing a radical Christian response to this scandal as a \\"theatrics of counterterror,\\" Taylor places the Way of the Cross at its heart. To redress the agony of our prisons, he outlines a solution based in adversarial politics, dramatic action, and the building of people's movements. A God entangled in crucifixion is, in Taylor's scheme, \\"an antidote to pieties and theologies that would seek their God above the earth and its suffering peoples.\\" The executed God takes believers on a journey into the pain and suffering of a broken world and proffers the power to persist and transform. The Way of the Cross finds God in the marginalized, abandoned, and despised, the people who know life through struggle.<br />The Executed God is an important book grappling with an important topic. Taylor himself, however, diminishes his book's effectiveness. His tone is shrill and his language polemical, perhaps too polemical for those he seeks to persuade. His arguments, especially in Part Two, often rely on emotive generalities and could be more tightly structured and detailed. References to \\"gulag America,\\" the \\"theatrics of terror,\\" \\"big house nation,\\" \\"lockdown America,\\" and the like seem pugnacious rather than passionate after reading them a few times.

Entitled \\"Jesus Not Paul,\\" the long essay argued for a Christianity untainted by the arrogant and tortured Paul who, Bentham claimed, had substituted his own bad ideas (for instance, regarding sex) for the good ideas of Jesus. Thus was I introduced to the controversies that have followed Paul throughout the centuries. Was he a true follower of Jesus, his detractors ask, or was he an iconoclast who traded on Jesus' name to form a strain of religion distinct from the original message of Jesus? Were his omissions regarding Jesus' earthly life and teaching deliberate and malicious or explainable and honest? What was more important to Paul, explaining Jesus Christ or pursuing his own theological imagination?<br />Into this complex fray comes the Rev. Dr. David Wenham, Anglican priest and dean at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. Approaching Paul from an evangelical point of view, Wenham carefully delineates Paul's indebtedness to Jesus in the development of his theology and, more importantly, as the basis of his faith. In answering questions of Paul's connection to Jesus, Wenham also offers a good overview of Paul himself, from his early life to his conversion and onto his missionary journeys. Following the pattern of his earlier work, Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?, Wenham translates scholarly research and textual criticism for general readers into a readable defense of Paul. While he doesn't answer all concerns about Paul's thought in relation to Jesus' message, Dr. Wenham does make a convincing case for Paul, first Christian theologian, rather than Paul, founder of a religion subtly antithetical to the Christ.	2004-01-09

A prolific Anglican writer who is married to the former rector of Canterbury, de Waal is best known for her books about the Benedictine and Celtic traditions, and the spirit of those two Anglican lynchpins pervades Lost in Wonder. Using the image of the Celtic peregrini, who set off in their small fragile boats to go where the wind of the spirit took them, de Waal offers Lost in Wonder as a retreat for those living either in the midst of relentless activity or in a void. To that end, she focuses on the themes of harmony and balance, the light of the Transfiguration, the discipline of seeing, the relationship between our inner and outer lives, and the creation of an interior space, a cloister, in which to be silent and pray.<br />Lost in Wonder is filled with insight, wisdom, gentle humor, and good advice. I especially appreciated de Waal's suggestion early on to carry a magnifying glass at all times to help recover the gift of vision and to add an extra dimension to the way we look at the world. And like all spiritual masters, de Waal provides opportunities for the lectio divina by ending each of her nine chapters with selections from the early Fathers, the Celtic saints, holy men and women of the Middle Ages, seventeenth-century Anglican mystics, the Psalms, and writers as diverse as Bonnie Thurston, Basil Hume, Brother Roger of Taize, Thomas Merton, Ann Lewin, Alice Walker, and Edwin Muir.	2004-01-08

At the very least, they are inextricable. And yet, despite the significance of the literary impulse in making sense of Scripture, study of literary typology and analysis of literary form have been largely reserved to the scholarly realm.<br />Into this void comes Marshall Johnson's useful and knowledgeable book. Marshall introduces general readers to the major types of biblical literature -- wisdom literature, the poetry of worship, historical narrative, prophetic writings, legal collections, apocalyptic literature, letters, and the Gospels. In successive chapters, he fully delineates each type, reviews its background, discusses its distinctive features, explicates several major examples, and includes a final section of how to \\"read\\" the particular form. Johnson accomplishes all this in clear, readable, and non-technical prose.<br />As is often the case with books I wish I had written myself, I have some questions about several of Johnson's choices. For instance, is the Book of Job truly an example of \\"wisdom literature\\" or should it be treated separately as a unique type of biblical literature, perhaps as a poetic dialogue? Can Isaiah, a complex blend of historical experience and poetic concerns, be as easily pigeonholed into the category of \\"prophetic literature\\" as Marshall believes?<br />But these are mere quibbles. Johnson's knowledge of the Bible is voluminous, his theology is mainstream, and his perceptions are telling. His overarching goals are to help readers grasp the shape of the Bible as a whole and to become self-aware in their dialogue with the text. To this end, Marshall D. Johnson has written an excellent book, one which I strongly recommend. The highest accolade I can give \\"Making Sense of the Bible\\" is that, if I were still teaching my course on \\"The Bible and Literature\\" at Drexel University, I'd use it as a textbook.	2002-12-09

Their universal appeal comes from their capacity to express what we feel and that for which we yearn. In their original Hebrew, the psalms taken together were Israel's poetic and musical repertoire and served not only an expressive, but a sacred, purpose. In their manifest forms, the psalms give voice to the deepest human emotions and spiritual aspirations.<br />In the \\"Poets' Book of Psalms,\\" poet Laurance Wieder has tapped into the enormous poetic resonance of the psalms and produced a unique psalter, an anthology of the 150 psalms translated by twenty-five English poets from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. His selections are interesting. They range from the obvious -- Milton, Donne, Herbert -- to the less so -- Burns, Coleridge, Vaughan -- to the virtually unknown -- Mary Sidney Herbert, George Wither, and George Sandys.<br />Wieder brings suitable talents to the enterprise. He is himself the author of \\"One Hundred Fifty Psalms,\\" the first complete psalter written in English since Christopher Smart wrote the \\"Psalms of David\\" in 1765. He also is the co-editor of \\"Chapters into Verse,\\" a magisterial two-volume anthology of poetry in English inspired by the Bible.<br />Like anyone who knows poetry, I wondered about some of Wieder's choices. He provides a cogent answer in his Introduction by clearly enunciating his criteria for inclusion: 1. that the works stand as poetry, not just translation, 2. that the poems be without anachronisms, 3. that the version should imitate the form, not just the content, of the original, 4. that the plain be preferred to the fancy (hence the underrepresented metaphysics!), 5. that the language be accessible to modern readers, and 6. that anonymous works and versified songs be excluded. With these criteria in hand, I could understand why there were more poems by Mary than George Herbert, more by John Hall than John Milton, and only one by John Donne.<br />A useful feature of the collection is its appendix containing The Book of Psalms from the King James (or Authorised) Version of the Bible, probably the best known psalter in English. Wieder, quite rightly in my estimation, regards these poems as having \\"authority but not a living person's voice.\\" Personally, I think he might have done just as well, if not better, if he had included Miles Coverdale's translations in the Book of Common Prayer as his counterpoise. They have both authority and a living presence as poems read and spoken today.eful feature of the collection is its appendix containing The Book of Psalms from the King James (or Authorised) Version of the Bible, probably the best known psalter in English.

Barron believes that Christian spirituality - traditionally expressed in movement, practice, and apprenticeship - has been worn thin by accommodation to modernity and become a faint echo of secular culture or a privatized set of convictions. He regards the deculturalization of Christianity as beginning in the subjectivity, rationalism, and suspiciousness of Cartesian philosophy. This cultural mindset was in turn taken up by Christian apologists like Schleiermacher, Tillich, and Rahner who reduced Christianity to something best understood as interior, subjective experience.<br />The antidote to this development, Barron believes, is a return to spiritual practices that celebrate the playful, embodied, patient, and irreducibly complex working of the mind. According to Barron, we must \\"plow, climb, will, act, decide, push our way\\" to insight. To embrace Christianity as a world and a form of life, Barron delineates three paths of spiritual practice. The first involves \\"finding the center\\" and is achieved by prayer, pilgrimage, use of religious articles, and fasting. The second, \\"knowing you're a sinner,\\" is walked by means of confession, truth-telling, and forgiveness. The third, \\"realizing that life is not about you,\\" is discovered through discernment, works of mercy, nonviolence, and liturgy.<br />An especially attractive feature of this book is Barron's use of literature to exemplify and expand on his three paths. The selections are aptly chosen, with Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" used for the chapter on \\"finding the center,\\" Dante's \\"Purgatorio\\" for \\"knowing you're a sinner,\\" and Flannery O'Connor's \\"The Violent Bear It Away\\" for \\"realizing that life is not about you.\\"<br />Barron's analyses are generally well-done but there were several lapses. I question how one could write a detailed and extended explication of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" without once mentioning there was a character called Lady Julia Flyte? Less serious perhaps, but something that has always bothered me about \\"The Violent Bear It Away,\\" is the lack of emphasis on the drowning death of the young Bishop. By focussing only on Bishop's baptism by young Tarwater, Barron joins the author and other critics who don't delve into the subject of Tarwater's moral accountability for his death.<br />One final observation that I feel compelled to make. In his otherwise brilliant treatment of \\"attachment\\" as addiction, Barron makes several disparaging remarks about \\"a culture that puts a premium on good feelings and attempts to deny and medicate depression.\\" Only someone who has never experienced or observed the depredations of clinical depression could make a such an insensitive comment about the medications that allow otherwise ravaged persons to live productive and godly lives.ad Revisited\\" without once mentioning there was a character called Lady Julia Flyte?

Verily forsooth, \\"The Twylight Tower\\" doesn't live up to its immediate predecessor, \\"The Tidal Poole.\\" Despite concerns about some of Harper's historical inaccuracies, I think the main problem with the novel was a surfeit of history. Harper has reached an historical point where Elizabeth's life and activities are too well-documented to make her a credible amateur detective. In the previous novels, Elizabeth was still the despised and ignored half-sister. While the biographical outline of her early life is known, an author like Harper could exercise wide creative latitude as to how Princess Elizabeth spent her time.<br />This is not the case in \\"The Twylight Tower.\\" As the series proceeds chronologically, Elizabeth is now Queen of England. Harper doesn't seem able to devise a plausible mystery within the confines of the better known historical details of Elizabeth's summer at Windsor in 1560. For instance, the significance of her romance with Robert Dudley is much studied, as are the circumstances of the death his wife, Amy Robsart; the machinations of the Spanish ambassador; and the political fortunes of Robert Cecil, the Lord Chancellor.<br />In addition, Harper seems to be losing interest in the minor characters who comprise the Privy Plot Council. This time around Meg is portrayed as a sniveling liar, Burleigh a drunk, and Ned is barely seen at all. Too bad. These characters helped make the previous books interesting.	2002-07-02

In execution, it occasionally falls to three. So let me give it four stars and say at the start I recommend the book highly, although with several caveats.<br />\\"Glorious Companions,\\" a selection of the Episcopal Book Club, is a anthology or compendium into the hearts and minds of twenty-nine significant figures in Anglican spirituality. Proceeding chronologically, the author, Fr. Richard Schmidt, begins with Thomas Cranmer, the father of the Book of Common Prayer, and ends with Desmond Tutu, the prophet of forgiveness. In between, he covers figures as representative and as diverse as Richard Hooker, John Donne, Joseph Butler, Charles Gore, Dorothy Sayers, C.S. Lewis, and Verna Dozier. Some of his choices are inspired; it was a delight to see Samuel Johnson, a powerful writer whose writings on spirituality are largely unknown. Others, however, seemed arbitrary. Why Hannah More, for instance, but not Florence Nightingale? William Law but not William Laud? Thomas Traherne but not Benjamin Whichcote? Why Madeleine L'Engle over T.S. Eliot or W.H. Auden?<br />An especially strong feature of the book is its excellent Introduction. Schmidt writes his introductory essay as a road map not just to his book, but to spirituality, Anglicanism, and theological imagery as well. Each of the twenty-nine sections of the book are divided into four parts: an ink drawing of the subject by Dean Mosher; a short spiritual biography of the author; a selection of passages from the subject's writings; and questions for reflection and discussion to be used by study groups.<br />Generally Schmidt does a good job of placing his subjects in their historical, literary, and spiritual contexts and selecting appropriate passages for consideration and edification. But he can misstep on occasion. The section on John Donne was a disappointing example of these lapses. Schmidt focused more on Donne as a preacher of sermons than as a major English poet. Donne's poetry is difficult, but to ignore it in favor of his lesser talents is a lost opportunity for real spiritual discovery..

Greenwood is a novelist who writes well, understands the Anglican Church, and has a well-honed sense of evil. She also has created a winner in her low-key detective, Deacon Theodora Braithwaite, who serves in the fictional Diocese of Medewich. These attributes all have the makings of an outstanding mystery series. Alas, Ms. Greenwood also suffers from some of the negative characteristics of a first novelist -- namely an over-complicated plot, scant motivation for her amateur detectives to go it alone, and a not-quite-believable resolution. I still rate the book highly, though, and will be on the lookout for the two other novels in this series begun in the early 1990s. I'm sorry Greenwood didn't continue her efforts after the third. If nothing more, I'd like to know if Theodora was ever ordained to the priesthood, since at the time this novel was written, women couldn't advance beyond the diaconate in the Church of England.	2002-03-30

From the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, these under-seat ledges became masterpieces of the woodcarver's art. In England and Ireland carvers made their misericords with an artistic difference, adding supporters -- small, often round carvings that flank the main image.<br />In this beautifully photographed and elegantly written little book, Mike Harding introduces us into the world of the rarely seen misericords and their supporters. We learn that misericords are not just carvings, but celebrations of legends, folklore, the lives and traditions of common people, bibles, bestiaries, or books of hours carved in wood. Or as the author puts it in an opening poem, \\"These homespun Winter's Tales/under the bums of Bishops,/worlds upside down, and turned to give/release to rheumatic monks.&quot; And ending with the splendid rhetorical question: &quot;Did Bishops' bums have eyes to read?\\"	2002-02-12

An especially attractive feature of the book were the poems/prayers that ended each section. They were written mostly by Huub Oosterhuis with several by Sabine Naegeli.<br />I was moved by Fr. van Breemen's two reflections on forgiveness, the first on our need to be forgiven and the second on our need to forgive. He sees our own forgivingness not so much as a moral demand but as an existential necessity. Without forgiving others, we can never grasp the truth of our own forgiveness. Recognizing the difficulty of forgiving, van Breemen argues that we must engage in a process that begins with a willingness to forgive, followed by a desire to forgive taking place in our intellect and will power, and culminating in a forgiveness that comes from the heart.	2002-02-11

The central character is an old woman, Rachel Matson, dying and paralyzed, who attempts to solve the central mystery of her life and marriage. A perennial bystander to life, Rachel is aided in her task by voluminous albums of photos she has taken throughout her life -- even at her own wedding!<br />The drama unfolds slowly as more characters are introduced and we learn more about Rachel, her family, and her husband Jocelyn. In the end, the mystery is solved and, while it proves to be appalling, one can't help be impressed by the intellectual ingenuity of Rachel's laborious reconstruction.<br />The characters are finely drawn; the novel itself was elegantly written and well-structured using the tricky flashback technique in which Dickinson excels. I was disappointed, however, in its moral emptiness. Ultimately Rachel was concerned only with knowing what happened, not in understanding the events and certainly not in forgiving anyone, either herself, her husband, and those who betrayed them.	2001-12-14

Although I'm an English Use Catholic (a species of Anglican the author barely mentions and then not by name), I'm willing to concede that the English Reformation had a \\"Protestant face.\\" But Dean Zahl fails to convince that this Protestant face has endured or has ever affected the catholicity of the Anglican faith in any essential way.<br />\\"The Protestant Face of Anglicanism\\" has many flaws. Polemical in tone, strident in style, unnuanced in its history, and often purple in its prose, its brevity doesn't allow the author to make a substantial case for much of anything. The book also suffers from a lack of precision in crucial definitions. For instance, early on in the book, Zahl posits a distinction between \\"protestants\\" and \\"evangelicals.\\" But thereafter, he uses the two terms as synonyms.<br />The lack of documentation was irritating. Many of Zahl's assertions about English history and the development of Anglican theology were uncited, so there's no way to check his sources or read further. Even fascinating tidbits -- like the complicity of Thomas More in the assassination of William Tyndale -- were uncorroborated. That's too bad. More's one sacred cow that could use a dose of real history.	2001-11-24

Written as a series of fifteen meditations, \\"Heaven in Stone and Glass\\" approaches the cathedral as an intentional evocation of both Christian belief and the Christian journey. Barron's observations are rich in metaphor and allusion. His images are strongly drawn: the nave as womb, cruciformity as a way of the cross for all entrants, verticality as an invitation to transcendence, the rose as music of the spheres. He is also a voluminous reader, citing sources as diverse as the Desert Fathers, Dante, Flannery O'Connor, and Alisdair MacIntyre.<br />One criticism though. Despite his deep knowledge of cathedrals and their meaning, Barron misstated a few architectural details. Mostly notable was his contention that the flying buttress (not the pointed arch) was the architectural breakthrough that made brilliant illumination possible. But don't let this lapse deter you from enjoying this excellent book.	2001-09-21

In this case, \\"when\\" being my introduction to the thoughtful clerical detective, Father Robert Koesler, in Kienzle's first two mysteries, \\"The Rosary Murders\\" and \\"Death Wears a Red Hat.\\" In \\"The Sacrifice,\\" Father Koesler's twenty-third appearance, Kienzle explores an ecumenical setting dear to my heart: the relationship between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches, two denominations that are remarkably similar, vastly different, and deeply misunderstood by the other. To facilitate the plot, the author not only brings Father Koesler out of retirement, but his friend and Watson, the courtly and devout Inspector Walter Koznicki, as well.<br />Father George Wheatley is an Episcopal priest who is taking advantage of the so-called \\"Anglican Use Provision\\" in the Roman Catholic Church that allows priests in the Anglican Communion to be reordained in the Roman church despite being married. Father Wheatley's motives for his switch are complex and engender opposition both from his family and from Anglican and Roman traditionalists. The result is a bomb explosion at his ordination, missing the target but killing another priest.<br />Despite the beguiling plot and Kienzle's sensitive and informed understanding of Anglicanism (one flaw though: he doesn't really know how Episcopal bishops are selected), \\"The Sacrifice\\" fails to deliver as a mystery. Father Koesler spends more time explaining the Anglican ethos than solving the mystery. And the plot has too many weaknesses, including a number of separate crimes masquerading as one, a multiplicity of suspects and detectives, a plethora of one-dimensional characters, and myriad plot threads that are never really resolved -- for instance, the fates of Wheatley's closeted lesbian seminarian daughter and his ambitious daughter-in-law.<br />The Father Koesler series may have run out of steam. Kienzle has tried various ploys to revive it in recent years, most notably the introduction of a second-string priest/detective team, the long lost Tully brothers. None have really worked. Much as I hate to say it, it might be more merciful to let Father Koesler retire in peace.troduction of a second-string priest/detective team, the long lost Tully brothers. None have really worked.

Francis de Sales saw his ministry as leading people into spiritual life and relationship with God. His work as a spiritual director led to the publication of his greatest work, \\"The Introduction to the Devout Life.\\"<br />Fundamental to de Sales is the belief that the spiritual life is not just for monastics and clergy, but for everyone. He considered it a heresy to say that a lay person could not attain sanctity and holiness of life through the grace of God.<br />In a spiritual tour de force, Fr. William Meninger has taken de Sales masterpiece and reworked it into a classic of his own, \\"The Committed Life: An Adaption of `The Introduction to the Devout life' by St. Francis de Sales.\\"<br />In his preface Meninger makes it clear how indebted he is to de Sales' \\"charm, warmth, and clarity of language.\\" He was motivated, however, to rewrite the original work, rather than merely translate or paraphrase it. Meninger argues that, although the core of what Francis de Sales wrote is still substantially useful, its \\"ambiance was outdated.\\"<br />The book is divided into five parts that lead the reader through the milestones of the Christian journey. Each part is comprised of short essays suitable to daily reading. The early emphasis is on \\"scriptural meditation\\" and \\"mental prayer.\\" The latter parts focus on living an active Christian life.<br />The result is a wonderful set of insights for which we are indebted not only to the original author but to Meninger as his collaborator. If, as Francis de Sales once wrote, &quot;Liberty is a detachment of the Christian heart from all things to follow the known will of God,&quot; William Meninger has given us a modern means to achieve that detachment.Meninger has given us a modern means to achieve that detachment.	2001-07-04

Reflecting the Celtic fusion of religion and life, this anthology is arranged in four parts, each with two chapters. The first part contains prayers about heaven and earth, sea and sky. The second, day and night, animals and birds. The third, mind and soul, guidance and safety. And the fourth, wealth and poverty, life and death.<br />The authors of these prayers and poems are obscure. Van de Weyer speculates that some may have been written by Patrick himself, Brigid, Columba, Kevin, Mungo, Aidan, and David, but goes no farther than attributing their preservation to nineteenth century scholars who visited remote regions of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall, where the old Celtic languages were still spoken.<br />My favorite is the prayer on \\"Self-Deception.\\" The world would be a better place if we all heeded its call to \\"be as honest with ourselves as we are with others.\\"	2001-06-05

Her book, \\"Shaken Faith: Hanging In There When God Seems Far Away,\\" tells us how she achieved that spiritual feat.<br />For Bosco, faith is an elusive proposition and Christian faith is not an easy answer for hard times. Instead, it is a strengthener and a fortifier, a light and motivation with which to face life's problems. Moreover, it is possible through faith to realize that no tragedy is without some meaning.<br />And tragedy has abounded in Bosco's life: left to raise six children on her own after leaving an abusive marriage, she has suffered the suicide of one beloved son and the senseless murder of another. She found the answer to her shaken world in the relationship embedded in her faith. Bosco teaches us to remember that faith is two-way street and that God is faithful to us as well. In God's faith, we are provided with light for our journey. We need only respond to God's gifts with the simplicity of children.	2001-06-03

In this case, he juxtaposes a Roman Catholic parish in the north of England with the world of small-time tabloid journalism. Barnard peoples his parish of St. Catherine's with a variety of eccentric and believable characters and adds a masterly repugnant villain -- reporter Cosmo Horrocks -- to stir up a pot of parochial passions and hidden crimes.<br />Some of the more memorable characters in \\"Unholy Dying\\" are the beleaguered and persecuted Fr. Pardoe, the primly observant Miss Preece-Dembleby, the malevolent Doris Crabtree, and the frighteningly dysfunctional Norris family. My only quibble with the novel is that some of these characters are so finely drawn that I regretted not learning more about them after they made their all-too-brief appearances.<br />The book has two scenes that are Barnard at his absolute best. The first is the interview between Superintendent Mike Oddie and the Bishop of Leeds. This passage is must reading for anyone who has ever suffered from the arrogance of power and longs to see what happens when it's deflated and derailed. The other scene is the climax of the novel. Although I could see where the investigation of Horrocks' murder was leading, Barnard's terrifying and shocking conclusion caught me unprepared and left me riveted.	2001-05-28

His works usually contain mysteries, as do Barnard's, and are usually novels of manners, as are Stewart's. And like both, he is at his best when delineating complicated and ambiguous relationships whose history and roots illuminate present events. In addition, Dickinson shares the satirical wit and polished style of the other two.<br />\\"The Yellow Room Conspiracy\\" is a mystery and a novel of manners. Narrated alternately by an aged couple looking back on critical events of their youth, Paul Ackerley and Lucy Vereker, the novel evokes a between-the-wars world of Eton and country house parties followed by a post-war empire whose decline culminates in the Suez crisis.<br />The double narration Dickinson employs is an effective technique. Between them, Lucy, the society beauty, and Paul Ackerley, the archetypal outsider, recreate a series of events that climax in the death of another outsider, Gerry Grantworth, and the burning down of Lucy's family home.<br />Who killed Gerry? Who burned the house? These are the questions that Paul and Lucy finally explore after spending a lifetime together -- each secretly believing the other had.

Perseverance is worth the effort, however, and readers who stay the course will be rewarded with a richness of discernment and understanding.<br />Using the Trinitarian theology of the late Catherine LaCugna as his starting point, Downey attempts to make the mystery of the Trinity accessible to spiritual lives. He rejects a \\"dialogical\\" view of divinity (that is, the dialogue of a solitary human with a remote God) in favor of a more communal and relational approach. In Downey's view, prayer communion in the mystery of Trinity leads us to a fuller understanding of our share in the divine life and of our participation in the mission of word and spirit.<br />The second chapter of this book was its apex. Arguing that Christian life is Trinitarian life yet noting how hard pressed Christians are to articulate this central truth, Downey introduces his readers to a new \\"grammar\\" of speaking of God. These poetical \\"rules of grammar\\" are not meant to be barriers but are intended \\"to invite meaningful and truthful communication about God as well as participation in the mystery about which this language speaks.\\" Embracing Downey's grammar leads to a new perception of Trinity as \\"Giver, Given, Gift/ing.\\"<br />Another interesting part of \\"Altogether Gift\\" was its last chapter. Downey ends with fifteen prayers, points for prayerful reflection. He intends his readers to approach these points in the spirit of \\"lectio divina\\" and use them for prayerful consideration of \\"the mystery of three in one Love.\\"	2000-12-19

I'm glad I did. This author has something to say and it's worth hearing.<br />Livingston begins with two premises: \\"Life is filled with struggle. Struggle is filled with Love.\\" In the first part of her book she explores in depth the interplay of chaos and creation in our lives. Arguing that chaos is inherent to the human condition, she underscores her point with a combination of scripture, poetry, personal experience, and scientific theory. Her connection of James Gleick's chaos theory with the patterns of our spiritual lives makes her argument striking and compelling.<br />In the second part, Livingston describes how to move from chaos to creation and to find blessing in struggle \\"as we grow in hope in God's power to bring life out of what seems to be defeat in loss.\\" Her how-to list includes developing core beliefs, caring for ourselves, connecting with life, looking for goodness, deepening our joy, hanging in there, and praying. The chapter on \\"Laughing Amidst the Mess\\" was my favorite. Laughter not only helps us deal with mess, but messy situations often teach us to to laugh at ourselves.

Described by Maisie Ward as a \\"divine eccentric,\\" the mystic Houselander focused her work on those on the margins, especially troubled children and refugees. Permeating her vision of God as Father and Mother was an empathy with others, a firm scriptural grounding, a gift for seeing the divine in the ordinary, an intuitive Christology, and a devotion to Mary and the saints.<br />In \\"A Child in Winter: Advent, Christmas, and Epiphany with Caryll Houselander,\\" Thomas Hoffman has selected passages from Houselander's works and organized them into a series of daily meditations for Advent and the twelve days of Christmas. He provides a scriptural passage to introduce each meditation, followed by a brief comment and closing prayer.<br />The meditation for the Saturday of the first week of Advent has stuck in my mind. In a passage from \\"The Passion of the Infant Christ,\\" Houselander makes a distinction between \\"expensive\\" and \\"simple\\" people. Expensive people are those whose demands on us -- whether because they are \\"untruthful or touchy or hypersensitive or that they have an exaggerated idea of their own importance or that they have a pose\\" -- are so complicated that \\"we cannot respond spontaneously and simply, without anxiety,\\" to them. Simple persons, in contrast, are those who accept themselves as they are and consequently make only minimal demands on others. In his comment, Hoffman takes Houselander's trenchant remarks and suggests that fidelity to our baptismal vows will move us away from being \\"expensive\\" persons and result in an honest gift of self to others.	2000-12-11

Nor are unattractive characters the novel's only transgression. More jeers to the gory and unconvincing plot of \\"Mortal Sins.\\" When the mystery is finally solved, the resolution is so unconvincing that readers might wonder why they bothered.<br />The book's writing itself, however, is its worst feature. Williamson' characters speak some of the most egregious and convoluted purple prose since Bulwer-Lytton was a best seller. As an example: here's Damon's analysis of Remy's allure: \\"He knew what lived inside of her, and it was dark. She could run a race with a train, and put a loaded gun to both her head and yours. She could make you so crazy with lust-desire that you'd strip yourself down to guts and bones to have her.\\"<br />Yikes!

This book of essays, written originally as a  series of articles for professional journals like &quot;Review for  Religious&quot; and &quot;Pastoral Life,&quot; allows Morneau's thoughts  wider circulation. &quot;Spiritual Direction&quot; itself is divided into  two sections:  Principles of Spirituality and The Practice of Spirituality.  The first section is more thematically unified and focuses of the  principles of prayer, discernment, asceticism, and spiritual direction.  Each chapter in this chapter posits ten tenets, substantiated by a series  of quotations giving the source or effect of each tenet and a commentary  developing its implications. The chapters in the second section are more  independent of each other and less structured. They address such diverse  topics as reverence, spiritual exercises for eclectic nomads, the defense  of joy, and Quaker spirituality. I was particularly struck by Morneau's  thoughts on asceticism and reverence. I hope that someday he will write  more linking these two concepts.  He argues -- successfully in my  estimation -- that asceticism is essential to Christian spirituality. To  Morneau, &quot;asceticism, that voluntary participation in the full life of  another, is essentially relational.&quot; This thought dovetails nicely  with his chapter on reverence, which he sees as a &quot;profoundly communal  virtue that creates an atmosphere&quot; conducive to spiritual growth.	2000-07-24

But if you're interested in a book of meditations based on the Daily Office, there is  none better. From Resurrection to Pentecost is the third of a series that I  hope will eventually include the whole church year. Providing daily  meditations for the seven weeks between Easter and Pentecost, Morneau's  format is effective.

Some of them,  like William Blake and Gerard Manley Hopkins, were familiar to me. Others,  like Ralph Wright and Morneau himself, were delightfully new. The selection  for the Friday of the Third Week of Easter was typical. Reading Anne  Higgins' \\"The Space Window at the Washington Cathedral\\" allowed me to preen  a bit in my Anglican identity, but, more importantly, it illuminated  Morneau's insight that \\"the Eucharist is God's stained-glass window.\\"	2000-05-26

But author John Kirvan fails in his task to stay focused and  to satisfy our hunger. The problem with this book is, I think, its  rootlessness. Taking an ecumenical approach to Western spirituality, with  sources as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Rumi, the Kabbalah, and Hildegard of  Bingen, the book fails to fulfill. Particularly disappointing were the  prayers, which at times bordered on the incomprehensible.	2000-05-19

The series has potential, but Peale will need to smooth out some of the rough edges before she has a real success.<br />On the plus side,  she's captured the cityscape of late Victorian Boston very well. She's also  created a complex and riveting mystery for her trio of engaging amateur  detectives to solve.<br />On the minus side, the pace of Peale's writing is  so frantic that readers barely have a moment to assimilate new information  before the trio is dashing off to the next suspect. She also has some  difficulty in establishing an appropriate diction for her eminent  Victorians, always an issue with period mysteries. And finally, Peale has  perhaps unconsciously adopted some of the social snobbery of her period.  Her depiction of the police as uncouth louts is worthy of a Cabot or Lodge  at his most Brahmin. And she never adequately answers the question of why,  however poor, it's so important that her patrician hero, Addington Ames,  not be forced to seek gainful employment like the rest of us mere mortals.	2000-05-18

Life is not an exercise to be endured, the author tells us, but a mystery to be unfolded. Life comes from the living of it. The attitudes and  insights of our lives are based on our pursuit of the presence of God,  often in the most ungodly of times and situations.<br />The purpose of  Illuminated Life is to teach us to be contemplative in the midst of chaos.  To facilitate this, Chittister divides her book into a series of  alphabetized meditations on spiritual qualities ranging from  &quot;Awareness&quot; to &quot;Zeal.&quot; Each meditation begins with a  story from one of the early Christian Desert Mystics and follows with an  essay that moves the reader from principle to praxis.<br />The stories are  delightful and show both depth of scholarship and sensitivity. The essays,  designed for reading in one sitting, are insightful and wise. My favorite  is on &quot;Growth.&quot; Beginning with a story about Abba Mios, it segues  into a discussion of life as a never ending process of growth and change,  whether we like it or not. According to Chittister, growth is based on  choice. Every day of our lives we grow a little more into God or a little  more into self. After reading Sr. Joan, it would take a truly hardened  heart not to grow into God.	2000-05-11

Aurelio Zen is a thinking person's detective and a modern Italian version of the world-weary, incorruptible, and cynical hardboiled detectives of the 1930s.  The mystery itself is compelling, with a ghost story as the key to  intricate, overlapping conspiracies. But the glory of the book is its  Venetian topography, along with its insights into Zen's psychological  terrain and finely-honed sense of justice. I highly recommend this book.	2000-05-10

There's an engaging young man embarked on a quest for his parentage, a bit like the earlier Out of the Blackout. Then  there's the solving of a 35-year old murder to help clarify current events,  much like A Scandal in Belgravia. Finally, there's an unexpected homoerotic  twist, like...oh, how many Barnards shall I name? All in all, this was a  fast-paced, interesting, and engaging mystery. Not Robert Barnard at his  best, but Robert Barnard in good form.	2000-05-10

Although it contained all the elements I love about Susan Howatch -- her knowledge of the Church of England, her deft use of multiple narrators, and her ability to capture the  spiritual dimension of human endeavor -- this work did not meet the  standards of her previous Starbridge novels. The characters and improbable  plotting were the problems. Besides Alice in the first section of the novel  and a surprisingly deep Rosalind, the characters were unpleasantly  self-indulgent and self-absorbed. It was impossible to find much redeeming  about the misogynistic and homophobic Lewis, who was much more finely  nuanced in Howatch's earlier Absolute Truths. Even worse, it was difficult  to muster up many positive thoughts about Nicholas, the wonder worker  himself.<br />An especially unpleasant aspect of the novel was its  \\"MacGuffin,\\" that is, the device or event that precipitates the crisis at  the center of the novel. In this case, it was a tragic death. The other  characters, Christian healers all, are so absorbed with saving their own  skins and Nick's ministry that, with the exception of Alice, don't even  bother to pray for their lost colleague. It makes one wonder why Nicholas'  ministry was so worth saving.	2000-05-07
US	52544548	RCD86ILB86PCG	0061044032	636476335	The Ivory Dagger (Miss Silver Mysteries)	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Caught by a Cough	According to the dust jacket of \\"The Ivory Dagger,\\" \\"Miss Silver is one of the most likeable of the spinster detectives.\\" Be that as it may, this reissued period piece by Patricia Wentworth needs more than a likeable detective to salvage it. A classic country house mystery, \\"The Ivory  Dagger\\" contains the three necessary ingredients of the genre -- a  convoluted plot, a limited group of suspects, and detectives too clever by  half. The plot is interesting enough but shifts too many times to be truly  effective. The characters are too stereotypical to be real, even for a  dated English mystery. They include a hapless heroine, a hypermacho hero, a  dastardly decedent, a feckless footman, a stolid male secretary, and  a  spurned female secretary. Throw in an imperious titled lady and a stately  butler and you get the picture.<br />Miss Silver is likeable and for that  reason this book gets an extra star.  Miss Silver's foil, Detective  Inspector Abbott, is likeable as well. Another Savile Row suited, gentleman  detective, Abbott is a lot more palatable than his more famous rivals, the  truly snobbish Roderick Alleyn, the impossible Lord Peter Wimsey, and the  downright strange Albert Campion. The third member of Wentworth's detecting  trio, Chief Inspector Lamb, is the best drawn of the lot and genuinely  funny.<br />One small point. Miss Silver has an annoying habit of  communicating her thoughts by coughing in code. She coughs throughout the  novel. Sometimes she \\"coughs gently,\\" at other times she \\"coughs mildly,\\"  once she even \\"coughs reprovingly,\\" mostly though she just \\"coughs.\\" Miss  Silver coughs a lot, although I gave up counting after thirty. She should  get someone to look at her throat.	2000-04-27

Wicks uses passages from an interesting range of spiritual  masters upon which to reflect. These include people like Abraham Joshua  Heschel and Henri Nouwen, two favorites of mine, and Mark Twain, an  unexpected delight. Wicks also summarizes his main points as  &quot;Spiritual Tenets&quot; at the end of each chapter. I found that very  helpful.	2000-04-22

Interesting, because Simak presents new insights in the longstanding debate between theology and science, faith and knowledge. Clever, because Simak's characters and their worlds are  breathtakingly imaginative. He peoples his planet, the End of Nothing, with  a variety of fascinating creatures, from robot cardinals to a computer pope  to a sentient cloud of molecules. All have souls and all seek the truth. In  many ways, this novel reminds me of C.S. Lewis -- had Lewis not been so  sure of himself and his theology.	2000-04-22
