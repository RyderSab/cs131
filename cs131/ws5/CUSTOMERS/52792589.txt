I don't understand why this excellent series doesn't stay in print. This book, the second in the series and published quite recently in 2002, is just as good as book one, Death is a Cabaret. I've scavenged the web to find the rest of the series. Luckily, the most recent titles are still in print, but if they disappear as quickly as the first volumes, you'd best get them now. The mysteries are excellent, the antiques information plentiful but not distracting, and the characters fully realized. This series is *excellent.*	2005-09-29

I'm still reading this novel, so my review must be read with a skeptical eye. However, I'm seeing a sameness to this entry in the series that seems to appear in each of Leonard Goldberg's Joanna Blalock novels. She's always broken up with Jake at the beginning, only to reunite (I suppose) by the end. It's always raining in Southern California (this is desert, Mr. Goldberg, despite the lush lawns and sprawling golf courses), and the threat/target seems obvious (although I'm hoping for a surprise here). This doesn't lessen my enjoyment of the books, however. The medical investigation aspects of the novels are wonderful, the action keeps you reading, and there are enough roller-coaster moments to leave you breathless. What *does* tend to drop me out of the story is Mr. Goldberg's insistence at putting in not-so-subtle simplistic messages of the liberal ilk, which prompted me to stop reading and write this review. Airing his politics in a fictional manner spares him from having to support his views with facts. I was so irritated, I checked some of his idiotic claims, and they were as false (or at least simplified to the extent they had no merit) as I suspected. Stick to story telling, please, Mr. Goldberg. It's what you're best at.	2005-08-29

I'm still having trouble with Skye Denison, the main character of this small-town series. While I enjoy the author's use of locale and her knowledge of psychology, I find the character of Skye very unlikable. She has a need to help people; she wants to be seen as independent; she feels compelled to get to the bottom of things. Yes, I think it's all about Skye's feelings, not the people she hurts, alienates, and leaves fumbling in her wake. She lies. A lot. Cute, pert, trying to be funny little white lies. She lies to justify her meddlesome nature. I may never like Skye, but the mysteries are engaging enough to keep me reading. I just wish the main character had a little more integrity to go along with her mystery-solving acumen.	2005-08-25

There was a sense of familiarity when I started Deadly Harvest: (spoilers)(spoilers) Joanna and Jake are once again split up, Joanna winds up in the hospital after someone tries to kill her, then she disappears from the hospital when someone tries to kill her again. I'm starting to worry about the poor woman's health; one more severe concussion may finally do her in.&lt;g> However, even with these complaints, the book is entertaining, the plot intense, the characters interesting.

Although still well within my definition of formulaic, this debut novel in the Domestic Bliss series is also refreshing and entertaining. There were some unfortunate typos and the occasional bit of grammatical license that left my head spinning, but otherwise the book is competently written. The two main characters are somewhat stereotypical, but their personalities may take on more original aspects as the series continues. I like mysteries that may be classified as American cozies, and this is another fine addition to the genre. I look forward to reading the rest of the series, but hope the author takes time to describe the locale and expand her characters to make them more original.	2005-07-27

Thus far, only one of the authors I read has come close (Donna Andrews). The formula is pretty basic: a protagonist who has one quirky best friend, another who's gay/lesbian/transsexual, and a smart/hunky cop or dumb/fat cop who may or may not suspect the protagonist of a crime. These protagonists generally have ordinary lives until they're compelled to investigate a murder. While the formula works in many cases, it *is* becoming tiresome. This novel, first in a series, forces the humor a bit but is otherwise an entertaining read. Besides, I must be tolerant of the formula because I seem to keep reading it! Enjoy!	2005-07-21

Although this novel falls short in the mystery category, its characters and pace kept me interested until the end. I really didn't want it to stop.

Sometimes, I find Tempe a hard character to like: she's written as being a know-all who finds all the clues the police miss. But the mysteries are solid and the forensic techniques brilliantly described so that the reader doesn't fall asleep from information overload. I do get a little distracted by all of Reich's road names and directions. I found the ending disappointing. Why does the protangonist have to behave in an utterly stupid way in order to get into trouble? There are better plot devices that would enable the same result without turning the character into an idiot.	2005-06-10

Kathy Brandt has developed excellent characters and a strong sense of the British Virgin Islands in this second book in the series. However, as with her first, the mystery is a little thin. While still very entertaining and a must-read in my permanent library, I wish the author would stop revealing clues so early that the reader knows the solution before the main character.

This book definitely is worth a read if you like culinary mysteries (and I do). However, I was surprised that the book was originally published in hard cover; it reads like a novice writer's paperback original. The characters are painted with a broad brush: the \\"not nice\\" people are really, really not nice, while the nice people are overly nice. The author overuses attribution, which can become annoying if you're a reader who likes good writing. Also, I find the lack of POV requires Ms. Crawford to use proper names in overabundance. Then there are the times I'm not really sure which of the sisters is speaking, because it sounds like one while being attributed to the other. Hmmmm. These are minor flaws when compared to the number of writers who shouldn't be allowed to string words together for money, but they are an irritant to someone who appreciates a skilled use of language. As a final insult, the recipes are for some of the most mundane dishes mentioned in the book. Read the paperback; it's entertaining and fun. But don't bother with the hard bound edition.	2005-05-25

Raised by a white couple in the metropolis of Anchorage, Nathan tries to find his native roots while solving mysteries closely related to the Inupiat culture. The novel is entertaining as a mystery, but it is the vivid narrative about place and culture that gives the book its real punch. Enjoy!	2005-05-05

Cynthia Baxter's second book is certainly far better than her first. Her plot is more complex, and her cast of supporting characters better evolved. However, I still have trouble with her two main characters, Jessie and Nick. Jessie is naive and self-centered to the point where the reader has to resist a temptation to shred pages from the book, while Nick remains something of an unknown.

This is the second Scrapbooking mystery I've read, and I'm not sure I'll bother with another. Her writing style is ineffectual, her dialog sounds as if her characters are uneducated, and her grammar is appalling. Okay, perhaps I'm being too critical of these paperback originals, but the books show no tendency toward improvement. On the plus side, however, I have to give credit to anyone with the determination to get herself published.

I want more of Meg and Michael and the whole, odd-ball assortment of friends and relatives who populate their lives. The books are well-written, the mysteries are entertaining, and the humor is decidedly in the vein of Janet Evanovich. They're laugh-out-loud funny in the midst of mayhem and danger.

Then again, while Jessica Popper may be good with animals, she's definitely not a people person. And I don't mean that in a good way. Instead of eccentricities that would make her an entertaining character, Jessica packs so much emotional baggage she needs to see a shrink. I have no clue what her ex-boyfriend sees in her neurotic behavior; then again, I have no clue what Jessica sees in him, either.  <br /> <br />The mystery elements to the story are fairly good, but the author is heavy-handed about doling out clues. Jessica is a lousy detective; she gathers good information that enables the reader to solve the crime long before she figures it out for herself. There's just the inevitable wait for Jessica to fall into the arms of the murderer and finally realize her mistake. The whole damsel in distress angle. How dull. <br /> <br />All this said, I yet may decide to read the second book in the series. I like amateur sleuths and regional mysteries...	2005-02-24

Part of it may be because I knew the \\"who-dun-it\\" and \\"why\\" fairly early on in this book, and therefore I needed the main characters to keep me interested. Also, the lack of the author's usual humor allowed me to see more of the main character's weaknesses, which may have tainted my opinion. Sarah Booth Delaney is a good friend and a good detective, but she also is a miserable woman wallowing in the past. She keeps her history wrapped around her like a cloak to avoid doing anything productive with her life. She might as well go lie down in the family plot and get it over with; the past is where she is most comfortable.  <br /> <br />Still, one sour experience will not stop me from anticipating the next Mississippi Delta novel.	2005-02-18

I was a little put off by the introduction, which seemed to be heavy on emotion and light on true information (sort of the way I think a liberal would try to make a case for something). However, with Chapter 1, all the doubt vanished. Charen has done the research and she has the facts, which she recites bluntly to counter the arguments of the liberal left. I think she proves the case that African-Americans are no more than pawns in the liberal agenda. This book should be required reading for every African-American, so they can become more informed on the issues and the facts surrounding liberal myths. The truth will hurt, but if we think back and recognize the abysmal failures of the left-wing agenda, we will begin to realize that the only ones who benefit are criminals and socialists. Look at the education system; in its years under the liberal approach, the United States has gone from first place to third-world status in the quality of education. Take a look at crime; crime drops under conservative leadership and rises dramatically under liberal leadership. The ones who suffer are minorities and the poor who are victimized by the criminals. Yes, the left has distorted and omitted the truth to incite a mistrust of authority and engender racism against whites, but Charen reveals the facts to debunk the stories. Read it; think about it; question it. Everyone needs to become a more informed voter, and this book will help us all to get there.	2005-01-19

I listened to this book on cd, and it is hilarious. Coulter doesn't hold back when it comes to lambasting liberals, and her sarcasm comes through clearly in her voice. I think reading the book would lessen its impact unless you're very familiar with Coulter's style and personality. However, while the book will have you laughing out loud, inside you'll be cringing at the absolute accuracy of her comments. Yes, she's witty and sarcastic, but she's also right. Wonderful book; excellent as an audio cd. Either way you \\"read\\" it, it will be an education.	2005-01-19

There are too many authors today who should be banned from using the word \\"couple\\" until they've learned to add the word \\"of\\" after it! Ms. Childs' incorrect usage of the word is distracting, mostly because she uses it so much, and I find myself dropping out of an otherwise engaging story. Yes, I'm a grammar fanatic; I believe if people are being *paid* to write, then they have a responsibility to set an example by using correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation. I'll grant that \\"couple\\" may stand alone in dialogue, since few people bother to speak correctly. The protagonist of this novel, Carmela Bertrand, speaks average English, so her overuse of the word \\"couple\\" can be excused. However, to include it in the narrative is a felonious assault on the English language. Over reaction, you sniff. Perhaps, but the number of authors spreading this linguistic disease is resulting in the dilution of our language. Language evolves, but changes should add clarity and richness, not sound like drunken belches. Note to authors: It's \\"couple OF...\\"	2005-01-15

I confess that, with the exception of the Dark Tower series, I stopped reading Stephen King many years ago. I was baffled how an author could write himself happily into a corner, and then just toss in an ending. The Dark Tower series is a wonderful journey filled with dynamic characters, a noble quest, and really scary monsters. I've been with it since the first volume in the series was originally published. When was that? 1977? In the final volume, Stephen King once again spectacularly demonstrates his inability to wrap up his story. In fact, he tries to convince us (heh-heh) that it's the journey, not the destination, that makes a good book. I suppose that's his excuse as he smiles all the way to the bank and chortles at readers who hoped to find purpose in this fascinating tale. King wanted to write an epic \\"book\\" in the vein of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings; in fact, I've described earlier volumes as the flip side, or dark side, of Tolkien's greatest work. But Tolkien wrote with a purpose. King's work will be forgotten quickly in the annals of literature, I predict, because he consistently writes himself into those pesky corners that defy any semblance of conclusion.	2004-11-10

The characters are great, and if you've read this far in the series (the books should be read in order) you're either hooked or masochistic. I can't decide what that says about me. Being a mystery buff, I'm dismayed at the lack of actual \\"mystery\\" in these books. Usually, the title gives you the 'whodunit'; maybe Ms. Robb doesn't want to cause her readers any anxiety by making them wait for Dallas to solve the crime. In the case of this book, the answer wasn't in the title, but rather in something equally as obvious. But I'm still reading them because I love the characters and their interaction. No one plays a minor role in these stories, which is in itself an accomplishment. Yep, definitely my guilty pleasure.	2004-11-05

Since I'm on the last book, I must be enjoying them. Definitely light-weight reading, the sort of romantic fantasies with which a teenage girl would populate her imagination. Then again, I'm well beyond the teen years, so perhaps these \\"fannish\\" plots push buttons within us all. I also confess I just started reading this book, so I can't comment on the plot or the characters, although I've certainly addressed these subjects in my reviews of other books in the \\"...In Death\\" series. No, this time my complaint surfaced early: with the murder weapon. A knife. Okay, that's cool. But from among the assortment of kitchen knives ranging from the paring variety to the largest chef's knife, what does Ms. Robb choose as her murder weapon? A bread knife. You know, a bread knife of the \\"blunt end, serrated blade\\" variety. What did the killer do -- saw the victim to death? Then again, what does it matter when the characters are so delightful that the mystery hardly matters. I guess it matters to me, for I am an veteran mystery reader.

Robb has found an interesting niche in this futuristic romantic series. Primarily a romance writer, her books are appealing but predictable. Stereotypical characters (rich guy meets average gal and falls hopelessly in love) are given lively originality. Still, the romance is fantasy in its purest form and is bound to capture the hearts of women everywhere who daydream about these same unlikely scenarios. Unfortunately, the series was recommended to me as a mystery series. While the crimes and police procedure of 2058 are a curiosity, Robb doesn't deliver any suspense. I mention this because when I reached this book, the 4th in the series, I knew instantly what the crime was going to be. And I mean instantly. I'll continue to read the series because I enjoy the characters, however implausible the situations. The books hit all the right buttons for those who love strong women with inner vulnerabilities; just don't expect to be challenged by the mystery elements. <br />	2004-09-15

I think it's inevitable that Forgotten Realms is compared to Tolkien's Middle-earth. To me, that's a good thing. I'm still reading this first trilogy, and it's a great tale on its own. The familiarity to Tolkien only makes it better for me. I can imagine this series taking place in Middle-earth, perhaps far to the north in the icy wastelands. The various people are familiar as well: elves, &quot;halflings,&quot; dwarves, men, etc. But the character of each person is Mr. Salvatore's own, original and unique.<br />I have only one complaint, which is minor and based on my belief that the written word should be as correct as possible. I sincerely wish Mr. Salvatore would learn the use of the colon and semi-colon to help alleviate a plethora of commas. <br />So, if you can't get enough of Middle-earth, try the Forgotten Realms.	2004-06-20

If you're a fan, you'll still love it; just don't expect a heavy dose of mystery.	2004-05-11

As a recent transplant to the fantasy genre, I bought a bunch of books with interesting covers. This is perhaps not the most scientific way to purchase books, but I fell in love with the Lord of the Rings movies, then the books by JRR Tolkien, and I was hungry to continue the adventures. This series fits the bill perfectly. It is full of heroes, humor, angst, action, and sacrifice. The characters are fully fleshed out. Even the minor characters, the ones you learn to care about despite the fact you know they probably won't survive until the last page, are well-rounded and distinct. Magic is used sparingly, and always to chilling effect. Someone said this series is not great literature. Well, I find most of the books in the &quot;literature&quot; section to be dull as day-old toast. I am proud to be an action-adventure junkie! Legend feeds the need.	2003-05-19

I'm a recent transplant to the fantasy genre, having arrived via the Lord of the Rings movies, thence the books by JRR Tolkien. Hungry for some heroic fantasy-adventure, I bought a bunch of books with interesting covers. Sadly, this series is too mindless even for me. Since it is a series founded in video games, I suppose I have nothing to complain about. The Band of 4 is interesting enough, and they manage to plunge into one pointless adventure after another where they use magic to extricate themselves. Failing that, someone with greater magic comes along and rescues them. Without realizing its foundation, I thought the book much like a video game, where players advance from one level to the next to confront different hazards and a multitude of villains. In fact, this book has so many villains, it should have a playbook, not that most of the bad guys are distinguishable from one another. They exist only to cause mayhem for the heroes. But if you like your reading so shallow that the author should be accused of causing a creative drought, this might well be the series for you.	2003-05-19

Thomas Zigal's books evoke the wild beauty of the Colorado Rockies while gently mocking the glitz and artifice of Aspen's weathy elite. His characters are well-rounded, the plots are articulate and interesting, and his writing is lively and articulate (high praise from a voracious reader who bemoans the grammar faux pas of so many of today's popular writers).	2002-09-06

I've admired Tammy Bruce's insights since her radio talkshow days, which might sound a little strange coming from a middle-aged, straight, conservative, non-feminist-activist woman. But her intelligent and precise debate of many various issues made me an instant fan. This book is Tammy at her best; it's filled with hard-hitting analysis backed up by equally hard facts. Only someone deeply involved in the movements she discusses could produce such a powerful indictment.	2001-10-30

However, I'm still plowing through this novel by Keith R.A. DeCandido hoping his plot will overcome his technical difficulties. I understand this is not his first novel, but he obviously has not honed his skills with practice. A basic course in grammar and punctuation would improve his style considerably. I've read more evocative vocabulary in a true/false test.	2001-09-07

Having said that, I was less than thrilled with Tripwire. In previous novels, Child uses a few deft scenes to describe his vicious, soulless villains. In Tripwire, Child structured his story in such a way that a lot of time had to be spent with the villain. Therefore, there are numerous scenes of sadistic cruelty. Their repetition, while stylishly written, left me feeling fatigued and frankly bored. Yes, we found out the villain is bad. A bit later, we realized he was very, very bad. By the time Child convinced me the bad guy was very, very, very bad, I no longer cared and simply wanted the character put out of my misery.<br />Having lodged this complaint, however, I found the overall plot wonderfully complex and entertaining. I still think Jack Reacher is the finest hero since Travis McGee.	2001-08-22

They're an enjoyable, quick read. Her style is competent but basic. There's a dash of humor, a lot of comfortable, neighborly dialogue generally unrelated to the plot, and characters that are interesting but not captivating. <br />My major emphasis in professionally published books is on style. The printed word is the last bastion of our rich language, and therefore correctness should be a strong consideration. Heaven knows I'm far from being a grammarian (but I'm struggling to learn after a less-than-perfect education), and there are a couple things that bother me about her books. Yeah, a &quot;couple things.&quot; You'd think after umpteen books, someone might have mentioned to her that it's a &quot;couple *of* things.&quot; I find this consistent, persistent error distracting and annoying. In dialogue, a &quot;couple'a things&quot; is acceptable to indicate a character's manner of speech, but in narrative, it's a no-no. Unless the rules of grammar have changed since I was a child, you can have a &quot;few things&quot; or a &quot;couple of things,&quot; but not a &quot;couple things.&quot; <br />Finally, the books should be read in order, and I think the earlier ones are better. The first books in the series have more of a mystery plot, with clues presented for readers, and a generally clever solution. Later books don't provide all the clues, so when Jane figures out whodunnit, the reader hasn't been privvy to the information prior to the solution.	2001-08-22

I've found him in Jack Reacher. I was clueless when I purchased the book based on an Amazon recommendation, and I was hooked from page 1. Author Lee Child creates well-rounded, fully developed characters and places them in jeopardy in plots that are original and wonderfully complex. The amount of technical information actually *enhances* the action; you barely have time to breathe before being thrust into another life-and-death confrontation with evil. Okay, I'm in love with Jack Reacher, all right? He's way too tall for my tastes, but that's the magic of imagination -- I can make him Richard Burgi in my mind! If you love mysteries with a hard edge or jaw-clenching adventure, you must read this book!	2001-08-03

She weaves a beautiful tapestry of the land and the skills required to survive as a pilot in its unforgiving ruggedness. However,  while her heroine seems competent in the air, her invesetigative skills  still leave much to be desired. The red herrings were not quite as obvious  as they were in the first book, but the villain was apparent to anyone who  reads a lot of mysteries. Rust relies on dropping the solution out of thin  air, so to speak, instead of creating investigative acumen in her  character.  Here, it's the heroine impulsively  walking into the one store  in all of Anchorage where she could find the answers she needed. Still,  it's a fine second book. I love regional and small town mysteries, and Rust  delivers with her vivid descriptions of Alaska. She improves with each new  book. I see she has a third one on the way. I can hardly wait.	2000-02-21

Lane does an admirable job of showcasing the collision of old and new amid the unforgiving winter of the oil-rich Alaska frontier. His hero, police officer Ray Attla, has a foot in both worlds -- the native culture of his  ancestors and the modern world of law enforcement. Elements of mysticism  play a role in Ray's pursuit of a killer, but the plot is complex enough to  keep the reader guessing until the end.<br />As with most novels being  published today, this one could have used an editor skilled in the rules of  basic English, but &quot;Elements of a Kill&quot; is still a good read in  spite of such mistakes as 'breaks' when the meaning is clearly 'brakes'.	1999-08-10

Megan Mallory Rust weaves a colorful portrait of Alaska and displays a keen knowledge of the flying she clearly loves. However, as a mystery writer, she is a disappointment to this die-hard mystery buff. To give her  main character something to investigate, she made the rest of her  characters unbelievably stupid--I know more from simply reading books than  her investigators know about crime scenes! The criminal is obvious almost  from the very beginning, and the motive for the crime was quite literally  spelled out. Sadly, the only tension she manages to create is within the  reader, who wonders when the heroine will finally unravel the obvious.  <br />However, as much as I didn't care for the mystery elements of this  story, Rust still manages to convey a good sense of modern Alaska and the  thrill of flying. I'll certainly read her next book to see if she's  improved her plots. <br />As with all novels being published today, this one  could have used a good editor; I am forced to wonder what the publishers  are using for their hiring criteria -- a willingness to work cheap,  knowledge of basic English not a requirement?	1999-08-10
