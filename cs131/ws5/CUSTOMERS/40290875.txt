So much hype, so much press, so much talk that I thought the book could never live up to my expectations. I was happily wrong. This novel was without question the most fun I've had reading in years.  Absolutely a terrific can't put it down novel. I stayed up many nights well past midnight reading this one.  Hurry up, buy it and read until it's done.

The best fantasy novel I've read this year by far!  Sanderson is a fine new addition to the world of fantasy. Only reason he gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because there were several parts within the novel which I thought dragged a bit.  This novel is in the same league with The Briar King.  Buy it! Read it! Enjoy it!	2005-07-19

In fact I held my breath towards the end waiting, hoping and praying everything would be tied up in a nice neat bow.  Unfortunately (in a good way) that was not to be.  I can't wait for the next novel in the Conclave series--too bad it will be another year before I can continue.  Much, much better than Feist's other most recent series.  If you're looking for something light, yet fun and exciting, to fill the time until A Feast For Crows finally hits the shelves this is the ticket. <br /> <br />Thanks Raymond.	2005-07-02

Frankly, given some of his more recent work I'd been told I hadn't missed much.  I loved his first series Magician, et. al....Those were truly fun, enjoyable and well-plotted out novels.  Anyway, my buddy at the local bookstar encouraged me to give this recent series a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  I'm enjoying this pulpy-type series very much and the middle towards the end of this novel was a true page-turner.

I recently read the War of Souls trilogy and loved it. I had been putting off reading any Dragonlance novels for years as I assumed they were all schlock.  Well, the War of Souls proved that these novels were interesting, well-written, and fun.  Based upon my good experience in reading that triology I decided to start at the beginning and see what came before the War of Souls. I just finished DoAT and while i enjoyed it, parts were incredibly slow and I struggled to push myself through it.  While I still plan to read the next 2 books in this trilogy I've switched gears for a bit and I've just started Raymond Feist's newest triology, Talon of a Silver Hawk.  I think I'll finish that series before heading back to Ansalon.   <br />	2005-06-03

Generally I consider myself somewhat of a Highbrow Fantasy snob, e.g. George R.R. Martin, Tolkien, Donaldson, etc., and hence, I figured these books were just lowbrow trash.  Well, I was really wrong.  Let me get something straight here, I'm not comparing these novels to any of the works of the above-referenced authors; however, these novels, each around 600 pages long, were enjoyable, fast-paced, great stories, and kept me hooked.  I drove through all 3 novels in 2 short weeks.  I enjoyed them so much I've now started at the beginning of the Dragonlance series, Chronicles, and while I've completed the first novel in that series (which I didn't enjoy quite as much as these 3), I'm hooked right now on the Dragonlance world.  <br /> <br />Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.	2005-05-27

I've been skeptical for some time about these Dragonlance books. I thought the were probably silly and just some novels written to try and get you to buy game settings. Well, I finally gave in and read this novel as the story looked interesting, cover drew me to it.  I loved it, and I've already picked up now the entire series of War of Souls books, Legends and Chronicles. I've in fact already read 200 pages in the second book in the series now. What a great thrill ride.  I'm absolutely hooked, particularly since as I understand it these three books aren't even the best triology in the series.   <br /> <br />Buy it, try it...you'll love it. <br /> <br />	2005-04-30

That was one long, long, boring novel. I just re-read the online reviews to figure out (1) what I missed; and (2) what the heck this novel was about. I am an avid reader of fantasy novels, and considered myself somewhat seasoned as to what makes a good fantasy novel and what makes one quite dull.  I count A Song of Fire and Ice among my favorite books of all time, although I'll pick up a shlock fantasy  novel from time to time just for a quick, easy and fun read.  This novel, however, was absolutely horrid. Sorry Scott. I really, really tried to like the book. In fact I tried 3 times to stop reading it and move on, but I wanted to fair about it and make sure maybe the whole book wasn't simply a set up for the next book and that maybe, just maybe it would get better.  It didn't, I'm extremely disappointed as the guy at the book store who generally makes incredible selections led me to this one. This was the first time he let me down...<br /><br />Well on to the next series, The Matzalan Series by Scott Erikson...Already much better than this one...Unfortunately I jumped the gun, as I have the tendency to do, and own the 2nd book in the series which I purchased on-line at Amazon.ca (Canadian site)... oh well it will look nice on the shelf next to the first book, since I have absolutely no intention of reading it....	2004-09-14

Although this book is a satisfying conclusion to the First Demon War Saga, I found parts of the book slow going.  I really began to miss run ins with goblins and powries and other sorts of evil doing cretures (there is an amazing battle scene 3/4 of the way into the book between Elbryan and evil doing creatures).  The back and forth between the monks and king and elves got to be a little repititive, but since this book closed up a lot of open issues from earlier books I continued to read on.  When Elbryan died I thought I would scream.  I must say I was pleasantly shocked that Salvatore took the risk and killed off the main character in the book. These books are not battle driven like Salvatore's Drizzt books; however, I beleive you will enjoy if you open your mind and allow yourself to enter the new world of Corona.	2004-03-13

Salvatore, as always, kept my attention and focus and I truly enjoyed turning the pages. My only complaint is that after the victory over Dactyl (maybe/maybe not?) the story begins to focus more and more on the Abellican monks. At times I found this boring and lacking of slow.  Once the goblins and powries left the stage the story began to grind to a slower pace.  Although I did eventually get into the new direction of the story, it did take some getting used to.<br />Overall I'd recommend you pursue the continuation of the First Demon War Saga and pick up this novel.  I look forward to reading the Demon Apostle.	2004-03-13

Yes this novel, like the first, is graphically bloody, contains sexually explicit scenes, a lack of prominent female characters, but it is original, fun to read and I can't wait for the next book.  Newcomb and Del Rey don't pay any attention to the crappy reviews posted all around this review. This is good fun stuff. If you like swords, magic, and action this is the series for you.

First of all let's just get it right out of the way, this book is graphically violent, sexually explicit, the story is not original, the writing is less than perfect...BUT...I loved this novel. I was totally and completely entertained, and the novel grabbed and kept my attention.  When I read a novel, I don't sit there and think is this original, is this something new, how has this author ripped someone off; rather, I considered whether I realize I'm reading something and if I'm taken away and entertained. I was completely taken away from reality (remember that's why this is called the Fantasy genre), and entertained throughout. This is not Harry Potter, and definitely not for the Harry Potter readers. If you're expecting a light, happy, funny, kid focused novel stick with Harry and Dumbledore because this is definitely not a book for you. If instead you can handle dark, oftentimes graphic violence and explicit sexual situation with a story that will quickly capture your attention and beg you to keep reading then pick this one up and enjoy yourself. <br />Give Newcomb a break, he's not Tolkien or George R.R. Martin and never pretends to be. I will say he's leaps and bounds above Goodkind (now if you want to complain read some of Goodkind's nonsense).  I anxiously await reading Gates of Dawn.	2003-09-27

Although the ending picked up a bit, i really missed the action and adventure and excitement from the first book. Although I'll definitely read the next book (i already own it) it'll probably be awhile.  overall I thought this book was about 300 pages too long...there was no need for this book to have been 700 pages long. I loved the swords and socerery and fighting and action of the first book soo much, i can't say enough how disappointed i was in this book.

I couldn't put it down, and read it in three days. I raced out and bought this book to continue my journey through the Forelands.  Boy am I glad I did. This book picks up pretty much where ROA left off. The pacing and characterizations were excellent as well. Political intrigue, swords, socerey, magic, romance, fighting, poisoning...what else could you possibly ask for. I'm frankly surprised more people haven't discovered this author or series. Very fine work, and great mindless fantasy.  My only complaint about this book (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) was that there was not nearly enough interplay with the 2 main characters, Tavis and Grinsa, as I would have expected. I realize Coe's setting up the next book, and introducing Aneiria to the audience to  show the evil Weaver spinning his magic down south of Ebithar, but I would have liked more focus on Tavis and Grinsa.  Oh well, I'll just have to wait until the next book, Bonds of Vengence, which hopefully will be out soon. I can hardly wait to see what happens. PIck this book up, as well as ROA if you haven't already read it---i guarantee you will not be disappointed.	2003-08-27

The author has come up with an extremely unique, and quite fascinating way to handle magic (&quot;endowments&quot;) in this novel.  That premise alone kept me reading and reading.  What's most interesting, however, is that although described throughout the novel as the &quot;villian&quot; Rah Ahten (ROTTEN--how clever!) you get the sense he may be more like the villains of the George R.R.

That's absolutely correct...I have no idea how he does it, but honest to goodness this series just keeps getting better!  I have read hundreds and hundreds of novels in my life, but I can not begin to tell you just how amazing this book is.  George R.R. Martin is simply the absolute master.  Recently I've read a tremendous number of fantasy novels (e.g. Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, War of the Flowers, Dark Elf Trilogy, Riftwar Saga, Icewind Dale Trilogy, etc).  Nothing else I've read compares to this book.  The characterizations are fascinating. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, Martin sends one of your favorite characters on a spiral. I must say I sat there with my mouth wide open and jaw dropped in awe during the Red Wedding scene....amazing...applause, applause, applause...If you haven't read either this book or this entire series by Martin you are truly missing out.

After completing the Song of Fire and Ice Series by George R.R.

Still hungry for more I read the Riftwar Saga by Feist which I really enjoyed. Although I'd purchased a copy of Otherland for future reading, I'd never read a book by Tad Williams, and so when the bookstore clerk recommended this book I decided what the heck I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did. Easily the best of all the recent fantasy (as well as past) reads I've ever had. I loved this novel. Theo is a fascinating character. Williams does an amazing job descirbing him and sharing this character with the audience. Unlike the previous reviewer, I thought the novel picked up incredible amounts of steam once Theo traveled to Fairie. I loved the characterizations, and Williams ability to make a ready feel like he's right in the middle of a scen is down right amazing. I could not stop turning the pages or racing home to read more of the novel. I've now raced out and purchased the Dragbone Chair so that I can begin to experience more of the imaginiation of this most incredible author.
