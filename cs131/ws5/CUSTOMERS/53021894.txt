This is one of those great non-fiction books that is as hard to put down as any thriller.  I was familiar with many of the psychology experiments that Slater covers in the book, but she helped me think about the experiments and what they say about humanity in new and different ways.  At first, I was a little taken aback at the way she injected herself into the narrative, but ultimately, I think it was a very effective device to further bring home the fact that these experiments and how we respond to them say so much about the human condition.  This book should be an enjoyable and fascinating read for anyone with even the slightest interest in psychology.  And for those who really know psychology there's all sorts of interesting details and interpretations that go far beyond what you ever learned in college.  Great stuff!	2004-02-23

The methods in this book worked wonders on our recent baby.  My only regret was that this book was not out in time for our colicky first child who would have benefitted enormously.  I recommend this book as strongly as possible for every new parent.	2003-01-14

Some may write off Rosemond as old-fashioned, but it seems to me that he takes the best of older and newer parenting styles to create an overall highly effective approach.  I am especially impressed by his emphasis on understanding the developmental stages of your toddler so that you will better be able deal with the problems that inevitably arise.  Definitely the best parenting book I've read and highly recommended for all parents of toddlers.	2001-07-15

To me, Tolstoy's absolute genius lies in his ability to so perfectly and thoroughly get inside the heads of his characters.  They are all stunningly real and human.  Tolstoy frequently made observations about people and relationships that just stunned me because they were so obviously true, but I had never conceptualized them as such myself.  In short, I think what makes this an exceptional novel is Tolstoy's unparalled insight into the human condition.  This insight results in wonderfully-drawn characters that will surely never be forgotten.  It was not always easy making it through the nearly 1500 pages, but it was most definitely worthy it.  I can also highly recommend the Signet Classic edition translated by Ann Dunnigan.	2001-05-21

Conover really gives the reader a sense of genuine prison life which is not always apparent from TV and the movies.  Conover also really appreciates the moral complexity of how we treat criminals and the many paradoxes inherent in the relationships between prisoners and their jailers.  The book abounds with intriguing anecdotes as well as Conover's keen insights into criminal justice.  I would recommend it for just about anybody.	2001-03-07
US	53021894	RTGZMTJ90BSCM	0553580930	101241499	A Man in Full	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Just plain fun reading	Wolfe's bestseller from a couple years back is an enormously entertaining, satirical, yet all too real take on America at the close of the 20th century.  Set in Atlanta, the paths of bankrupt real estate entrpreneur, Charlie Croker, and escaped felon, Conrad Hensley, are inexorably drawn together to the book's climax.  Along the way, their stories hilariously touch upon themes of capitalism run amok, race relations, sex relations, crime and punishment, aging, trophy wives, and ancient Stoic philosphy.  I'm not a great fan of satire, but Wolfe does it so adroitly with such well-drawn and entertaining characters that I found this book hard to put down.	2000-12-24

Amersterdam tells the tale of how the death of a woman sends three friends of the deceased, a politician, a journalist, and a composer, into a bizarre spiral of changing relationships.  The characters were never completely real and the story was never fully engaging.  The ending of the book struck me as so absurd as to be laughable.  This book has certainly received high praise elsewhere, so maybe it's just me, but I will not be recommending this book to anyone.	2000-12-24

Neil's story had me hooked from the very first page.  As the web their deceit slowly closes around both son and father, the story becomes a fascinating psychological exploration of the relationship between these two men.  Watt's first person narration seems to wonderfully capture the inner life of a high school jock who heretofore had never thought of others and was always getting away with things due to popularity and athletic prowess.  A fine book on many levels.	2000-12-24

The stories of each of the pilgrims were masterpieces of short fiction in their own right.  Although I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan, I give it 4, rather than 5, stars as I found Simmons' writing to be at times over-descriptive and somehow lacking the true can-put-it-down momentum of a master storyteller.  Although I am one to appreciate some ambiguity at the end of a novel, I felt like after all the build-up, Simmons owed us more at the end of the story than the obvious compulsion to turn to the next book in the series.  With the right ending, I would have been left thinking about the many great themes in the work.  Instead, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed.  Nonetheless, I certainly look forward to continuing this series.	2000-12-24

The whaleship Essex was rammed by a massive sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific ocean, forcing the crew onto three small whale boats as their ship went down.  What followed was nearly three harrowing months of dehydration, starvation, and ultimately cannabilism on the open ocean before some of the crew were miraculously rescued.  Philbrick tells the tale quite well, with great realism and suspense.  He also expertly provides the context of the Nantucket whaling industry in the 19th century.  A fascinating, inspiring, and disturbing tale.	2000-12-24

Rather than truly engaging the ideas of Socrates and others, however, they are almost thrown in at random to provide the illusion of an intellectual depth which is really not there.  Otherwise a pretty standard, and admittedly enjoyable legal thriller, but I was expecting a lot more.  Finally, the rather important plot twist at the end was a little too predictable and utterly implausible.  If you want to think while reading courtroom tales, stick with Scott Turow.	2000-12-24

US	53021894	R1YL1UPPWU15F5	006019541X	351520335	Blue Angel: A Novel	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Superficially entertaining, but ultimately disappointing	I found this story of a English professor at a small liberal arts college facing a midlife crisis to be all too familiar.  The tale focuses on Ted Swenson, a creative writing professor living off the fame of his long-ago first novel who can no longer seem to write.  He's inspired in the form of Angela Argo, a talented, troubled sophomore in his creative writing class who is writing a novel about a student having an affair with her teacher.  It's not long before Swenson's love of Angela's writing and her unchecked ambition have the two of them into bed together, ultimately sending Swenson's life into a somewhat predictable talespin.  I suppose for someone into the literary world, Prose's satirical take on creative writing courses and the literary world may be quite entertaining.  I found her skewering of small liberal arts college and their politically correct sexual harrassment policies to be a bit dated and derivative.  For a truly hilarious campus novel, you cannot beat Richard Russo's The Straight Man.	2000-12-24
US	53021894	RH0MFEAUUHWAN	0670886106	415039519	Saint Augustine: A Penguin Life (Penguin Lives)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Fascinating interpretation, but not for the Augustine novice	I really loved this book for Wills' powerful refutations of the Augustine I learned about in college-- an intolerant, negative person totally obsessed with sex.  Wills presents a much more humane and spritually uplifting view of Augustine.  Wills thus spends much of the book refuting earlier, seemingly erroneous interpretations of Augustine.  For this reason, it seems important that one have at least a rudimentary knowledge of Augustine to fully appreciate Wills' approach.  Though primarily focused on Augustine's theological development, Wills does a fairly good job of helping us to understand Augustine the person.  It is in this area that I which Wills had delved deeper, for the information and insights here were most interesting.  All in all, an inspiring and thought-provoking read.	2000-12-24

The characters and setting came alive and truly seemed to be the product of a different time and place.  The  intricately-plotted mystery was well-told with momentum building  throughout.  I have only a little interest in financial markets, yet I  found Liss's explanations of the nascent British stock market fascinating.   I also found this book just as compelling for its portrait of the role of  Jews in 18th century England as well as the nature of crime and punishment  during this period.  This book is well worth reading on many levels.	2000-07-05

It was certainly not a traditional mystery, as the truth behind the pivotal murders is revealed halfway through the book.  The real mystery was trying  to understand the true nature of past and reality as told through Mr.  White's interspersed first-person journal entries.  Mr. White's journal was  well juxtaposed with the tale of Wesley Horner, the down-on-his-luck cop  who arrested him.  The two interrelated tales work well together to really  make the reader think about issues of love and loss, truth and fiction, and  the nature of human freedom.  The plot never quite reached the  can't-put-it-down level, but the well-told story, in often beautiful prose,  really sticks with the reader.	2000-07-05

This novel did prove to be a rather entertaining and compelling thriller, but it  nonetheless left me disappointed in several regards.  <br />In Plum Island,  John Corey's humor had me laughing out loud every chapter.  Here, I found  Corey's personality much less amusing and even annoying at times.  It  seemed to me like he was trying to hard.  I also think this book would have  greatly benefited from a good editing job.  It would have been an extremely  taut 400 page thriller; at nearly 700 pages it was definitely bloated.   DeMille spent way too much time on utterly irrelevant detail such as  conversations between the Lion and private pilots flying him about.   Finally, I really liked the technique of interspersing chapters narrated by  Corey with chapters describing the actions and thinking of the Lion.   However, DeMille dropped this during the climactic final section of the  novel so that we never really understood what was happening in the way we  did earlier in the novel.<br />Despite these complaints, I still enjoyed the  book and I am glad I read it.  I am just disappointed in that it seemed  that it could have been so much better.	2000-06-09

You certainly do not have to have any familiarity with the  military to apprecciate the extraordinary human drama and fast-paced  narrative.

I also loved the way Livesey shifted point of view between the characters, gradually revealing more of each person as they were seen through others' eyes.  The characters were extremely real and well drawn  and Livesey writes very well.

It had the fine characterizations, compelling plot, and moral focus as Lehane's other books, yet I thought that it too  often became a standard serial killer thriller.  One of the things I love  about Lehane, is that I usually cannot predict what will happen, but here  too many plot points seemed straight out of 100 different serial killer  movies.  Nonetheless, predictability and all, this was a highly  entertaining book which I found difficult to put down.	2000-03-21

After all the reviews I read, however, I was expecting something a little bit more.  Krist's characterizations were better than in your average thriller and the novel had a very good sense of time and place, but  once I finished, that was it.  It certainly did not leave me thinking about  larger issues, etc. afterward.  If you're looking for a compelling and  well-written thriller, this is an excellent choice-- just do not expect  anything more.	2000-03-14

I thought it was a very pleasing combination of art history and modern comedy.  Except for a few overly detailed digressions into art history (and I do like art  history) the book moved along well.  On the downside, although the narrator  was likable, most of the characters seemed rather two-dimentional.   Furthermore, though I did get a few laughs, the book was not nearly as  funny as I was hoping for.  On the whole, though, well worth  reading--especially for an art lover.	2000-03-10

Lethem's evocation of the unforgettable, Tourette's-suffering narrator, Lionel Essrog, is just amazing.  Lethem takes you right into the mind of a Tourette's sufferer with emotionally  compelling and often hilarious results.  The story of Lionel and his fellow  &quot;Minna Men&quot; and what happens after the murder of their mentor and  psuedo-father, Frank Minna, is entertaining in its own right.  Though I  wouldn't change a thing, I was sorry this book was only 300 pages, because  I would've liked to spend a lot more time with it.	2000-01-21

Turow presents a compelling, nuanced tale in which major characters are both good and bad and in which there are no easy answers.   This is a very entertaining and compelling legal drama as Robbie Feaver  tries to entrap various federal judges on behalf of the FBI.  This book is  special, though, because of the attention to detail and character.  The  reader really gets to know these people and they are full and  three-dimensional, with both positive aspects and failings, rather than  caricatured two-dimensional characters as in so many works of  &quot;legal&quot; fiction.  This was an excellent book on many levels and  well worth reading.	2000-01-21

Doig writes wonderfully and he has a terrific sense of character and setting, but all too often the story lacked a sense of direction.  The murder subplot seemed  hardly more than an afterthought and I thought the book would have been  much improved had it been more fully incorporated.  I find the construction  of dams very interesting, so I was really looking forward to learning about  them while enjoying the story, but it did not work.  I think the problem  others have with the focus on the dam is that Doig never actually explains  its construction in clear, understandable detail, a la Crichton.  Its  always just bits and pieces that never fit with a coherent whole.  In sum,  good, definitely not great.	1999-09-10
