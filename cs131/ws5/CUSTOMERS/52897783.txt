His analysis/review of dropping crime levels in major cities and widespread cheating in schools is definitely worth your time.  He has done his homework and knows how to look for meaningful data and work it effectively.  But often, as he goes beyond basic analyses, his positions become shaky and it shows. The main problems with his work: One, he makes a big deal of saying that he has no unifying theory . . . which means you can't criticize any inconsistencies in his work (ha, beat you to the punch!).  Second, he hammers home the point that \\"other experts\\" will put their own interests ahead of those of the reader, so be careful of \\"all those users\\" out there . . .  but Levitt, himself, is completely trustworthy (verrrry different) and he is writing solely for the reader's edification (hence don't even look for hucksterism in his work that might be aimed at making the book a profitable little project regardless of what it takes).  Finally, he wants you to believe that he is unique: an economist who treads where none have gone before.  Actually, that's partly true in that he is an economist who likes to tackle matters usually addressed by sociologists, psychologists, and political scientists, but with a conspicuous absence of training in those areas.   Hence, he goes from quantitative to qualitative analysis in a way that will astound those who actually have experience with the matter at hand.   Step right this way, folks . . .  just watch your step.	2005-09-11
US	52897783	RTTUCHDSWBI0D	1594200521	351679934	Finding George Orwell in Burma	Books	5	3	6	N	Y	Insightful and disturbing	This is a powerful, well-written book that will open eyes - especially for anyone not familiar with what is happening in Myanmar today.  The present regime is killing the soul of the country, bit by bit, despite much propaganda that insists otherwise.  Yes, new and refurbished hotels look swell and whirlwind tours have become expert at whisking visitors past the glorious sites at mind-numbing speed, but if you are smart enough to venture off the beaten track just a little, as Ms Larkin does, you will learn much.  Larkin shows how Yangon and other cities have been reduced to \\"memory\\" (ghost of their former selves) and \\"meaning\\" (if you care to ferret out the \\"real\\" state of affairs in the country).  Larkin does a wonderful job of interviewing a broad range of citizens to lend a personal, emotionally-gripping view of what could easily be intellectualized and safely kept at a distance while reading this book in a room, in a house, in a country far, far away.  She also does a bang up job of connecting the dots between Orwell's life, his writings and the country that became so deeply imprinted upon him.  Having said all this, do I have any gripes?  Yes.  First, Larkin occasionally comes up with odd descriptions that seem to reveal more about herself than her subject.  A group of men huddled in a tea house are described as \\"girlish and secretive.\\"  ??   Second, while railing against a regime which censors whatever is politically inexpedient, since commits the same sin herself.  She is a journalist in Asia and soft pedals the Burmese-Chinese tensions (lest she offend those with whom she does business should her cover be blown?)  Yes, those mansions in Maymyo are often owned by the military elite and drug lords (as she says), but many are also owned by Chinese who are given preferential treatment due to their business investments while local Burmese are forced out of the way to make room for these invaders.  The tension cannot be missed; it is palpable.  Also, likely out offear of alienating other powerful entities which can make life nice or nasty for her, she deliberately \\"misses\\" every opportunity to draw parallels between policies and practices of Myanmar's oppressive regime with similar policies and practices which have crept into what is supposed to be the model democracy in the world, the Shangrila with a system so craved by the Burmese people (Myanmar government officials censor every written article and news broadcast while pretending this doesn't happen; the Bush administration blacklists any journalist who asks \\"difficult\\" questions - denying that journalist access to future press conferences, etc -  so that all journalists impose strict, self-censorship while pretending that this doesn't happen).  Drawing such parallels would force the reader not to simply see this as a tale of what can happen elsewhere under extreme circumstances, but, ironically, what can happen even under his nose, under \\"ideal\\" circumstances.  And that would add an important message to this worthy project, one summed up by the exhortatory words of a citizen quoted in the book: \\"We Burmese are experts at looking for what is not there.  It's something you should learn to do, too.\\"	2005-09-09

Yes, for all the reasons that many other reviewers have put forth, but also for this one: It shows that the true value of reading books is how it makes one observant, well-rounded and introspective.  Paul peppers his story with asides and very funny digressions that highlight what one might ordinarily miss while tramping through life and that actually serve to connect things more than any straight forward story could.  His sense of humor is self-effacing as much as it is directed at anyone or any culture so even when biting, it is never less than beguiling.  Like Abe Lincoln, he cannot but see the ludicrous in life and distills his observations into quips and anecdotes that enlighten and entertain.	2005-08-13

This is a light novel meant to entertain while you pass the time.  I read it comfortably in two sittings while nursing the flu and was nicely taken out of my aches and pains for the duration.  Does it break any new ground on the concept of time travel?  No.  Are the characters memorable?  Not really.  Time travel is given a treatment more like Back to the Future than some spinoff of Hawking's musings in Universe in a Nutshell.  But the book jacket says as much \\"It is in the best sense of the word, an entertainment.\\"....Washington Post Book World.  Yes, there are also some gaping holes here and there (aside from the worm holes), but if you rent Hollywood movies (which are thin on logic and continuity and fat on flash and fun) you'll hardly notice.  Those who come to the book expecting riveting insights and razzle dazzle sci-fi will be disappointed.  Those who come to the book for a guilty pleasure of getting away from working on a thesis, dealing with screaming kids, or simply taking an easy break from the harsh international realities that assault us daily may appreciate the little breather before getting back to business.  Don't make a habit of this, but go ahead here if you are fascinated by time travel and love to read anything about it.	2005-01-18
US	52897783	R1X9BAENIQ16ZP	1891661280	510611553	A Prayer for Burma	Books	4	14	15	N	Y	Enlightening first person account	A Prayer for Burma is the account of a Burmese-American who travels back to Burma (now Myanmar).  In the opening, he says, \\" . . . returning to my motherland, just as an estranged son would to the mother he left behind, I hoped to get a better understanding of this colorful cultural mandala that was\\" part \\"of my identity.\\"  He then takes us along on his fascinating travels, sharing what he sees, what he thinks and what he feels.  While this description might sound fairly direct and simple, the process and product are anything but.  The author struggles to understand what any foreigner might, but he also struggles to settle feelings that only a foreigner who looks like the locals might need to do.  And he willingly opens himself through his honest writing so that we benefit from his struggles, his defeats and his triumphs.  Having just returned from Myanmar I can say that many of his insights still seemed valid in late 2004 and proved helpful during my trip.  The scare about the planes, however, is somewhat dated, though I'd still stick with the private airlines (the government airline does tend to slam into the ground a bit too often).  One thing to keep in mind while reading the book is that there is no such thing as The Burmese.  The experience of different tribes can be vastly different.   Hence, don't generalize beyond what is written about any particular person.  Yes, everyone wants more freedom, but the most oppressed groups have it harder, see fewer opportunities and are likely to give very different responses when asked about things.	2005-01-18

Many readers rated this book highly, but I thought it was terrible (at least the first 50 pages; that's as far as I got).  The plot is a good one, but it doesn't get fleshed out right.  The writing, in general, is trite and stiff.  The dialogue is peppered with amateurish prompts and awkward explanations of what a character just said.  Example:   <br /> <br />\\"and I remember how happy I was once.\\"  <br />\\"Why were you happy?\\"   <br />\\"I forget. Who knows?  It is enough to remember the fact of the happiness.  I'm sure I was happy.  Otherwise I would never have bought such a beautiful tie.\\" <br />\\"It's not beautiful now,\\" said Pete.  \\"It's stained.\\" <br />\\"Is it?\\" Adam leaned toward his reflection.  \\"It looks fine to me.  I am really happy to be losing my sight.  Everything looks fine to me.  It is the best evidence I know that there is a God.\\" <br />\\"What?\\" (Convenient prompt so he can do more explaining) <br />\\"That he dims our vision as we age.  Otherwise it would be too horrible to bear.  Especially for those who were beautiful when they were young.\\" <br />\\"Were you beautiful when you were young?\\" (Computer generated response) <br /> <br />This is not how people talk, it is how characters in bad lit talk. <br /> <br />Or how about this for stiff prose? <br />\\"Good evening, Adam,\\" said Carloine. She did not turn around. <br />\\"Good evening,\\" said Adam. <br />\\"Please don't say anything more about my painting,\\" said Caroline. <br />\\"All right,\\" said Adam, \\"Except really, the colors --,\\" <br />\\"Please,\\" said Caroline. <br /> <br />This guy really likes the word \\"said,\\" said the reviewer.

This book is a selection of photos from that trip through Germany as well as trips across Europe in the following two years.  Fantastic concept, I'll admit.  The end product, however, is mixed.  There are some photos worthy of framing, but also some shots that leave one wondering: \\"they picked this shot from the many that must have been available?\\"  The cover photo, of course, is priceless.  Others that warrant a gasp include the Reichstag as a mere ghost of itself, the Hungarian soldier whose coat flaps in the breeze symmetrical and opposite to that of a figure cast as towering statue, and an Italian woman with stones perched upon her head, carrying her find away from a bombed building.  But others lack oomph and stand up less well to the many post war images that any educated adult has seen over the years.	2004-08-25

But it's strength lies in its ability to help the reader track the many players in this epic.  A straight reading in a standard text can become confusing due to the many characters with unusual names who flit in and out.

I then read through the Amazon reader reviews and almost changed my mind.  Glad I didn't.  I won't say that none of the readers' criticisms are valid (see entries below), but I think it's too easy to fall into the Princess and the Pea mindset when evaluating \\"somebody else's\\" work.  A reader owes it to the writer to try to understand the writer's angle (yes, everybody has one), then evaluate the work based on that, not whether or not it is the same as your own.  Hence, what Abley does well is to take you around the globe to sample life in remote areas where native languages are severely threatened.  He doesn't just address the language itself, but shows why the language matters . . . showing glimpses of residents' lives, filling out \\"issues\\" with flesh and blood.  The end result is a mix of travelogue and commentary on linguistic food chain processes.  If you have read extensively in this area, this may not be the best choice for you because it does not offer great depth in any one area.  If, however, you read widely and wish for a volume that helps to \\"connect the dots\\" on important and evolving issues across the globe, then this book is likely to please.	2004-08-15

It also does a good job of listing hotels (though it's not the best for lower end venues).  The book is frustrating, however, in that the person who makes the maps does not seem to be coordinating his/her efforts with the person who writes the text.  Maps list main streets, but not the ones where major hotels are located (except in the big cities).  Hence, you have no idea if your hotel is near or far away from major sites.  This is especially problematic for single travelers who might wish to favor a central location to minimize commute times and the troubles that accompany them.  Also, there is some inconsistency in the text.  A suggested &quot;ideal&quot; itinerary will exclude an item that is later listed in the text as a &quot;must see.&quot;  Perhaps the problem occurs when different reviewers provide updates for the guides and don't bother to read the existing text carefully.  Is the book worth your time? Yes, for the early stages of planning a trip.  But you will definitely need another guide for information that could easily have been provided here.  Finally, the guide subscribes to the PC nonsense that has become so popular lately....they soft peddle important things like SAFETY tips.  It's not being a wet rag to acknowledge that there are some serious safety concerns you must keep in mind....and spelling them out for each area.	2003-12-28

In addition, the author spends too much time on trivial matters while neglecting more important things.  For example, he writes page after page about Olmsted's failures to connect with a romantic mate.   Goodness, he wasn't much of looker or a lady schmoozer and this plagued him for years.  There, I said it in one sentence.  Had the author done likewise we might have learned more about the details of some of Olmsted's projects.   If the author wanted to play up relationships to give the reader a fuller appreciation of Olmsted's psychological make-up, he would have done better to delve deeper into the parent-child relationship.	2002-06-27

I've told many that you cannot convey the feeling of this place in photos, but Brukoff proves that you can.  His photos made me feel as though I was back there, discovering the majesty of the site and indulging in a leisurely and personal exploration of the details that delighted me during my visit, details that those on quick tourist jaunts usually miss.  Visually, this book is five stars.  Neruda's poetry, however, missed the mark for me.   An earlier reviewer picked out the best of it and included those lines in his review (see below).  I only wish it all worked that well.

Polidori takes on the last of these and does a beautiful job of showing splendor glimpsed through weary eyes - dilapidated buildings that beg to be honored again after many years of noble, yet thankless service; vintage autos standing like senile guards before crumbling facades; paint deprived, yet elegant interiors that suggest any number of richly layered stories.  It's all here.  And it makes you both nostalgic and hopeful.   How often can you stand on a seam of history, seeing the past, the present and a possible future all at once?  Then why not five stars?  Polidori spends a bit too much time in each location.  I don't really need to see every room in someone's house to get a feel for it....especially if that means there will be other locations that I don't get to see at all.  Public places are presented on the sidelines (by design), but I don't believe that that was the best strategy.  Public places are more than mere architecuture - they too have stories to tell, moods to convey, dreams to share.

US	52897783	R159A9A0TTEJA0	0880016361	240274265	Man Flies	Books	4	3	3	N	N	delightful little confection	Like the previous reviewer, I agree that the writing is simple and there is a lack of depth in the presentation.  However, unlike the previous reviewer, I don't believe that that spoils the project.  This little volume was meant as a general intro to a subject with many chapters and even more footnotes.  For readers with just a passing interest, this will be sufficient information.  For others, it will whet their appetites (a short bibliography is included).  Either way, there is no denying that this little book is very handsomely produced and a delight to behold.  The many vintage photos and illustrations are outstanding - they compensate nicely for the sparse text .  If you only read books found in univeristy libraries, this project will probably disappoint.  But if you like smartly produced picture books and the story of early flight is of interest to you, you will be happy to have Ms Winter's work.  At a mere 5 in. X 8 in., this little volume travels well, too.	2001-09-09
US	52897783	RFU54JER2QQWN	0312206801	2132954	The Venice Adriana	Books	3	1	2	N	N	some high points, but not enough	The author has some worthwhile ideas and he shows he can flesh them out creatively, but too often, he stoops to safe, formulaic writing (of course, that's probably what got him published). For example, anyone who has ever tried to track down a rare (bootleg) opera recording knows the games, the frustrations, and the usual disappointment that accompanies such folly. Mordden conveys this very accurately and engagingly in the book, but then he anchors this splendid story line to several others that are pure 'drugstore novel' in concept and delivery. Again and again, the work is most absorbing when the author seems least aware of the need to be tidy and follow the 'rules' of modern gay lit. The end result is that the most memorable characters and situations are the peripheral ones. I'd like to see him loosen up and try something more experimental.	2001-09-09

Mostly, I was taken with the pieces that go beyond slithy tovedom and settle into recognizable social commentary.  For example, The Miracle Man mocks the arrogance of physicians with a sharp yet not quite piercing tongue (and after surviving my HMO I found it delicious).  The Customs of Bombagarh takes on royalty, while The Pursuit of Science tackles psychiatrists with the same spirit.  Finally, the very funny Super Beast can be used to help children build self esteem (simply change the last two lines to: &quot;Not shoe nor a sunshade, I'll have to be me!&quot;)  Warning: it is impossible not to read aloud from this book.  Make sure someone else is home when you do it or the neighbors will talk.	2001-09-09

Well, the only thing silly was my premature judgment .  This is a beautiful volume that showcases some of the most awe inspiring trees to grace the countryside of Great Britain.  The photographer smartly captures the best of 60 chosen specimens, often including a human or two in the picture so the reader can grasp the magnificent size of these green giants.  Pictures tend slightly toward the overexposed end of the spectrum so that maximum detail can be discerned.  Each photo is accompanied by a brief, but informative description that makes each 'meeting' more meaningful.  The only disappoinment was that not enough data was provided for those inclined to go visit these remarkable trees in person.	2001-09-08

Some of it may be familiar to readers only casually acquainted with Chinese art, but most of it will not. In fact, even gallery goats are likely to find much new material. They have included the hanging scrolls (Zoon) of Huang Chih-Yang, the rouged, flower biting comrade by Li Shan, Fang Lijun's rage against conformity (the Chinese version of Munch's Howl), and Zhang Yu's elegant meditation. They have also selected pieces that look like rock album covers from the sixties, several more that express current turbulant feelings about Mao and his legacy, and many others that show this developing nation is growing up quickly...perhaps too quickly for its own psychic good. There are several essays to provide background and cultural context, but frankly, they're a bit lengthy and repetitive. This collection is certainly worth a look, but for every piece likely to raise an eyebrow and draw you in, there will be two that are quite forgettable.	2001-09-08

Unfortunately, the editors couldn't decide if they wanted to present an historical review or a collection that holds up to today's standards and expectations. Some of the stories are true winners, capable of delighting contemporary audiences as much as they did the original readers. Some stories, however, are seriously dated...not just in setting, but in mindset and perspective. While it is possible to ask respect for those pieces from an historical point of view, it is harder to claim that they make for compelling reading today.	2001-09-08

The photographs and illustrations are first rate - angles, cropping, detail enhancement, color/lighting - all are superbly produced and intelligently presented. In addition, there is plenty of helpful information (locations, hours, tips ). History/background is brief, but as expected in a general survey guide. The heavier, art quality pages add a bit to the weight (approx 1.4 lbs), but it is definitely worth it, given the volume's beauty and durability. For any trip to Venice and the surrounding area, this is one of two essential books (Venice for Pleasure, is the other).	2001-09-08

Taher tackles age old issues (revenge,  redemption) with a kind of freshness that helps the reader see something new.  He also gently leads the reader to adopt the appropriate cultural mindset so that the characters can be held close to the heart, not merely observed from afar.  Sometimes, however, his writing is weighed down by awkward or repetitive descriptions . Since this is a translation, it is difficult to tell if the problem is the author's or the translator's.  Anyway, it is not excessive and can be overlooked by the reader willing to forgive a little to get a lot.	2001-09-08

Sloppy and over-emotional thinking, he claims, is ugly in any arena, but it is especially ugly at universities, government agencies, and in the press. Good science, accompanied by well reasoned and tempered pronouncements should be the norm. (Of course, under-responsiveness at the bidding of big business or as a characterological flaw - or lab fatigue - is no bargain either.) But the author does not suggest that it is. Still, his axe grinding forces him to lean heavily in one direction and at times, I wished that he had paid more attention to balance. Certainly, this is true of his tone. I understand that he must be frustrated with the relentless hysteria, but becoming too sour is no solution (&quot;the mealy mouthed expression of health educationists;&quot; &quot;obviously, further research is called for - funded, of course by the taxpayer&quot;). If his goal is to win converts to the cause of reason and temperance, he must model that as well as champion it.	2001-09-08

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	excellent information, but at times too PC	Cramer provides excellent information for anyone traveling to Bolivia who wishes to make his visit more than a postcard stop. From festivals to daily activities, he guides the reader over the true Bolivian landscape (real and psychological). His tips are straight forward and will address most questions or concerns the reader might have. My only complaint is his need to be so PC. Every culture has wonderful and less wonderful things. I think it shows true respect for a culture to be able to proudly display its strengths and honestly discuss what 'stinks.' Arrogance in the Bolivian professional world that forces the 'unconnected' to be treated dismissively is not just an opportunity for the disenfranchised to learn patience. It is a flaw in that culture...just as it is in any culture where it occurs (there, I've said it and the PC God didn't strike me dead!) Having said that, I must admit that Cramer does not sugar coat everything. Also, my complaint is a minor one in light of everything that he does well.	2001-09-08

The language is simple and the sense of nostalgia it conjures is rich and complex, but it is never tinged by the scent of spilled beer - rather, crushed flowers.  This is a dreamy tale with a core of sadness.  Read it aloud to someone and notice how your appreciation of the story grows.	2001-09-08

When the writing works (reflections on his meanderings across a physical and psychological  landscape), it is wildly successful.  Some sections had me gushing appreciation for the author's insights and masterly descriptions.  Other sections, however, made me wish that a good editor had stepped in to remind the author that he was, ultimately, writing for an audience beyond the mirror.	2001-09-08

Captured and forced to work as their navigator, Aaron walks the reader through his daily activities and the many thoughts and feelings that he experienced during his ordeal. His observations, internal and external, are keen. His descriptions seem winningly quaint, the way only true historical writing can. He also provokes the willing reader to examine a very uncomfortable and 'timeless' truth: if a captive does not placate his criminal tormentors, he will be killed; if he placates them too much, he may be identified with them and tried as an accomplice when rescued (apprehended?)   Mr Smith takes us to scary places in both his world and ours.	2001-09-08

The authors detail the sagas (and they often are) of individuals who owned strategically located bits of real estate and refused to sell their property to land developers eager to consume them in major projects. Sometimes you root for the holdout, sometimes you feel sorry for the misguided rebel. The writing can become a bit petulant when the authors fail to see the holdout's point of view (for at least one author progress is always on the side of the Donald Trumps of the world), but ultimately enough information is given to allow the reader to decide who was the wisest player in a particular scenario. This book also provides a look at 'New York buildings that aren't there anymore.'	2001-09-08

By using modern language and references when possible, Mr Matthews has shown the timelessness of Martial's epigrams. Where Martial addresses a man who buried seven wives, Matthews offers: &quot;Sow the body, reap the estate: isn't agriculture grand?&quot; This could be the lead story in tomorrow's paper.

Sometimes, however, he has trouble editing and the emotional impact of the work becomes diminished, the reader suddenly feels distant from the characters (even if charmed by the writing exercise itself). When he learns to handle his embarrassment of riches better (a stream of worthy ideas and endless beguiling descriptions), he will produce a more engaging novel. It would also help if he made his romantic scenes a little less cartoonish.	2001-09-06

Head directly for the strongest part of this project, the middle section (BOOK TWO) which contains a series of four linked stories. They probe a complex and unsettled relationship between father and son. The characters are richly drawn and embodied with as many attributes as flaws, so you never give up on them. Of course, the flaws are profound. But then, the emphasis on closure and redemption wouldn't be as compelling if they weren't. A fine read that would have received more attention if he'd lead with his best writing and titled the book more appropriately.	2001-09-05

Some reviewers may be upset that her stories are consistently dark and her characters tend to overly internalize things....it doesn't match their perception of how kids are today .  But I would suggest that while today's kids are more juiced up and likely to act out  feelings (versus internalize), it doesn't negate what's deep down and driving the pseudo-empowered behavior that makes news headlines.  See Alice Miller.   Then re-read Beth.	2001-06-14

For example, we are told that above Orta San Giulio there are several fetching towns and attractions but we are not told how far they are or how to get there.  Is a car required?  Any public transportation?  Is the sanctuary a pleasant 2 mile walk or a challenging 7 mile hike?  Perhaps if you are making a return visit such details are not necessary, but for the first time visitor they are essential.  Also, anyone planning to visit this area will most likely include both Mantua and Verona on their visit, but only Mantua is covered here.  (Yes, Verona is not technically included in the 'Lombard Plain,' but can you imagine a guide to LA that didn't include Disneyland because technically it's in Anaheim, not LA?) You'll need another guide for Verona.  If the authors issue a revised edition including Verona plus more detailed info, this will be an excellent guide.  Mr Pauls, can we hope for this?	2001-03-24

Lesser writers become pedantic or trivialize weighty issues to make the read a smoother one. This author, however, remains unflinchingly on mark while rendering engaging characters and  beautiful descriptions (I found myself reading certain paragraphs aloud just for the pleasure of it).  Yes, in places it's a bit overwritten...a good editor should have stepped in... but it's forgiveable in light of the many strengths.  Important reading - you'll want this in your library for the next generation as well.	2001-03-18
