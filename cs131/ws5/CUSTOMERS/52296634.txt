A Novel of Discworld	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Good, but not quite among Prachett's Best	Thud!, like many of Pratchett's books is a mystery, a comedy, and a commentary on modern society. Here, Prachett returns to some of the themes of _Fifth Elephant_ when he explores issues of dwarven tradition, resistance to modernization, and fanaticism. There are clear echoes of Marching Season in Northern Ireland, and of integration of ethnic minorities in English cities. <br /> <br />(As an aside, this may be the first novel that does not mention the Disc, or Discworld, itself.) <br /> <br />The Watch are among my favorite characters and it is good to see Carrot, Angua, Colon, Nobbie, and Detritus all get some time in the spotlight. Sadly, Colon and Nobbie are underused -- they are assigned to an art theft early in the book, but that plot element then vanishes for several chapters before reappearing. A new member, a vampire, is added to the watch -- she gets some very good scenes with Angua, but I found myself wishing for a bit more about her and the other members of the Watch. <br /> <br />The book's weaknesses, here as in _Monsterous Regiment_ arise in the resolution. Vimes does not act as much as he is acted upon. Characters who know more about what is going on, and have every reason to want Vimes to know more, are obstinately mysterious. It feels like there is a radical change towards the last quarter of the book -- as if it were building to some other resolution, then Prachatt changed his mind. The resolution seems to go on too long, and is followed by a long post-script, which is likely a set-up for an element of the next novel (for a hint, pay particular attention to the mine-signs, then think about their London counterparts). <br /> <br />All in all, better than _Monsterous Regiment_, but not quite among the best novels, such as _Night Watch_. Certainly worth one's time and attention	2005-09-17

Having seen the movie in previews, I strongly urge folks to see the movie cold -- DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FIRST. There are a number of moments you do not want to be spoiled for. <br /> <br />After you see the movie, tho, read this book. <br /> <br />For those readers who have never heard of Firefly or Serenity, this is the novel of a movie that should not exist. Firefly started as a TV series (now in DVDs). It was cancelled in its first season. Hollywood does not make movies from failed TV shows. Until now. <br /> <br />Serenity, the novel, stands alone. You can start here, knowing nothing else about the universe. DeCandido does more than just summarize the movie, he ties together elements from the TV series and the bridging comic book. Newcomers to the setting will understand a bit more about who these characters are, how and why they fit together, and the significance of the movie's events. Fans will appreciate a chance to hear internal monologues form the characters, including River and Jayne, and the backstory of some of the new characters. <br /> <br />DeCandio adds in some material, likely from deleted scenes, which helps fill in a few of the gaps in the movie plot, including a few tidbits about Book. Among other tidbits, he gives the reader Book's first name and the full names of the characters who hadn't been fully named in the series. <br /> <br />Read the book, but only after you see the movie.	2005-09-04

The dialog and sense of place are first rate -- and should be as the author is writing from experience. <br /> <br />The problem is with the plot and pacing. As a work of fiction, it doesn't build well to climax. There's several possible climax scenes -- does the big score work, do our heros confront Mary Fallon, are they caught by the feds, does Jack abandon his life of crime for his girl? None of these come together smoothly for a novel. <br /> <br />It feels like Boyos had not decided whether it was semi-autobiographical -- essentially non-fiction with names changed to protect real people; or a work of fiction which should follow a novel's plot structure. And that indecision weakens the story. <br /> <br />Read the book for a sense of characters you might meet on the South Boston strees and for the sense of place. Experienced mystery readers will see the plot twists coming chapters away. Other readers may feel some anti-climax in the resolution.	2005-07-05

The setting is modern suburbia, but demons exist and can possess the recently deceased or those willing to ally with them. Our heroine is a retired demon hunter, pulled out of her suburban life to fight a powerful foe. <br /> <br />The _Buffy_ influences are evident, but well handled. It is \\"horror\\", in the sense of including demons, but there are no graphic descriptions of death, injuries, or foul evil. There is some mention of sex between the married protagonist and her husband, which is discretely handled). The fight scenes are brief. The book is suitable for, tho perhaps not interesting to, a teenage reader. <br /> <br />For the experienced mystery reader, the puzzle, clues, and red-herrings will be obvious too soon. This reader found herself impatiently waiting for Kate to figure out the problem at several points. <br /> <br />I found the the setting and the situations a bit too akin to Buffy and the underlying puzzle weak. I'd recommend it as beach reading from the library or used book bin, but not at full price.	2005-07-05

The book did inspire me to want to re-watch the episode, Court Martial, two of the characters are based on. <br /> <br />The book follows a classic cozy format -- set up a closed world of a frontier colony, give several characters motive to want to kill the victim, and turn the detective loose to ferrit out their secrets. Unfortunately, the cozy style depends on characterization, and on good interplay between the detective and the suspects. Here, the interplay seems forced and dull. I had hopes of a good Christie-style twist in the unmasking, but was disappointed. The reader may be better served reading some of Gardner's better Perry Mason novels, Christie's better works, or some Rumpole of the Bailey stories. <br /> <br />The authors ostentatiously display their mastery of Trek triva, working in references to dozens of TOS, NextGen, and ST:Enterprise worlds, people, and events. The book itself is sandwiched between Return of the Archons and Trouble with Tribbles in the ToS timeline. The triva references swiftly become grating. And the authors don't wrestle with problems in the canon, like the truth-detector used in some ToS episodes. <br /> <br />The courtroom scenes could have benefited from more consultation with a practicing attorney. Gardner was a lawyer, and knew what corners he was cutting with Perry's courtroom theatrics. Here, the authors don't take liberties with the coutroom aspects, but in a way that doesn't seem credible. Shaw's loss if pre-ordained, but one doesn't get the sense of her preparations, and Cogley having to overcome an experienced opponent. <br /> <br />All in all, an average mystery in an interesting setting. A sequel, perhaps by other authors, could be fascinating.	2005-06-18
US	52296634	R1Z91KRIK937M5	097009731X	789350261	Over the Edge:  Death in Grand Canyon	Books	3	13	20	N	N	Comprehensive, but flawed overview	The first half of this book is a fine discussion of overly ambitious  photographers, hikers, swimmers, boaters, and flyers. <br /> <br />At the point that the text begins to discuss guided boat trips and flying accidents, it becomes less useful. The authors note the importance of propert training, staffing, and equipment on guided trips and discuss the loopholes in various regulations that may impair safety. The book could have been more helpful if it had provided some clear guidance (perhaps a summary or checklist) for tourists about researching boating and air trips to avoid the least safe companies. <br /> <br />The section on an armed panhandler living three miles into the Canyon raised some questions about violent crime in and around the Canyon and whether the NPS policies prohibiting self-defense weapons in the Parks are a wise idea. If 4 armed park rangers had trouble with one armed man, what risks exist for solo or small groups of hikers? The following section on a kidnapper in the park raised similar concerns. Statistics on non-fatal assaults, robberies, and sexual assaults on hikers inside the Canyon would have been an interesting addition to this chapter. <br /> <br />This is not an academic analysis, but the authors at times seem unaware of the problems of witness' perceptions and memory. A subsequent volume might want to look into some of the research in this area and add a few more qualifiers when relying on anecdotal data. <br /> <br />The weakest part of the book is the epilogue where the authors move from a solid analysis based on recorded incidents into a discussion of the sociology of adventure tourism and a diatribe against tort lawyers and irresponsible juries. The authors assert, without providing any supporting data, that frivolous lawsuits are costing National Park Service resources and impose irksome restrictions on responsible travelers. Without any supporting data, this rant feels tacked on by the authors and signficantly diminishes the solid feeling of the rest of the book. (Those 4 pages cost the book a star in this reviewer's eyes.)	2005-05-01

It is a well-written biography of an important figure in biology. Alexander was not merely the patron of two natural history museums at U.Cal Berkeley, she and her partner collected thousands of animal, plant, and fossil specimens for it over the course of decades. <br /> <br />Worth reading for a portrait of turn-of-the-century collecting, science, and the role of an extraordinary woman at that time. <br /> <br />The text does meander a bit at times in the time periods discussed in each chapter and it could use a few more maps, but it is otherwise well researched and well-written.	2005-05-01

It is, essentially, a Criminal Defense for Dummies for the novice (or experienced) lawyer covering everything outside of the actual courtroom. Topics include going to the police station (discovery issues, what's in a typical police file), disclosures from the prosecutor (what's required, what to ask for, what to do when you don't get something), mandatory disclosures to the prosecutor (different in the UK from the US, but quite interesting), how to analyze statements to for discovery and cross-exam purposes, how to interview witnesses (yours, the prosecutor's, and alibi witnesses), and lots of other useful topics. About a third of the book is specific to UK readers and of limited use here -- the rest has a series of valuable insights for attorneys and attorney-trainers. <br /> <br />Worth reading, tho hard to find and a bit expensive to import.	2005-02-27

It isn't a whodunnit, more a howcatchhim book. Hemry does a fine job with the naval atmosphere and setting. <br /> <br />The two things keeping this from a 5 star review are: <br />the exposition is a bit clunky in places -- the exposition doesn't flow smoothly from the characters, it is there to make sure the reader is keeping up. This can be a persistent problem both in the SF genre and in legal stories. <br /> <br />the antagonist seems to lack any redeeming features. It is fairly clear who the antagonist will be within pages of his appearance in the story. It would have been nice to see some redeeming features to flesh him out as a 3D person. As it is, even the people who liked him are doubting their judgment by the end.	2005-01-26

Harvard professor Hugo Musterberg's first book on the subject written in 1908 prompted a vigorous backlash from Dean John Henry Wigmore, author of the widely used treatise on evidence. Since then, Musterberg and Wigmore's successors have struggled over the place of psychological research on perception and memory in the courtroom. Doyle's book traces that struggle, focusing on the major personalities, and on the cases of the wrongfully convicted. The primary focus is the psychologists, but jurists, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, and politicians are all included. <br /> <br />Primarily useful as a history and discussion of policy. The 10 pages of endnotes are an excellent guide for readers interested in futher details.	2005-01-14

Take the stars with that grain of salt. <br /> <br />Cops is about portraying a police officer, detective, or federal agent in a role-playing game setting. The tone is dramatic (think NYPD Blue or Alien Nation), but cinematic play (Lethal Weapon, Supercop) is possible too. <br /> <br />Chapters include: <br /> <br />A short history of policing and police duties <br /> <br />Campaign set-up, departments, sample police agencies (US, UK, Japan, Soviet model), types of officers and agents, and adventure ideas. <br /> <br />Character templates, equipment, and notes on adapting GURPS to a police adventure or campaign. <br /> <br />Typical adversaries, crimes, and other adventure ideas. <br /> <br />A guide to solving crimes including basic crime scene investigation, interviews, and interrogations. <br /> <br />A guide to trials in an RPG context, also a quick guide to doing time, jailbreaks, and extradition. <br /> <br />Four densely packed pages of sources and recommended reading/viewing. <br /> <br />Cops was published in December, 2001. It was in final editing on 9/11 and does not address the significant changes in policing caused by the war on terror, the Patriot Act, and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. <br /> <br />The book is designed as an RPG supplement, but may also be useful to writers and those interested in police and crimes.	2005-01-12

The authors' thesis is that triers of fact reach their decisions based on two judgments: (1) an assessment of the plausibility of the prosecutor's account of the events and motives and (2) whether this narrative can be anchored by evidence to common-sense beliefs generally accepted as true most of the time. <br />     The authors first discuss their theories of judicial and jury reasoning, focusing on how evidence is anchored to beliefs. They then turn to a discussion of police investigations, noting a <br />distinction between offense-driven and suspect-driven searches - in the former the police begin with a crime scene and are search for the culprit; in the latter, the police attempt to link a suspect to an unsolved offense. In the former, the investigators collect evidence until it logically excludes everyone but the culprit. In the latter, the authors note that one needs only enough information to make the suspect look guilty. The problem with the latter is tunnel vision, confirmation bias, and officers willing to fabricate evidence against a suspect they are certain is guilty. The authors also discuss the difference between  verification vs. falsification in the context of confessions, alibis, and other evidence. <br />     Later chapters discuss confession evidence and the problem of forced or false confessions; identification procedures; eyewitness testimony (contrasting mistaken witnesses with lying witnesses); and expert testimony. The authors suggest defense tactics to combat the assumptions and heuristics (reasoning shortcuts) often used by judges and juries and finally suggest ten universal evidentiary rules and procedures to improve the information available for fact-finders. <br />     The text has internal citations instead of footnotes or endnotes. All of the referenced works are listed in five pages at the end.As a resource, the book may provide the reader with a number of good ideas for approaching legal analysis. Readers should be aware that the text is over ten years old - there has been a great deal of research, particularly in the fields of false confession and eyewitness identification in the intervening time.	2005-01-10

Stark's book focuses on the lives of prostitutes in English port towns, on sailor's wives and widows ashore, and those who sailed with their husbands, and briefly on the experiences of women who sailed disguised as men.<br /><br />The author does a good job of portraying the limited options available to English women during the Napoleonic era, and explains why women might find it necessary to engage in prostitution, follow their husbands to sea, or serve disguised as men. The author takes pain to debunk the then-popular myth of disguised women sailors searching for lost husbands or brothers.<br /><br />The book was, in some respects, too brief a discussion of the topic. A more in-depth analysis would be welcome.	2005-01-10

Anyone actually attempting to use this book for reference or for practical purposes should take those two disclamers to heart. <br /> <br />Readers should also note the copyright date (now 12 years old) and note the significant changes in criminal procedure and practices in the past decade. Tests that were too expensive for a routine investigation in 1992 are often cheaper, easier, and much more common now. <br /> <br />Some of the advice is likely to increase a prospective reader's chances of getting caught. Very useful generic advice, such as never waiving one's Miranda rights or consenting to a search are not even mentioned. As a reference work, it utterly lacks any footnotes, endnotes, or even recommended reading or indication of the author's creditials in crime scene investigation.	2004-12-27

If more people followed this advice, criminal defense attorneys would have much easier jobs.<br />As noted in several places, the book does not substitute for the advice of an attorney, it is merely legal first aid to prevent fatal mistakes before the attorney arrives.<br />I would disagree with the authors on some minor details, but not on the critical details. I would likely even more strongly warn against representing oneself (p.175) in any but the most minor cases. I would also note that co-counsel or advisory counsel to a defendant representing himself is often very limited and the defendant needs to understand those limits before waiving counsel.<br />In sum, well worth reading.	2004-06-14

Her suggestions for race-switching jury instructions raise questions about the reader's own biases and assumptions.<br />The problem comes in Lee's understanding of use-of-force issues especially issues relating to reaction times (which can result in shots to the side or back), stress hormones and memory (which can result in fragmented memory), stress hormones and fine muscle control (which makes it hard to practically shoot to wound), and the ability of handgun fire to penetrate standard building materials (which makes warning shots dangerous).

Cox's book fits into that pattern. Nothing challenging, but worth the read.<br />Geeks will enjoy spotting the plethora of Star Trek, comics, tv show, and movie homages scattered through the book. I suspect I didn't get more that 60% of what's there.<br />On the downside -- the author wears his politics on his sleeve, especially when dealing with one of Khan's brethern, a paranoid American who creates a militia &quot;cult&quot;. While a distaste for conservate politics and for law-abiding firearms owners is likely good Trek-politics, the book takes gratiutious slams by lumping all firearms owners in with a few over-the-top folks. This is especially grating when Gary Seven gives a speech about trusting to ordinary human ability and judgment and the risk of folks who think that because of their DNA they are &quot;better&quot; than others. The same should apply to those who think that just because they are alien-spy-agents they are more responsible with firearms than average folks.<br />Some of the global political material was also shallow, but one should go not to Trek books for deep thinking on current events.<br />I would have liked it better with less modern politics and more allegory.	2003-06-12

As such, it is best suited for Christie readers who have already read those works, or who do not mind having surprises revealed.<br />Otherwise, Bayard provides a good analysis of how Christie fools her readers, pulling back the curtain to reveal the magician's secrets. His taxonimy of the tricks is useful, although incomplete. This makes it a good guide for an aspiring mystery writer looking to see how Christie worked her magic.<br />Bayard's psychoanalysis of the crime is a bit more speculative. One can nit-pick his facts and conclusions, but the exercise is itself useful. Appling critical analysis to Christie's solution seems no less absurd than Tey's re-analysis of Richard III in Daughter of Time, the endless books on Jack the Ripper's identity, or decades of English literature classes convinced that the author is the last person to understand the significance of his own works.<br />In sum, worth reading for those who enjoy learning about the tricks of the mystery writing trade.	2003-05-12

I finished NiC in a day.<br />Good Points:<br />The were-relationships and Anita's realization that cooperation instead of in-fighting is the solution.<br />Richard's characterization and weaknesses are consistent, if frustrating.<br />Bad Points:<br />The bulk of the book is about Anita's sexual woes as a result of more tightly bonding with Jean Claude and Richard -- it seems that Jean Claude's incubus is contageous, you see. . . . And the sexual scenes mean Anita leaves Nathanial and Gregory in considerable danger while she has sex. Not the Blake I prefer.<br />There's a plot under there somewhere, trying despirately to come out -- why Nathanial and Gregory are threatened in the first place, for example -- which Anita totally ignores while in the midst of her sexual adventures. As it stands, the plot is basically a thread between sex scenes - like a bad porn movie.<br />Too many new characters. You'll probably need a score card to recall who's who, who's sleeping with who, and why you should care about the casualties of various fights.<br />Too many loose ends and minor digressions. The subplot with Belle Morte, for example, seems to be foreshadowing for the next book - and could have been much shorter.<br />I second the folks who say this series badly needs better editing. There are some clever ideas here. An interesting universe. But less sex, more plot!	2001-12-01

Readers interested in Church history and the development of Catholic and Protestant theology will find useful insights. Historical heresies also have a surprising resonance with modern charismatic cults.<BR>     To cover the vast array of major heretical movements over several centuries, the book assumes a basic grounding in medieval history and culture. It is readable without such a grounding, but may be more confusing.<BR>      A short glossary of heretics is provided. A timeline of major events would have been useful.	2001-11-16

He tells the story of his representation well.<br />When it comes to making his case about why McVeigh could not have acted alone, however, I was gravely disappointed. The book lacks a good index, footnotes, endnotes, dates, people, places, copies of reports, and other information vital to anyone truely interested in the case who is not willing to just take Mr. Jones word for what he saw, learned, and believes. It quotes infrequently from some documents and tapes, but those points are far too few and far between.<br />As an book advocating his point, it falls short of what one would expect from experienced counsel who had been prepared to argue these very issues in court and presumably has references to all the 302s, photos, auditotapes, depositions, transcripts, and reports near to hand. Documents that are classified could easily have been identified at least as to date and source so they could be referenced by later researches if and when they are unclassified -- the author seems willing to quote from sealed records, why not make his audiotapes and correspondence public now that McVeigh is deceased.	2001-07-16

As previous reviewers have noted, it is indeed introspective. But it is not so self-referential that a novice cannot pick up the details of the characters and their complex interrelationship.<br />My only qualms were what seemed like a deus-ex-machina at the end which saved one character from otherwise certain death. Figuring out the plot twist about the cause of Kay's woes a tape and a half from the end. A nagging urge to want to strangle some of the more evasive characters who Kay muses are hiding things from her but from whom she does not demand clear answers.<br />The forensic and investigative details had a good feel of verisimilitude. As a criminal defense attorney, my only caution to readers is that this kind of careful detective and forensic work is not often seen in routine cases. The castigated James City County detective is closer to the norm that our heroine and her inner circle.	2001-01-22

I hear echoes of Abner Loueema and Rodney King in Feinberg's description of Jesse's encounters with the police and inability to even seek routine medical care.	2000-12-26
US	52296634	R2OKOGADRSKRNO	0440235383	484158903	Back to the Moon	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Disappointing Novel by Good Non-Fiction Author	Having read Hickam's autobiography and book on WWII submarine warfare, I was looking forward to this novel. I found it a compelling thriller, which does not stand up to morning-after thought.      The novel feels like a Walter Mitty/Mary Sue wish fulfillment book. The heros are good, right-thinking folks who are trying to help the world. The villians are, for the most part, a stock conspiracy of greedy industrialists. As various adversaries hired by the the adversaries talk to our heros and learn of their selfless plan, they convert to helping our heros. And in the end, the world becomes a more utopian place.     I thought Hickam could write a more compelling, deeper novel about a subject obviously dear to his heart. October Sky showed gave a nuanced picture of his childhood adversaries. The villians seem very cardboard.      Like a Grisham novel, I found it hard to put down with a disappointing aftertaste.	2000-10-24
