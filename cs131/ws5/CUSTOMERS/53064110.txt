But I had trouble getting into this one. I never really connected with any of the characters, except Tanuki, the mythical dog-badger, who is missing from the bulk of the story. The plot never engaged me. The ending - what exactly happened in the ending? I dunno, even after three re-reads. Even Robbins' patented loopy writing style seemed rather not up-to-snuff this time. I'll reiterate what others have said: If this is the first Robbins you've set your hands on, put it aside and go for Jitterbug Perfume or Skinny Legs and All. Don't start with this one. If you're a veteran, you're probably not even reading this review. You're probably out buying it, and you'll soon be writing a review similar to this one (and the other reviews that this one echoes).	2003-07-28

It's a fun, sometimes gruesome, tale featuring eco-vandalism, anger management, true love, political lobbying, safari hunting, 911 tapes, Barbie dolls, littering, and more. Each character is more sleazy, disturbed, dirty, or otherwise fascinating than the last.<br />The sick puppy of the title is a big black lab named McGuinn (or is it Boodle?), who has major plot impact. Or is the sick puppy the litterbug sleazeball lobbyist? Or maybe it's the porcupine-haired hit man? No, it's got to be the Barbie-loving developer. Or maybe the red-glass-eye-wearing Everglades-dwelling ex-governor. Or... you get the idea. Even the good guys aren't folks you'd want to have over for the weekend. (In fact, the only truly nice characters are the women.)<br />The whole story is told with an &quot;it could only happen in Florida&quot; tone, which makes me want to read more Hiaasen (and Dave Barry). It was also my first eco-fiction read, which makes me want to read others, including TC Boyle's &quot;A Friend of the Earth.&quot;	2003-04-28

I feel I need to say that right off the bat since the title, &quot;The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity,&quot; as wordy as it is, doesn't say that. In the preface Cooper explains that the purpose of the book is to make a business case for Interaction Design. Therefore he wrote a book for managers. It's full of wacky metaphors not only in the title, but throughout the book. (Add this to the list of oddly-titled business and management book titles: Who Moved My Cheese? Crossing the Chasm, Swim With the Sharks, and so forth.)<br />I'm not a manager, so I can't say whether this book succeeds in making a persuasive business case for Interaction Design. It was heartening to see validation for my area of expertise in black and white. This is not a book for software engineers to read, though, as Cooper seems to have a real problem with programmers. Where Don Norman blamed bad design on designers in The Psychology of Everyday Things, here Cooper places the blame for bad software products directly on programmers.<br />An Interaction Design book written for Interaction Designers would have included more details about how to create and use Personas and Scenarios (two of Cooper's design techniques), and perhaps some advice on how to gain control and respect on interactive projects. But we don't get that.<br />This isn't quite the book about Interaction Design that Interaction Designers need. It does introduce important ideas and techniques, and does describe, in some detail, the problem of programmer-driven products. But I didn't feel that the solutions were covered well enough.	2002-07-31

I asked how it was going, and she told me that she had skimmed through much of it since a lot of it was \\"air.\\" The Corrections has a lot of \\"air\\" in it too, but I wasn't smart enough to skim those parts. This is a long book - it reads to me like several novellas. Each story had several pages where I lost interest, then a good strong finish that made me say \\"wow.\\" It reminded me a bit of the Alan Parker film, Birdy, which seemed like a 90-minute setup to a single wonderful punchline (except Birdy lacked the long periods of thinking \\"why am I here?\\"). Within this structure we have the sad, funny, crude, stories of each member of the Lambert family. I'm left with one question: what is it about these people that make them urinate in tin cans so often?	2002-02-22

It's full of mind-bending metaphors and squishy similes, like you'd expect. It's a bit sloppy - immature, a more thoughtful reviewer might say. I wonder what he had been doing before writing this. Composing goofy-witty short stories? Collecting insane metaphors in stacks of spiral notebooks? Building up his mind with recreational drugs?<br />Though this book is nearly as fulfilling as anything you'll pick up, the ending was not as dramatically significant as expected. It built up nicely, but the final act didn't satisfy like I had hoped. Still, it's a book that will have you chuckling under your breath on the bus, and reading portions to your loved ones.	2001-11-14

It's a detailed look at testing, covering everything from test plans and lab construction to data analysis and how to handle unqualified testers who slip through the screening process. It covers lower-budget tests in addition to full-scale ones. It's clear that Dumas and Redish have loads of experience, and they're not shy about sharing it.<br />The most useful idea I came away with is that testing needs a specific purpose. You can't just test a system's usability; you test, for example, the navigation system or a membership form.<br />The only flaws here are a couple of omissions. There's no mention of testing web applications, though the principles covered here can be extrapolated to other purposes. And there is no mention of the ultra-cheap guerilla testing tactics. I doubt Dumas and Redish would approve of them, but it would have been very helpful to read about where these alternative methods were effective and not.<br />This book is a keeper. While my organization will not likely be doing full-blown usability testing for awhile, I'm now more able to evaluate and communicate with third-party testing facilities. And this book will influence all of our other evaluation and assessment testing methods.	2001-07-06

I grin a lot, occasionally snickering, sometimes fighting off snorts and laughter. That's not to say that a Robbins story is simply humorous; some of my pleasure is from sharing in the absolute joy that Robbins takes in putting his phrases on paper.<br />Fierce Invalids isn't his best - read Skinny Legs and All - but it's still a great read. It seemed to ramble at times, leaving our hero for many pages in places seemingly far, far away from where he ought to be. But it all comes around in the end, with (as expected in a Robbins story) events in opposite ends of the earth having tremendous influence on each other. Also, as expected, we're presented with some universal truths, not the least of which is the secret to true happiness, delivered from the beak of a parrot.<br />And finally, it's an intimidating thing to review a Robbins book. I find myself inspired to fill my review with Robbinsesque metaphors. I try, but I'm not nearly as enlightened as Mr. R. Maybe after reading his next book.	2001-04-11

The writing is beautiful, as expected in an Updike book. The recurring theme gets a little tiresome, though, with a few interesting exceptions. &quot;Scenes from the Fifties&quot; has a smile-inducing punch line. &quot;Licks of Love in the Heart of the Cold War's&quot; main character is an American banjo player, acting as &quot;cultural ambassador&quot; in USSR.<br />The highlight, though, as other reviewers have mentioned, is Rabbit Remembered. Through the Rabbit novels Harry's son, Nelson, held little interest for me, despite the closeness of our ages. But now he's grown up, cleaned up, filling the main-character role quite well. His half-sister arrives on the doorstep of his mother and step-father's house where he lives, sparking his further growth and cleansing. This is a lovely, necessary read for fans of the Rabbit series.	2001-02-23

This book confirms it for me. Moore's books are summer fare, where Robbins writes fall books (think of the summer vs. fall movie analogy). Having said that, Lust Lizard is a nice story about a man-eating lizard. There are a number of side-plots - too many, I think - involving depression, love, the blues, and drug dealing, all of which are tied up tightly by the last page. It's fun, but hollow and cluttered. I'll read more Moore, on vacation.	2000-12-05

But good lord, Jitterbug Perfume does it. This one's not as far over the top as his others, but is hilarious and warm at the same time. It's fun and insightful.<br />As with his other books, Robbins has a few things to teach us about the world. In this book we get the nature of beets, what zippers think about, we stop to ask a fox in the woods if he's seen which way our protagonists went, we follow an ancient god through the last several centuries of his life. All this and the secret of immortality to boot. And the whole shebang is written strangely enough, primarily from the olfactory sense, making sight and sound secondary.<br />The elegant ending is implied rather than explained: we know how it ends without actually witnessing it. A pleasing decision to end a pleasing book.	2000-10-26

Skeptical? So was I. But darned if they don't hit the ol' web design nail right on the ol' head. (Okay, they're not really librarians - but both authors come from a Library Science background.) When I started on my Interaction Design masters degree, there wasn't anything written sepcifically about it. So my education was based on other fields - architecture, rhetoric, psychology, graphic design. Now we're starting to see some good Interaction Design books coming from experts in those other fields.<br />The strength of this book is its emphasis on defining a navigable structure for a site. It covers structure, navigation, searching/browsing, and this is the first book I've seen that spends a whole chapter on button and link labelling systems. It's added labelling to my ID vocabulary.<br />I do agree with another reviewer who wanted more in-depth examples, but with enough web experience it's easy to come up with examples on our own. So I gave the book the fifth star.<br />This and Jennifer Fleming's Web Navigation (both O'Reilly books) are must-haves for web designers.	2000-10-16

I like what it's about: Galileo, his  daughter, his discoveries, 17th-century science, politics, society, the  church, the Inquisition, the Plague, geography, and more.<br />I like Sobel's  style. Warm, with an impressive level of detail. It's apparent that she's  done exhaustive research, and it's clear that she cares deeply about her  subject.<br />I like the unpretentious way that Galileo's time is contrasted  with our own. Galileo sequestered his illegitimate daughter in a convent,  yet there was genuine love between them. We see how the good of the  individual was second to the good of society, both in Maria Celeste's  acceptance of her tough circumstances, and in Galileo's dealings with the  Inquisition. We see how the rules of nature were based more on what made  logical sense than on observation (which led to, for example, some bizarre  medical treatments).<br />Even though I don't read much biography, I found  this to be a fascinating, engaging book, meticulously researched and  powerfully written, with a satisfying stranger-than-fiction ending.	2000-08-30

This book is sort of a Robbins-Lite. We've got an enjoyable puree of natural and  supernatural, without Robbins' mastery of the metaphor. Now, Moore's  writing is clever and funny, but Robbins' makes me smile at least once per  page.<br />In Coyote Blue we get a man facing up to his past (at the  insistence of an ancient Native American god) and falling in real love for  the first time. The best bits were the Native American myths told from a  20th Century point of view. The worst bits came at the end of the book. I  won't give it away, but I will say that it's too much deus ex machina, even  for a book about gods. Everything up to that point had made sense in its  own way, but this was too much.<br />I will read more Moore, but I won't  expect brilliance - just fun.	2000-08-01

It is a timeless human story, examining realities, not romantic fantasies. The conflicts in the  drama are the same conflicts we all deal with - those of ordinary  relationships. This is a book about friendships and marriages, and what  regular folks do to survive them. The reader becomes the fifth friend,  forced (sniffling) to say goodbye to the other four on the last page. After  finishing Crossing to Safety, I didn't want to read anything else for a  couple weeks.	2000-06-28

This is the story of Frank Bascombe's transition from his Existence Period to his Permanent Period, neither term I entirely understand, even after 450 pages.<br />An interesting, life-like aspect of Frank is that he seems to be  a different person in his life than when he's narrating the story. As  Frank's hot-dog vendor employee says, &quot;Frank, you seem one way and are  another.&quot; And so we all are. Frank's not the most likable guy in the  world, but he's real, with real, believable concerns about his life.<br />The  book just didn't click with me. Maybe I'm too young at 37 to understand the  Existence Period, maybe I just wanted something (anything!) to happen. So  though I liked the book's style (similar to a favorite author, John  Updike), I'm still left unsatisfied.	2000-06-15

We see the 20th century through the eyes of a series of underpriviledged, bigoted people who each come in contact with a green accordian (this is nothing like The Red Violin). Nobody lives well or dies  happy. The structure of the book gives us at most a couple chapters on a  character, so we don't end up caring very much about anybody. Yet Proulx's  style is engaging, and early in the book she tosses a plot element into the  mix that keeps you going to the satisfying end (which was good enough to  turn a 2-star rating into a 3-star).	2000-06-15

Who knows? I'm guessing that the author thought that the readers are too dumb to read a book written like a  book on spiritual awakening. And maybe he didn't have the writing skills to  make his point convincingly otherwise.<br />After a few pages I was so  insulted by the author's tone that I skimmed the rest, looking for nuggets  of insight. I found one: some people get their energy by draining it from  others, but giving your own energy willingly doesn't deplete it. That's all  you need to know, stripped of all the new age hooey and fake adventure  story.	2000-06-15

Short essays lightly describe the author's observations, and end (in most cases) with a bumper-sticker-esque proverb. Sometimes these text-bites are a summary of the essay, sometimes they're a  logical stretch (the first chapter, for example).<br />There are a few  insightful truths here, though. There's a good section on sacrifice in the  Relationships section. Customers sacrifice a great deal to do business with  you. So you're obligated to return the sacrifice even more.<br />A good,  though unstated, assumption here is that every business would do better to  think of itself as a service.<br />Ironically, one of the best sentences in  the book (in the Branding section) is a reasonable critique of this book:  &quot;...like most rules, the dying-brand rule is stated too broadly, and  thus misleads us.&quot;	2000-06-01

It's rare when a book that has me laughing out loud on the bus will also bring me close to tears  and make me want to remorize and recite passages to my wife. By the last  page, my only disappointment was the less-than-satisfying endings to some  characters' stories. I've since read several of his other books, thinking I  was now a serious Tom Robbins fan. I haven't found any of the others to  hold onto me as tightly as this one, so I think I'm instead a serious  Skinny Legs and All fan.	2000-05-03
