US	47412424	ROY3PJRE9IHFR	0843929820	926546897	Roses After Rain	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Sweet but nothing special	This book is a very typical formulaic romance.  The hero, heroine, and villain are almost cartoonish in their persona.  The heroine is your classic self sacrificing beautiful woman.  The hero is your basic great guy and the villain is just completely evil.  The storyline is sweet but it would probably appeal more to a younger reader who cares less about depth of character.  The characters have cartoonish personalities with no real depth.  It was a sweet book but nothing special about it.	2003-01-05

The plot is the heroine leaves her husband when she overhears him saying he doesn't really love her and only married her as a convenience.  A few months later she bumps into a man who looks just like her husband, only he says he's her husbands twin.  They begina steamy affair and eventually she finds out the man really is her husband and he has no twin.  This kind of makes me think the heroine is a complete idiot.  For one thing, the hero never mentions that he has a twin.  For another, how can the heroine who has been married to the guy, been intimate with him, not realize it is the same man?  I thought this made the heroine seem really dense.	2001-11-01

The hero and heroine are Cole Barton and Kristina Parker.  Kristina comes to Texas to see Cole's best friend Drake Carlson and ask him for help after she wounds a rich and influential man when he attacks her.  She knows she is only a lowly maid and will probably go to prison for wounding a well respected and wealthy man, even though she was only defending herself.  She leaves Philadelphia and goes to Texas under the guise of her employer Samantha Carlson, Drake's daughter, she plans to tell Drake the truth immediately, but when she gets to Texas Drake has had a heart attack and she cannot tell him the truth for fear the shock will kill him.  He has not seen Samantha since she was three, and  since Samantha and Kristina have similar coloring, he does not realize she is not his daughter.  He asks on his deathbed that she marry Cole so he can die in peace.  They marry and Kristina falls in love with Cole but fears what he will do when he finds out the truth. Sweet and romantic.	2001-10-28

Throughout the entire book he seems to only be using her and not really care about her at all.  And his reason that he gives for dumping her without a word does not in anyway justify it or make me sympathetic toward his character.  Apparantly, he felt that even though she was a virgin she was so uninhibited he felt she would turn into a slut and break his heart and that is why he just up and married someone else.  The hero was a complete slime up until the very end, he never redeems himself.	2001-10-25

The hero treats her shabbily the entire book and she just takes it and then goes to him at the end and is ready to beg him to take her back when he is the one that has been cruel to her the entire book.  This book was painful to read.	2001-10-25
US	47412424	R1JUSKBMB9CJLN	0373122071	436049583	Savage Innocence	Books	2	21	23	N	N	lousy hero	The back cover for this book says:<br />Pregnant and single, Isobel Dorland yearns for a real family life  But though she's head over heels in love with the father of her child, she knows that he's in no position to offer her marriage.<br />Resolving that she must start anew, Belle leaves her hometown quietly-without telling Jared where she's going-or that she's carrying his baby.  But she hasn't reckoned on Jared's determination.  He wants her, and it can only be a matter of time before he discovers her whereabouts-and the truth.<br />What this doesn't tell you is that Jared is married and he and Isobel are actually sneaking around having an affair behind his wife's back.  Jared is a completely selfish a** who has no intention of ever leaving his wife because her father owns the company he works for and he knows he will have to leave his job if he leaves her.  Which he tells Isobel.  But he expects her to stick around and be happy being his little 'piece on the side'.  After she ends their affair, he follows her and actually has the gall to be angry when he finds her having an innocent lunch with another man.  Geez, how hypocritical can you get?  Also, the hero and heroine had zero chemistry and were actually together for what seemed like less than half the book.  The majority of the book was Isobel looking for her father.  I do not recommend this book.	2001-10-21
US	47412424	R2IQHBF2ELT2VC	0821723758	787672984	Captive Love	Books	3	5	5	N	N	blah	This book's heroine is Melissa Randall, who's family is killed and she is kidnapped by Indians.  During her captivity she manages to escape rape but angers her Indian owner who decides to sell her.  She is sold to Reid Forrester, a man she had met before while traveling.  <br />Part of what soured me to this book was Reid's attitude.  I realize this is a historical and women were treated different but this is still a romance and Reid's attitude that Melissa deserved whatever she got, including getting raped, for being so beautiful did not sit well with me.	2001-10-21

I got sick of 400 pages of Rhys giving and giving and begging for her love and her rejecting him and treating him like dirt.  I really began to hate the female heroine.  If they just hadn't kept dragging it out, having her reject him over and over again, this book might have been tolerable.  As it is, the ending did not make up for all the ... in between.	2001-06-25

They are two members of feuding clans.  David kidnaps Breyandra and keeps her prisoner in his castle and they fall in love.  There is plenty of action and a mystery to be solved.  The character development is very good.  The book is funny as well as sensual and emotional.  It is a selection of the Gloria Diehl Book Club which I had never heard of before reading this book but from now on I will look for that seal because this book was an excellent read.	2001-06-03
US	47412424	RTWK7Z6VCDR5S	0380768763	432457876	Irresistible	Books	4	9	11	N	N	worthwhile	I definitely give this book a five for the main romance.  Which was extremely sweet as well as passionate.  The two main characters, Jade and Matt are extremely easy to get attached to and have great chemistry together.  The reason I am not giving this book five stars is because during the course of the book, five little side romances happened, all Jade's prostitute friends ended up finding men and getting married.  I found these to be boring and they slowed down the story.  None of them were well developed, just boom!  Suddenly all Jade's friends are in love and getting married, which really just made it that much more farfetched.  Especially considering the time period, where women are generally considered to be unmarriagable if they are not still a virgin, that five prostitutes could just suddenly find men to marry them within a matter of months I found extremely unrealistic.  The romances felt very forced and unreal, they really slowed the book down.  And I found the women to be remarkably idealistic considering what they did for a living.  I mean, one apparently fell in love with one guy who she was sleeping with, but she had hopes he would marry her.  I found that to be ridiculously idealistic thought for a prostitute.  It wasn't like the guy was courting her, he was just sleeping with her, like a ton of other guys she's slept with, what on earth made her think he would marry her.  Of course he did, but it was very forced and unrealistic, just like all the other side romances.  Overall, the majority of the book was good.  The main storyline was very good.  The side romances ruined the book a little though.  The book is a worthwhile read though.	2001-01-17

The sex scenes are really hot and there is alot of emotional upheaval.  It is your basic kidnapping romance, the heroine Summer Ashton is forced to wed by her father.  She is headed to meet her new husband when her ship is attacked by another ship.  The captain of the other ship is Brent Douglas and he has a grudge against Summer's husband.  He decides to  get back at him through her.  When he realizes she is innocent and she was forced to marry he no longer uses her as a form of revenge and they have a steamy affair, but Summer cannot forget what he did, so even though she desires him she is forever fighting him and at odds with him.  This book has plenty of passion, the story is fast paced and interesting.  The female character is not a complete doormat for the male, like they tend to be with these older historical romances.  I recommend this book.	2000-11-13

This book is exactly like several others of hers.  It seems Ms. Hess simply changes the names and the storyline a bit but it is essentially the same book.  The characters, the hero and heroine, the villains, they never change, they have no real depth to distinguish them as unique.  They are exactly the same in every book.  This is okay if you've only read one or two of her books, but it gets annoying after a while.  They are all exactly the same in almost all her books.  Another thing that bothered me is that one of the villains in this book is a woman named Raven, in another of Hess's books, her heroine is named Raven.  It is not the same woman, but this still bothered me.  Also, must she always name the horse Beauty?  Can she not come up with something slightly more original?  Also, in the book, she keeps emphasizing how the main villain, the heroine's uncle is fat.  She keeps mentioning it and emphasizing it over and over again and I found it to be a bit excessive.  Yeah, I heard you mention it the first time okay?  I couldn't really like the hero or the heroine.  The hero seemed to be selfish and have a tendency to jump to stupid conclusions as did the heroine.  I enjoyed her other books better, I don't know if it is because I read them first or they were actually better, but I thought Raven and Wildfire were much better than this one.	2000-11-12
