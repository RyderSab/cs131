The \\"Tsar Bomba\\" was useless from a military point of view, but as a terror and propaganda device, this 100-megaton (or more) monstrosity was highly effective. Basically, this bomb could kill incredible numbers of people. As Filger's character \\"Dr. Lazar\\" explains in the book, detonation of this doomsday device in downtown Manhattan would incinerate New York City, and most of the city's suburbs in Connecticut, New Jersey and Long Island. Beyond that, \\"cities such as Philadelphia and New Haven would be severely damaged,\\" while \\"the fallout [would] cause mass casualties across a wide portion of the American eastern seaboard and Midwest...\\" In the end, such a bomb would probably kill 80 million people. <br /> <br />Against another nation, of course, like the Soviet Union, we had our own nuclear deterrent to an attack with such a weapon.

Without MAD, the main hope of stopping such an attack, which would essentially end America as we know it, is intelligence, nuclear non-proliferation efforts, and counter-terrorist activities of various kinds. Even with all that, however, it is still possible that a group like Al Qaeda could -- possibly with the help of scientists from places like Pakistan, North Korea and Russia (the scenario spelled out in \\"King of Bombs\\") -- construct such a device.

In fact, you'll probably read it in a few hours, possibly in a cold sweat, but certainly with a strong feeling of unease. <br /> <br />My main criticisms of this book are twofold: 1) it needs a good editing to work out some of the awkward sentences and grammar (a hazard of self-publishing); and 2) it probably should be a bit less heavy-handed in its portrayal of the thinly-veiled George W.

Not that I have any sympathy for the job this Administration has done on nuclear non-proliferation or on securing the \\"homeland,\\" but it would be a shame if some readers were turned off by the strong political viewpoint.

Dealing in Murder is a well-paced mystery novel with plot turns to keep the pages turning.  The book is mostly written in the brash, no-nonsense voice of Molly Doyle, an interesting character for whom I found myself rooting as she establishes a new life for herself, with the details of her past lurking.  Also intriguing is the interaction between Molly and the police chief.  The book has many other, shall I say, colorful characters, and is set in a beautiful location.  Flinn's descriptions of the setting - Carmel, California - and her knowledge of the world of antique dealers give the book a realistic air and allow the reader to escape into Molly's world, as she tries to solve a murder for which she is the prime suspect.  -- Kelly	2005-05-31

As Graham Allison describes in his book and more graphically on his website ([...] the consquences of a nuclear bomb -- even a small, crude, or \\"flawed\\" bomb -- on a major US city would be devastating.  <br /> <br />That's why Allison so forcefully lays out his \\"Three Nos\\":  1) No Loose Nukes; 2) No New Nascent Nukes; and 3) No New Nuclear Weapons States.   According to Allison, if those \\"Three Nos\\" are not followed, nuclear terrorism in a U.S. city is nearly inevitable, killing hundreds of thousands of people and possibly destroying our democracy in the process.  That, among other reasons, is why Allison calls nuclear terrorism \\"The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.\\"  So what are we doing to prevent it?	2005-02-12

It's not awful or anything, especially the early parts of the book, but ultimately it just doesn't really hang together very well.  Also, the book kind of fizzles and cops out at the end, which left me a bit disappointed and unsatisfied. Still, having said all that, there's some really good stuff in \\"Time Out of Joint,\\" including the usual, fascinating PKD-esian themes: the nature of reality; personal identity; memory; sanity vs. \\"insanity;\\" paranoia (or are they REALLY out to get you?); authoritarianism; war; conformity vs. individuality.  And on the positive side, Dick DOES show flashes of brilliance during the early parts of the book, especially in the bathroom lightbulb scene and of course the disappearing hot dog stand scene, but to my tastes, Dick reverts to cliches and predictable plot devices in the last part of the book.  He also lets certain narrative threads and characters just sort of unravel or disappear.  All this doesn't completely ruin \\"Time Out of Joint,\\" but it does cause it to miss out on possible greatness and settle for just a \\"good\\" rating.  Go ahead and take this one out of the library, but if you've never read Philip Dick before, I'd personally recommend that you start with \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" my personal favorite so far.	2004-11-11

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	105	127	N	N	Toto, We're Not in Kansas Anymore	In \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" Dorothy and Toto are startled to find that they are no longer in Kansas anymore.  In \\"What's the Matter with Kansas?\\", Thomas Frank reaches a similar conclusion.  And just as Dorothy and Toto left Kansas on many levels -- physical, cultural, philosophical, spiritual -- so has Thomas Frank. In fact, after reading just a few pages of \\"What's the Matter with Kansas,\\" it's apparent that, although Mr. Frank may have been born in Kansas, at this point in his life he has gone well \\"over the rainbow,\\" far far away from the Kansas of his youth.   <br /> <br />At the same time, of course, Kansas has moved far far away from Thomas Frank as well.  The result is that, today, a veritable Great Plains of distance lies between all the Thomas Franks of the world (liberal, intellectual, highly educated, secular, \\"fact-based,\\" liberal, mainly Democratic) and all those who, either literally or figuratively, see themselves more as \\"Kansans\\" (socially and culturally conservative, anti-intellectual, religious, \\"faith-based,\\" conservative, mainly Republican).   <br /> <br />It is obvious that Mr. Frank feels honestly and deeply saddened, puzzled, betrayed, and angered by what he believes has happened to Kansas, and also to \\"Kansas\\" -- the Republican Party and the United States as a whole -- over the past few decades.  Perhaps most frustrating to Frank is his belief that the people of Kansas/\\"Kansas\\" are harming their own self interest by their behavior, and even more so by their stubborn refusal (as Frank sees it) to wake up and realize the error of their ways.  Therein lies the major flaw of \\"What's The Matter With Kansas,\\" and also the answer to the subtitle's implied question -- how DID Conservatives manage to \\"win the heart of America?\\" <br /> <br />As to the first question, \\"What's the Matter with Kansas,\\" Frank's answer is that people are not voting their own interests.  However, this is a purely economic analysis, and even there Frank's book falls short in explanatory value.  The problem with Frank's analysis, aside from its overly anecdotal and non-empirical nature, is that human beings are not just economic beings (\\"Homo economicus\\"), but instead are a highly complicated species driven by a wide range of \\"rational\\" and \\"irrational\\" motivations, urges, desires, beliefs, and drives.  Generally speaking, that's what the conservative movement understood many years ago, and that's what the liberal movement -- or what's left of it -- failed to understand on a true, gut level.   <br /> <br />No doubt, at first glance it appears wildly paradoxical, even irrational, for people to vote against their own economic self interest.  What if, however, other more subjective interests -- faith, nationalism, traditionalism -- outweigh the more objective economic ones?  What if, in other words, Marx was completely wrong -- as he was in so many other ways -- in believing that economic class interests trumped all others?   <br />Perhaps Marx might have asked himself, \\"what's wrong with my theory\\" instead of \\"what's wrong with the people who won't follow my theory?\\"  And perhaps Thomas Frank and the Democratic Party should ask themselves the same question.   <br /> <br />In other words, instead of waiting for the (supposed) fatal flaws and inherent contractions of the Republican coalition -- Wall Street bankers, poor working folks, fundamentalists and libertarians -- to self destruct of its own accord, perhaps the Democratic Party and progressive movement in general should ask themselves what THEY can do to \\"Win the Heart of America.\\"  If not, my guess is that conservative Republicans will keep on winning that heart, while liberal/progressive Democrats will keep losing it.   <br /> <br />As a proud progressive Democrat myself, I say that it's time to start winning for a change.  Perhaps the first step is to stop talking about what's the matter with Kansas/\\"Kansas,\\" about what an evil, nasty, cynical bunch the Republicans are, and about how deluded and stupid those \\"Kansans\\" are to vote the way they do. Instead, Democrats might want to start talking about how they can appeal to \\"Kansas,\\" and about how they can win back \\"Kansans'\\" hearts and votes.  If not, the Democratic Party risks being carried away by a political twister, never to return to Kansas - or \\"Kansas\\" - again. <br />	2004-10-25
US	49404909	RC54MIT1CU2AO	0974293814	197288993	Poison Darts: Protecting the Biodiversity of Our World	Books	5	9	9	N	N	The Hard Nosed Environmentalist	For those of you who haven't read Bjorn Lomborg's writings, the title of my review is a (sarcastic) play on the Danish statistician's controversial book, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\\" a title which really should be renamed, \\"The Lies of a Former Environmentalist Gone Over to the Dark Side.\\"   In contrast to Lomborg's Panglossian view that the state of the Earth's biodiversity (and everything else, for that matter) is wonderful and getting better all the time (his statistics \\"prove\\" it!), Russ Finley starts right away from the obvious premise that Lomborg is terribly wrong, and that, unfortunately, the Earth's ecosystems are dying fast.   <br /> <br />Unlike many other environmentalists, Finley doesn't waste his time -- or the reader's -- dreaming of a world in which human nature miraculously changes, turning everyone into nature-loving, tree-hugging, bike-riding, commune-living, hemp-wearing, granola-eating, self-sacrificing angels.  Instead, Finley simply accepts human nature, warts and all, as a given and proceeds from there with his thoughts on \\"attacking the problem [of massive biodiversity loss and environmental devastation] by channeling human desires.\\"   <br /> <br />Finley's refreshing, clear-eyed view of human nature allows him -- unlike many other environmentalists -- to get right to the heart of the matter:  there are far, FAR too many humans on the planet, and as long as that's the case biodiversity is doomed.  The only question, then, is what to do about this situation.  Edward O. Wilson, one of the world's greatest living scientists author of twenty books (including The Future of Life, The Ants, On Human Nature, Sociobiology, and Consilience), winner of two Pulitzer prizes plus dozens of science prizes, and a man known as \\"the father of biodiversity,\\" has stated that we currently find ourselves in a \\"bottleneck of overpopulation and wasteful consumption.\\" Wilson further believes that we are in a race between \\"technoscientific forces that are destroying the living environment\\" and \\"those that can be harnessed to save it.\\"  Essentially, that's where Russ Finley takes the baton and runs with it. <br /> <br />So, what does Finley suggest?  First, and most importantly, that we develop and distribute a \\"take it and forget it\\" contraceptive (\\"TIFIC\\") as soon as possible, in order to reset the default human reproductive setting to \\"off\\" (don't worry, it can be turned back on again with another pill), thereby slashing unplanned pregnancies to a bare minimum and reversing human population growth before it's too late.  Second, and nearly as importantly, Finley suggests that we forcefully and creatively defend the remaining islands of biodiversity for as long as it takes until absolute human population levels decline substantially (perhaps to 1-2 billion?).  Third, Finley argues that we should harness human nature -- competitiveness, greed, acquisitiveness, status-seeking, sexual desire, religious belief, technological prowess, whatever it takes -- in SERVICE of the biodiversity protection effort, not at ODDS with it.  This, in and of itself, is a strikingly different, far more powerful and effective approach than most environmentalists have employed in the past.  Unlike most of those other approaches, Finley's ideas actually have a chance of working, albeit just in the nick of time to save the bulk of the world from a final, great mass extinction, possibly taking humanity down with it in the process.  <br /> <br />As a book, \\"Poison Darts\\" is organized into two main volumes, the first being a rollicking, enjoyable, swashbuckling adventure story about a fictional \\"think tank\\" (of brilliant oddballs and other assorted characters) which sets about to save -- and goes a long way towards doing so -- the planet's biodiversity.  Volume 2 is a series of thought-provoking essays on overpopulation, human nature, and \\"Environmentalism - American Style.\\"  Finley is clearly an engineer in the best sense of the word, with his rigorous, logical mind taking apart the system, diagnosing exactly what the problem with it is, and figuring out a solution - or at least a temporary patch.   <br /> <br />Fortunately, and unlike many engineers, Finley doesn't just throw facts, figures, and techie solutions at the reader. Instead, Finley's brings to the table a good deal of writing ability (although a more rigorous professional editing job would be helpful to work out a few kinks), with an excellent feel for politics, science, economics, and human psychology/society.  In addition, Finley turns out to be a fine storyteller; I read the fictional Volume I in just a few hours and could hardly put it down.   <br /> <br />Like the rest of the book, Volume II is refreshing, honest, reasonable, even courageous in its willingness to tell it like it is and to take on powerful forces of intolerance and ignorance, including certain well-known religious movements and institutions.  Finley explains his ideas clearly, in a straightforward, passionate, at-times humorous manner ((sly references to Frank Herbet's \\"Dune,\\" for instance), and has an outstanding ability to boil complex topics down in a way that is helpful but never patronizing.  This is a very useful combination of abilities - deep technical/scientific knowledge plus strong communications skills -- that few authors possess.   <br /> <br />All in all, I would say that \\"Poison Darts\\" is an enjoyable, edifying, important book that should be read by everyone who cares about \\"protecting the biodiversity of our world.\\"  I strongly recommend it, and look forward to joining the (fictional) \\"Ecosystem Protection International\\" organization sometime soon!	2004-10-11

Written in 1993, it is fascinating to re-read \\"Russia 2010\\" today, 11 years later -- but still 6 years before the ultimate forecast date of the title -- to see how Dan Yergin and Thane Gustafson's predictions are doing.  Given the events of recent months, with the school massacre in southern Russia and other terrorist actions, the ongoing brutal war in Chechnya, the continued clampdown on freedom of the press and civil society in Russia, the prosecution/persecution of leading business moguls (specifically, Mikhail Khodorkovsky), and President Putin's  dramatic moves to increase his power, Russia should definitely be getting a lot more attention than most people have been giving it.   Which makes the analysis of \\"Russia 2010\\" more relevant than ever. <br /> <br />Most importantely, what Yergin and Gustafson did in \\"Russia 2010\\" was NOT to make absolute forecasts or to simply (and mindlessly) extrapolate from the situation at the time, but instead to apply powerful \\"scenario planning\\" techniques to thinking through the most likely futures for Russia.  Back in 1993, the authors laid out four main scenarios:  1) \\"muddling down;\\" 2) the \\"Two-Headed Eagle;\\" 3) \\"Time of Troubles;\\" and 4) \\"Chudo\\" (economic miracle).  How did the authors do? <br /> <br />Today, in 2004, we can confidently conclude that #4 was wrong -- there has been no Russian economic miracle, although oil prices have certainly helped Russia recover from the post-Soviet low point of the early- to mid-1990s.  It also turns out that #1, \\"muddling down,\\" the scenario that came closest to simply extrapolating from the existing situation at the time (as most forecasters erroneously do) was somewhat off the mark in the long run, although its predictions of a \\"relatively free atmosphere\\" and \\"weak Russian central government\\" did hold true for a few years at least.  Scenario #3 is interesting, as it accurately anticipates separatist tendencies (although not specifically mentioning Chechnya) and the reaction of the\\"Russian Bear\\" to reassert itself.  To some extent, that's exactly what we see today.   <br /> <br />It is Scenario #4 (the \\"Two-Headed Eagle\\"), however, that appears to have hit the nail squarely - almost eerily so -- on the head.  In \\"Russia 2010,\\" Yergin and Gustafson posit that an attempted assassination on the Russian President by a \\"petty hoodlum\\"/mafia type \\"from the north Caucasus\\" leads to: a) Russian military action in that unnamed north Caucasus republic; b) a popular call for a crackdown on \\"the mafia, on corruption, and the private economy, which are all rolled into one in many people's minds;\\" c) the central government taking advantage of this situation to consolidate its own power, rein in the provinces, strengthen the executive over the legislative branch, reassert its control over natural resource exports; and d) an \\"ambivalent\\" and half-hearted Western reaction to these moves.  Sound familiar?  It should, because Scenario #4 -- the \\"premature reconstitution of a strong state\\" -- is almost exactly what we're seeing right now in Russia. <br /> <br />What Yergin and Gustafson have done, among other things, is to have demonstrated the tremendous value of \\"scenario planning\\" -- rigorously thinking through possible future paths as opposed to mindlessly extrapolating from the present.  Although the latter course of action may be the easier (and lazier) way of trying to predict the future, it is also the least helpful and least accurate.  Why would we think the future would be just like the present and recent past?  The simple answer? Failure of imagination, and the lack of courage to go out on a limb and stand out from the herd.  As Yergin and Gustafson point out, the normal \\"extrapolate from the current situation\\" forecasting methodology failed us miserably during the past few decades, missing most of the major turning points of those years.  For instance, just about nobody managed to predict the Iranian Revolution, the collapse of the Soviet Union, therise of Al Qaeda, 9/11, the course of oil prices from 1973 to now, or just about anything else during that period.  Yergin and Gustafson, however, by spending some time and effort to actually think through possible scenarios, hit the nail on the head regarding the future of Russia in one of their four posited \\"scenarios\\" -- with two of the three others having large elements of truth as well.  True, it's not 2010 yet, but as of September 2004, Yergin and Gustafson are looking pretty darned smart!	2004-09-19

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	20	23	N	N	Eppur si muove!	\\"And yet it moves!\\"  This could be the epitaph for Paul O'Neill's time as Treasury Secretary in the administration of George W. Bush.  The quote refers, of course, to Galileo -- an empiricist and truth seeker confronting powerful forces of ideology and religion regarding the question, \\"does the Earth revolve around the sun?\\"  After being brought in front of the Inquisition in 1633, Galileo was forced to recant what he knew to be scientifically, empirically correct based on observation and inductive reasoning -- that the Earth was not the center of the universe, but instead was like other celestial bodies and revolved around the Sun.  In the short run, of course, the forces of rigid ideology won the day, and the Earth remained central.  In the end, however, the overwhelming factual, empirical evidence won out, and the Earth was acknowledged by nearly everyone -- with the possible exception of John Ashcroft -- to revolve around the sun. <br /> <br />Fast forward nearly 400 years from Galileo, and we have Paul O'Neill, another empiricist, confronting the forces of ideology (and politics!) on economic, environmental, and other matters in the Bush Administration.  By O'Neill's account, which as far as I can tell is truthful, Bush is a President profoundly uninterested in the facts, in rigorous analysis, and especially in asking the question, \\"Why?\\"  Same thing with people like Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Larry Lindsey, and Karl Rove.  O'Neill describes a White House in which the ideologues and winning-is-everything-even-if-it-means-bad-policy people are arrayed against those like O'Neill himself, Secretary of State Powell, former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (not to mention Dubya's father, most of his father's close advisors, and past Republican Presidents like Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford).  This points to a fundamental (pun intended) shift in the Republican Party over the past few years, from a relatively centrist party dominated mainly by competent professionals to a Hard Right Wing party of \\"true believers\\" and spinmeisters.  In the end, we all know who won most of the battles between those two camps, and it wasn't those who believe that fact and truth (O'Neill, Greenspan, Powell, etc.) should trump spin and ideology (Rove, Lindsey, Cheney, etc.).  In other words, this is NOT your father's Republican Party.  Literally.  <br /> <br />In the end, of course, O'Neill was fired for his heresy in stressing the importance of fiscal prudence, of designing tax cuts packages that were based on sound economics, of dealing with important issues (like Global Warming) and not simply denying their very existence.  Unlike Galileo, however, O'Neill has not only never recanted, but instead has written \\"The Price of Loyalty,\\" a book that should be read by all who are considering their choices on November 2.  More than that, O'Neill should be listened to by all those who, like Galileo, value facts, rationality, and logic over blind ideology and cynical political calculation.	2004-09-18

In \\"Wicked:  The Life and Time of the Wicked Witch of the West,\\" everything you thought you knew from watching MGM's classic (1939) Wizard of Oz movie is turned completely upside down by its wickedly creative author, Gregory Maguire.  For instance, the \\"Wicked Witch,\\" in this treatment, is arguably neither wicked nor even truly a witch.  Quite the contrary; in many ways Maguire presents her as a heroic, even noble figure, fighting against an evil tyrant while defending the oppressed and the downtrodden --humans, animals, and especially the intelligent, sentient \\"Animals\\" of Oz. <br /> <br />And who is the evil tyrant the \\"Wicked Witch\\" is fighing against in Maguire's book?  Interestingly, it's none other than the Wizard of Oz himself, who in the movie (and original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" book) claimed to be \\"a very good man\\" but a \\"very bad wizard.\\" There, he was presented as a bumbling, nice, harmless old humbug. Here, in stark contrast, the Wizard is depicted instead as a powerfully effective, manipulative, dictatorial, Machiavellian wizard/ruler/man.  Truly a horse of a different color! <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the character of Dorothy comes in for a few interesting twists and turns at Maguire's hand.  For one thing, far from being the central character as she was in the movie, with her innocent quest to return to Kansas as the central narrative line, Dorothy is presented here as a sort of last minute -- albeit powerful -- afterthought.  In fact, the Dorothy character as viewed by Maguire is a sort of tornado in and of herself, appearing on the scene one day out of nowhere, causing great destruction and death without even meaning to do so, and then disappearing just as quickly, leaving everything turned upside down, inside out.   <br /> <br />In addition to the character differences, Maguire has essentially transformed the entire WORLD of Oz, fleshing out, expanding upon, even completely re-imagining that world entirely.  Just one example of a major change from Baum's original Oz vision is in Maguire's treatment of religion.  In Baum's world of Oz, there are no particular religious forces to speak of.  In contrast, Maguire's Oz contains powerful religious currents -- Unionism, Lurlinism, the Pleasure Faith, belief in Ozma, etc. -- swirling around and intertwining with politics, money, sex, education, and social structure in complex, sometimes confusing and paradoxical ways.  Maguire's world, in other words, is a complex, dangerous, sexual, grown up, mature, political, ADULT world, as opposed to the children's Oz we normally think of from the 1939 MGM classic with Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton, Ray Bolger, Frank Morgan et al.  In this context, please note: this book is for adults, NOT little kids! <br /> <br />Ultimately, what \\"Wicked\\" is about is Evil and Wickedness, the nature of those things, what they really mean, where they come from, how they work, and whether or not it's possible to fight them, etc.  Is the \\"Wicked Witch\\" really wicked?  In Baum's Oz, she certainly is, but only in a stereotypical, almost comical way.  In contrast, Maguire's world contains real Good and Evil in all their complexity, with the trick being to figure out which is which.  Thus, the \\"Wicked Witch\\" (Elphaba) is presented as a rebel, even a terrorist, fighting against an oppressive, violent, unjust dictatorship.  So what does that make her?  And Glinda the \\"Good Witch\\" is presented as somewhat of an apolitical airhead, a bit stuck on herself, not very nice or tolerant in many ways, but friends with Elphaba.  What does that make HER?  No doubt, Elphaba is frustrated and angry, but is that anger justified?  Where does it come from?  Does it matter? <br /> <br />If these types of questions interest you, specifically in the context of a creative, skillful \\"Wizard of Oz\\" re-imagining, then you'll probably like this book a lot.  I personally find this stuff fascinating, so I loved \\"Wicked,\\" despite occasional frustrations with Maguire for not fleshing outhis ideas a bit more than he did.  With that minor quibble, I strongly recommend this book.  If nothing else, you will never think of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" -- Dorothy, the Munchkins, or (of course) the Wicked Witch -- in the same way again!	2004-09-11

Frank Baum \\"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" book.  However, after reading \\"Wicked\\" by Gregory Maguire, which completely re-imagines Baum's creation, I became very curious to go back to the original and actually read it.  The library had a number of choices available, but when I saw the gorgeous Centennial Edition \\"Annotated Wizard of Oz,\\" I knew this was the one for me.  And I was not disappointed!<br /><br />What Michael Patrick Hearn has created here has got to be one of the best annotated books I've ever come across (up there with Douglas Anderson's \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\"), a true labor of love.  If you're interested in L. Frank Baum's life, this book is definitely for you.  And if you're interested in articulate, insightful explanations of Baum's \\"Wizard of Oz\\" world, this is also the book for you.  Finally, if you are interested in the cultural and literary significance of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" once agin, \\"The Annotated Wizard of Oz\\" by Michael Patrick Hearn is definitely the book for you. Beautifully illustrated, including W.W. Denslow's original color plates and the exact text of the 1900 Baum \\"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" book, this is a tremendous hundredth anniversary tribute to Baum and to all the characters from the world of Oz.  I strongly recommend this book!	2004-09-11

As with any collection of essays, the quality level varies, with a few essays really standing out, although not one of them is bad.  The main theme here is not pro-or anti-technology per se, but simply that rapid technological and scientific progress has huge implications for humans, so we'd better give the issue some serious thought.  The overarching question, as alluded to by the title, is how we live with the \\"genie\\" of rapid technological change, now that it's out of the bottle.   <br /> <br />Perhaps my favorite essay is the one by Richard Powers, which actually had me rather rattled.  Even at the end of Powers' piece, I couldn't decide if what he described really happened to him, or if it was the basis for a new, Matrix-like sci-fi plot on Artificial Intelligence run amok.  In addition to Powers, the chapter by Ray Kurzweil is also fascinating, although a bit repetitive if you've read Kurzweil's book, \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines.\\"  Still, Kurzweil's musings are fascinating, as he ponders whether or not the combination of robotics, biotechnology, and nanotech might be the doom of us all, or whether instead it might lead to a new age in which humans evolve into a hybrid man-machine species like the Borg in Star Trek. <br /> <br />Other chapters in the book present further riffs on various aspects of technology and science. D. Michelle Addington writes an intriguing, if somewhat confusing, chapter on one particular technology -- HVAC -- to illustrate how \\"our technological world is constructed by our beliefs and not necessarily by progress or science.\\"    Lori Andrews discusses genetic engineering of humans and a world in which \\"people may be treated as products.\\"  Gregor Wolbring contributes a well executed chapter on technology and the concept of \\"disability.\\"  Philip Kitcher discusses the types of science that \\"should be done.\\" Christina Desser's chapter provides a literary meditation on technology and human \\"connectedness.\\"  Finally, Alan Lightman discusses the feeling that technology is intruding into the most private aspects of life, interfering even with the ability to think quietly, to \\"waste time,\\" and to connect (that word again) with one's soul. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a fine collection of essays, well worth reading in today's world of tremendous technological promise -- and threat.	2004-08-08

Or possibly it's the vertigo-inducing thought that there's a whole set of cellular actors with agendas of their own out there manipulating human behavior. But, for whatever reason, Bryan Sykes' book, &quot;Adam's Curse: A Future Without Men,&quot; made my head spin.  <br />  <br /> Is Sykes' main point in &quot;Adam's Curse&quot;: 1) that the Y chromosome is dying out and thank goodness it is, because if not it would eventually destroy us all? 2) that the Y chromosome is dying out and actually that's a bad thing which we'd better do something to stop? 3) that the Y chromosome is neither better nor worse than the X chromosome, each one fighting to replicate itself down the generations (alternative book title suggestion: &quot;Chromosomes Gone Wild: The Battle of the Sexes Goes Cellular!&quot;)? 4) that the Y chromosome is truly and veritably a &quot;curse,&quot; guiding the Vikings, the Genghis Khans of the world, and men in general to rape, pillage, and burn their way through history? 5) that the species -- and the planet, for that matter -- would be better off if men were completely eliminated and women reproduced with each other? 6) that male-female sexual reproduction is inherently a bad thing? 7) that we we are all just puppets of our chromosomes and DNA, which are using us to their own ends? 8) that all these issues are to be looked at objectively and dispassionately as a scientist? 9) alternatively, that these issues should be considered subjectively and emotionally by a human being with a particular set of beliefs regarding civilization? Ouch, my head hurts! <br />  <br /> Whatever the answers to the questions posed above, in my opinion &quot;Adam's Curse&quot; is well worth reading as a fascinating and important, if strange and disturbing, book. Bryan Sykes is certainly a serious scientist (professor of genetics at Oxford University), so his findings and musings -- strange and even outrageous as they appear -- can't beso easily dismissed. Sykes has done a great deal of research, no question about it, and he lays that research out here in a readable, direct, and engaging -- if sometimes rambling -- way.  <br />  <br /> One caveat: I suspect that to judge whether Sykes is on the right track or not, it would help to know a lot more about the latest developments in genetic science than someone like myself. Still, Sykes is a fine storyteller, and one of the rare scientists -- Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould spring to mind - who can actually explain things in a readable way to non-specialists. The bottom line? If you're interested in the dramatic, fascinating &quot;war between the sexes&quot; at its most fundamental, genetic level, then this is a book you ought to consider reading.	2004-07-30

Tastefully done, filled with life, friends, laughter, and lots of love, this is a beautiful book about a truly beautiful, talented, strong but vulnerable young woman.  <br />  <br /> So who was Eva Cassidy? A woman with incredible talent, of course, and the ability to reach millions of people with that talent. But, as &quot;Songbird&quot; so richly details, Eva Cassidy was also a normal, complicated human being. A sensitive, shy person who loved art and nature. A perfectionist who could be extremely hard on herself and -- sometimes -- on others as well. A person who wanted badly to connect with others but found it difficult, even painful, to do so. A person &quot;filled with emotions&quot; but &quot;closed, really closed,&quot; as her friend Anna Karen Kristinsdottir described her. A strong woman but also a &quot;shy, afraid little girl that needed to be hugged.&quot; An intensely loyal friend. A person with a great future ahead of her cruelly cut down just as she was taking off into the stratosphere. <br />  <br /> Although performing in public wasn't easy for Eva Cassidy, thankfully she was able to overcome and share her musical gift(s) with the world. Wow, could this woman sing! From jazz and blues to folk, from gospel to R&B and rock, Eva Cassidy could do it all -- with passion, with love for the music she sang, and with an incredible voice the likes of which don't come along very often.  <br />  <br /> Some adjectives to describe Eva Cassidy's voice? How about: haunting, gorgeous, inspirational, tear-jerking, powerful, tender, melodic, eclectic, amazing, astonishing, heartfelt, intelligent, poignant, original, awe-inspiring, brilliant. I guess that's enough for starters! And if you think I'm exaggerating, I strongly recommend that, as you read &quot;Songbird,&quot; you pause now and again to listen to Eva's versions of &quot;Fields of Gold,&quot; &quot;How Can I Keep From Singing,&quot; &quot;Over the Rainbow,&quot; &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; &quot;I Know You By Heart,&quot; and many others. If those songs -- and Eva Cassidy's life story -- don't send chills up your spine or touch you deeply, then I fear nothing ever will. <br />	2004-07-27

How can a &quot;celebrated Harvard professor and Pulitzer Prize-winning author&quot; write such a pretentious, embarassing, ridiculous, overwrought, narcissistic/self-centered, rambling, poorly edited (was it edited at all?), unreadable piece of drivel? Perhaps Coles was looking to cash in on the popularity of &quot;this guy they call 'The Boss,'&quot; or perhaps he was trying to get away from his Harvard ivory tower and slum it for a bit with a few &quot;average Americans,&quot; showing what a down-to-earth guy he really is? Unfortunately, those &quot;average Americans'&quot; comments and thoughts, as presented here by Robert Coles, end up as little more than incoherent ramblings which shed no light and provide little if any insight into Springsteen the man or the artist. Is this why Springsteen tries so hard to control what gets written and said about him? So that books like this don't ever get written? My advice to any Springsteen fans (or anyone else) out there thinking about buying this book: you were Born to Run -- far away from this godawful book!	2004-07-26
US	49404909	RWJPKZNCVILWD	074325547X	828250107	Plan of Attack	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Fascinating, but Woodward is missing a "W"	\\"Plan of Attack\\" is a good book in many ways, but in the end I believe it to be seriously flawed for three main reasons. First, Bob Woodward is provided only selective access to a number of key players, but definitely not to all of them. This means that Woodward's book is skewed, with certain key players getting extensive coverage, while others get almost none. Thus, we get a great deal of material on certain participants as they go about developing their \\"plan of attack\\" - President George W. Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld, General Tommy Franks -- but very little of others - Vice President Dick Cheney, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz (the \\"intellectual godfather and fiercest advocate for toppling Saddam.\\"), Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith (the \\"stupidest guy on the face of the earth,'' according to Franks), National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, CIA Director George Tenet; etc. Adding to this problem is that we generally get a more favorable view of those players who, apparently, talked to Woodward the most (Bush and Powell, for instance), and a far less favorable view of those who apparently did not speak to Woodward much, if at all (Cheney comes off particularly bad, as something of a Dr. Strangelove character in the eyes of others - is this true?).  <br />   <br /> Second, the selective access problem extends not just to players but also to information in general, with each person showing and/or (apparently) telling Woodward exactly what they want him to see and/or hear about themselves. This is particularly the case with President Bush himself, but also with other major Administration officials. As with other Bob Woodward books, the question arises: why on earth would Administration officials grant a reporter the kind of high-level, detailed access that they gave to Woodward? Could it be that they were using him to tell their story? Should we be shocked that this kind of thing goes on in Washington DC? Certainly not, but I believe that it harms the book, nonetheless.  <br />   <br /> Third, \\"Plan of Attack\\" is missing a broad perspective on the events that Woodward describes, some sort of conceptual framework to understand the events described, and a critical analysis of it all - the post-9/11 thinking in general, and the specific thinking vis-?-vis Iraq. In other words, Woodward's book is missing an extremely important \\"w\\" out of the five journalistic biggies. Thus, while we get lots of \\"who,\\" \\"what,\\" \\"when,\\" and \\"where,\\" we get almost none of (arguably) the most important \\"w,\\" WHY? Among others, we don't get answers to questions like, WHY did we go to war in Iraq? WHY did we do it when we did it, and in the way that we did? WHY didn't we go to war against other countries first, like Iran for example, a country much more connected to Islamic terrorism than Iraq ever was. WHY did key decisionmakers not question the intelligence more? WHY did Dick Cheney and others become obsessed with Iraq, to the extent that they are described as practically seized by a \\"fever\\" on the subject. Did these guys really believe that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with 9/11? If so, WHY? Lastly, WHY did President Bush seem so sure about the rightness of attacking Iraq, when so many others, including his own father's close advisors James Baker and Brent Scowcroft (and possibly Bush 41 himself) apparently had grave doubts? To all of these \\"why\\" questions, Woodward provides few if any answers, and precious little analysis at all, in \\"Plan of Attack.\\" That is a major problem with the book.   <br />   <br /> Still, even without the \\"why,\\" the other four \\"w\\"s are very interesting and generally well done here. Bob Woodward no doubt is a master at telling a story, at relating fascinating little anecdotes; and at conveying who did what, when and where. Thus, we get some riveting scenes as Colin Powell prepares for his \\"Adlai Stevenson moment\\" at the UN Security Council; as high-stakes international diplomacy proceeds along with a stealth U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf region; as CIA operatives infiltrate into northern Iraq work to work under primitive conditions, great stress, and danger in the months leading up to the war; as Don Rumsfeld pushes his military leaders close to the breaking point; and as the decision is made to roll the dice and try to decapitate the Iraqi regime by sending guided missiles towards the possible meeting place of Saddam Hussein and his sons hours before Bush's ultimatum to Saddam runs out. If any of this sounds interesting to you, then \\"Plan of Attack\\" is a book you should read. However, if you are more interested in understanding the reasons for attacking Iraq (why?), then you might want to look elsewhere, because that's not what you're going to get here.  <br />	2004-07-24
US	49404909	R2VR7WODKUL4ZO	031600023X	827119224	Worse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush	Books	5	48	57	N	N	Democracy in Danger	John Dean's book, \\"Worse than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush,\\" first and foremost is written by a man who, having served as Counsel to the President in the Nixon White House, should know about this sort of thing.   And, if even half of what Dean has to say here regarding this Administration's obsessive secrecy and right-wing extremism is true, then the Bush/Cheney \\"co-presidency\\" (as Dean describes it) is not just misguided but a serious menace to our nation's democracy and security.   Indeed, if the charges Dean levels against Bush and Cheney are correct, they amount to nothing less than a case for the removal from office and possible criminal prosecution of both men.  Certainly, other Presidents before Bush and Cheney have abused power, tortured the Constitution, and trampled on Americans' liberties, but Bush and Cheney are arguably the most dangerous ever because, in today's America, the careful system of checks and balances established by the Founding Fathers is in tatters, leaving few if any constraints on their power in a post-9/11 world of (apparently) permanent war.  Finally, in \\"Worse than Watergate,\\" Dean argues persuasively that the combination of Bush's tough guy/\\"bring it on!\\" attitude abroad and his assault on democracy and freedom at home \\"actually plays into the hands of terrorists,\\" allowing them to make \\"remarkable strides\\" and ultimately lead to our defeat.   This is scary stuff, if true. <br />The question is, then, how true are the charges that Dean lays out in \\"Worse than Watergate,\\" and are they as serious as he makes out?  Ultimately, this comes down to the author's credibility and, more importantly, to the evidence that he presents in support of his arguments.  In this reviewer's opinion, Dean is very strong on both counts.  As far as Dean's credibility is concerned, no doubt Bush/Cheney defenders will argue that Dean has none.  In making this argument, they undoubtedly will cite Dean's conviction on charges of conspiracyto obstruct justice and to defraud the government, as well as the four months he served in prison for his crimes in relation to the Watergate scandal.  They also undoubtedly will charge that Dean betrayed President Nixon by cooperating with prosecutors in revealing evidence of top-level White House involvement in the Watergate break-in, the existence of a Nixon \\"enemies list,\\" etc.  However, what they probably will NOT point out is that Dean's actions in 1974 were courageous, even heroic, in that they exposed -- at significant risk to himself --what Dean at the time (correctly) called \\"a cancer on the presidency.\\"  Although the Nixon White House slandered Dean and claimed he was a liar, what he said turned out to be true, and the \\"cancer\\" was excised just in the nick of time.   Whatever his other faults, Dean's actions in 1974 were central to exposing the crimes of Richard Nixon and possibly even to saving our democratic system of government.   In this reviewer's opinion, a person willing to stand up against the President of the United States has a great deal of credibility going for him.  In addition, Dean is certainly knowledgeable about Presidential abuse of power, having seen it from the inside, and if nothing else this also gives him credibility to speak on the subject.<br />As far as Dean's arguments are concerned, my feeling is that there is a great deal of powerful, documented evidence presented here to back them up.  The core of Dean's charges center on the following: 1) Bush's serious character issues, of which there are many, and his slimy prior business dealings, compared to which the actions of Martha Stewart pale in comparison; 2) Bush's obsessive secrecy, both as Governor of Texas and as President of the United States, and his desire to \\"free the presidency from all restraints\\" on its power; 3) Bush's misleading of Congress in order to lead the country to war in Iraq (an impeachable offense, in Dean's opinion); 4) the White House's possibly criminalleaking of a covert CIA agent's name in retaliation for her husband's refutation of Bush's claims regarding (supposed) Iraqi uranium purchases from Niger; 5) Cheney's failure to provide truthful and complete medical information about himself; 6) Cheney's past business (mis)conduct related to Halliburton; and 7) Cheney's (mis)conduct as Vice President, including his refusal to provide Congress's General Accounting Office with information regarding the National Energy Policy Development Group he headed.  <br />These are all extremely serious matters, and Dean provides a great deal of evidence and documentation to back them up.  Dean is also far from the only one who has raised these issues, as most everyone who has looked seriously at Bush and Cheney have uncovered some seriously unsavory material.  In the end, the only remaining question is what to do about the situation.  Given Republican control of Congress, Dean points out that there is essentially no chance of impeachment, or even a serious investigation by an independent counsel, at the present time.  Therefore, Dean concludes that the only hope is this year's election, in which the choice is obvious:  another mandate for Bush/Cheney to pursue their demolition of Democracy; or an 180-degree change of course before it's too late.  It is obvious that Dean strongly prefers the latter option, as should all patriotic, freedom-loving Americans.  Dean's warnings can, of course, be dismissed, but only at great peril to our nation.	2004-07-18
US	49404909	R1OKTPU54HHPZA	0375414576	786383328	My Life	Books	3	12	15	N	N	Interesting but flawed book by interesting but flawed man	I bought \\"My Life\\" because, despite all his flaws, I DO find Bill Clinton to be a fascinating, polarizing character.  I also hoped that Clinton would provide some new, original, insightful perspective on his life, his two-term Presidency, and possibly even recent events like 9/11 and the Iraq war.   So, how did he do?<br />As far as his Presidency is concerned, what Clinton gives us in \\"My Life\\" is, essentially, little more than a \\"data dump\\" - on Monday at 10 AM, he met with his task force on reinventing government (or whatever); at 11 AM he got a call from Yasser Arafat (or whoever), at noon he had lunch with some visiting delegation from Uzbekistan (or wherever), ad nauseum.   Boring as this sounds, it's actually not completely uninteresting to read about the varied and many-splendoured things a President does in a day, and to wonder how anyone can keep it all straight (while also keeping his sanity!) for 4 or 8 years!  Also, on the positive side, Clinton does somehow manage to keep the data dump of events flowing along in a semi-readable - if rambling, undisciplined, unreflective, and uninspired - way.  Still, it's unfortunate that Clinton wrote this part of the book in a mad rush to finish it before his publisher, Knopf, fired him or whatever.  The 8 years of the Clinton presidency involve important events and issues, both good and bad, and they deserve a much more thoughtful and reflective treatment (not to mention a good editing!) than they get in \\"My Life.\\" <br />A broader criticism I have of \\"My Life,\\" and this applies to the entire book, is that Clinton deluges the reader with facts and anecdotes for page after page after page, but somehow never manages to find time to discuss several controversial issues -- how he got out of serving in Vietnam; his womanizing; Whitewater -- in any real depth.  OK, sure, this is a political memoir and I'm not completely naïve; I fully realize that these things are self-serving.  But still, how can you have hundreds of pages on Clinton's political career in Arkansas and next to nothing about Gennifer Flowers (for instance) and not wonder, \\"what else is he hiding?\\"<br />Probably the best part of \\"My Life\\" is the first part, dealing with Clinton's childhood in Arkansas, his young adulthood experiences at Georgetown and Oxford, the interesting characters he meets along the way, and the tumultuous times he lives through during the  1950s and 60s.  There's actually some fascinating insight into Clinton's character in these pages, and overall he comes across as a more complex, less shallow figure than I had thought before reading the book.  For instance, the way Clinton describes it in \\"My Life,\\" his decision on whether or not to go to Vietnam was truly gut wrenching for him - as it was for millions of other Americans at the time.  Also, his account of the horrible year, 1968, is heartbreaking - for him and for all of us - as something in America (hope? vision?) dies along with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy.<br />Unfortunately, although \\"My Life\\" has a good number of positive things going for it, like an excellent American history lesson for instance, the negatives keep dragging it down.  Among other problems: the book is not well paced; it is both too long (at least as it's written) and too short (to cover all the material in any depth); it largely avoids/glosses over certain sensitive topics (Clinton's relationships with women in general, and specifically THAT woman Monica Lewinsky); it pins nearly all his problems on one out-of-control person - independent counsel Ken Starr - while apparently \\"forgiving\\" everyone else (are we supposed to believe that Clinton really forgives his bitter enemies?); and it devotes too little time and energy to true and sincere reflection (perhaps a lot more time has to pass before Clinton will be willing and/or able to do that?).  <br />In the end, just like his Presidency, Bill Clinton's autobiography could have been worse, but it also could have been a lot better.  Too bad Clinton was in such a rush to get the book out before this year's election season kicks in. But then again, I guess we shouldn't be surprised; with Bill Clinton, EVERYTHING is political.	2004-07-09

Along with the bin, I received a colorful, short (30-page) book, called &quot;Home Composting Made Easy.&quot;  Unfortunately, I didn't read the book right away, and the next thing you know, the winter had set in.  For several months, as the temperature dropped into the teens or even single digits, I gave the compost bin -- or the book -- little thought...<br />Early the next spring, I looked inside my compost bin and, big surprise, not a lot of composting had gone on during those frigid December, January, and February months.  It was right then that I realized, &quot;hey, I have no idea what the heck I'm doing here!&quot;  <br />Luckily, I still had that colorful, little book on composting, and pretty soon I had the answers to all my questions:  the pile needed water (duh!) and turning (double duh!) in order to aerate it.  And really, that's all it took, regular turning and moistening, and now I've got a bin full of rich compost, &quot;black gold&quot; as the book calls it.  Boy, is my garden going to be happy when I spread it around!  Anyway, the moral of this story is that composting is rewarding, environmentally beneficial, and not difficult at all - assuming, of course, that you've got &quot;Home Composting Made Easy&quot; and that you actually read it!	2004-06-22

At the time, I thought that the length of a book somehow corresponded to its difficulty level, and that if I could read a 1,000+ page book, then I must be REALLY smart and also grown up!  Anyway, one of the first books I decided to read, based on these sophisticated criteria, was &quot;The Source,&quot; by James Michener.  Surprisingly, I found out that the book was actually easy to read, fascinating, and highly entertaining, and I whizzed right through it (boy, did I think I was smart afte that)!  I remember being completely engrossed as the centuries flew past, as conquering armies marched, as cities rose and fell, as blood flowed through the streets of Jerusalem, and as the Jews wandered through the Middle East and Europe.  I also remember thinking that the Middle East had an incredible history that I needed to learn a lot more about.<br />Well, almost 30 years later, with a Masters Degree in Middle East Studies, with a couple of trips to the region under my belt, and with a job dealing with the Middle East, I can blame it all, at least in part, on reading &quot;The Source&quot; at age 12 or 13.  Seriously, though, I do believe that the seed of my life-long fascination with history, international relations, politics, and the Middle East was planted when I read &quot;The Source&quot; as a young teenager.  Actually, come to think of it, another Michener book -- Centennial -- got me fascinated in the history of the West and the American Indian, while several others made me want to learn more about South Africa, Hawaii, the South Pacific, the Chesapeake region, and even outer space.  So, definitely read James Michener, but be warned: you could become addicted to a lifetime of learning, travel, and adventure.	2004-06-21
US	49404909	R34BHKXGT9SM8I	0449214192	259930008	Centennial	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Summer reading at its best	It's a tossup between &quot;The Source&quot; and &quot;Centennial&quot; for my favorite James Michener book. While &quot;The Source&quot; got me really interested in the Middle East, &quot;Centennial&quot; turned my attention in a big way towards the American Indian and the West.  As I mentioned in my Amazon review of &quot;The Source,&quot; back in my early teens I thought that the length of a book somehow corresponded to its difficulty level, so I thought that if I could read a 1,000+ page book, then I must be REALLY smart and also grown up!  Anyway, the very first book I decided to read, based on these sophisticated criteria, was &quot;Centennial,&quot; by James Michener.  <br />I quickly (and happily) found out that the book was not hard to read at all, and also that it was fascinating and highly entertaining. I read it like I was watching a movie!  I strongly remember being completely engrossed as the centuries flew past, as lands rose and fell, as man came to North America, and eventually as the Indians and Europeans fought it out for control of the West.  I definitely remember that this was a very different perspective on American history vis-a-vis the Indians than I was getting from Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone on TV. <br />Some people have criticized James Michener for not being a particularly sophisticated writer, or the most elegant prose stylist ever.  Well, that may be, but Michener sure could collect a ton of information, he sure could spin a great yarn, and he sure could get you hooked on the topic at hand -- the American West, the Middle East, South Africa, Hawaii, outer space.  James Michener is summer reading at its (intelligent and entertaining) best.	2004-06-21
US	49404909	R3MVJ66Q5HSWMO	1931498482	459651462	Walking on Water: Reading, Writing, and Revolution	Books	5	25	27	N	N	What are you waiting for?	&quot;Walking on Water&quot; is filled with insight, wisdom, and humor by Derrick Jensen, one of the most important (although, sadly, not well known) thinkers, visionaries, and leaders of our time.  This is a fascinating book -- provocative, intriguing, informative, entertaining -- albeit a bit scattered at times.  Given what I know about Jensen (I have read several of his other books and belonged to his Yahoo discussion group for a while), my guess is that &quot;Walking on Water&quot; is a bit scattered because it is in part an interlude, almost a palate cleanser, for Jensen as he authors his next great &quot;Radical Environmentalist&quot; jeremiad.  <br />And what will THAT book be about?  Here's a hint: it's Derrick's third &quot;R&quot; after Reading and Writing.  Or how about the following quotes from &quot;Walking on Water&quot;: &quot;I hate industrial civilization...[it] is killing the planet&quot; and we need to &quot;change the whole system.&quot;   In other words, &quot;Walking on Water,&quot; while excellent in and of itself, is most likely something of a warmup for Jensen's &quot;bringing down civilization&quot; book -- the book that will represent the culmination of Jensen's thinking, activism, and life work to date (I can't wait!).<br />As a warmup, though, if indeed that's partly what it is, &quot;Walking on Water&quot; is important because it focuses on the critical role played by our &quot;industrial education&quot; system, and the damage that this system does to to our souls, our communities, and our ecosystems.  In other words, training people to think and act like unthinking, mindless, interchangeable parts coming off an assembly line may be a politically effective, cost-efficient way of holding together the industrial capitalist economic system. But, treating people like this is certainly not conducive to their well-being or to the well-being of the planet, which is being rapidly destroyed by human greed and stupidity even as we sit here. Thisis why Derrick Jensen's &quot;Walking on Water&quot; is important, because it attacks this system based on Jensen's tremendous knowledge and insight, his deep personal experience with the education system (and with fighting the worst of the capitalist system), and his skill, passion, and courage as a writer, thinker, and activist.  <br />At the risk of oversimplifying, what Jensen is (correctly) arguing and demonstrating here is that our education system is first and foremost designed to produce good worker bees for the capitalist economy, bees who will accept authority and &quot;won't question country, God, capitalism, science, economics, History, the rule of law&quot; or anything else, really.  In other words, bees that collect honey but don't sting.<br />What Jensen is also arguing --and showing, through his own leadership and life example -- is that it DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.  Thus, we see Jensen teaching (&quot;Principles of Thinking and Writing&quot;) in a very different way than most of us are accustomed to, both at an actual prison and also at a metaphorical one (a state university in Eastern Washington).  Some of the most interesting moments in the book are when Jensen collides with people who have obviously bought into the system to an extreme degree.  <br />For instance, who knew that arranging chairs in a circle could set off such strife (the &quot;Great Chalkboard War of 1995&quot;)? And who knew that encouraging students to think for themselves would lead one particular student, a fundamentalist Christian woman, to come to Jensen's office, to sit in his chair, to tell him he's &quot;going to hell&quot; (while taking &quot;a lot of people with [him]&quot;), and finally to drop down on her knees and start praying for him (as Jensen watches tensely to see if she's about to pull a gun on him).  Finally, who knew that one-third of college students, at least in one classroom at one university in America -- answer in all seriousness that they have no interest whatsoever in thinking at all (this does, of course, help explain how 40+% of Americans can continue to support George W. Bush)?<br />In the end, &quot;Walking on Water&quot; is both encouraging and depressing.  Encouraging because it demonstrates that it IS possible to help people break free of the mental straightjacket they have been placed in by the &quot;industrial education&quot; system.  Depressing because it highlights that there are perilously few Derrick Jensens out there, and because those few brave souls are fighting such a huge, powerful, rotten system.  As Jensen emphasizes through his words and actions, however, we must all fight for what we believe in while living our lives as if death is at our shoulder (which, of course, it is).  To quote the last words of Jensen's book: &quot;There is much work to be done.  What are you waiting for? It's time to begin.&quot;	2004-06-20
US	49404909	R2148EOQCUPE7U	0385721676	264457638	Oryx and Crake	Books	3	59	72	N	N	Doesn't quite cut the "mustchup"	Yes, I said \\"mustchup.\\"  See, I just invented a new word - in this case, a combination of \\"mustard\\" and \\"ketchup\\" (yum!) - just like Margaret Atwood does in her novel, \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"   Wasn't that fun?  OK, maybe not.   Well, then, how about some of Atwood's neologisms: wolvog (wolverine+dog); snat (snake+rat); rakunk (racoon+skunk); bobkitten (bocat+kitten); and of course the dreaded pigoon (pig+something or other)?  Do you find this whole exercise to be fun? clever? hilarious? thought provoking?  intriguing?  If \\"all of the above\\" is your answer, then it's highly likely you'll love \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"  If \\"goofy,\\" \\"weird,\\" \\"silly,\\" and even \\"pointless\\" are adjectives that spring to your mind, I'd strongly recommend that you read another book.<br />Personally, I have mixed feelings about \\"Oryx and Crake,\\" including the made-up words.  On the plus side, I thought the book was well written from a stylistic point of view.  Plain and simple, Margaret Atwood knows how to write, and that's no small thing when you think about all the godawful stuff that passes for fiction out there in our nation's bookstores.   Besides that, Atwood has an excellent, dark sense of humor, as in her fascinating \\"Blood and Roses\\" game, where the \\"Blood\\" side plays with human atrocities and the \\"Roses\\" side with human achievements.  Thus, we have \\"one Mona Lisa equaled Bergen-Belsen, one Armenian genocide equaled the Ninth Symphony plus three Great Pyramids...but there was room for haggling.\\"   As I said, Atwood's sense of humor is dark.  Besides style and humor, Atwood's certainly got something to say, with strong opinions about morality, bioethics, technology, power, society, human nature, sexuality, and much more.   Finally, Atwood has a talent for creating plausible scenarios, characters, and future worlds playing off of our own present.  In other words, Atwood's got all the makings of a fine science fiction writer.<br />So, with all those positives, why do I have mixed feelings about \\"Oryx and Crake?\\" Basically, because I feel that Atwood's talents are largely wasted here.  True, she's creative, but what's the point of this book?  Ultimately, it's hard to know; Atwood is frustratingly vague.  Just as importantly, why should we care about the world and characters Atwood creates, starting with the title characters, Oryx and Crake.  As far as Oryx is concerned, my feeling at the end of the book was, \\"goodbye Oryx, sorry I don't care very much, but frankly, I hardly knew ya!\\"  I mean, you'd think that the character whose name is listed first in the book's title would get a bit more fleshing out than the measly treatment Oryx receives in \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"  But, sadly, she doesn't.  After nearly 400 pages, I honestly couldn't tell you the most basic things about Oryx: who is she; where does she come from; what makes her tick; why should we care?  And yes, I had the same problem with Crake, the other character of the book's title. Unfortunately, these questions apply in many ways to the book as a whole:  what is this book all about; where does the world described here come from; what makes it all tick; why should we care?<br />Another problem with \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is that, while it's inventive on a certain level, it's really not very original or interesting.  At times, I found myself wondering if Atwood simply took bits and pieces from some of her favorite books and movies -- Blade Runner; Twelve Monkeys; The Island of Dr. Moreau; Gattaca; The Time Machine; Frankenstein, Brave New World - and spliced them together like the rakunks and snats populating the world of \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"   The problem is that, like pigoons and wolvogs, there's something artificial, uninteresting, and strangely cool/devoid of emotion about the synthetic creations, human and animal, that Margaret Atwood gives us in \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"   <br />Still, lest I completely slam \\"Oryx and Crake,\\" let me just end by stating that there is a lot of good material here, and I was glad I read it, frustrating though it was.  If you've read Atwood's fiction previously and are a fan, I would certainly recommend that you read \\"Oryx and Crake.\\"  If not, you might want to spend you r time reading something else in the dystopia/sci-fi genres, perhaps by Philip Dick, Alfred Bester, or HG Wells.  Now THOSE guys really cut the \\"mustchup!\\"	2004-06-17
US	49404909	R2U5OXNYBF87XR	0743260244	924900643	Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror	Books	4	15	21	N	N	A bit self centered, but riveting nonetheless	The (many) strengths and (very few) weaknesses of Richard Clarke's book, &quot;Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror,&quot; are evident from Chapter 1 (&quot;Evacuate the White House&quot;).  On the &quot;strength&quot; side, we've got the follwing: gripping; detailed; extremely knowledgeable; fascinating; insightful; and candid.  Also on the &quot;strength&quot; side of the equation, we've got a narrator who's obviously very bright, articulate, accomplished, competent, and professional.  Reading this book, the thought that kept springing to my mind is, &quot;thank god for Richard Clarke.&quot;  Or, alternately, &quot;if there was a huge crisis going on and I could only choose one person to be in charge of handling it, I would choose Richard Clarke in a heartbeat.&quot;   At least, I would choose the Richard Clarke as self-portrayed in this book.  <br />And there's the weakness of &quot;Against All Enemies&quot;: it's all Clarke, all the time, so you either find him: a) credible and not too self-serving (at least by Washington DC standards); or b) conceited, self-righteous, even insufferable.  Personally, I found Clarke to be some of both (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;), but overwhelmingly &quot;a.&quot;  Let's face facts; anyone who writes a memoir is going to try hard to make himself look good, unless h has a really low opinion of himself and a very small ego.  Something tells me that Clarke suffers from neither one of these problems!<br />So, what we have here, as the book's title declares, is an account of 9/11 and the years leading up to it from a true insider perspective.  But not just any insider; Richard Clarke is probably the foremost expert in the world on the subject he covers.  <br />Is Clarke perfect, neutral, unbiased?  Nope, he's human, and a very smart/competent/accomplished human to boot. As such, Clarke's got opinions, sometimes contrary to popular belief, sometimes exactly what you'd think.  For instance, that the Clinton Administration was actually pretty good when it came to dealing with terror is different than most people probably think.  Whatever you believe about this issue, I suggest that you read Clarke's account of events and make up your own mind.<br />On the Bush Administration, Clarke also has very strong opinions -- bound to enrage Bush partisans and thrill Bush opponents.  For instance, Clarke all but labels Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz as a complete nutcase (and not too bright, either), spouting bizarre and discredited conspiracy theories in which Saddam's behind everything but the common cold (hmmm...come to think of it!).  Dick Cheney comes off as simply frightening, in a Doctor Strangelove sort of way.  And George W. Bush comes off as someone not quite fully in charge of things, being subtly manipulated by the more intelligent, wily, clever, and powerful men around him.  Is this true or false?  Accurate reporting or partisan axe-grinding by Clarke?  Again, I suggest you read the book and make up your own mind.<br />In the end, though, what's really fascinating about this book is that it gives you a feel for events, a ringside seat at how things get done in the White House during a crisis, and, as importantly, during &quot;business as usual&quot; times too.  Whether or not you like Richard Clarke, what he gives us in &quot;Against All Enemies&quot; is a complete, fascinating, gripping, credible account of 9/11, the years leading up to it, and what we should be doing now to fight terror.  All in all, this is an important, historic book, if self-centered at times.  I strongly recommend it.	2004-06-14
US	49404909	R40UISUH505MR	0525946756	557461421	Skipping Towards Gomorrah: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America	Books	5	9	10	N	N	It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive?	Who knew that the 7 Deadly Sins could be so much fun?  Well, actually, they're NOT always so much fun, at least not the way Dan Savage describes them. And that's one of the things I really liked about this book:  it's brutally honest about these \\"sins,\\" the motivations behind them, and the people who pursue them in hopes of finding...fun? happiness? friendship? excitement?  meaning in life?  None or all of the above?  Perhaps these \\"sins\\" are more complex and less, well, \\"sinful\\" than some might think.  Perhaps it's not that eating or sex or gambling are good or bad in and of themselves, despite what the preachy moralists like Robert Bork (author of \\"Slouching Towards Gomorrah,\\" which Savage's title plays off of) and William J. Bennett (he of the not-so-little gambling problem himself) would have us believe.  Perhaps, Dan Savage suggests, it's more that any one of these activities has the potential to be good, bad, or indifferent.  It all depends.<br />Take gluttony, for instance. What, you might ask, could possibly be wrong about eating a giant piece of chocolate cake?  Sounds great to me, chocolate lover that I am!  But as the culmination of a humongous meal at a chain restaurant called \\"Claim Jumper,\\" the two huge hunks of greasy, gritty, cheap chocolate cake that Dan Savage and a friend each scarf down can only be described as surreal, bizarre, and worst of all, not much fun.  Actually, I would say that there's something pathetic and sad about the whole experience -- giant onion rings, giant glasses of water, giant roast chicken, giant order of ribs, etc.  Maybe this \\"sin\\" stuff ain't all it's cracked up to be?<br />A couple of chapters are truly memorable, including the one on \\"anger,\\" which centers on guns.  The title of the chapter, \\"My Piece, My Unit,\\" alludes to the strange, semi-sexual appeal that guns apparently have for some (many?) people.  Now THAT should be a sin! But the funniest thing about the chapter is that Dan Savage turns out to be quite a shot. Who knew that a liberal skinny gay guy from Seattle could be so good with guns, someone with a \\"gift\\" who could \\"learn to be a real marksman\\" with some practice (according to his instructor, Paul)?  So much for stereotypes!<br />Personally, I found the chapter on Greed (\\"The Thrill of Losing Money\\") to be one of the most interesting and insightful.  Are people who gamble sick, depraved sinners?  Are they greedy? Or are they just out to have a good time?  How about \\"none of the above\\" or \\"it depends?\\"  In just one of the insights that Dan Savage arrives at in his explorations, in this case he comes to the conclusion that \\"it's not about money, it's about risk and danger...and feeling alive.\\"  And to quote Bruce Springsteen (a bit out of context, but what the hell?), \\"it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive!\\"<br />Besides gluttony, anger, and greed, Dan Savage's other chapters cover the rest of the deadly sins (\\"lust,\\" \\"sloth,\\" \\"envy,\\" and \\"pride\\") more or less effectively and entertainingly.  And all throughout the book, Savage manages to, well, SAVAGE the finger-wagging hypocritical ultra-moralists out there in a bitingly funny way.  So funny, that you may commit the sin of Envy by the end of the book -- wishing you had Dan Savage's writing, journalistic and story-telling talents, that is.  On the other hand, if you are a finger-wagging hypocritical ultra-moralist, you might want to avoid reading this book altogether, because it will probably just make you angry.  And since we all know that anger's a sin, we certainly wouldn't want that!  Personally, I enjoyed spending a nice weekend reading Savage's book and not doing many of the chores I was supposed to be doing.  I believe that's called \\"sloth,\\" and that it's a sin.  Whoops!	2004-05-24
US	49404909	R3IW0NORZ5SKHJ	0679768114	351215412	The Future of Life	Books	5	35	37	N	N	Situation desperate but not completely hopeless	The Future Of Life is a great book and a perfect antidote to: a) unwarranted optimism about the state of the environment, which by almost any measure appears desperate; b) unwarranted pessimism or fatalism regarding man's ability to DO something about this situation; and c) the reams of misinformation, uninformed opinion, and ridiculously wild-eyed optimism on environmental matters that exists out there (i.e., \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\"). <br />Unlike The Skeptical Environmentalist, which is written by a statistician, The Future Of Life is written by one of the world's greatest living scientists, Edward O. Wilson, author of 20 books (including Sociobiology, and Consilience), winner of two Pulitzer prizes plus dozens of science prizes, and discoverer of hundreds of new species. Dr. Wilson is often called, for good reason, \\"the father of biodiversity.\\"  Wilson is also one of the rare breed of scientists, like Stephen J. Gould, Carl Sagan, and Stephen Hawking, who can actually communicate their thoughts and findings to the general public. This is particularly important when it comes to Wilson's area of expertise, given that the environment is something which affects all of us and which all of us can play a part in protecting (or destroying). <br />Wilson's main theme can be summed up as \\"situation desperate, but not hopeless.\\" Why desperate? Because humans--all 6 billion of them--are the most destructive force ever unleashed on Earth. According to Wilson, humanity's \\"bacterial\\" rate of growth during the 20th century, its short-sightedness, wasteful consumption patterns, general greed and rapaciousness, ignorance, and technological power have resulted in a mass extinction: \\"species of plants and animals...disappearing a hundred or more times faster than before the coming of humanity,\\" and with \\"as many as half...gone by the end of the century.\\" Americans in particular are an environmental disaster, consuming so many resources (oil, meat, timber, etc.) per person that, according to Wilson's calculations, \\"for every person in the world to reach present U.S. levels of consumption with existing technology would require four more planet Earths.\\" Well, we don't have four more planet Earths, and at the present time, we are well on our way to trashing the one we've got. In short, Wilson concludes after chronicling the sorry, depressing, nauseating history of man's mass slaughter and destruction of the environment, our species richly deserves the label: \\"Homo sapiens, serial killer of the biosphere.'' <br />Given all this, how can I say that Wilson's book is not hopeless? First, because human population growth is slowing (finally!), as women gain education, careers, and power over their reproductive choices. Luckily, when given this choice, women increasingly have opted for \\"quality over quantity,\\" and average family size has plummeted. In most advanced industrialized nations, in fact, fertility rates have now fallen below replacement level (2.1 children per woman), meaning that populations in those countries will actually start to decline (barring immigration) in coming years. Wilson points that the worldwide average number of children per woman fell from 4.3 in 1960 to 2.6 in 2000. This is still far too high, and still means years more of absolute human population growth, but it's at least a bit of hope amidst the environmental carnage and constant drumbeat of bad news. <br />Second, there is some hope because many humans do love the environment and want to preserve and protect it. Here, Wilson uses the fancy, scientific-sounding term \\"biophilia\\" to describe man's \\"innate tendency to focus upon life and lifelike forms, and in some instances to affiliate with them emotionally.'' In this instance, I believe Wilson may be overly optimistic. When confronted with the choice of a Big Mac or an acre of rainforest, let's say, most people appear to choose the Big Mac. Or when given a choice of driving their gas-guzzling SUVs and living in sprawling suburbia vs. driving smaller cars, living in cities, taking mass transit, and helping to prevent disastrous global warming, most people choose the SUVs and suburbia. Still, much of this is undoubtedly a result of ignorance and skewed economics (i.e., billions of dollars per year in government subsidies doled out to agriculture, fossil fuel production, wasteful water usage, among other things), and these can be corrected--at least in theory. Also, there are undoubtedly millions of humans who strongly care about the environment--whether for aesthetic, religious, ethical, \\"biophiliac,\\" or other reasons--and are volunteering, donating money, or altering consumption patterns in order to help save it. <br />This brings us to the third reason for not losing all hope: humans have the ability to save the environment, and Wilson lays out a clear, realistic, step-by-step plan for doing so. Ironically, one of the very characteristics of environment which causes it to be so vulnerable --its concentration of biological diversity in a small areas (\\"hotspots\\") --means that it is possible to target that land and save it. Wilson estimates that biological \\"hotspots\\" cover \\"less than 2 percent of the Earth's land surface and [serve] as the exclusive home of nearly half its plant and animal species.\\" In Wilson's calculations, those \\"hotspots\\" can be saved \\"by a single investment of roughly $30 billion.\\" Just to put this in perspective, the U.S. gross domestic product is over $10 trillion, or more than thirty times the $30 billion needed to save the \\"hotspots.\\" <br />The Future Of Life ends on a note of cautious optimism: although right now we find ourselves in a \\"bottleneck of overpopulation and wasteful consumption,\\" Wilson believes that the race between \\"technoscientific forces that are destroying the living environment\\" and \\"those that can be harnessed to save it\\" can be won. In order for this to come to pass, however, humanity needs to take action immediately along the lines that Wilson lays out. Ultimately, The Future Of Life is a passionate, brilliant, clarion call to arms by a great scientist, and a great man as well. If we don't hear Wilson's call, we will have only ourselves to blame. And whichever way things turn out, we can't say we weren't warned.	2004-05-23
US	49404909	R33W1Z7Y93OYA0	1400034639	467724921	War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning	Books	5	13	14	N	N	War is a drug, and humans are addicted	There are many standard answers to the question, \\"why do people go to war\\": economics; ethnic/religious differences; conflicts between radically different secular ideologies or simply factions of the same ideology; political science theory; \\"Hegelian forces;\\" etc.  These are all interesting, but ultimately unfulfilling on some level.  The question still lingers, why do people have to actually GO TO WAR over land, or religion, or whatever? Why can't we work it out peacefully? Why can't we all just get along? <br />To all these questions, NY Times war correspondent Chris Hedges -- in his book, \\"War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning\\" -- proposes some disturbing answers. To boil it down to its core argument, what Hedges is saying is that war is so common and durable across time, space, and dimension because, perversely, and in spite of its horrors, war actually can be highly addictive and alluring, at least as powerful as heroin or sex, but far more destructive. <br />According to Hedges, war appears to be almost hardwired into our species' DNA. Hedges particularly points to the force labeled by Sigmund Freud as \\"Thanatos,\\" the urge to destroy, to kill, and to die.  In addition to Thanatos, there's also that other powerful driving force for humans, what Freud calls \\"Eros\\" -- the urge to love, to fornicate, to procreate, to build. War, in Hedges' view, is exciting and alluring, bringing people of a particular nation together and uniting them in a heroic, mythical way that covers up differences and alone-ness. The combination of Eros and Thanatos results in what is, essentially, an addiction, a rush, an all-consuming high. War, like love (or sex), is a drug, and humans are most definitively addicted. <br />Hedges argues persuasively that war, \\"even with its destructiveness and carnage... can give us purpose, meaning, a reason for living,\\" has the power to obscure the \\"shallowness and vapidness of...our lives.\\" Unfortunately, as Hedges points out, this \\"meaning\\" and \\"reasonfor living\\" come at the expense of a few many other important things -- individuality, truth, memory, and \\"honest inquiry,\\" among others. And as if that's not bad enough, Hedges also notes (correctly) that war perverts language and culture, warps perception and social norms, and \\"breaks down long-established prohibitions against violence, destruction, and murder.\\" <br />Sadly, despite all of its obvious flaws (as seen in the cold, dispassionate light of day), war -- not unlike a powerful narcotic such as heroin -- has amazing staying power. Hedges himself, a man who has seen more than his share of horrors, states that even now, ''There is a part of me -- maybe it is a part of many of us -- that decided at certain moments that I would rather die like this than go back to the routine of life.\\" <br />How could ordinary life be so terrible, so dull, so empty, that war could seem a desirable alternative? Perhaps it has to do with another one of Hedges' main themes, that war -- as depicted in countless war movies -- is highly sexualized, even eroticized (\\"There is in wartime a nearly universal preoccupation with sexual liaisons\\"). Sex in war is not, however, a healthy expression of sexuality by any standards (recall the Rape of Nanking). In fact, Hedges views the combination of sex and war as nothing better than \\"necrophilia...[wiping] out all delicacy and tenderness\\" and leaving in its place \\"a frenetic lust that seeks...to replicate or augment the drug of war\\" (Abu Ghraib prison photos spring to mind).<br />This is all strong and depressing stuff, and Hedges offers only the barest glimmer of hope. Specifically, Hedges argues that when people actually EXPERIENCE war (\\"rotting flesh,\\" \\"cries of agony,\\" \\"froth-corrupted lungs,\\" \\"blood and entrails seeping out of bodies\\") for long enough, they sometimes begin to realize that war isn't what it was cracked up to be. Eventually, there comes a point when all the killing and destruction becomes routine and boring, and then people sometimes tire of war. It is at that point that the chance exists for the myths to be exposed for the lies that they always were, after all. <br />Are there flaws in Hedges' otherwise excellent book? Well, sure, the evidence presented here is mainly anecdotal, based on Hedges' own particular experiences regarding war, and is by no means a systematic study of war across history and cultures. This raises the question: is it possible that Hedges' analysis is not applicable to all war, but just to certain types? This would harm the universality of Hedges' argument. A lesser critique is that Hedges doesn't offer us any practical advice stemming from his observations and analysis. Specifically, it would be helpful to hear from Hedges whether he is against any war at any time, or whether some wars (e.g., World War II) might be justified.<br />Despite its (minor) flaws, though, this is an excellent book which I highly and wholeheartedly recommend.	2004-05-23

Those were two questions that kept recurring as I read Bush at War by Bob Woodward. Simply put, something doesn't jibe here. Why would the super-secretive, hyper-political, control-freak Bush White House grant this kind of access to Bob Woodward of all people? It doesn't make much sense. Or does it? Well, maybe it does if we think for a minute about who stood to gain and who stood to lose by having such a book published. <br />For starters, how about George W. Bush, shown here to be (pick several or all of the following): firm, resolute, tough, courageous, compassionate, concerned (with humanitarian issues in Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iraq, for instance), engaged, secure enough to surround himself with strong people, and even possessing that elusive trait in the Bush family -- the \\"vision thing,\\" as his father called it. Wow, this guy could be the next Abraham Lincoln if he's even half this good! <br />But don't reserve the space on Mount Rushmore quite yet. How do we know any, or even most, of this book is true? Well, we don't. In fact, all we've really got is our trust -- or lack thereof -- in Bob Woodward. We certainly don't have any footnotes, critical voices, or even any analysis to speak of. And that's where things start falling apart. In a book like this, at least for those of us not favorably inclined towards George W. Bush, we need more than blind faith in a reporter. All that does is raise our suspicions even further. And Bob Woodward just doesn't give us what we need. <br />Speaking of the author, why did the White House choose Bob Woodward, of all people, to produce this \\"Profiles in Courage\\" piece? Why not just get some Republican hack from Fox News -- Roger Ailes would have been glad to supply one (along with his own confidential advice on how to run the war, etc.) -- to do the job? Was Woodward chosen because he has enough credibility built up over the years so that the story might actually be semi-believable? Woodward's not telling. <br />Anyway, having chosen Bob Woodward, for whatever reason, to tell the story of Bush at War\\" (also known as \\"how George W. Bush saved freedom, truth, and the American way\\"), we really have no idea whether or not the Chosen One (Woodward) was: 1) independent and objective in his reporting here; 2) manipulated by Ari Fleischer and friends; 3) simply a conduit for the story the Bush White House wanted him (and the public) to hear; or 4) some combination of \\"all of the above?\\" Almost certainly #4 is the correct and final answer, but who knows for sure? <br />Another major problem with Bush at War is that \\"you don't know what you don't know,\\" and all we've got to go on here is what the White House -- via its messenger-boy Bob Woodward -- provides us. And sorry Bob, but that's just not sufficient. I mean, seriously, why should we believe anything coming out of this White House: the same hyper-political, control-freak, super-secretive bunch that won't release records of who the Cheney energy task force met with, that has set up a secret group in the Pentagon (headed by convicted felon John Poindexter, no less) to spy on us, that has launched a frontal assault on the Freedom of Information Act, and that has locked up thousands of people without trial or due process? And now we are supposed to trust the Bush White House, to believe, for example, that slimy, smarmy Karl Rove (who comments admiringly at one point how an enthusiastic Yankees stadium reception for Bush was just like \\"being at a Nazi rally\\"), really had absolutely nothing to do with the Bush administration's decisions after 9/11? Does anyone out over the age of 10 there really buy this? Well, Bob Woodward -- the experienced, cynical, hardened, veteran Washington reporter -- apparently does. Again, what's going on here? <br />Maybe the most interesting thing here is that, in spite of all its propaganda efforts with Bob Woodward, the Bush Administration \\"A Team\\" (Powell, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Rice, etc.) really doesn't end up looking that great in \\"Bush at War.\\" Don Rumsfeld in particular comes off as aloof, obsessive, irritable, and a weird control freak. Dick Cheney comes off somewhat better, although inscrutable, but still bearing a creepy resemblance to Dr. Strangelove. Colin Powell is depicted as on the margins, constantly doubting whether things will work, but basically always holding to his role as the loyal soldier. As a whole, the \\"A Team\\" -- at least as depicted here -- actually is not the smooth-functioning, well-oiled machine that Rove et al. would like us to believe it is. In fact, for most of the book these wise men and women seem to be almost completely \\"making it up as they went\\" along, hoping for a lucky break. <br />You've got to hand it to George W. Bush. He may not be very smart. He may not be very compassionate. He may not have \\"the vision thing.\\" But he's certainly very lucky. And whether we like it or not, we could be stuck with Mr. Lucky for another four years.	2004-05-23
US	49404909	RQO8MECMTNURO	074325337X	760100886	House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties	Books	4	37	46	N	N	Read the book, then take a long hot shower!	As I waded through the muck described so well by Craig Unger in &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud,&quot; I kept thinking, &quot;must take hot shower, must take it now!&quot;  Sadly, though, after 281 pages of slimy &quot;good ol' boys&quot; and corruption run amok; of crony capitalism gone hog wild; of stupidity and short-sightedness (failing to foresee the &quot;blowback&quot; from creating an army of Muslim fanatics in Afghanistan); of immorality (providing Saddam Hussein with biological agents, including &quot;tissue that was infested with bubonic plague&quot;), incompetence (letting relatives of Osama bin Laden leave the country after 9/11 without even interviewing them), and mendacity (linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11, while pretending that Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with it); I concluded that a hot shower would not be nearly sufficient to cleanse the moral and political stench from my nostrils.  Just the cover photo alone (not to mention the one of Don Rumsfeld shaking Saddam Hussein's hand) smells bad enough to knock a buzzard off the proverbial pile of you-know-what.  <br />Sound like a fun book?  Well, no, it's not.  But it IS an important and well-written book, as well as an entertaining one, in a twisted sort of way.  Is &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud&quot; perfect?  Far from it. For one thing, it's not that original -- lots of this material is already known (although Unger skillfully pulls it all together).  More importantly, it's too focused on links between the Bush and Saud families for my tastes.  The problem with personalizing things is that it runs the risk of missing broader issues and forces at work; in this case, America's addiction to oil and the country's long-standing relationship (starting with Franklin Roosevelt) to the corrupt, violent, oil-rich, fundamentalist, theocratic monarchy known as Saudi Arabia.  I'm certainly no fan of the Bush family, but in my opinion Unger overreaches when he implies that President Bush essentially hasdivided loyalties -- between Saudi Arabia and  America.  If that's the case, then so did Jimmy Carter (&quot;the Carter doctrine&quot; springs to mind), Ronald Reagan (the sale of AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia in 1981), Bush #41 (his &quot;buddy&quot; relationship with Saudi Prince Bandar), and Bill Clinton (failing to punish the Saudis for their failure to cooperate in the Khobar Towers bombing investigation).<br />The bottom line is that our problem is not with any particular individual or family, it's with America's insatiable appetite for Saudi oil, and our unwillingness to cut that dependency even after 9/11.  Let's face it, the Saudis are not our friends, and they do not share our values.  Among other problems, the Saudis have used some of the billions in oil money we've sent them over the years in order to fund Islamic fundamentalist schools (&quot;madrasas&quot;) across the world, not to mention fundamentalist Islamic groups (including terrorists).  <br />So what the heck are we doing dealing with these people?  Three words: oil, oil, oil.  Given that fact, it's not exactly a big surprise that a Texas oil family like the Bushes would have close ties with the Saudi (r)oil family.  The problem is not the Bush-Saudi friendship per se, but the overall thrust of U.S. foreign policy, driven by the desire for cheap oil (and other resources), regardless of the nasty regimes we have to do business with in order to get it.  The answer, then, is to get off of imported oil once and for all.  When that happens, the Bush-Saudi relationship will be irrelevant, while the Saudi royal family, along with its oil and influence on U.S. foreign policy, will fade like a mirage into the country's desert sands...	2004-05-20
US	49404909	R21SCCE0OZUI2	8445070339	960180750	1: El Senor De Los Anillos / the Lord of the Rings: LA Comunidad Del Anillo (Spanish Edition)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Great book; Spanish translation a little clunky at times	Let me just start by declaring my belief that JRR Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the greatest works of fiction -- not just fantasy, but ALL fiction -- ever.  And I've read a lot of fiction in my life!  Still, the main question here is whether or not the Spanish language translation does the original English book justice.  Unfortunately, I'd have to say that from that perspective, &quot;El Senor de los Anillos&quot; has some serious problems.  <br />The main problem is probably inherent to ANY translation of Tolkien from English into another language.  Professor Tolkien, as a great student of language, chose his words, accents, and dialects extremely carefully.  Unfortunately, many of these choices, such as Sam's working class speech patterns (&quot;coneys,&quot; &quot;Gaffer,&quot; and all his many idiosyncratic sayings and references), or the Orcs rough (Cockney?) accents, just don't really come across in Spanish.  I have found the same thing in other translations, such as when I read &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; in French back in High School.  Same deal.  <br />In addition, however, I also caught numerous instances of outright errors in &quot;El Senor de los Anillos,&quot; which in the case of Tolkien and his care for such things, are truly egregious.  For instance, on numerous occasions the translator said &quot;East&quot; when he meant &quot;West&quot; or vice versa.  Not good, especially when these directions are fraught with meaning in Tolkien's conception of Middle Earth.  Less egregiously, I found some of the literal translations -- &quot;Bolson&quot; for &quot;Baggins&quot; or &quot;Comarca&quot; for &quot;Shire&quot; simply to be annoying.  Why translate proper names?  Must be a translator thing; I just don't understand!<br />Finally, a problem both with translation into other languages as well as into film is the loss of much of Tolkien's poetry.  In the case of the blockbuster movie trilogy, poetry was kept to a minimum in favor of a predictable (heavy) emphasis on action, action, and more ACTION!  In the Spanish translation, the problem is that the rhyming schemes which Tolkien uses, which are critical (in my humble opinion) to a true appreciation and enjoyment of the poems, are basically demolished.  Maybe it wouldn't matter so much with other authors, but again, in the case of Tolkien, where each word choice is given tremendous thought and care, alteration of rhyming patterns can only lessen the impact of what Tolkien is getting at and the sheer beauty of his poetry.<br />Having said all this, despite the frustrations mentioned above, I enjoyed reading Lord of the Rings in Spanish, which I mainly undertook as part of my studies of the language.  Reading a familiar book in another language is not a bad way to improve your vocabulary and general command of that language.  Still, I would love to see a translation of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; that comes without the sloppy errors and that rings truer in spirit to the original.	2004-05-18
US	49404909	R3DO4RSI6T2OZW	041596928X	200142486	Bruce Springsteen: Two Hearts, the Story	Books	4	23	25	N	N	Excellent, but not enough new material after 1986	First off, the positives.  1) Dave Marsh is an excellent writer who clearly loves his subject -- Bruce Springsteen -- and is great at bringing the concerts to life;  2) Springsteen himself is a fascinating figure, almost too good to be true (except that he's not!); 3) Many of Bruce's songs are brilliant, and Marsh does an excellent job exploring the themes -- life, death, movement, stasis, hope, despair, love, loneliness/alienation, faith, emptiness -- that run like a river through them all; 4) Despite obviously loving Springsteen and his music, Marsh rarely if ever sinks into the hero worship and &quot;hagiography&quot; he has been incorrectly accused of.<br />Now, the negatives.  The book claims to be &quot;The Definitive Biography, 1972-2003,&quot; yet it barely covers anything after 1986.  Hey, that's 18 years ago; has so little happened in Bruce's life and music since then?  In addition, I found the book to be a little repetitive at times, particularly in the introductory sections.  But the most important criticism I've got is that, with the exception of &quot;The Rising,&quot; the book largely ignores Springsteen's post-&quot;Born in the USA&quot; career:  &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; &quot;Lucky Town,&quot; &quot;Human Touch,&quot; &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&quot;  These are all basically glossed over in a rushed, short, final couple of chapters.  As much as I hate to say it, this makes me suspect that the publication of &quot;Two Hearts,&quot; and its release just in time for the Christmas shopping season 2003, was in large part an excuse (by Dave Marsh?) to make a few bucks and to cash in on the post-&quot;Rising&quot; surge of interest in Springsteen.  OK, sure, this IS America and it IS a MARKET economy, but I thought the whole book was about how Springsteen -- and by extension, Dave Marsh, his #1 fan and biographer -- only put something out there in the marketplace when it was ready from an ARTISTIC point of view.  From that perspective, this book, which is really two previous books plus one quickie update covering 1987-2003, wasn't quite ready.  Still, it's great for what it is, and Bruce Springsteen truly is an American hero worth emulating.  At the least, it made me run to my stereo to listen to &quot;Nebraska,&quot; &quot;Live 1975-1985,&quot; and the rest with a heightened awareness of what it's all about.  Bruce Springsteen truly is one of the greatest American artists ever; a national treasure to be listened to, appreciated, and savored, not the least in these difficult, dangerous, and frightening times.hich is really two previous books plus one quickie update covering 1987-2003, wasn't quite ready.

On the one hand, it's kind of neat seeing a teenager writing a book and getting it published.  On the other hand, it's not \\"neat\\" if it's a BAD book originally published by the kid's PARENTS, for god's sake!  I agree with most of the 1-star and 2-star reviewers here, and will not repeat their points about how derivative, formulaic, uncreative, and frankly, embarrassing this book is.<br />I would just add that Eragon is an incredibly obvious -- and cynical -- attempt by Knopf to cash in on the Lord of the Rings phenomenon. Let's see, \\"Eragon\\"/\\"Aragorn\\", \\"The Spire\\"/\\"The Shire\\", a stone that can't be damaged when struck by a sword/a ring that can't be damaged when thrown in the fire or struck by a sword, elves/elves, dragons/dragons, etc. etc.  Yawn.<br />Unfortunately, Christopher Paolini is no JRR Tolkien, by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, Tokien is probably rolling over in his grave right about now. Still, I will be curious to see what, if anything Paolini comes up with in the future.  Right now, I've got to say I am NOT optimistic.	2003-12-28
US	49404909	R17BL25EGBWI4P	1893956253	776902536	Listening to the Land: Conversations about Nature, Culture and Eros (29 Interviews)	Books	5	47	56	N	N	Everyone should be listening to Derrick Jensen!	If there were any justice in the world, Derrick Jensen's book,  \\"Listening to the Land, \\" would be a best seller, the hot book being read and talked about by just about everyone.  In such a world, what would - just for example - President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and other \\"drill, cut and burn\\" true believers think of this book?  One guess? They'd probably arrest Jensen under the USA Patriot Act and have the book burned on a pile of old-growth firewood!  How about all these big-shot CEOs now on their way to jail (hopefully) for corporate wrongdoing?  They'd probably try to figure out how to coopt Jensen into their corporate advertising about how \\"green\\" they are!   Don't forget the Catholic Church bishops, who shuffled pedophile priests around and protected them from any reprimand over the years; they'd probably say that Jensen and his friends are all just a bunch of nature-worshipping atheist witches!  And let's not let good ol' average \\"middle Americans\\" off the hook either, since it's their consumption and waste (which apparently knows no bounds), their actions, and their apathy, which allow a few powerful people, companies, and governments to trash the planet, the poor, and the vulnerable (both human and non-human) for their own power and profit.  <br />Unfortunately, in this far-from-just world of ours, most people -certainly not our political or corporate leaders -- have never even HEARD of Derrick Jensen, let alone read \\"Listening to the Land.\\"  And, also unfortunately, most of these people would probably just dismiss Derrick Jensen and friends as a bunch of \\"tree-hugging, left-wing, anti-establishment nutcases.\\"   Well, given the level of violence, destruction, and mass extinction humans are currently wreaking on our planet, I'll take the \\"tree-hugging anti-establishment nutcases\\" over Bush, the corporate CEOs, the Catholic bishops, and the SUV-driving American suburbanites -- any day of the week!<br />What Derrick Jensen has courageously done here is tobring together around 30 leading theologians, environmentalists, Native American philosophers, psychologists, techno-skeptics and others in a fascinating series of interviews (\\"conversations\\" really) which provide a much-needed fresh perspective while bringing to bear tremendous energy, passion and focus on some of our biggest and most urgent problems.  These people may care passionately about things, but they're definitely not a bunch of wackos.  In fact, the more you read, the more you realize it's OUR SOCIETY that's wacko, not the \\"tree huggers.\\"<br />Jensen is excellent at asking penetrating question and getting his subjects to speak their minds, although at times I wish I could have heard more of his voice as well (have to read his other books, I guess).  By the end of \\"Listening to the Land,\\" the level of thoughtfulness, eloquence, compassion, and wisdom found here fills us with understanding, sadness, righteous anger, and a sense that the world as it is currently constituted is just not right.   Specifically, Jensen shows us how a lack of connection and harmony within the human soul itself - a result in large part of organized religion's teachings regarding man's \\"specialness,\\" separation from all other works of creation (i.e., nature), and hence \\"dominion over the Earth\\" -- has bred a potentially fatal disease for both humans and non-humans.  Jensen's conversations also make clear that something must be done about this situation immediately, and it ain't drilling in the Arctic or blowing the tops off of mountains in West Virginia (as the Bushies would have us believe), I'll tell you that!  <br />If, after reading \\"Listening to the Land,\\" you don't feel at all angry, disturbed, or upset, perhaps you're a corporate CEO or the White House Press Spokesman or something.  For the rest of us, though, many of whom care about both our own lives as well as the world around us, this book is indispensable and deeply moving.   I couldn't recommend \\"Listening to the Land\\" more strongly to anyone who cares about the world they live in.  I admire and commend Derrick Jensen for his honest and powerful work; and I greatly look forward to reading his other books!	2002-08-30
US	49404909	R2RN1EWLJ1H8LW	0679767819	664674670	The Demolished Man	Books	5	3	7	N	N	Four, sir; three, sir; two sir; one -- go and get this book!	\\"The Demolished Man\\" by Alfred Bester won the first-ever Hugo Award, and it's obvious why it did.  Extremely well written in a cyber-punk/comic book style, this book was revolutionary when it appeared in the 1950s, and remains fresh 50 years later.  Fascinating idea, executed with style and panache, this book ranks up there among the best science fiction books ever, and a must read for anyone who likes that genre.  Amazing.  Still, having said that, I have to agree with another reviewer who points out that this is NOT Bester's best book, and that just about everything done so well in \\"The Demolished Man\\" is done even better in Bester's all-time classic, \\"The Stars My Destination.\\" <br />As usual, Bester explores themes of power, the human mind, personal freedom and privacy (in a world where telepaths can read your thoughts and where crimes can be detected before they happen), politics, high and low society, money, the nature of truth and reality, sanity, and the grayness of morality.  All this is even more impressive given that the book was written during the paranoid, good vs. evil, democracy vs. communism, Joe McCarthy red-baiting 1950s.  In fact, \\"The Demolished Man\\" can be read on one level as a clever commentary on/\\"demolition\\" of that strange decade.  As in \\"The Stars My Destination,\\" Bester writes in a highly entertaining, creative, and unique way, with unexpected - and often subtle - humor, plays on words and language in general, and song lyrics which are guaranteed to drive any telepath far away from your thoughts (\\"Tenser, said the Tensor.  Tension, apprehension, and dissension have begun.\\").<br />This is not a perfect book, with obvious flaws in the plot and a somewhat contrived ending, but these are relatively minor problems.  Overall, this is a work of soaring imagination and style, and I highly recommend it to everyone.   So, go out and get this book, before the countdown ends - \\"Four, sir; three, sir; two sir; one!\\"	2002-08-11
US	49404909	R3RITEVMSJ21B8	0812930991	150767402	Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative	Books	5	17	25	N	N	No excuse for being "blinded by the right"	So, Hillary Clinton was right after all:  there WAS a vast right-wing conspiracy out to destroy her husband's presidency.  What we've got here, in David Brock's \\"Blinded by the Right,\\" is the inside story on how the conspiracy worked, who funded it, and the lengths to which it was willing to go in order to achieve its goals.  As convincingly portrayed by Brock, these people (Richard Mellon Scaife, Jerry Falwell, Ann Coulter, Matt Drudge, etc., etc.) are downright frightening:  virulently homophobic, vicious, sleazy, lying, nasty, and fascistic are just a few of the adjectives that spring to mind.  And these are just the inside members of the conspiracy.  What's possibly even scarier is the millions of ordinary Americans who BELIEVED (and still believe) this hateful, spiteful garbage heap of lies.  I'm referring particularly to the \\"dittoheads\\" (those who have loaned out their brains to Rush Limbaugh) and to all those afficionados of the most outrageous claims regarding Bill Clinton (that he was a murderer, drug dealer, etc.).  We all know someone like that -- at work, in our families, at church, wherever.<br />And now, essentially, due to a questionable-at-best \\"victory\\" in the 2000 Presidential election, these same people are now running the country.  Brock lays it all out for the reader in his book, and nobody has denied what he has to say.  The thought that these anti-democratic, right-wing extremists (John Ashcroft, Dick Cheney, and their ilk) are now in charge of this country is not a pleasant one, to put it mildly.  If you don't understand why, you desperately need to read David Brock's book.  Even if you DO understand, in fact, you still should read Brock's book, just to get the full flavor of what the right-wing agenda is all about and how it works.<br />I've only got three significant criticisms of this book.  First, there's no appendix, which is frustrating.  Second, David Brock is not a sympathetic character for the vast majority of the book (still, Brock's assertions ring true, and also have not been refuted by anyone).  Finally, this book is unpleasant to read -- it could (and should) make you sick to your stomach.  As portrayed by Brock, the vast right wing conspiracy is far from harmless; it did a great deal of damage to our country and continues to do so.  But, after reading David Brock's book, at least none of us can pretend we don't know the \\"lunatic fringe\\" is out there, or that we must fight it.  In other words, after reading David Brock's courageous and timely book, none of us have any excuse for being \\"blinded by the right.\\"  Thank you, David Brock, for finding your conscience at long last!	2002-07-11
US	49404909	R3GMLM5XW2CDGN	0465083560	123213530	The Age Of Terror	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Provocative, informative, entertaining book on 9/11	This collection of essays--written, compiled, and published within just a few weeks of 9/11-- easily could have fallen into the trap of being just another slap-dash, knee-jerk, sloppily-put-together \\"instant book.\\"  And, as with any collection of essays by different authors, The Age of Terror: America and the World After September 11 could have ended up being wildly uneven in terms of quality, theme, and style.  Fortunately, none of this happened.  Instead, the book's two editors - former Clinton Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Nayan Chanda-have assembled a fine collection of essays by leading experts in various fields (history, law, political science, molecular biology, diplomacy) into a top-notch, thought provoking, fascinating look at the world after 9/11.  As explained on the book's jacket, the premise here is that \\"the unforgivable is not necessarily incomprehensible or inexplicable.\\"  After reading this book, the events of 9/11 should be both more comprehensible and more explicable to just about any reader.<br />Among the more provocative essays in The Age of Terror\\" is the one by Charles Hill, a former aide to Secretaries of State Kissinger, Haig, and Shultz.   Hill's chapter, entitled \\"A Herculean Task:  The Myth and Reality of Arab Terrorism,\\" demolishes what Hill considers to be a series of \\"deceptive and dangerous myths\\" that have sprung up following 9/11: that \\"America faces an entirely new kind of challenge;\\" that \\"we brought this on ourselves;\\" that there are \\"legitimate grievances about poverty and oppression\\" that \\"leave those afflicted with no choice but to take up terrorism;\\" and that \\"nothing we do can be effective against such a threat.\\"    Even more provocatively, Hill blasts \\"the miserable state of politics and governance\\" in the Arab world, plus the tendency of Arabs to blame all their problems on warped conspiracy theories (i.e, the Mossad was behind 9/11) and bluntly states: \\"Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure. Not one has proved able to provide its people with realistic hope for a free and prosperous future.\\"  On the contrary, Hill argues that Arab regimes have intentionally served up a \\"combination of internal oppression and propaganda to generate rage against external enemies.\\"  In this soil, according to Hill, \\" religiously inflamed terrorists take root\\" and thrive.  Hill then concludes his fascinating, thought-provoking essay with a classic literary analogy, comparing the current fight against terrorism to the \\"twelve labors of Hercules.\\" And just as Hercules required \\"intelligence,\\" \\"patience,\\" \\"fortitude\\" \\"the willingness and ability to undertake diverse and difficult tasks,\\" \\"methods other than direct, main force\\" at times; the assistance of allies, and continued respect for \\"properly constituted laws and procedures of justice\\" to successfully complete his labors, so shall we in our current struggle.  Hill leaves us with fighting words fit for Hercules: \\"those who commit acts of war will be warred upon until they surrender or die.\\"<br />[....]<br />Paul Kennedy's essay, \\"Maintaining American Power:  From Injury to Recovery,\\" to this reviewer's mind is somewhat repetitive of earlier arguments he has made, particularly in his best-known book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.  Kennedy stumbles early on when he states unequivocally that 9/11 has led \\"not just to short-term, military responses...but also to a re-examination of many aspects of the American way of life, of America's attitude toward other countries.\\"   Huh?  It has?  Where?  Not in the Bush Administration, that's for sure!  After that, Kennedy hits his stride, arguing forcefully (as he has in the past) that the U.S. needs to utilize and strengthen all of the elements of its power: military/industrial, economic, and diplomatic.  Kennedy sharply criticizes the Bush Administration's strong tendency towards unilateralism and apparent disrespect for international organizations and alliances, whilearguing for an essentially realpolitik \\"smart diplomacy.\\"  Finally, Kennedy warns of the \\"danger of overreaction and overextension\\" to the \\"dreadful and unjustified shock\\" of 9/11, and prophecizes that the U.S. may find that the 21st century is \\"even more tricky to navigate, and even more turbulent, than...the century just gone.\\"<br />Aside from the Hill, Ferguson, and Kennedy essays, other chapters in The Age of Terror ably cover such topics as: the role of science (and strengthening America's scientific base) in the post-9/11 world (Maxine Singer); flaws in U.S. foreign policy--inconsistency, insensitivity, unilateralism once again--that need fixing if we are to fight the asymmetric threat of terrorism (John Lewis Gaddis); the rise of Islamic extremism and fundamentalism--\\"salafiyyah,\\" Wahhabism-- in the Arab world and \\"its roots in the history of the Muslim sense of decline and its unhappy encounter with the dominant West;\\" (Abbas Amanat); the need to maintain our \\"most fundamental values,\\" such as civil liberties and open debate of issues, while fighting terror (Harold Hongju Koh); and the need for improved intelligence and homeland security while learning as a society how to \\"live with terrorism\\" (Paul Bracken).  In sum, if you want to understand why 9/11 happened and where we might go from here, I strongly recommend that you read this excellent, well-written, thought-provoking book.	2002-06-15
US	49404909	R11TDA5S8ZUZKD	0743202120	692090769	War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals	Books	4	0	1	N	N	U.S. foreign policy (or the lack thereof) after the Cold War	\\"War in a Time of Peace\\" is an excellent, detailed, \\"bottom-up\\" account of U.S. foreign policy (or, more frequently, the absence of one) since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall.  As the Pulitzer-prize-winning author, David Halberstam, depicts in his latest book, the end of the 40+ year Cold War led not to a new commitment to internationalism, to responsibility as the sole world superpower still standing, to enlightened engagement with the rest of the world, but instead to quasi-isolationism (the standard American instinct at the end of just about every war it has ever fought), a shirking of responsibility, and a lack of coherent foreign policy vision, both under the first President Bush as well as under President Clinton.  The combination of a general cluelessness and lack of concern by most Americans about foreign events, an obsession with domestic trivialities and distractions (i.e., OJ Simpson, Monica Lewinsky) the rise of TV \\"news\\" (using the term extremely loosely), and the steep decline in coverage of foreign events, except in the rare case when the pictures were so dramatic they just had to be shown, ultimately resulted in tragic consequences --  for the Somalis, the Bosnians, the Rwandans, the Afghans, and (as the events of 9/11 may indicate) even the United States itself.    As military historian Robert Kagan said, \\"if you are the president of the United States, you do not find trouble, trouble finds you.\\"   \\"War in a Time of Peace\\" is largely the story of how trouble has found every occupant of the Oval Office during the 1990s (and now the 2000s), and also how sticking your head in the sand accomplishes nothing but leaving a certain part of your anatomy exposed (and vulnerable).<br />Given the lack of an overarching foreign policy paradigm to replace the Cold War, Halberstam focuses heavily on how personalities and domestic political considerations played the most important role in US involvement (or lack thereof) overseas during the 1990s.   Halberstam continually emphasizes the importance of personalty, character, experience, and ability over the \\"forces of history\\" or even ideology.  By Halberstam's standards, Richard Holbrooke comes off well, Madeleine Albright pretty badly, and Bill Clinton as a huge disappointment in the end.  The first President Bush comes off as an extremely capable, decent man, but one strangely reluctant to take credit for his accomplishments, and also not a natural politician in our mass media/TV age.   Ultimately, Bush couldn't get himself to believe that Americans would, in the end, really reject him, with his accomplishments and integrity, especially on foreign policy, for someone like Bill Clinton - a small-time governor with nothing like Bush's resume.  But, the first President Bush was never trusted by the right wing of his party, and didn't help matters by breaking his \\"read my lips, no new taxes\\" pledge.  Then, he allowed Pat Buchanan to dominate the 1992 Republican convention with a speech that, Halberstam points out, was one of the ugliest ever delivered at a national political convention (\\"better in its original German,\\" as the joke goes).  And, he underestimated Clinton's \\"I feel your pain\\" appeal to the America of Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera.<br />Another theme running through Halberstam's book is that perceived \\"disasters\\" of the past - Vietnam, Somalia (or as Richard Holbrooke calls it, \\"Vietmalia\\") - can often lead to inaction and even disaster - Bosnia, Rwanda - in the present.  Drawing the wrong lessons from past experiences, or fighting the last war, or adapting too slowly to changes in technology (i.e., \\"smart bombs,\\" \\"stealth\\" aircraft) are eternal problems, as Halberstam illustrates over and over again.  And the constant concern with the latest poll ratings doesn't help matters either.  One telling example is Bill Clinton, following the fall of Srebrenica and the massacre of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs - as bad as World War II, President Chirac of France put it - flying into a rage, NOT over the horrible events themselves, but because \\"I'm getting creamed\\" politically!<br />Overall, \\"War in a Time of Peace\\" is an excellent book, whose main flaws are: 1) it's too focused on personality; 2) it's too long and can get repetitive at times; and, more importantly, 3) it doesn't provide enough of an intellectual framework, or a more \\"macro\\" perspective, to put into context the post-Cold-War world, and the attempt to build a \\"new world order.\\"  Still, this is an excellent, fascinating book, and is highly relevant if for no other reason than it provides insight into some of the main players in the current Bush administration as, since 9/11, they confront the greatest international relations challenge of their lives.  Let's just hope that, at the least, the top players in the Bush foreign policy team don't -- as many have done before them -- draw the wrong lessons from history.	2002-02-19
US	49404909	R1SYSNR1MSFQLK	0465016146	406165084	The Mystery Of Capital Why Capitalism Succeeds In The West And Fails Everywhere Else	Books	4	21	24	N	N	Excellent, but doesn't completely solve the "mystery"	In \\"The Mystery of Capital,\\" Hernando de Soto presents a fascinating, powerful, and relatively simple (but far-reaching) thesis that, to the extent it is correct, and to the extent that it is listened to by political and economic elites, could have enormous potential for affecting positive change throughout the world.   The thesis, in sum, is that the key to creating wealth is turning \\"dead\\" capital into \\"live\\" capital by guaranteeing property rights, and even more broadly than that, the \\"right to property rights.\\"  To the extent that this is done, according to de Soto, good things begin to flow, as they have in much of the Western world (the prime example being the United States).  To the extent that this is NOT done, as is the case in most of the \\"Third World\\" (usually referred to, inaccurately, as the \\"developing\\" world - inaccurate because the vast majority of this world is manifestly failing to develop!), good things will NOT flow, and the country will remain mired in poverty no matter how rich it might be in raw materials, a stable political system, beautiful beaches, or a benign climate.  The issue is that, without secure property rights and a legal system which facilitates capital mobility and \\"fungibility,\\" poor people (otherwise known as budding entrepreneurs, or as de Soto argues \\"the solution,\\" not \\"the problem\\") will not be able to access their accumulated assets in a way that would \\"capitalize\\" those assets, which then could be used to generate further wealth.   Thus, millions of people will remain mired in poverty, despite sitting on POTENTIALLY huge assets (trillions of dollars worth according to de Soto's estimates) and regardless of how hard they might work (and I definitely don't believe that people in the \\"Third World\\" are inherently \\"lazier\\" than in the \\"developed\\" world!). <br />Overall, I find it difficult to disagree outright with most of what de Soto has to say, but as I read his book I did feel somewhat uneasy at times.  Perhaps this is because I tend to be naturally suspicious of monocausal, oversimplified explanations for highly complex problems.  More importantly, while I believe that de Soto has most likely identified a NECESSARY condition for rapid capitalist development, I continue to have doubts as to whether or not this condition alone is a SUFFICIENT one for development at all.  I also worry that this book will be misread or misused by some, who will say \\"see, all we need the government for is to guarantee property rights, then get the hell out of the way, and everything will be great.\\"  While I don't believe this is what de Soto is arguing, his omission of such critically important issues as the place and role of women (a cultural issue?), the role of serious diseases like AIDS, the problem of severe environmental degradation, the prevalence of illiteracy and the lack of education in general in much of the world, overpopulation, etc., implies that de Soto doesn't see these as serious obstacles (or complicating factors) to economic development.  One could argue just as strongly as de Soto does in his book, it seems to me, that there is a strong, direct, positive correlation between women's education levels, lower birth rates, and economic development, and that the key to \\"Third World\\" economic development, therefore, is making sure that women are well-educated, healthy, and political empowered.  <br />Anyway, the point is that while de Soto is definitely on to something very important in \\"The Mystery of Capital,\\" he has not told the whole story or completely solved the \\"mystery\\" - not even close!  One other quibble with the book is that, unfortunately, it's just not very well written - repetitive, didactic, tedious at times, and just plain too long (de Soto's argument probably could be made just as strongly, or more so, in 30 or 40 pages, as opposed to 230 pages).  Still, on balance this is an important book, and I definitely recommend it, at the very least for provoking serious thought (andmaybe even action) on a problem that, to many people, continues to be just an inscrutable \\"mystery.\\"	2002-02-02

Undoubtedly, Kurt Cobain was an amazing, original, musical genius, leader of (arguably) the greatest band of the past two (three?) decades.  Also undoubtedly, Kurt Cobain was an extremely complex person, chock-full of apparent contradictions: emotionally wounded yet strong in many ways; magnetic yet simultaneously pushing people away; sensitive yet angry, even violent at times; ambitious yet hell-bent on self destruction; etc.  In the end, Kurt Cobain was a wildly talented yet deeply disturbed human being who ended up blowing his brains out at the age of 27, despite having achieved everything he ever wanted: physical escape from his miserable upbringing, broken family, and dying hometown; fame and fortune in the world of music; a beautiful, loving wife; a healthy, normal child.  The questions for any biographer of Kurt Cobain, then, are: 1) where did he (and his music) come from; 2) how did he become the leader of one of the greatest rock bands ever; and 3) what went wrong/why did he kill himself?  <br />Charles Cross, in \\"Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain,\\" takes a stab at all those questions, and almost manages to answer them - but not quite.  In the end, despite the author's prodigious amount of research, numerous interviews with key people who knew Cobain, access to Cobain's journals, and a straightforward writing style that avoids succumbing to the usual star-struck biographer syndrome, I cannot say that I truly understand Kurt Cobain.  Is that the fault of the biographer, the reader, both, or neither?  I don't know, but I've got to say that I found it frustrating to read hundreds of often difficult, even depressing and painful, pages on Kurt Cobain and STILL not really understand: 1) how on earth did Kurt Cobain, starting from where he did, come to create such brilliant, beautiful, terrifying, amazing music; and 2) what exactly was WRONG with him?  <br />Admittedly, the first question may be close to unanswerable, as it is really asking \\"what isgenius, and where does it come from?\\"  Who knows!  On the second question, it's just astonishing to me that Kurt Cobain never really appears to have received an adequate diagnosis of - and treatment for -- his physical and mental problems.  Instead, what we have is Cobain \\"self-medicating\\" with alcohol, acid, and heroin, in a futile (and self-destructive) attempt to stop the terrible pain (stomach and otherwise) he was in.  <br />In sum, what do we make of a person who, in his early teens, predicts that ''I'm going to be a superstar musician, kill myself and go out in a flame of glory,\\" then goes out and does just that?  \\"Heavier than Heaven\\" provides us with a good start at an answer, but ultimately doesn't solve this - or many other -mysteries surrounding Kurt Cobain.  Perhaps nobody ever will...	2002-01-05
US	49404909	R31B391PZT1D18	0060933267	325559010	The Ethics of Star Trek	Books	5	9	11	N	N	To paraphrase Mr. Spock, this book is �fascinating!�	This book is for everyone who loves Star Trek for more than just its cool special effects, its hot alien babes, or even its sparkling intergalactic political intrigue.  In other words, this book is for the serious (or casual) Star Trek fan who loves the show first and foremost because it embodies the ideals of its creator, Gene Roddenberry.  And what are those ideals?  Well, as the title, \\"The Ethics of Star Trek,\\" would suggest, for one thing they're highly ETHICAL!  But what is meant by the word \\"ethical\\" exactly, what does this have to do with Star Trek, and how does it fit in with the major philosophical schools of thought?  Interested?  Well, then, you've got to read this book!<br />In my opinion, what makes \\"The Ethics of Star Trek\\" so effective, more so in many ways than a straight philosophy textbook, is that the authors are able to make philosophy come to life in a fun way without \\"dumbing it down.\\"  How do they do this?  Mainly by taking particular episodes and characters from Star Trek over the years, and then subjecting them to a serious philosophical analysis.   For instance, the authors examine the actions and thoughts of Commander Benjamin Sisko in the Deep Space Nine episode, \\"In the Pale Moonlight,\\" to examine utilitarianism (\\"the greatest good for the greatest number\\") and existentialism (the \\"angst\\" of free choice).  Two \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" episodes - \\"Ethics\\" and \\"I, Borg\\" - are used to illustrate the difference between Kant's three kinds of actions (those inconsistent with duty, those in accordance with duty, and those \\"from\\" duty).  From all this, and much more, we see strains of Aristotelian virtue, Kantian morality, existentialism, and Platonic virtue running throughout the Star Trek series.  We also see some basic values expressed:  the ends does not always justify the means; rational beings should always be treated as ends in and of themselves; it is important to follow duty over desire, and altruism over egoism; and one must consider both the intentions AND the consequences of an action in evaluating its morality.<br />In sum, \\"The Ethics of Star Trek\\" is an enthralling, engaging, entertaining, enlightening book which takes both philosophy and Star Trek seriously.  This is a great book for those of us with some knowledge of philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Jean-Paul Sartre, but who could perhaps use a refresher course.  \\"The Ethics of Star Trek\\" also would be a great primer for those of us who may not remember anything about Scottish philosopher W.D. Ross, and his six categories of prima facie duties, or Tom Regan and his \\"duty-based ethics,\\" but are interested to learn!  \\"The Ethics of Star Trek\\" covers the basics of all these philosophers, and more, and then applies them to Star Trek.  As Mr. Spock might say, \\"fascinating!\\"	2001-12-29

What is one to make of \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist?\\"  Is it true, as the author claims, that pretty much EVERYTHING is getting better in the world (although &quot;not necessarily good&quot;), and that the whole environmental &quot;litany,&quot; as he calls it, is a bunch of marketing/fund-raising propaganda?  Is it true, as Lomborg claims, for instance, that (to take just a few): 1) the world overpopulation &quot;problem,&quot; if it ever WAS a problem, is basically solved at this point; 2) that income inequality is lessening and human welfare is improving basically everywhere and in every way (although, Lomborg admits, not as fast as he would like); 3) that global warming is not much of a problem, and certainly not one worth wrecking our economy over; 4) that the rainforest is not being destroyed (well, at least not rapidly); 5) that species are not going extinct at a rate even close to what environmentalists claim; 6) that we're not \\"running out of energy\\" (or other resources); and 7) that the only reason people are so \\"scared\\" about these so-called \\"problems\\" is that environmental groups constantly (and cynically) pound away with their exaggerated \\"Litany\\" of doom, which the media loves to pass along as its \\"horror story of the week\\") because this type of news apparently attracts readers/viewers?<br />My take on &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist?&quot;  Interestingly, for the first few chapters, I found the book to be refreshing, honest, and &quot;skeptical,&quot; if not especially profound or original.  But as chapter after chapter went by, and I realized that the author was just making the SAME EXACT ARGUMENT (\\"don't worry, things are basically not so bad and they're getting better fast!\\") over and over again in the SAME EXACT WAY (go through the \\"Litany\\" point by point and argue the exact opposite), I started to get increasingly suspicious -- not to mention increasingly bored!  Especially since each chapter tackles a highly complex topic (i.e., petroleum geology, demography, global climate modeling, forestry, hydrology, chemistry, agriculture, developmental economics), each one of which would seem to require a lifetime of study to master.  <br />Here's an example.  On the issue of biodiversity, an extremely complex subject, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; argues that the rate of species extinction has been wildly exaggerated.  Now, this certainly MAY (in theory) be the case, but how can Professor Lomborg KNOW this with such certainty?  I mean, scientists who specialize in this subject don't even have a clue how MANY species there are, let alone how many have disappeared and are currently endangered.  And by the way, if there are 20 members of a species left in zoos, and perhaps a few more in the wild, does that mean that they're still not \\"extinct,\\" and is that supposed to be a good thing?!?.  Having personally visited rainforests in places like Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Peru, all I can say is that I saw with my own eyes how much pressure (from logging, mineral exploitation, agriculture, pollution, and population pressures) is being exerted on these amazing places (and their inhabitants).  Are these places really threatened?  Do we want to protect these places for future generations or not?  Do they have intrinsic, not just economic, value?  &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; would seem to imply that the answer is &quot;no&quot; to each of these questions.<br />In sum, I believe that &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is neither truly &quot;skeptical&quot; nor &quot;environmentalist.&quot;  And despite the thousands of footnotes and convoluted statistics, this book does NOT do what it claims to do, namely present the &quot;real state of the world,&quot; just the &quot;state of the world according to Professor Bjorn Lomborg.&quot;	2001-12-27

Jack Germond;  Uh, umm, well, uh, thank you all for your support.  John:  OK, exit question!

Mor-ton: Well, you know, I really had several things to say on the Middle East situation, and I also had some neat predictions to make this week about the current budget negotiations, but I guess since Jack's book seems to be the main topic of discussion this week, I'll just hold off for now and give it an 8.  John:  Eleanor!!  Eleanor:  This book is great!  Jack Germond has more knowledge of politics in his right pinky than you have in your entire body, John!!!  And his comments on this show are right on..I'd give it a 9 and a half.<BR>John:  Pat!  Pat Buchanan:  As a lifelong professional  politician, who has never held a real job, I've got to say that I think Jack's book is very insightful.  I mean, this guy obviously LOVES politics and politicians, conservative and liberal alike, and it's great fun to read about YOU, John!.  Anyway, I guess if Jack weren't an atheist, I'd give his book a 10, but since he doesn't believe in God and also engages in all kinds of drinking, womanizing, and cursing, it saddens me to say that I'll have to give it a lower rating, probably a 5 for his moral relativism. John:  Jack, why don't you rate your own book?Jack: Well, uh, umm, John, do you think I'm an idiot or  something?  Of course I'm going to give my own book a 10!  Anyway, it's going to make me enough money so that I can tell you to take a hike!! John:  OK, now that we've gotten all the incorrect answers out of the way, let me give you the correct answer.  If you forget about his comments about me and my show, Jack's book is a 10.  But since I am obviously the center of the universe, the book is a big ZERO! Eleanor:  You see John, I knew you couldn't be unbiased! Mor-ton:  Can we talk about the budget negotiations now? Pat:  I'm off to run for President. Jack:  Let me out of this loony bin!!!	2001-12-05

One reason for this attention now is the catchy title, which seems to offer relatively easy-to-comprehend answers to questions on peoples' minds like: \\"why do they hate us so much\\" and \\"is this just an isolated incident or part of a broader phenomenon?\\"  And, to a large extent, Barber succeeds in providing answers (or at least in asking the right questions), in neither a \\"dumbed-down\\" fashion nor a too-theoretical-for-anyone-but-political-scientists style.  In sum, \\"Jihad vs. McWorld,\\" is an important, timely, serious book that is also highly readable. <br />What does \\"Jihad vs. McWorld\\" have to say?  Well...a LOT, and far too much for any Amazon.com review!  So, I'll just try to summarize a few of Barber's main points.<br />First, let's start with \\"Jihad.\\"  As Barber employs it in his book, \\"Jihad\\" is not specific to Islam or even to terrorism, but instead is used as a metaphor for the \\"anti-Western, anti-universalist\\" struggle against \\"McWorld\\" (I'll get to that one in a minute).   Although it's interesting that, at the moment, most of the opposition to \\"McWorld\\" appears to be coming from the Muslim world, \\"Jihad\\" as Barber uses it is not specific to Islam, but exists everywhere, including the American &quot;heartland.&quot;   Thus, in Barber's view, Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, Aryan Nations, \\"militias,\\" and Al Qaeda are all manifestations of the same anti-modern, anti-cosmopolitan, anti-democratic phenomenon, and in a way are natural allies (except that - luckily -- they detest each other more than they detest \\"McWorld\\").  Jihad is not just for extremists, though, but for any group of people that sees \\"McWorld\\" (correctly) as a threat -- to their common identity, to their sense of belonging, to their \\"elementary justice and morals,\\" to human dignity, to tradition, etc.  Unfortunately, though, Jihad is fatally flawed (anti-democratic, narrow, provincial, exclusivist, even racist) in Barber's view.  And, in the end, it's probably doomed to defeat by \\"McWorld\\" anyway (as the Borg in Star Trek would say, \\"resistance is futile!\\"), although in the short-run it can do a great deal of damage (i.e., September 11).<br />OK, so what about \\"McWorld?\\"  Barber spends most of his time building the case against (and then bashing away at) \\"McWorld,\\" which is what he appears to know best, since of course that's the world he lives in.  Plus, it's so EASY to bash \\"McWorld,\\" and in a way it would almost be fun if it weren't so serious (and malignant).  Thus, Barber takes aim at:  fast food, Hollywood, MTV (sex, violence, misogyny, consumerism, glorification of youth), Disney (\\"a cultural Chernobyl\\"), malls, suburbia, consumerism, materialism, technology and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism run amok, among other things.  All easy targets, almost like shooting fish in a barrel, and it's been done by many other authors (see &quot;Fast Food Nation,&quot; &quot;Suburban Nation,&quot; &quot;Technopoly,&quot; &quot;Bowling Alone,&quot; etc., etc.), but Barber generally does an excellent job at describing &quot;McWorld&quot; - and trashing it!   Barber's weightiest criticism of &quot;McWorld&quot; is that it is an anti-democratic, totalitarian system that leads to all kinds of bad outcomes, not the least of which is reducing us all to mere consumers (as opposed to citizens, for instance).  <br />Ultimately, though, Barber's book really isn't so much McWorld vs JIHAD as McWorld vs, democracy, the &quot;common good,&quot; and civil society (the &quot;domain of citizens&quot; which mediates &quot;between private markets and big government&quot;).  Barber presents the values of democracy (slow, active, engaged, requiring education, valuing words, ideas, patience, and an informed, mature citizenry concerned with some &quot;higher good&quot;) as directly antithetical to those of &quot;McWorld&quot; (fast, mindless, impatient, image-driven, impulsive, infantile, &quot;gimme, gimme, gimme!&quot;).  Barber pushes his argument a little too far and too hard here, in my opinion, with little real proof that democracy is dying, and even less that it is dying BECAUSE of &quot;McWorld's&quot; depredations.  Still, it's interesting stuff, and personally I think there's a lot of truth here.<br />In the end, Barber concludes that the only way to effectively fight Jihad and McWorld is by promoting and nurturing democracy and civil society.   Barber believes that we could - theoretically at least -- use institutions already in place (the state, international organizations and legal frameworks) to do so.  Sadly, though, Barber believes that at the moment the necessary institutions are either non-existent or have been severely weakened.  So, having laid out both the world's bleak alternatives at the moment (Jihad, McWorld) as well as the possible solutions (democracy, civil society), Barber in the end comes out as basically a pessimist.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean he's wrong; after September 11, we can only wish that he were!	2001-12-03

Feist, Terry Pratchett, Charles de Lint, George R. R. Martin, and more	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Uneven but enjoyable	As with any collection of writings (in this case, essays), \\"Meditations on Middle-earth\\" varies widely in style, theme, effectiveness, and overall quality.  So it's no surprise that (for me at least) some of these essays work much better than others.  In fact, I would have to say that a couple pretty much never captured my interest.  It was also a little off-putting to me, at least initially, to know that this book was published as an obvious commercial tie-in to the movie.  I hate commercial tie-ins!  But, such is life, I guess, in our capitalist society, so what can you do?  These caveats notwithstanding, I have to say that, overall, I enjoyed this book very much.  Most of the writers do a good job in describing their own personal experience of Tolkien/\\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and several are truly outstanding.  I particularly liked Michael Swanwick on various Tolkien themes -- integrity, truth, honesty, sadness, life/actions as having real consequences - as well as his view of \\"the true purpose of the Ring-quest\\" as a \\"test of all creation.\\"  Orson Scott Card has some interesting points to make on \\"escapist\\" vs. \\"serious\\" reading, on who the REAL hero of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was (hint: not Frodo), and most importantly on the \\"wild,\\" \\"untamable\\" nature of all great tales, including Tolkien's.  Ursula Le Guin does an excellent job analyzing Tolkien's prose style (using the chapter 8 in Volume 1, \\"Fog on the Barrow Downs\\"), his rhythmic patterns, and his \\"'trochaic' alternation of stress and relief\\" throughout his saga.   Terri Windling writes a hair-raising essay on good and evil, fantasy and reality, and her own escape from a truly horrific childhood and an evil stepfather, in part thanks to Tolkien.<br />In sum, \\"Meditations on Middle-earth\\" is a very good, albeit uneven, collection of essays on one of the great authors (JRR Tolkien) and books (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\") of all time.  If you're into Tolkien, you should definitely like this book, and if you've neverread Tolkien, then this book might make you curious to do so.  Either way, you can't go too wrong reading and thinking about \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"	2001-11-28

In spite of the fact that it's too long by a couple hundred pages, can get somewhat convoluted, and meanders at times, \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\" is overall a fine, fine book, filled - just like the comic books it celebrates -- with good guys and bad guys, heroes and villains, life and death struggles, and several larger-than-life characters (with even a superhero or two thrown in for good measure).<br />The author of \\"Kavalier and Clay,\\" Michael Chabon, is an amazing young writer, in love with language, and you can tell that he's also in love with this subject and themes (see below), this place (mainly New York City), this time (mainly just before and after America's entry into World War II), these characters (Kavalier, Clay, and many others), and really this whole book!  It's tough not to get caught up in Chabon's enthusiasm, and in the end it's hard to really criticize him for the book's excesses and (minor) flaws.  Especially since this is not just a bunch of &quot;brain candy&quot; as some have contended, but is filled with weighty (and worthy) themes such as: freedom vs. bondage (of society's strictures, for instance); fantasy/illusion vs. reality; integrity/honesty vs. self-deception/\\"living a lie;\\" sanity vs. \\"craziness;\\" courage vs. cowardice; and commitment (to a cause, a person, or an idea) vs. escapism.  Throw in anti-Semitism (the threat of Nazism and Hitler runs throughout much of the book), homophobia, McCarthyism (which was at least in part about homophobia), American culture and changing cultural mores, the role of art and the artist, and more (including the Amazing Golem of Prague), and you've got enough meat here to feed several hungry superheroes!  <br />And, despite all his \\"meaty\\" material, Chabon never lets \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\" get ponderous, didactic, or too heavy.  In fact, one might say that this book is as easy and enjoyable to read as a top-notch comic book, even as it rises to the level of highart (as if an excellent comic book can't be a fine work of art - hah!).  In sum, I loved this book, strongly recommend it, and congratulate Michael Chabon for his creation (and well-deserved awards).	2001-11-10

Unlike most of the &quot;history&quot; we were force-fed in school, &quot;Founding Brothers&quot; is an example of how history SHOULD be taught - or told.  What Joseph Ellis does in this amazing, elegant, thought-provoking, well-written, fascinating, and highly enjoyable book, is (among other things): 1) to bring history to life without \\"dumbing it down\\" in the least; 2) as Ellis states in his preface, \\"to render human and accessible that generation of political leaders customarily deified and capitalized as Founding Fathers;&quot; 3) to show how many of the ideological (i.e., Federalism vs. \\"States rights\\") and sectional (i.e., North/South) conflicts which are still with us today were right there at the beginning; 4) to show how none of this was &quot;inevitable&quot; or &quot;predetermined;&quot; and 5) to depict the many ways in which personalities and relationships can sometimes trump \\"ideology\\" - and vice versa.  In other words, Joseph Ellis has packed a tremendous amount of knowledge, wisdom, and erudition into this relatively short (248 pages) book.  <br />It's difficult to pick the high point in such a wonderful, amazing book as this, but if I had to choose, I'd say that Ellis' chapter (\\"The Friendship\\") on the complex relationship between two of the most important \\"Founding Brothers\\" (John Adams and Thomas Jefferson) was the best -- absolutely fascinating.  Ellis' description and analysis of the 50-year history between these two men - opposites in so many ways, yet with so much in common as \\"founding brothers\\" - is in and of itself worth the price of  \\"Founding Brothers.\\"  And, luckily for historians like Ellis, there is a voluminous correspondence between Adams and Jefferson, with the added bonus that both men were great writers in their own unique ways. <br />Personally, I found Ellis' portrait of John Adams to be the most interesting (and sympathetic) in the book, with Adams' sometimes-friend, sometimes-enemy Thomas Jefferson a notch behind.   As portrayed by Ellis, Adams seems to me the most human of all these \\"Founding Brothers,\\" the most down-to-earth, the most emotional, the most intellectually honest, the most irreverent, the least aristocratic, the most self-aware, and - ultimately - the most accessible and real.  <br />Ellis' portrait of Thomas Jefferson also is fascinating, with Jefferson overall coming off pretty badly.  Among other things, Ellis shows Jefferson to be: deceitful, dishonest (even with himself), duplicitous, \\"compartmentalized,\\" hypocritical, and even borderline treasonous - at least by today's standards.  Plus, Ellis points out several major cases where Jefferson just totally got things wrong (i.e., that the future was with Revolutionary France, not with Britain, which he believed was in terminal decline...uh, not!), in contrast to Adams, whose judgments more often than not were perceptive, nuanced, visionary, and - importantly - correct.  And yet, as Ellis shows, it is Jefferson who more often than Adams has come across as the great hero (as THE author of the Declaration of Independence, and whose Presidency was capped off by the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the country in one fell swoop) in American history, and Adams knew it (and resented it) throughout his life.  As Adams wrote, &quot;Jefferson ran away with the stage effect and all the glory of it.&quot;  Of course, John Adams is in the midst of his own current resurrection, while Jefferson has suffered some blows to his reputation in recent years, so maybe things didn't turn out so badly after all for Adams!<br />In sum, Joseph Ellis richly deserves all the accolades, awards, attention, and book sales which \\"Founding Brothers\\" has brought him.  Hey, anyone who can make history interesting to millions of Americans raised on a thin gruel of rote memorization, boring textbooks, and stale portraits of dead mythological quasi-deities, (see James Loewen's &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot;) has got to be doing something right!  This is a great book, by a great historian, and - despite Ellis' recent difficulties with the truth in relation to his OWN history - that's no lie!!	2001-10-20

With the movie version of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" opening in only a few weeks, and also as the first year of the 21st century winds down, there is no better time than right now to look back on one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) authors of the 20th century - JRR Tolkien.  And Tom Shippey, like Tolkien a professor of Old English and medieval literature, is well qualified to guide us in our examination of Tolkien and his work.<br />In \\"Author of the Century,\\" Tom Shippey strongly (and correctly, in my opinion) defends \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as a modern masterpiece, filled with great wisdom on such topics as: good vs. evil; Boethianism vs. Manichaeanism (read the book if you're curious what these concepts are all about!); right vs. wrong; free will vs. determinism; \\"chance\\" vs. \\"fate;\\" traditionalism/traditional values vs. modernity/modernism;\\"reality\\" vs. \\"fantasy;\\" \\"truth\\" vs. \\"myth;\\" nature vs. industrial society; the past vs. the future; and much more.  What comes out of all this is that Tolkien was at heart a strong traditionalist, anti-modern (and anti-modernism), even a \\"reactionary\\" in some ways (i.e., his love for the monarchy).  And yet his books appealed to the 60s counterculture...go figure!<br />On the other hand, maybe it's not so surprising that Tolkien appealed to the counterculture, which, like Tolkien, yearned for a lost sense of mystery, where things were not all leveled out (i.e., suburbia, fast food), dumbed down (i.e., TV, most popular literature), and just plain dull (i.e., most jobs).  So, although \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is overwhelmingly tragic and deeply sad, there's purpose, meaning, and beauty in Tolkien...  and poetry...and magic!  In other words, much that is missing from modern life.<br />Besides pushing Tolkien as the \\"Author of the Century\\" (and Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as one of the greatest books ever written) and explaining Tolkien's major themes, Tom Shippey's book also strongly defends the dying academic field ofphilology (Tolkien's specialty), which looks at the roots, structure, and real meaning of language.  Along these lines, Shippey provides numerous examples of Tolkien's extensive research into (and knowledge of) ancient languages, words, and stories.  Shippey provides voluminous evidence that Tolkien was an extremely talented philologist.  For instance, Tolkien was capable of inventing - and actually DID invent -- whole new languages (i.e., Quenya and Sindarin, based loosely on Finnish and Welsh).  On top of this, Shippey points out that Tolkien also was a great storyteller and a fine writer, without which \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" would not have achieved such popular success.  <br />In sum, I suppose it's POSSIBLE that Tolkien might only rank as the second or third greatest author of the century.   Nah!  I agree wholeheartedly with Tom Shippey --  Tolkien  ranks #1 in the 20th, or any, century!	2001-10-11

Although I personally don't have ADD, I know many people who do (or who I suspect do!), which is why I decided to read this book.  Having said that, I found \\"Out of the Fog\\" to be very helpful in understanding what is surely one of the most misunderstood, disrespected, scoffed-at, psychological disorders in the world today.  Is ADD overdiagnosed?  It's possible.  Is Ritalin overprescribed?  Again, it's possible.  Does any of this mean that ADD is any less real or painful for people who suffer from it.  Uh...that is DEFINITELY NOT possible.  Unfortunately, what all the misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding ADD appears to do is, if anything, just make people who truly DO suffer from it just feel WORSE about themselves (i.e., \\"I must just be lazy, stupid, crazy\\" etc.).  Then, on top of ADD, the next thing you know the person feels depressed and anxious on top of everything else.  Great...  Given all this, Kevin R. Murphy has done a service to everyone - ADD and non-ADD alike - by demystifying this neurobiological condition and making it clear that: a) ADD is a REAL thing, not some invention or conspiracy by drug manufacturers and middle school principals; b) ADD has REAL consequences - psychic, economic, social - that shouldn't be brushed off; and c) ADD is not just for kids anymore - it doesn't just disappear when you reach age 18 or 21 or whatever!<br />\\"Out of the Fog\\" is written by someone who clearly is qualified and who knows what he's talking about.  This is clearly important, since there is so much disinformation and media hype out there about ADD.  The book is well organized (no disorganization -- ADD induced or otherwise -- here!), well written, engaging, and useful, in terms of \\"demystifying\\" and diagnosing ADD, treating it (medication combined with counseling and lifestyle changes seems to be the best bet), and lastly &quot;outmaneuvering&quot; it (very important there currently is no &quot;cure&quot; for ADD, only treatments).  All in all, I strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to understand or deal with ADD (or someone they know who has ADD).	2001-10-05

Read this!	This book, though published in 1985 and therefore not dealing directly with the Taliban or Osama bin Laden, remains a valuable (especially now!) study of Islamic fundamentalism.   The author, R. Hrair Dekmejian, looks at the history, social-psychological roots, ideology and practice, motives and goals, of Islamic fundamentalist movements in the Arab world.  Among the more interesting parts of the book are the author's profile of fundamentalist psychology (alienation, dogmatism, inferiority-superiority, activism-aggressiveness, authoritarianism, intolerance, paranoia-projectivity, conspiratorial outlook, idealism-sense of duty, etc.) and the bases for Islamic revivalism (misrule, class conflict, military impotence, modernization and culture crisis, and identity crisis).  <br />The author also examines specific Islamic fundamentalist groups in the Arab world, the potential consequences of Islamic fundamentalism, and &quot;Islamic Fundamentalism and U.S. Interests.&quot;  Despite being more than 15 years old, &quot;Islam in Revolution&quot; could not be more timely today.

For what were those attacks but the start of a war on America by those who hate our values and all that we stand for? Interestingly, as we prepare to go to war to defend our values (both good and bad), here are two books that look unflinchingly at some of the darker, less savory sides of America, and some of the dark, unsavory values that they reflect. It is also important to note that fast food, as one of the most visible symbols of American \\"culture\\" as it goes global, is one of those things which people worldwide both love -- and hate with a passion -- about America.<br />So, what is so bad about fast food, you might ask? It's cheap and tastes good, right? Well, after reading Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" the question might be better asked: what ISN'T bad about fast food? Let's see, here's something which is: 1) bad for your health (hert disease, E Coli); 2) bad for the environment (large-scale pollution caused by factory farming, for instance); 3) bad for workers (low pay, terrible and dangerous working conditions, degrading, virulently anti-union); 4) bad for cultural diversity (a few huge corporations take over America, wiping out local color and uniqueness in the process); 5) bad for our communities (contributing to suburban sprawl, blighting our landscape); 6) bad for our politics (as these companies pour money into politicians, overwhelmingly right-wing, who will do their bidding on a whole host of issues, including direct and indirect subsidies from you, the taxpayer, to them, the rich corporation); and 7) bad for the animals raised and slaughtered inhumanely. Besides that, what's not to like? Oh yeah, it's only \\"cheap\\" if you don't consider all the \\"externalities,\\" as economists call them, such as implicit and explicit government subsidies, pollution, minimal enforcement of health and safety laws, etc. which makes fast food &quot;cheap.&quot; And it only \\"tastes good\\" because of the addition of dozens, even hundreds of chemicals you probably don't want to know about, made by factories concentrated in industrial New Jersey. Lovely...<br />All I can say is, if you finish reading \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and ever enter a fast food restaurant again, you're either a) extremely brave; b) not particularly smart, to put it mildly; c) hopelessly addicted to fast food; or d) totally uncaring about - pick one -- your health, the environment, worker safety, America's culture and communities, the corrupting influence of money on our politics, and/or cruelty to animals.<br />Besides never eating fast food again, which is a total \\"no-brainer\\" after reading Eric Schlosser's brilliant, even courageous book, the question is, what MORE can you do? Well, how about telling your representatives in Washington that you don't want your tax money subsidizing the fast food industry? How about demanding that your school board not allow fast food in your kids' schools? How about being willing (if you can afford it) to pay a little more money up front for organic food? How about telling all your friends to read \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" and to spread the word? How about starting by reading \\"Fast Food Nation\\" yourself, today? If we do all this, maybe we can start to take back our country and our values, and to make them better than Eric Schlosser so accurately, powerfully, and disturbingly depicts in \\"Fast Food Nation.\\"	2001-09-17

It's an engrossing book for the most part, well written, angry, and &quot;in your face.&quot; It's also largely anecdotal, which limits its value to an extent, and not totally authentic, as the author doesn't &quot;really&quot; become part of the working class, but just gets a glimpse of it for a few months. Still, even knowing that Barbara Ehrenreich &quot;cheated&quot; a bit (by providing herself with a car and start-up money, for instance), and also knowing that she could have said &quot;game over&quot; whenever she wanted to, it still took some guts, or at least good, old-fashioned, investigative journalism, to do what she did. And she should be commended for her efforts. <br />Basically, Nickle and Dimed gives us a small, but valuable, glimpse into the dark side of America, at least from a non-rightwing viewpoint (maybe the America described by Barbara Ehrenreich is what the Tom DeLays, Dick Armeys, and Dick Cheneys of the world want?). A side of America where people making MORE than the minimum wage, and even working more than one job, cant make ends meet. A side of America where health care is a luxury, not a basic human right. Where getting off your feet for a minute, or talking with a co-worker, is looked at as something called time theft, a phrase that sounds like it came straight out of Orwells 1984. A side of America where one forfeits most of ones rights (to free speech, free assembly, freedom from unwarranted search and seizure, and more) when one becomes an employee, of WalMart or whomever. Where workers cant afford to live near their places of employment, and public transportation is utterly inadequate. Where millions of people are one injury, illness, or mishap from disaster. And, possibly worst of all, where the vast majority of Americans dont seem to CARE, as long as they get their houses cleaned, their fast food served, and their clothes and toys produced and sold to them at low prices, with a minimum of hassle and government regulation, and by people whose true condition is kept out of sight and out of mind. Barbara Ehrenreich does us all a service by shining a spotlight, and focusing are minds, on the dark side of the American dream. Hopefully, as we all pull together as a nation after the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we wont forget the millions of Americans who struggle every day just to keep their heads above water.	2001-09-16
US	49404909	R3DXEJM3JN0QUW	0738204609	903304880	The Childless Revolution	Books	3	141	157	N	N	Interesting topic, but major factual errors hurt credibility	This is not a bad book overall, but it could have been a far better one. The main problem is that the author, Madelyn Cain, described on the book jacket as an English teacher, doesn't seem to have much ability in statistics, or quantitative skills in general. The reason I say this is that Cain makes numerous large, and important, factual errors (see examples below). While this does not totally destroy the book, it seriously undermines the author's credibility. It's too bad, because Cain is onto an interesting, important topic here, and I find many of the stories of the people she interviews to be very interesting.<BR>Let me just list a few of the most egregious errors. For one, Cain claims at separate points in the book that 42.2% of all women are childless, and that 41% of women over 40 \\"never have a child.\\" The problem here, besides the confusing English (\\"never have a child\\" - huh?), is not so much that the NUMBERS are wrong (and they are, at least the way Cain explains them), but that the interpretation is all messed up. What Cain is TRYING to say, I think, is that the proportion of childless women has increased over the past few decades. And that IS true, according to the US Census Bureau. The problem is that the 42.2% figure refers to a huge age range (15-44), and that the vast majority of what Cain calls \\"childless\\" women are actually under age 25. Census Bureau statistics from 1998 show that the incidence of childlessness declines as women age, from 90.1% of 15-19 year olds, to 64% of 20-24 year olds, to 19.8% of 35-39 year olds, to 19.0% of 40-44 year olds. So, the relevant number here is more like 19.0% (not 42.2%), which is the percent of women moving out of childbearing years who have not had a child. And this number is indeed up since over the past couple of decades, from 10% in 1980. A big increase, but it still represents only a relative minority of women.<br />Another series of important mistakes, which Cain makes repeatedly, relates to world fertility rates/ birthrates. Here, Cain seems to get TOTALLY confused, apparently mixing up \\"rates\\" with \\"births\\" or something, and also just getting the numbers wildly wrong. So, what we have is Cain in one sentence claiming that the world's total fertility rate is 1.3 (the real figure is 2.8, more than twice as high, and well above the \\"replacement level\\" of 2.1), in another that \\"fertility rates are increasing\\" (they're actually declining worldwide), and in another that \\"birthrates are accelerating\\" (also not true; birthrates are falling worldwide, and population growth is slowing rapidly). Cain's problems with numbers continue throughout the book, strongly indicating that it's not just an editorial slipup, but that Cain has her population/fertility statistics all messed up, confused, and just plain WRONG. This is not good, especially when it is the subject of the book!! To put it mildly, this calls into question the author's credibility.<br />On the positive side, Cain is much better in presenting the interesting voices of many women who decided not to, or could not, have children. Cain makes the important point that, despite the increasing number of women choosing not to have kids - for whatever reasons - we still live in a strongly \\"pronatalist\\" society, and also one that is biased AGAINST those without children (by the way, on several occasions Cain defines \\"pronatalist\\" as \\"profamily\\", which is not correct - \\"pronatalist\\" means bias in favor of childbearing/children, a significant difference, unless you believe that it's only a \\"family\\" when there are children). Bias against women who choose not to (or are unable to) have children includes the beliefs that, among other things, those without children are (take your choice): selfish, neurotic, immature, abnormal, not complete women, etc. Yikes!<br />Just a couple other comments/questions about this book: why are there no MEN'S voices here; why doesn't the author dig deeper at the socio-economic, political, health, welfare, psychological, and other factors influencing reproductive decisionmaking, as opposed to just taking women's' statements at face value? For instance, several women claim they don't want kids because overpopulation is a bad thing for the environment (no argument here!), but Cain could have dug a little deeper and tried to get at whether or not this was the REAL emotional reason, or just an intellectualization, however important.<br />In sum, while many of the women's voices we are introduced to in \\"The Childless Revolution\\" are interesting ones, the book overall is marred by major (and frequent) factual errors and a lack of serious analysis. Very unfortunate.	2001-09-08

A House for Mr. Biswas is all of the following -- complex, psychologically perceptive, emotionally difficult, rewarding, moving, depressing, tragi-comic, deeply ironic, metaphoric, nightmarishly surreal, utterly believable, honest, exasperating, claustrophobic, prudish in some ways (no sex, for instance), deeply human, liberating, brilliant, frustrating, beautifully written  and much more. It is a book which very well may tempt you, as it tempted me, to just say the hell with it about halfway through, as Mr. Biswas struggles, but never seems able to achieve, autonomy, self respect, happiness, freedom (especially from the suffocating, sprawling Tulsi family  the ultimate in-laws from hell!!), let alone the house referred to in the title. But dont give in to temptation! A House for Mr. Biswas is a book that richly rewards those who stick with it, who persevere, just as Mr. Biswas does, although at times you may feel like you cant take it anymore (one step forwards, two steps back, argggghhh!). Perhaps a helpful attitude in reading this book, which I strongly recommend you consider, is to think of yourself as a reader and learner (to use V.S. Naipauls term for the Tulsi schoolchildren) at the feet of a superb writer with something to say and a great deal of wisdom to impart.<br />In sum, A House for Mr. Biswas is a deeply satisfying (as opposed to entertaining or superficially enjoyable) book, NOT easy summer beach reading, but a book which confirms the psychological cliché that its the HARD STUFF which is potentially the most rewarding emotionally. So, dont let the fact A House for Mr. Biswas is not easy scare you off, because this is truly a brilliant book, and one which richly deserves its ranking as one of the best books of the century (#72 on the Modern Librarys best fiction list, for instance). Oh, and by the way, why hasnt V.S. Naipaul won the Nobel prize for literature yet?  (Earth to Nobel Prize committee, come in please!)  Anyway, for what its worth, I hereby nominate him, and hope that many of you will second my nomination!	2001-09-02
US	49404909	R2ZK9D5VYBS74H	0375702431	619985996	The Nature of Economies	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Kind of a letdown, but still worth reading	Although I have the deepest admiration for Jane Jacobs, a national treasure (of two countries!) and the author of an all-time classic book -- \\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\\" -- I have to say that I found \\"The Nature of Economies\\" to be a real mixed bag...actually kind of a letdown.<br />First, I have to agree with other reviewers who found the \\"dialogue\\" in this book to be almost laughably bad.  I mean, obviously no human being would possibly speak this way (\\"in sum,\\" \\"to repeat,\\" \\"to be sure\\") with friends -- or anyone else, I would hope!  Second, the whole Socratic dialogue, pedantic monologue format here can get very tiresome at times.  In fact, it's so bad that even its own characters keep nodding off!  Third, most of these ideas, although interesting, are nothing original (as Jacobs' extensive endnotes prove), although obviously Jacobs has done a great deal of reading, and has synthesized or at least summarized other peoples' ideas fairly well, and that is nothing to sneeze at.  Fourth, and more problematic in my opinion, is the high degree of abstraction, and apparent lack of practical utility, with much of Jacobs' ideas.  I mean, it's fascinating and all that human economies are part of nature, but what are the real-life policy implications here?  OK, so central planning is bad, but does that mean that Jacobs is in favor of an extreme laissez-faire capitalist approach by government?  (I doubt it)  Is Jacobs so optimistic to believe that if we just let things run their natural course, that everything will just all work out for the best?  If she does believe this, is it naiveté or brilliance?  Or is this just a bunch of Panglossian nonsense? After reading this book, I have to say that in many ways I have no idea exactly WHAT Jacobs is getting at here.  Worst of all, \\"The Nature of Economies\\" begs the most important question, namely, WHAT ARE ECONOMIES FOR (Jacobs' unsatisfying answer - economies are for everything and everybody...huh?!?)?<br />Having said all of this, I still think the book is worth reading, mainly because it is filled with interesting, thought-provoking ideas - whoever came up with them - two of the biggest ones being that humans (and their economies) are part of nature, and that the more they \\"biomimic\\" (imitate nature) the better off we will all be.  Of course, the counterargument to mimicking nature is that nature isn't just a bed of roses, so to speak!  As the curmudgeon character Armbruster puts it, all this happy talk of \\"cooperation, symbiosis, interdependence\\" seems to ignore the fact that nature is very much \\"red in tooth and claw.\\"  Instead, it ends up sounding \\"like a barn raising,\\" not the nasty survival of the fittest (\\"and the devil take the hindmost\\" in Armbrusters' words) that is part and parcel of nature, as much as we try to romanticize or ignore it.  I DO very much like Jacob's emphasis on the benefits of a complex web of interrelationships, and also on the importance of working ALONG with natural principles, not against them.  In general, Jacobs' view that life at its best is a hustling beehive (or tropical rainforest) of activity and diversity, as in the crooked streets and serendipitous mixings of a thriving city, is strong and positive.  I also agree with her that non-serendipitous, sterile suburbia, with  its de facto separation of different kinds of people - rich/ poor, white/black/hispanic, gay/straight, etc. (see the 2000 US Census for proof of this), its often de jure separation of commercial (and cultural) activities from residential areas, and its monocultures of identical houses in subdivisions surround by wide, fast, straight roads (which serve to reduce pedestrian traffic, force utter dependence on automobiles, and prevent healthy development of community), is not good at all, and simply maintained by massive government subsidies (of roads, gasoline, utilities, etc.).<br />So, the bottom line is that - even in her 80s -- Jane Jacobs still has a lot to say and contribute, even though she said it far better 40 years ago.  So, sure, read \\"The Nature of Economies,\\" but even better, go back and read (or reread) the Jacobs' classic work - \\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities!\\"	2001-09-01

If you like books (which I presume you do if you're hanging out on the Amazon.com website :)), and especially if you like book reviews (ditto!), you're going to LOVE this book.  Gleaned from a century of New York Times book reviews (plus interviews and letters to the editor), &quot;Books of the Century&quot; gives us the some of the best in 20th century literature, as seen through the eyes of some great reviewers (e.g., WH Auden on Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;).  I can't decide which is more entertaining and edifying -- reading a well-written review which really &quot;nails&quot; a book, or laughing over a ridiculous &quot;panning&quot; of what would turn out to be a great classic.<br />My only MAJOR criticism of this book is that it includes almost NO science fiction whatsoever.  Besides being one of my personal favorite genres of literature, there are just some great all-around WRITERS missing here:  Philip K. Dick, Olaf Stapledon, Alfred Bester, HG Wells, and many more.  I mean, I can understand that &quot;Books of the Century&quot; wasn't thousands of pages long, and obviously couldn't include EVERYTHING, but leaving out an entire GENRE of literature?  I seriously question the editors' judgment on this omission (and that's why I give &quot;Books of the Century&quot; four stars instead of five)!<br />Besides that problem, which can be solved by checking out David Pringle's &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction,&quot; I strongly recommend &quot;Books of the Century.&quot;  The New York Times Book Review section is a national treasure, and this is a select sampling of that treasure.  An excellent book for a lazy summer afternoon...enjoy!	2001-08-20
US	49404909	R36RIENG0ELUEL	0380002930	498635851	Watership Down	Books	5	12	12	N	N	An all-time classic...hop right out and get it!!!	Richard Adams' \\"Watership Down\\" is an amazing book that richly deserves all the kudos it has received.  This great novel should be considered an all-time classic work of fiction -- of any genre (i.e., fantasy, allegory, science fiction, political), and for any age.  As with almost any great novel, \\"Watership Down\\" can be read on many different levels, and at many different points in one's life.  And, contrary to what a few VERY misguided reviewers have claimed, this book is \\"just a bunch of words about rabbits\\" only if you think that George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" is a lighthearted tale of pigs and cows, or JRR Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is just some stupid adventure story involving weird creatures like elves and hobbits.  Uh... I don't think so!   <br />At its most basic level, \\"Watership Down\\" is, as described on the book's jacket, \\"a stirring tale of adventure\\" by a group of rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by humans, then running into many more \\"hare-raising\\" adventures as the book proceeds.  If you read the book only on this level, what you have is an exciting book which you won't want to put down until you have finished it...which isn't bad!  But if you never looked beyond this level, you'd be missing a lot.<br />For instance, you'd be ignoring (to quote the book's jacket again),  \\"a timeless and powerful parable about society and its relation to the natural world,\\" plus (this is NOT a complete list by any means): 1) an anthropomorphic, highly believable battle between Nazi/Stalinist totalitarianism (the Efrafa warren of General Woundwort) and a Western, liberal Democracy (Hazel-rah's Watership Down society), with a detour to Cowslip's decadent, cynical, soft, and deceptively dangerous warren (Weimar Germany of the 1920s? The United States today?); 2) a generally (but not totally) unflattering look - as seen through the eyes of Nature -- at humans and human civilization (senseless cruelty and destruction, stupidity, suburban sprawl, but...the potential for redemption through significant acts of kindness, at least by a child); 3) an illustration and examination of various leadership types, and specifically, what makes a leader? (size and strength? cunning? vision? ruthlessness? caution? organizational skills? ability to provide economic/material benefits to the masses?); 4) a look at the place and importance of mythology and religion in society; 5) an inquiry into the meaning of friendship, fear, courage, etc.; and 6) the creation of a unique culture and language (\\"Lapine\\"), a la Tolkien, which is highly effective (although not nearly as extensive as Tolkien's languages).<br />In sum, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read (and I've read \\"hrair\\").   Fascinating, complex, moving, beautiful, unique.  Hop right out and get this book!!!	2001-07-29
US	49404909	RYXF36P1L10DX	0295979658	219847117	Over the Line: The Art and Life of Jacob Lawrence	Books	5	18	18	N	N	What a great book; what a great artist!!!	Jacob Lawrence, who died a year ago at age 82, was one of the great American artists of the 20th century -- or any century for that matter.  I had the privilege recently of viewing &quot;The Art and Life of Jacob Lawrence&quot; at the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, and was extremely impressed.  If you can't make it to the Phillips Collection, this book is the next best thing, with more than 200 full color reproductions of Lawrence's work.<br />And what a powerful body of work it is, mainly -- but not only -- on the African-American experience.  Themes include: slavery; escape via the Underground Railroad; heros and heroines like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman (plus Haitian revolutionary Toussaint L'Ouverture); black migration to the North; continued persecution (lynchings, Jim Crow) well into the 20th century; the Harlem Renaissance; and more.  Lawrence's style is simple (but NOT simplistic!), urgent, and direct, using inexpensive materials (cheap store-bought poster paints on hardboard -- whatever Lawrence could afford), which give new meaning to the expression, &quot;less is more!&quot;  You get the feeling in looking at these paintings that Lawrence HAD to paint, to bear witness, and to let the world know the situation of his people.<br />&quot;Over the Line&quot; is a valuable book for many reasons.  For one thing, my understanding is that these paintings, sketches, etc. have never before been published in color, or at all, in any other books on Lawrence.  &quot;Over the Line&quot; also give you information on Lawrence's life, which was very interesting in its own right.  Finally, these painting are simply a joy to look at, over and over, which this book will allow you to do.  I strongly recommend that you get a hold of it!	2001-07-20
US	49404909	RDSPPDH9P9TT8	0449911659	437546793	Rabbit, Run	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Rabbit Angstrom :  Born to Run?	I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that, prior to checking out \\"Rabbit, Run\\" from the library a few days ago, I had never read ANYTHING in my 38 years by John Updike.  What a mistake!  First, as many other reviewers (here and elsewhere) have pointed out, Updike is an amazing, powerful, beautiful prose stylist.  In my opinion, and admittedly having only read one Updike book (\\"Rabbit, Run\\") now, I would say that he ranks up there as one of the greatest American fiction writers of the 20th century.  In some ways (stylistically and thematically), Updike reminds me of another great (albeit problematic) American 20th century writer, Norman Mailer (his masterpiece, \\"The Naked and the Dead,\\" specifically comes to mind).  Second, I'm just in awe of how clearly, accurately, and powerfully Updike - at only 28 years of age (!) - was able to say so much in \\"Rabbit, Run,\\" capturing the zeitgeist of a time and place (drab, grey, conformist, late 1950s suburban American hell, as epitomized by Brewer, Pennsylvania), and presenting his characters with such nuance, balance, wisdom, honesty, and - most importantly - truth.  Incredible.  Finally, I don't feel that it's an exaggeration to say that \\"Rabbit, Run\\" (and its sequels, which I haven't read, but have read about) is one of the most important achievements in American literature EVER.<br />So, what is \\"Rabbit, Run\\" about?  In terms of themes, we've got a huge amount of material here (this is one big, meaty \\"rabbit\\" of a book!).  Life, death and sex -- in fact, lots of sex (\\"Rabbit\\" is  certainly an appropriate nickname in this context!!).  Courage to face life (and marriage, children) vs. giving in to \\"rabbit-like\\" fear.  Commitment/responsibility vs. freedom/running away.  Religion vs. true faith (and what, if anything, such true faith might consist of).  Sin vs. redemption.  The fate of an individual attempting to find meaning and identity while fitting in (or not) to a stultifying, stifling, conformistic society (and ones' particular place/role in it).  The romantic fantasy of busting loose, hitting the road, and finding a better place. (Personal note: as a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, I was strongly reminded in \\"Rabbit, Run\\" of \\"Born to Run,\\" \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" etc. with their many similar themes). Physical perfection/athletic achievement as potential sources of meaning, especially when you're past your \\"prime\\" (\\"Rabbit\\" was a high school basketball star, but now mainly relives his fading \\"glory days,\\" as Springsteen would say).  Growing up vs. remaining an eternal youth.  Order vs. chaos.  And, ultimately, the difficult balancing act between ones' quest for PERSONAL happiness and fulfillment vs. the needs of family, friends, employers, society.  And much more.<br />Is this book, as some reviewers here have stated, \\"depressing?\\"  Well, actually, I'd have to say yes.  For one thing, Updike presents no definitive answers to all the important, dark, disturbing questions he raises here (nor could he, nor, as an artist, SHOULD he, in my opinion!).  Meanwhile, almost everything his main character (Rabbit) touches somehow turns out wrongly, or tragically (the misery and alcoholism of his wife, leading to the book's climactic tragedy, being the greatest example).  Plus, the setting of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" is inherently gloomy (dreary, \\"dung\\" colored apartment buildings which smell of \\"cabbage cooking\\" or \\"something soft decaying,\\" a deserted ice plant with \\"rotting wooden skids on the fallen loading porch,\\" etc.).  People are mainly unhappy, or trapped, or scared, or confused, or looking for a little excitement to brighten up their dreary existences, or all of the above.  So why read such a depressing book?  Here are just a few reasons: to learn, to experience the world through the eyes of a great artist (Updike), to challenge yourself, to enjoy the sheer beauty of top-notch writing.  Finally, a philosophical question:  is the point of reading (or any other activity) simply &quot;pleasure?\\"Should we run, like a rabbit perhaps, from anything that might scare us, or threaten us, or even depress us?  Or should we stand our ground, look those things straight in the eye, and - unlike Rabbit Angstrom - NOT run.  Personally, I vote for the latter option!	2001-07-14

At the wedding (held - appropriately - in northern Virginia, not far from the Bull Run/Manassas battlefields) of the son of my boss (a native South Carolinian), I was confronted with the starkly differing, and emotionally charged, Northern and Southern views of the Civil War (as well as the often awkward attempts at reconciliation), which persist to this day.  While talking with one of my boss's aunts (a native of Charleston, and seemingly a nice old lady), I mentioned, in an attempt at polite conversation, that my wife and I had found Charleston's pre-Civil War mansions to be beautiful.  The response, which startled me, was a sharp, \\"there was nothing CIVIL about it...it was the War of Northern Aggression!!!\\"  An hour or so later, as everyone prepared to leave, I once again ran into my boss's aunt, who this time apologized to me for her previous comment, stating that \\"the war was a long time ago...we're all one country now.\\"<br />As I read Horwitz's book, with its highly appropriate subtitle referring to \\"the Unfinished Civil War,\\" I kept hearing echoes of this schizophrenic wedding conversation, with its conflicting themes -- of anger and reconciliation, past and future, remembering and letting go, mythology and \\"fact\\" -- in the author's encounters and conversations.  What was the Civil War exactly, and why do so many people continue to care so much about it nearly 140 years after it ended?  In \\"Confederates in the Attic,\\" Tony Horwitz - a Pulitzer Prize winner for his writings on other war zones -- hits the road (and the library) in an attempt to find out.   In my opinion, he does a great job in helping us to think through these questions. <br />Two more points on &quot;Confederates in the Attic.&quot;  First, if you think that Tony Horwitz overdoes things in his portrayal of stark differences between Northernersand Southerners, Whites and Blacks, urban and rural dwellers, then I suggest you look at a color-coded, county-by-county map of the last Presidential election.  If you do, you will see that vast swaths of this country (the rural South, the sparsely settled Rocky Mountain West, the agricultural Plains states, the white, evangelical \\"Bible Belt\\") are largely in one color (Republican), while much smaller (but far more densely populated) areas of the country (the diverse big cities, the Northeast, the Pacific coast, and the industrial Midwest) are largely in another color (Democrat).  This electoral map reflects some real - and deep - divides in America today, on issues like \\"big government\\" vs. \\"states rights,\\" guns, race, property rights, regional differences, etc.  In other words, many of the same nasty, complex issues which ultimately sparked the Civil War.  Notice also that the electoral map divides fairly neatly along Union/Confederacy lines.  So, how much has changed in America over the past 135 years?  Well, depending upon who you talk to (and Tony Horwitz talks to everyone!), you'll get diametrically different answers.  <br />Second, these differences are directly mirrored in Americans' differing views of the Civil War - even when they know little (or nothing) about that war (and Horwitz finds that ignorance is rampant).  I found Horwitz's recounting of the story of Michael Westerman particularly revealing in this regard.  Here we have a seemingly clearcut case of a young white man flying the rebel flag from his truck being shot to death by a young black man, apparently enraged by this (and supposedly by someone in Westerman's truck yelling \\"Niggers\\" and shaking the flag with his hand).  Dig a little deeper, however (as Horwitz does), and you find that the black man (Freddie Morrow) apparently had no idea what the flag stood for (he thought it was ''just the 'Dukes of Hazzard' sign\\"), while the white man (Westerman), apparently just thought the flag looked \\"sharp' and matched his red truck.  Of course, many people - white and black - chose NOT to dig deeper, but instead to immediately line up on one side or the other based on their preconceived belief systems.  Thus, the Sons of Confederate Veterans hailed Westerman as a \\"Confederate Martyr\\" and hero, while Freddie's mother blamed \\"the flag and the `...'-calling,\\" which in her view, is bound to \\"blow up\\" if \\"you keep putting it on people.\\"<br />Here we have a classic example of WHAT the Civil War was about, and WHY people still care.  For a thoughtful examination of, among other things, whether or not - to quote my boss's aunt - we truly are \\"all one country now,\\"  I strongly recommend Tony Horwitz's book, \\"Confederates in the Attic.\\"	2001-07-04

As someone who made the transition from meat-eater to 99% vegetarian over the past 10 years, I appreciate Diana Shaw's non-dogmatic approach and welcoming attitude, as well as all the information on foods (&quot;what to eat, where to get it, how to prepare it&quot;) and nutrition that she provides.  Overall, I think she has done an excellent job in these areas, and has provided a useful, well-written book with plenty of excellent recipes.  <br />So...why am I only giving this book 3 stars?  Well, because this is supposed to be the &quot;essential&quot; VEGETARIAN cookbook, and what do many vegetarians eat?  Well, at least in the case of this vegetarian, lots of tempeh, tofu, and seitan, all of which my wife and I LOVE (in stir fries, particularly), and which I presume are pretty popular, since they (certainly tempeh and tofu) are sold in almost all the supermarkets I've been to around here.  So what does the author have to say about these nutritious, delicious foods?  Tempeh:  &quot;looks like an allergic reaction,&quot; and &quot;fermented soybeans aren't the most mouth-watering concept.&quot;  Tofu: &quot;unwilling to embrace it&quot; or &quot;to dismiss it altogether.&quot;  And Seitan?  Well, I guess the author must REALLY hate this vegetarian staple/meat substitute (it really does taste a lot like chicken -- I love it!) because, as far as I can tell, she never mentions it ONCE in her whole book!!  <br />Now, obviously, the author has the right to her opinions -- it is HER book, after all -- but unfortunately, because of her personal dislike of these three foods, she has ignored them almost completely in what she touts as the &quot;essential&quot; cookbook for vegetarians.  Number of recipes for seitan Shaw provides? Zero.  For tempeh? One.  For tofu? Six.  That's it -- seven total recipes for three of the main staples of many vegetarians' diets!  To me, this is a major flaw and seriously diminishes the usefulness of the book.  Also, I'm really surprised, almost shocked, since these are great foods which are easy to cook in all kind of delectable ways.  Very strange...<br />In sum, this book has many good things going for it, but also some MAJOR omissions for something that claims to be the &quot;essential vegetarian cookbook.&quot;  As a result, I find it a helpful, but ultimately limited, reference.	2001-06-27

Also, this is great for those who are moving -- slowly or more rapidly -- in the direction of either total vegetarianism, or perhaps &quot;pesco-vegetarian&quot; (veggie except for some fish).  Personally, I made my transition to 99% vegetarian (occasionally I will eat salmon) over a period of several years, first cutting out red meat about 12 years ago, then reducing poultry consumption until totally eliminating it from my diet about 4 or 5 years ago, and now am almost completely vegetarian.  If you are strictly &quot;vegan,&quot; you might not like this book, and the meat recipes could also be annoying to strict vegetarians, but overall, I think this book is a very useful and practical guide for those moving -- for health, environmental, or ethical reasons -- towards a more plant-based diet.  And in my opinion, there's nothing &quot;fishy&quot; about that!!	2001-06-26
US	49404909	RINNXYM1QPTWB	0060187239	630454514	April 1865: The Month That Saved America	Books	2	7	23	N	N	An amazing month, but did it really  &quot;save America?&quot;	Fascinating idea, well written for the most part, but with one major caveat: it's wrong.   Or, to put it more precisely, the author, Jay Winik, sets out a bold, even audacious thesis -- that April 1865 was \\"the month that saved America\\" - but then fails to prove it.  What evidence does Winik present to support his belief that April 1865 was THE turning point in American history?  Unfortunately, not much.  Basically, Winik argues that: 1) the assassination of President Lincoln, and the close calls for Secretary of State Seward and Vice President Johnson COULD have led - but did not -- both the North and the South into utter chaos, \\"an orgy of retribution,\\" a bloodbath, or even a resurgence of Confederate resistance; and 2) the South COULD have turned (but, once again, DID NOT) towards endless guerilla warfare (Winik cites such disparate examples as the Afghan mujahedeen vs. the Soviets, the Maccabees vs. the Romans, the Scythians vs. the Persians, and the Spanish vs. Napoleon).<br />OK, so let's start with argument #1, that Lincoln's assassination could have led to everything unraveling.  Sure, theoretically that's POSSIBLE, but what EVIDENCE does Winik provide that it was even somewhat likely?  Well, unfortunately, not much.  Essentially, Winik argues that the procedures for executive succession upon Presidential death were not very clear-cut, even though over the past century there had been two such occasions (John Tyler on the death of President Harrison in April 1841, and Millard Fillmore on the death of President Taylor in July 1850).  However, there is no question that had John Wilkes Booth's conspiracy been fully carried out, with the Vice President (and Secretary of State) assassinated as well, this would have been an EXTREMELY difficult time for the country - as it would be today or any other time.  But, as interesting as it might be to think about the \\"alternative history\\" possibilities, as a matter of historical FACT Johnson and Seward were NOT assassinated.  So, while Winik does have a point that this was a dangerous moment at a delicate time (the winding down of the Civil War), he offers NO evidence of any plots, coup attempts, Southern attempts to take advantage of the turmoil in the North, or really any serious question regarding Vice President Johnson's right to be President (the fact that many influential people didn't like him doesn't prove anything).   Bottom line:  in my opinion, Winik does not even come close to proving argument #1.<br />So, how about argument #2, that the South very well could have chosen the path of guerilla warfare?  Here, I would say that Winik has an interesting point, and I don't deny that the guerilla warfare option was there, but how PLAUSIBLE was it?  Winik seems to belong to the \\"great man\\" school of history, arguing that if it weren't for a few people - Lee, Johnston, Grant, Sherman - making key choices at critical junctures - Southern soldiers very well could have taken to the hills.  But, besides giving us some interesting information about the potentially enormous damage and chaos that guerilla warfare can inflict, plus a list of \\"top candidates\\" to lead such a campaign, Winik never proves that this option was a serious one for the South in April 1865.  Sure, there were people in both the North and South who would have preferred the course of more blood and more vengeance over peaceful reunification, but Winik undermines his own argument with his description of the horrific, desperate conditions (both physical and psychological) to which the South had fallen.  In my opinion, it would be a lot more accurate to say that by April 1865, the South was utterly shattered, requiring a miraculous, incredible sequence of events for it to continue its fight in any serious way - and then WHAT?!?  Also, in my humble opinion, Winik overestimates Lee's ability to singlehandedly rally the South given the horrible devastation it had suffered.<br />Besides these problems, and they are undoubtedly BIG ones, \\"April 1865: The Month That Saved America\\" has a few things going for it.  First, Winik has the ability to make you feel like you are \\"right there\\" in the shoes of REAL flesh-and-blood people (as opposed to historical icons) as they struggle with things in their control, and also with the many more things over which they have NO (or very little) control.  His sketches of key players like William Sherman, U.S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Joe Johnston, Jefferson Davis, Nathan Bedford Forrest, John Wilkes Booth, etc. are generally excellent, although not necessarily related to his main thesis.  The same can be said regarding Winik's descriptions of historical events like Lee's surrender, Lincoln's assassination, the destruction of Richmond, and many more.  And Winik DOES offer an interestingly fresh, broad-view approach to his subject, possibly informed by his experience on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Finally, Winik is an engaging enough writer, with the major caveat that he tends, for some strange reason (insecurity in his material?), to lapse into exaggeration, clichés, and embarrassing, overly dramatic, potboiler prose - `Then he waited,\\" \\"A cold hard rain began to fall,\\" ''Back in Washington, all hell was about to break loose.'').  Finally, Winik's main thesis, that April 1865 was a crucial month, IS an interesting one - I just wish that he could have stuck with it, PROVED it, and not rambled away from it at every chance (and there are MANY such chances). <br />In sum, I believe that the flaws of Jay Winik's book outweigh the positives.  It's too bad, because there's no doubt that April 1865 was an extremely eventful, important month in American history, and that Winik is onto something here.  But, given all of its flaws, I reluctantly conclude that I cannot enthusiastically recommend this book.	2001-06-23
US	49404909	R1KE2L6QEUEE6I	0743204123	833686522	Maestro: Greenspan's Fed And The American Boom	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Bob Woodward: the ultimate fly on Alan Greenspan's wall	I must admit that, when I began reading Bob Woodward's Maestro: Greenspan's Fed and the American Boom, I was skeptical.  First of all, the title seemed overblown, implying that Alan Greenspan was THE ONE and possibly ONLY ONE who had orchestrated the fantastic U.S. economy of the past 10 years or so.  Given the vast size and complexity of the U.S., let alone the WORLD economy, that just didn't seem plausible to me.  Second, I wondered how much of this book would reflect the \\"good\\" Bob Woodward (smart, even-handed, easy to understand, great access to sources) and how much the \\"bad\\" Bob Woodward (too much the Washington insider to be truly critical or an \\"outside the box\\" thinker; the heavy use of anonymous sources - he says he talked with hundreds of people, but doesn't say who they are; too little analysis; sometimes lazy and seemingly uninspired, \\"paint-by-numbers\\" writing; etc.).  In the end, I found both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" Woodwards here (my ultimate conclusion is that they are inseparable, \\"flip sides\\" of the same coin, if you will), but overall, I think the good outweighs the bad, making this book interesting and definitely worth reading.<br />What's cool about \\"Maestro,\\" and about Bob Woodward in general, is that his practically unlimited access to all the players makes you feel like you are right there, a fly on the wall during important top-level meetings.  And not just any fly, but a Bob Woodward special mind-reading fly!  Yeah, I kind of like that...Bob Woodward as a mind-reading fly, with the amazing, uncanny ability to recreate people's conversations, and even INNER dialogues, years after they took place, and when the fly WASN'T EVEN THERE when the dialogue took place!  So, how does this fly do this?  Well, pretty much, it talks to lots of other (anonymous) flies, especially the really big, important ones (at least in their own minds).  And, of course, EVERY other fly wants to talk to the Bob Woodward fly, because, well, `cause it's cool when your words and/or analysis gets in his book!  Plus, you certainly wouldn't want to be the only big, (self) important fly NOT to have talked with the Bob Woodward fly, the uber-fly, the LORD of the Flies (sorry, that was a bad one, I know)!<br />Are there negatives to \\"Maestro?\\"   Well, the book is certainly not perfect. Two things that particularly bothered me in \\"Maestro\\" were: 1) some stretches of the book are actually kind of dull, even boiler plate, both in terms of content AND style; and 2) Woodward the ultimate insider doesn't bring much real critical analysis to this book, and at times the tone seems almost worshipful of his sources.<br />Still, I felt like I gained a lot of insight from \\"Maestro\\" into how the Federal Reserve really operates, how decisions get made in Washington (it's not all good or all bad), and how much (or little) control top policymakers have over events (e.g., the October 1987 stock market crash, the 1994/1995 Mexican peso collapse and bailout, the Asian economic crisis of 1997, the August 1998 Russian default and near chain-reaction collapse of the entire bond market).  Also, once again we can see that, for better or for worse, the role of personalities is extremely important.  But, at least at the Alan Greenspan Fed portrayed in this book, what amazed me as an economic analyst myself was how much data, models, analysis, and intellectual debate really matter.  Also, I think that Bob Woodward does an excellent job in focusing on (and explaining) the importance of getting good, real-time information on specific sectors and sub-sectors of the vast economy.  Alan Greenspan himself understands this very well, checking the latest numbers on his computer screen almost obsessively, with just a \\"stroke of Button A\\".   At times, I can't tell whether Greenspan is more the Wizard of Oz or more the little man behind the curtain, fooling (and impressing) everyone - except, in the end, Toto the dog  -- with essentially smoke and mirrors (and incomprehensible, eye-glazing, mind-numbing statements that seemingly could mean anything)!<br />Ultimately, what you've got here is a mixed bag, but overall (in my opinion) the bag has significantly more good stuff in it than bad.  Or, to put it more formally (more Alan Greenspan-like?), I believe that the positive attributes of Bob Woodward's \\"Maestro\\" overall tend to outweigh the negatives.  Would it be better, as one reviewer states, to \\"read the alternative press\\" to get the \\"outsider\\" view of Washington (in this case, Alan Greenspan)?   Or do you think you're better off with the ultimate \\"insider\\" perspective?  My answer: YES - read both - and form your own opinions!  But don't dismiss Bob Woodward and \\"Maestro\\" just because they ARE \\"inside the Beltway.\\"  That's just silly, since the people Woodward writes about are powerful players whose actions can (and do) significantly influence our lives.  Given that, it's a good idea to try and understand them, and \\"Maestro\\" is not a bad place to start!	2001-06-10

Yet Sarah York, a Unitarian Universalist minister with a tremendous amount of experience, knowledge, and -- even more importantly -- wisdom regarding death, dying, grieving, and \\"remembering well,\\" has succeeded in writing a book that is at once practical, powerful, poignant, moving, even inspiring.  <br />At its heart, \\"Remembering Well\\" is not so much about death and dying as it is about life, living, love, and memory.  Perhaps its most important lesson is the necessity of allowing time and \\"sacred space\\" for those who have experienced a loss to be able to \\"give voice to their sorrow\\" and to \\"remember well\\" the person who has died.   In Sarah York's view, and I couldn't agree more, suppressing strong feelings, or glossing over them, is not a good idea for anyone.  In fact, it's very unhealthy and really just asking for trouble down the road.  Unfortunately, I have personally been to funerals where almost every one of Sarah York's rules has been violated, where the service was utterly impersonal, or where the religious official running the service took the opportunity to try and impose their religious perspective on the audience, leaving many people (myself included) unsatisfied and even angry.  <br />The bottom line here is that although it is not a simple matter to \\"remember well,\\" it certainly can be done.  If you want to find out how, Sarah York's book is a great place to start.  I strongly recommend it to everyone!	2001-05-29

All in all, \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is well written, interesting, hard to put down, even a \\"page-turner\\" at times.  Problems?  Just a few.  First is the sheer sprawling scope of the undertaking - ONE book on THREE Roosevelts, when there have been volumes written on EACH Roosevelt?  But, overall this works pretty well here, and like the Roosevelts themselves, it's hard to fault the authors for trying to cover too much ground.  A more fundamental problem with the book is that although the three Roosevelts' lives overlapped to an extent, their political careers and activities were more or less separate, sometimes giving this book the feel of really being three books sort of stuck together.  First, we have a relatively short book on Teddy Roosevelt, followed by a moderately long book on FDR, and then another relatively short book on Eleanor.  Are there common themes here tying it all together?  Absolutely.  But are there also three separate individuals here, each with his/her own story?  Absolutely.   The last fault of \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is perhaps the most problematic; namely, the authors obviously LOVE their subjects, and the overwhelming positive slant on all three Roosevelts (the authors occasionally cite a fault, but usually just to show how the particular Roosevelt in question overcame it and became a better person) can become a little annoying at times, and even hurt the authors' credibility somewhat.  Personally, I agree that these three people were amazing, fascinating, important, even heroic figures, but they were certainly not perfect.  The internment of Japanese-Americans under FDR, to cite just one example, is an absolute disgrace, a moral outrage, and a HUGE blot on FDR's record.   Teddy Roosevelt's nationalistic/imperialistic jingoism, cruel streak, and even bloodthirstiness are certainly not endearing or admirable qualities either! <br />Having said all that, I still really liked this book, and definitely recommend it.  Basically, the authors do an excellent job with the fascinating story of how three pampered, upper-class snobs became courageous activists, leaders, and champions of the common man.   The authors give us a good feel for how Eleanor Roosevelt grew to eventually leave \\"the insular world of the patrician elite far behind.\\"  Also, how FDR and TR came to despise the idle rich, and how they both came to see inherited wealth as immoral and un-American (FDR: \\"the transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes...is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people\\").  What would FDR and TR have made of the current Republican Party's zeal to repeal the \\"Death Tax,\\" as they call it?\\"  Mincemeat, for one thing!  But, sadly, the Franklin and Teddy Roosevelts of the world seem to be in short supply these days - in either political party.<br />A constant theme throughout \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is that of the WASP establishment vs. the \\"class traitors\\" (the Roosevelts), and how each side came to hate each other.  The authors have some interesting things to say about this issue.  For instance, that hatred of FDR signified not just rational opposition to his economic policies, but seemed to stem even more from the WASP establishment's \\"horror of equality, from their fear of losing  their privileges and, even worse, their sense of privilege.\\"  J.P. Morgan had even warned that \\"if you destroy the leisure class, you destroy civilization.\\"  Thus, the authors point out that, even as conditions for the wealthiest 2% improved, their \\"extravagant, hysterical attacks\\" on FDR actually increased.  And FDR responded in kind, reveling in the hatred of business leaders/plutocrats who wanted only, in his words, \\"power for themselves, enslavement for the public,\\" and comparing them to the fascist menace abroad.  On the contrary, FDR had been educated - by Cousin Ted and others - to believe that the \\"noble, virtuous life\\" consisted not of profit maximization, but of public service.   In Teddy Roosevelt's memorable words, the rich were \\"malefactors of great wealth.\\"  And Eleanor grew to see her class as seriously limited, narrow-minded, smug, reactionary, anti-Semitic, and racist.   <br />Ultimately, the authors portray all three Roosevelts as people of courage, vigorous people of ACTION above all, people who disdained the trivial, non-productive life they had left behind, people who were willing to descend \\"into the vulgar world of office-seeking\\" (in other words, real life) to interact with different classes, ethnicities, religions, and even races.   In other words, the Roosevelts did what most members of their class shunned.   Although the Roosevelts certainly were not intellectuals or \\"geniuses\\" in the usual sense, all three are portrayed as brilliant in their ability to \\"[recognize] the needs of...people early on,\\" to \\"[sense] their political mood,\\" and to \\"[mobilize] their support.\\"  In sum, the authors conclude that the three Roosevelts represented transformational leaders for America in the 20th century, changing the course of events dramatically from what they were, and what they might have been.  As the authors conclude, \\"from 1881, when TR first ran for the New York State Assembly\\" until the rise of Reagan conservatism a century later, \\"the three Roosevelts charted the course of progressive reform in America.\\"   A fascinating story, well told.	2001-05-25
US	49404909	R1RXJ3K2G0IFO6	0393048101	36899158	America's Musical Life: A History	Books	5	24	24	N	N	America as music and music as America	In the late 1980s, having passed the US Foreign Service written test, I took the Oral Exam, one part of which was basically aimed at probing - in front of a panel of 3 Foreign Service officers - one's general knowledge of American history, culture, and world affairs, plus ability to think on one's feet.  Among other questions, I was presented with the following (without any advance warning): `pretend you are a high school teacher giving a lecture on the history of American music; you have 3 minutes - GO!'   Well, all I can say is, I wish that Richard Crawford's \\"America's Musical Life: A History\\" had been available back then, and that I had read it, because, let's just put it this way, there's a good reason why I didn't pass the Oral Exam!!  Having now read Crawford's book, I feel like asking for a second shot at the question...<br />Basically, what this extremely learned, intelligent, well-organized, readable (and mercifully free of musicologist jargon) book does is to help us understand America from the perspective of music (i.e., what music meant to America), and also to understand American music from the perspective of its social, cultural, economic, political, racial, geographic, and technological history (i.e., what America meant to music).  As Crawford states in his introduction, his goal is to undertake a study from a \\"broader scope [which] might illuminate parallels and intertwinings that give the country's music...its distinctive identity.\\" Crawford accomplishes this, and more, starting from American music's early origins (Native American, Early Christian, \\"Old, Simple Ditties,\\" and New England Psalmody), moving on to 19th century music (devotional music, minstrels, parlor songs, patriotic and war songs, classical music, etc.) to the folk, jazz, blues, pop, theatrical, and rock music of the 20th century.  Throughout, Crawford makes it clear: 1) that there IS such a thing as \\"American\\" music; 2) that this music is extremely diverse, both in its expression and its origins; and 3) that to fully understand America, one needs to understand its music, and vice versa.  <br />In sum, this book represents an obvious labor of love by an extremely well qualified author.  I highly recommend it, whether or not you are a Foreign Service candidate!	2001-05-11
US	49404909	R1MGFIU6OZHK4V	0684834804	742968691	Robert Kennedy : His Life	Books	4	8	8	N	N	RFK:  the eternal &quot;stranger&quot;	Evan Thomas has written an excellent, fair-minded, admirably even-handed biography of Robert Kennedy, and, given the mythos that surrounds the Kennedys, that alone is a significant accomplishment.  Thomas also happens to be a fine writer, and this book is a pleasure to read (with the exception that at times I found it very hard to tell which \\"Kennedy\\" Thomas was talking about).   However -- and I'm not saying that this is Thomas' fault - after nearly 400 pages, I still can't say I understand the \\"younger brother full of pain.\\"  For instance, I still have essentially no clue - assuming that RFK had not been assassinated, had won the Democratic nomination for President in 1968 (unlikely), and defeated Richard Nixon in the general election (also unlikely) - what kind of President he would have made.  And, probably wisely, Thomas takes the safe, responsible road and does not speculate on this but simply ends the book with RFK's assassination.  Too bad.  I would have enjoyed Thomas' speculations very much, and this is an unfortunate flaw in an otherwise first-rate book.<br />As portrayed by Thomas, RFK is, to paraphrase Churchill, a mystery, an enigma, and a riddle.  What made this guy tick?  Thomas speculates, which is about all he can do given the subject and the availability of solid information, but really, who knows?  Was RFK a liberal, moderate, conservative, all of the above, or something else altogether?  Again, after reading Thomas' book, I still can't say.  Which was the \\"real RFK\\" - the young assistant to Senator Joseph McCarthy's communist witchhunts or the older man who came to admire Che Guevara and Cesar Chavez?  The young man who -- as Attorney General -- went along with J. Edgar Hoover's wiretaps of Martin Luther King and had little interest in the civil rights struggle, or the older man who made a triumphant, inspirational tour of black South Africa (and the inner cities of the USA)?  A realpolitik, ruthless, back-channel conniver?  Or an idealistic, insecure, brave, inspirational leader?  And on and on the contradictions, complexities, and confusions go, as Thomas tries valiantly to make sense of it all.<br />In sum, this is an excellent book that I highly recommend, about a fascinating, important person who, ultimately, may simply be unknowable.  So, I find it highly appropriate that one of RFK's favorite books was Camus' \\"The Stranger,\\" because that is what RFK was, and possibly always will be.	2001-05-06

Like countless other people before him, Bruce Feiler has taken a tour of the Middle East.  OK, maybe more extensive than most people, and with excellent guides, but...what's the big deal here?   Does Feiler have anything original or interesting to say?  After forcing myself to slog through 428 pages of often painful, pretentious, forced, overwrought, self-indulgent, mystifying (as opposed to mystical), uninspiring, boring \\"prose,\\" I honestly cannot answer in the affirmative to either question.  The only thing I can figure is that this book project gave the author a great excuse to take a cool trip, meet lots of interesting people, and to write something on a high-profile topic (the Bible), which could (potentially) sell a lot of copies, and possibly even push Feiler from a relatively obscure author to a relatively well-known one.  Based on the early results (number of high-profile book reviews, interviews, etc.), congratulations may be in order to Feiler, but what's in it for the rest of us?  Got me!<br />The main problem with this book is not really the subject material per se or even the concept, unoriginal as it is (touring the Middle East with Bible in hand - what a brilliant idea!), but more the author's heavy-handed, obvious, forced, cliché-ridden, self-important, numbingly earnest, and sometimes just ridiculous over-the-top style, combined with screamingly obvious \\"insights\\" and brilliant revelations (NOT!) behind every rock and donkey (described in typical Feilerese as \\"Abraham's transportation!\\").  All I can say to this is: Oh my God!!  Where does this all end?  I mean, Feiler breathes the air, and it could be the same air Moses breathed!  Feiler walks on the ground - the same ground (perhaps) that some other Biblical figure walked on thousands of years ago!  Geez, with all this living history all around them, how does anyone living in the Middle East get through their day (I can just hear it now - `Oh, honey, I'm heading out to the store down the street which a Biblical patriarch might have walked on to get some proverbial milk and honey!  Do we need anything else?').<br />Meanwhile, on sort of a parallel track to Feiler's tedious, seemingly endless (you may feel like YOU have been lost in the desert for 40 years after reading this book!) wanderings through the Middle East is his incredibly annoying journey of \\"self-discovery.\\"  Apparently, for instance, the fact that Feiler was born and raised in the a \\"flat, sandy place, with pine trees...temperate winters...swampy summers\\" (he's talking about the American South, by the way), is critical in some mysterious way (never explained) to his powers of observation and psychological \\"transformation\\" he claims to experience in the \\"exaggerated geography\\" of the Middle East.  Also, apparently, there is some cosmic importance (never explained) to the fact that Feiler has always been a \\"rigid, controlled person,\\" reliant on such horrible things as \\"reason, skepticism, logic, learning\\" (a few weeks in the desert, though, and Feiler apparently has switched over to right-brain thinking - \\"emotion, intution, trust\\" -- yeah, whatever!!).  Phrases (all left unexplained) like \\"it's as if the act of mapping the land was forcing me to remap my own internal geography\\" or \\"suddenly all the ideas I had been contemplating...came together in a flash\\" or \\"without verbalizing it, without even understanding it, I knew that this moment...would always be an anchor for me\\" or - my personal (least) favorite, repeated several times in slight variations throughout the book --  \\"I felt a quiet snap of release, like a door clicking open in the middle of the night, beckoning me to a place I'd always been afraid to go.\\"  Ee gads, Bruce, what the heck are you talking about?!? <br />So, are there any redeeming qualities to \\"Walking the Bible?\\"  Well, um, hmmmm...sort of, maybe.  The author HAS done a lot of research, and you CAN learn something here.   Another definite redeeming quality is Feiler's main companion/guide on this trip: Avner Goren, Israel's chief archaeologist in the Sinai from 1967 to 1982.  Goren is a highly likeable character: unforced, warm, natural, boyish, comfortable in his skin, tremendously knowledgeable, wise, and a true native to the desert and the region.  Basically, what I wonder is this: why, oh why, couldn't Goren - not Feiler -- have written this book?  And also, as Feiler himself asks Goren, \\"so why did you come on this trip with me?\\"  Good question, and one you may ask yourself if you read this book.  Better idea:  DON'T read \\"Walking the Bible.\\"  Given the fact that there are many fine books on the Bible, the Middle East, the desert, and journeys of personal discovery (Jim Crace's \\"Quarantine,\\" for instance) out there, I strongly recommend that you read them instead.  As Moses himself might say: \\"Let Feiler's book go!\\"	2001-04-21
US	49404909	R3DEN3TBBKYIC6	0684859440	204140347	Jew Vs Jew: The Struggle For The Soul Of American Jewry	Books	2	37	42	N	N	Largely anecdotal, highly selective, lacking in rigor	In \\"Jew vs, Jew,\\" Samuel Freedman has something to say, and overall says it well, but still I recommend that you take this book with a large grain (maybe even a pillar!) of salt.  For instance, Freedman argues that the \\"Orthodox model\\" has \\"triumphed,\\" but at the same time there is evidence (which he doesn't cite) that enrollment of non-orthodox Jewish children at Jewish Day Schools is booming.  Also, as Freedman himself acknowledges (in the last line of the book -- \\"the only ones fighting are the only ones left who care\\"), the vast majority of Jewish-Americans (especially the \\"just Jews\\" group, as Freedman calls them) are NOT involved in this \\"struggle for the soul of American Jewry.\\"  What about all those people?  And what are the implications of the fact that most of these people are proceeding with their lives regardless of what the Orthodox \\"establishment\\" thinks about them?  Is Freedman writing off half (or more) of the American Jewish population, or is he just not interested?  Examples like this make me feel that although \\"Jew vs. Jew\\" is well-written (in a journalistic style), it somehow is missing the forest for the trees, and also that it lacks rigor - i.e., hard evidence and an analytical framework to put all the anecdotes (interesting though they may be) in some sort of intellectual context.  <br />Three other criticisms of \\"Jew vs. Jew.\\"  First, Freedman claims (ambitiously) to be painting a picture of \\"the soul of American Jewry\\" today.  But does Freedman really believe that there IS one \\"soul\\" and one \\"American Jewry\\" - or should be -- in such a large, diverse population?  Second, Freedman argues that, in America, Jews are being \\"loved to death,\\" and that this is a bad thing.  But wait a second...isn't it GOOD that anti-Semitism has declined to the lunatic fringe?  And, is it really soooo bad that, given the freedom to do so, different Jews will chart their own course towards God and religious expression?  What's wrong with having a whole range of Jews - from politically and socially liberal, secular humanists to politically and socially conservative, ultra-Orthodox - out there, anyway?  Christianity has that, and it seems to be doing just fine!  And Freedman never explains why, just because Jews are a minority in America, they are doomed to fail.  What about the explosive growth of other religious minorities in America (Mormons, Muslims, etc.)?   Finally, Freedman seems to ignore the fact that much of the conflict he cites regarding Jews in America is really about power and money.  How about some honest discussion about fears and prejudices among non-Orthodox, suburban Jews, who fear that an influx of Orthodox Jews will overwhelm their town, hurt their schools, and perhaps drive down their property values?<br />It's not that I think Freedman is totally off base in what he has to say - indeed, the liberal, secular, Zionist Camp Kinderwelt IS dead, and the ultra-Orthodox Kiryas Joel IS thriving.  Also, there's no doubt that intermarriage rates are very high, probably over 50%, and that many (most?) of the offspring from these marriages are not being raised Jewish in any meaningful sense.  It's also definitely true that there ARE passionate disagreements between Jews - just as with all other groups of people (Christians, for instance).  But Freedman never really explains how arguments within the Jewish community are NECESSARILY a bad thing.  Would Freedman really prefer a monolithic community or one in which arguments are suppressed?  <br />Anyway, in my opinion Freedman's book really should be subtitled:  \\"These are the kind of problems you WANT to have!\\"  For one of the first times in history, Jews have nearly complete freedom, and lack of anti-Semitic persecution, in a majority non-Jewish country, and to all that I say: mazel tov!  The question now is whether Judaism - in all its manifestations - can adapt and compete in the free marketplace of ideas that is America.   True, Camp Kinderwelt itself may be dead,and its liberal, Zionist, secular orientation on the wane at the moment, but something tells me that it's not the end of the story quite yet.  The Jews - however they are defined -- have been written off many times, but somehow are still around.  Camp Kinderwelt is dead...long live Camp Kinderwelt!	2001-04-17
US	49404909	R112I27VWZEVA	0679767800	339858237	The Stars My Destination	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Jaunt out and get this book!	As with other top-notch works of science fiction, \\"The Stars My Destination\\" is filled with insightful social commentary and psychological insight, is powerfully written, tremendously imaginative, audacious, exciting (I couldn't put it down and finished it in 3 hours), even very funny at times (i.e., the parody of scientific notation - \\"quant suff\\" for \\"sufficient quantity,\\" the round-the-clock New Years' Eve parties and the amusing/pathetic spectacle of rich people desperately seeking a thrill!).  All in all, an amazing feat by Alfred Bester, who wrote this book in the 1950s, wrote relatively little else, and died in 1987 a relative unknown outside sci-fi circles.<br />In some ways, \\"The Stars My Destination\\" is a visionary work, including numerous science fiction elements that have become standard nowadays (in fact almost clichés) but weren't necessarily in the 1950s when this book was written.  In fact, I would say that Bester was far ahead of his time in his views on the colonization of the solar system, conflict between Earth and her satellites, the rise in power of massive corporate conglomerates (and the relative shrinking power of the government and national sovereignty), the disruption of an entire economic/political system by a mutant with unusual powers/characteristics (Gulliver Foyle) and/or a rare yet absolutely critical physical substance (PyrE), androids and intelligent robots, issues of mind control, identity, and memory (echoed in works like \\"Total Recall\\" and \\"Blade Runner,\\" among other sci-fi works).  Despite the fact that it was written almost 50 years ago, \\"The Stars My Destination\\" remains relevant, original, and fresh today - quite and accomplishment for any author!<br />Major themes of \\"The Stars My Destination\\" include: 1) the great power  -- both potential and actual -- of our minds, and how in most people this power is sorely underutilized or misused; 2) the different ways of perceiving \\"reality,\\" and the lengths that some - the  very disturbing Skoptsky sect, for instance, which believes in living without any sensation whatsoever, and so has its members submit to an operation which severs their sensory nervous systems - will go to block it out; 3) the concept of \\"jaunting\\" - transporting ourselves over great distances (and even through space and time) by harnessing the power of our minds; 4) obsession/monomania; 5) various forms of repression (economic, psychological, social); 6) the \\"common\\" man vs. the \\"aristocracy,\\" 7) issues of privacy, individuality, and freedom; and much more.... The bottom line is that there's a lot of \\"meat\\" -- satirical and otherwise -- here to sink your teeth into, besides the intrigue, mystery, and rip-roaring action!<br />And what a great character Bester has created in Gulliver \\"Gully\\" Foyle ...definitely one of the most memorable in science fiction.   In less than 200 pages, Gulliver (appropriate name, by the way, reminiscent of Swift's character who, among other things, travels to all kinds of strange destinations and sometimes seems to be a giant next those around him) evolves from a pathetically limited, passive, dull, miserable, wretched, almost sub-human lump of flesh at the beginning of the book to a smart, clever, complex, quasi-godlike creature by the end; from a psychologically \\"disconnected,\\" violent sociopath consumed by anger and the desire for revenge (a theme borrowed from \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" and possibly \\"Moby Dick') into a psychologically complex, mature, resourceful human being with a conscience and evolved sense of ethics; from a nobody to (possibly) mankind's greatest hope for salvation.   And, ultimately, Foyle is transformed from someone we look at with scorn and disgust to a heroic figure we admire and even find inspirational!<br />The bottom line: this is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read, and I am just amazed how little known it (and its author) are, especially compared to far lesser works like \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" for instance (once again proving that life's not fair!).  I'm also amazed that this book hasn't been made into a movie, although given how Hollywood usually screws things up, maybe we should all be grateful for that! :)  Anyway, I'm glad that someone (a fellow Amazon.com'er -thanks) recommended this book to me, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to you!	2001-03-25
US	49404909	R2S1U5OXO5R31	0684869101	898878692	The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession	Books	4	17	21	N	N	Obsession with body image: it's not just for women anymore!	\\"The Adonis Complex\\" is an interesting book about an important, but often ignored (and rarely spoken of - hence the subtitle \\"The SECRET Crisis of Male Body Obsession\\") problem affecting a lot of men -- obsession with their body image.  It seems that only a few years ago, this was a problem that only affected women, but not anymore.  Pick up a newspaper or magazine, or turn on the TV these days, and it is hard to avoid images of half-naked guys with washboard abs, bulging muscles, a full head of hair, and a generally youthful appearance selling products ranging from underwear to cars, suntan lotion to soft drinks.  In the view of the authors of \\"The Adonis Complex,\\" this constant bombardment via media images of \\"buff\\"men is an important factor pushing many men to spend hours of their lives (and large quantities of their money) obsessing over (and attempting to enhance) their looks.<br />Interestingly, the authors of \\"The Adonis Complex\\" point out, male concern over body image has increased as women have made substantial gains in many traditional male arenas - work, the military, sports, etc.  The authors hypothesize - plausibly, in my opinion - that men's desire to look more \\"masculine\\" has increased in response to these gains, as they ask themselves \\"what is there left...to distinguish myself as a man.\\"  Thus, the one area where men can still distinguish themselves vis-à-vis women is physical strength/muscles.  As the authors put it, \\"no matter what...achievements women accomplish, they will never, ever be able to bench-press 350 pounds.\\"   Sadly, though, this is not much of a basis for a well-balanced, happy life.  And, ironically, many men cited in \\"The Adonis Complex\\" lose the very things they want most - jobs, relationships - through their obsessive/compulsive behavior in attempting to make themselves more attractive.  (Also ironically, most women actually seem to prefer far LESS muscular men - Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance - than the hyper-masculine ideal pursued by many.  In fact, according to \\"The Adonis Complex,\\" most women seem to find super-muscular men to be unattractive, even disgusting!)<br />The bottom line here is that working out or spending time working on one's appearance is fine if you are doing it to be healthy, stay fit, and even to look good, as long as it is done within moderations and doesn't get taken to extremes.  Personally, I try to get to the gym 4-5 times a week and to eat a healthy diet, and it makes me feel good to do so.

As far back as medieval times, we learn from Rosen, authorities routinely ruled that potential injury to a neighbor's privacy meant that a window looking out onto a common courtyard \\"had to be removed even if the individuals whose privacy was violated failed to protest.\\"  Rosen also introduces us to the fascinating Talmudic concept of \\"Hezzek Re'iyyah\\" (the \\"injury caused by seeing\\"), which basically says that even a small invasion of privacy causes damage.   <br />Rosen's discussion of privacy in cyberspace is very interesting and timely.  Rosen points out how, every time you use the internet, you are leaving a trail (an \\"electronic footprint\\" of \\"cookies\\") which is recorded - whether by a private company or the government -- and which makes it possible for someone to (as Rosen puts it) \\"trace nearly everything we read, write, browse, and buy.\\" <br />A big part of the problem facing privacy in America today, as Rosen points out, is that technology keeps racing ahead, allowing for greater and greater monitoring of our every move.  Given this, Rosen frames the question as following: \\"will we be passive in the face of technological determinism\\" or not?  Today it is possible for your employer to monitor literally every keystroke you hit on your computer keyboard, to read all your e-mails, to monitor your phone conversations, etc.  Just thinking about this makes me somewhat tense, and, indeed, according to Rosen, studies show that workers who are being monitored electronically have \\"higher levels of depression, tension, and anxiety\\" than unmonitored employees.  Interestingly, Rosen points out, the monitored employees also appear to be less productive than the unmonitored ones as well, so all this monitoring apparently doesn't even help - and may even hurt - the company's bottom line!<br />In sum, Rosen's book lays out the case that privacy - so important for the many reasons which Rosen explains -- is today under siege.  Where are the \\"backstage\\" areas to let our hair down, remove our `masks\\" and be ourselves, Rosen asks?  Are we all just characters on \\"The Truman Show\\" (or \\"Survivor\\" or \\"The Real World\\")?  How can we optimally pursue, as Rosen puts it, \\"the capacity for creativity...the development of self and soul, understanding, friendship, and even love\\" in a world where we can never be sure of privacy?  Where is there a place for human eccentricity, individuality, and ultimately, freedom, in a world where everyone is subject to constant surveillance (like Jeremy Bentham's \\"Panopticon\\")?  And, Rosen asks, who would want to live in such a world?  If you find any of this interesting, I recommend that you read \\"The Unwanted Gaze.\\"	2001-03-14

Normally I write fairly long reviews, but for this book it's pretty simple, so I'll keep it short.  David Sedaris is at times very funny (the scene where he and his classmates attempt to explain Easter in French to a Muslim from Morocco is absolutely hilarious), but at other times it's like he's straining too hard, or maybe he just ran out of good material.  In one case he LITERALLY resorts to toilet humor (his desperate efforts to flush someone else's giant turd down the drain) for a cheap laugh. Overall, if you want some really funny moments, interspersed by long stretches of -- at best -- mild amusement, then buy this book.  If not, don't, and instead wait until David Sedaris &quot;write better book one day!&quot;	2001-03-09
US	49404909	R1IX8B8IABRA2	0375708278	27895627	Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A fascinating story, well told by Erik Larson	\\"Isaac's Storm\\" is an informative, well-written, well-researched, often gripping book,  and is well worth reading on several levels.  First and foremost, although this book describes a disaster - and the chain of events leading to it -- which took place over 100 years ago, it still has many themes which ring true today.  Among these are: 1) hubris and its tragic repercussions, a theme going back at least to Ancient Greece; 2) man's faith in the ability of science and technology to overcome/control nature; 3) excessive belief that the world is a rational place, and a consistent underestimation of the irrational forces - jealousy, greed, pride, insecurity, racism, obstinacy, etc. and 4) man's almost unlimited ability to resolve \\"cognitive dissonance\\" (i.e., changing one's behavior, beliefs, or perceptions in order to reduce or avoid psychological discomfort), often with disastrous results.<br />Second, \\"Isaac's Storm\\" is fascinating from a scientific point of view.  Erik Larson is excellent at describing the genesis, development, and impact of hurricanes, and also the particular challenges in forecasting them.  \\"Chaos theory\\" comes into play here, and Larson convincingly shows how a small perturbation in a complex system (the proverbial \\"butterfly flapping its wings\\") can lead to \\"an outcome no rational person would ever have expected.\\"  Specifically, although many  tropical \\"waves\\" move off the coast of  West Africa each summer, the vast majority do not develop into hurricanes.  But, for some reason, every so often one will grow into a monster storm which, a week or so later, can wreak incredible devastation thousands of miles away - in south Texas, south Florida, or South Carolina!<br />Third, Larson's book is engaging from a historic perspective, giving us a glimpse of life at the beginning of the 20th century in Galveston, Texas and elsewhere in the energetic, dynamic, rapidly growing young nation - the United States.  Larson has definitely done a tremendous amount of research for this book, and it shows, in telling the story - and telling it well -- of one of the greatest natural disasters in US history (but one which is largely forgotten today).<br />Finally, \\"Isaac's Storm\\" is illuminating from a human perspective.  Here we have a diverse and interesting cast of characters (first and foremost, of course, being the &quot;Isaac&quot; of the title) who, in their beliefs, actions, and interactions with each other, create their own \\"butterfly effect\\" of a sort.  So we observe how politics, economic competitiveness (Galveston vs. Houston), sibling rivalry, cultural misunderstandings and even racism, and the overconfidence/hubris of several key weather officials (i.e, that hurricanes ALWAYS curved out to the Atlantic, and COULD NOT hit Galveston) and others turn what would certainly have been a terrible loss of property into a total disaster, with a horrendous death toll.  There are lots of \\"if only\\" scenarios here, but ultimately, it comes down to the following:  \\"if only\\" the residents of Galveston had been ordered to evacuate, or at least told that an incredibly powerful storm threatened them, then thousands of people's lives could have been saved.  Fascinating stuff...I wholeheartedly recommend this book! (P.S. This is much better than the wildly overrated &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot;)	2001-02-25

Holy Bourbon Street, Batman, we're not in Gotham City (or Kansas, for that matter) anymore!  Nope, \\"A Density of Souls\\" is DEFINITELY set in lush, class-conscious, decadent, rat-infested, decaying, water-logged, tragic, unnatural, thin-veneer-of-civilization New Orleans, and its author is definitely a son of Anne Rice!  Murder (!), suicide (!), incest (!), great-looking people (!) (mainly boys!), repressed desires (!), deep dark secrets (!), sex (usually violent, usually forbidden!), alcoholism (!), horrible deaths (!), horrible lives (!), stereotyped characters (!), gothic (even ludicrous) plot twists (!), religious (Roman Catholic, of course) imagery galore (!), a trip to Europe (!), art (!), madness (!), and all topped off by a massive hurricane with the bodies of dead people and rats floating through the streets (!).  My god, did Anne Rice dictate this novel to her son, or does this stuff just run genetically in the Rice family?  (Maybe now that scientists have begun to unravel the human genome, they can take some blood samples or something and actually find out!).<br />Anyway...despite my previous paragraph, this novel actually is not ALL bad.  If nothing else, it takes on some serious, important, even ambitious themes.  Most important, I would say, is the whole issue of male sexuality and identity, and specifically homosexuality/homophobia, which in our ever-tolerant, easy-going society (NOT!) must be repressed at all costs...  And also how (as research has shown) the most homophobic people are usually the ones most obsessed with their own \\"issues\\" of repressed homosexuality.  Besides that, I would also add that Christopher Rice is not just trading on his mother's name or his looks, but definitely has a good deal of his own talent.  Some of his descriptions and psychological insights are very well done, and he certainly has a lot of energy!  \\"A Density of Souls,\\" despite its many flaws, is still a fairly promising first novel.  One can only hope that Christopher Rice's writing will become less frenzied, less heavy-handed, less soap opera-ish, and - basically -- less like his MOTHER'S as his career progresses (alternatively, he could just continue the family tradition and start cranking out vampire, witch, and mummy books!).	2001-02-18

What the heck is a \\"Bobo,\\" you ask?  And why should you care?  Well, no need to look any further; because David Brooks has all the answers for you right here in his book, \\"Bobos in Paradise,\\" each chapter packed with a seemingly unending stream of witty (and mostly funny, some hilarious) one-liners from a leading Compassionate Conservative Comic Commentator.  And certainly there's enough material here to keep several stand-up comedians in business for years.  For instance, Brooks' description of the contortions which Bobos put themselves through in an attempt to show that they don't really MEAN to make gobs of money, they're just \\"creators\\" who just so \\"happen\\" to be insanely successful.  Or, his hilarious lessons on \\"how to be an intellectual giant\\" (and, ultimately, get on TV, because \\"those who are not on television find their lives are without meaning\\").  And much more.... <br />In sum, \\"Bobos\\" are the synthesis, in the quasi-Hegelian sense, of the bourgeoisie (the \\"thesis\\") and the bohemians (the \\"antithesis\\").  So, according to Brooks, we appear to have reached what Frances Fukayama might call \\"The End of History,\\" the ultimate synthesis and triumph of liberal democracy (highlights include moderation, civility, material success, and peaceful coexistence).  And Brooks gives us a fascinating historical synopsis as to how this came to pass.  Very interesting stuff, no doubt, but all this leaves ME a little nostalgiac for the day when at least SOME people actually cared PASSIONIATELY about things - art, ideas, culture, politics, the environment, whatever!   Now, it's all about muddling differences, Clinton's \\"triangulating,\\" reconciling seeming oxymorons (i.e, Dubyah's \\"compassionate conservativism\\"), and taking care at all times to be PC and not offend anyone.  And heaven forbid that anyone be a true PARTISAN (i.e., someone who actually BELIEVES in something and is even willing to fight for it!).  <br />A side point: I find it interesting that Brooks - the uberBobo - admires Jane Jacobs (\\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\\") so much, since Jacobs celebrated a thriving URBAN ecosystem as the ideal habitat for humans, while the natural habitat of the Bobos is undoubtedly suburbia, with its soulless subdivisions, \\"bowling alone\\" social breakdown and alienation, ugly \\"big-box\\" stores, shopping malls, soccer moms, SUVs and minivans.  According to David Brooks, THIS (yay, sprawl!) is (apparently) Paradise, although it's not clear how he reconciles this with his admiration for Jacobs. (But Bobos are, if nothing else, good at reconciling things!)<br />In fact, it's not clear how Brooks - or any Bobo, for that matter - can reconcile many of the things discussed in this book.  How about the seemingly irreconcilable values of social justice on the one hand, and laissez faire capitalism on the other?  Or the values of rootedness/community/faith vs. mobility/personal autonomy/free choice?   Or how about being \\"green\\" while also owning an energy-inefficient, resource-gobbling \\"McMansion,\\" a sub-zero refrigerator, an oven that could roast an ox in 10 seconds flat, and a pollution-spewing SUV?  Or spending your days working to make money, while not losing your artistic, bohemian soul?  Or having fun \\"responsibly.\\"  Or enjoying your demanding, enriching, fulfilling, painful vacation (without, of course, being a \\"travel snob\\")?   Or dozens of other seemingly irreconcilable values?   Good luck!<br />Let me just mention a few other criticisms of this book.  First, although David Brooks deluges us with anecdotal evidence, fascinating and entertaining though it is, I don't see any hard facts and statistics (or even interviews) that provide EVIDENCE to back up his arguments.  I'm not saying that Brooks is wrong in his observations or conclusions, but as an economist (and scientist at heart), I would have liked to have seen some serious sociological statistics here.  Second, although there's little doubt that David Brooks has got the habits of his friends, and friends' friends, down cold, what about the rest of the world?  Are the masses of \\"middle America\\" (not to speak of the Third World!) really Bobos in any significant numbers?  And isn't there a backlash to all this (i.e., the WTO protests in Seattle)?  Third, the tone of this book is somewhat confusing.  Is this all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, or is it supposed to be serious sociology?  Does David Brooks really think Bobos are more subjects of mockery and comic one-liners, or are they the great hope of mankind?  Or both at the same time?   It would be nice to know what Brooks REALLY thinks about Bobos.  <br />But maybe that's the whole point here; namely, in Bobo-land, noone ever really thinks ANYTHING definitively (so someone can actually claim to be a \\"Methodist Taoist Native American Quaker Russian Orthodox Buddhist Jew\\" - ohhhhh).  In the world of the Bobos, it seems that everything is dumbed/watered/blanded down, made as unthreatening as possible (\\"have a nice day, come again!\\"), compromised, \\"go along get along.\\"  As Brooks himself admits, this is NOT exactly exciting or romantic stuff we're talking about here.  So, after finishing this book, I couldn't quite decide whether I agreed more with Stendhal (commenting on the bourgeoisie), that Bobos make me want to \\"weep and vomit at the same time,\\" or with David Brooks, who believes that \\"it's good to live in a Bobo world,\\" and also that Bobos have the potential to lead us \\"into another golden age.\\"  Anyway, since Bobos are powerful and apparently may be here to stay for a while, I recommend that you read this generally well-written, witty, engaging book, and decide for yourself!	2001-02-17
US	49404909	R3RG17YVV1IO73	0375403817	465478936	A Little Too Close to God: The Thrills and Panic of a Life in Israel	Books	3	34	37	N	N	Worth reading, but proceed with extreme caution!	This book has some very strong points AND some very weak ones too, and on balance I think it is worth reading, but I definitely recommend that you proceed with caution!!  Let's start with the strong points.  For one, I found Horovitz's dialogues with his religious, West Bank-settlement-dwelling brother-in-law Natan to be totally fascinating.  Horovitz does the reader a great service by allowing Natan's words and arguments to be presented so respectfully, and forcefully.   By the end of their discussion (Chapter Seven - \\"On the Other Hand\\"), my head was spinning and I (a liberal, secular person through and through) actually felt torn between their two worldviews.  I also couldn't help but like Natan, which really surprised me, especially since I honestly expected him to be a raving right-wing nutcase or something.  But it's just not that simple!  Similarly, I found Horovitz's conversation with his first cousin (Chapter Nine - \\"What Kind of Jewish State?\\"), the ultra-Orthodox (&quot;with a less than Orthodox past&quot;) Shai, to be similarly fascinating.  I guess my prejudices, and also conversations I have had with secular Israelis (when I studied in Israel back in the mid-80s), who seemed to hate the ultra-Orthodox as much or more than they hate the Arabs, had me prepared for Shai to be an intolerant religious zealot/drone with a simple, easy answer for everything, and a total rejection of secularism, democracy, and modernity.  But nooooo, once again my preconceived notions were shattered, and Shai turned out to be a smart, worldly, highly educated, sophisticated, interesting guy.  Very interesting, and once again, not that simple!  Finally, I admired Horovitz's honesty throughout the book in discussing his feelings regarding living and raising a family in Israel, relations within his politically and religiously diverse extended family (almost a microcosm of Ashkenazi, Jewish Israel), and the pros and cons (from his perspective) of living in Israel vs. living in England or Dallas or something (in a humorous discussion with a recent Russian immigrant, it's the WEATHER, of all things, which turns out to be the most persuasive argument!).<br />OK, so what did I NOT like about this book?  Unfortunately, a fair amount.  For starters, even though Horovitz admits right off that he doesn't really discuss the Israeli Arabs or the Sephardic Jews (not to mention the huge community of recent Russian immigrants), I still found it limiting and frustrating, especially since these three groups (Sephardim, Israeli Arabs, and Russian immigrants) account for a large majority of the Israeli population.   A much worse flaw in the book is Horovitz's near-hysterical obsession with Benjamin Netanyahu.  OK, I don't like Netanyahu either, but he WAS elected Prime Minister of Israel by hundreds of thousands of people, and I just don't see the need for page after page of Horovitz's rantings and ravings (sample: \\"Hate. Hate. Hate. That was Netanyahu...\\") about one individual.  Then, there's the flip side, which is his POSITIVE obsession with Yitzhak Rabin and - to a far lesser extent - Ehud Barak.  OK, I liked Rabin a lot too, and thought that he was leading Israel in the right direction, but c'mon, do we really believe that even Rabin could have solved ALL the problems which Horovitz points out (the religious-secular split, for instance?)  Good luck!!  At one  point, Horovitz even admits bluntly that he had  come to idolize and mythologize Rabin - but only since he was assassinated - and to view him as a symbol for the Israel he dreamed of.  Does Horovitz have a right to do this?  Sure!  But does making Netanyahu and his supporters into \\"freaks,\\" and Rabin and his supporters into martyrs and angels, accomplish anything?  I don't see how; in fact, if David Horovitz is typical of the Israeli left, that country is in BIG trouble!  What's scary is that if even an intelligent, worldly, political reporter like David Horovitz can become so hysterical, then whatabout the rest of Israel?  <br />Another problem with this book is Horovitz's apparent naivete (arrogance?) regarding the Arabs.  OK, sure, I think that Israel somehow needs to make peace with its neighbors, but how on Earth does Horovitz know so much about the hearts and minds of Arab leaders he happens to have met or interviewed?  For instance, based on having interviewed Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini &quot;half a dozen&quot; times, Horovitz comes to the conclusion that Husseini can't possibly desire secretly to destroy the state of Israel.  Well, of course that MAY be the case, but how does Horovitz KNOW that for sure?  And how can he be so \\"certain\\" that Bassam Abu Sharif, mastermind of several airline hijackings, is \\"genuinely committed\\" to a permanent peace with Israel?   Who knows, Horovitz may be right, but as my Jewish grandmother might say: so, he's a mind reader no less?<br />Finally, and I guess I shouldn't really criticize Horovitz for this, since I live in relative safety here in America (except for the violent crime, road rage, and even domestic terrorism here!), but the bottom line is that Horovitz is a privileged person, with all kinds of connections, and if the latest elections don't go his way (i.e., the latest election, in which the &quot;hawk&quot; Ariel Sharon defeated the &quot;dove&quot; Ehud Barak), he can leave Israel any time he wants.  As he himself admits, he still has his English passport, his wife her US passport, and his kids one of each.  Thus, for Horovitz, escape from Israel is just \\"a flight away.\\"  In a way, this actually makes the book MORE interesting, because knowing that he can leave at any time means that Horovitz can say things (or look at them more objectively) perhaps that those \\"stuck\\" there might have more difficulty doing.  On the other hand, it also means that Horovitz is an Israeli with one foot always out the door, never totally \\"there.\\"  This almost makes me feel like I'm reading a book by someone on a (very)extended Foreign Service rotation or something, and leaves me with the uneasy feeling that the subtitle of his book is misleading.  Horovitz may have been in Israel for 20 years, but he apparently still has never committed to a &quot;life in Israel,&quot; just the \\"thrills and panic.\\"	2001-02-16

To paraphrase Seamus Heaney's description of  Shield Sheafson to describe his version of  \\"Beowulf,\\" let's put it this way:  \\"That was one great book!\\"  Prior to my reading this version of Beowulf, I just sort of assumed that it was a \\"classic\\" that I knew about from school, appreciated for its historical significance, but basically never read with any success (or pleasure).  But, as soon as I read the first word of Heaney's translation, I was encouraged!  No \\"los\\" or \\"yeas\\" or \\"beholds,\\" just the simple, colloquial, but wonderfully effective \\"So.\\" Nice! Then, I was totally hooked at the end of paragraph two, by the simple, declarative sentence, \\"That was one good king.\\"  Wow - that's one excellent translation!<br />But, I must say, what I REALLY liked about \\"Beowulf\\" was that I am a HUGE J.R.R. Tolkien fan, and it was immensely enjoyable for me finally to read one of Tolkien's main sources for \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" etc.  As the introduction to Heaney's \\"Beowulf\\" reminds us, \\"when it comes to considering Beowulf as a work of literature...one publication stands out,\\" and that is none other than Professor J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Beowulf:  The Monsters and the Critics,\\" which \\"changed the way the poem was valued and initiated a new era...of appreciation [for Beowulf].\\"   There are so many parallels between \\"Beowulf\\" and \\"Middle Earth\\" that I could go on for pages, but here are just a few.  First: heroic battles with monsters, including one underwater battle (Beowulf vs. Grendel's mother) which reminded me of Gandalf's vs. the horrible Balrog in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  Second: names, places and things (barrows, meadhalls, mail, shields, desolate fens, Eanmund/Eomund), and animals (wolves, ravens, etc.).  Third: swords with special powers and even personalities.  Fourth: rings which signify/connote power.  Fifth, of course: DRAGONS, one of which of course plays a central role in \\"The Hobbit.\\"  Sixth: craven counselors to elderly but proud kings (Grima \\"Wormtongue\\" to Theoden, Unferth to Hrothgar).   Seventh: plot lines, such as the theft of a gem-studded cup from the dragon's stash by a \\"thief\\" (in \\"The Hobbit\\" it's Bilbo the \\"burglar\\"), or the abandonment of the hero (Beowulf, Bilbo) by his comrades in the face of the dragon, or the loyalty of one faithful servant (Wiglaf to Beowulf, Samwise to Frodo), allowing the hero to fulfill his task.  Eighth: songs.  And lots more (i.e., both authors are Christians writing about pre-Christian/pagan worlds).<br />So, in conclusion, I would say:  read Seamus Heaney's wonderful, readable, fantastic, modern translation of Beowulf, and, if you're a Tolkien fan like me, you'll enjoy the added bonus of enhancing your understanding of \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings!\\"	2001-02-07
US	49404909	R2G4L30L6ZX7VT	0156007754	787923440	Blindness (Harvest Book)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Haunting, horrifying, maybe even hopeful�.	\\"Blindness\\" is the first book I have ever read by Jose Saramago (how did I miss him? was I blind?), but I'm sure it won't be the last.  And even though by almost all accounts the English translation is top-notch, I still wish that I could read \\"Blindness\\" in the original Portugese.  For one thing, I know from reading books like Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" (\\"L'Etranger\\") and \\"The Plague\\" (\\"La Peste\\"), or Sartre's \\"No Exit\\" (\\"Huis Clos\\") - all books which \\"Blindness\\" calls to mind, by the way -- in English first, and then in the original French, that it makes a big difference whether you read the original or a translation, however well done.  And in the case of \\"Blindness,\\" I think it's particularly important because in Saramago's book, the use of language - the exact choice of words, nuanced meaning, punctuation, grammar, etc. -- is absolutely central.   But, unfortunately, I cannot read Portugese, and in a way that seems appropriate for \\"Blindness,\\" because in some sense it makes me partly \\"blind\\" and reliant on my guide (my \\"eyes\\"), the translator, who can see AND understand in both languages.  And isn't that - seeing but not understanding -- what the book is at least partly about?  To quote Saramago, \\"I don't think we did go blind, I think we are blind, Blind but seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see.\\"<br />Anyway, here are just a few thoughts, based on what I thought I was able to \\"see\\" - and hopefully understand - about this book.  First, I agree with many of the reviewers here that Saramago's language/prose style in \\"Blindness\\"  -- unquoted dialogue, unnamed characters, shifting tenses, limited punctuation, no chapter headings or numbers --at times can be confusing, even frustrating and uncomfortable.  But, unlike some of these reviewers, I think this is a very clever and deft decision by Saramago, handled very well, and a perfect example of \\"form\\" matching \\"function.\\"  What better way to convey a sense of blindness than by making things difficult so thata reader finds himself navigating a passage, stumbling a little, doubling back, getting a little lost, then proceeding forward again?  It seems to me that what is required in this situation is - just as if one were a blind person trying to find one's way down a street -- plenty of patience, and also concentration, and a belief that in the end, with luck and perserverance, the effort will be rewarded.  Like Faulkner's \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" or James Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" this is not an \\"easy\\" book in terms of language, but as in those books, it's perfectly appropriate and fitting for this Kafkaesque nightmare (i.e., \\"The Trial,\\" \\"The Metamorphosis\\"), and actually now that I've read \\"Blindness\\" I can't imagine the book working better if it were written any other way!<br />Second, I also agree with many of the reviewers here that \\"Blindness\\" is not \\"easy\\" in an emotional sense either, with page after page of excrement, various varieties of violence (including rape and murder, among other things), all sorts of human degradation, plus a general, sometimes overwhelming feeling (reminiscent of accounts from the Nazi concentration camps) of disorientation and loss of morality, compassion, or anything positive for that matter.  Thus we witness, once again in literature, the depths to which humans are capable of sinking once the \\"thin veneer of civilization\\" is stripped away.  Is this an original topic?  Not particularly.  But is it a topic that has been exhausted, especially following what was arguably the bloodiest, nastiest century in human history?  No, I don't think so!   More importantly, does Saramago do a good job with this material?  Yes, I think so!<br />Finally, it is important to emphasize that Saramago's \\"blindness\\" is not just the  \\"normal\\" physical kind of blindness, but more a strange, metaphorical, allegorical, even spiritual kind.  Statements like \\"we're blind because we're dead...we're dead because we're blind,\\" \\"God does not deserve to see,\\" \\"Only in a world of blind people would things be what they truly are,\\" etc. all point in the direction of where Saramago is going here.  Also, contrast the \\"normal\\" blind person, who becomes the thugs' bookkeeper; the ophthalmologist's wife (the book's fascinating central character), who can \\"see\\" but almost wishes she couldn't; the people who still can see but are terrified that they too will soon go blind; and the people already struck down with \\"white blindness.\\"  <br />In sum, this is very interesting, powerful material, well done by Nobel-prize winner Jose Saramago.   I strongly recommend this haunting, thought-provoking book!	2001-02-03

What it IS, is an honest (brutally so at times), courageous, intelligent, revealing, tongue-in-cheek, self-effacing, self-critical (painfully, even), and last but not least, dark yet very funny book. <br />What is this book about?  Well, that's kind of hard to explain.  Among other things, Dave Eggers explores (and has lots of interesting things to say about): celebrity, parenthood, the search for love and real human connection, the quest for meaning in life, the \\"you owe me because I'm a victim\\" culture, suburbia, social class, death, youth, and his more-often-than-not attempts at getting laid (with a \\"sexologist\\" woman, with a female colleague just after they leave a comatose friend's bedside).  Plus, lets not forget the ultimately far more important topics of optimal Frisbee techniques, ideal apartment configurations for sliding in your socks, and the potential dangers of babysitters (\\"razors, chainsaws\\") and collapsing decks!   <br />And finally, Eggers is an excellent, creative, off-beat, always-interesting writer.  I particularly liked the scene, for instance, where Dave is cutting his 11-year-old brother Toph's hair, and all of a sudden they start talking about Dave's magazine's plan to fake the death of former, now somewhat obscure, \\"Eight is Enough\\" star Adam Rich as a sendup of...well, all kinds of important things!  Eggers, without breaking the flow of the conversation, simply has himself say \\"You're breaking out of character again,\\" and then proceeds smoothly as the two of them hold a sophisticated, very adult-level debate regarding the ethics, motivations, cultural implications, etc. of such a stunt.  Of course, I realize that this device has been utilized many times before in literature, but still, Eggers employs it skillfully - and hilariously.  Other scenes, like his \\"Real World\\" interview (and encounters with &quot;Real World&quot; star &quot;Puck&quot;), or his trip back to Chicago in search of...well, something or other, are very well done as well.  Actually, almost everything in this book works for me, including the powerful scene where he is attempting to stop his cancer-ridden mother's nosebleed, his revenge fantasies on all those who have wronged him or his family, his attempts at getting a magazine (\\"Might\\") off the ground, the saga of his mother's &quot;cremains,&quot; and much more.  Whether or not you think this is a work of \\"staggering genius\\" (I think it comes close), Eggers has written an excellent, excellent book which I strongly recommend!	2001-01-21
US	49404909	R1U3V99S0FZB7M	0425176428	539869630	What If?: The World's Foremost Military Historians Imagine What Might Have Been	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Uneven, but overall excellent	For anyone who likes history, this book is an uneven, but overall excellent and very enjoyable, series of exercises in &quot;counterfactual&quot; history.  Not the silly, frivolous, or nonsensical kind, where Robert E. Lee all of a sudden is given a nuclear bomb, but instead serious, meaty (even highly PROBABLE) ones, like what would have happened if there hadn't been a mysterious plague outside the walls of Jerusalem, or if there had been a Persian victory at Salamis, or if Genghis Khan's drunken third son (Ogadai)had not died just as his hordes were poised to conquer (and probably annhilate) Europe, or if Cortes had been killed or been captured Tenochtitlan, etc.  <br />The major flaw with this book is that the essays are of somewhat uneven interest level, style, and quality.  Personally, for instance, I found the essay on the Mongols to be fascinating, sending chills down my spine!  &quot;D Day Fails&quot; by Stephen Ambrose, on the other hand, didn't do much for me at all, nor did &quot;Funeral in Berlin.&quot;  In general, I would say that the essays covering earlier periods in human history tend to be better than ones covering more recent history.  Possibly this is in part because the later periods have been covered to death.  I mean, how many &quot;counterfactuals&quot; on the US Civil War can there be before we get sick of them?  But a well-written, tightly-reasoned counterfactual which, based on events hundreds or even thousands of years ago, quite plausibly leads to a result where there is no Judaism, Christianity, or Islam, or Western culture at all, is absolutely fascinating in my opinion.  If nothing else, books like &quot;What If?&quot; show how important CHANCE is in human history, as well as the importance of the INDIVIDUAL, as opposed to some Hegelian/Marxist-Leninist historical &quot;inevitability.&quot;  The bottom line is that it is rare that anything is truly &quot;inevitable&quot;, and the aptly titled &quot;What If?&quot; gives us some excellent case studies.	2001-01-13

As I already have stated in my Amazon.com reviews of \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is a fantastic, amazing, mind-boggling, exciting, moving, heartbreaking, brilliantly written classic at the level of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (and believe me, I NEVER thought I'd be saying that!).  Also, it is important to reiterate that this is NOT a \\"children's book\\" in the sense that it is strictly for - or about - children (although certainly, it can be read by intelligent young people!), and it is absolutely not \\"fantasy\\" in the usual sense of the word (Phillip Pullman has stated that he can't read \\"fantasy\\" books, because they don't \\"tell [him] anything interesting about being a human being\\").  Instead, this trilogy is Phillip Pullman's dark take on Biblical Creation and an extended riff on many of the themes raised in John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\"   The bottom line:  if Phillip Pullman is mainly \\"fantasy\\" for children, than so are John Milton and the Bible!  I don't think so....<br />Anyway, the third book in Pullman's trilogy, \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" is the culmination of Pullman's exploration of themes like courage, love, free will, sin, God, the Church, and, of course, swirling around all of this, the ever-mysterious dark matter, or \\"dust.\\"  Most of the other characters we have become acquainted with in Books 1 and 2 are back (plus some new ones too, especially the Mulefa and the Gallivespians).  And just as the \\"The Golden Compass,\\" can be thought of as being about Lyra (and her beloved daemon, Pantalaimon), and \\"The Subtle Knife\\" mainly about Will Parry, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" brings everything (and everyone - especially Adam and Eve, er, Will and Lyra, that is!) together for a heart-stopping, gut-wrenching, tear-jerking finale.   Here, we see Will using his \\"subtle knife\\" (AKA \\"Aesahaettr\\" - the God destroyer) to cut windows through into different universes, and even to the world of the dead.  We also learn aLOT more about Dr. Mary Malone, who turns out to be a critically important character.  Finally, we discover lots more about dust, the \\"Authority,\\" angels, Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel, Iorek Byrnison, and much more.<br />This is a highly complex story, but I think that Pullman manages to hold it all together brilliantly.  His characters grow and change in fascinating ways, and undertake incredible, even heartbreaking, acts of courage and self-sacrifice.  If you are not brought to tears at various points in \\"The Amber Sypglass,\\" especially the scene where Lyra and Will board the boat to the world of the dead and leave their daemons behind, and when they realize they love each other but cannot be together, then you should sign up for membership in your local Oblation Board, because you have a heart of stone!!!  <br />To summarize three points I made in my reviews of \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife\\":  1) this is far darker and more disturbing material (especially if you have a closed mind towards explorations of God, religion, the Church and the nature of man - all the interesting and important things, in other words) than the perfectly serviceable \\"Harry Potter\\" books, to which the Pullman trilogy inevitably is going to be compared (this trilogy is far, far greater than Potter!!); 2) Pullman is a master of language, and his use of names (among other things) is fascinating..  \\"Lyra,\\" for instance, is a constellation in the NORTHERN  Hemiphere, plus of course \\"Lyra\\" sounds awfully much like \\"liar,\\" which is Lyra Belacqua's main skill (besides reading the alethiometer), and one in which she takes great pride (that is, until the brutal encounter with the Harpy at the gates of the city of the dead!)  Coincidence?  Hmmmm...I don't think so!; and 3) Pullman has borrowed freely from this all-time classic poem by John Milton, \\"Paradise Lost,\\" in creating his own take on Genesis, God, Satan, free will, the temptation in the Garden of Eden, and the \\"Fall\\" of man into\\"Sin\\" (among other things).  In interviews, Phillip Pullman has confirmed that the biblical Creation story, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and \\"Paradise Lost\\" are major sources for \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, and that the title itself comes from the following quote:  &quot;Unless the almighty maker them ordain / His dark materials to create more worlds.&quot;  But don't forget that there is real science behind \\"dark matter\\" - scientists right now are investigating this as a possible force which could help hold the universe together!  <br />Anyway, I strongly recommend that you read Phillip Pullman's magnificent book, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" (and the other two books in the trilogy) whether you want a great story that you won't be able to put down, or whether you want to be challenged, amazed, intrigued, and deeply moved.  And OF COURSE you should read it if you're curious to know more about the ever-enigmatic, but ultimately all-important \\"dust,\\" our final rest and native home....	2001-01-10

In &quot;Finding My Voice,&quot; Diane comes across as the same admirable person we all know from her radio talk show --honest, direct, curious (about ideas and above all about people), down-to-earth, warm, caring, determined (even stubborn) and - despite her lack of a college degree (who cares?!?) - highly intelligent.  In my opinion, the really interesting parts of the book deal less with Spasmodic Dysphonia than with: 1) Diane growing up as a girl in a traditional Arab-American family in the 1940s and early 1950s with a depressed, anxious, abusive mother; 2) the obstacles (professional, personal) which Diane -- and many talented young women -- were forced to overcome to achieve something for themselves in the male-dominated society of the 1950s and 1960s; 3) Diane \\"finding her voice\\" in a growing radio career, and in a broader sense the overall growth of talk radio - for better (\\"The Diane Rehm Show\\" and others where people can have a civilized discussion and actually are encouraged to think for themselves) and for worse (Rush Limbaugh and \\"Dr. Laura\\" - blech - where people berate each other, preach to each other, or mindlessly \\"ditto\\" the host); and 4) Diane's constant struggles to overcome deepseated feelings of insecurity and of not being worthy, despite (or even fueled by) her growing outward success.  <br />Besides that, there are also some memorable moments with some really bizarre/obnoxious guests - Tony Randall and Tom Clancy stand out in particular - and some really excellent ones - Race Hoss and Jimmy Carter, for instance.  And unlike many celebrity autobiographies, in &quot;Finding My Voice&quot; this does not come across -- at least to me -- like mere gratuitous name dropping.  Instead, they are an integral part of Diane's story, illustrating some of the best and worst which she has faced in her radio career.<br />Finally, &quot;Finding my Voice&quot; shows us that -- whatever she may feel about herself (and whether or not she'll ever truly believe it) -- Diane Rehm IS an amazing person who deserves every bit of success and happiness she has achieved in her life.  I'm just thankful that Diane finally DID manage to \\"find her voice,\\" and hope that she doesn't lose it for years and years to come!   P.S. Thank goodness for public radio -- and for everyone who supports it!	2001-01-07

I just finished reading all three of Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" books in a little over a week (I couldn't put them down!), and I'm still trying to absorb all of this.  My initial reaction:  this is going to be an all-time classic, and certainly not just of \\"young adult\\" or \\"fantasy\\" books (Phillip Pullman himself has stated many times that he can't read \\"fantasy,\\" because it \\"doesn't tell [him] anything interesting about being a human being.\\"   While it is certainly different than the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" it is NOT AT ALL ridiculous to place Pullman's creation in the same pantheon as Tolkien's, which is something I swear I never thought that I would say.  Anyway, the bottom line is that this trilogy is an amazing, mind-blowing, fascinating, exciting, heartbreaking, work of transcendent brilliance, and it starts with the story of Lyra, somewhat inaccurately titled, \\"The Golden Compass\\" (I guess that sounds better than \\"The Alethiometer\\" or \\"Lyra vs. the Gobblers\\" or something, but I strongly prefer the British title, \\"Northern Lights\\").  Also, the marketing of this book is very strange - if you look at the cover you might think this was some warm, fuzzy children's adventure story about a girl and her pet bear.  Not!!!  Instead, how about Phillip Pullman's dark take on creation and extended riff on multiple themes raised in John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" and the Book of Genesis.   The bottom line:  if Phillip Pullman is mainly for children, than so are John Milton and the Bible!  I don't think so....<br />Anyway, \\"The Golden Compass\\"/\\"Northern Lights\\" tells the story of a plucky, wild, courageous, amazing 12-year old girl named Lyra Belacqua, her beloved daemon Pantalaimon, her alethiometer (and all that it helps her discover about \\"Dust\\" -- and other things), her powerful, ambitious, complex, and dangerous parents (Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter), political intrigue in a world VERY much like our own in crucial ways, evil experiments on kidnapped children and their daemons, fascinating people called \\"gyptians\\" (water gypsies), theology and the Church, a window on a parallel universe (and the quest to find out what exists there), angels, witches, and an amazing bear named Iorek Byrnison.  Is that enough material for you for one book?  And how about put all that material into the hands of an author who is a great storyteller!  The result, as I've said before: a CLASSIC!!<br />Just three other points.  First, this trilogy inevitably is going to be compared to (and possibly overshadowed by) another \\"young adult\\" series out these days, which you might have heard of...I think it's called, uh, \\"Harry Potter\\" or something like that.  Anyway, not to disparage \\"Harry Potter\\" or anything, because that's a pretty good series of books, but &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is merely a cute, whimsical, well-told tale of a boy and his adventures compared to Phllip Pullman's very dark, amazing, even disturbing creation (especially if you have a closed mind towards explorations of God, religion, the Church and the nature of man - all the interesting and important things, in other words)!<br />Second, I absolutely love Pullman's writing style (what a great storyteller!), as well as his use of words and names.  He apparently has put a LOT of thought into this!  For instance, take the main character, Lyra.  I looked it up in the dictionary and found that \\"Lyra\\" is a constellation in the NORTHERN Hemisphere near Cygnus (\\"northern CROSS\\") and Hercules (child of the highest Greek God, Zeus, and Alcmene, a hero of extraordinary strength who won immortality by performing the 12 labors demanded by Hera).  Interesting...  Also, the constellation \\"Lyra\\" is located near the Corona BOREALIS.  Finally, \\"Lyra\\" sounds awfully much like \\"liar,\\" which is Lyra Belacqua's main skill (besides reading the alethiometer), and one in which she takes great pride.  Coincidence?  Hmmmm...I don't think so!  Also, just to intrigue us further, Pullman names his Lyra'sfather \\"Asriel,\\" which is similar to \\"Israel\\", which according to my dictionary is the name given to Jacob by the angel with whom he wrestled; perhaps literally \\"God struggles\\").  Double hmmmmm!  Finally, we've got Mrs. \\"Coulter,\\" and guess what that means?  Well, according to my trusty dictionary again, a \\"coulter\\" is a BLADE or wheel on a plow for making VERTICAL CUTS in the sod (from Latin culter, KNIFE).  Cool!<br />Third, maybe we all should read (or reread) Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" (and the Book of Genesis) before/after we read \\"The Golden Compass\\", because there's no doubt that Phillip Pullman has borrowed freely from Milton's all-time classic take on Creation, God, Satan, free will, the temptation in the Garden of Eden, and the \\"Fall\\" of man into \\"Sin\\" (among other things).  Before the book even begins, we have an epigraph from \\"Paradise Lost,\\" specifically the scene where Satan surveys the unformed potential of the Creator.  Given this, it should not be surprising to anyone familiar with \\"Paradise Lost\\" (or the Bible, for that matter) that \\"The Golden Compass\\" leads us ever northwards, since the rebel angel, Satan, repaired to the NORTHERN realms.  Meanwhile, don't forget that in \\"Paradise Lost\\" the angels (at God's command) tilt the Earth's axis so that man will have to endure extreme hot and cold seasons, instead of the constant temperate climate which existed before the Fall.  Meanwhile, in \\"Paradise Lost,\\" Sin and Death construct - with God's permission -- a bridge (window?) for easy passageway between Hell and Earth, through which they promise to infect the Earth and to corrupt all living things with Death and Sin.  Veeeerrrry interesting!!!  In interviews, Phillip Pullman has confirmed that the biblical Creation story, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and \\"Paradise Lost\\" are major sources for \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, and that the title itself comes from the following quote:  &quot;Unless the almighty maker them ordain / His dark materials to create more worlds.&quot;  Read \\"The Golden Compass\\" if you want a great story, if you want to be challenged, amazed, intrigued, and moved (as long as you're not one of these strange, closed-minded, disturbing, Oblation Board types who I see here and there on this site criticizing Pullman for &quot;bigotry&quot; or &quot;blasphemy&quot; or some other ridiculous thing!).  And OF COURSE read it if you're curious to know more about \\"dust\\" -- &quot;our final rest and native home...\\"	2000-12-30

And just as the \\"The Golden Compass,\\" can be thought of as being about Lyra (and her beloved daemon, Pantalaimon), \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is mainly about a powerful and fascinating new character, Will Parry.  To my mind, \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is really the key book in the entire trilogy, and possibly the best of all.  As soon as Will steps through the window into Cittàgaze, the beautiful yet terrible &quot;city of magpies&quot;, where only children and horrible soul-suckingspecters live, Pullman's themes begin to really kick into gear.  Perhaps the turning point in the entire trilogy occurs when Will gains possession of the \\"subtle knife\\" (again, a parallel with \\"Paradise Lost,\\" in which the Archangel Michael has a sword which \\"was given him temper'd so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge\\") in the Torre degli Angeli, and learns how to use it, allowing Will and Lyra (his soul mate who immediately trusts him because he is a murderer!) to cut windows through into different universes (the knife has MANY more powers than that, including - possibly - God destroyer!), and opening up a whole range of amazing possibilities for this gifted author -- and his readers... <br />All in all, \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is even richer, more complex, more exciting, and more mind boggling than \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  And extremely complex morally, although some have (falsely) accused Pullman of being anti-religion (Catholicism in particular).  But, really, this is NOT a simple book at all, and Pullman is a great enough author to basically leave it up to YOU to decide whether you agree with statements such as ''every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\\"  In my opinion, at least, Pullman is not preaching or didactic, but just laying out a view of things, which I basically find very satisfying, but which of course some will disagree with...<br />To summarize three points I made in my review of \\"The Golden Compass\\":  1) this is far darker and more disturbing material (especially if you have a closed mind towards explorations of God, religion, the Church and the nature of man - all the interesting and important things, in other words) than the perfectly serviceable \\"Harry Potter\\" books, to which the Pullman trilogy inevitably is going to be compared (this trilogy is far, far greater than Potter!!); 2) Pullman is a master of language, and his use of names (among other things) is fascinating..  \\"Lyra,\\" for instance, is a constellation in the NORTHERN  Hemiphere, plus of course \\"Lyra\\" sounds awfully much like \\"liar,\\" which is Lyra Belacqua's main skill (besides reading the alethiometer), and one in which she takes great pride.

OK, let's start with the good things about this book.  Well, um, uh, hmmmmm.....<br />Well, maybe we should start with the bad things!  As many other reviewers have pointed out, this book is unoriginal, disorganized, undisciplined, all over the place, smug, arrogant, over-earnest, silly, boring, and unintentionally (I think) laughably self-parodying.  And the self-serving mythos that Purdy promotes, that only in a place like West Virginia, away from material things, TV, the public schools (running water, toilets?) can one emerge pure, wholesome, and unironic (if you can even figure out what the word \\"irony\\" means!).  And that the best way to learn, apparently, is to run around fields naked, slathered in mud, stopping to slaughter your pet steer along the way, and definitely not to come close to a public school, even while extolling your mother's service on the local school board.  What on Earth?!?  <br />And, you know, the thing is about Purdy's inexplicably popular book is that it's really a shame and a wasted opportunity, because the subject of \\"common things\\" is an interesting, important one, with a lot of relevance to the world as it enters the 21st century.  As I write this review, for example, debate rages over possible implementation of the Kyoto Treaty, which attempts to address a huge \\"common thing\\" - the Earth's climate!  In environmental economics terminology, carbon emissions have long been an \\"externality\\" (i.e., a \\"common thing\\" not taken into account by the market), but now there is talk of a carbon trading scheme, which would essentially put a price on a ton of carbon, thus \\"internalizing\\" it.  This is just ONE example of an important \\"common thing.\\"   Others include global health (or lack thereof in the case of the AIDS epidemic, for instance), rule of law, nuclear non-proliferation and international stability in general, biodiversity, Democracy, and human rights.  <br />Anyway, the point is that \\"common things\\" are often VERY important, but Jedediah Purdy's disorganized hodgepodge of a book just makes them seem ridiculous, or muddle-headed leftist thinking, or the product of too many drugs taken by 60s hippies or something!  And that's unironically a shame!	2000-12-11
US	49404909	R1SYOXMUZFK0W1	0865475571	690664705	Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream	Books	5	30	36	N	N	Suburban wasteland...and what to do about it!	For decades now, America has been engaged in mindless, self-destructive \\"sprawl,\\" poor (or nonexistent) planning, and social engineering on a massive scale (largely begun in the Cold War, with the intent of fighting and winning a nuclear war, believe it or not!).   In this wonderful, sensible, well-reasoned, non-dogmatic book, the authors dissect the mess that we have created and offer practical solutions to build healthy, beautiful, livable communities again.  Personally, I would describe this book more as \\"pro-community\\" and \\"pro-neighborhood\\" than \\"anti\\" anything - sprawl, suburbia - although those are worth opposing for the many, many reasons which the authors lay out.  I bet you didn't know, for instance, all the reasons why suburbia actually is NOT, as the cliché goes, a \\"great place to raise a family.\\"  For one thing, far more kids are killed and maimed each year in automobile accidents, which are largely a suburban phenomenon, and suicide (which is exacerbated by alienating, isolating, sterile, autonomy-robbing, soulless subdivisions) then by inner city crime.  And I don't think it's exactly a coincidence that ALL the school shootings over the past couple of years have been carried out by typical, bored, suburban kids with way too much time on their hands.  Hmmmmm.....     Although the subject matter might not seem too exciting at first glance, this book is actually highly readable, fascinating, and a great introduction for the non-technical person as to how we got where we are today in the way we live - and how to improve it!  Besides architecture, history, and sociology, the authors offer numerous real-world examples from their extensive experiences which makes things come to life in a vivid way.  <br />Among other things, the authors describe how the automobile came to dominate to such a ridiculous, even comical (if it weren't so pathetic) degree in America, and how automobile travel is subsidized to such a huge extent that the true price of gasoline should probably be about $9 per gallon, if all the subsidies, pollution, medical treatment necessitated by car-related injuries, etc. were paid for at the pump.  Instead, we pay the cheapest price for gasoline in the world, and - as a percent of income - nearly the lowest in our history.  Unfortunately, even though these costs ARE paid by us all (one way or the other), pandering to car owners in suburbia continues to work politically.  In my state of Virginia, for instance, the current governor came to power largely by promising \\"no car tax\\" - the exact opposite of what \\"Suburban Nation\\" recommends we should be doing if we want to have livable communities and a society that works for everyone.<br />Besides our bizarre love affair with the automobile, the authors of \\"Suburban Nation\\" contrast traditional neighborhoods--&quot;mixed-used, pedestrian-friendly communities&quot; --where people of diverse backgrounds and economic levels interact, work, eat, play, and deal with each other (what a concept!), with suburbia, where housing, work, shopping, and public facilities are segregated from one another, so people are forced to drive everywhere, and where you might never have to deal with anyone much different (racially, economically) than yourself.   What's important to realize, and the authors of \\"Suburban Nation\\" lay this out powerfully, is, just because things have been like this for several decades, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, and things can be so much better!  The bottom line is, we MADE it this way through government policy, powerful special interests (the automobile industry, big oil, road builders), and even racism.  <br />Who suffers from all this?   All Americans, basically, although of course the poor, the elderly, and children (i.e., those who are the least able to fight back and least powerful) suffer the worst, as usual.  Plus, of course, the cities suffer, as does the environment, and all of our quality of life.  <br />Reading this book got me energized and even inspired.  I always knew I didn't like suburbia, and I got out of it as quickly as I could, but after reading \\"Suburban Nation,\\" I now can explain exactly what was bothering me!  I recommend that everyone who cares about their community and their quality of life (which should be everyone, I would think!) - get this book and read it.   I bet you'll look at your own neighborhood differently after you're done!!	2000-12-11

In \\"Eastward to Tartary,\\" Robert Kaplan, author of the classic \\"Balkan Ghosts\\" and several other excellent books, doesn't sugarcoat things, that's for sure, as he explores the \\"New Near East\\" (the corpses of two major empires -- the Ottoman and the Soviet) and writes back to inform us how the rotting is going.   Personally, I think we should all be thankful to Kaplan for traveling to some of these hellholes and reporting back to us so, if for nothing else, so WE don't have to go there ourselves (just kidding)!  We are also lucky that Kaplan, with his keen eye, tenacity, persistence, courage, and fine journalistic skills, is there to give us the uncomfortable truths that most of us would prefer to ignore or gloss over.  As Kaplan modestly  puts it, his goal is to \\"discover the obvious\\" - obvious, though, only if you are willing (and skillful enough) to really look for it, and most Western journalists aren't willing or able.   Luckily for us, Kaplan is both!<br />\\"Eastward to Tartary\\" is bracing, as have been all of Kaplan's books, and not for the weak of stomach!  Whether or not you like what he has to say, you have to admit that Kaplan has vast knowledge and wisdom and cuts right to the chase - no bull.  Reading Kaplan, I kept thinking:  this guy is the anti-Friedman!  No cloying cuteness, no wonders of globalization for Kaplan, and no rhapsodizing over the wonders of shopping malls and McDonalds either.  Thank goodness!  Instead, Kaplan writes clearly, brutally honestly, without sentimentality, glibness, or cuteness.  Kaplan is NOT an optimist, and I mean this as a compliment.  Instead, Kaplan is a clear-eyed realist, and, as Michael Ignatieff calls him, a \\"travel writer from hell\\" (that's a compliment, too, by the way!)   Many Americans, steeped in naïve, mushy, rose-colored, and even dangerous optimism, would probably call him a pessimist by way of dismissing him because they don't WANT to believe what he has to say.   But just because Kaplan is a disturbing messenger, that doesn't mean that we should shoot him (metaphorically speaking, of course)!  As Kaplan himself puts it, \\"a viewpoint is not necessarily inaccurate because it happens to be morally risky or pessimistic, especially if it helps explain phenomena that are otherwise unexplainable.\\"<br />Kaplan's stress on the salience of history is a jarring contrast with mainstream American thought, which tends strongly towards the \\"history is bunk\\" school.  Kaplan also disillusions us of the mushy notion that if only everyone could be globalized, then everyone would be peaceful liberal democrats and we'd be at the \\"end of history\\".  NOT!<br />Kaplan is successful in part because of HOW he travels - slowly, by land or sea, mainly.  As he puts it, \\"the essence of travel was to slow the passage of time.  One could fly...but \\"flying from place to place encourages abstractions, whereas land travel brings one face-to-face with basic, sometimes unpleasant truths.  I preferred to travel by second-class car and stay in cheap hotels...[because] it allowed me to go on learning.\\"  <br />So what does Kaplan learn?  That \\"national character\\" matters.  That \\"absurd personality cults\\" are alive and well in many of these places.  That \\"the idea that the Internet and other technologies annihilates distances is a half-truth.\\"  That communism/ authoritarianism are not NECESSARILY all bad (at least they provided pensions, schooling, and social peace), and that liberal democracy/capitalism/free markets are not NECESSARILY all good or an end in and of themselves (especially if it's the local thugs and Mafiosi who benefit).  That nothing is \\"determined in advance,\\" but that leadership, history and geography (the \\"olive trees\\" in Friedman's formulation) DO matter.  That the West probably could \\"never muster\\" the \\"sheer appetite for power\\" necessary to remake this part of the world.  That \\"morality is a funny thing,\\" and that sometimes the former \\"idealistic dissident\\" can end up destroying his country, while the ex-communist hack or secret policeman can end up saving it.  That irredentism (Azeri, Turkmen, etc.) is alive and well at the start of the 21st century.  That it may be only \\"the impermanence of bad governments\\" that gives one any hope at all for many of these places.  That, in many of the places that he visits, Western influence extends for only a few blocks in the capital city, while the countryside is ruled by gangs and thugs, with only the faintest sign of the West.  That there are plenty of rootless, unemployed, disoriented young men out there just ripe for the picking of terrorist groups, religious fanatics, mafias, and nationalistic armies.  And that ecological and cultural devastation are long-lasting consequences of the collapse the Soviet Union.<br />So what does Kaplan recommend that we DO about this screwed-up part of the world?   It's hard to tell...maybe he doesn't really know.  Or, maybe, Kaplan is a specialist - he calls `em like he sees `em, but leaves it to other specialists to figure out what to do with `em!  Anyway, MY recommendation is that you read this book, if you want to understand the world we live in today, and, most likely, it's future...	2000-12-05
US	49404909	R3IY92O17LR1ZQ	0684863030	622691915	The Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats the Childless	Books	4	64	72	N	N	No taxation for others' procreation!	Burkett comes on strong - maybe too strong for the good of her overall argument, which is fundamentally a strong one - at the beginning of her book, \\"The Baby Boon.\\"  The first chapter or two, for instance, are like a thesaurus entry listing synonyms for \\"angry\\" -- peeved, pique, disgust, gall, hostility (towards \\"breeders\\"), irritated, perturbed, resentment, \\"backlash\\", lament, frustration.  We hear stories about how women have been discriminated against for decades, with little discussion of the vast changes - largely for the better, it seems to me - in recent decades.  Burkett also goes a little overboard, I would say, in comparing society's antipathy towards non-parents with homophobia and anti-Semitism.  I don't think there's anyone out there calling for \\"death to the non-parents!\\"  However, it seems to me that Burkett is RIGHT ON in her indictment of society's pervasive assumption that all women will reproduce, the granting of privileges to those who do so, and the denial of those privileges to non-\\"breeders.\\"  So, try not to let the somewhat shrill tone of the book's early part keep you from hearing Burkett out!<br />What Burkett describes throughout \\"The Baby Boon\\" is essentially an example of the dreaded \\"tyranny of the majority\\" - in this case, parents -- not just over resources and power, but even over thought and morality.  In other words, \\"pro-natalism\\" run amok.  In Burkett's view (and mine), if you want to have a family, good for you, but you need to respect those who DON'T choose to do so as well, not treat them as somehow failed human beings, selfish, or defective, and not ask them to subsidize YOUR personal choice.  This all really comes down to a few simple questions with far-reaching implications.  Does, or does not, society value parents more than non-parents?   Is society willing to force non-parents to subsidize parents in their \\"expensive hobby\\" (child rearing)?  Do parents really \\"deserve special privilege for the unique contribution they make to us all?\\"  Is reproduction even a social good at all, or is it more of a bad thing (or at best neutral) in our wildly overpopulated world? <br />Burkett describes the mind-boggling plethora of private and public sector benefits (childcare, maternity and paternity leave, special schedules, camps, scholarships, seminars, direct cash payments \\"to help out with the expenses\\", etc.) for parents.  And who subsidizes all this?  Obviously, the money has to come - at least in part -- from those without children.  Not surprisingly, \\"single and childless [people] feel discriminated against and \\"shafted\\" because they can't take advantage of benefits created for the family.\\"  Also not surprisingly, parents who reap all these benefits don't want to give them up, and when confronted with the resentment they are \\"breeding,\\" they change the topic or wax moralistic about how raising children is a \\"holy calling that lifts them up...above the rest of us mere mortals\\"  (either that, or they are just \\"willfully clueless about the inequities they are creating.\\").  The bottom line, in Burkett's view, is the not-particularly-radical view that EVERYONE - \\"women or men...pregnant...in a wheelchair...should get the same benefits\\" and be treated equally.  In other words, no taxation for others' procreation!!<br />Politicians (of all political stripes - from the \\"Christian Right\\" to the liberal left) in recent years have raised the art of pandering to those with children (as long as they are middle class or above that is, and preferably white - nobody seems to care particularly much about poor people or minorities, even though one in five children live below the poverty line) -- to an art form.  President Clinton, for instance, has pushed for making parents yet another \\"protected class\\" (like religion, race, age, sex, disability, etc.).  Just what we need (not!).  And seemingly every proposal these days apparently must be couched in terms of \\"children,\\" to an almost laughable extent (protect your children from nuclear terrorists - build Star Wars now!\\").  Motherhood today is the ultimate in political correctness, even among many feminists.  And woe unto him or her who dares to question the saintly mothers of the world (and all their tax breaks).  The fact is, though, that having children is a CHOICE.  Disappointing (even enraging) as this concept apparently is to many, Burkett points out what should be obvious to any mature adult - you actually CAN'T \\"have it all,\\" and life is all about making tradeoffs.  If you think that having children is so great, and have freely chosen to do so, then why should you resent making the needed tradeoffs?  And why should you feel a need to proselytize or penalize non-parents?  <br />A major irony of all the benefits given to parents, as Burkett describes in great detail, is that today in America, the AVERAGE (middle class or up) child actually is far better off than he HAS EVER BEEN (healthier, wealthier, safer, with relatively low rates of smoking, alcohol abuse, and drug addiction as well).  Most children, according to the National Commission on Children, \\"belong to warm, loving families\\" and are \\"healthy, hopeful, and able to meet the challenges of adult life.\\"  So what is all the clamoring to \\"help\\" children of middle class (and upper class) families?  Basically, it appears to be pure political pandering (\\"affirmative action for parents\\"), with many parents seemingly believing themselves \\"entitled\\" to reward for their great \\"sacrifice\\" (which they freely chose, of course) of raising the next generation of children.  Well, if it's such a sacrifice or so horrible, then why on earth did they have children?  And if it's not so wonderful, then why are they constantly be trying to persuade non-parents to become parents?  Misery loves company, perhaps?  Or is this all just another manifestation of America's culture today, where everyone is a victim, everyone has a grievance, and everyone is \\"owed\\" something?  Whatever itis, according to Burkett, the \\"Baby Boon\\" is no boon at all to the millions of \\"childfree\\" out there.  And not surprisingly, they don't like it one bit...hence books like this!  Is anyone listening out there?!?	2000-12-03
US	49404909	RCHJ0ISL3OL0V	0809089068	518265730	Strange Victory: Hitler's Conquest of France	Books	5	19	25	N	N	&quot;Revisionist history&quot; at its finest:  an important book	At its best, what is known as \\"revisionist history\\" helps us look at an historical event from a different, stimulating, even important perspective.  Unfortunately, \\"revisionist history\\" has developed something of a bad reputation in recent years, due mainly to some bizarre cases of people actually DENYING that an event, in particular the Nazi Holocaust, occurred at all.  It's one thing to say that if Lee had won at Gettysburg, then the South would have won the Civil War, but it's another thing to deny that the Civil War ever happened!  Fortunately, denial is not at all what \\"Strange Victory\\" is about.  Instead, this is \\"revisionist history\\" at its best - brilliant, wise, troubling, even mind-boggling.  If Ernest May is correct, than all of history could easily have turned out far differently, if only...<br />Basically, what Ernest May does in \\"Strange Victory\\" is to present a well-argued case that the Nazi victory over France in 1940 not only was far from inevitable - in a Hegelian, Marxist, or any other sense -- but if anything that the ALLIES should have defeated the NAZIS - and fairly easily, at that!  <br />Personally, I think the interesting question with a lot of history is why do people so often take it as a given that just because something happened, that it was preordained to happen and/or could not have happened otherwise?  And yet, we know that random events like weather (for instance, fog on the East River on the night of Aug. 29, 1776, which permitted Washington to escape unnoticed by the British and thus keep the Revolution alive to fight another day; or the terrible Russian winter of 1941/1942 helped prevent the Nazis from conquering the Soviet Union; the death of Alexander the Great; etc.) can have tremendous implications for the course of history.  <br />Basically, this comes down to two opposing views: 1) the Hegelian/Marxist view that history is \\"inevitable\\", or at least deterministic in the sense that it is driven by forces that humans have little control over; and 2) the view that there is little, if anything, preordained about history, and that the belief in inevitability really stems from things like \\"hindsight bias,\\" which makes history appear far more pre-ordained than it really is.  In \\"Strange Victory,\\" Ernest May offers us an excellent example of the second category of analysis, helping us to, as Oxford scholar (and author of the controversial revisionist history, \\"The Pity of War\\") Niall Ferguson puts it, \\"recapture the chaotic nature of experience and see that there are no certain outcomes.&quot;  The bottom line is that just because something happened a certain way doesn't mean it HAD to have happened that way, and the Nazi victory over France in 1940, as laid out in \\"Strange Victory,\\" is one of those cases.<br />So how, then, does May explain (as he puts it) the question: \\"if the Allies in May 1940 were in most respects militarily superior, were not badly led, and did not suffer from demoralization (not yet, at least), what then accounts for Germany's six-week triumph?\\"  First, May persuasively discounts the three generally accepted explanations: 1) moral \\"laxness\\" and an unwillingness to fight on the Allied side (according to May, the French and British were confident, expected to win, fought well and courageously, won battles, and suffered many casualties); 2) a crushing German military superiority (the Allies actually were better equipped for war, according to May); and 3) far better German than allied leadership (May presents plenty of evidence of incompetence on both sides and at all levels).<br />What then, led to the Nazis' swift victory?  To quote May, \\"More than anything else, this happened because France and its allies misjudged what Germany planned to do. If leaders in the Allied governments had anticipated the German offensive through the Ardennes, even as a worrisome contingency, it is almost inconceivable that France would have been defeated when and as it was. It is more than conceivable that the outcome would have been not France's defeat but Germany's and, possibly, a French victory parade on the Unter den Linden in Berlin.\\"  <br />Of course, this raises the next question:  WHY did the Allies so badly misjudge the situation, even with excellent intelligence (including spies in the German government high up in the German intelligence apparatus) and May explains this as well, pretty much in one word:  arrogance.  Specifically, the Allies were overconfident, disbelieving that Hitler would dare launch a \\"reckless land offensive\\" against the more powerful Allies, and certainly not in the way that he did!  Besides arrogance, May raises another interesting factor, namely the Allied concern with minimizing loss of life (largely in reaction to the carnage experienced only one generation earlier), and the related heavy reliance on technology (the \\"Maginot Line\\") as a substitute for manpower.  Sound familiar?  Well, if not, you might want to check out specifically the \\"Powell Doctrine\\" and in general the post-Vietnam War reluctance by the United States to risk casualties, plus the heavy U.S. reliance on technology - whether it be \\"stealth\\", \\"smart bombs\\", airpower, \\"Star Wars,\\" or whatever.  This was in great evidence during \\"Operation Desert Storm,\\" as well as in the Kosovo campaign.  Finally, May, in what I find to be his weakest point, cites the inherent nature of democracies, which generally have a more \\"cumbersome\\" (and time-consuming) decision making process than non-democracies.<br />In sum, this is a fascinating, important book, with relevance for today's policymaking.  Personally, I strongly recommend that our top military and political leaders read this book and absorb its lessons, or someday soon we too could become the victims of a \\"Strange Victory\\"...	2000-11-04

US	49404909	R2HD199N0N9TN	0618002219	669379389	The Hobbit: or There and Back Again	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A classic camouflaged as a &quot;children's book&quot; (NOT!)	First of all, let's dispose of a couple of widely-held beliefs about \\"The Hobbit\\".  First, this book was written as its own story, stands very well on its own, and is far from being merely a \\"prequel\\" to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  Second, although children certainly can read \\"The Hobbit\\" and enjoy it, this book can be read on more levels - and possibly with even greater pleasure -- by adults.  So, to call \\"The Hobbit\\" a \\"children's book\\" is neither particularly accurate nor helpful.  The fact that there's been a great deal of serious literary criticism written on \\"The Hobbit\\" should tell you something right there!  Personally, I have read this book nearly a dozen times, starting when I was in college and just about annually for more than 15 years afterwards, and I still feel that I have not fully exhausted this book nor outgrown it.  In fact, I very well may read it another dozen times in my life.  Who knows?<br />Now, what about the book?  On one level, this is a fairly straightforward  -- and excellent -- adventure story, with plenty of action, colorful characters (good, bad, and in-between), suspense, treachery, fighting, treasure, etc.  On another level, this is also a kind of Freud meets Harry Potter \\"coming of age\\" story, beginning metaphorically in the womb (Bilbo Baggin's tunnel-like, comfortable, safe \\"hole in the ground\\") and ending up with Bilbo progressing via a series of challenges through childhood (burglar), into young adulthood (adventurer, with his new-found sword named \\"Sting\\" - hmmm, Freud thinks...sometimes a sword is just a sword?!?), and finally into full maturity (leader/hero).  Contrast the beginning of the book, where Bilbo runs practically naked (\\"to the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a walking-stick, or any money\\" or even his \\"pocket-handkerchiefs\\") out of his womb..er, hobbit hole, and the end of the book, where he returns much changed (\\"not the hobbit that you were,\\" according to Gandalf the wizard) and totally grown up (actually, presumed DEAD, with his possessions in the process of being auctioned off).  So, in sum, this is an adventure story/coming of age book, which takes us from the main character's birth to his (symbolic) death, with lots of interesting life in between.<br />But, if that was all there were to \\"The Hobbit,\\" it would not be the classic that it is, but merely an entertaining, well-written book, mainly for children.  Instead, \\"The Hobbit\\" rises to a totally different - and much higher -- level on the basis of several factors: 1) the author, JRR Tokien, Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford and an expert in linguistics and early English literature, Beowulf for instance, creates a work of tremendous scholarship, great thought and care -- well camouflaged as a \\"children's story\\" -- and, as CS Lewis wrote in 1937, \\"a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology;\\" 2) this is a great work of imagination, which essentially imagines a world - Middle Earth - in many ways similar to our own world, and in other ways quite different; and 3) there is a lot of really interesting stuff bubbling beneath the surface here, some of which Tolkien hints at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" and much of which is developed further in his two other great works, \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  For instance, although great evils (and in fact the origin of evil - and much else) are hinted at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" they are left mainly for further development in other places.  However, this does not lessen \\"The Hobbit,\\" per se, just gives it a sort of subconscious depth which is not often found in \\"children's books.\\"<br />Just to provide one further illustration of how this is not merely a \\"simple children's book,\\" let's think about this for a minute in quasi-Marxist socioeconomic terms.  Basically, what you have here is a comfortable bourgeois community of Hobbits - fat, lazy, happy, contented, ignorant, and kind of stupid.  Then you have abunch of mercantalist/proto-capitalist Dwarves enter the picture, who draw one of the bored-out-of- his-mind Hobbits (Bilbo) out of his comfortable hole and in search of their plundered (and now unproductive) capital, being closely guarded by the ultimate robber-baron, the Dragon.  Other interesting creatures from this perspective are the \\"cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted,\\" machine-making, worker-exploiting Capitalists, er, Goblins (\\"they make many clever [things]...or get...prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light [to make]\\").  And guess what this all leads to, as Marx predicted?  War, of course, which in this case is ultimately won (barely) by an unlikely alliance of the Dwarf and Elf proto-capitalists (led by various monarchs), the mercantilists/petty bourgoisie of Lake-town, and mysterious Other Forces (Beorn, the Eagles, Gandalf the Wizard).  And, of course, lots of workers/proletariat types die in this war (which does, in the end, result in a long period of peace in Middle Earth).  Given all this, is it any wonder that \\"The Hobbit\\" really became popular in the 1960s Vietnam War era?<br />Anyway, this is just a partly serious, partly tongue-in-cheek example of why I think \\"The Hobbit\\" is a great book (like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), worthy of numerous readings, by both children and adults alike.  The thing about great literature is that different people can get different things out of it.  So, read this book, then read it again (and again), and, to paraphrase Tolkien, \\"see whether [you have] gained anything in the end.\\"bunch of mercantalist/proto-capitalist Dwarves enter the picture, who draw one of the bored-out-of- his-mind Hobbits (Bilbo) out of his comfortable hole and in search of their plundered (and now unproductive) capital, being closely guarded by the ultimate robber-baron, the Dragon.

US	49404909	R22R9RJ0MZZABL	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	4	284	355	N	N	A &quot;must-read&quot; for sci-fi fans, although somewhat overrated	I think the fact that there are over 480 reviews of this book on Amazon.com, almost all of them 5 stars, tells you something - this book is one of the best-loved sci-fi books in existence, inspiring an almost cult-like following.  And no doubt Dune IS a fine work of epic fiction (\\"a cast of thousands\\"), but it is definitely not perfect, as many reviews would have you believe.   Let's start with the many positives: in Dune, Frank Herbert has created a complex, richly-textured, fascinating, internally consistent (for the most part), other world.  The world comes complete with it's own fascinating politics, economics, awareness of ecology (specifically, the importance of water), language (largely borrowed from Arabic), mythologies, good guys and bad guys (of course), heroes, traitors, etc.  And it's a rip-roaring story which is almost impossible to put down!<br />What you also get in Dune is a whole hodgepodge (sometimes confusing, sometimes ready to fly apart at the seams) of Zen-influenced philosophy, Machiavellian political intrigue (rival houses, the Emperor, CHOAM, the Bene Gesserit \\"witches\\", Mentats, spys, assassins, etc.), Arab-influenced desert culture and language, ecology, \\"planetology\\" (and Kynes, the Imperial planetologist) mysticism and religion aplenty, human psychology, a whole inter-galactic economic system (based on \\"spice\\"), and Star Wars-quality adventure.  Whether or not this all manages to hold together is a good question, and I basically (with reservations) think it does, this book is really not comparable to any other that I know of, exactly.  And things are not as \\"black and white\\" as they seem at first glance - although the Harkonnens ARE really nasty and the Atreides ARE really good (the Fremen and others tend to be far more ambiguous).  And of course, there is possibly Herbert's greatest creation, the giant sandworms (\\"makers\\"), and the precious \\"spice\\" produced by them without which the whole empire would fall apart.   Paul Atreides himselfis a smart, likeable, charismatic character, and is basically an excellent example of a the somewhat cliched \\"boy comes of age and grows into a man\\" character.  Actually, Paul's growth in this novel is not just from boy to man, but actually further, to something way beyond (almost superhuman), namely the Kwisatz Haderach - the man (can't be a woman, for somewhat obscure reasons which come awfully close to nonsensical psychobabble) who can see where others cannot, and who bridges space and time.  <br />I DO find the whole concept of being able to \\"see the future\\" fascinating the way Herbert presents it, not simplistically at all, but as a dynamic process whereby, like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the very act of observing something changes it.   In fact, Herbert's view of the future (and the past) is basically an incredibly complex set of possibilities converging at a nexus point (in Dune, it's mainly Paul Muad'Dib) and subject to change via the slightest move.  How does Paul remain sane with such knowledge and such a \\"terrible burden\\"?  How is he able to act and not remain paralyzed with fear when he knows that anything he does might unleash a galaxy-wide \\"jihad\\"?  That's all really interesting stuff, and Herbert generally handles it well.<br />Now here are the main problems (far fewer than the positives, and if you are one of the &quot;cult&quot; people, you might not want to read this!) with \\"Dune\\": 1) sometimes Herbert gets carried away with all the mystical/philosophical mumbo-jumbo and jargon (seems brilliant when you're 16, sort of like \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", but give it a couple of decades and see what you think then!); 2) Herbert sometimes forgets that his characters are just people, not superbeings, which I think makes them less believable and harder to relate to (unlike, let's say, Frodo in the Lord of the Rings); 3) all of the plot twists -- the \\"feints within feints within feints\\" can at times get a little confusing/tedious, even after multiple readings; 4) all this \\"terrible purpose\\" stuff can get annoying and a little over-the-top and silly at times (sometimes I feel like saying &quot;c'mon Frank, lighten up a little bit!&quot;); and 5) Herbert is an adequate, but certainly not a great prose stylist.  <br />But, all that said (cultists can start to read again now), Dune is still an excellent book and well worth reading, probably several times, each time on a different level (there are many here in this multi-layered book). Definitely DON'T waste your time on the awful movie (unless you're a big Sting fan), and also I would say avoid the sequels as well (I've read most of them).  Frank Herbert had one first-rate (despite its flaws) book in him, and this is the one!  Essential reading for any sci-fi fan.	2000-10-21
US	49404909	R2ZRPIKR1RUSIU	0679772685	810809476	Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust	Books	5	48	77	N	N	Uncomortable, disturbing, but that doesn't mean he's wrong!!	What is it about Daniel Goldhagen's book that stirs up such controversy?  Could it be that Goldhagen is wrong in his central thesis, or did he get the facts wrong, or is he biased, or does he choose his evidence selectively to prove his point, or did he ignore important other explanations in an obsessive focus on all things German?  Or, perhaps, could it be that the controversy stirred up by Goldhagen's book is NOT that he is wrong at all, but that he basically is RIGHT, and that this is deeply disturbing to many people.  Because if Goldhagen is right, that means that ORDINARY people (specifically, the Germans in Goldhagen's case, although the way I read Goldhagen, \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" really could have been any \\"ordinary\\" people, like you and me for instance, and not NECESSARILY Germans) are almost inherently evil (or at least naturally inclined towards hatred and violence towards another race, religion, ethnic group, etc.), and need essentially no encouragement whatsoever (so much for the \\"few evil leaders\\" theory, Stanley Milgram's \\"obedience experiment,\\" the \\"banality of evil,\\" etc.) to commit the most despicable, heinous acts against people who never did anything to them, and who pose no tangible (as opposed to psychological) threat to them.  That's a disturbing view of human nature - people not only killing, but killing spontaneously, for fun, and even with pride (posing for pictures with the victims, for instance).  All because they have projected all their own inadequacies, self-loathing, frustrations, etc. onto another people.  This is all very disturbing, yes, and hard to accept (much easier to accept that the Holocaust was the result of a few evil leaders and a coerced or slavishly obedient population), but just because he's hit a raw nerve doesn't mean that Goldhagen's incorrect!     So, the important questions here are: 1) does Goldhagen get his facts right; 2) does Goldhagen draw the correct conclusions from his evidence; and 3) how does Goldagen's thesis compare/contrast with other attempts in the literature at explaining the Holocaust?<br />As far as the first question is concerned, while it is certainly possible (if not probable) that Goldhagen has gotten some details wrong, it seems impossible that the vast majority of his facts, which after all come from all kinds of documents (the Nazis were nothing if not meticulous) as well the killers' own words, pictures (often of proud killers and degraded victims), diaries, etc., could possibly be erroneous.  Let's just assume for the sake of argument that most of Goldhagen's facts are correct (if somewhat selective) and proceed to the analytical conclusions.<br />The second question (does Goldhagen draw the correct conclusions from his evidence) is probably the crux of the controversy here.  Personally, I believe that he does for the most part.  Can anyone really deny that Germans were infused with anti-Semitism, combined with other grievances stemming from World War I, and a shaky sense of national identity, and that Germany was a potentially powerful country which COULD, if it chose to, carry out a Holocaust (unlike, say, Poland or Lithuania, which were anti-semitic but not powerful)?  In a way, my reaction to Goldhagen's book if it weren't for all the controversy, would be \\"duh\\"!  You mean \\"ordinary\\" people can be really nasty to others?  Especially when they are given all the encouragement in the world, and told that another group (Jews in this case, but it could be Blacks, Indians, Gays, or any other group).  Hmmm, didn't we all learn that in, like, 3rd grade?!?   I guess the main question is:  was \\"eliminationist anti-semitism\\" only a NECESSARY condition of the Holocaust, or was it also a SUFFICIENT condition.  I guess in that area, and this is a weakness (although not a deadly one) of \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" Goldhagen could have been somewhat more definitive.<br />I guess the major questions I would have liked Goldhagen to address even more(but maybe that's for another book):  1) if anti-Semitism was widespread not only in Germany (it was arguably even worse in places like Lithuania, Latvia, and Croatia), then why did GERMANY per se (as opposed to these other countries) perpetuate the Holocaust?  Why, for instance, didn't the Poles kill all their Jews, especially since they had a lot more of them than Germany did and arguably just as much, if not more, anti-semitism!  Is there something inherent or unique to Germany that caused Nazism to arise there, or could this have happened just about anywhere?;  2) Although 100,000 or more \\"ordinary Germans\\" participated in the Holocaust, that's still a small fraction of the German population. How aware were the vast majority of Germans as to what was happening, and how intimidated did they feel about taking any action against the Nazis?; 3) Why didn't the rest of the world do more to save the Jews? Was the rest of the world almost as bad as the Nazis?;  and 4) How does the Holocaust differ qualitatively from other atrocities in recent centuries, like the European destruction of Native Americans, the mass enslavement (and killing) of Africans, the Turkish mass killing of Armenians, the Cambodian Khmer Rouge mass killings of their own people, and in very recent years the situations in Bosnia and Rwanda?  Are we talking about differences in ideology, history, or something else?<br />As far as the third question is concerned, Goldhagen's book, while not TOTALLY original (of course, what is?), is basically very different than most explanations of the Holocaust.  Perhaps this is in part because Goldhagen's book was written primarily AFTER the end of the Cold War, when it was no longer so important (and convenient) to gloss over German atrocities so as to enlist Germany on our side against the \\"evil empire?\\"   Perhaps also it is just the inadequacy of saying that \\"people are prone to obey authority\\" or that there is a \\"totalitarian temptation,' or somehow that people who believe something (like killing innocent people) is wrong can be brought to kill. Especially given that we live in a world which has seen the Soviet empire (and other dictatorships) fall apart, and generally a widespread movement towards \\"liberal democracy\\" and the \\"end of history\\" as Frances Fukayama would say, how can we still believe that people will not rise up against something they deeply oppose (assuming they really oppose it)?  In the case of Nazi Germany, despite evidence of opposition to many other policies by Germans, there is miniscule evidence of significant opposition to arguably its worst policy of all -- eliminationist anti-Semitism.  Perhaps Goldhagen's different  new approach also is a natural evolution of Holocaust analysis.  First, scholars tended to focus on the top leaders.  Then, they turned their focus to the victims.  It was only then that they finally could get around to focusing on the rank-and-file perpetrators of the Holocaust.<br />No doubt, Goldhagen's conclusions are just plain uncomfortable for people to deal with.  A few evil leaders and a basically coerced population acting under duress (the prevailing view for most of the post-Holocasut period) is bad enough, but that literally hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in a \\"civilized\\" country in the middle of Europe could just practically overnight become a bunch of sadistic, homicidal, VOLUNTARY, even enthusiastic murderers is deeply disturbing.  Also, the concept that rationality and the \\"thin veneer of civilization\\" can so easily be overcome by irrationality and appeals to a sort of neo-pagan definition of nation (\\"blood and soil\\", the German \\"volk\\") is also frightening.  Finally, the idea that Christianity, which theoretically should have been violently opposed to Nazism, AT BEST was a neutral party, but certainly did not stop the Nazis, cannot be comforting to any thinking Christian.  In sum, it is extremely disturbing to think that a combination of science, modern technology, philosophy (\\"survival of the fittest\\", racial Darwinism, the \\"Superman\\", etc.), Christianity's age-old Jew hatred, the power of the nation-state, a revival of neo-pagan mythology, anti-intellectualism, Germany's difficult search for a unifying identity, and basically just nasty, sadistic human beings infused with all this, combined to kill millions of people in the middle of Europe in the middle of the 20th century.  <br />The bottom line question is this, over a half century after the holocaust took place:  HOW could the Holocaust have happened?  If Daniel Goldhagen is correct, the answer lies not in a few evil leaders, or a bunch of zombie-like authority followers, but in ORDINARY people (albeit infused through and through with a virulent strain of anti-semitism).  <br />Does Goldhagen answer all the questions of the Holocaust?  Of course not.  That would be well-nigh impossible, and Goldhagen explicitly says he isn't trying to do that.  But his focus on the ordinary perpetrators is extremely interesting, and unsettling.  All in all, Goldhagen provides some highly credible, if disturbing, answers.	2000-10-21

That's the word that comes to mind when I think about Kim Stanley Robinson sitting down one day and saying, \\"hmmm, I think I'll write a detailed, scientifically rigorous, realistic book (actually trilogy) about the human colonization of another planet -specifically, Mars.  And besides the science and technology of it, I'll basically write a 'how to' guide, listing all the potential problems, in terms of politics, philosophy, economics, sociology, ecology, and human psychology.   Finally, I'll explore how developments on Earth affect the Martian colonization effort, and vice versa.  And, finally, I'll make all this both intelligent enough to be read by a scientist and understandable (and entertaining) enough for the average reader.  No problem! &quot;  <br />And somehow, for the most part, Kim Stanley Robinson pulls it off.  Sure, the characters can be one-dimensional and even grating and annoying, the plot can get confusing (and melodramatic at times - epic upheaval, rivalries, loves, friendships forming and falling to pieces - yikes, sounds like a bad romance novel!), and the whole book sometimes feels like it's about to come crashing down like the space elevator (Robinson is NOT a great narrative writer, that's for sure!), but still....what a vision, what an ambitious undertaking, what a tremendous amount of research obviously went into this, and what a fascinating subject!  This is true SCIENCE fiction, and a credible vision (even a blueprint) for what human colonization of Mars (and the future of Earth) could be like in the not-too-distant future.  Personally, after reading (I admit, sometimes it felt like slogging through) this book, I now believe that human colonization of Mars is realistic, not just a dream, and with technology now in existence, under development, or within our g rasp in the coming decades (nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, etc.)  Finally, after reading \\"Red Mars\\" I came to believe that is not only FEASIBLE to colonize Mars, but probably (I still have my doubts, especially if we just make the same mistakes we have made in screwing up the Earth) WORTH it as well.<br />My major problems with \\"Red Mars\\":  the characters can be cardboard/one-dimensional, annoying, stereotypical (i.e. Sax - the brilliant, rational, but passionless, at least on the surface, scientist; Ann - the moody, emotional, also brilliant in her own way, \\"Red Mars\\" purist ; Hiroko - the mysterious Japanese \\"Green Mars\\" cult figure; John Boone - the politician, etc.; Coyote -- the mysterious revoluationary/anarchist), and even laughable at times; the plot can get very confusing, especially with its cast of thousands and its unfamiliar places and names (more and better maps, plus a top-notch appendix, would have been extremely helpful!); things can get repetitive (how many times can we hear the same basic Red/Green argument, for instance, without getting sick of it?), and the writing style can be dry (LOTS of technobabble), humorless, and verrrry slow, and also so predictable at times you can see things coming 50 pages away. <br />Is this great fiction?  Definitely not -- in fact it's pretty bad at times!  Is this a great book?  Well, I wouldn't go THAT far!  Is this a great accomplishment?  Well, yes, most definitely!  If you're at all interested in space exploration, and specifically Mars, I strongly recommend that you read this book.  After reading \\"Red Mars,\\" I'm ready to sign up for the first mission to Mars - when do we leave?	2000-10-15

Why all the acclaim for The Perfect Storm? Good question! Personally, I came into the books with high hopes (due to numerous excellent reviews and what I thought was a potentially interesting story), but came out seriously disappointed. I thought the book had numerous (and serious) problems, including: 1) an almost total lack of character development (the early parts of the book are almost embarrasingly bad!!) by the author, making it very hard to truly care about the fate of the Andrea Gail's crew; 2) lots of technical jargon which is either not defined at all or inadequately defined at best; 3) the author's annoying, self-conscious, and often cringe-inducing attempts to fit in and be accepted by a community to which he will always be an outsider (this is reflected time and again in his writing); 4) the bottom line fact that the Andrea Gail crew was killed because of two main reasons -- greed, the voracious appetite of consumers for fish (which is why the Andrea Gail was out there in the first place!), and surprise, surprise, overfishing (the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;, part 279) -- which has basically decimated an entire ecosystem (and not just of swordfish, either) while putting the lives of human beings needlessly at risk; 5) despite heroic attempts by the author to make this storm (and this tragedy) into something unusual or unique, it's actually not -- there are bad (even really nasty) storms all the time, and lots of people have been lost at sea over the years chasing fish, whales, etc., so why is this particular case so &quot;perfect&quot; (answer:  it's NOT)?; and 6) the Andrea Gail tragedy was not only nothing extrardinary, it was not even particularly deadly -- there have been many other accidents on land, in the air, and at sea which have claimed many more lives than in this &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;.  All in all, &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; can be described as a lot of sound and fury (and waves and wind) signifying...not much!!!<br />So why isthis book so popular? I don't know for sure, but I suspect that there are a lot of bored, frustrated yuppies/lawyers/&quot;IT&quot; professionals in our &quot;techno-economy&quot; looking for some real, physical challenges/adventures.  Also, there are many books, music, television shows, movies, etc. that turn out to be popular, even though their quality level is not particularly high, so go figure!  How does a mediocre or even bad song, movie, or book, end up being more popular than a far better (higher quality/stronger) song, movie, book, or other work or art?  Dumb luck?  Marketing muscle?  Playing to the mass audience's watered-down standards?  <br />Whatever the reason, there are lots of better books about the sea (how about anything by Rachel Carson or Jacques Cousteau?), man's struggle with the elements (see my review of &quot;Bad Land&quot;, or how about &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;The Good Earth,&quot; for instance), etc., than this one, so don't waste your time or money!	2000-10-15

We've got to get out of here.  Engage, I say!<br />Data:  But sir, according to Lawrence Krauss, a distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy from the 20th century, such an action would require energy far greater than is possible in order to manipulate spacetime around the Enterprise sufficiently to travel at \\"warp\\" speed.   Also, for the same reasons, Dr. Krauss essentially ruled out the possibility of a \\"cloaking device\\" and many other things we like to believe are real. <br />Picard:  Data, we don't have TIME for this!  Get us out of here now!!<br />Data:  Captain, I am sorry, but it is simply not possible.  Also, I hate to inform you that, according to Dr. Krauss, our deflector shields will not work either.  But, fortunately, neither will the Romulans' phaser beams. <br />Picard:  What are you saying, Data?!?<br />Data:  What I am saying, sir, is that although we THINK we are aboard a starship called the Enterprise, and although we THINK we just saw 2 Romulan warbirds uncloak, it is all just an illusion.  All of these things would violate several basic laws of physics, including Einstein's general and special theories of relativity, which of course are still valid today.   I am sorry to conclude, sir, that we are just actors on a set at Paramount Studios, that there is no \\"Federation,\\" no \\"Captain Picard,\\" and not even ME!  I would be sad about this if I could be, but my \\"emotion chip\\" (which Dr. Krauss does not discuss in his book, by the way) is not turned on right now.<br />Picard:  Damn!  So my brother was right all along and I should have stayed in France and worked at the family winery!<br />Data:  I am afraid so, sir.  Your brother appears to have been correct.<br />Counselor Troi: I am sensing great frustration and sadness here.  Oh, it's terrible!<br />Data:  What you are experiencing, Counselor, is merely what I believe used to be called a \\"major bummer.\\"   Unfortunately, most of the world that we thought we knew cannot exist, according to \\"The Physics of Star Trek\\", so we will all need to look for new jobs, and our fans will need to look for a new means of entertaining themselves.  It would have been better, of course, if &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot; had been required reading at Star Fleet Academy.  Perhaps then we could have avoided all this confusion.<br />Counselor Troi:  Maybe we could all get together with our fans for reunions and dress up in costumes and just pretend this was all possible...<br />Data:  An excellent idea, Counselor, although I am dubious as to your idea's  practicality.  Maybe if you expanded the idea and called them \\"conventions\\" it might...<br />Worf:  Arrggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Picard:  Are you alright, Mr. Worf?<br />Worf:  I am a Klingon warrior and cannot BELIEVE that a mere PHYSICIST from the 20th century could defeat me!<br />Data:  It is true Worf.

Researching and writing this book obviously was a labor of love for its author, David Pringle, and we (science fiction fans) are all the better for it.  Personally, I have found this book to be highly useful, entertaining, and educational.  For example, I can thank David Pringle for leading me to Olaf Stapledon's \\"Last and First Men\\", one of the most original and amazing books - of any genre - that I have ever read.  Before getting the \\"Ultimate Guide,\\" I am embarrassed to admit that I had never even HEARD of Olaf Stapledon!  Similarly for other authors like M.J. Engh (\\"Arslan\\"), and for books by authors I HAD heard of, like \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" by Philip K. Dick.  Before getting the \\"Ultimate Guide,\\" I basically only new about Dick through \\"Blade Runner.\\"  What's really cool about this guide book is that its author is so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his subject, but is not afraid to give bad reviews, even to famous authors, and good reviews to relative unknowns.  Basically, this guidebook is a meritocracy, in that it doesn't matter how well-known you are; what matters is how good the book is.  That not only speaks highly of David Pringle's integrity, but at the same time makes the book more valuable by increasing the reader's level of trust in Pringle's judgment.  Having now read several of Pringle's recommendations, I now feel like I can trust his judgment, and isn't that the ultimate test of any guide book?	2000-10-13

But does this mean he will be right again?  If you like the human race just the way it is, you better hope that he has totally lost it, because if he's even partly right Homo Sapiens Sapiens is doomed, and in a relatively short time.  On the other hand, if you don't think that humans are the greatest thing since...well...sliced bread or something, then you probably should hope that Kurzweil is right on target with his optimistic vision, because according to him in not too long we're all going to be living forever, but as a new, amazing hybrid species where there is no clear distinction between \\"human\\" and \\"machine\\", and where the universe is opened up to amazing opportunities for exploration and experience.  Fascinating stuff, and Kurzweil presents it in an entertaining way.  <br />In a recent article in \\"Wired\\" magazine, and partly in reaction to Kurzweil, Bill Joy flashed a warning:  extreme danger ahead, proceed only at grave risk.  The danger?  According to Joy, it is largely that what Kurzweil predicts, namely continued rapid technological development in the areas of computing, nanotechnology, and biotech, could easily lead to the extinction of mankind in the not-so-distant future (within a few decades at most).  The difference between Kurzweil and Joy, basically, is that Kurzweil seems excited and even optimistic about the future, whereas Joy seems concerned and even pessimistic.  Who is right?  Does this really come down to a debate between techno-optimists and techno-pessimists?  Between those who want change and those who fear it (like the neo-Luddite \\"Unabomber\\", for instance, who, except for the bombs, appears to be taken quite seriously - or at least his line of reasoning -- by both Kurzweil and Joy).  Or is there some middle ground?  Or are Kurzweil and Joy both totally off base (if not off their rockers)?<br />What is the bottom line here?  Well, in Kurzweil's view we are moving inexorably in a particular direction (namely, towards merger of man and machine).  In \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines,\\" Kurzweil lays out the direction.  Specifically, Kurzweil sees technology continuing to advance rapidly in coming years, and even if his timetable is off by several decades, or even longer, we're still talking about some HUGE changes coming down the road not too far ahead.   Is mankind ready for them, psychologically, ethically, politically, economically?  Good questions, but Kurzweil doesn't really address them, instead just largely assuming that it will all just sort of work out.  That people will embrace the new developments as they come along, and that the computers, as they gain intelligence and, eventually, sentience, will be willing to maintain us poor humans.   Oh sure, there might be a brief flaring of misguided neo-Luddite movements, but they should be minor and not have much impact in the overall scheme of things.<br />Of course, there are plenty of darker visions out there - see Star Trek's \\"Borg\\" collective, the Terminator, The Matrix, Total Recall, etc.  In a way, I hope that Kurzweil is either TOTALLY right or TOTALLY wrong.  I wouldn't want, for instance, his vision of computer/human hybrids with some sort of human underclass being exploited by the superior race.  Or some type of situation where all individuality is lost.  Or one where the machines basically decide that they don't need any extraneous life forms on the planet, and start systematically exterminating them.  In other words, I hope that if Kurzweil is right about the technology part, that he's also right about the OPTIMISM part as well.  Now if he could just convince the Bill Joys out there, I'd feel a lot better...	2000-10-09

During our time off, we were on &quot;Leave Without Pay&quot; from our jobs, which we negotiated with our employers, but were still covered by health insurance.  Mainly, we traveled: around Central and South America, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.  We also took immersion Spanish classes and lived with local families in Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Ecuador, took some time to travel the United States (mainly through Kentucky, Tennessee, and down the Mississippi River to New Orleans).  We rented out our condo, put our stuff in storage, called the IRS to find out what we needed to do as far as taxes were concerned, and found someone (my father) to handle our finances/personal affairs while we were gone.   In all of this, Six Months Off was a great help in planning, as well as in knowing what to expect in terms of expenses and a million other things, including adjusting back into the &quot;real world&quot; when our sabbatical was over!  Budgeting (we didn't go broke) is important, of course, as is health care, insurance, and having a job when you get back (although some decide to just wing it and look for a job after -- or more accurately, IF -- they come back).<br />Basically, we probably could have figured most of what we needed to do on our own, but Six Months Off (and other resources, like friends) were extremely helpful in making things go more smoothly.  Many people dream of taking time off to pursue a dream, but very few actually do it.  Six Months Off shows you how you CAN do it, and leads you through it step by step.  I strongly recommend this book, and I strongly recommend taking Six Months Off if at all possible!  What an amazing experience!	2000-10-02

Since we knew zero (nada!) Spanish, we set off to our local Borders, and luckily found (along with 501 Spanish Verbs), this extremely helpful (and fun) book.  I enjoyed this book so much that before we even left for Guatemala, I had read through probably one-third of it, so I wasn't TOTALLY clueless when I arrived in Antigua.  Fun dialogues of increasing difficulty, pronunciation guides, grammar and usage, vocabulary lists, quizzes, and cultural notes -- they're all here, laid out in a user-friendly way.  If you want to learn Spanish (which is not a bad idea these days, since Spanish is probably the fastest growing language -- of the major spoken languages -- in the world), this is as good a start as any...	2000-10-02

Ray Kurzweil is a genius, and he's been right before (i.e., he barely missed the date of  Deep Blue's victory over Gary Kasparov, predicting it a decade before it happened).  But does this mean he will be right again?  If you like the human race just the way it is, you better hope that he has totally lost it, because if he's even partly right Homo Sapiens Sapiens is doomed, and in a relatively short time.  On the other hand, if you don't think that humans are the greatest thing since...well...sliced bread or something, then you probably should hope that Kurzweil is right on target with his optimistic vision, because according to him in not too long we're all going to be living forever, but as a new, amazing hybrid species where there is no clear distinction between \\"human\\" and \\"machine\\", and where the universe is opened up to amazing opportunities for exploration and experience.  Fascinating stuff, and Kurzweil presents it in an entertaining way.  <br />In a recent article in \\"Wired\\" magazine, and partly in reaction to Kurzweil, Bill Joy flashed a warning:  extreme danger ahead, proceed only at grave risk.  The danger?  According to Joy, it is largely that what Kurzweil predicts, namely continued rapid technological development in the areas of computing, nanotechnology, and biotech, could easily lead to the extinction of mankind in the not-so-distant future (within a few decades at most).  The difference between Kurzweil and Joy, basically, is that Kurzweil seems excited and even optimistic about the future, whereas Joy seems concerned and even pessimistic.  Who is right?  Does this really come down to a debate between techno-optimists and techno-pessimists?  Between those who want change and those who fear it (like the neo-Luddite \\"Unabomber\\", for instance, who, except for the bombs, appears to be taken quite seriously - or at least his line of reasoning -- by both Kurzweil and Joy).  Or is there some middle ground?  Or are Kurzweil and Joy both totally off base (if not off their rockers)?<br />What is the bottom line here?  Well, in Kurzweil's view we are moving inexorably in a particular direction (namely, towards merger of man and machine).  In \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines,\\" Kurzweil lays out the direction.  Specifically, Kurzweil sees technology continuing to advance rapidly in coming years, and even if his timetable is off by several decades, or even longer, we're still talking about some HUGE changes coming down the road not too far ahead.   Is mankind ready for them, psychologically, ethically, politically, economically?  Good questions, but Kurzweil doesn't really address them, instead just largely assuming that it will all just sort of work out.  That people will embrace the new developments as they come along, and that the computers, as they gain intelligence and, eventually, sentience, will be willing to maintain us poor humans.   Oh sure, there might be a brief flaring of misguided neo-Luddite movements, but they should be minor and not have much impact in the overall scheme of things.<br />Of course, there are plenty of darker visions out there - see Star Trek's \\"Borg\\" collective, the Terminator, The Matrix, Total Recall, etc.  In a way, I hope that Kurzweil is either TOTALLY right or TOTALLY wrong.  I wouldn't want, for instance, his vision of computer/human hybrids with some sort of human underclass being exploited by the superior race.  Or some type of situation where all individuality is lost.  Or one where the machines basically decide that they don't need any extraneous life forms on the planet, and start systematically exterminating them.  In other words, I hope that if Kurzweil is right about the technology part, that he's also right about the optimism part.  Now if he could just convince the Bill Joys out there, I'd feel a lot better!	2000-10-01

My wife and I relied primarily on the South American handbook, now in its 77th year (the longest-running travel guide in the English language, apparently) during a 3-month period of backpacking through Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina not too long ago, and along with other information we gleaned from a variety of sources (i.e. fellow backpackers, some maps and other material I had gotten off the internet) it served us extremely well.  However, I can understand why some people might consider the book to be difficult to use in the sense that there's almost too much information and not enough informed opinion/recommendations about what the authors think you SHOULD do.  In many ways, this book is information overload, and not opinionated ENOUGH!  Some of the fun of reading guide books, I have found in my many travels, is listening to someone who has a strong (as long as it is well-informed) opinion, and then seeing for myself what I think.  Also, SOMETIMES it's a relief to be able to turn off my brain for a while and just have someone TELL me what to do if I've got, let's say, just 3 days in a particular city.   <br />But, the bottom line is if you don't mind/prefer to think for yourself, are not particularly into listening to other people's suggested itineraries for you, and are willing to wade through the vast amount of material provided in this guidebook, then you will be richly rewarded with the Handbook, which is truly an amazing creation, and obviously a labor of love!  It sometimes seems, for instance, like the Handbook has a detailed street map on every interesting (and even not-so-interesting) town in South America!  Plus, listings of hotels/hostels and restaurants in numerous price ranges.  Plus, \\"Places of Interest\\", listings of museums, information on excursions, local festivals, archeology, culture, language schools, laundramats, and just about everything else you could possibly need!<br />This book probably should not be the main reference for those wanting to travel first class all the way (or to be led by the hand), but for the budget traveler it's great (Lonely Planet is excellent as well, and would be a fine companion to the Handbook).  Just be prepared to use your brain while wading through a veritable jungle of information on South America!  Don't leave home without the Handbook!!	2000-09-30
US	49404909	R1YY8MXCW7TSSX	0679759069	600988119	Bad Land: An American Romance	Books	5	17	17	N	N	A stark yet romantic vision of America...haunting	Bad Land: An American Romance, by Jonathan Raban, is at once informative and poetic, starkly beautiful and bleak, sympathetic yet harsh, heartbreaking yet enjoyable, historic yet immediately relevant, personal yet broadly relevant, regional yet universal, factual yet romantic (even surrealistic).  In sum, this book is a masterpiece, and richly deserving of its many awards.  If you want to understand the landscape and life of the American west (particularly the Montana/Dakotas area), you should read this book.  In fact, if you want to gain a better understanding not just of the west, but of AMERICA (particularly rural America, but also many of the prevailing myths and values which have permeated or at least influenced ALL of America) itself, you should read this book.<br />Bad Land first and foremost is a book about land.  Specifically, BAD land, in many ways.  Harsh, unforgiving, stark, cold, lonely, dry.  Never enough rain.  Or too much at once.  An at-best marginal (\\"semi-arid\\") land for farming that greedy people (mainly the railroads) used to lure naïve (or desperate, or bored, or restless, or ambitious, or crazy, or idealistic) immigrants to with printed glossy brochures, distributed all over the United States and Europe, translated into German, Russian, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish,etc., and filled with romantic pictures of \\"free, rich farmland\\" with such \\"attractive details, that readers would commit their families and their life savings, sight unseen.\\"  And come they did, by the thousands, homesteaders (\\"honyockers\\") lured also by the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 (passed \\"after a great deal of lobbying by the railroad companies\\"), out to make their fortune in what was touted as practically a land flowing with milk and honey.  Of course, since this was patently not true, the vast majority of \\"honyockers\\" failed, and Raban is a master of describing people's romantic dreams, efforts, and - for most -their ultimate, heartbreaking failure.<br />But evenmore than a history, this book is a meditation on humans and their attempt to subdue (or at least coexist with) an uncaring, unforgiving, fickle nature.  In a way, this book isn't even really about the American west per se; rather, it is about man - sometimes noble, sometimes greedy, sometimes clever, sometimes stupid, sometimes a loner or misfit, etc.  And it is about hopes, dreams, individual lives, ghost towns, ghosts, aesthetics (largely of the vast prairie landscape, dirt, shadows, sunsets, and barbed-wire fences), fantasy, reality, myth-making, faith (blind and otherwise), technology, water, soil, and weather (among many other things).  Incredible that Jonathan Raban is able to capture so much in one 358-page book; this was obviously a labor of love, one that Raban immersed himself in, and which you will find yourself immersed in as well!	2000-09-30

I agree with many of the comments by other reviewers here.  This definitely is not just another &quot;self-help&quot; book.  It certainly could be very useful to you whether or not you're not a Buddhist. There are numerous important lessons here (especially about being compassionate with yourself and others), and in general the book is filled with wisdom and deep psychological understanding. Finally, the book probably can be best appreciated if read slowly, and more than once as well.  Many of the lessons contained within are not simple, and also counter to much of prevailing American/Western culture (&quot;feel good&quot;, &quot;quick-fix&quot;, naive sunny optimism, owning more/bigger/better stuff makes you happy, the cult of youth, mindless sex and violence, etc.).  <br />Chodron's solutions to life's problems are not easy ones, necessarily, and certainly not ones that you can purchase for any amount of money, but they are rich and deep and true, and so refreshing.	2000-09-28

According to Tom Friedman's \\"Lexus and the Olive Tree\\", globalization is not only inevitable, but it's a wondrous and many splendored thing to be embraced and celebrated.  Oh, and by the way, if you don't embrace and celebrate globalization, you'll be left in the dust bin of history along with all the other losers and be forever stuck with a bunch of stupid olive trees instead of a nice shiny [begin using Homer Simpson voice here] Lexus (d'oh! ).  Lexus...McDonalds....Shopping Malls...Beer....aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  [ok, you can stop using the Homer Simpson voice now!].<br />Basically, this is a good book if you want to understand globalization.  But it's a bad book if you want to understand why globalization might not be an unmitigated great thing.  Because, according to Friedman, globalization is [Tony the Tiger voice here] totally grrrrrreat!   And who needs all those stupid old olive trees (i.e., your culture, traditions, values, language, music, art, family, religion) anyway when you can eat at a McDonalds (conveniently located in your local mall), people speaking English (not their antiquated and useless native tongues, for heaven's sake), work for a friendly (and of course benign, because if it weren't it would immediately get trashed all over the internet and would be forced to change - have faith!) multinational corporation, listen to American popular music, watch American TV and movies, dress like an American, adopt the same capitalist economic values as Americans (the only ones that have any chance of working anyway!), and basically, just BE an American!   Hey, it's inevitable anyway, and resistance is futile, so you might as well lay back and enjoy it!<br />But, the problem is - and this is sacrilege and stupidity to Friedman -- what if you don't WANT to be an American?  What if you'd rather take a siesta in the afternoon, or drink wine and nibble cheese at the local family-owned café you've been going to for years, or actually meet your friends PHYSICALLY (as opposed to virtually over the - bow down as you say this word -- INTERNET), or prefer to have less manufactured stuff (and hence, slower economic \\"growth\\") and more olive trees?  Well, sorry buddy, but you better just [you can use a drill sergeant voice here if you want] GET WITH THE PROGRAM!  and fast, or you're going to be left behind everyone else smart enough to put on their golden straitjackets! <br />Anyway, if you want to understand globalization (which you should if you want to understand the world you live in and where it is going), this book is as good a place as any to start, I suppose (if you can get past all the annoying anecdotes, bad jokes, and cloying banalities which Friedman crams in - probably in an effort to be entertaining and not too heavy and seem really witty and urbane and sell LOTS OF BOOKS!).  But, if you want to really think about what this book SHOULD have been about - what do we want out of life, more olive trees or more Lexuses? - then you'll have to go elsewhere.  In Friedman's world, the olive trees don't stand a chance!	2000-09-25

Unlike most of the \\"history\\" we were force-fed in school, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is at once thought-provoking, well-written, fascinating, and highly entertaining.  Jared Diamond richly deserves all the accolades (and money), which he has earned!  Hey, anyone who can make history interesting to millions of Americans raised on a thin gruel of rote memorization, boring textbooks, and self-serving propaganda (see James Loewen's \\"Lies My Teacher Told Me\\") has got to be doing something right!<br />As far as the critics of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" at least as indicated by reviews here at Amazon.com, they basically seem to be arguing that the book is flawed because it is (choose one or more): \\"politically correct,\\" \\"left-wing,\\" not \\"original,\\" \\"lacking in concrete evidence,\\" overly deterministic in its focus on natural forces/factors, and -- a related criticism - neglectful of important \\"human variables,\\" particularly \\"culture\\" and \\"religion.\\"  <br />OK, then, what about it, is the book \\"politically correct\\" or \\"left-wing\\"?  Well, if by \\"politically correct\\" the critics are referring to a hypersensitivity to any criticism of the \\"in\\" group(s) of the day, and/or holding the majority (or an \\"out\\" group, like white males, in some people's view) to a far tougher standard than others are held to, I don't really see how that criticism applies to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".  Reason?  Diamond is not saying that Europeans are BAD because they conquered the Indians or Africans or whoever, he's just explaining WHY Europeans conquered the Indians or Africans or whoever.  Huge difference there!   Really, it's surprising that this book is criticized as \\"PC\\", because as far as I can tell it's basically arguing \\"survival of the fittest\\" on a racial level (although not for any \\"inherent\\" or \\"God-given\\" reason, but basically for totally natural/arbitrary/accidental factors), and I thought that \\"survival of the fittest\\" was an old favorite of many conservatives, even fascists.  So, in sum, I just don't understand why this criticism is being made at all.<br />As far as \\"lacking in concrete evidence,\\" I think that's kind of a silly criticism for a book which is written specifically for a mass audience, plus it's wrong anyway.  Diamond presents PLENTY of fascinating, thought-provoking, entertaining evidence for his thesis, and if you want more you can read lots more about it all over the place!  <br />As far as \\"ignoring human variables\\" (especially \\"culture\\" and \\"religion\\"), that gets to the heart of Diamond's whole argument, and people who make this criticism either don't get Diamond's argument or just don't LIKE it (probably because it implies that THEIR \\"culture\\" and/or \\"religion\\" are not inherently any more wonderful or superior to any others, although they certainly may be more adaptive in a Darwinian \\"survival of the fittest\\" sense).  <br />The thing is, this whole question is a \\"chicken and egg\\" paradox.  In other words, is northern European Protestantism (for instance) more powerful than, let's say, Native American religions, because it is inherently \\"better\\" in some sense, or is it more that northern European Protestantism HAPPENED to win out (for all kinds of reasons not under their control, like germs, which they didn't even know about), and as the victors they got to write history (and, not surprisingly, portray themselves in the most positive light).  Just to take one powerfully intriguing example, what if Europeans had come over to America and been decimated by native American diseases instead of the other way around?  That ALONE probably would have stopped the Europeans from defeating the Indians.  Imagine if a few survivors had sailed back to Europe carrying these diseases and Europe had largely been wiped out as well.  Among many other things, I don't think too many people would be making the argument today that European civilization was superior to any other, that's for sure!<br />Anyway, the bottom line here is that this is a great book.So, pay no heed to the ideologues and nitpickers, read the book for yourself, and enjoy a fantastic story!	2000-09-25

This book, which (ironically?) should be required reading in U.S. schools, asks - and answers - some important questions.  For instance, \\"why is history taught like this\\"?  why is history such an unpopular subject?,  and \\"what is the result of teaching history like this\\"?  James Loewen, a professor at the University of Vermont, spent 11 years researching and writing a book which attempts to answer these and other questions.  And although Loewen certainly has a specific political perspective (left-of-center), it really doesn't matter much as far as the book is concerned.  Someone with a right-of-center political ideology theoretically could have written a book like this, because the bottom line is that the way American history is \\"taught\\" now shortchanges EVERYONE - right/left, white/black, man/woman, majority/minority, etc.<br />Lowen's overall conclusion regarding the teaching of American history in our schools is that \\"something has gone very wrong.\\"  The biggest problems, in his opinion:  \\"the books are boring...every problem has already been solved or is about to be\\", textbooks \\"exclude conflict or real suspense\\", textbooks \\"almost never use the present to illuminate the past\\", they \\"keep students in the dark about the nature of history\\" (which is not always sweetness and light, even in America, believe it or not!), and they always try to paint America - especially white, male, European, upper class, Christian America -- in the best possible light, even when it contradicts the facts.  But no matter what your ethnicity or political point of view, you should be opposed to the way history is taught in schools, because it makes a mockery of American history (and ultimately America itself), which is a fascinating history (and country) - in all its incarnations (good, bad, amoral, etc.).  Taught in a moronic, boring, rote-memorizing way, however, American history is sure to turn off just about anyone with a brain.  And that's pretty pitiful when you consider the amazing dramas that American history contains - it takes some real effort to make THAT boring!   But U.S. history textbooks manage it, somehow...  <br />The result of all this?  Unlike just about any other subject, studying history the way it is taught in our schools \\"actually makes students stupid,\\" according to Lowen, and they get stupider the more they study it!  Students (and future voters) are thus \\"hamstrung in their efforts to analyze controversial issues in our society.\\"  Besides making people stupid and bored, the way history is taught in America today also leads to all kinds of distorted views (to the extent that students pay any attention) of the past, and ultimately the present (and even the future).  This problem is especially bad for non-European minority students, especially if their group happened to be one of the \\"losers\\" historically.  For those students, \\"American\\" history is hardly about them or their ancestors at all, which of course implies that their history/ancestors/culture are not worth writing about. (Sort of like when I was a kid and thought that all the news was in the newspaper; if it wasn't in the newspaper it must not be important!).   To the extent that Native American history is covered at all, for instance, it almost totally glosses over some pertinent facts, like for starters that Christopher Colombus and the majority of European \\"explorers\\" consciously set out to enslave, convert, oppress, torture, and even exterminate the natives, mainly in the name of profit maximization.  This is not an issue of being \\"PC\\", or \\"psychotherapy for minorities\\" as the Rush Limbaugh \\"dittoheads\\" would undoubtedly argue, but of depicting history, warts and all, ACCURATELY.  As it is now, American history can be thought of as little more than \\"psychotherapy for whites\\".  Do we really need THAT?  Are we saying that European Americans can't handle the truth?  Remember, there's both glory and ignomy in everyone's history.  We're all human, after all.  Maybethat's what bothers the right wingers most of all - the thought that they and their ancestors are in the same boat as everyone else, and that they are not inherently special or better than anyone else.  But isn't that what America's supposed to be about?  Equality of opportunity?  All men are CREATED EQUAL?<br />Anyway, the bottom line question here is: what constitutes American patriotism?  If you think it should be a blind, unthinking belief in America's goodness and greatness, then don't read this book...it will just make you angry!  If you think, though, that what makes America a great country is diversity (of thought, mainly), the liberty to draw your own conclusions and hold whatever beliefs you care to hold, and the right to argue whatever side you're on passionately in a great democracy, then this is the book for you.  Enjoy!	2000-09-25

I agree with many of the comments made in the other readers' reviews of  &quot;Kindred,&quot; and overall I would strongly recommend this book.  If  nothing else, &quot;Kindred&quot; gives you a better feel for slavery, and  more of an understanding of what African-Americans have gone through in  this country.<br />HOWEVER... I believe that there is a glaring ethical  problem in &quot;Kindred&quot; which seriously weakens the book as a work  of fictional literature.  I realized the magnitude of this ethical problem  largely thanks to a conversation with an African-American colleague of mine  (I'm a white male), who is a great admirer of Octavia Butler's writing and  who I accompanied to a speech and booksigning by Ms. Butler held at the  Smithsonian in Washington, DC.  To state the ethical problem as succinctly  and clearly as I can: How can Dana make the decision to keep a complex, but  ultimately disgusting, repulsive human being like Rufus alive solely in  order to ensure that she (Dana) will eventually be born, when that dooms  another human being (Alice) to a horrible life (and eventual suicide) as  Rufus' sex slave?  <br />To me, and to my African-American colleague, the  obvious (albeit extremely difficult and courageous) ethical choice would  for Dana to let Rufus die, even if it meant sacrificing her own future  existence, in an attempt to prevent another human being's (in this case  Alice's) terrible suffering.  By this reasoning, the fact that Dana allows  Rufus to live and hence Alice to suffer so horribly in order that Dana  might be born years later, is both a horribly selfish and ultimately a  totally unethical decision.  <br />But the problem with &quot;Kindred&quot; is  not Dana's decisions (or lack thereof) per se but Octavia Butler's decision  as the creator of &quot;Kindred&quot; not to have Dana at least agonize  over this major ethical dilemma.  Let me be clear: Octavia Butler's  decision ultimately to have Dana act as she does in the novel isnot  necessarily wrong from a literary perspective.  The problem is that Ms.  Butler should have used Dana's choices to open up an important and  potentially fascinating ethical discussion (selfishness vs. selflessness,  is there anything worth dying for?, are there some conditions under which  it is not worth living?, etc.).  As it is, unfortunately, Dana shows close  to zero self-awareness of the ethical choices she is making (or failing to  make).  Sure, Alice might still have ended up in a terrible situation or  dead no matter what Dana had or hadn't done, but isn't this worthy at least  of a discussion (or at the minimum an internal debate in Dana's head) in  the book?  <br />Despite this glaring problem, &quot;Kindred&quot; is an  excellent and important book; at a minimum for its ability to make  contemporary readers FEEL slavery (as opposed to reading about it in a  textbook), and also for its demonstration of how easily it would be for  many of us, if put in such a situation, to find ourselves following the  path of least resistance (&quot;there but for the grace of God go I&quot;)  and either becoming a slaveowner or at a minimum accepting (and not  resisting) slavery (or whatever other evil.  All in all,  &quot;Kindred&quot; is an excellent book, but it could have been much more.   Still, I enjoyed it a lot, frustrations notwithstanding, and believe it  should be read as widely as possible (and definitely NOT just by black  female science fiction fans!) as a means of bringing a critical part of  American (and human) history to life.	2000-09-13

OK, first let's get one thing out of the way - this is a great book, and  it's absolutely irrelevant if you label it \\"science fiction,\\" \\"alternative  history,\\" or whatever.  Except for the purposes of book marketing, who  cares anyway?  The bottom line is that Philip K. Dick was too complex and  intelligent a man for his work to be pinned down into any one genre.  And  who would want it to be?!?   On one level, or course, \\"The Man in the High  Castle\\" is - at least on the surface and on the jacket cover - about an  alternative time line in which America loses World War II (with the Nazis  taking over East of the Mississippi, the Japanese West of the Rockies, and  the middle being a kind of backwater/no-man's land).  But what is this book  really about?  My conclusion after reading the book, as well as many of the  reviews here and out there on the web, as well as some stuff about Philip  K. Dick, as well as talking to a really smart friend of mine who has read  the book many times, is that this book is about several main themes, and  can be read on several different levels (as most great works of fiction can  be). <br />Thus, in my opinion \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" is about, among  other things (in no particular order): 1) the lives of Americans under  Japanese occupation; 2) the lives of the Japanese occupiers, and especially  their interaction with various Americans - white, black, Jewish; 3) the  Japanese-German relationship, and the difference in Japanese and German  culture; 4) what is the nature of \\"reality\\"?; 5) what is \\"authentic\\" and  what is \\"fake\\"?; 6) what constitutes a moral life?; 7) culture and national  identity; 8) how does one remain true to one's self/ideals, especially when  it isn't easy to do so; 9) what is sane and what is crazy, especially in a  highly confusing world without clear black-and-white moral choices (in  other words, OUR world!)?; 10) the concept that there is some fascist  within all of us, and how easy it is for fascism to settle in comfortably  to \\"middle America\\"; 11) the place of the artist, artistic freedom, and  artistic courage; 12) the connection between art and the \\"real world\\"; and  13) a relatively deterministic (i.e., Hegelian, the I Ching) view of the  way history works (in which humans are essentially pawns) vs. one in which  things are NOT preordained and in which actions (or lack thereof) by  individuals can play huge roles.  Whew!  That's more to think about in one  book than you'll get in several books of popular fiction put  together!<br />The bottom line:  Philip K. Dick is a genius, and this is  possibly his greatest book (although another one of his books is better  known because it was made into the movie \\"Blade Runner\\").  Read it now...you  won't soon forget it!  (PS  The complaints about the ending not tying  things up neatly totally miss the point of the book - see #4, #5, #8, #11,  and #12 above!).	2000-09-05

Numerous interesting anecdotes  as well as colorful people illustrate his main thematic points (the \\"Law of  the Few\\", the \\"Stickiness Factor\\", the \\"Power of Context\\") as well as his  three main types of people who help to \\"tip\\"things (\\"Connectors\\", \\"Mavens\\",  and \\"Salesmen.\\").  The \\"Tipping Point\\" may not be totally original, as it  borrows heavily from other social scientists (e.g., Philip Zimbardo's and  his famous Prison Experiment; Judith Harris' excellent book -- \\"The Nurture  Assumption\\" -- on the importance of  \\"environment,\\"especially peers, vs  \\"heredity\\" or parents) as well as precursors and relatives to the concept  (e.g. the \\"Broken Window\\" theory of crime, \\"Six Degrees of Separation,\\" the  importance of \\"Weak Ties\\").   The particular value of Gladwell's book,  however, is in drawing much of this together in a way that is at once  understandable and fun to read without \\"dumbing down\\" his main idea, which  is that although the world may appear to be fixed and unchangeable, it can  in fact be \\"tipped\\" much easier than we think, if we can just identify  where to apply leverage.  <br />This conclusion has potentially enormous  implications for commerce, politics, health, education, and many other  areas.  For instance, if you believe that crime in the United States has  \\"tipped\\" downwards due to application of a \\"broken windows\\" concept of law  enforcement, this implies that both conservatives (with their heavy  emphasis on \\"get tough on crime\\" policies) and liberals (with their  emphasis on attacking the root social, economic, and cultural causes of  crime) may both be basically wasting time and resources.  Instead, Gladwell  suggests, why don't we focus on things we can change quickly, at minimal  cost, which could end up starting an \\"epidemic\\" and thereby achieve the  intended goal at a far smaller price than otherwise?   Gladwell citesonly  a few (but generally well-chosen) examples, such as Paul Revere's \\"midnight  ride\\" (I bet most of us don't remember William Dawes, the other person who  also made a midnight ride that same night - for good reason, as Gladwell  illustrates) and the war on smoking, which has tried (and largely failed)  to convince/coerce people not to smoke.  Gladwell asks, why not shift the  strategy to reducing the \\"stickiness\\" of cigarettes (by, for instance,  regulating the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to a level which would not  be addictive).  Or, alternatively, how about using anti-depressant drugs  like Zyban, which work on smoking as well?  In sum, the \\"Tipping Point\\"  concept could be extremely useful on this and on many other issues which  take up so much time and energy in our public life in America.  Gladwell's  book should be a breath of fresh air to anyone tired of stale rhetoric,  political gridlock in Washington, or frustration with seemingly intractable  problems which, in Gladwell's view, CAN actually be solved.	2000-09-04

Judith Harris' courageous book challenges the overwhelming orthodoxy in America, that families are the \\"be all and the end all,\\" and that parents  are of utmost importance in raising children (or as homophobic right  wingers like to say, the best people to raise a child are \\"one daddy and  one mommy\\" as opposed to, for instance, two daddies or two mommies or one  daddy or one mommy, etc.).  Harris' book is, therefore, a breath of fresh  air in the tired, stale atmosphere surrounding all things related to  families and children.  What if, Harris asks, around half of how children  turns out is genetics, and of the other half, most of that is related to  the child's TOTAL environment (including neighborhood, schools, peers,  siblings, and - somewhere in there, but trailing far behind - parents).   <br />Besides threatening to put psychoanalysts everywhere out of business  (\\"you mean it WASN'T my parents; fault after all?   So why am I paying  $100 an hour to lay on your couch and talk about my controlling mother and  absent father?  I'm outta here! \\"), Harris's book throws at least one  small monkey wrench in the seemingly unstoppable (and truly tiresome)  pro-family rhetoric spewing from the mouths of every politician in America.   If Harris is right, then basically the conservatives are wrong (parents,  unless they are truly horrible or truly amazing -- are of questionable  importance at best in the rearing of children, according to Harris) and  Hillary Clinton is right (it DOES take a village...and in fact it is the  village that is of utmost importance in how children turn out, NOT the  parents).  In addition (and again unlike many \\"pro-family\\" types) Harris  provides actual research and data (what a concept!) to back up her claims.   But, unfortunately, Harris is fighting a strongly entrenched viewpoint,  with lots of vested interests (how many parents are going to admit that  they really don't matter much in their children's upbringing?  And how many  politiciansare going to say, \\"you know, it's not really the family, it's  the society, stupid!\\"?)  Well, maybe not many, but Harris' book is a start  at least towards getting at least some [openminded] people to think  differently.  Whether she succeeds in starting a revolution in this area is  doubtful, but still, it's refreshing that SOMEONE out there has had the  courage to state a view outside the mainstream on such an emotional issue.   Thank you Judith Harris!	2000-09-04

Chapter 10, for instance, provides an excellent, original  look at world oil supply disruptions since 1973.  Other chapters, however,  ramble on or are badly written and could have used some major editing.  In  the end, this book, although filled with a lot of good information, is not  as useful as it could have been if 1) it had been better organized/edited;  and 2) some of the weaker chapters had been eliminated or replaced with  better ones on their subjects.  Finally, a major problem with this book --  its uneven style, content, and quality -- may have been partly avoidable if  the editor had been a bit more ruthless or at least settled on a few themes  or approaches by his 25 &quot;experts in the field&quot;.  On the other  hand, it may just be that there is some value in a book which makes clear  the lack of consensus among world oil market analysts.  Perhaps the  &quot;New Global Oil Market&quot;'s goal of creating a comprehensive,  succint, and authoritative book on world oil markets may, despite its best  efforts, was simply unreachable.	2000-08-03

Like all of Stephen Ambrose's books, \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is very well written, extensively researched, fascinating, and entertaining.  I strongly recommend this book, as well as other Ambrose books like \\"Citizen Soldiers.\\"  Having said all that, and even though I  think \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is overall an excellent (4 stars) book,  I have several problems with it. First, as Ambrose himself laments several  times, there are large gaps in Lewis' journals (for unkown reasons,  although possibly related to spells of serious depression?), which means  that some of the most interesting parts of the Lewis and Clark expedition  are essentially blank voids or at best second-hand or lesser accounts.  This is a tremendous loss to history, and possibly irretrievable.  Highly  unfortunate -- and a major bummer!  Second, although Lewis was excellent  at recording important details of flora, fauna, latitude and longitude, he  is absolutely clueless (or uninterested) -- as Ambrose also admits/laments  -- about human emotions, especially his own.  Although Ambrose tries to  fill in the gaps, Lewis' lack of psychological/emotional awareness severely  harms his narrative (the most glaring is Lewis' rapid deterioration from  heroic expedition leader to alcoholic, drug addict, and ultimate suicide.  Unfortunately, we really have no clue why this was the case.) Meanwhile,  Lewis makes matters even worse by combining his emotional/psychological  myopia with a nearly unremitting, condescending, patronizing attitude  towards blacks, women, and Indians.  Admittedly, this was in character with  aristocratic, slave-owning, Southern white males of his day, but still, I  personally find it to be a constant annoyance, at the least.  Also, Lewis'  actions at various points were extremely reckless, and potentially  disastrous, based largely on his view of the Indians as children/simpletons  who could be manipulated at will.  Great commander and leader? Questionable  at best! Finally, although Lewis and Clark's expedition certainly was an  amazing one, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disguist and sadness at  both the behavior of Lewis and his men (I understand the danger of applying  today's moral standards to history, but still!). Basically, what we're  witnessing here, when you remove all the romanticism and adventure, is an  esentially cold-blooded, realpolitik stab by young America at empire  building, which in the end would lead to brutal destruction and near-total  devastation (of Native Americans and the buffalo, for starters), and  ultimately the creation of a country where even all WHITE MEN (let alone  non-whites and women)were (are?) not equal.  What we're also witnessing if  we look below the surface romanticism of the whole expedition (and also the  knowledge gained, which is impressive and important) is a bunch of young  American men cutting an amoral, not-particularly-attractive swath through  Louisiana territory, across the Rockies, to the Pacific and back, leaving a  trail of destruction, deception, and disease in their wake.and Clark's expedition certainly was an  amazing one, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disguist and sadness at  both the behavior of Lewis and his men (I understand the danger of applying  today's moral standards to history, but still!).

The &quot;Book of Revelation&quot; is an appropriate title for this haunting, strange, disturbing, darkly funny novel.  What is revealed here?  In a way, not much, including details about most of the characters, or,  even, an answer to the identity or motives of the kidnappers.  In another  way, however, a lot is revealed, or at least explored, in this novel,  including issues of sexuality, power, memory, and even, in an Existential  philosophy sense, the search for meaning in an absurd, chaotic world.   Hints of Kafka (the Trial), Camus (the Stranger), Bowles (The Sheltering  Sky) and even Anne Rice (her vampire books, for instance, explore many of  the same themes).  A fascinating, engrossing book, and one you will not  soon forget.	2000-06-15

As someone who has studied the Middle East extensively, I found this book to be well-written, but ultimately -- and unfortunately -- just a rehash of secondary sources. In other words, although there's nothing particularly  wrong with this book, there's nothing particularly great about it either.   No inside insights into what made the enigmatic King Hussein tick, for  instance, which could have been very helpful and interesting but which  would have required the author to interview people who knew the King well.  It also would have been interesting if the author could have untangled the  many seeming contradictions in King Hussein's reign, but unfortunately he  either tried but was unable to do so or just did not do the necessary  legwork needed to discover some of these answers. Ultimately, it appears  that the author, or perhaps his publisher, was more interested in rushing  out the &quot;first book on King Hussein since his death&quot; than in  doing a first-rate job.  That's unfortunate, and ultimately a disservice to  this fascinating man and also to the events he lived through and played a  role in.	2000-06-07

This book was surprisingly good, funny, well-written, and even moving (I refer in particular to Shatner's emotional encounter with a woman suffering from multiple personalities -- including Spock and Kirk -- due to horrible  abuse by her father).  Among other things, I never realized that William  Shatner had such an excellent sense of self-deprecating humor, but he  certainly does and he puts it to good use in his explorations of the  American subculture of Star Trek conventions. Besides humor, Shatner also  displays a significant amount of psychological perceptivity and  sensititivity (I know, it's hard to believe based on the swaggering Capt.  Kirk character as well as on the numerous less-than-flattering accounts by  former colleagues of Shatner's, many of which depict him as an arrogant,  strutting jerk).  Finally, Shatner provides keen insights into fame, fans,  and the connection between fantasy and reality.  I definitely recommend  this book, and not just for Star Trek fans.	2000-06-07
