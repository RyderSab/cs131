I have cried, and laughed at the things he said in his books. I don't mean that I laughed at his books,but at the things he said , the way he said  them. I also was with the LRRP/RANGERS (echo 50th /75th), and I know a  little bit about what he was writting about. I have met Gary &amp; I know  that he is a truthful,&amp; honorable man. So thats what make me say that  all his books are the true meaning of the men he writes about. Roadrunner6  out	2000-01-16

I have really enjoyed reading his  works. I would recommend that anyone who hasn't read all his books, and the  other two books of this series seach the book stores for them, or if they  are reading this order them from Amazon.com. Thats the easiest way to get  them. Thanks Gary. Roadrunner 6 out.	2000-01-07

Once again I am stumped at how someone could truely read this book, and find it Weak.  I think Larry did an outstanding job in writting this book, my only belief is that the person that found this book weak was never  in the NAM, or else he was a rear echelon person. I am not knocking him if  he was,cause if it hadn't been for these guys, We RANGERS,could not have  done our jobs as we did. Larry thank you for writting this book to let the  people know what we really went through in VIET-NAM. Roadrunner 6 out	2000-01-07

I don't know if Michael had a personnal expierence with the LRRP/RANGERS, but he still did an excellent job of  depicting the things that many of our young RANGER boys went through.

I have read all three of them  three times, and have enjoyed them just as much each time I read them. I  think Rey did an outstanding job of telling how the LRRP companies started.  I have never met Rey,  I am hoping to get an invite to their next reunion.  I am an EX/ LRRP/RANGER. I was with ECHO/ 50th LRRPs then We became ECHO  75th RANGER. Roadrunner 6 out	2000-01-07

All  though I am not a   (queer) there were time when I would have kissed the  pilot on the lips for getting our guys out of Trouble. W.T. I think you  guys did more then was expected of you.

Limey is an acquaintance of mine, and what you read in the book, is just the kind of man he is. He is a man who fought for  our country, when he  really didn't have to. His book is an expert look at the War in The Nam.        Rangers Leads The Way	1999-12-21
