And this author doesn't get into a lot of romance either. But even though I pretty much could read between the lines early on about the romance part because, well, let's face, any time a good looking FBI \\"hunk\\" is staying with a beautiful woman, we all know what to expect. That's life in the writing world, or so I think. But the story flowed well and kept you wondering when the killer was going to strike next and if he was going to find Mara. This is my first novel to read for this writer. My buddy at the book store put me on to this author, telling me I had to read the trilogy on this one. So I've just finished DEAD WRONG and now I'm getting ready to read DEAD CERTAIN. I love a good mystery read where I have to figure out who the bad guy is. In Dead Wrong, we already know who the bad guy is, and that makes this book a little different. Instead of trying to figure out \\"who\\", you're trying to figure out \\"what\\" he's going to do next. The plot was good, the characters were strong and the story flowed very well. Spike, the dog, even added to it. I recommend this one and I'm looking forward to the next two, Dead Certain and Dead Even. Mariah Stewart has a lot of talent. I'll be watching for her next published novels.	2005-09-18

She isn't so lucky in love and she's beginning to wonder if she ever will be. But the ins and outs of her every day life as written in the first person, are filled with humor, delightful scenarios, and a taste of melancholy where her parents are concerned. I don't know when I've enjoyed such a light-hearted read so much, and was so pleased with the ending. Dolores J. Wilson must have a heart of gold and it shows in her writing.

The story kept a great steady pace of flowing well. The characters were good with a great plot. Since I've been reading a lot of Sandra Brown lately, I suppose I've gotten good at figuring out who the bad guys are, because I guessed this one from the beginning. However, there were a lot of ins and outs and different twists to this story that would keep a person guessing. I bought the book and I'm glad I did, because it's a keeper. I do recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a great suspense story.	2005-09-05
US	52746777	R39GKHSPGSMXG7	0743246446	347904247	Looking for Peyton Place: A Novel	Books	3	11	14	N	N	Sort of far-fetched, but good writing	This book by B. Delinksy is a first for me. I picked it up and thought it sounded interesting, especially since I'm a big fan of the original Peyton Place and I admired the writing so much of Grace Metalious. If a book doesn't grab me right off, then I tend to wander off onto something else. Then I'll go back and read a little more. When, or if, a slow-starting NOW YOU GOT ME book such as this one, finally gets my interest. Then I stay with it. The first 100 pages were lacking, but then the story picked up and I finished reading the book. I'll have to say that I think Delinksy is a wonderful writer. But this book just didn't seem to fit with the plot and the characters. Since I have nothing else to compare it with that I've read before of Delinsky's work, then I can only muster a three-star rating. I already own the book, so it will go into my library. But just to be on the safe side, I'll go to my local library for my next Delinksy read. I think her heart was in the right place, but maybe just at the wrong time. Her research was good and that's a plus in her favor. And her romance section was clean and neat, another plus. If you're looking for trashy romance scenes, this book isn't for you. But if you're looking for romance that's truly sincere and sweet, then it is. I'll read more of Delinksy's work again, no doubt about that.	2005-08-31

But I'm glad now that I read it. It's a story of two youngsters forming a deep friendship. The girl, Leslie is strong and had a vivid imagination as most young girls generally do. And Jess knew he wasn't nearly as brave as Leslie, more like the odd boy out. It's rough on a young lad to know a girl can outrun him. Imagine being beaten by a girl. But he managed to overcome the fact that she was faster, that she wasn't afraid, and that she'd done so much more in her young years than he. Two small children meet and strike up an unforgettable friendship. The story is tragic, very sad in parts, but after you've finished reading it, there's a smile on your face. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages.	2005-07-23

Barack Obama is just sprouting his wings as a U.S. Senator from Illinois. And with this guy's talent for writing and speaking, as far as I'm concerned, he's probably the shiniest up-and-coming bright star for the Democrat party yet. But Obama need not worry if he chooses to walk away from a political career anytime in the near future, because he's a lawyer. The guy is sharp as a razor, and probably one of the best writers of non-fiction that I've had the pleasure to read, if not the best. Obama took a true story and wrote like it was fiction. Now that takes talent in my book. So if nothing else, he could set his mind to just writing books and make a pretty good living. If he remains on the political scene for very long, no doubt he'll have some great writing material. Unfortunately, I missed Obama's keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. Too bad, too, because after reading his speech at the end of this book, I'd have enjoyed hearing every word of it, I'm sure. The guy is a gifted speaker, has a way with words that's his very own style, and appears to care deeply for his people. Let's hope, as he's said and written, that his deep concern for helping others can, and will, extend to all races...as it should. <br />The reviews that have already been written about Obama's book pretty well explain its content, except for the negative reviews which were only a few. And after reading some of those negative reviews, makes one think they were written by some neo-cons that view Obama as a threat to the present reigning political party. And with good cause, because Obama will go as far as his heart desires no matter what his future endeavors might be. <br />I'm for Barack Obama whether he's writing a book, practicing law, or running for President of the United States.  <br />	2005-06-05

So...what else is new? Or that's what one would ask that's probably already been there and done that. Apparently Fitzgerald isn't the first ex-employee to expose this major governmental problem.  Still, I suppose what amazed me, or even amused me, is that Fitzgerald had enough guts to name a certain popular and politically powerful California Senator in her book.  And she wasn't talking favorably either. I'm still shaking my head on that one. Fortunately, this Federal Agent, like so many others, had the sense to get out while the getting was still good and she was still breathing. Some weren't so lucky according to Fitzgerald. <br />Overall, this is a good story, and no doubt Fitzgerald was a qualified and capable employee, both highly needed attributes for the position she held. Unfortunately, there aren't many like her that will stand up and tell the truth.   Surely a time will come when there will be enough like Fitzgerald to tell their story and someone that can do something about it...can...and will.  Sooner or later, a change will have to come about. <br />My problem with this book itself is that it was so poorly written.  Poor grammar was indeed a factor, but even worse was the dialogue bunched up in the same paragraphs all the time, making the reader wonder who was talking most of the time and who wasn't.  Also, the pictures didn't impress me all that much either. <br />Had this book been properly written in book format, and edited for errors, it could have been a real winner.  Too bad, because it really is a great story.  Regardless, I still have to recommend this book to non-fiction lovers.  The information Fitzgerald comes forth with about the apparent corruption and collusion that's running amok in the U.S. Customs Service is worthreading.  Makes the reader wonder if anything has changed since Fitzgerald wrote this book in 2002.   <br />	2005-05-17

I purchased the book new but wish now I'd waited and picked it up at the library. I was hoping to read something close to the \\"The Firm\\" or one of his better books. But this one left me sadly disappointed. I think he got a little carried away with speaking Italian to the point that at times I thought it was almost boring. And if there's anything I hate, it's paying for a book that can bore me. Something in me wants to think he had the right idea for a really good plot, but just didn't know how to carry it through to make the story exciting...a real page turner. I'm sure Grisham put lot of effort into this, so I can only wish him better luck next time.	2005-03-19

And I couldn't wait to get started on this book. However, I would have to admit that I was disappointed. The plot and writing just didn't sound like Patterson to me, so I'm tempted to believe that perhaps Howard Roughan had more to do with writing this book than James Patterson. I don't have a problem with that, other than the next time I look for something written by Patterson, I'll want to make sure it isn't co-authored, especially if I'm paying cash for a book I want as a keeper. This story was simply a re-tell of so many stories that I've read before with the same plot, characters, etc. And I wasn't happy about the ending either. To be honest, when I read a mystery, I love a little romance included to spice it up, but I really do want the mystery to be a little more effective. Let's face, writing about the \\"the black widow\\" theme is almost like riding a good horse to death. This was an average read, but to Patterson's fans, once they've read Honeymoon, they'll know exactly what I mean.	2005-03-12

I don't like to see immediate sex in my romance reading. <br /> <br />Mitch Warner is the millionaire son of a U.S. Senator.  He's also a solidly confirmed bachelor that is dead set against marriage.  What's more, he values his privacy and refuses to deal with nosy reporters.  He's just not prepared to deal with Tori Barnett, a free-lance writer that's out to get Mitch's story for the editor of a magazine company where Tori works.  <br />Tori's return to her hometown isn't just for doing a story on Mitch.  She's actually there to be a bride's maid for her best friend's wedding.  She meets up with Mitch, a rancher, in the bar where she's having a few drinks with the wedding party.  Being smitten by her good looks and physically attracted, Mitch asks her dance and they end up dancing the night away.  But before the night comes to an end, they're also getting it on under a blanket in the bed of Mitch's pickup truck, hot and heavy. <br />Tori realizes that she's not exactly the type of woman a man wants to take home and present to his family as his future bride.  But once he's finally bitten by the love bug, Mitch doesn't really care about Tori's past.  His main concern is their future. <br />This story moved along a little too quickly in the sex area for me, but it's not a bad read.  <br />	2005-02-20

But that doesn't stop the feisty herbalist from being distraught when she spots heavy equipment destroying her plants. Big-time defense attorney, Jason Brooks, happens to be the land owner and he's getting ready to build a landing strip for his airplane. He's also quick to inform Perse that she's trespassing, thus, the two get started off on the wrong foot when they first meet. <br />She soon learns that Brooks is divorced and that his mother and young daughter are also residing in the attorney's new home.  His mother has a drinking problem, while the rebellious daughter is a discipline problem, both requiring a lot of time, something that a busy defense attorney doesn't have too much of. Perse befriends both the mother and daughter. <br />Even though she attends a local Christian church regularly, Perse is an herbalist who runs the Mt. Olympus Natural Healing Center. After all, she's been named for the Goddess of Seasons.  But some of the local folks don't approve of her vocation or her business and dubbed Perse as a practicing witch.  This doesn't seem to bother Jason. <br />Love blooms between Perse and Jason, despite the return of Jason's ex-wife and his majority ownership in a soon-to-be built commercial hog farm, which Perse and several others of the community are dead set against. <br />This is a cute and light-hearted romance story...and a tad bit different. <br />	2005-02-20

US	52746777	R27EQ19NAERDB9	1563119722	442883463	Murder in the Heartland: Book Two	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Interesting....but....lacking	Former Williamson County Sheriff (1982-89), Harry Spiller, draws heavily from his experience during his tenure as a law enforcement officer to write his latest book titled Murder In The Heartland-Book 2. Although this book doesn't come close to that of the late Darcy O'Brien's Murder In Little Egypt, Spiller still has to be commended for his efforts. <br />One half of this non-fiction book covers the apprehension and murder trial of Dr. Allen Azevedo, accused and charged with the murder of his ex-wife four (4) years after Marie Azevedo's bullet-riddled body was discovered in her ditched vehicle by a farmer in rural southern Illinois. <br />Dr. Azevedo, a dentist, had an iron-clad alibi for his whereabouts at the estimated time of Marie's death.  He also passed a polygraph test that he had nothing to do with the killing of his ex-wife. <br />As this case file progresses, it becomes quite clear that Marie and Allen Azevedo have gone through a bitter divorce and child custody battle.  Marie wanted to take the children out of the country for a visit and Dr. Azevedo feared she wouldn't bring them back. <br />But this case has so many ends and outs and twists and turns that makes it seem almost unreal, but keeps the reader wondering what in the world is NEXT. <br />Dr. Azevedo was employed by the State of Illinois as dentist for prisoners held at the Menard Penitentiary in Illinois.  When he makes a deal with inmates Joe Hatchett and Derrick Cook for a contract to have Marie killed, he becomes a victim of a scam.  He's told the deal is set to go, pays $2000 front money, which the two inmates keep with no intention of having Marie's murder contracted out. <br />Hatchett was released from prison and returned to Chicago only to be arrested again and returned to Menard, where he later learned that Marie Azevedo had been murdered. He assumed Dr. Azevedo had hired someone else to kill Marie and thought the dentist should be reported to the police. <br />Cook later agreed to wear a recorder and make contact with the dentist, calling Dr. Azevedo to tell him the police had been questioning Cook about Marie's murder.  After being bilked out of $2000, the dentist told Cook to get lost.  Later on, Dr. Azevedo was contacted again by a person identifying himself as \\"R\\" in what Azevedo thinks is a blackmail attempt.  He goes to the authorities and informs them about this.  From here, the phone conversations that later transpired between \\"R\\" and Sheriff, Bill Kilquest (disguising his voice as Dr. Azevedo in a telephone sting) makes this case file almost boring. <br />Finally, the case turns interesting again when authorities felt they had enough evidence to charge Dr. Azevedo with his wife's murder. <br />Enter defense attorney, Brocton Lockwood.         The trial was set for June 3, 1985, but was delayed because the police had received further information.  One of the suspected killers had been arrested in Chicago and was returned to Jackson County on July 17th. Jury selection began on the 19th. States Attorney John Clemmons gave a 1-1/2 hour opening statement before introducing Derrick Cook as the state's first witness. Cook told the jury about being wired and on camera, and about the telephone sting involving Sheriff Kilquist. <br />Defense Atty Lockwood began his opening statement by telling the jury to \\"take note of the evidence that is NOT included in the 6,000 page report prepared by the state.\\"  Lockwood went on to say, \\"Don't assume the defendant is guilty just because he has been charged and it is in the press.  Set aside your natural feelings that if a defendant did not do something wrong then he would not be here.\\" <br />As this case unfolds in court, Lockwood's competence as a superb defense attorney shines through.  After 11 days of trial, 48 witnesses, and 71 exhibits, SA Clemmons rested the state's case. <br />To the SA's surprise, Lockwood stood up and asked the judge for a directed verdict and that the case against Dr. Azevedo bedismissed. <br />From here, I don't intend to tell what happened. This case file is well worth reading. Allen Azevedo later met with an ill-fated death.   And what happened to the killer that was found in Chicago and charged with Marie's murder? Yeah, read the book. <br />I might add one other tidbit about this case that makes it even more interesting.  Azevedo's defense attorney, Brocton Lockwood, taught law courses from 1972-78 before accepting an appointment as Associate Circuit Judge in Williamson County, serving on the bench from 1978 until 1983, during which time he became the main player in the FBI sting \\"Operation Greylord\\".  After his work was finished with Operation Greylord, Lockwood returned to southern Illinois, stepped down from the bench, and re-entered private law practice, which was truly a stroke of luck for Dr. Allen Azevedo.   <br />Lockwood has since left his private practice to accept another Associate Circuit Judge position for Saline County, Illinois either sometime in 1999 or 2000. He has written a book about his experience while on assignment to assist with the case overload in Chicago, a very interesting story indeed.  Operation Greylord is another book well worth reading. <br />As for the rest of the case files in Murder In The Heartland-Book 2, they were shorter and didn't come up in comparison.  This book could have used a good editor as some of the words were misspelled and changed the entire context of a sentence.  Another reason for the 3-Star rating. <br />  <br />	2005-02-08

I've probably given her as man one-star or two-star ratings as anyone else. For sure, she tells it like it is, and although some of her detail description gets to be too much, one has to back up and think about it. Hey, that's the way it is in the real world and that's the way most hardened criminals talk and think. I found no offense in this because once I got to the theme of where she was going, it was what I expected. I think SB has written some really wonderful books, this just isn't one of her best. BUT, on the other hand, it isn't one of her worst either. The characters are strong and well-defined and I kept wondering how in the world she would ever tie Jack Sawyer to all of this as to why he came back to protect Anna Corbett from the Herbold brothers. And the mystery surrounding Patsy McCorkle's death had me wondering what in the world too. I gave this book a three because that's what I thought it was...average.	2005-01-25

This book was among a few others that I found in a box of books in a basement. I knew by the book's size and large print that it would be a quick read, and that's what I was looking for, something quick to read. So I sat down and started, thinking this was going to be another one of those stories where the wife and husband are at odds and it will go from there. Well, that was somewhat true, but after learning that Harry's son, Bob, suffered from depression just like Harry, and he had sense enough to get tested and to save his marriage, well, I was simply thrilled by this little book. Love stories are supposed to have a happy ending, although life doesn't always coat it with pretty colors as we'd like. This story had a good ending, even though the years Bob could have shared with his father and didn't, had slipped away. IF Bob didn't feel the father-son relationship that most boys require when they are growing up, it was simply because Harry was sick and didn't know how to tell him...or express his emotions. So the old man, while failing in health and losing his memory, wrote his emotions in his Letters to Emily.  Grant it, I could see where this book did need an editor's touch, but when you're totally engrossed in a good story, you overlook that and keep reading. This must be Camron Wright's first attempt at writing, and he does remind me of Nicholar Sparks too. Regardless, I'm glad I had the chance to read this book and I highly recommend it to anyone, any age, in any given situation that requires good sound advice about trying to face life's problems. This is an excellent read.	2005-01-22

Yet, as a reader, I found myself hoping the next page I turned would really start the story.  And then, she would do that in bits and pieces, but she would revert back and forth to the victim description again.  It wasn't until I'd gotten about half way through the book that I'd quit jumping ahead.  But by then, I didn't want to put it down.  Grant it, I can see where she might have felt she owed them that much, as well as the families of the victims.  But a writer must remember that the reader wants a page turner filled with action. <br />Ann is a favorite of mine.  And because of the research, effort and time she put into this story, I wanted to give this book a better rating.  TOO MUCH victim description and police procedure wouldn't excite an avid reader of true crime.  Regardless, I still think Ann is a very talented and wonderful writer of non-fiction, true crime.  This just wasn't one of her better efforts.  Sorry Ann. <br />	2005-01-21

It was an okay read, but at times I found myself confused in the plot, wondering if Mary was having flashbacks or what. Of course, we all know Mary Magdalene was a special woman in the life of Jesus. This is a work of fiction and I feel the writer just decided to write a fiction story based on perhaps her own personal beliefs, or should I say perhaps the way she wanted to believe it may have happened. This is the first book I've read by this particular author and because I had a hard time staying with the plot, I doubt I read anything else she's written.  I feek that fiction writers should stick to fiction and not waver into areas where perhaps they shouldn't go.	2005-01-14

The relationship gets off to a rough start between Stella and Luke, but he finally asks her to go to Graceland with him, and their relationship takes on a new meaning from there.  In the meantime, a long-distant relative, Haley, arrives on the scene. The girl is pregnant, unmarried, and alone after the death of her father. Roz takes Haley in and gives her a job too.  The story just sort of fizzled out at the end, or else I was expecting a lot more than what I got.  This isn't one of the best romance novels that has Nora Roberts stamped all over it, but it's a sweet and fast read, even though I felt like the vast description of all the flowers was a little too much, but then again, to each their own when it comes to writing a novel.  The characters were strong, but that's about it for me. This is the first book of IN THE GARDEN trilogy. The book was a holiday gift to me for which I'm always thankful to be remembered this way, and I'm glad I read it but I wouldn't brag about this book to anyone else.  Hope the second book is better than the first. <br />	2005-01-06

It is written that it took Susanna Clarke ten years to write this novel.  I don't doubt that in the slightest. I thought at first it might take me ten years to read it.  I ordered the book this past October and couldn't wait to start reading what others have billed as the adult version of Harry Potter. Perhaps, but I myself didn't see it that way. After I started reading, I found my mind wandering to other things and I knew immediately that this book wasn't holding my attention. So, I set it down and picked up another book, which I read in its entirety within a week.  It bugs me to start a novel and not finish it, but I wasn't at all enthused about going back to Clarke's novel. But the more I thought about it, I couldn't imagine anyone working ten years on just one book. So I made myself start reading it again. It wasn't until I'd read well into the book about half way, or let me say to Chapter 42, Strange Decides to Write a Book. From this point on, I found myself with a totally different attitude since the book had begun to hold every moment of my attention. <br />I only wish I could give this book a better rating because the last half of this novel is very good. But that's just it. The first half nearly bored me to tears. I am glad I stayed with it and finished it...finally. I do commend the writer for the vast amount of work that must have gone into her efforts.  BUT, the book is entirely too big and hard to hold. My fingers grew tired just from the book's weight. The print was too small for me.  And the punctuation seemed to be totally ignored. Thus, those are my reasons for giving the book only three stars.  Had this book been about half the size it is, covering the last half of its story, then I think Clarke had a wonderful plot, her characters were excellent, and her prose very good. <br />	2004-12-30

Of course, I HAD to put it there. But I'm sure glad I did. I love to read debut novels, it absolutely thrills me. Especially when I get my hands on a good book like \\"Falling Star\\". I can't compliment Diana Dempsey enough on her first effort. She's very knowledgeable about the world of television news network, and she definitely has a way with prose to create a writing style of her very own.  The ups and downs in the life of TV news anchor, Natalie Daniels, will make a reader want to keep going, page after page, to see what can possibly happen next to this woman.  It's a great plot with great characters, well written, and a great read. <br />I just this evening ordered two other novels written by Diana Dempsey. That's how impressed with her talent that I am. <br />Congrats, Diana, on a job well done.	2004-11-12

This is the first of the new Irish trilogy for me. I stayed with the book, but it really didn't turn me on until the end. I think the part I enjoyed the most was when Jude makes up her mind to sell her condo in Chicago and make the permanent move to Ireland. Jude's decision that writing is what she wanted to do really showed the inspiration of a true artist. The romance wasn't what I expected, although I don't know what it was I really expected either. It just seems that I've read too many of NR's stories lately where the heroine is not \\"sure of herself\\" and sets out to find the real person inside. This is not one of the better books with Nora Roberts indicated as the author. It's a quick read, which is not the norm for NR either. Catch it at the library if you're a real NR fan.	2004-11-07

I ordered the book from Amazon.com and started reading it the same day it arrived. Since it's a small book, I had it finished in a day. But then I couldn't put it down either. Fanning did an excellent job of describing in detail the events that took place, as well as the trial. I can't help but wonder what drives a writer to want to speak directly with a convicted killer. Surely she knew that getting inside this man's twisted and tormented mind wasn't likely to happen. And yet, Sells apparently respected Mrs. Fanning enough to tell her as much as he did. I was living in southern Illinois not more than forty miles from Ina when Sells killed the Keith Dardeen family. I spoke directly to an IDCI agent about the horrendous crime. He stated that without a doubt it had to be the worst he'd ever seen in his entire career in law enforcement. It's sad that so many men have been sentenced to life in prision for crimes they may have committed, only later to be released because DNA proved this to be the case. But when a person like Sells is placed on death row for a crime he admitted to doing, I see no reason to prolong his stay there. He may well have been a victim of abuse as a child, and his childhood anything but healthy. But are we to believe that this sad state of affairs is to blame for his pre-meditated and vicious crimes of killing innocent children. I think not. If true crime readers enjoy a gorey crime story, then Fanning's Through The Window will be for them. I do highly recommend this book for being well written and providing the facts as they appeared to happen.	2004-11-06

Nice writing is about all I can say for Sylvia Browne's book about LIFE ON THE OTHER SIDE. No doubt, she paints a pretty picture and we all want to think it might be the way she has described it. This book was loaned to me by a very close friend because she wanted my honest opinion. I'm glad she did, because I know now I wouldn't waste my money or time looking for anything else written by Mrs. Browne. For those who truly are gifted, IF they've read any of this book or viewed Browne's web page, then I know they must be laughing because I am. There were parts of this book that were so unbelievable that I can't imagine Browne would think most humans to be so gullible. I think she's gone a little far myself, but like everything else I happen to believe, that too is between Browne and her maker. True, we do have some of the same opinions about God, and she listed some really good titles by other authors in this particular book.There are a lot of folks that will take time for Browne, no doubt, because the wool can be pulled over their eyes. However, Browne needs to know one thing: You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time. <br />I DO NOT recommend this book, or any other books by this author, especially after viewing her web page and seeing the enormous fees she charges for a reading. It's not about the money, Sylvia, ...it's about the gift.	2004-11-03

I've been there a time or two myself. But make no mistake, Northern Lights is a great read. I'm a romantic, and I didn't even notice there wasn't a lot of romance and great love scenes until after I'd finished reading this novel. I can honestly say, it was too long, but it held my interest continuously and I enjoyed every minute of this novel. I wanted to give it four stars because it was too long, but how could I when I could barely put it down. I'd recommend this book to all mystery readers, but if you're looking for NR's usual hot sex scenes, then this one isn't going to do it for you.	2004-10-21

That's what I have to say about Tim Cockey's latest novel, BackStabber. Although I had a hard time getting into the book at first, after the first few chapters I decided to keep going in hopes the plot would take enough of a turn to keep me interested. I had no idea where this author was headed when he jumped from a murder scene to picking up a cadaver in a nursing home where he met up with a resident who happened to be an older lady acquaintance. And there were some scenes that I just couldn't buy. But then again, it's fiction. So I gave Mr. Cockey the benefit of a doubt and kept going. And the story began to take on different twists and turns. I did think it got to be a bit too wordy at times, but I managed to skip over what I thought was just that...too wordy. <br />However, I thought the character of Hitchcock Sewell was well developed.  It's a shame the author stuck a name like Hitchcock on such a handsome hunk of a man. I have a thing about the names, and if the hero is described as a handsome hunk, then I think his name should fit the description as well. And let's face it, there's just nothing sexy about a name like Hitchcock. No offense meant, of course. I wish now I'd read this author's debut novel instead of this latest published novel. And I may do that yet. I think Mr. Cockey is a very talented writer. The prose flows well, and he displays a keen sense of humor along with his ideas for an excellent plot. I was quite surprised when I'd finished the book to learn how he'd managed to bring the plot of this particular story all together. I just hope he doesn't get into a rut by writing too many Hitchcock Sewell mysteries, because I think Mr. Cockey has too much talent not to write something different. <br />	2004-10-20

I'll have to admit the book cover sounded interesting enough, but it seems NR gets into everything by threes, and it gets to be a bit much. I thought the women in this book were as goofy as all get-out, as well as an embarrassment to the female gender. And I never cared much for that. She had all the couples climbing into bed together too soon. The plot surrounding the Three Fates was a great idea, but the prose failed to follow through. I still think NR's first books were some of her best, and I still believe she's one of the greatest romance writers of all times. I'm just not big on this book. I've read much better with NR's name on the cover.	2004-09-19

I enjoyed Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas so much that I had to purchase JP's latest go at the romance genre. I thought the story was a quick and tender tale of life's sad experiences for Jennifer. Deep inside Mr. Patterson, I think there's a mystery writer wanting to break out and write romance, however, I just happen to think he's a better mystery writer.  The plot and characters were okay, but pretty much a repeat of his last attempt at writing romance.  When an exceptional writer like Patterson puts out a small book that is a quick and easy read, and with a predictable plot, then I have to wonder if he isn't being pushed to get something published. I'm a Patterson fan, so I'll buy another one of his books, but not if the cover indicates a romance genre.     <br />	2004-08-15

It was a real treat reading about a few of this PI's case files and Lipset's struggle with getting into the investigative business, let alone his opinion about the entire legal system. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the part about Lipset's personal life as well, a marriage with differences in religion, and then dealing with the loss of his wife. Without a doubt, Holt has me convinced that Hal Lipset was one of the greatest private investigators ever.  This writer told a wonderful and interesting story. A job well done.	2004-08-09

I don't know how Kristin wrote this story without crying her eyes out the whole time. But then, maybe she did. This has to be one of the sweetest stories I've read in a long time, heartbreaking in more ways than one, but the end results will warm your heart. They say most fiction writers base a lot of their story content on real life circumstances, and I know this can be true. Still, you wonder how one mother can be so heartless to her own daughter, while another woman can come along to pick up the pieces, and feel blessed just being able to do so. My hat is off to Kristin on this one, she's written a remarkable novel. And she's right...The Things We Do For Love...are too numerous to mention. <BR>I can't wait for Kristin's next novel. I totally recommend this book to anyone for their reading pleasure.	2004-07-18

I was hooked on the Stephanie Plum series from the very start. I've met this lady and she's a real sweetheart, so it hurts me to read a mediocre piece of work that she's written. Perhaps I expect too much. I have to agree she needs to write something new and different. She's got a good thing going with Joe and Ranger, and her relationships with both men will keep you guessing. But this book has a bit too much silliness in it for me. I think a person getting arrested for stealing chips off a potato chip truck is a little far-fetched. And even though Janet had a good idea for a great plot with this one, the ending just didn't fit at all. It seemed like she was at a loss for words and just didn't know how else to end this story. There were times when the writing didn't even sound like Janet, so I had to wonder about this one. Like I said, she's one of my very favorite authors, so I won't give up reading her future novels. I just hope she takes more time with the next one.	2004-07-06

I thought it was the maybe even the best, but that was before I read The Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown weaves a tale that keeps the reader wanting to turn quickly to the next page to see what happens next. Robert Langdon is another later version of Indiana Jones, but to my way of thinking, the characterization of Langdon is even BETTER than that of Indiana Jones. I hold nothing but the greatest of admiration for Dan Brown for his intelligence and wit in the writing of this novel. And even more so, because Brown takes the reader where most authors fear to tread. And he does it so well at that. I only wish I could give this book a ten-star rating.	2004-06-11

I'd purchased it some time ago and was the middle of reading another novel. So I loaned it to my daughter to read first. Then she loaned it to someone else. Next thing I know, I've purchased Angels and Demons and I'm reading it first. After I'd finished reading Angels and Demons, I immediately got in touch with my daughter and told her to get The Da Vinci Code back for me to read. Well, I just finished reading it...non-stop...and I hold the highest of respect and praise for Dan Brown as an excellent writer. After reading the book, I almost knew there would be a great many book reviews because of the book's subject matter and plot. Let's face it, any time an author writes about religion or politics, he's in for the scalding of a lifetime if his story touchs a nerve. Brown no doubt has touched nerves, and it isn't about how he writes because there's no doubt he's a very talented writer. It's more about the subject he picks to write about. I've never seen it fail, you get someone to make a comment about someone else's religion or politics, and you'll get a hot response every time. They aren't really seeing the story but only the subject matter. It's sort of like not seeing the forest for the trees. This is the second book I've read in the last three days for Dan Brown, and now I'm on my way to the bookstore to buy another one of his novels. I can't wait for his next novel.  I can't wait to see this book made into a motion picture either.  You go, Dan. ;-)	2004-06-11

It's a fiction story, but then again, Kerley is basing his story on real life actions on a newly organized section of the Mobile police department. Grant it, there are politics in every law enforcement agency, but I guess I thought this story went a little overboard. Then in the first person narrative, which I think authors should shy away from with a debut novel, Carson Ryder, the PISS-IT detective is getting romantic ideas about an alcoholic ME, which he tries to help with her problem and ends up getting it on. That's okay too, always expected to my way of thinking. But the story is pretty much the same thing and I was looking for something new. Grant it, I had no idea who the killer really was until Kerley revealed the identity at the end, but then again, I guess I've been reading too many suspense/mystery books, because they are all beginning to sound the same. I keep telling myself this is fiction, but even fiction has to have a degree of nonfiction to make the story believable. I think Kerley's debut novel is pretty good, but not all that great. I read it from start to finish without stopping and can't say I didn't enjoy the read, because I did. This newbie writer has a lot of talent and I'm looking forward to his next novel. And like everything else in this life, we learn  how to do it better with experience (doing it again) and future research and learning. My hat's off to Jack Kerley on this one, it was definitely different and very deep, but just a little on the far-out side for me.	2004-06-03

But it was the first person narrative used by the different characters, along with multiple changes in the POV, that floored me.  This writer?s talent shines through with the ability to capture and constantly hold the reader?s attention with this style of writing.  It?s a difficult task for the most seasoned of writers, but Ellis does this like it?s old hat in her debut novel.  I never once lost my train of thought with the frequent switching of narrative identity.<BR>My favorite character in this book was not necessarily the main character.  I enjoyed the neighbor, Ernie Marriseau.  He was the epitome of a perfect husband and a wonderful person.  Yet, like all of us, Ernie had his flaws too.<BR>Ellis brings about the paranormal just when it fit perfectly into the story.  I must admit that I greatly admire this author?s talent. I couldn?t put the book down because I didn?t want to stop reading.  I?m looking forward to her future novels.  I feel that Ellis has created a new style of writing that will soon become like a trademark for her, immediately recognized by avid readers and fans alike.<BR>It does the heart good to give a 5-star rating to a debut novel.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of THE TURTLE WARRIOR.  It?s a  keeper.	2004-05-16

I could see myself either tiring of this writer's work or feeling the book simply wasn't right for me. Now grant it, the book might really float someone else's boat...but not mine. I'd say if you like science fiction, then this is a fairly good book. If you don't..then don't go there. Children with wings and flying all around, and things that you just find almost impossible to believe. It's time for me to move on and read someone else's work.

I think Patterson had a way of telling this story through the diary, and yet switching back and forth between Katie and Suzanne to get his point across. I also think perhaps this story touched on his own life and it was written with heart. My thoughts anyway. Deep love is such a wonderful thing to get and have for however long we're lucky enough to have it. You could see that Matt wasn't ready for another relationship, so he walked away. But he loved Katie, so he wanted her to know &quot;why&quot; and he left her the diary. I'm putty in a writer's hands when it comes to romance, and I thought this story was a sweet one. I do think Patterson is a better mystery writer, but I'd admire his efforts on this one. I have one more book of Patterson's to read and then I'm moving on to someone else. I don't think this book was boring, but it wasn't your super-duper romance. It was just what it was...&quot;sweet&quot;.	2004-04-09

For some reason or another, it managed to find its way onto the library shelf and I just this week picked it up and wondered why I hadn't read it. So I took the time over the past two days and was glad I did. I did enjoy this book. I liked the characters and the plot that kept me turning the page and wondering how the story was going to play out. I tend to think maybe Patterson's narrating of a female in the first person was a struggle for him, or at least I thought so in certain areas. He tried to put a tad of romance in this novel and I thought his efforts were a little lame. In the first place, if you're reading a mystery and the author manages to wobble off onto romance, then as a reader you tend to expect a happier ending. I didn't like seeing Chris Raleigh killed off in this book, but hey, it's Patterson's story. I really got into the the Women's Murder Club thing though, and I'm looking forward to reading more books by Patterson in the near future. The man is a talented story-teller and I'd recommend this book to anyone.	2004-04-05

It had gotten to the point where you just knew if you'd read one of her novels, you'd read them all. She rarely varied from her plot and character descriptions. So when I picked up Ransom and read the book cover, I thought she just maybe might have decided it was time to write a mystery or suspense novel. The brief description of the story on the book's cover was indeed enticing and I purchased this latest Steel novel.  WOW! What a shocker! IF Danielle Steel wrote this book, then she's forgotten every rule she ever knew about writing. And IF she had this book edited, she should fire her editor. The story could have been a good one if the writing itself hadn't been so poorly done. I read &quot;couldn't even&quot; or &quot;didn't even&quot; so many times I couldn't believe it. And there was so much repetition that I kept going to read the entire book just to see how bad it actualy could be. I don't like to give book reviews like this one, but let's face it. Times are hard and money is tight for a lot of people that purchase a good novel for entertainment. And that's what they deserve. So, if I think a book is truly lousy and not worth the dollars, I feel I owe it to other readers to voice my honest opinion. If there was anything I could say to help this one, I would. But I think my review title pretty well says it all. In my opinion, this author needs to retire if this is the best she can do after all these years. It's like she had no pride in her work whatsoever. If she doesn't care, why should I?	2004-03-14

But she's great with kids, even children who are born with a mental handicap such a Meggie. And this was Sam's reason for hiring Christy in the first place. Sam's ex-wife, Andrea, is dying of cancer and sends Meggie to stay with her father. He's looking for a nanny to take care of Meggie because he's too busy with his work. The story revolves mostly around the three of them, with a couple of exciting scenes where Meggie is endangered and Christy saves her once and Sam saves her the second time. There are a few twists and turns to this novel that are cute, but overall, it isn't hard to tell where the plot is going. Characters are good and strong, writing is smooth and flows easily. There wasn't as much romance as I expected, but that's okay too because the story was good anyway. I had only one minor problem with this novel, which seemed to grate on my mind as I continued to read. It wasn't a biggie, but something that I continually noticed. The author kept referring over and over to Christy Lane. If I read that name once, then I lost count of how many other times I read it. Christy Lane this and Christy Lane that. She needs to watch this in her future novels. Overall, I think this author has refreshing talent. I look forward to reading more of her novels. I think she's fairly new, and I certainly wish her well.	2004-02-22

I was fortunate enough to get my hands on an ARC copy of Hoffman's first novel. It's rare that a book can claim my complete attention to the point that I CANNOT put it down to go do something else.  However, Hoffman's debut novel had me spellbound, reading non-stop until I'd reached the end.<br />If I could, I would gladly give this novel a ten-star rating.  Hoffman draws from her experience as a former State Attorney for Florida, as well as the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  This is where she acquired her credentials before she left the legal field to pursue writing murder/mystery stories.  Which, I might add, she's gained a great deal of respect.  Although both areas in the legal field are a great plus for Hoffman, that has nothing to do with her ability as a talented writer, which shines through like you wouldn't believe in this novel.<br />Hoffman begins her story in June 88 as Chloe Larsen, a struggling young law student living in NYC and studying her heart out to take the bar exam.  She's also (she thinks) in love with a creep named Michael Decker that she'd met two summers before.  She's hoping the date that she was about to have with Decker (their second anniversary) would leave her with an engagement ring and promise of marriage.  Actually, by the time Hoffman finished describing this Decker character and his part in the novel, I absolutely hated the guy.  As if being deeply disappointed by Decker's failure to show up in time for their theatre date wasn't bad enough, he later shows up to present Chloe with a beautiful, diamond-lined, heart-shaped necklace instead of an engagement ring she'd hoped for.  Naturally, being the creep that he is, Decker tries every way in the world to get Chloe into bed that evening, but she's not game.  Besides, she's faced with having to study for the upcoming bar exam she's about to take. All in all, it's just too much.  So she sends Decker away.  No doubt, Chloe later thinks, might have been her biggestmistake.  But never mind.  After Decker leaves and Chloe goes to bed, she's going to endure the most horrendous crime that can ever be imposed upon a woman.  She's raped, cut to pieces, and left for dead...not to mention that she's now a barren woman.  Chloe's whole life has changed from this point on.<br />Hoffman's description from the beginning of this story goes to a complete change in POV (point of view), which begins with Chapter #14 and the date of September 2000. She has changed her name to C.J. Townsend, and has now been employed for the past ten years with the State Attorney office in Florida.  She has her act together now and has gained a great deal of respect as C. J. Townsend, Esq., Asst. Chief, her present position as a prosecuting attorney.<br />C.J. Townsend's lovelife certainly hasn't been anything to brag about, and she's still a single woman.  But enter Dominick Falconetti, a Special Agent for the Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement.  He's a widower and he has more than a professional interest in C.J. Townsend.  This guy is SHARP, in more ways than one.  I dearly loved this character.<br />C.J. had gotten her life back together since her horrendous and unforgettable experience in NYC, until she's in the court room facing the man she's positive raped her, cut her to pieces, and then left her for dead...as well as barren.<br />It took a lot of counseling and a very long time for C.J. to get past the trauma of that horrendous night, and she's only human. She's expected to crumble after seeing her assailant in the courtroom, the man's she's now going to give her best shot at prosecuting for murder.  But what does she do?  Well, I'm not going to tell it, and that's for certain. I don't want to spoil the ending for readers who happen onto this new writer's talent.<br />This story weaves in and out so much, that it keeps the reader wondering, \\"What the hell can happen next?\\" I'm a big fan of romance, which I might add this story has just enough of.  But Hoffman surpasses my greatest expectations as a new comer in the mystery/murder writing department.  And what I like most, there aren't a lot characters in this novel that a reader has to keep up with, trying to remember who's who.  <br />I can't wait for this author's next novel.  I'll be the first to buy it as soon as it hits the shelves.  If you love a good mystery/murder story, do yourself a favor and buy a copy of \\"Retribution\\".  If I'm wrong on this one, and this novel doesn't climb all the way to the top as #1 on the NY best seller list, then I `m going to be highly disappointed, and I'd like  for someone to tell me why.<br />You go, Julianne!  Right straight to the top, girl!  I'll be watching you all the way.	2004-01-08
US	52746777	R1S8YJZ11T480I	0446353957	702961086	Mirror Image	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Best novel yet for SB for me...	I've read several Sandra Brown novels, of which some I thought were totally boring. But I have to hand it to SB on this one, her talent came through like a shining star. I didn't want to stop reading and thought the plot was one of her best ever. The characters were strong and well described, and the suspense was intense. I love it when I get to the end and I'm still trying to figure out \\"WHODUNNIT?\\" That's how it was with MIRROR IMAGE. I will have to agree with another reviewer that some of the sex scenes were a little too descriptive, which didn't really add anything to this story. She probably could have left out some of that and it would have given the story a little more class. Regardless, this novel is good for a 5-star rating and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a romance that's laced with great suspense. My only other problem with the prose is that I think SB at times will tend to try too hard in showing off her knowledge of words, and she gets a little too carried away in using descriptive words that aren't often used and may be a little TOO much for the average reader. I truly did enjoy this novel, which was first published in 1990 and is being reprinted again for SB like several of her other works. For those new SB fans, this one is guaranteed not to disappoint.	2003-12-28

No doubt she spent a great deal of time with the preparation and research in writing SHATTERED HOPES.  The acknowledgments are quite extensive to those who assisted in this writing endeavor, and I do highly recommend this nonfiction piece of work as a very good read.<BR>     The murder of Diane Masters in 3/82 is still an open file, even though the persistent investigation of then Sgt. John Reed of the Cook County Sheriff's office eventually landed convictions for Diane's husband, Alan Masters (an attorney) and his two accomplices, Corbett (a former Chief of Police) and Keating (a former Cook County Sheriff's lieutenant). The sad part about this is that the convictions didn't happen until 1989. The strong arm of the law moves at a snail's pace, especially when that's what those involved expect. Even so, the file still remains open and no one was actually charged with Diane's murder. Convictions were handed down for bribery, taking payoffs, case fixing, conspiring to murder Diane Masters, aiding, abetting and soliciting her death that brought forth twenty year sentences, as well as a fine for Alan Masters.  Sadly to say, however, Reed's involvement in the investigation managed to get him removed from his investigator's position, which was a true slap in the face for doing his job. It wasn't until 7/93 that a major shakeup in the Sheriff's office saw Reed being taken off the shelf and promoted to lieutenant. Reed's previous demotion for a job well done is a prime example of what can happen to an honest cop trying to do the job right; proper enticement, no doubt, for making a good cop want to turn his head the other way when corruption within the brotherhood is staring them in the face.<BR>    Schaaf's research had her making note of more crime and corruption that was exposed by a FBI sting operation dubbed as OPERATION GREYLORD. If you haven't read this true story about Judge Brocton Lockwood, then do yourself a favor and try to find a copy somewhere. I dearly value mine. In 1978, after being newly appointed as an Associate Circuit Judge in Southern Illinois, Lockwood was expected to serve a six-week stint in Chicago to help reduce the backlog of cases in the Cook County system. Lockwood was quickly made aware of the official corruption and misconduct running rampant in the judicial system, stating that bribery was an open, established practice ruled by bagmen. Court decisions were bought and sold like commodity futures. As Lockwood's story was being written, it had been four years since the GREYLORD prosecutions began. At that time, 70 persons to include 11 judges, 38 lawyers, 7 police officers, 10 deputy sheriffs, 3 deputy clerks, and a court-appointed receiver had been convicted. OPERATION GREYLORD is truly a fascinating and revealing story into the crime and corruption of a judicial system that apparently has never felt threatened by the exposure, and neither was it affected by the murder of Diane Masters in 1982, since the crime managed to be so effortlessly covered up by the law.  <BR>    As previously stated and would be expected, the strong arm of the law does move at a snail's pace when those involved are actually members of law enforcement agencies or the judicial system. I've found it to be, that those few people who are more often in the wrong, just happen to be those who can endure to be so.	2003-11-18

As I approached the church, I noticed the sun breaking through the clouds, beaming down rays of light to shine down on the building where she lay inside, awaiting the eulogy to be given for her final goodbye. I thought my heart would break and I would never stop crying, even though I finally did. After the funeral, I stopped by my favorite bookstore and purchased four novels, two of which were written by Kristin Hannah. That evening, I made the mistake of starting to read ON MYSTIC LAKE. Because my eyelids were still swollen from the many tears I'd cried at the funeral and during the day, and my eyeballs felt like sandpaper was swiping over them every time I blinked, I thought it best to put the book down and finish reading it later. The next morning I found myself picking the novel up again. After I started to read. I couldn't stop until I'd read the rest of story, nor did I stop crying. I have to believe that Kristin Hannah has the finest talent to write the sweetest of love stories that I've ever had the pleasure to read in this novel. I have another one of her novels, but I don't dare start it right away. I need a break from the tears. KH had no trouble from the very beginning to capture of my attention. I felt every moment of Annie's heartache, as the description of the author's plot and characters was most excellent. If you want a genuine, heartfelt/heartbreaking/happy-ending love story, do this one. Just make sure you have a box of Kleen-x sitting close by. You'll need it.	2003-11-13

Once in a blue moon, and usually under special circumstances, I run across books that were written several years ago. Such is the case with John Hickman's FOR GOD, COUNTRY, and THE HELL OF IT. Recently, I had the distinct pleasure of being a weekend houseguest in the home of Hickman's widow, Louise Quinn-Hickman, a retired college professor. While there, I noticed, and read, a laminated newspaper article about Hickman and his book.  Naturally, being a writer myself, Hickman's true story had aroused my curiosity. I asked Louise if she might have an extra copy of John's book that I could purchase. Unfortunately, this was the only copy she had, and this particular book had been autographed by John, \\"To my beloved wife, Louise---with love, John.\\" He dated the autograph Jan 17 1985, which happened to be the same year the book was first published. I told Louise I would try to secure a copy of John's novel through Amazon.com but she insisted I take her copy, asking that I simply return the book via U.S. mail once I'd finished with it. I couldn't believe this wonderful woman would allow for a perfect stranger to remove the only copy she had left of her late husband's (deceased 1991) book, and I was quite honored by the fact that she trusted me enough to do so.<BR>    Hickman's true story took place in the summer of 1944, starting one month before D-Day.  Lt. John Hickman, a reconnaissance pilot, was shot down over Nazi-occupied France.  After being taken a prisoner by the Germans, he staged his escape from a moving train in a single, heart-stopping moment.  With the help of compassionate farmers and daring resistance fighters, Hickman made the long journey home---a journey that was filled with terrifying dangers, devastating comedy, and unexpected humanity. I was so engrossed in Hickman's story that at times I felt as if I'd known this man my entire life. I could just picture the wiry, little fellow with a keen mind and wonderful sense of humor. There's no doubt Hickman wasa delightful person to know. It's quite sad that a man with such a wonderful talent for penning this excellent true story only wrote the one book. I have no idea how many copies of Hickman's book sold in 1985, but to my way of thinking, it should be reprinted.  It would make a wonderful movie.	2003-11-01

So when I spotted HEART FULL OF LIES on the shelf, I didn't hesitate to buy it. I wasted no time in getting started with my reading, but I have to admit that I was really sort of disappointed with this story. There seemed to be a lack of continuity with Ann's prose, and I began to get confused about the characters. Then I thought, oh well, what to heck, just keep reading and see what happens. After reading EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE, maybe I expected too much. When I'd finished reading the book, I simply had to think that Ann was in a hurry when she wrote this piece of non-fiction. I haven't given up on Ann though, I'll still be patiently waiting for her next published novel.	2003-10-31

I'm still laughing at Franken's wonderful non-fiction piece of literary work. I probably wouldn't have purchased this book had it not been for Fox News raising such a stink about using the phrase &quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot;. But I thought if Fox was so upset about it, then this guy Franken must have something going. Of course, the pictures on the front cover said enough, but that's neither here nor there. The book has humor and great information about how things HAPPEN in politics. I've often thought Cheney was running the White House, but I guess it's Karl Rove according to Franken. I was a big O'Reilly fan for a long time, and I slowly began to realize how he was treating the guests on his program. And this thing about the Peabody &amp; Polk awards that I learned about in Franken's book, well...that really turned me off with O'Reilly. So thanks, Al.  I'll be looking forward to reading more of your Liberal books.  Keep up the good work. From the ratings you're getting on this one, looks like a lot of people like what you have to say.

It shows you how the author started out as a new/young writer. This quick read was okay, even though it was pretty predictable. SB is like any other writer, she comes up with some good ideas for a story plot at times, and at times she doesn't.  I read this story through in one day and I liked Linc a great deal. Brown has a sense of wit that always comes through in her characters. I agree the plot was a little far-fetched, but it's only fiction. I'd recommend this book as a quick romance read.	2003-09-19

I'm sorry, folks, I don't know what JE was thinking when she stuck on her name on this one. I've never heard of Hughes until I read &quot;Full Tilt&quot;, so I don't want to judge this writer either. But this collaboration was almost to the point of utterly rediculous. I know JE is a better writer than this because I have nearly all of her books, some aren't as good as others, but none compare to this one as a stinker. It's almost to the point where if a famous author's name is on a book the reader is expected to buy no matter what is being offered. If JE keeps this up, she's going to lose a lot of her fans. I realize fiction is just that, but come on, cars with talking computers that actually THINK like a human. A fiance that is an attorney, but acts totally DUMB, and the treatment Jamie Swift gave her business partner, Max Holt, was totally unbelievable. I read this book from one end to the other because I kept hoping it would get better. Unfortunately, it didn't.	2003-08-23

I have several of her novels that I've thoroughly enjoyed. She's a very talented lady. BUT, something is amiss with this book. It didn't even sound like the same author at various times in the book. One part would be flowing with extremely well-written prose, and then all of a sudden it was like WOW, where did she go and who's writing this book anyway? The plot wasn't her usual, the writing style definitely wasn't up to her usual, and I thought her characters were weak. None of this is like the MHC I've read before. Guess we all have bad days and good days. Better luck with the next one, Mary.	2003-06-02

I try to associate a certain writing style in work by new authors that I read. This is my first read for any of this author's work, and I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what style of writing she holds.  It seemed to me that Robards overused certain phrases to the point I was starting to get an attitude about Matt, such as he was a &quot;no good rotten S-O-B&quot;. Robards drove that one way past home for me. I think maybe she overused the brand names of the bath soap too. Perhaps that turned me off a little. But what really took this book down in my eyes was the description of the bedroom scenes. I'm a romantic and I thoroughly enjoy a good lovemaking scene, but I like it done with style and a little class, both were lacking here. I think the story plot was fairly good and the characters were okay, but not real strong. And having over twenty novels already published would make one assume that Robards is probably a talented writer. But this novel didn't do anything for me. I think Robards fans might want to wait for the paperback on this one.	2003-04-08

I think she is one of the very best in talented writers. And she didn't let me down with &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot;. I read the book in 1.5 days because I simply couldn't put it down. I think Valente had me completely mesmerized. But I'll have to admit, I was equally pleased with Samatha and Mack and the way that relationship evolved. More than this, the romance built in such a way that you could feel the characters falling in love with each other. And the suspense... well, I guess I read too much because I had it just about figured out before I got to the end. Still, the story was great, the writing was wonderful and as usual, McNaught didn't let me down. I have to respect this author's ability to write a story about politics that runs so true to life. I wonder how she got to be so smart. I have to say that I will highly recommend this book to my friends for future reading.  Thanks, Judi. I'm looking forward to the next novel.

But then I set it aside for a long time and finally decided to read it over the past weekend. I know Sandra Brown's name is on the cover of this book...but, I guess I'm still scratching my head about this. Envy was actually a good read. I had a problem with a big NY editor taking a prologue submitted with only the initials P.M.E. for identification and getting all excited enough to attempt to find the author. Let's get real here, NY editors would pitch something like this so fast it would make your head swim. BUT, we must remember this was a fiction story, so I allowed my imagination to run a little wild. Regardless, the plot was good, the characters played out very well, and I didn't want to stop reading. Not just a little different from some of Brown's other books I've read, it's a WHOLE LOT different. And that's about all I think I want to say here.  Great read.  Go for it.	2003-03-11

I wish I knew because she's one of my favorite authors. I guess after reading some of her other works, I'm spoiled. Although I consider this book to be just an average read, it certainly won't deter me from reading more of Scottoline's novels. While reading this novel, I felt like the author was under the gun to meet a publisher's deadline, or something like that. She made statements along the way that didn't ring true and words were misplaced in sentences that threw my train of thought off balance. Sometimes, if the story is good enough, I can overlook things like this. But when a sentence jumps out at me as being incorrectly stated, then it's either I'm reading too slow or the story doesn't have me fully engrossed. I know lawyers do write mystery stories, but I'd love to see Scottoline vary a little more on story plot. Maybe she has and I haven't read the book yet. No matter, Scottoline is a very talented writer and her reading fans are probably all like me, waiting for her next book.	2003-02-28

The book is still available if you look hard enough, even though it was written in 1989 and published in 1991.  Brock has also written a couple of other novels, namely &quot;Inside the Green Circle&quot; and &quot;Shack Town&quot;.  <BR>The book cover describes &quot;Truth Killers&quot; as a powerful page turning story of crooked politics and even dirtier crime.  A hard punching crime epic that captures the seamy underworld of crooked politicians and the low life crime they encourage.  Its about a Senator, under investigation by the Justice Department, who's flying home to Atlanta in his attempt to plug some leaks and come up with a game plan with his partners in crime, the Mayor and a crooked Councilman.  He also has problems with his estranged wife as she has blown the whistle on some huge urgan redevelopment payoffs.  And in all of this, there is one honest cop who figures out what is going on.  The book has some good twists and turns and keeps you wondering. I think what amazed me most was how Brock ended the story.  Wonder where that man learned so much about rotten politics?

I'll have to admit the beginning of Chapter 7 on page 82 really tickled me.  Apparently, Martini/Madriani has his own views on journalism's &quot;spin&quot; nowadays.	2003-01-30

Eric Haney kept me totally engrossed in his story about INSIDE DELTA FORCE. I think it's wonderful that Haney shared this story with the world. Now we have an idea of how tough it was to get into the special forces and what some of their assignments were about. I greatly admired his telling of the thoughts he has on the actions of our government for our soldiers. This book is a well-written and well-told story. I enjoyed every page and recommend it highly.	2003-01-12

Can anyone imagine a reader of romance actually getting into a story about the Vietnam war?  Well, it's true.  I couldn't put \\"Steel My Soldiers' Hearts\\" down. I lost a classmate to the Vietnam war. He made the statement before he reported for his tour of duty over there that he would never return, and he didn't.  I've always felt he (and all the other soldiers) died needlessly in a political war the U.S. shouldn't have gotten involved with in the first place. After reading Hack's book, I guess I've come to realize the military leaders involved in Vietnam weren't any different than the CEOs or officers of giant U.S. corporations today. They only care about what will benefit them, like a body count of the enemy, or whatever will bring about their next promotion, looking good for a maneuver they didn't have anything to do with in the first place. And if they did get in on the action, it was a major snafu.  If those inexperienced military officers, probably sons of politicians, would have had to get down on the ground and fight the enemy face to face like the other soldiers, or try to step around the land mines to keep from getting killed, perhaps a different outlook and approach would have been taken in Vietnam.  Hackworth was a real leader of his troops.  There should be more leaders like him. His men gave him their very best.  Great story.	2002-12-28

Better yet, getting to read her earlier work written as Stephanie Hall. I honestly don't know what I expected, but this book highly disappointed me. One thing for certain, after reading Full House,there could be no doubt about how far Janet has evolved from writing romance to mystery. For sure, she needs to stick to mystery because she obviously isn't a romance writer. She's still one of my favorites because of her humor, but this book shows undeveloped talent prior to the Stephanie Plum series. I can't/don't recommend this one.	2002-12-02
US	52746777	R2YPHP86TJTKB2	1575667630	47300534	Kentucky Sunrise	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great novel!	This is my first Fern Michaels novel to read. I purchased the book because I live close to Kentucky and I enjoy novels involving horses and dogs. This one looked like a winner to me after reading the book cover.  I thought the ending was a little strange. Not many people will dig up the remains from out of the graves, horses or human. Still, it was her story so to each their own. I could feel the characters and the pain of Emmie. I could also understand the perfectionist in Nealy. But more than anything, I enjoyed the plot and thought the story flowed very well. Family situations like this one that Michaels wrote about actually does exist in the world today, so it was a believable story to me. I think perhaps when reading a work of fiction, one should take into consideration that the words are only fiction and concentrate on the story. We may not the like the characters, or care for the outcome, but if the story is good and you can feel the emotion...want to keep turning the page, then Michaels has accomplished what she set out to do...write a good story. I'll be checking the library for some of her other works. I, for one, do recommend &quot;Kentucky Sunrise&quot; for a good read.	2002-11-20
US	52746777	R1P6UWKBQQPWJD	0399149392	363923998	Chesapeake Blue (Quinn Brothers)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Not surprised by the story's plot, but enjoyed the read	OK, Roberts style prevailed once again in Chesapeake Blue and I've always admired her style. I read every one of the Quinn Brothers trilogy and was anxiously waiting for this book. I purchased the book right off the bat for my collection. I brought it home and started reading immediately. This is a typical Nora Roberts story. Seth, the young grandson of Ray Quinn has grown into manhood, he's a famous artist, having traveled to Europe for his fame and fortune. And as expected, he is being blackmailed by the villian, his mother, for more money to feed her nasty habits. And on his return home, the scenes with his family are emotional and well-described, as Roberts knows how to do so well. So if I expected the story to read along the plot lines that it did, why am I giving it a four rating? It was Roberts' style of writing, which I've always admired. The book held my interest even though I had the ending figured out. And it made me cry. If a book keeps me wanting to turn the page, it deserves at least a four. Grant it, this isn't one of her best, especially like the other three, but it was worth my effort and my money. The story is heartwarming and predictable. I think she left enough characters to go on with a sequel with this one, Aubrey, Will, etc.  We'll see. Like I said, it has her (Roberts) style and I like that.	2002-11-15

This book appears to be a nice start for Jennifer Weiner with her first novel, \\"Good in Bed\\". I sort of felt the title was a little misleading and gave the wrong impression, but it went with the storyline, so I overlooked that part of the book and enjoyed the reading of each chapter. I like rare and different names for the main characters of any novels, but Cannie didn't turn me on very much either. I also like names that I find easy to pronounce instead of those way out of reach tongue-twisters. But to each their own.  The plot was cute and the story moved along quickly. This is a different style book than I'm used to reading, and I must give Weiner credit for writing about larger-than-average women. After all, those women need TLC as much as anyone. And it's refreshing that the heroine isn't a sexy super model. Change is good.  The story was warm and written with feeling. I didn't care for some of the dialogue, but here we go again, today's modern women may just talk that way.  As for me, I suppose I'm old fashioned, and some words I find a little offbeat in Weiner's story, but not bad. I give the novel a four because of the above mentioned things that tend to turn me off.  Otherwise, I think this new author is going to do well in the literary world. I'll be reading more of her work.	2002-11-13

I was thrilled beyond words when I read, \\"One For The Money\\" and still a happy camper with \\"Two For The Dough\\". But after reading High Five, I suppose I should have stopped there, because I jumped to Hard Eight. This means I still haven't read 3,4, 6 and 7. It may be a while before I got back and read these novels, although I own 3 & 4.  Maybe I'm thinking the characters and the storyline is beginning to get too repetitious for me. She's still having her on-again/off-again fling with Morelli; she's still chasing the FTAs and depending on Ranger to bail her out of trouble. And just how many cars is she going to destroy and he will keep replacing? The only thing different in this book is Stephanie paying her debt to Ranger for his help with her body and that wasn't some of Janet's greatest writing either. I would have thought she would take more time with this scene and she didn't. The ending of the book was just cut off like she was tired of writing about it and ended it there. I think Janet's humor and wit are the greatest and I do enjoy her writing. But this book didn't do it for me like some of her others and in all fairness, I'm not sure if it's her or me. I'll read more of her work later on, but after Hard Eight (and I couldn't connect the title with anything in this book either), I'm due for something different.	2002-11-13

This book was assigned for reading by the moderator of my library book review group. At first I was really disappointed because the last book had been a real bummer. I read the first chapter and thought I had another bummer. But I was determined to finish the whole book come [any obstacle]. So I made myself start reading again.  Well, was I ever in for a surprise.<BR>The Prologue begins in 1838 with George Catlin, the artist, who had been allowed to paint the People of the Mandan tribe, to include the greatest Indian Chief of all, Four Bears.  Then Chapter One begins in the summer of 1169, when a Welsh yellow-haired prince named Madoc, and his brother, have sailed toward the new land.  From this point on until the end of Chapter Eight, the author writes about Madoc's trials and tribulations with the natives after arriving in this new land.<BR>Chapters Nine through Seventeen pretty much tells how the \\"marked drawings\\"  of Madoc, later desribed as the \\"Magic Bundle\\" are handed down through the generations for safe-keeping.<BR>From Chapter Eighteen on, this author had my complete attention.  I could NOT put the book down because my ancestors are Cherokee.<BR>Although there were times I felt the author was drawing the book out over too long of a time frame, it wasn't until I finished reading the book that I realized how well written and researched this book had been.<BR>The last few chapters had me in tears. Although written as a work of fiction, in my heart I could very well imagine this story to be as true as any nonfiction book I've ever read.<BR>I have nothing but the highest respect and admiration for this author, James Alexander Thom.  May the Great Spirit be with him, guiding his thoughts and his hand as he embarks on his next novel. I'll be waiting to read it.  <BR>My opinion of this book?  It's one of the best written books I've had the pleasure to read.	2002-11-06

But I think Janet may have gotten into a hurry in writing her second PLUM novel and quit too quick. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but not as much as the first PLUM novel. And I'm already out of order with my numbers since I've read High Five before #3 & #4. But I did purchase the third and fourth novels and Full House, so I have a lot of reading to keep me busy. Janet has some really greats characters for some really outstanding plots. She's witty and I love to read her dialogue.  This is great!!!!	2002-10-21

Janet Evanovich has just acquired another fan after reading One For The Money. This book was recommended to me by one of my reading buddies. &quot;Try Evanovich.  You'll like her.  I'd bet money on it.&quot; That's what she said to me. So I stopped by the local library and checked out Evanovich's first novel because I was told to read the books in the order they were written from first to last. I started reading the book late in the evening and couldn't put it down. The wit and humor Evanovich displayed in her two characters, Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli, was some of the best I've read to date. The plot was fabuluous, even though I almost had it figured out before getting to the end of the story. Still, I enjoyed every minute I devoted to this book and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery novel with a fresh approach. I'm headed to the library now to return this book and hope to pick up &quot;Two For The Dough&quot;. I have great expectations for another excellent read and I doubt Evanovich lets me down.	2002-10-02

I guess I've been spoiled by reading Hoag's \\"Lucky's Lady\\" and \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" which I thought were great books.  So I grabbed \\"Dark Horse\\" off the shelf expecting the same exciting adventure and suspense out of Hoag. But something was lacking in the tale of Elena Estes. It certainly wasn't the quick wit and smart come-backs, so Hoag gets an A-plus from me for the dialogue. But I felt she ran too many characters into her plot and tended to bog the story down. Her love of horses and knowledge of the equestrian world certainly showed through for her, but her plot went limp at the end for me. Although I read the book almost without stopping, I really kept hoping it would get better and that just didn't happen for me.<BR>Tami Hoag is a very talented author.  And no doubt I'll buy more of her books. However, I found a couple of places where she seemed to simply \\"lose track\\" of what she was writing. For instance, on page 249 she writes about Landry during their conversation that he just looked at her, his eyes hidden by his sunglasses, his face like stone.  Then on page 250, and during the same conversation, she writes that finally, he drew a deep breath and let it out, and lied to her. She could feel it. She could see it in the way his eyes went flat and blank. Cop eyes. Good writing, but no where during this conversation did she have Landry removing his sunglasses so she could see his eyes.  In another scene, she has Landry pouring himself a couple of fingers of whiskey as old as she was, and sipped it. Again, during this same conversation, she has him sipping on his scotch. Where was Hoag's editor to let small things like this slip by?<BR>Perhaps she was on a roll and writing the story too fast. Who knows? Regardless, she ranks as high as a talented writer to my way of thinking. And I'm looking forward to reading her next novel.	2002-09-25

After reading The Power of Myth, I became so excited about what Joseph Campbell had to say that I made a special trip to the library. I was searching for anything involving Campbell's works. As luck would have it, the library just happened to have the six video recordings between Campbell and Bill Moyer on the Power of Myth. Was I ever in for a treat. After reading the book and watching Campbell &amp; Moyer in the videos, I was completely mesmerized by Campbell.  I then took time to read &quot;A Fire in the Mind&quot;, a book which covers the life of Campbell and written by Stephen &amp; Robin Larsen.  Campbell is so great in expressing himself and so knowledeable in his field, that I was totally captivated by him.<BR>I can't seem to read enough of Campbell's works, and so far, it's all been worth the time and effort.	2002-08-09

As I've stated before, the first romance books that she wrote many years ago, I thought were beautiful and well-written. A writer develops a certain type style of their very own. Roberts has done just that. Unfortunately, some of the latest books that have been published with this author's name on them, just didn't hold water that she even wrote those books. They lacked her &quot;certain&quot; style, which is a wonderful mark when she writes. HOWEVER, this book had Nora's style-stamp and I loved it. I doubt that Nora has taken a crash course in Wicca101 to write so well about the Craft, so she either did some thoroughly extensive research, or she had the help of some sisters. No matter, I love a wonderful romance story and this trilogy didn't let me down. At least I haven't lost faith that Nora does still pen a few of her own books. As for Nora writing about magic, well think about it.  Isn't romance started between two people by a spark? Sure it is. Obviously, if everyone wanted to read the same thing, a lot of writers would be in serious trouble. So you'll have conflicting opinions about any book. I've given Nora a few less stars on some of her more recent books, but believe me, this is Nora Roberts writing at her best. I really did enjoy this book. I would recommend it to anyone that loves to read romance. The love between Sam and Mia never died, the flame was just lowered. I thought Sam Logan was a great character. And I also thought the final story of this trilogy was HER BEST. That's the romantic in me.	2002-07-21

Of all the books I've read of late, this has to be one of the very best.  I wish I could give it a 10 rating.  The book was loaned to me. &quot;Read this, I think you'll like it.&quot;  Well, she was right.  I didn't just like it.  I loved it.  Being of Cherokee decent, and knowing a little about the Appalachia area, naturally that sparked my interest.  Being a native of the area, McCrumb has done a wonderful job with this novel.  She mastered the plot, the characters, the dialogue and ME.  I couldn't put the book down.  I'm putting McCrumb at the top of my list as one of my favorite authors.  The research and persons involved made this book everything that it is.  My hat is off to McCrumb.  Without further ado, I'm off to the library to gather another novel she's written.  Take my advice and get a copy of this book. You'll see what I mean.	2002-07-05

I picked the book up while shopping with a friend.  She said she had read JC's Hollywood Wives and really enjoyed it.  So, I'm always game to read something by a different author.  I didn't particularly care for the jumping back and forth from the past to the current style of writing.  And there were times I thought JC had inserted parts about characters that really weren't pertinent to the story.  I didn't particularly care for the Nando and Jolie parts.  There were times I found the scenes and the language to be a little on the crude side.  That's just my own opinion and the plot is probably typical Vegas style and California author. JC did keep the story going at a fast pace and I did enjoy Michael Castelli and Dani Castle.  I couldn't imagine any parent allowing a young teenage daughter to just take off for parts unknown like Sofia was allowed to do. Parts of the book just seemed a little far-fetched at times.  I think JC has the writing talent my friend found in Hollywood Wives, so I'll go to the library and pick this novel up to read. Deadly Embrace is a long read with unimportant characters inserted.  The author's style in writing this story doesn't make for my idea of a good read. I kept going just to see how JC would tie all the characters together in the end. On a final note, I'm no prude when it comes to reading good literature, but I thought the mass amount of vulgar language detracted from the story.  Because of this, I wouldn't recommend this book, but the story was okay.	2002-06-30

Lisa Smith wrote a tale of suspense, heartbreak, humor and love. The story kept you wanting to turn the pages, expecting an outcome of Jake and Tina finally getting it together. The surprise ending is what I really liked. Naturally, I'm a romantic and this is &quot;supposed&quot; to call for happy endings.  Smith knows how to do a story in style. She has great characters, well defined. She has wonderful dialogue and a great plot. For this first time author, I predict she will be writing another great novel in the near future.  Lisa Smith is well on her way to becoming another famous author.  Steel and Roberts may as well move over and get out of the way.  Lisa Smith has style, class and a &quot;gift&quot; for story telling.  I can't wait for her next book to be published.  I recommend this book to everyone.	2002-06-18

I started reading it on Friday evening and finished it on Saturday.  The book held my attention with the story's plot and I thought the flow went well.  Perhaps the characters were a bit shallow, but I can overlook that.  Since this is my first read for this author, I can't compare this book to her others.  However, this book has me interested enough to have me wanting to read more.  I think Scottoline has talent and she's putting it to good use.  There was only one little thing in the book that caught my attention and made me laugh.  That's when the author wrote that he cat Mel said meow.  Cat's don't say anything (or I've never met one that did) ;-)  I like this author's style. I recommend the book for an enjoyable read.	2002-06-08

I'm a romantic and I love reading short romance stories.  So I picked the book up while shopping the other day.  I read it last night.  I found the characters to be pretty much the usual, he's a doctor, she's an FBI agent.  But you have to allow for the fact that these people are the people who make interesting reading.  I enjoyed the jabbing and wit displayed in the the author's selected dialogue for her two main characters.  I think dialogue is a very important part of getting the story across.  In writing a quick read book, it's a must.  The story moved along at a nice flow, keeping me interested and wondering what next?  So why didn't I give it a higher rating?  I think it's because Graywolf and Special Agent Wakefield jumped into the sex scene too soon. Let's face it, only a couple of days had passed, if that, and here they were; having drinks, going to his apartment and having wild sex on the floor.  Too quick, I think. Aside from that, I did like the story, but found several flaws that a good editor would have picked up immediately.  Perhaps this took my attention too.  Just one mistaken word can change the structure of a whole sentence, like chance or change, and once I read it and start thinking about the word, then I lose track.  Otherwise, I'll have to admit I enjoyed Ferrarella's book.  I'll read some more of her work when I run across it again.	2002-06-07

Hanssen	Books	4	10	12	N	N	...an enlightening view of Hanssen	\\"Into The Mirror\\" is the first work written by Lawrence Schiller that I've read. Naturally, I was extremely interested in reading about Robert P Hanssen's life. After all, who wouldn't wonder what kind of a childhood or life Hanssen had lived before/during that of a turncoat spy? When Hanssen's story first broke in the news media, and his position with the FBI that had allowed for his twenty years of spying, I was quite appalled. Who wasn't? Still, like every other American, I soon developed my own opinion. I thought Hanssen spied for the money. After reading Schiller's book, my first impression was right. With his back financially against the wall, Hanssen found an easy way out of his problem. Yet, I kept wondering how this man could sleep at night for twenty years, knowing what he had done.  Not only had this traitor put the lives of every American in harm's way by divulging pertinent top-secret information to the Russians, but also the lives of his wife and six children. What a monster!  There's no doubt in my mind that Hanssen has to be one very sick and mentally deranged individual. He endured a childhood that was a nightmare. An abusive father who openly flaunted his womanizing in front of his wife and Robert. No doubt, dressed in his policeman's uniform, Hanssen's father considered himself another King Kong. The things Hanssen's father did to him were incomprehensible and unforgettable.  Yet Schiller showed in his research that Hanssen grew to manhood with a different outlook about life, marriage and raising children. The author is trying to convince his readers that Hanssen was unfaithful only once to his wife. That may be the case. Who oculd actually know for sure? But after reading the way Hanssen defiled Bonnie with his best friend, Jack, by showing Jack nude pictures of her and allowing Jack to observe what took place in the privacy of their bedroom...well, this is the part that proves Hanssen is mentally deranged. Perhaps he was trying to compare himself and his position to that of James Bond-Agent 007. The job put him above anyone or anything else. He too was another King Kong like his father, while toting his Walther PPK as an FBI agent. But instead of womanizing, which I would think he remembered his father here, he chose pornography. Everything Hanssen did in regard to sex was not normal. My only problem with this book was wondering if Schiller really did believe Hanssen's wife, Bonnie, was so gullible and naive. Surely he knows women better than that. If I found $10,000 in one of my husband's socks, I'd know something was going on. It's hard to beleive Hanssen succeeded for twenty years in giving his wife this kind of a snow job. Otherwise, I think Schiller has done a wonderful job in the research and portraying of Hanssen's life. I can't wait for the mini-series. I enjoy a book that keeps me wanting to turn the page. \\"Into The Mirrow\\" kept me turning its pages. I started reading and couldn't put the book down. I plan on recommending this book to my library book review group. And now, I'm going to the library and look for Schiller's book \\"American Tragedy\\".f and his position to that of James Bond-Agent 007. The job put him above anyone or anything else.

This is my third book written by Sparks to read. The other two being \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"A Walk To Remember\\".  Both were very good books and both were made into motion pictures.  I don't know if \\"The Notebook\\" has been made into a motion  picture, but if not, I think it should be.  I can just picture Paul Newman as the senior Noah, talking about his love for Allie.  I might add that I've donated four boxes of Kleen-X to Sparks' books, two boxes on \\"The Notebook\\".<BR>I'm a romantic.  I love to read romance.  And anyone who thinks romance is just for the young will have a change of heart after reading this novel.  Although \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"A Walk To Remember\\" were both sweet reads, this book by far was much sweeter.  Why?  Very simple.  Because it lasted through a lifetime.  In the beginning, I thought the book started slowely.  Too much detail for me.  And it was almost obvious Sparks was still a little \\"green\\".  However, I almost knew he wouldn't let me down.  So I read on.  The more I read, the better the writting and the story.  Sparks writes from the heart, and therefore, he manages to touch the heart of the reader.  Something any really good writer should thrive to learn.  His loves scenes describing the physical act of two people coming together as one is as well written and heart warming as any I've ever read.  I hate a love scene written in SMUT, and Sparks knows how to evade that all together.  This makes him special with his ability to let the reader know what the characters are feeling and still keep it beautiful.  That, my friend, takes talent.<BR>My hat is off to Sparks on this novel.  A wonderful read for anyone of any age.	2002-04-14

Other than I did purchase it.  I selected the novel among a stack of other books.  First time author for this type of fiction novel.  Sure, I'm interested. Let's see how well he writes.  But.. let's not kid ourselves.  The author had a cast of characters, a plot and everything needed for this novel. It wasn't a bad thing either. I read the book from start to finish and from what I can tell, Hutsko has the makings of a fine author.  It's obvious he's living in the age of computers and fast living.  My advice at this time to the observer of this review...go ahead and read Hutsko's novel, see what you think.  I liked it.  My advice to Joe Hutsko.... &quot;you go, Joe.&quot; ;-)	2002-03-25

Down with a the flu, I wasn't able to do anything but read.  I'd checked the book out of the library a few days earlier on a tip.  The book started out holding my interest and it held my interest.  I kept turning the pages to read what was going to happen next.  This is the goal of any author...keeping a reader's attention.  After I'd finished the book, I told myself I did enjoy the book, but honestly thought the book was a little too long.  I almost knew what was going to happen, or I guess I had the plot figured out before I got to the end of the book.  I like a story that keeps me guessing about whodunit...and this story didn't.  Baldacci is a mystery writer and although he injected a dab of romance, it was weak.  Naturally, if you have a beautiful woman and a FBI agent, you should have a touch of romance.  I think Baldacci had a good plot going, but I'll have to agree the coincidences in the timing of the events in LuAnn's life from start to end were a little far-fetched.  And I have a hard time believing a guy like Jackson could be so talented as to mimick voices and make someone believe he is a 10 year old girl.  Still, I'll give credit where credit is due.  The story kept me going and wanting to keep reading.  That's the name of the game with any writer.  So when I take this book back to the library, I'll check out another Baldacci book.  I'd recommend this book to anyone that likes mystery.	2002-03-23
US	52746777	RG6CXE94P0RXM	0743202961	243086094	Every Breath You Take: A True Story of Obsession, Revenge, and Murder	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Excellent read..highly recommended	Every Breath You Take, a true story written by Ann Rule is my first time read for anything written by this author.  I'll have to say I was highly impressed.  If I have trouble getting a book to grab my interest after the first or second chapter, then I don't go on with it.  The simple fact is I don't have the time to read books I don't enjoy.  I purchased the book and loaned it to a friend to read first because I was reading a novel and didn't intend to stop until it was finished.  My friend brought this book back to me a few days later and said she loved the story.  At first, I'll admit the family history did sort of distract me and made me wonder, but that soon passed and I think I did appreciate being able to connect who each character was or had been to Sheila and Allen.  After I'd finished reading the book, I had nothing but the highest praise for Ann Rule's research in writing this story.  True, there were a lot of questions I had to ask myself about Sheila.  It didn't take a mental giant to figure out that Allen was a demented sociopath.  It makes a person wonder what Sheila was thinking to stay with Allen after watching him deliberately kill the man and woman on the motorcycle.  That would have finished me off, if I hadn't already been gone after he'd bankrupted my parents.  She appeared so weak in the beginning and gradually gained insight and strength, only to turn around and do some really stupid things.  But the learning lesson she had taken before she finally left should have forewarned her that Allen was not a man to be reckoned with.  And still she persisted on dragging him back into court.  What kind of mother would have allowed him around her two daughters knowing he had sexually abused one of them?  I had a real problem with Sheila from the beginning, but at the end I realized no matter what her reasonings, she didn't deserve to die at the hand of some young punk that was killing her for the money.  The characters involved with Allen were of low-life and low intelligence caliber.  Sometimes it doesn't take a really smart person to be a superb athlete (look at Mike Tyson). Danny Rocha thought he was smart because he was good at golfing and winning thousands of dollars in betting with Allen. But he truly was a really stupid man.  Allen was baiting him to be used and he didn't have a clue.  I've worked for a short time in an abused women's center.  During that time, I've seen a great deal and can truly understand why women run for their lives from abusive husbands.  This is a very serious problem in our society today.  It isn't until after a person will finish reading a book like this one that they sit back and think \\"Oh, my heavens!\\"  Keep writing Ann Rule and I'll keep reading along with the rest of your fans.	2002-02-21

Another Beanblossom Special	Bryon's Corner is the second novel I've read by this author.  The heart wrenching story of two little girls abandoned by their mother is guaranteed to activate the tear ducts...at least it did mine.  The central figure is also the narrative voice in this fictional story telling of a mother leaving the girls a cold and heartless note to say she needed space to think things through.  How could anyone expect a child of ten years to understand a statement like that, much less deal with the fact her mother didn't want her any more?<BR>Dora Lee Kelleher and her younger sister were lucky to be blessed with wonderful grandparents like Clyde and Mae Bryon, who came to their rescue and adopted the two little girls shortly thereafter.<BR>A wonderful life on the farm still couldn't remove the heartache of missing her mother, or the memories of an abusive life with both parents.  To make matters even worse, Dora suffered great physical abuse by her father's hand just shortly after the adoption proceedings were finalized.  Being slammed against a car that would cause a deep head laceration and knocking out her teeth, Dora grew up with this memory of her father.  It wasn't the first time the child had suffered from her father's abuse. <BR>Grandpa Byron was a strict and righteous man who had failed with his own daughter and was hell bent not to fail with his two grand daughters.  After the adoption, he forbid any visitation rights to Dora's mother. He adored his two little girls.<BR>Living on the farm introduced Dora to her childhood sweetheart, who later turned out to be the love of her life, soul mate, best friend, and of course, her husband.  I would have to say Lee Becker was definitely my hero in this heartbreaking story.  For a woman to find such a man to love her as Lee loved Dora, she would have to know that God had truly given her the finest gift a woman could have...how very fortunate Dora was.<BR>Being reunited with her mother ten years later wasn't easy for Dora. Learning her mother had recently been treated for ovarian cancer, Dora has to make up her mind whether she can come to grips with forgetting the past and forgiving her mother; which is something her younger sister couldn't do.<BR>I think it was the ending of this story that really got to me, ...	2002-02-03

That was my major turn-off. I thought the dialogue set forth for the Behmini family was good. However, as this story commenced I was confused when the author switched back and forth on just whose house he was talking about.  I guess what I'm trying to say is I thought the story was difficult to follow in the beginning.  After I once discovered what the author was doing, it moved a little better.  Maybe I'm a little off base here, but for Mr. Behmini's family to start off living in such a high-rent apartment, picking up trash and working a second job at a convenience store probably wouldn't catch his monthly expenses in California. I found some parts of the story to be a little unrealistic. Then I found myself bored with too much description about the customs and ways of the Behmini family, the cooking, the previous life before coming to America.  I thought the author spent too much time in this area and wrote about things that really didn't pertain to the story. However, the character descriptions were good, even though they turned out to be very depressing .  The sex in this book I thought was described in a very crude way and was totally turned off in that area.  Last, but not least, I think a good editor could have done wonders for this book.  The punctuation was really lacking with sentences too long and running together.  I do think the author has talent in his story-telling ability, but feel he just needed to be a little more polished or fine-tuned with this novel.  This book has been selected for my next library book review group meeting and I can't wait to hear the opinions of the others.	2002-01-01

I was beginning to think it wasn't going to happen.  Of the past few books I've read that were published with Roberts name on the book cover, this book sounded more like the Nora Roberts that I first enjoyed reading.  Authors have things they say, expressions they hold, that stick with you.  This book reminded me of NR that way.  I didn't read the first book of this trilogy and now I'll have to do that.  Overall, I felt the plot was lacking, but you have to give Roberts credit about her research.  She's never lacking in that area when she writes about a certain subject.  I'll give her credit there.  I think Roberts can write romance like no other author I've read yet, but her plots and characters are starting to sound like replays, look like movie reruns and yeah, I've read about this rich person before. Some authors run the same character descriptions into the ground.  Still, I found this book to be so much more of a better read than I've had by Roberts of late, that I have to say I'm going to go out and purchase the first book of this trilogy, and I'll buy the third one too.  I have a bookcase full of Nora Roberts books and I'll add a few more.  At least I'm getting enthused again.	2001-12-25

She gave it back and said it wasn't up to snuff for a Nora Roberts book.  I didn't pick it up to read until after I'd finished Midnight Bayou.  I was not as disappointed with &quot;The Villa&quot;, but something has happened to this author.  Maybe she needs to take a break and concentrate on the story a little more.  When she first started writing, I would have classed Nora as one of the greatest in writing romance.  But of late, her stories are lacking in plot and character.  Neither really reachs out to grab you.  I doubt there's anyone that can write a love scene like Nora, that I've read anyway.  But she's just not thrilling me any more.  She used to have a certain style and she's lost that edge.  Maybe back then she was a lot more dedicated than she is now.  Who knows.  I just know she's capable of better work than the last two novels I've read.  It's like she throws a lot of words out on the page and they mean nothing.  In The Villa, there was way too much detail about making wine.  Who cares?  If I wanted a lesson in wine making, I'd go to the library and check out a book on wine making.  There wasn't a really neat love affair in this book either.  The characters were not people you could connect with.  Frankly, this book read almost like a Danielle Steel novel.  And who needs that?	2001-11-08
US	52746777	RR9MGSUSK0K2B	0399148248	358896248	Midnight Bayou	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Disappointing and predictable...	I wish I could sound as enthusiastic about Midnight Bayou as the editorial reviews, but this book let me down.  I've been one of NR's greatest fans to enjoy the first novels she wrote in the 80s.  I've always admired the woman's talent.  However, this book just simply left me feeling drugged out.  Declan Fitzgerald is the rich Boston lawyer who cancels his wedding three weeks before it is to occur, quits his legal profession and heads to New Orleans to renovate the Manet Hall he has purchased.  The story moves from renovating description, to flashbacks for the ghosts of Manet Hall, to Declan going to the bar where he's trying to make time with his neighbor's granddaughter, Angelina Simone.  He falls in love with Angelina, chases her until she can't resist him any longer and then they have great sex. Even the sex scenes which Roberts can usually shine at describing doesn't sound like her at all.  I think the fact Declan is supposed to be the reincarnation of Abigail from 100 years before just ruined his masculinity and turned me off.  There was no excitement in this story whatsoever. I personally thought the author lost sense of her Catholic upbringing when she had Angelina going to have dinner with Declan on Ash Wednesday to indulge in a steak dinner.  Eating steak on Ash Wednesday is a no-no. IF Roberts wrote this book, she should have gotten it right. Three characters, Declan, Angelina and Remy showed wit and humor. I liked their dialogue in the book and that's why I gave it three stars. I think this book makes about 164 novels published in about 20 years for Roberts and I'm beginning to have my thoughts about this too.	2001-10-24

I'll have to admit, I know talent when I see it.  Susan Phillips will be a great author of many more novels.  Although I only gave the review three stars, I agonized to give it four stars.  Maybe I shoudl have.  I loved Rachel's perservance and her wit.  I disliked Gabe Bonner from the start because of his reaction to a small child.  I enjoyed the story and how SEP tried to pull the plot together.  I simply found flaws in her writing that made me wonder how she got from one place to another.  For instance, we were talking about her deceased husband making off with millions of dollars and later, it turned out to be diamonds.  No where did I see how this happened.  I have a problem with the ending, where Rachel visits the child with leukemia.  Rachel had lost all faith and had not regained it.  And she is supposed to lay her hands on a dying child and make it well.  Okay, I have a problem with this, so I thought SEP could have changed her plot a little.  Overall, I like this author.  I think she has talent and I'm looking forward to reading more of her books.	2001-10-16

I really wanted to give the book five stars, and the only reason I didn't was because when I first started reading it, I had a hard time staying with it through the first few chapters.  Once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down.  I think perhaps Betty Smith was ahead of her time in her writing.  The book had mistakes, but they were few and far between.  I thought Smith did an excellent job of portraying her characters and I felt a warm connection to each one of them.  When Smith describes how the family lived in poverty and the buying coal for the stove, I remembered my own childhood and the hard times my own family had.  I recommend this book to anyone.  Francie will win your heart, your respect, your sympathy and well...there's not much more to say, I really loved the book.	2001-10-11

The book was recommended to me at my monthly book review group.  I was at the library so I checked out the book. The title of the book really took my eye because my son lives in Big Stone Gap on Shawnee Street.  I'm familiar with the town and the area so I knew Trigiani was describing everything perfectly.  Of course, she was writing fiction in the era of 1978, but nothing truly changes much in Big Stone Gap.  I found the story so very heartwarming that I plan to pick up Big Cherry Holler next.  Thumbs up to Trigiani, a very talented author.	2001-09-27

It certainly makes a person wonder when something like this happens.  Only a few days before I purchased this book, I had the distinct pleasure of talking to Terry Eaton, who just happens to be Evelyn Eaton's daughter.  Terry had called me to inquire about a writers workshop I was going to sponsor.  Because of the attack on the WTC, the workshop had to be cancelled, but I did talk to Terry a couple of times on the telephone.  During our first conversation, she told me she had written and published a book titled &quot;Joy Before Night&quot;.  Impressed with her conversation, I looked the book up on the Internet. We talked on the phone a few days later and I told her how nice I thought it was that she had written a book in honor of her mother.  Terry said she thought I might enjoy looking at some of her mother's work.  She hit the nail on the head.  I ordered &quot;I Send A Voice&quot; and after I finished reading it I ordered two more of Eaton's books.<BR>I was amazed by Eaton, who was born in 1902, being among the Indians in 1965 at the age of 63 and learning the spiritual teachings of her Indian ancestors.  Eaton's journey took her into many Sweat Lodge healing rituals, several Fasts, and even found herself worthy of having a Sacred Pipe.  After many years of being active in the Indian way of life, she fell into the political war of Indian against White Man.  Indians she had developed a friendship with came to resent her presence and shunned her.  Because she was a non-Indian and of white skin, she was no longer accepted.  It broke her heart but it didn't break her spirit.<BR>Eaton's last paragraph of her introduction to this book pretty well sums up the things she learned during her time spent with the Indians:  If we ask aright, with integrity and total committment, the way will be revealed, step by gentle step.  So it is for me, so it is for you, so it is for everyone.  <BR>I highly recommend this book.	2001-09-21

If there's anything that I can't stand, it's to read something that just doesn't hold my attention or is downright boring. And believe me, I've purchased a few books like that too. But (and Zinsser says it's okay to start a sentence with BUT), I caught a post on Writers Net that made mention of William Zinsser's book about writing nonfiction. I don't buy a book now without checking it out first. I'll have to admit that I was quite impressed with the reviews posted for Zinsser's book. I ordered it. I'm still patting myself on the back and wish I'd ordered the book three years ago when I first started writing. The first chapter in the book had me grinning from ear to ear. Thus,the first thing that came to my mind was &quot;the man's got style&quot;. By the time I'd finished reading this book, I knew the man had a lot more going for him than just style. Any writing instructor that manages to write a &quot;how to&quot; book, and still make the book an enjoyable read, definitely has my respect. But (I love this) more than being an enjoyable read, it was an informative read. I highlight important information of a instruction book in bright yellow. Zinsser's book looked like a coloring book on the inside after I'd finished reading it. I'll place this book on my desk for quick reference in the future. I recommend it to anyone who is just starting out or has already made it in the literary world. Zinsser gets my vote as one of the very best in giving good writing instructors.	2001-09-03

Imagination abounds in this suspense novel as the newcomer sets the stage for the plot in the prologue.  This novel grabbed me from the very beginning and kept me reading until I'd finished the book.  It's a given the author is developing a style of her very own.  <BR>It appears Nolan-Williams was blessed with some truly great friends at the Witchvox website who provided her with 1001 links for research and information.  I've noticed of late that several other authors have taken advantage of the information this website has to offer.  The extensive research in Shadows Within is evident, and the author doesn't fail to show gratitude to those who assisted in areas not just anyone could write about.  Nolan-Williams has my attention and I'll be watching for next book.	2001-09-03

I managed to get my hands on a copy of Giampapa's &quot;Cherish the Magic&quot;.  Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down, finished it in two days.  I'm a romantaic and really wasn't sure what to expect from this author at first.  Obviously a story based on the Viet Nam era, I expected a war story, but figured somewhere along the way, boy would meet girl, fall in love and come home from Nam a hero to live happily ever after.  Well, I have to admit, the hero's welcome home was indeed a happy ending, but it was nothing like I expected.  The relationship young Gianni Giancarlo developed as an Air Force Dog Handler with the German Shepherd, Shadrack, was as heart warming as any Rin Tin Tin movie I ever watched.  I would have to say, the author of this book put me right in the middle of the Viet Nam war, with both the Army and the Air Force.  Every move he made with the special trained Canine had me making the move with them.  His research into this book had to be extensive to describe the scenes so extensively.  The talent of this author is sharply displayed.  The missions of the search and rescue for downed Air Force pilots were truly amazing. For a writer to hold a woman's interest in a war story as this writer held mine, he has my utmost respect as a talented new big name author.  This book had me laughing, crying and mad when the story ended and I couldn't read any more. I'll keep watching for the name of Gioacchino Giampapa in hopes he's writing something else.  If he is, I'll be wanting to read the next piece of work this new talent gets put in print.	2001-08-19

I wouldn't choose a book like this to just sit down and read.  The book was picked for a book review from a local library group where I live.  I read the book in order to participate in the review. I am still wondering why a book written in 1993 is being picked for review instead of a book that has been newly published.  But, regardless, I've read the book now and I have my opinion like everyone else. It's obvious Sister Prejean is adamant in her drive to get the death penalty abolished. I'm certain as the spiritual advisor to these two death row prisioners, she became close to them.  Whether the things they said to her were true or not, all of it is now buried with them and only they knew at the time if they were sincere.  Life is precious and I agree with that.  These prisoners had no right to claim the lives of those young people.  I believe we are a product of our environment.  Husbands who beat their wives usually raise sons to do the same thing.  Still, no one has the right to take the life another unless in self-defense.  It is a blessing that lethal injection replaces the electric chair.  To kill in such an inhumane way is terrible.  I'm sure Sister Prejean witnessed some terrible scenes. I'm also sure there are flaws in the judical system and everything is political. She learned this early on. As a nun, she was expected to render her services as a spiritual advisor. She was also expected to show her heartfelt sympathy for the relatives of the victims.  She delayed in doing this which was a bit upsetting to me. To fight adamantly for what she believes in is admirable. She certainly did get their attention, but she isn't a one-person show.  I don't care for this type of literature, although I realize non-fiction sells.  There's enough sadness in the world without writing about it and describing it as Prejean did. But someone has to do it. As for the hereafter for these two now deceased killers, well, we all know about &quot;Judge ye not&quot;.  It's not my place to judge them or try to determine where their souls are headed.  I don't do that. No one remembers the names of the victims, but everyone remembers the names of the killers that the government puts to death. I wonder why that is.	2001-08-19

I do applaud Judith Barrington for the way in which she has shared her knowledge about writing non-fiction.  The book is very well written in format along with being easy to read.  Some of the &quot;how to&quot; books can turn a reader off if the author can't hold the reader's interest.  Believe me, this book will hold your interest.  I was very impressed with the detailed writing exercises included in each chapter.  The chapters on getting started, finding form, telling the truth, developing sensory detail, writing about living people and steering clear of common pitfalls were excellent.  Judith Barrington is to be commended for sharing a part of her personal heartache, as well as identifying herself to the reader.  After reading this book written by JB, I not only felt I knew more about writing non-fiction, I felt like I'd known the author for a long time.  I now plan to purchase her book &quot;Lifesaving: A Memoir.&quot;	2001-07-24

It's a short read, but full of humor.  I do have to recommend this book.  The author gives a lot of tips about the law that most of the general public aren't aware of.  He speaks generally for New Jersey, but it's pretty much true to form every where.  I hope to read more from Miczak in the future.	2001-07-04

Shortly thereafter, I loaned the book to a friend.  I realized after reading a few chapters the book was going to be very deep, and really thought the person I loaned it to wouldn't enjoy it at all.  I was wrong.  She returned the book and told me she loved it.  This inspired me to sit down with the book again and stay with it until I had finished it. I probably wouldn't advise anyone to read this book unless they did read it through.  The writing is good, but very deep and required your concentration into what the author was telling you.  I'm a collector of Will Rogers books and after reading this, I could almost understand why Will Rogers was the kind of person he portrayed.  Being of Cherokee decent myself, this brought my interest to this type of book.  I've been studying the history of the Cherokee tribe and I do believe reading Jamie Sams book has helped me a great deal.  This is not an ordinary book for someone just looking for a good read, but it is an excellent book on exactly what Ms. Sams has written about, Dancing the Dream....the seven sacred paths of human transformation.  I recommend this to anyone searching Native American culture. But more than that, I think the Cherokee people had much to tell us, and still do, if only we would read what they write and open our minds to what they say.  Jamie Sams has made a great contribution to our generation in the writing of this book.	2001-06-12

A few months ago and quite by chance, I ran onto this author/writing instructor in the strangest way.  I was surfing the Internet and happened to find this website for writers.  It's a very informative website with a little bit of everything for everyone in the literary world.  I clicked on the discussion board to see what was happening. I'm not one to join a discussion group because I don't have the time, but like I said, the website is full of writing information.  The discussion group actually has comments posted by published authors, giving helpful information to the fledgling writers.  In so doing, these published authors not only have my respect, they have my attention.  After reading some of the informative posts by Hal Bennett, I was impressed with what he had to say.  I sent him an e-mail conveying my compliments. Being a man of intelligence and good manners, Bennett thanked me via an e-mail, thus allowing me access to his website by his reply.  I think I would have eventually found it anyway, but it saved me a lot of time.  Bennett's book on &quot;Write From The Heart&quot; took my attention first and I ordered it.  Very impressive.  I concluded the man knew how to write a non-fiction book on the subject of writing. I rated him as being in the caliber of Brande, another great one. So, figuring he knew how to write non-fiction and hold my interest, I'd find out if he could write fiction and still hold my interest. I'm a romantic by nature, always have been, but I'll read anything that's well written, whether it's mystery, suspense, self-help, non-fiction, etc. For a long time, I've stuck with the really big name authors, but eventually I think we all  live and learn. I'm pretty gutsy and I'll venture spending the price of a book by any author who has my attention and interest. I don't know if you'd call it cheating when you open a book to the center or the end and read a few excerpts to determine whether it's a good book or not, but I'm famous for doing this. I DIDN'T DO THIS WITH &quot;SPIRIT CIRCLE&quot;. I started on page one and read through to the end.  I hardly put the book down until I finished reading it. The story was very different and touched me deeply. Bennett writes a book like I would venture to say he teaches writing, straight from his heart. The story plot, the characters, the vivid description of beautiful setting, his vast knowledge of Native American culture and last, but not least, the superb editing of this book, makes it an excellent read. Bennett is very gifted and well-educated, and quite obviously in good standing with his Muse.  I do highly recommend this book to anyone.	2001-06-10

The story was pretty much predictable and not all that exciting.  I found humor in one particular area when the author wrote the following lines:                                                           Her small blue makeup case was slung over her shoulder, and it bumped her rear end with each step, letting loose a musical tinkling of expensive bottles and bracelets. I'm trying to picture the small blue makeup case slung over a shoulder and bumping someone's rear end if the makeup case is small.  If the makeup case reached her rear end, the woman is either very shortwaisted or the makeup case is long and skinny.  I had to laugh. Overall, the book was well edited with no spelling errors.  The characters, although pretty much the usual in this type of story, were well developed.  My main problem with this story was the constant description of the clothing Lacy's stepdaughter, Gwen, was wearing.  I thought the author got a little carried away on this.  After the first few times, I had the general idea of what the girl's personality was like.  Since this is my first book to read by this author, I'd probably read another one if I had it.  The book is new out, being published in 2001.  That's a plus in its favor as far as I'm concerned.	2001-06-06

I checked the book out of the local library on the advice of a friend.  I had a hard time getting into the first four of five chapters and thought perhaps it wasn't going to be any good.  But my friend assured me that if I stayed with it, I'd become fixated with it.  He was right.  I couldn't put it down.  I could kick myself for not being aware it was a television movie and I missed it.  That's what I get for being a reader instead of a tv watcher.  I can only attest that if the movie was anywhere as good as the book, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Martini's style of writing is a little different and it took me a while to get used to it.  But once I finally was &quot;fixated&quot; on the story, then I didn't seem to notice it any longer.  Attorney Paul Madriani is truly the kind of attorney a client hopes to find for representation.  Martini proves his character to be full of intelligence and wit in a world where attorney's have to stay on their toes.  Only a master of story-telling could have written such a story, unless of course, Martini might be drawing on real life experiences.  I have already checked out another novel by Martini, The Attorney.  I can't wait to get started on it.	2001-05-27

I'm still wondering who came up with the title for this novel.  I've read several novels by this author, and after reading the last one, I sort of felt badly about how I'd thought her talent lacked a lot.  I figured I'd just picked up the wrong novels and was off to a bad start.  My first mistake here was buying another reprint.  My second mistake was reading this novel from the start to the finish.  After I closed the book and thought about the story, I started laughing.  I'm still laughing.  I can't believe I stayed with it and read the whole book in one sitting.  I thought several times that sooner or later the plot will improve and the story will get better.  Nope, it just didn't happen.  It makes me wonder sometimes how an author can write a book like this one and expect the public to swallow it.  Better yet, for a publisher to stick an author's name on a reprint and sell it.  Then I'm thinking, it's a reprint from 1983 and maybe this type of novel was considered good.  However, this is 2001 and no one would expect a business tycoon like Tyler Scott to behave with an employee in such a manner.  To tell an employee he planned to seduce her the next day after their first meeting would lay a man wide open for legal action under the sexual harassment act.  There was no leading up to a love affair.  It just started out with Tyler telling her his intentions and from there it was....well...it was YUCK.  I share books that I purchase with a reading buddy and I plan to give her the option about reading this book.  I wouldn't recommend it to her because I wouldn't want her to get the idea I enjoyed any part of it.  If she didn't already know I had it, I wouldn't tell her about it at all.  With that, I think I've made my point.	2001-05-23

It wasn't that I was thrilled with the story, because I thought the story was &quot;lackluster&quot; in that it didn't have any parts that really showed any kind of emotion.  Even when Emily was trying to show fear, you didn't feel it.  I like a book that makes me at least grin, if not laugh out loud, or likewise, can make me cry or feel the fear or emotion trying to be described.  MHC didn't do this with her latest novel.  I have a hard time wondering how this book climbed to No. 1 spot on the charts.  HOWEVER, I will say the one reason I did keep reading the book was because of all the potential killers, I really couldn't make up my mind which character I thought was the killer.  And in the end, I truly was surprised at who the killer turned out to be.  That part I did like about the book.  I might add this too, I think MHC stepped out of her bounds with plot about reincarnation.  She should stick to something she knows more about when writing murder mysteries or suspense.  I've always hailed the lady as having talent, like many published authors, sometimes she displays it and sometimes she doesn't.  The book was loaned to me to read by a friend.  I didn't buy it.	2001-05-16

Bennett states it very plainly, or at least to me, that a writer should learn to tap into their mind, via their heart, to find there within the inner peace we all search for.  By acquiring the calm and inner peace in the mind, the heart will do the rest, telling the mind what to say.  A writer shouldn't have to struggle if they can only learn to attain an inner peace and listen to their heart.       Bennett tells that writing about what we know best, and drawing from our own life experiences, is an excellent place to start.  He has learned this and gains tremendous recognition through his published writings and workshops.  I have always believed that every writer has their own personal muse, whether they know it or not.  Bennett holds the same belief.  I personally feel that new writers should not confuse a Guide with a Muse, but I do believe writers can draw inspiration from either or both.      Good writers, allowing for good plot, great characters, and the ability to put words down correctly on paper (proper editing) can get published.  Knowing how to write from the heart isn't about learning how to get published (although Bennett's book does hold some good information here), it's about learning to write period.  For me, I find it is sort of like Lance Armstrong's &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;, only with Bennett, &quot;it's not about the book&quot;.  It's about the person within to assist the work and to overcome the obstacles.      I consider myself to be very lucky because I think I understand what Bennett is talking about in &quot;Write From The Heart&quot;.  I'd wager there isn't a person, who has had the privilege of attending one of Bennett's workshop, that came out of it without understanding.      To any person who is thinking of writing a book, I strongly recommend getting a copy of &quot;Write From the Heart&quot; and reading it first.  The quotes, the core concepts, and the writing explorations at the end of each chapter are excellent.      I'm placing Bennett's book next to Strunk &amp; White's &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; on my desk.  Do yourself a favor and read Hal Zina Bennett's book, then go ahead and unleash the power of your creativity.	2001-04-26

As with Sandra Brown, the publishers are reprinting the older novels of their best sellers.  That's not a problem in Roberts case though, because her first published books to my way of thinking were her best.  When she started writing, she had style.  Maybe I think she even had class which set her apart and aside from most other writers.  And I think this is what made her so great to start with.  Too bad she's changed.   I guess when you get to be so famous it doesn't matter what kind of story you write, the author's name will sell it.  I do admire the lady with the utmost respect.  I think The Last Honest Woman was written with a lot of theme from her own personal life, including the two little boys and location. (Just my own personal opinion)  The romance is a heartwarming, tearjerker that has a happy ending, as the industry seems to think all romance stories should have.  I read the story and felt the emotion.  Abby, the middle of the triplets, was a strong and self-willed woman.  Dylan was the knight in shining armour coming to save his princess.  She writes romance in the early years quite well and this story proves it.	2001-04-12

We went from his sudden appearance at the birthday party she was giving for a big shot (and after being separated for seven months) to his attempted reconciliation, all the way through the book.  Her flash backs of how they met and married were cute.  The story was almost typical Brown.  First they were lovers, then married, then separated for along time and back together again for a happy ending.  It's hard to imagine Riley calling someone Dim Whit and they would adore him.  I thought the story had zero plot and not one character really grabs you. Maybe because there aren't many characters except Riley and Brin.  This one was published in 1985 and is a reprint.  It isn't new writing by Brown.  Brown can write nice descriptive love scenes, but the overall story lacks suspense.  It doesn't keep you enthused about turning the page because there was no doubt about what would happen at the end.  I read the story in one evening.  This is my third or fourth book by this author and I'm still not excited.	2001-01-21

Although I would have to say I found the author's style of writing in this particular book on the humorous side, it wasn't romance in the usual manner.  I doubt any man in his right man would want to depend on a woman for physical protection, although I know there are women who are capable.  We're talking how this made Nick look to the female fans of Andersen(at least for me). She made him him look like a wimp right off the bat, which was a turnoff for me to start with.  They were jumping into sex too often and  didn't leave room for much of a story plot. Everyone likes sex in a romance novel, but this one went to extremes. About the only thing that seemed to be realistic in this novel was the politican, J. Fitzgerald, and his behavior. I didn't care for the plot, but I found the book to be an amusing read and found myself laughing at times. I think the author has talent with words so I'll probably read some more of her work.	2001-01-09

I can't seem to learn my lesson on reading Sandra Brown's reprints and my disappointment hasn't changed any. I give any book the benefit of a doubt and thought this one might have some potential when it started out, but the more I read the worse it became. I know Brown has written several books and probably has put out some good reading material, and I probably just haven't found the right book by her yet. This story I thought turned out to be a little far-fetched. I thought the story made Dani look almost simple. She returns to a high school class reunion to try and acquire a small piece of property for a summer camp for handicapped children. The property just happens to be owned by her first love, whom she married and on her wedding night her parents took her away and had the marriage annulled. Trying to bargain her body for the property in return for a wedding night with her that he never had the opportunity to share, then he held off so long in doing the only thing he really wanted to do, well it just was all a little too &quot;far-fetched&quot;.	2000-12-26

I read the book in two days, starting late one evening and finishing it early the next morning.  I gave the book a high score because I love a book that makes me want to keep turning the pages to see what happens.  I thought the plot was good. I understood how Nick could acquire his attitude toward women because of his mother, but I kept wondering how long it would take Lauren to get to him.  McNaught took time to develop her characters and made you see them as I think she did and wanted you to.  I enjoy a good romance and McNaught delivered one in Double Standards.  I'll be ready to read another one of her books the next time I get a chance.	2000-12-26

It was written in 1984 and probably when she first started writing.  That's my guess anyway after reading the book.  I suppose after so many years the authors/publishers think they can bring these older books out of the closet and reprint them, and then because of the author's name the younger readers will grab them up.  It must work, I see a lot of it.  But Brown would have been better off to left this one on the shelf. Because I finish a book when I start it, I read it all.  I purchased it because of her name, but I think I've learned my lesson on reprints.  Need I say more?	2000-12-03

After I read the book, I reserved my comments until after I loaned it to my mother-in-law.  Then I loaned it to my daughter-in-law, who is an avid reader of everything. Because this was the first time I had read anything by MHC and because she is so well thought of, I was curious as to what both women would say. They said exactly what I thought they would.  It was an average read, nothing really exciting. I felt better about my opinion then.  This book never did grab me like I thought it would.  I didn't bond with any of the characters and wondered where the author came up with such a lame plot. Maybe I just expected too much.  I own the book and it's now part of my library, but I'll hold off buying another MHC book until someone else reads it first. If I start reading a book and can't put it down, it is an excellent read.  It took me about a week to read this one because I just had other things I'd rather be doing. It's an average book, at best.	2000-12-03

Once I get into reading a book, I have a hard time putting it down.  I kept waiting for something to move me in these two novels, but it didn't.  This is a reprint, so I'm wondering if maybe the first edition didn't do too well.  I think maybe I'm just disillusioned with Nora Roberts now.  I recently read where she has written 135 novels under the names of Nora Roberts and J.D. Robb.  To write 135 novels in the span of approximately 20 years is really something.  I've read some excellent books with her name on them, but this isn't an excellent read.  I gave it a three, because I'm a romantic and the book does have romance.	2000-11-29

Haddam starts out with a 48 page prologue that describes nine of the characters that are supposed to come into play in the plot.  She jumps around in the story, going back and forth to the oversized Evelyn Bracken and her eating habits and a husband who detests her oversized body.  Then she jumps into a land deal where Sara Lockwood and her husband are trying to swindle people on a land deal.  All the while, still trying to make this book a murder mystery and mixed with a wedding to boot.  I will have to say that the plot could have been a good one and had potential, had she not ruined it with all the other characters. I was surprised in the end and I liked that. Haddam has talent and imagination, she just needs to stick to her story and not use so many characters that shouldn't be part of it.  This is the first book I've read by Jane Haddam, but this book wouldn't stop me from reading another one by her.	2000-11-29

I read half of it on Friday afternoon, then finished it Saturday night before going to bed.  I would have to say that Sparks did do his homework when he wrote about the speech problems of the little boy, Kyle.  It's always good to know that a writer does his reseach well.  I kept reading the book until it was finished because I wanted to see what Taylor McAden's problem was.  I think I almost had it all figured out from the start, but I never second guess the plot of a writer's novel. I read it through and then make up my mind about the story.  I've read better books than &quot;The Rescue&quot;, but I have read a lot worse.  I think Sparks is talented and I will probably read his next novel.  One thing we don't have to second guess about Sparks, he's writing his novels himself and not spitting out ten or twelve novels a year, like some authors claim to be doing.	2000-10-09

And I would have to say, most of the books that I have purchased I did find  useful in assisting me with what I wanted to know. But after reading  Dorothea Brande's &quot;Becoming a Writer&quot;, I felt the warmest type of  inspiration. Brande came from the 30s era when she didn't have to contend  with the computer, editors that only read two or three pages of a book  before they throw it in the trash pile, or the pressures of a fast moving  market. Yet, she knew full well what every writer experiences and needs to  be told. And she told it, quite well, in this book. I loved it. I keep it  next to my computer for reference from time to time. I recommend this  wonderful book to anyone that has intentions of writing, no matter what  area they are trying to enter.  It is just great.	2000-08-16

I purchased &quot;Winter Solstice&quot; last week and didn't start reading it until late Sunday afternoon. I was anxious to get started after noticing  it was rated in the publisher's weekly No. 1 spot and I had never read any  of Pelcher's work before.     I found, as I read the book in less than two  days, that Pilcher is very good at getting a reader to visualize these  things: the weather, what her characters are wearing, they drank too much  tea, what type of food they ate, the scenery, and last, but not least, the  snow.     I also found the book to be a complete disappointment. I  concluded Pilcher was indeed probably suffering from writer's block while  writing this novel and she just started throwing words out on a page to  fill it up. What I certainly did not find was a book I would class as a No.  1 best selling novel. It makes me wonder if the people who rate these books  actually read them. If she acquired this top rating from her fans buying  the book, then I'll bet she has a lot of disappointed fans after they read  it. I tend to notice now that publishers push the big name authors into the  top ten list and I now feel it is because of the author's name, not about  the book being an excellent read. It's power of suggestion to get you to  buy and I guess it works for them.     I'm surprised that Pelcher put out a  piece of work like this and expects her fans to be enthused after reading  it. Even if she had a good story, she would have ruined it with her  continuous use of describing the weather, what her characters were wearing,  drinking too much tea, and her winter wonderland description of snow.  Several times while reading the novel I opened the curtain to see if there  was snow and went to relieve my bladder from all the tea drinking I was  reading about.     Pelcher showed she wasn't focused on pg.352 when she  described two boxes of glassware she was borrowing as &quot;not heavy, just  awkward&quot; and then a few pages later, on pg.363, poor Oscar retrieves  the same two boxes and they are &quot;unwieldy and heavy&quot;. I noticed  this. As I also noticed on pg.355 she actually describes what Oscar is  wearing at the funeral of his wife and daughter. Who cares he is &quot;in  his good black overcoat, standing in the front pew.&quot; And trying to  convince her readers in this sad story that Oscar found total happiness  just two months after the tragic loss of his wife and daughter. It showed  very little, if any, grieving took place.     I do believe Pelcher is  capable of talent in writing, she just didn't display in in this book. At  least, not to me.	2000-08-16

I've watched her on television and was never turned on with her. But the book was heartwarming and certainly told you where her priorities were in life.  Being born with a &quot;silver spoon&quot; in her mouth certainly has  allowed her the crutch needed not to have to worry about where her next  meal would be coming from. She openly admits to that in the book. But she  comes across that even if she had not been born into a famous family and  wealth, she would still have taken the same approach. She knew what she  wanted and she went for it. And apparently she took a few knocks along the  way. I found the book to be inspiring. I'm glad I have it. I'll probably  refer back to it from time to time. I'm also happy she didn't let her  employer talk her into cutting or dying her hair. It's a trade mark for her  and that's the first thing they want to do,  make a person over physically.  I have a different opinion of her after reading this book.	2000-06-18

I couldn't wait for this one to come out. I read it in two days and although it was a good read, it wasn't one of her best, I  didn't think. Who know, maybe she is cranking them out too fast. I'll stay  with her and anxiously await her next one. They can't all be perfect, but  she comes close.	2000-03-27

I read the book in two days because I could not put it down until it was finished. Beanblossom is a new author with a world of talent. Her story of Abigail  Hoffman's heartaches and happiness in her young life and world will touch  your heart to the very core. Anyone who reads this book and doesn't think  it one of the best, doesn't know much about life. I hail this lady and her  writing abililty. I can't wait for her next book to come out.	2000-02-14

The lady just keeps you wanting to read more and more. Where she gets her wealth of information is a wonder, but she certainly does a fine job. I have yet to read one of her books that I  haven't loved. This one fell right in line. If the writer doesn't cry, the  reader probably won't either. I wonder if these books get to her in that  way. I hope she never quits. I will pass this book on to my reading  friends.	2000-01-27

I think the lady has a lot of talent and I like reading her books. This one was probably a little far out, but when reading a book a person needs to remember it is just a story. I don't think  this book cramped her style any and I'll read whatever she writes again.  I'll share the book with my reading friends.	1999-12-01

I would have to say I do believe Danielle Steel was not using much of an imagination while writing this one, if she did. I thought there was a lot of verbiage going on here that was  not her style. The plot was pitiful, if there was one. I purchased the book  and wish I had my money back. I do not recommend it to anyone.	1999-11-28

When I started reading it, I found I could not put it down. Tami Hoag took me into the world of Cajun Country. Women dream of finding a man like Lucky. Tami Hoag makes that  dream come true, just reading the book. I'm a Tami Hoag fan. She knows her  romance. I try to read all of her books.	1999-08-21
