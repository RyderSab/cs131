His daily strips were a mix of grim cynicism and playful melancholy, offering both commentary about the often absurd nature of the adult world and old-fashioned childlike fun, while his Sundays were flights of adventure and experimentation, places where he boldly played with color and layout and design. <br /> <br />Bill Watterson went out on top because he believed in his ideals. And I respect that. <br /> <br />With this collection, you get to see it ALL. Every last bit, plus plenty of extras. And $100 price tag or not, it's worth every penny and then some. <br /> <br />It really does not get any better than this set. It's just a superb in every way. A loving chunk of craftsmanship went into this release. The colors jump off the page, the books are of very high quality, and the extras include, well, pretty much EVERYTHING. All the added bits from collections of the past, including covers? It's all there. Plus, you know, 10 years of the most brilliant comic strip ever created. The thing is a monster. I got a workout just walking around the store with it.  <br /> <br />There could be no more comprehensive Calvin & Hobbes collection than this. Gorgeous packaging, layout, presentation, quality ... it's just a first-rate product from the word go. <br /> <br />This is a must have for any and all comic strip fans.	2005-10-05

Not a true trilogy - the books are related by theme, not story - this book  deals with many of the same issues as Valis; god, divinity, faith, belief, and free will. <br /> <br />I confess that The Divine Invasion did not at first click with me the way most of Dick's books do. It was only when what is being dealt with finally revealed itself that I  found myself drawn in - yet even then, this did not rise to my list of favorites by this master writer. The gist is this: God left the Earth thousands of years ago because Jesus did not work out as He planned; He holed himself up on some far flung planet; now the Second Coming has arrived, and the new messiah is going to be birthed by a human colonist and brought to Earth. The catch? A police state has long been on the watch for his coming, hoping to prevent it. <br /> <br />The subject matter is fantastic, but the left turns and reality-changing (not unlike Lies, Inc., aka The Unteleported Man) were often disconcerting. That's usually fine if you're reading over the course of just a few days, but since I stretched this one out over more than a week, keeping my head in Dick's shifting realities and whirling viewpoints was at times more a chore than a joy. That's more a reflection of how I read the book (and how long it took me) rather than the book itself, however, because the ideas are very strong. I'm  confident that if given a fresh read over a shorter span a better novel will reveal itself. Whether \\"better\\" means \\"great\\", of course, is debatable. <br /> <br />This book was written in Dick's last years, which were very introspective and wrapped up in religion and philosophy. The Divine Invasion is no different in that regard. If that's the PKD angle you're looking for, well, here it is.	2005-10-01

Dick, I'm well aware that his work can sometimes go off the deep end, plunging into insanity, oddness, and assorted strangeness. I'm used to that. <br /> <br />Yet Valis is the most obtuse Dick I've read to date yet. Very difficult to pin down, and very autobiographical (the author went somewhat insane in real life and thought God spoke to him through a pink laser), the first portions of this book are utterly DENSE with philosophical ramblings and viewpoint switches. It takes its sweet time settling into an actual story. <br /> <br />It's also something of a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Valis, despite my early concerns when I first read it, ended up being pretty much excellent. It's about madness, the search for god, religion and faith, insanity, loss, death, and coping with pain. There are layers here just asking to be peeled back and examined. Very autobiographical, which makes this all the more powerful if you're aware of PKDick's history. This is a book that is both baffling and wonderful, one of the most confused and  interesting Philip K. Dick's I've read to date. <br /> <br />If you're new to his work you may want to tackle something a little more accessible first - maybe The Man Who Japed, or Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep - but if you're comfortable with his style and haven't tackled this yet, be prepared for a heady, dense, thought-provoking ride.	2005-10-01

It's the fiction that got me back on a fiction kick. Plenty of fresh, new ideas, a compelling story and an evocative new world to explore. It's a nice mesh of steampunk, horror, fantasy and thriller with largely superb (though occasionally loquacious) writing. <br /> <br />Mieville creates a truly compelling, twisted world that lives and breathes in a way few fictional worlds do. It's dirty and gritty and crawling with the stuff of nightmares. The story is a slow burner that takes hundreds of pages to reveal itself, yet it does not suffer for the pace. The slow pacing (until the latter third, at least) works in its favor. It's a tome full of IDEAS (some more plausible than others), and presented with plenty of style. Mieville is likely to be successful for some time. <br /> <br />None of this means the book is without flaws, of course. Without question, Perdido Street Station left an impact on me right away - though I confess that impact faded a bit with time. Where once I thought this a five-star book, I now consider it a (very worthy) four-star book, largely because in retrospect its flaws have become more apparent. Namely, Mieville is in love with ten-dollar words but hasn't the restraint to use them sparingly, and the resolution to the central conflict is rather ordinary when contrasted to the rest of the book. Worse still, there is a HUGE deus ex machina at the end that really grates. <br /> <br />That doesn't mean this isn't recommended. It is. No doubt. The strength of  Mieville's vision and the richness of his world is a wonderful thing to behold.	2005-10-01

I just wish it had lived up to the expectations set by the great idea Wilson put forth. <br /> <br />Like the other Wilson book I read, \\"Darwinia,\\" the concept of \\"The Chronoliths\\" is great but the execution is somewhat lacking. We're giving this totally engaging and thought-provoking mystery, and Wilson hints at big revelations to come, but we never actually GET those revelations. (We got them in Darwinia ... they were just a tad awkward). Good characters with well-drawn interpersonal relationships and a fairly satisfying ending make this a worthy read, but the whole draw for me was the mystery behind the chronoliths ... and that mystery goes unsolved. <br /> <br />None of this discourages me from Wilson's work, though. His ideas are strong enough and his writing good enough (especially his characters) that I am confident he has at least one science fiction masterpiece in him.	2005-10-01

Some good pieces in here that offer nice anecdotes and wisdom, and a LOT of worthless filler that offers pretty much nothing. Doesn't offer near the level of insight I had hoped for and expected, and was even pretty boring for gossip. With the exception of six or seven excellent essay, it's a bunch of writers who repeat the same story over and over again: \\"I used to not get a lot of writing work, then a friend helped get me a job, and now I write a lot.\\" <br /> <br />Yawn.

More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.  <br /> <br />Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never there <br /> <br />Mandatory reading.	2005-10-01

Place him in the midst of a conflict in its final days. Stir generously with passable writing ability.  <br /> <br />What you get is Another River, Another Town : A Teenage Tank Gunner Comes of Age in Combat-1945.  <br /> <br />This is something different in the way of soldiers telling their tale. Here's a guy who got into the war when it was practically over, during the final few months of the European campaign, all post-Bulge. And he's a tank gunner. Most books of this sort are from the perspective of the grunt, and usually from guys who saw more \\"action\\" (which is not to say the author did not - his life was in grave danger on a number of occasions). <br /> <br />With Another River, Another Towns we get some insight into the mind of a soldier and a good glimpse at the life of a tank gunner during the last days of World War II, when the European Theater saw more surrendering and looting than actual combat. This isn't a \\"becoming buddies in the foxhole\\" book ... but it did have some merits, primarily in that it looked at a period of the war usually glossed over fairly quickly. Once you get past the Africa campaign, Sicily, D-Day and the Bulge, the European conflict becomes much less \\"sexy\\" from the American perspective. This book fills in some of those gaps and shows us what the soldiers experienced during this late period in the way. <br /> <br />It was not a melodramatic or sepia-toned book, which is a positive, and offered a glimpse into an aspect of World War II not often explored - the mass surrendering at the tail end of the conflict, and how the Army often did not want to deal with prisoners of war because they only served to slow down the advance. German soldiers intent on surrendering were often turned away. <br /> <br />Nothing here is vital reading, even for the WWII buff - it's a pretty typical soldier's tale, told simply - but I really enjoyed this glimpse into the world of the tank gunner and would certainly recommend this for a good Saturday read on the war. It had a lot of heart.	2005-10-01

Dick (most are), in some ways because it doesn't feel quite like most of his other work. This one felt more like an episode of The Twilight Zone than the heady science fiction he is known for. Children with strange powers, things not being as they seem (a frequent Dick theme), and a strange mystery that unfolds into something large beyond scope (again, a frequent theme), as god clashes against god. <br /> <br />The story opens with the main character, Ted Barton, visiting the town he grew up in. Only now ... it's different. Something is wrong. He finds that he NEVER EXISTED in this town's history. Things only get stranger from there. <br /> <br />The Cosmic Puppets leaves you with as many questions as it does answers, but was a very satisfying read. The situation Dick creates is engrossing and fascinating, and the pacing is lightning quick. Probably among the most accessible PKDick books I've read to date, perfect for a casual fan or someone new to this man's startling body of work, The Cosmic Puppets comes highly recommended.	2005-10-01

He has great concepts and builds upon the tremendous mysteries  in space like a master of the art, but he too often relies on rescues and cliffhangers,  dragging out  tension for far too long. <br /> <br />Chindi was full of great ideas and situations and concepts; really great science fiction in every way. I loved the tantalizing hints he lays before the reader of larger alien cultures now long since lost to time. As was the case with the last two McDevitt's I read, halfway through the book I'm thinking it's one of the best SFs I've read in recent memory. But the latter fifth of the book falters. And with the same flaw other McDevitt's suffer from. The big mystery is revealed, only to have more mysteries revealed (which is maddening but very cool and effective, as with Clarke's Rama). The flaw is that the final stretch of 40-50 pages is just a long rescue sequence. Not necessary. Not effective. Just Another McDevitt Rescue. This book would have been better - vastly better - had it been cut out. <br /> <br />McDevitt is already one of the most enjoyable genre writers out there. When he finally lets go of his love for tension-filled rescue after tension-filled rescue - they lose their novelty when there are four to five in every book, each time killing off a character or three - he's going to be one of the best idea men in the business. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, so should you read this? Yes. Yes you should. Because anti-climactic, unnecessary ending aside, the ideas and glimpses of lost alien cultures are fantastic.	2005-10-01

It was with the aid of these \\"spacemen\\", or at their behest, that ancient monuments like the pyramids and the Nazca lines were created. Encounters with this alien race, which Von Daniken argues interbred with mankind thousands of years ago, led to tales of \\"gods\\" that would become the religions of the world. <br /> <br />It's an interesting enough premise that must have seemed pretty fresh when this was published in 1969, but the author is too married to his theory. He GUSHES when he writes. His whole argument tends to circle around variations of, \\"We're not sure how the pyramids were built, so why couldn't spacemen have done it? If the world's religions have so many themes and images in common, like the flood, couldn't it have been aliens?\\" He discounts entirely the idea that these ancients cultures were capable of huge tasks, such as creating the Easter Island monuments. <br /> <br />Entertaining, but ultimately not very convincing.	2005-10-01

Lots of medical jargon  and plenty of charts, yet very quick reading. How a book manages to both be light reading and bogged down with terms better left to bio experts, I don't know. But this manages it. <br /> <br />Oh. And it was an enjoyable read, too. <br /> <br />I had never read anything by Michael Crichton before and found this to be a real page-turner in every way. It read very fast despite Crichton's always obvious desire to show you the science behind his story. Good premise - a bacteria scooped out of the upper atmosphere kills a small town of 48 people in Arizona, prompting a (top secret) government panic before the bacteria spreads - that works really well (though it suffers from a  poor, too-easy ending). Enjoyable enough so that I might finally go ahead and read Jurassic Park (or Timeline, which I own but have never read), because Crichton shows that he's very, very capable of piling on the tension and keeping those pages turning. <br /> <br />If you haven't read Crichton before, seems like this is as good a place to start as any.	2005-10-01

Ruthlessly graphics, often funny, and always engaging, it's a must read for me whenever a new trade paperback is released. <br /> <br />Forever is nice installment of the Powers series, adding the overall mythos these creators have built. Forever is a story arc that reveals who the main character, Christian Walker, truly is, while outlining a superhero rivalry that has gone on, well, forever. It does not rise to the level of the last tome, The Sellouts, but it does manage to be a good story of revenge and loss, adding new layers to an already great series. Recommended.	2005-10-01

It's packed with good information, enlightening the reader on the dozens of issues involved in making a film that most of us never even think about. For that, it's worth reading - but not for the writing itself, which is very dry and not all that engaging. <br /> <br />The information was sometimes enlightening and eye-opening, and the reading brisk and easy, but it completely lacked depth and did little to touch on the ART of the producer. The book's message can be summed up as follows: \\"Hire a bunch of good people and stay out of the way. Oh, and make sure they stay under budget.\\" <br /> <br />Not a bad book by any measure, but it's very textbook-like in nature. If that's what you want, a big thumbs up. Otherwise, grab this only if you spot a good deal.	2005-10-01

At its core, it's an overview of key moments in the history of film, with major milestones covered in 4- to 10-page chapters. It reads briskly and it structured well. <br /> <br />Because of all that, it SHOULD be a good read. But it's ... well, just okay. The author relies too much on the words of others, brings none of his own flair to the writing. Plenty of quotes and opinions from others in the field, little in the way of new insights or viewpoints. I have read webpages with better assessments of various eras in film. <br /> <br />This makes this a non-essential for folks who already known their film, but that doesn't mean this doesn't have value for a film student or someone new to film. The book does offer a nice look at various periods in film history, and the chapters on key film movements were well done, inspiring me to watch some stuff I may not have otherwise seen. <br /> <br />Can't give it the highest recommendation possible, but you won't hate yourself for owning this.	2005-10-01

In The Engines Of God, Jack McDevitt creates some really nice mysteries around alien archeology, plunging the reader into a tale of galactic exploration and the hidden secrets of an alien past. It's a great thrill ride with just one major flaw: He probably used the Tension Filled Sequence too often. There were four such major sections here, two too many. Nonetheless, a very enjoyable book that is highly recommended to fans of Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous With Rama. <br /> <br />Since reading this, I have become a very strong Jack McDevitt fan. Reading several of his books in a row reveals his reliance on certain formulas ... but darn it, he utilizes those formulas very well! McDevitt never fails to provide drama, suspense and thrills, all while showing us the hidden wonders of the universe.	2005-10-01

That very much works in its favor. While other bios have often focused on the \\"dark\\" side of the Master of Suspense, painting a portrait of a disturbed man, McGilligan's work is more measured. We see the darkness, but we also see the light. There are some \\"tell all\\" moments that show Hitchcock's strange/dark side, but they don't come across as too gossipy. <br /> <br />The pacing is a bit off - the initial chapters, for instance, spend far too much time dealing with a handful of short stories he wrote for publication prior to his film career - but the writing is good, and more detail is gone into on the state of Hitchcock's life during each individual film than any other bio. It's a really strong look into his life AND his films. <br /> <br />For film lovers, the looks at how Hitch handled direction and his inventiveness are especially a joy to read. You get a very strong insight into how the master worked, which made me appreciate his films all the more. <br /> <br />This bio is very long, but also very comprehensive. Highly reocmmended.	2005-10-01

The story picks up at the end of that era. A small group of \\"people\\", sheltered for thousands of years, exit their shelter at the end of the ice age to create a new world.<br /><br />Sounds great, but things really ground to a halt about 200 pages in. Is this a soap opera? A philosophical exploration? A \\"lost civilization\\" story? An adventure? The book is not sure. Had it chosen its course and stayed there, I would have loved the ride. Instead, I found myself wanting more from this book.<br /><br />Silverberg's premise is good enough, but the story didn't feel as if it actually went anywhere. Excellent and well done characters, good world-building, but no sense of urgency or movement to the story. Silverberg plays with some philosophical concepts, but he just doesn't do it very well. And the end was very anti-climactic and unsatisfactory. After reading several good Silverberg's, he may have just handed me my first dud (or semi-dud; the writing was very strong) in a long streak of pretty enjoyable books.<br /><br />I wanted to like this. I really did. The characters and concepts were simply brilliant; the world building fantastic. But in the end it was just, \\"eh.\\"	2005-10-01

Chaos ensues, governments fall, militant women go nuts, doomsday religions pop up, and on and on and on. It's a nice twist on a done-to-death (no pun intended) concept, this time in comic form. <br /> <br />This installment, Safeword, is a little weak in its first half (though it does contain some nice revelations about the title character), but plunges into a very good second half that again pushes the main story forward. This story arc did not leave me floored like the last arc did, but it certainly had me eager to continue with this great series.

My fear was not founded. Ursula Le Guin did not disappoint with The Telling. Nor has she lost her touch. Her mastery of the language is stronger than ever, and her ability to tackle subjects like sexuality, freedom of thought, and religion is as strong as it was on books like The Left Hand Of Darkness. <br /> <br />The Telling shows her in fine form. The writing is poetic and wonderful, the world she creates believable, and the social commentary never heavy-handed. This book is a treatise on religion and government oppression, and on humanity's perseverance in the face of intolerance, as well as on Le Guin's own notion of a \\"perfect\\" religion. <br /> <br />There's not a lot of forward motion here, but that doesn't work against it.  Sure, it may be painfully slow for some people - there is nary a gunshot, chase, explosion or fight in the entire book - but sinking into what the Telling is makes for good reading, and the character development in the last fourth of the book is excellent. It doesn't have \\"action,\\" but the pacing is perfect. <br /> <br />This book is a companion book to her Hainish novels, which includes the legendary The Left Hand Of Darkness. Not a sequel, really, the Hainish books aren't series as much as books with thematic convergence, dealing with differing cultures, sexuality, and interpersonal relationships. <br /> <br />If you like Le Guin, worth a read.	2005-08-12

Author Kenneth Davis succeeds in offering a single-volume of American history covering most major events and eras in simple, accessible language. Yet Davis fails to craft a balanced book, his own political viewpoints and biases too often intruding upon the text. It's unfortunate, because his victory in putting together such a book is noteworthy.<br />The audio reading here is extraordinary. The tone is lively and engaging, and the use of several narrators (changing places for chapter titles and famous quotes) brings a welcome change of pace to what could be a monotonous 20-plus hours. The production is very good, the sound crisp, and chapter titles are read aloud. (I hate audio books that skip chapter titles).<br />As it purports to do, &quot;Don't Know Much...&quot; runs the gamut of American history, from the earliest explorers to September 11, 2001, and just about every major event in between. Events are summarized and explained in easy to understand language, making a great starting point for those developing a love for history, or readers looking to refresh their memory of history lessons learned long ago. Throughout are timelines on major events (the Civil War, World War II, etc.) and quotes from key historical figures. Overall, the presentation is wonderful and will be a boon to those with even a passing interest in history. A well-formatted piece. <br />In the audio edition, the timelines come across as awkward. The quotes, however, are wonderful. Two other narrators, a male and female, handle the chores here, serving to break the listener away for a moment and sink into the famous quote. Impersonations are also excellent. These add a lot of flavor to the reading.<br />Unfortunately, despite his claims otherwise, the author fails to leave his political viewpoints out of the picture. (Right from the start, Davis spends ten minutes telling you why his book is NOT biased. That screams of protesting a bit too much). His viewpoint intrudes too often, and after a while it becomes an unwelcome distraction.<br />As far as Davis is concerned, business in America is a Great Evil, never having done anything that wasn't corrupt, dishonest and brutal. Not once does he offer a story about business improving the American way of life, yet dozens of examples are given about what mean-spirited murderers businessmen are. If it entails business, it is Bad. Always.<br />Corrupt seems to be Davis' view of all of American history. No bravery, sacrifice, grand vision, or good intentions in Davis' America (even those who fought slavery did so out of greed, not a desire to free slaves, according to the author). No inspiration, can-do spirit, hands-on building of a new world. Nothing worth being proud of. Only greed, murder, racism, and more greed. An objective writer would have noted that America was built on both the good and the bad.<br />Davis' propensity to inject racist motivations into event after event is equally troubling. America's history with racism is indeed disturbing and shameful; that it is well-chronicled here is unquestionably commendable. Yet the author also seems to inject racism in almost everything, whether or not there is any indication that race played a part in the historical event.<br />None of this is to say the book does not have merits. It does. The writing is crisp, fast-paced, detailed, and informative. The light humor is welcome. Almost every major era in American history is covered. Davis also makes an effort to put events in the context of their times, helping us better understand what key events meant in the long term. It is an engaging look at history.<br />Don't Know Much About History is easy to recommend to a casual reader looking for a quick primer on American history - with the caveat that they are getting a skewed view of things. The book will be all but worthless to a history buff - you won't learn anything new here. The book may well be abrasive and irritating to those who want their history with a little more balance, but as a single-volume chronicle of American history that is both complete and well-written, it would be difficult not to recommend this. The bias is there, sure, but for those willing to look past it, this is a solid selection. And for the price, the unabridged audio edition is a fantastic bang for the buck.	2004-06-12

A brisk read, the 200 or so pages here are filled with examples of government gone awry, absurd legal maneuvers, and public policies that defy common sense.<br />Silly lawsuits and wholly unnecessary laws are central to Howard's rants on over-aggressive government. The book is filled with specific examples, usually followed by pretty sound reasoning as to WHY we, too, should be irritated. All that is missing are solutions. The author offers some, but they are few and far between.<br />One thing is certainly welcome: Politics rarely intrude here. Well-written and to the point, Howard doesn't appear to be walking far to the right or the left. The political neutrality is welcome. There is probably a libertarian bent present, but it's hardly intrusive; this is not a political book. And in these times of overly political books, that is a classic Good Thing.<br />A quick read, paced well with plenty of examples, this is a good pick for those who enjoy peering at the foibles of misguided government.	2004-06-12

And yes, you are likely to enjoy this book.<br />Stephen Ambrose wasn't the greatest pure writer in the world - he won't dazzle you with his prose - but he was adept at giving the reader revealing glimpses of life as a soldier in World War II. That's exactly what he does here in Band of Brothers, which inspired the dazzling 10-hour HBO miniseries of the same name. The day-to-day life of the WWII soldier comes alive in the pages of this book.<br />Crisp and fast-paced, Band of Brothers does not get as bogged down in detail his other best-known works WWII, D-Day and Citizen Soldier. For the researcher that might not be a good thing, but for the general reader (especially the casual reader simply looking for some insight into WWII) it provides a good read that educates AND entertains. That's a valuable mix in bringing history to the masses. <br />Those who have read both Citizen Solider and D-Day might appreciate the brief dip back into Ambrose waters, but they might also be turned off by the anecdotes from those books repeated here. It appears much of the research that went into those books was also used for Band of Brothers. That's not to say there is nothing new here. There is. This is a book smaller in scope because the focus is on one company - Easy Company of the 101st Airborne.<br />Ambrose takes us from training to the end of the war, following the successes and failings of Easy Company. We experience their story in their own voice, as remembered by the actual men of Easy Company. The book is a great standalone read, and makes for a fabulous supplement to the miniseries.<br />Band of Brothers is a good, solid World War II read that should satisfy all save the most scholarly of WWII readers. They would be better off avoiding this in lieu of a tome more dense withinformation. This is history for mass appeal. At its core, Band of Brothers is a book that allows a group of WWII vets to recount old war stories. And that makes for some enjoyable reading.	2004-06-12

Martin's \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series is easily among the very best. With masterful prose, a twisting story that never finds slows down, and characters that live and breathe, \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" sets into a motion a tale that will no doubt stand as a high point in modern fantasy.<br />Lovers of high fantasy; epic war stories; tales of royal intrigue; and character-based, plot-driven stories will not be disappointed by this. Those looking for another \\"young man goes on a quest,\\" \\"a dark lord is rising,\\" or \\"a brand new take on magic\\" story will be. Martin manages to throw away every modern fantasy clich&eacute; yet creates an eminently readable fantasy tale. There is little not to like here.<br />The cast of characters is huge, and Martin manages to make us believe them all. We hate them, we love them, we loathe them and we pity them. But most important of all, we BELIEVE them. The characters are consistent, complex and fascinating.<br />They're also in danger at every moment.<br />Martin, you see, has no qualms about killing off major characters. The violence is swift and gruesome. Moments of tension truly ARE tense because he establishes very early that main characters can and will die. And their deaths make sense. They are never played for shock value, serving the plot in a way that never feels forced, that follows what has come before, and that serves the narrative in a believable fashion.<br />And what an ever-changing narrative it is. If the title \\"A Game of Thrones\\" sounds a bit like chess, the plot looks like one, too. Viewpoints change with each chapter (we jump from character to character frequently), and rarely is space wasted in this 800-page tome. Virtually every chapter reveals important information or, more times than not, sends the plot spinning in a new, unexpected (yet perfectly sensible and believable) direction. Martin teases you with obvious plot twists that never take place, then sends you reeling when you doubt the obvious only to have it actually happen. There is little predicting what will happen next ... and that's great. The story keeps you on your toes.<br />(A brief word of warning: Not only is the violence explicit, but the language and sex, too, are explicit. The easily offended should steer clear)<br />The \\"fantasy\\" in this first volume is minimal, with just a few strange creatures, hints at others, and but a sparse bit of magic. Instead, the first book in this series is rooted with grim realism, a story about people good and evil in conflict, pushing and pulling over honor and power.

For some, that alone may be enough to warrant a purchase.<br />For those looking for an in-depth Star Wars read, look elsewhere. This is casual reading material. The book's pacing is brisk and the reading light. Experienced readers will polish this off in one lazy Saturday afternoon, while younger readers will enjoy this over the course of a week. This isn't a BAD thing, of course - it just is what it is. And what it is, is a fairly run of the mill movie novelization.<br />While this isn't as essential as some original Star Wars books, most notably those by Timothy Zhan, hardcore Star Wars fans will probably want to check this out. It is, after all, one of the core group of stories around which the Star Wars universe was based. In addition, some non-film material (Luke training with Yoda comes to mind) is interesting enough to make you see the movie in a different light. Just don't expect classic literature. This is a novelization of a movie, and reads like it. Nice beach reading, and little more.	2004-06-12

The hallmarks of George R.R. Martin's series have been political intrigue, swift and deadly violence (even main characters are killed without a second thought), and gritty, \\"realistic\\" fantasy. If this sounds like your cup of tea, dig in. If not - maybe you like a little more magic, a little more flash - tread carefully.<br />Here in volume 2, Martin picks up where he left off on A Game Of Thrones (quite literally) and further expands his epic masterpiece. In this second volume, A Clash Of Kings, Martin again pits lords and ladies, armies and rogues, and warring factions against one another in a sprawling, massive tale.<br />Featuring a huge page count and a tremendous cast of characters, this tome is dense, even moreso than A Game Of Thrones. More subplots are thrown into the mix than before, and more storylines are twisted together into ever tighter knots, expending the scope of the already lengthy tale. Like the first volume, Martin pulls this off by using fairly short, punchy chapters, each focusing on a different character and each serving to move the plot forward and keep this otherwise hefty book moving along at a rapid pace.<br />That's not to say Martin doesn't stumble slightly here and there. Unlike A Game Of Thrones, which was the leanest 900-page book you'll ever read, not every page in A Clash Of Kings is vital. A few of the subplots are given too much time, developing over a longer period than they need to; they serve only to slow the narrative. Also, several chapters appear to fill time rather than push the plot forward or offer an important revelation.<br />But these criticisms are minor. Martin weaves and twists plots as well as any, paints characters we can truly believe, and builds builds builds to a rousing, thrilling and surprising climax that is superior to the wrap up of volume one. All in all, this installment lives up to the expectations set by the first. And they were lofty expectations indeed.<br />Without question George R.R. Martin has once again given readers one of the best fantasy novels to hit the bestseller list in a long, long time. This is some of the best the genre has to offer right now and is a must read for any fan of epic, gritty high fantasy.	2004-06-12

After the steadily slowing saga began to drag, drag, drag, I decided to bail on Jordan's bloated epic. Based on the reviews of volumes 9 and 10, I'm glad I did. After reading this installment, I'm surprised people have stuck on for two more. At one time I was enthralled with the story; now I could not care less about the tale's resolution.<br />I won't be finishing this series, and I don't mind a bit.<br />What was once an epic, well-plotted, well-paced story with interesting characters and an intriguing (if dense) plot became by this volume a plodding, directionless, dreary mess with little to grip the reader save increasingly bad and repetitive characterization and prose begins to grate. (The decline, for me, began in volume 6, but the story remained engaging enough to keep going. By Path of Daggers, that was no longer the case)<br />The most blunt review one can give would look like this: This book is boring.<br />Very little happens. The characters are either badly portrayed or are simply annoying. The writing is mediocre. The plot - well, there isn't a plot.<br />Rather than tie up plot threads, Robert Jordan instead lets them dangle, barely even inching them forward. He abandons some subplots whole. While doing this, he throws even MORE plot threads out. The massive story that once moved with great agility despite its size now lumbers like a drunken beast. It's as if Jordan is trying to figure out where to go next. It seems Jordan is writing from the hip - and it doesn't work.<br />If you've gotten through the volumes before this but are unsure if you want to go on, I can only urge that you DON'T. If you're a Jordan loyalist, read on, but others should be warned that from here on in, it's all downhill.	2004-06-12

Finding a dud in her catalog is difficult indeed.<br />Of the handful of works hailed as her greatest, \\"The Left Hand Of Darkness,\\" \\"The Dispossessed\\" and the Earthsea books are among the best known and most respected.<br />In \\"The Left Hand Of Darkness,\\" we follow an envoy from a federation of worlds who has come to a planet steeped in an eternal winter with a task: To bring the planet and its people into the federation. It is a tale of culture clashes, of seeing through the eyes of others, and of adapting to those different than yourself.<br />Most frequently cited as central to the book's theme are the overt gender differences on the planet (all people are of no gender, or both, and reproduce freely among one another).<br />\\"The Left Hand Of Darkness\\" has less to do with its alleged subject matter (non-gender sexuality) than is often suggested, though when it does get into the subject, delves into it with grace and subtlety. The reader never feels beaten over the head. Yet the meeting and understanding of cultures has less to do with the sexuality involved than with simply UNDERSTANDING and accepting.<br />While this is considered a genre work, the book has very little in the way of alien technology; do not expect \\"hard\\" SF. Yes, it takes place on another planet. Yes, other worlds are mentioned. Yes, most of the characters are essentially \\"aliens.\\" But the story does not rely on technology. This could have been a story of culture clash set right here on Earth and it would have been just as effective.<br />At its core this is a wonderful story exploring the idea of how people relate to one another on an intimate level. And there's some intriguing political stuff going on behind the scenes, too.<br />LeGuin deserves every bit of praise she gets. A true master and one ofthe best genre writers of the last 40 years, her works transcend fantasy and science fiction like few others.	2004-06-12

Most of the action centers on Taran, a pig keeper destined for great things. Others, including a stereotypical spoiled princess, a crazed Gollum-like creature, and a hapless bard, take part in a series of increasingly epic adventures.<br />\\"The Black Cauldron\\" is probably the best known of the series (in part due to Disney's unfortunate film of the book). In this volume, Taran and friends return, this time to face a terrible evil that can spread lifeless hordes across the land. Old faces return, new bad guys appear, and the world of Prydain is further expanded in this classic addition to a classic series.<br />Because Alexander draws his stories from ancient myth and legend, the themes and situations always feel familiar, like stories you've read many times before - but never in a tiresome way. They're \\"comfortable.\\" And that's a welcome trait, especially when so many books try so hard to be different.<br />The writing is direct and lively throughout (though darker in tone that the first book), and the pacing absolutely perfect. Just when one suspects a lull in the action is looming, Alexander surges us forward and advances the story some more. Things are always pushing forward, offering a tale that one is hard-pressed to put down.<br />One of the great joys of this series is the steady progression from pure children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer, more mournful tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. The first book does not well reflect the last. What begins as a light fantasy becomes very serious. That is a good thing and is very much on display here.<br />\\"The Black Cauldron\\" is hailed as a classic of young fantasy for a reason.

Here in \\"The High King,\\" that shows itself in spades. This is a serious work comparable to anything the fantasy genre has to offer. While appropriate for children, this is hardly \\"children's fantasy.\\"<br />The action here is epic, larger in scope than anything seen in the series before. Sprawling armies clash. Wars are fought. People die. Its grim and serious stuff - but amazingly wholly suitable for readers of all ages.<br />All of our favorite characters come back for their final appears in this last volume. Taran, now grown and brave and confident, is among those to lead the charge in the final clash between ultimate good and ultimate evil. The fate of all of Prydain hangs in the balance as Arawn Death-Lord prepares to lay siege to all. The others return, too, including Eilonwy, the stereotypical spoiled princess, Gurgi, the crazed Gollum-like creature, and Fflewddur Fflam, the hapless bard who is prone to exaggeration.<br />One of the great joys of the Chronicles is the progress from lighthearted fantasy to adult themes and a grim tone. By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a lifetime of journeys, learning from them as they went. It all culminates here, with joy, sadness, pain, death, and sacrifice mixing together to form a classic adventure tale.<br />Because Alexander draws his stories from ancient myth, these feel like stories you've read many times before - yet that never comes across in a tiresome way. It's a story that operates in a welcome comfort zone, nice in a time when so many books try so hard to bedifferent solely for the sake of being different.<br />The Prydain Chronicles, and \\"The High King\\" especially, is recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy. Classic stuff in every way.	2004-05-16

Others, including a stereotypical spoiled princess, a crazed Gollum-like creature, and a hapless bard, take part in a series of increasingly epic adventures.<br />Because Alexander drew his stories from ancient myths and legends, the themes and situations always feel familiar. These will feel like stories you've read many times before, but never in a tiresome way. They're \\"comfortable.\\" And that's a welcome trait, especially when so many books try so hard to be different.<br />This first volume if five, \\"The Book of Three,\\" is probably the weakest of the series (though it is by no means bad, or even average). Taran seems to get caught up in his adventure rather too easily, and initially, before we become comfortable with the characters, some of them are a little grating. Gurgi is almost a downright annoyance.<br />But then the story really kicks into gear and develops into a nice adventure tale, setting the stage for the better Prydain books to come later. What \\"The Book of Three\\" does best is put in place the pieces of the great big puzzle that is put together throughout the next four books.<br />And who couldn't love the delightful early stages of Taran and Eilonwy's relationship? Delightful and funny is every way. Children will relate to the characters and the way they pick on each other, while adults will smile knowingly as Alexander winks and nods.<br />The writing is direct and lively throughout, and the pacing absolutely perfect. Just when one suspects a lull in the action is looming, Alexander races us forward and advances the adventure some more. Things are always progressing, always pushing forward, offering a tale that one is hard-pressed to put down.<br />One of the great joys of this series is the steady progression from pure children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer, more mournful tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. The first book does not well reflect the last. What begins as a light fantasy becomes very serious. And that is a good thing.<br />\\"The Book of Three\\" and the rest of the Prydain Chronicles are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy.	2004-05-16

By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a lifetime of journeys, learning from them as they went.<br />This is very much front and center in \\"Taran Wanderer,\\" a sad, lonely tale of Taran's quest to find out who he truly is. While appropriate for all ages and sure to be enjoyed by young readers, older readers will find the harrowing decisions Taran has to make gripping and heart-wrenching.<br />Because Alexander draws his stories from ancient myth and legend, the themes and situations here will feel familiar, like stories you've read many times before. Yet that never comes across in a tiresome way. It's a story that operates in a welcome comfort zone, nice in a time when so many books try so hard to be different solely for the sake of being different. The story told in \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a timeless tale because of its familiarity and will engage readers for many years to come.<br />The focus here is more strongly on Taran than in any other volume, though the rest of the cast of characters returns: Eilonwy the stereotypical spoiled princess, Gurgi the crazed Gollum-like creature, and Fflewddur Fflam the hapless bard who is prone to exaggeration. Others from the past also rear their heads.<br />The pacing in this, the fourth of five books, is more deliberate. Some would say slow, but this being the type of story it is, that would be an unfair description. Rather, it lingers in Taran's quest and Taran's sadness and uncertainty.<br />\\"Taran Wanderer\\" and the rest of the Prydain Chronicles are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy.	2004-05-16

It was a strip capable of being all things gleeful and all things sad, all things goofy and all things serious.<br />Bill Watterson's genius cannot be overstated. He was a master of the comic form. He somehow managed to be funny, clever, touching, insightful, warm, cynical, uplifting, devious, nostalgic, and mischievous, all in the space of a little three- or four-panel comic strip.<br />And his Sunday strips? A feast. His use of space and color, especially in the strip's later years, was masterful. He knew how to work a page like no other.<br />In this collection, some of the best Sunday strips are collected in glorious color. Each is amended with footnotes and annotations by the creator himself, along with early pre-newspaper versions of the strips. While many of these can be found elsewhere, this collection is a nice look back at some favorites, made even better by the insight and observations of the man who drew them. Even those intimately familiar with these cartoons will learn something new about the craft of comic creation through his annotations.<br />Each comic strip is a story - and for longtime Calvin &amp; Hobbes readers, a memory. That final strip, with its clean slate of white snow into which Calvin and Hobbes disappear, talking of discovery and exploring ... just fantastic.<br />If you're a fan of Watterson's work and Calvin &amp; Hobbes, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.	2004-05-13

There is an item of great power. There is a group of innocent young folks caught up in an adventure. The item is lost. And they quest to regain the item. Throw a slew of subplots, characters, creatures and locations into the mix and you have yourself a modern fantasy tale.<br />None of this is at all bad in the case of \\"The Great Hunt,\\" which is an enjoyable read.<br />At this early stage of Jordan's series, the characters are interesting and fresh. New characters are regularly introduced, as are subplots, and all seem to fit well into the epic story gracefully being built up in this, the second volume of who knows how many. The action is brisk, the twists many, and the epic sweep of the climax engaging. Robert Jordan proves that by-the-numbers fantasy doesn't have to be bad. This works in every way and is likely to leave you turning pages until the wee hours of the morning.<br />Readers new to Jordan's series should be forewarned: It's a long series that has not yet ended, nor is there even an end in sight. With each successive volume reader complaints have increased. Many find themselves loving the early books only to quit the series before it's over. Others, however, have enjoyed the expanding scope of the story and revel in the sprawling cast of characters and innumerable subplots. It's a matter of taste, to be sure, but one thing is for certain - where Jordan's series has gone these days is certainly love it or hate it territory. Know what your tastes are and read reviews of future books before getting too deeply involved.<br />Later volumes aside, \\"The Great Hunt\\" is a worthy addition to any fantasy library and is recommended reading even for those who have no plans to actually finish the series.	2004-05-12

In this, the eighth of nine volumes, we see a return to the humor that has run through much of the series (\\"Ghost Circles\\" was grim indeed).<br />&quot;Bone&quot; is an huge story about three &quot;bone creatures&quot; and their adventures in a quaint valley of peasants, hidden princesses, dragons and creatures. Like a dark cloud looming over it all is the menace of a great evil intent on taking over the world. The series starts off lighthearted, but grows to become an epic story rooted in fantasy, without the Tolkienesque elves and dwarves.<br />This installment bring us into a city rather than the valley that has been at the center of the series. The forward progression for the grand tale is small indeed here. Instead, Smith begins to position all of the pieces of the puzzle for the final climax, while unexpectedly adding a few new pieces - a religious tyrant and an underground rebellion - to make the climax all that much more frantic.<br />Most of the action in \\"Treasure Hunters\\" takes place in the city. Few side plots or diversions outside of the city show up. The result is one of the faster reads of the \\"Bone\\" series.<BR>This is the kind of comic tale that will appeal to a wide demographic. Smith combines the classic storytelling perfected by the likes of Carl Barks (Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge) and Bill Watterson (Calvin &amp; Hobbes) - characters with outrageous and expressive faces and gestures - with the epic plotting of a sweeping fairy tale. &quot;Bone&quot; manages to balance the two well enough to be something fans of both Donald Duck and Frodo Baggins can enjoy.<br />There is no doubt people will still be reading &quot;Bone&quot; 50 years from now. Broad and epic in scope yet personal and quaint, this is a charming story in every way that will surely outlast most other comic works on the shelf.	2004-05-12

He creates a mythology peopled with an array of strange and bizarre creatures, a land built of every fantasy cliché but never itself feeling clichéd, and a tale full of inventive twists and turns.<br />Yet for all that, for all the book's burning creativity, \\"Weaveworld\\" too often fails to captivate, too often uses what feel like cheap plot twists to keep the reader moving along, and too often drags down to a near halt to make it a must read.<br />The plot hinges around a carpet in which is hidden a mystical land. The carpet, and the land, are hunted by many, including the Seerkind, Barker's twisted take on the folk of fairy tales. A pair of seemingly innocent bystanders fend off close call after close call in an effort to keep the carpet out of the wrong hands - and even venture into the wondrous world itself. The idea is fabulous and the characters unique and interesting.<br />Unfortunately, \\"Weaveworld\\" feels more like a series of interconnected novellas than an epic novel. The plot surges forward with a gripping buildup and a series of several thrilling climaxes, only to slow to a grinding halt. Then the process starts all over again. This takes place several times in just the few hundred pages. It's maddening.<br />It's also unfortunate. Barker is a good writer, better than one would expect if all they know of him is \\"Hellraiser.\\" His prose isn't bad at all, his ability to let a scene unfold very good, and he can send shivers down a reader's spine at will. He mixes horror and fantasy well. But no matter how much the readers wants them to, in \\"Weaveworld,\\" the pieces fail to come together.<br />There is enough here to like that some readers will find great enjoyment in the book - it's by no means bad, and has plenty of fresh ideas - but my own inability to really get captured by \\"Weaveworld\\" makes it impossible to recommend. If you're already a Barker fan, however, you'll probably want to read this. It's another example of his twisted and unique imagination.	2004-05-11

Looming over it all is the menace of a great evil, revealed slowly over the course of nine volumes. The series starts off lighthearted, but grows less so as the story unravels itself.<br />\\"Old Man's Cave\\" is a good example of that. The tale is compelling and dark, letting unfold the tale of Thorn, grandma and the bones, showing us the rising tide of evil in the valley, and ultimately leaving us with a thrilling conclusion filled with despair and hopelessness. It is a great climax to the second of three interwoven trilogies, and without question a perfect end to the second act of this series. When finishing this, you'll reach for the next volume right away.<br />It all works because Smith combines the kind of classic storytelling perfected by the likes of the legendary Carl Barks (Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge) and Bill Watterson (Calvin &amp; Hobbes)  - gleeful cartooning with outrageously expressive faces and gestures - with the epic and engaging plotting of a sweeping fairy tale. \\"Bone\\" walks a tightrope and walks it well, managing to be something fans of both Donald Duck and Bilbo Baggins can enjoy.<br />Comic readers able to look past the lack of men in tights (superheroes) and color artwork will delight in this series. So, too, will those generally not accustomed to comics. Little doubt people will still be reading \\"Bone\\" 50 years from now. Broad in scope yetpersonal and quaint, this is a charming story in every way that will surely outlast 90 percent of other comic works on the shelf.<br />Jeff Smith's \\"Bone\\" series is a critically acclaimed but criminally overlooked epic.

Clarke). The volume collects tales mostly published over the last few years, though one from 1947 slips into the mix, as well as a couple from the 60s.<br />Overall the work is not top-to-bottom essential, though few short story collections are. What is most striking about this volume is that Bradbury, now in his 80s, can still flex the creative muscle that made him such an honored writer.<br />In \\"One For The Road,\\" Bradbury mixes human drama and classic science fiction \\"what ifs\\" with ease. With a few scattered exceptions, the mix works splendidly.<br />These stories, by and large, are more noticeably \\"human\\" than previous works (though Bradbury has always woven tales of ordinary people with tales of the extraordinary). The first hint of science fiction does not appear until the third story in the volume, for instance, one of just a handful.<br />Bradbury can still connect. His ability to strike a chord with the reader is as potent as it was when he was 30, 40, 50 years old. Certainly Bradbury is not as consistently good as he once was, yet he retains his skill at touching on the human condition with elegance and simplicity. Emotionally impacting his readers is not a weapon lost to Bradbury's arsenal.<br />So, does \\"One For The Road\\" fare well against Bradbury's best work? Bradbury's best is among the greatest works of fiction over the last 50 years, making the question almost unfair. No, this new collection is not the equal of his best. Precious few books are. But it is a wonderful group of stories presented by one of the great authors of our time, sure to please science fiction fans and non-genre readers alike.	2004-05-09

And it works. Compiling revised versions of essays he has written since 1997, Ebert shines the spotlight on some deserving classics, and informs the reader of some little known gems.<br />His enthusiasm is clear throughout, and his selections run the gamut from well-known, mainstream flicks to art pieces to silent films. Most anybody but the most ardent of film fans will find something new to discover here, while also being afforded an opportunity to be reminded of classics we haven't seen in a while. (I bought Taxi Driver the day after reading this, remembering what a great film it was)<br />A wonderful thing about Ebert's book is that you don't have to be a student of film to enjoy this. I am NOT a student of film, just somebody who has recently developed an increasing love for the artform, and I found this book to be a great introduction to some movies I had heard of but knew little about (and quite a few I had never heard of at all).<br />Smart and informed without ever sounding lofty, accessible and direct without ever talking down to the reader, this book was a joy to read. No doubt casual film fans and students of the art alike will enjoy this.<br />At worst, some will quibble with some of Ebert's choices. But has any such list ever been compiled without a question of \\"he chose THIS over THAT?\\" By and large, his selections are solid. Let's hope for a Volume 2.	2004-05-09

Arguably too long. Thankfully, the sheer bulk of this book does not detract from King's surprisingly good characterization and the compelling plot hook - a virus that wipes out just about the whole world save a small percentage of the population. Both are handled well, with believable people and graphic depictions of the aftershocks of such a virus.<br />Only in the end, when metaphysical religious mumbo jumbo takes over, does the epic \\"The Stand\\" truly falter.<br />The uncut version of this book is a doorstop, easily surpassing 1,000 pages of text. Most of it is very good. The depictions of the virus' impact on the world are scary and well portrayed. We see well-written and detailed glimpses into the lives of our main characters - too many unnecessary and lengthy glimpses, admittedly - that allow us to know these people inside and out. And we are drawn into the world of the few survivors as they try to rebuild the world that was lost.<br />The first half, maybe two-thirds, of the book sail along briskly despite the time King takes to dwell in insignificant character details. The latter portions of the book, however, are a disappointment. A building mystery and a strong tale of survival ultimately leads to a hokey pseudo-religious showdown that fails to compel. By this point, you're turning pages not because you ant to see the mystical action unfold, but because you have already read 700 pages and are therefore compelled to keep going. A very poor end to an otherwise great buildup.<br />That criticism isn't to say the book isn't worth reading. The portions of the book that are strong - and that's most of it - are simply great. King is a better writer than some credit him as being, the story is fascinating, and the bleak future disturbing. Really great stuff (though I am inclined to read the original, \\"cut\\" version to see how it compares).<br />King fans are likely to enjoy this regardless, so pick it up. Non-Kingreaders are warned about the extreme length, much of it unnecessary. Yet those same readers should know that if they enjoy disaster stories, post-Apocalypse tales, stories about the breakdown of civilization and other such themes, \\"The Stand\\" will fit right in with your tastes. It is a well-done look at a future we hope we don't have. (They just might want to stop before the disappointing end).	2004-05-09

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	6	9	N	N	A landmark comics work	\\"Maus,\\" Art Spiegelman's moving tale of the Holocaust and how it impacts a family a generation later, is hailed as a comics classic for a reason. It is a landmark work that transcends the term \\"comics.\\"<br />Through the seemingly absurd decision to use animals in place of people - Jews are mice, for instance, while Nazis are cats - Spiegelman manages to avoid coming across as heavy-handed, exploitative and melodramatic. The reader never feels that they are reading an educational tome with badly drawn people better suited for school than compelling entertainment. Instead, through the use of universal cartoon imagery, the emotional tug of the story is successfully conveyed.<br />Two threads are woven throughout. The first deals with the Holocaust directly, from the years before Jews were taken to the camps and then to release. The second thread deals with Spiegelman's relationship with his father many years later, and that relationship's ups and downs as the author tries to get the oral history he needs to tell the tale of \\"Maus.\\" All of the pain, confusion, death, turmoil and horror of the Holocaust comes home, as does the autobiographical tale interwoven throughout of the author's relationship with his father - who is also the central figure of Holocaust survival.<br />Modern editions of this book (\\"Maus\\" was originally published in serial form) are generally produced very well. The two-book slipcase offered here is sturdy and attractive to look at. The pages are printed on thick, glossy stock. The black and white artwork really shines, every stroke visible and vibrant. Mine has been read multiple times and still looks great.<br />\\"Maus\\" is compelling reading that requires no great love of comics to enjoy. History lovers, those interested in the Holocaust, and people who like stories about family struggles will enjoy this. Readers will quickly forget they are reading a comic, instead becoming wrapped up in the story Spiegelman has to tell. A highly recommended buy.	2004-05-09

Kay dwells in sadness and melancholy - well written sadness and melancholy, to be sure - until the reader almost feels beaten over the head with it.<br />Second acts, however, are hard to really nail down, and when all is said and done, Kay's effort is admirable. Even in taking a step down from the first book, it is better than a good deal of the more pulpish fantasy out there. The climax is so good, you'll probably want to race right out and get the third.

Chadwin makes it a point to tell us Steinbrenner is a bad guy (really?), that Yankee players are all tainted (they were, after all, Yankees), that most bad people around baseball can be traced back to the Yankees (he will bend over backwards to link bad behavior and the team), and that the so-called \\"bleacher creatures\\" represent Yankee fans as a whole (a bunch of loathsome, homophobic, racist drunkards, if Chadwin's book is to be believed).<br />Make no mistake, the author can write. His prose never bores, the pacing is good, and he can turn a phrase. Those looking for a tome that will help reinforce their Yankee hatred will relish in this book. It's certainly well put together.<br />For most readers, especially those looking for a good book about baseball or the New York Yankees, this will be a book you'll want to skip. It's about neither. It's about the author's politics.<br />Dean Chadwin's book isn't to be skipped because its target is the cherished New York Yankees - have at them, I say - it's to be skipped because it's little more than a lengthy rant without a point by a bitter man.<br />At least, that's how it reads. Once. Because it's not worth reading twice.	2004-05-02

Author Kenneth Davis succeeds in offering a single-volume, broad view of American history, covering most major events and eras in simple, accessible language. Yet Davis fails to craft a balanced book, his own political viewpoints and biases too often intruding upon the text. It's unfortunate.<br />As it purports to do, \\"Don't Know Much...\\" runs the gamut of American history, from the earliest explorers to September 11, 2001, and just about every major event in between. Events are summarized and explained in easy to understand language, making this book a great starting point for those just developing a love for history, or those just looking to refresh their memory of lessons learned long ago. Interspersed throughout the tome are timelines on major events (the Civil War, World War II) and quotes from key historical figures. Overall, the presentation is wonderful and will be a boon to those with even a passing interest in history. A well-formatted piece.<br />Unfortunately, despite his claims otherwise, the author fails to leave his own political viewpoints out of the text. (Certainly the preface in the revised edition, where Davis spends pages telling you why the book is NOT biased, screams of protesting a bit too much). His viewpoint intrudes too often, increasingly so as the book grows closer to modern times.<br />As far as Davis is concerned - or at least as far as he writes - business in America is a Great Evil, never having done anything that wasn't corrupt, dishonest and brutal to the working man. Not once does he offer a success story about business improving the American way of life through technology or economic means, yet dozens of examples are given about what mean-spirited murderers businessmen are. The transcontinental railroad, for instance, did not link the two coasts and thrust America into the future, it murdered thousands of workers for the petty gain of greedy rich industrialists. An objective writer would have noted that it did both.<br />Such is Davis' vision for all of American history. America saw no instances of bravery, or sacrifice, or grand vision, or good intentions in Davis' America (even those who fought slavery did so out of greed, not a desire to free slaves, he writes). America saw no inspiration, no can-do spirit, no hands-on building of a new world. Certainly nothing worth being proud of. Only greed, murder, racism, and more greed. Davis harps on these themes repeatedly. It a pattern he repeats throughout the book. There is only one side of the American story Davis presents; that of greed and racism.<br />Davis' propensity to inject racist motivations into event after event, even when the historical record supports no such motivation, is equally troubling. America's history with racism is disturbing and shameful; that it is well-chronicled here is unquestionably commendable. Yet the author also seems to chronicle racism in almost every action taken by America since its inception, whether or not there is any indication that race played a part in the event. He assigns racist attitudes to some not out of proof, but out of his own assumptions. The message is clear: If it's a white male, it must be racist.<br />Don't Know Much's take on more recent history is most troubling in its bias. It would be difficult to chronicle here without sparking a political debate, but suffice it to say, Davis has a side of the story he wants to tell, and he tells it. Even if it's only half the story. (The best `for instance' is that during Reagan's eight years in office, the only thing that ever happened was Iran Contra. Reagan slept through the rest, according to the Davis version of the 80s. While some would agree, it's hardly an objective or balanced view of history).<br />None of this is to say the book does not have merits. It does. The writing is crisp, fast-paced yet detailed, and informative. The humor is light and welcome. Most eras in America's history are covered, including very good coverage of the pre-Revolution years, a period often overlooked in history books. The pace of the reading is brisk, yet the information rarely stops flowing, a feat few historical writers can manage. Davis also makes an effort to put events in the context of their times, and to contrast events with what came before and after. Putting history in its place helps us understand it better, and here the author does well. It is an engaging book to read.<br />Bias aside, Don't Know Much About History is easy to recommend to a casual reader just looking for a quick primer on American history - with the caveat that they are getting a skewed view of things. The book will be all but worthless to the student of history - you won't learn anything new here, though you may be entertained. And the book may well be abrasive and irritating to those who want their history with a little more balance. But as a single-volume chronicle of American history that is both complete and well-written, it would be difficult not to recommend this. The bias is there, but for readers willing to look past it, this is a solid selection.<br />A great idea by Davis, and a fine enough effort that fails only because of too much editorializing, and even then the failure is not so big as to spoil the whole thing.	2004-05-02
US	51220229	R17EZE8RQM3VM	0812576403	85474640	The Light of Other Days	Books	2	2	5	N	N	disappointing	The Light Of Other Days, by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter (though by the style of writing, it appears Clarke had little input outside of the basic concept), was sadly a tremendous disappointment.<br />The premise is simple: In the near future, scientists discover how to generate tiny wormholes that can peer anyplace, anytime - even into the past. They are cameras of unlimited and unstoppable power. Naturally, society must adapt to this great change.<br />The idea of scientists being able to unravel the past makes for a great story that could really touch on some fantastic issues. Filled with promise, it fell flat. The themes and situations that could have been explored were barely touched on. What could have been thought provoking was instead a gigantic let down. It wasn't even worth it for the revelation near the end, which was interesting but anti-climatic in much the same way as &quot;Clarke's&quot; Rama sequels were.<br />The story touched on privacy issues and other such concerns, because the device central to the plot acts as a kind of remote camera, able to see anywhere and everything, but that theme is badly managed and poorly handled. An underground society that arises is painted half-heartedly, and the paranoia of those gripping with this changed world does not come across.<br />Even the writing is less than gripping, often slow and boring. The characters are stale, the prose sloppy. Both men are better writers than this.<br />Fans of either author would do well to save their money.	2004-05-02
US	51220229	R20LW9BHZFDG6Q	0345322401	193021593	The Songs of Distant Earth	Books	4	153	159	N	N	Some of Clarke's best later work	\\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\" is an engaging story centered around one of Arthur C. Clarke's deceptively simply plot hooks: Prior to the destruction of the Earth in a nova 1,500 years from now, \\"seedships\\" were sent to the stars so humanity could live on. An early seedship birthed a small, Eden-like civilization on a planet called Thalassa.<BR>Now, hundreds of years after this society achieved near perfection, another seedship has arrived. And it is carrying people who have come directly from the now destroyed Earth.<br />Like most of Clarke's work, \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\" is a story driven by ideas. Ideas about how the future of humanity will turn out. Ideas about how we will eventually solve the problems of today. And ideas about how we will finally reach the stars, and what we'll do when we get there.<br />Unlike much of his later work, \\"Songs\\" holds up well. This is not only the best of his late-period writing, but falls in with the very best novels he has written no matter the era. The pacing is quick, with a new revelation or theory around every corner, luring the reader deeper into the story with short, pithy chapters, each revealing a small (but fascinating) part of an intricate whole.<br />Most of the classic Clarke hallmarks are here, including the handful of themes that grew to dominate his later works. The space elevator, the possibly intelligent yet wholly alien lifeform, the theories on how humans will cross the gulf between the stars, and the diatribes against religion.<br />The cast of characters is not huge, but he rotates the viewpoint from chapter to chapter between about half-a-dozen of the people. The variety is good, as subtlety in painting his characters has never been a Clarke strong suit.<br />As mentioned, \\"Songs\\" is driven by ideas. The first third of the book, maybe even the first half, is a never-ending stream of theories and predictions and discoveries. One of the author's great strengths is his ability to easily yet convincingly paint a picture of mankind's future. What takes other authors chapter after chapter to flesh out Clarke manages in small and succinct bites.<br />This book is heavy with the hallmarks of later Clarke. Those of a strongly conservative philosophy may be uncomfortable with some of Clarke's blunt thoughts on matters like religion, guns and sexuality.<br />Like all of his later works, the book is permeated with Clarke's disdain for organized religion (save his soft spot for Buddhism). Sometimes he is subtle, sometimes not; here, one entire chapter is devoted to one character's monologue about why religion is The Great Evil.<br />And Clarke does not limit the anti-religious sentiments to his characters; he openly debases the entire concept of God in the narrator's voice on several occasions. It's somewhat jarring to have the author's philosophy pushed in the voice of the narrator rather than through a character. Of course, Clarke readers should not be surprised by this, as it has been a running theme in his stories for years.<br />The inclusion of one specific passage on another subject, however, is puzzling, as it serves no purpose to the story and seems only to have been included for Clarke to expose a political viewpoint. Clarke uses the irrelevant scene to espouse his view that gun ownership is a \\"perversion,\\" notes that the character has stirrings in his loins when holding the gun, and passes the gun off as a phallic symbol. The gun never comes into play again. A puzzling and an unnecessary intrusion of politics.<br />Also like later Clarke, the author runs with the presumption that everyone is somewhat bisexual. At one point, he indicates that in the future people who are 100 percent heterosexual are considered flawed and borderline psychotic. The author isn't always so heavy-handed, however, and his frank but not in-your-face treatment of the subject is almost refreshing in its casualness.<br />None of this should serve to ruin the story even for those who lean to the right, because like Arthur C. Clarke at his best, he lays out a possible future and how we got there with almost flawless execution. Only once or twice does his handling of political and social issues feel heavy-handed.<br />Also like Clarke at his best, he lures the reader along with hints of discovery at every turn; discovery, not preaching, drives the story. This is best reflected in the discovery of a life form indigenous to Thalassa. Clarke's revelations about them are spaced evenly throughout the novel - the better to lure you along - and walk that fine balance between telling you enough to keep you interested but not so much that your imagination is spoiled.<br />Because Clarke's stories generally don't hitch on some raging conflict or objective-based scenario, this one included, the ending may seem anti-climatic. Plot threads introduced midway through the book that look as if they will heat up are resolved well before the end. But that is Clarke. He presents an idea, a snapshot of the future, serves up a slice and gets out before the idea wears itself thin. That is a great strength of his work.<br />All in all, \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\" stands as one of Clarke's best novels, surpassed only by his true classics. It is certainly the very best of his later work. No Arthur C. Clarke fan should go without reading this one, and probably neither should any fan of the genre.	2004-05-01

Whereas the original novels were built upon layers of magic and wonder and a vast, epic feel, this novel is smaller, more human, telling a more internal story. It is the story of our beloved Tenar, from 'Tombs,' and of her struggles with motherhood, age, and with being a woman.<br />As always, the prose is outstanding, flowing like poetry throughout. Tenar herself is far more flesh and blood than she was in her first appearance, and Ged (who plays a support role only) is altogether another person, torn by his battles in the realm of the dead. Still, the magic is missing, the sweep and scope is missing, ultimately sapping the life from what could have been an extraordinary book.<br />Had this not been Earthsea part 4, I would have rated it higher. Being among such lofty companions, however, expectations are high. It simply ends up being a very good book, and little more.	2004-04-29

Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.<br />As always with Bradbury, expect a steady pacing to his prose with an almost melodic rhythm. Bradbury reads well, especially aloud, and rewards readers who allow themselves to sink into the pace of the book.<br />You'll note, 9 out of 10 bad reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough). Not unexpected, and rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view, as these narrow-minded children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future. Bradbury's warnings ring true.<br />Bradbury readers should pick this up without pause. Those who enjoy bleak stories of potential futures, too, should explore this important work.	2004-04-29

It's that simple.<br />Without question, Earthsea stands alongside Middle Earth, Narnia, and the other \\"classic\\" fantasy worlds with amazing strength, holding its own throughout.<br />And like those worlds, the tales of Earthsea are accessible to young readers, and yet offer layers of depth and meaning for older readers.<br />Le Guin weaves a tale in a language seemingly pulled our dreams, gorgeous prose throughout. She tells her tale of good against evil and of the triumph of man over his fears in such a way as to make one think that this is not a story that was written in the 20th century, but rather a story that always was. Perfect craft. A Wizard of Earthsea is a timeless work telling the tale of one man's struggle with magic, and himself.<br />Modern fantasy lovers beware, this is not a typical swords and sorcery romp. Fans of the Dragonlance and TSR books will miss the cartoon-like action, and fans of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind will miss the endless meandering that dominates so much modern fantasy. Instead, you simply get a tale crafted of magic and wonder that gets right to the point, never pausing, never dragging, always engaging. Truly remarkable, even decades later.	2004-04-29

Also like previous installments, \\"The Silver Chair\\" brings back familiar characters while also introducing new cast members, lending the story an air of familiarity while still remaining fresh.<br />In this installment Eustace, the ill-mannered lad who learned the error of his ways in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,\\" along with his schoolmate, Jill, pair up for adventure. While fleeing bullies at their school - a progressive and modern (for its time) institution that Lewis openly and repeatedly scorns - Eustace and Jill find themselves thrown into the world of Narnia. Once there, Aslan gives Jill a series of vague instructions to follow during their adventure.<br />Eustace and Jill find themselves on a quest to find the lost Prince Rillian, the son of King Caspian (who in this tale makes two brief cameos as an old man). They team up with Puddleglum, a gloomy a creature called a Marsh-Wiggle who always sees the down side of things. Together, the three go in search of the Prince.<br />The setup tells the reader right off what sort of story it will be: a traveling adventure in which the group works through a series of dangerous situations and visits new and strange lands. The story takes a few chapters to get moving properly, shortening the main quest; there are only three or so key locations. Still, those locations are a mix of classic genre archetypes and fantastic settings. For an important segment of the story - a castle of giants - genre archetypes rule the day.<br />\\"Silver Chair,\\" though it visits places in Narnia not previously seen, feels less epic than previous installments. However, a glimpse of a greater and more wondrous world near the end helps alleviate that failing.<br />The character of Jill undergoes almost the same transformation that Eustace did in \\"Voyage,\\" while Eustace himself plays the role that Edmund, Peter and the gang did in earlier books. That's not altogether bad, but it's not altogether good, either, especially if you are reading the whole series straight through. because Jill's transformation immediately follows Eustace's.<br />All in all, \\"The Silver Chair\\" is not as engaging as others in the series, with a loose plot tied together largely by a \\"you must trust Aslan\\" theme, but does not fall nearly as flat as \\"Caspian.\\" For a good stretch the story moves along at a brisk pace and offers a playful series of adventures, delivering just the sort of engaging story that makes the Narnia Chronicles such a beloved series. Sure it suffers from too slow a start and too slow a finish, both which drag the story down, but at its core it's more of the same from Narnia. And that's not a bad thing at all.	2004-04-24

The story picks up where \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" leaves off, with Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy back in England after having spent many years in Narnia as kings and queens. What follows is in many ways almost a straight rehash of \\"Wardrobe\\" and is possibly the most forgettable of the Narnia books. Were it not for the introduction of Caspian, one of the major characters in the series, it would almost certainly be the least memorable of the seven books.<br />The children find themselves pulled into a strange world, this time by a magical force rather than by wandering through a wardrobe. Quickly (and predictably) enough the world is revealed to be Narnia. Why did they not know this right away? Because the single year they spent in the real world was many hundreds of years in Narnian time. Narnia has aged while they have not.<br />The four children, who in Narnia are revered as legendary kings and queens of old, find that they have been pulled into Narnia to aid King Caspian, a prince from a kingdom of rather oppressive humans who have taken over Narnia and are attempting to squash all memory and knowledge of the land's talking animals and mythical creatures. Naturally, this means those people have to be stopped.<br />If it sounds exciting, it's not. If it sounds boring, it is.<br />Travelogues and adventures that are little more than episodic journeys can be great fun and often tap into the glory of exploring the forest as a child, but this journey simply has little or nothing to engage the reader or capture one's interest. The glimpses of how Narnia has changed in the years since the four kids were there are interesting, but the interest is minimal at best. The travels just lack punch or adventure.<br />Lewis takes a few ill-advised detours that seem only to pad the story while hammering home the idea that people who do not believe in the mystical creatures of Narnia are inherently bad. The heavy-handed messaging in other Narnia volumes generally feel like the moral messages of any other classic fairy tale, but here they somehow feel wrong.<br />All in all, \\"Prince Caspian\\" adds very little to the lore (and lure) of Narnia despite being a part of the central plot, with core Narnia characters throughout. Its greatest contribution to the series is introducing the off-kilter time concept, an old clich&eacute; of alternate world stories, and bringing the character of Caspian (as well as the delightful and brave mouse Reepicheep) to the series. And that's about this book's whole worth. It introduces you to characters you will grow to like later and to concepts essential to the series.<br />Take note, because \\"Prince Caspian\\" is part of the core Narnia books (those involving the four original children and the characters linked directly to them) it's hard to recommend skipping this one - but it really fails to live up to the fantastic spectacle of the others.

Lewis' classic Narnia series, and contains all the magic, wonder and adventure of the others in the series. Maybe more.<br />Like most of the Narnia books, \\"Voyage\\" takes little time to get moving. Edmund and Lucy are staying with their mean and arrogant little cousin Eustace (Peter and Susan are excised from the story for being too old), when the three children are pulled into the world of Narnia. Edmund and Lucy are delighted to have arrived, but Eustace is bitter at the situation. He is made even more bitter because of where they appear: In the middle of the ocean, where they are picked up by King Caspian on his ship, the Dawn Treader.<br />Caspian is in the midst of a grand journey in which he is trying to sail to the end of the world. Tossed into the mix is his quest to find seven companions of his father, who fled Narnia when the bad folks from \\"Prince Caspian\\" took over. The entire plot is little more than an excuse to sail to lands unknown and explore the most fantastic sights Narnia has to offer. The story does not fail in that endeavor.<br />While it begins as Another Narnia Adventure, \\"Voyage\\" quickly becomes an exploration adventure of the most classic kind, an archetype of a tale in which every action drives the characters towards the next episode and the next land of wonder. Like other timeless tales of this type, the device is remarkably effective in keeping the reader's interest and repeatedly engage one's sense of awe.<br />Naturally, there are Lessons thrown in for good measure. Lewis can occasionally grate with moralizing, but \\"Voyage's\\" moral tales are not grating in the least. Most are tales that have been told time and again throughout mankind's history. Each island has its own little moral message, but they are subtle, fit with the story well, serve the sense of wonder the reader feels, and never intrude on the tale. That's a welcome thing.<br />In theend, no terrible bad guy is vanquished. No kingdom is won. Nobody turns out to secretly be royalty. None of that. It simply ends when the quest is done. And that end satisfies.<br />\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" may be the very best of the Narnia books and a journey for the ages. Here, Lewis crafts a classic tale of a fantastic journey, and he does so with a finely balanced sense of pacing. \\"Voyage\\" never fails to be engaging and will surely delight readers both young and old.	2004-04-24

Lewis' famous Narnia Chronicles, \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is the story of Narnia's creation in the guise of an adventure shared by two children, Digory and Polly. Though among the last Narnia books published, chronologically \\"Nephew\\" is the first of the Narnia stories. That doesn't mean it has to be read first, and for a number of reasons many would argue that it *shouldn't* be read first - but that is a debate in and of itself.<br />The tale leaps to a strong start, telling of Digory and Polly's escapades in exploring the attic of the rowhouse in which they live, and how they stumble into the secret study of Digory's Uncle Andrew. Andrew is not a Good Uncle, he is a Bad Uncle, and he tricks the children into teleporting to another world as part of his experiments with ancient magic. In doing so, Digory and Polly find themselves exploring other, fantastic worlds.<br />All of this is, of course, simply the setup for what happens later and serves to lead the children to Narnia. It is also the most effective part of the book.<br />During their adventures, the pair wake an ancient and evil queen who is out to conquer any world she comes to. A merry bit of failed escaping between worlds ensues as the children try to flee the power-hungry queen.<br />The pacing of the book up to here is very good, moving at a fairly brisk speed and keeping the reader interested by adding ever-mounting troubles and discoveries. Classic fairy tale stuff done exceptionally well. \\"Nephew\\" also boasts some of the most effective evil characters in the entire series, with both the queen and Uncle Andrew coming across as fearsome, nasty antagonists. All in all, through the first half of the book one finds themselves in the midst of a fantastic children's adventure.<br />Then it grinds to a halt.<br />\\"Nephew\\" is about Narnia's creation, so naturally enough the adventures of the book's first half serve to set Narnia's birth and the trials that follow. Unfortunately, the setup is farbetter than the tale it was setting up, causing the book's second half to read like a long coda rather than a rousing climax.<br />Sure, the \\"firsts\\" of Narnia and a few of its trademark features are revealed to the reader. We get to see the origins of the White Witch, how Narnia came to be populated with Talking Beasts, the origins of the lamppost from \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\\" and even why the wardrobe was a portal to Narnia ... and yet none of this manages to fully satisfy.<br />All of this is unfortunate indeed, because \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" gets off to such a good start. It possibly leaps forward better than any other book in the series, and for a time seems as if it will offer as engrossing and adventurous a tale as was told in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\\" Instead it bogs down just as it should be picking up, all but standing still for the final six chapters or so.<br />It's not the worst of the Narnia books - \\"Prince Caspian\\" probably holds that honor - but it is lifted from oblivion only by the wonderful adventures that open the book.<br />Still, even bad Narnia is better than most children's fantasy, earning this four stars.	2004-04-24

Seeing an opportunity to makes others do what he wants, Shift forces Puzzle to wear the lion skin and pretend he is Aslan. The ape's deception is central to both the conflict that drives the story and the questions of faith and belief that act as this book's moral center.<br />That conflict and the events which follow lend the story a tension not found in the previous six books, largely because the ape's deceptions just feels *wrong* in every way. The populace of Narnia believes the false Aslan is the real thing, even when he begins to sell them into slavery. Narnia's last king, King Tirian, tries to convince the Narnians that this Aslan is not real, but most are either too scared to not believe or are losing their faith in Aslan altogether. Enter Eustace in his third Narnia appearance and Jill in her second.<br />The tale moves along at a good pace, driven sometimes by action and other times by a pressing need to know what will happen next. After six Narnia book, the effect of Narnians turning away from Aslan is compelling. What little hope there is for the Good Guys falters again and again, which only adds to the steadily growing tension of the book's first two-thirds. It's effectively done and reads well; it is also has a more serious tone than previous Narnia books, similar to the difference in tone from Lloyd Alexander's first Prydain book and the last.<br />It is roughly two-thirds of the way through that the story takes a left turn in much the same way \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" shifts its focus. Here, however, the effect is not as jarring as it was in \\"Magician.\\" It works largely because the sense of wonder and discovery present in much of Lewis' work is here in spades.<br />The final chapters of the book may be overly spiritual for some readers, but by and large that spirituality is of the same sort present at the end of \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,\\" a wondrous, timeless sort of revelation that fits within the framework of a fairy tale. Those readers who want to see Christian elements in the tale's finish surely will see them, but one can easily enough read it as the magical end to an equally magical saga told in the tradition of ancient storytelling.<br />Themes of faith, belief and trust drive \\"The Last Battle\\" forward.<BR>All time-tested themes, and Lewis weaves them into a good enough story that they rarely feel heavy-handed. Because the story ends as it does, \\"Battle\\" offers true closure to the series, a rarity in lengthy works of fiction where \\"one more installment\\" is always a possibility.<br />\\"The Last Battle\\" is a well written and superbly fitting end to C.S.<BR>Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, granting readers a compelling conflict before delivering on a finish that satisfies in spite of the near deux ex machina end to it all. The book manages to tie the elements of the six previous volumes together to close out one of the most beloved children's series of all time. \\"The Last Battle\\" is fine piece of work all but the most demanding reader will enjoy.	2004-04-24
US	51220229	R3W00KZNHOF008	0064471063	440200388	The Horse and His Boy	Books	4	0	3	N	N	A Narnia side adventure that works	\\"The Horse And His Boy\\" is one of CS Lewis' classic Narnia books, one of the later published but the third if taken chronologically. The tale takes place during the time period just before the end of \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,\\" (roughly during the start of \\"Wardrobe's\\" last chapter) and is largely independent of the other six Narnia books. All of the Narnia books can be read independently, but \\"Horse\\" in particular has little link to the others.<br />The tale is a classic \\"young person escapes a bad life\\" story, and in the end becomes a classic \\"downtrodden young person saves the day\\" and a \\"young person of meager background is\\" - well, that would be giving something away. Time-tested clichés of the genre, to be sure, but not clichés in a bad way. In Lewis' tale, this is a Good Thing. Because it works.<br />The story concerns Shasta, a young boy, and a talking horse, Bree, who flee their evil masters in an attempt to reach the free land of Narnia to the north. In their flight they meet up with Aravis, a young girl also fleeing with a talking horse, Hwin. They adventure their way through the country of Calormen, a thinly-veiled substitute for the Middle Eastern countries of the real world.<br />Like the best of children's literature, the pacing is brisk and the obstacles to be overcome are introduced quickly and almost without pause.<br />As in all the Narnia books, we are introduced to Aslan. This time Aslan's role initially seems minor, but is revealed to have retroactively been a major role. It is among the worst uses of the lion in the series. Much of what the lions tells Shasta feel dreadfully like the famous poem \\"Footsteps,\\" in which Jesus explains to a walker looking at his life traced in footsteps on the beach that those moments when there were but one set of footsteps, not two for the walker and Jesus, were moments when Jesus carried the walker through life, not the walker walking through his troubles alone. In \\"Horse,\\" it slaps the reader from the story. Worse still is the fact that the entire meeting with Aslan is written in a gratingly worshipful tone that is horribly jarring; it does the story a great disservice. The scene, however, is mercifully short.<br />Because \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" is a side adventure in Narnia more than anything else, it does not have as strong a connection, and therefore sentimental tug, as the rest of the books. Still, heavy-handed Aslan scene aside, \\"Horse\\" is a delightfully simple adventure about young people escaping a bad situation. Escapism is almost never a bad thing, especially for younger people who prefer to read over playing video games, and Lewis does it very well. Most readers will thoroughly enjoy this, even if it isn't essential Narnia.	2004-04-24
US	51220229	R2LXIB05KFGI00	0064409422	915528414	The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full-Color Collector's Edition)	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Classic that started it all	The classic that started the Narnia ball rolling, \\"Wardrobe\\" is a rather simple story about four children (Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan) who find their way into a world where animals speak and mythical creatures are real. Once there, they help overthrow an evil witch who brought an eternal winter upon the world. Oh, and they meet a lion.<br />Lewis' writing here is geared strongly towards young children. He seems to delight in breaking the barrier between narrator and reader, telling the story as a storyteller would a gathering of kids. The style is effective in that it FEELS like a children's book, and in a good way; it's a great pleasure to read this out loud. While there are moments, however rare, when you almost feel talked down to reading as an adult, by and large Lewis succeeds in crafting a story that reads like a timeless fairy tale suitable for any reader who likes adventure, of any age. This also means \\"Wardrobe\\" may be the book in this series toughest to read for adults, if only because it has the most overly childlike-nature of the seven Narnia books.<br />The plot itself is simple, with few (if any) complexities and a fast resolution. The entire thing can easily be read in one lazy afternoon.<br />And then there is Aslan, the lion named in the title. This beast is at the center of the entire series, even moreso than the children who find themselves entering Narnia. What stands out as an adult (but is easily missed as a child) is the strong, overt Christian allegory. It is here in spades, right down to a faux crucifixion.<br />For many readers tuned into today's sensitivity to religion, or even offended by overt displays of religion, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" will simply be too heavy-handed in its religious allegory for adult readers. Not simply because of the Christian-influenced themes, but because Lewis simply beats you over the head with it. Every mention of Aslan and every scene with the lion gushes with an almost ferocious (and oftenuncomfortable) feeling that screams to the reader, \\"Rejoice!\\"<br />But to suggest that this detracts from the fun and wonder of the tale would be unfair. It DOESN'T. Only those sensitive to religion and the fervently anti-religious will have a problem with these aspects of the story. Others will just enjoy the ride.<br />As a children's tale \\"Wardrobe\\" is a fun romp through a mythic land, just the kind of wish fulfillment fantasy-loving children enjoy. And for that, I admire this book. Kids will love it - and so will adults. It's not the best of the Narnia works by any means, but it IS the first that should be read because it's the one that started it all. And as a classic of the genre this should be read by all, no matter one's religious beliefs.	2004-04-24

Dick's \\"Lies, Inc.,\\" now published in its complete form for the first time after making the rounds as \\"The Unteleported Man,\\" is a baffling book combining Dick's penchant for creating well-realized alternate timelines, his frequently expressed cynical views of a bleak future, and a foray into a delusional, drug-induced (?) world that will leave readers scratching their head for some time.<br />Like most of Dick's works, the back cover blurb barely scratches the surface of what we can expect. Sure, all of the facts are true enough, but as readers familiar with Dick know, all is not as it seems.<br />In fact, \\"all is not as it seems\\" is a major, all-consuming theme in Lies, Inc. It is the theme that drives the narrative forward, setting in motion a chain of events - some of them wholly unreal - that leads us to an unusual conclusion. And just as the main character questions the reality presented to him, when done reading the book, some readers may wonder just how much of what they read was as it appeared.<br />Roughly halfway to two-thirds of the way through Lies, Inc., the story takes an abrupt left turn, delving into a world of paranoia, drugs, hallucinations, alien creatures and alternate worlds. It is a perplexing turn, written in a hazy, meandering manner. And just as suddenly we are plunged back into the story as we left it, the narrative not missing a beat. The nature of the diversion - what it means to the narrative, what events were actually taking place and which were delusions, whether any of it really happened at all, and what the POINT was - is puzzling, because Dick provides us with no answers. Whether that is a strength or a weakness depends on your tolerance for having unanswered questions dangled before you.<br />By the end we circle back to the main narrative, nary a mention of the drug-induced diversion, and we finish the story. Baffling, but wholly satisfying as a read.<br />Taken as a whole, Dick has certainly given us better, but when Lies, Inc. shines, it does so brightly. It is a worthy read for any fan of his work, though newer readers might be inclined to start with a more accessible book, such as \\"The Man Who Japed\\" and \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep.\\"	2004-04-20

Books	3	1	2	N	N	An experiment that stumbles	It seems to be difficult to read reviews about a Bill O'Reilly book without sifting through reams of hatred directed not at the book or the ideas presented within, but at the man. Some people are so blinded by their visceral hatred they won't pause to digest what is being offered them. Assuming they've even read the book - no doubt more than half of those mentioned haven't - these so-called \\"reviews\\" are little more than potshots taken at a guy they don't like. (Filter the reviews and note how many of the one-star reviews don't even MENTION the book; that should tell you something about the motivations behind the review)<br />Too bad. But unsurprising.<br />So here's a look at the BOOK, not the MAN.<br />Those familiar with O'Reilly's last two books knows that he writes in a direct, punchy styles. Chapters are kept brief, and those are usually broken down into even smaller sections. This makes for quick reading, and for a book that can easily be put down and picked up days later without missing a beat. This style holds true with his third book, making it easily digestible in a marathon read or in small, fit-into-your-schedule chunks.<br />In typical O'Reilly fashion, he spends plenty of time dishing out criticism to those he feels wrong \\"the people.\\" Sometimes he's right on target and sometimes he's off base, but he's largely consistent, something usually absent in (semi-)political books like this one. His targets haven't changed much - he still has disdain for Hillary Clinton and Jesse Jackson - and, despite criticism to the contrary, his targets remain a fairly diverse bunch. (The charge that he goes after just one \\"type\\" is simply not an objective observation.. Witness, for instance, his harsh criticism of the Catholic Church, or his slams on the Bush Administration).<br />Where this book falls flat is during O'Reilly's \\"self help\\" sections, which make up most of the start and finish of Who's Looking Out For You? It's not that they are badly written or out of place, but rather that they are largely uninteresting, uninspiring, and are generally based on common sense. The real insights are few and far between. I have a hard time seeing any eyes being opened by the advice offered here, and the reading was not engaging. But at least those sections were relatively short.<br />The bulk of the book is usual O'Reilly fare - punchy, to the point, opinionated, and entertaining. He bounces back and forth between self-congratulation and self-effacement throughout, but never beats around the bush about how he feels. Opinions abound, and agree or disagree, he presents the opinions in an entertaining way and actually (gasp!) offers arguments to back up his positions. And isn't that why people read political/social opinion books in the first place? To see what the writer's opinions are? (The cries of \\"he's biased\\" ring so absurd as to leave me speechless, considering this is, by definition and like every other such work, a book of opinions).<br />In the end it's not as satisfying a read as his previous two tomes. The \\"self help\\" direction does not work well with O'Reilly's hard-edged style, which is engaging because it can rile you up (whether for or against him). He just does not inform or entertain to peak performance without a clear target in front of him. He is at his best when there is some person, cause of issue to rail against. And sadly, for much of this book he leaves the issues behind. O'Reilly deserves credit for trying to do something a little different, but in this case the experiment stumbled.<br />A decent enough read for ardent O'Reilly fans, but those looking for a blast of social-political opinion should seek out his first two books or another author. This one will not quench that thirst.	2004-01-12
US	51220229	R2VZTHC5J0TSE4	0826412432	466857407	Cinema of Stanley Kubrick: Third Edition	Books	2	2	3	N	N	One wonders why Kagan bothered	Kagan's tome on the works of Stanley Kubrick breaks ranks with the films it seeks to illuminate by accomplishing something those works do not - Kagan's tome is terribly BORING and ultimately says very little about the subjects it hopes to explore.<br />Yes, the Third Edition covers every Kubrick film right up to Eyes Wide Shut, claiming to be the only book on Kubrick to do so. Even if that boast is true, it does very little to address the glaring flaws that make this book one to be avoided.<br />While all of Kubrick's films are covered, most of the text on each are rambling, haphazardly written summaries of the films' plots, information we presume a student of Kubrick will find wholly unnecessarily. Worse still, he often spends more time summarizing than examining; 21 pages are devoted to regurgitating the plot of Dr. Strangelove, for instance, with just 11 pages devoted to examining the film. Kagan throws a bit of editorial comment into those summaries, but such content is sparse and rarely enlightening. <br />The summaries are preceded by a brief - sometimes as brief as a paragraph or two - bit of text introducing the film. Generally speaking, entirely worthless.<br />Finally, each summary is followed by a half-hearted, and often too brief, attempt to examine the themes of the film and how Kubrick attempted to display those themes. Kagan manages to cut and paste portions of reviews that back his observations, but he rarely presents them in such a way to truly bolster his argument (or make the argument interesting for the reader), and for stretches one wonders just how much actual WRITING Kagan did. These thematic explorations are often so brief as to be frustrating, too. Barry Lyndon fans, for instance, will wonder if Kagan even SAW the film based on the two whole pages it gets.<br />In the end, however, the book fails because it offers the reader no real insight into the cinema of Stanley Kubrick. Not in the creation of these films; the production; the historicalimportance; the cinematic importance. Virtually nothing is offered on the history of these productions, how Kubrick went about creating each film, notes of interest, or reasons why the films stand out from the pack - things one would think are essential in a boom called \\"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick.\\"<br />So why two stars for a book so, well, bad? It is a valuable resource in that it summarizes some Kubrick films no longer readily available for viewing. Kubrick students may find some of use for this book in that, at least. Other than that:<br />SKIP THIS BOOK.	2004-01-11

Martin picks up where he left off on A Game Of Thrones (quite literally) and further expands his epic masterpiece. In this second volume, A Clash Of Kings, Martin again pits lords and ladies, armies and rogues, and warring factions against one another in a sprawling tale.<br />At some 970 pages and featuring a tremendous cast of characters, this tome is dense, maybe moreso than A Game Of Thrones. More subplots are thrown into the mix and more storylines are twisted together, expending the scope of the already massive tale. Like the first volume, Martin pulls this off by using fairly short, punchy chapters, each of which serves to move the plot forward and keep this otherwise hefty book moving along at a rapid pace.<br />That's not to say Martin doesn't stumble slightly here and there. Unlike A Game Of Thrones, which was the leanest 900-page book you'll ever read, not every page in A Clash Of Kings was vital. A few of the subplots are given too much time, developing over a longer period than they needed to, and otherwise serve only to slow the narrative. The lengthy looks at Theon Greyjoy's trials stand out in this regard. Also, several chapters appear to fill time rather than push the plot forward or offer an important revelation.<br />But these criticisms are minor and the instances when they stand out are few and far between. Martin weaves and twists plots as well as any, paints characters we can truly believe, and builds builds builds to a rousing, thrilling and surprising climax that is superior to the wrap up of volume one. All in all this installment lives up to the expectations set by the first. Lofty expectations indeed.<br />Without question George R.R. Martin has once again given readers one of the best fantasy novels to hit the bestseller list in a long, long time. Don't let the huge page counts and ongoing nature of the series fool you into thinking this is another Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind clone. Far from it. This is the best the genrehas to offer right now and is a must read for any fan of epic, gritty high fantasy.	2003-09-26

And based on the reviews of 9 and 10, I'm glad I did. After reading this book, I'm surprised people have stuck on for two more. After being enthralled with the story, I could not now care less about this tale's resolution. I won't be finishing this, and I don't mind a bit.<br />What was once a well-plotted, well-paced epic story with interesting characters and an intriguing (if dense) plot became by this volume (though it was starting to lean in this direction in the midst of volume 6) a plodding, directionless, dreary mess with little to grip the reader save increasingly bad characterization and prose that serves well enough when there is a plot worth reading but that is not at all pretty enough to warrant reading simply for the joy of nice words.<br />Or, to be brief: This book is boring.<br />Little happens. The characters are either portrayed badly or are simply annoying. The writing is less than good. The plot nonexistent.<br />Robert Jordan no longer feels the need to tie up plot threads, instead letting them dangle while throwing even MORE (uninteresting) threads out there, abandoning some subplots whole. The massive story that once moved with great agility now lumbers like a drunken beast. It's as if Jordan is stalling, figuring out where to go next. If at one point this series was plotted out and had direction, it no longer is and no longer does. It's clear Jordan is writing from the hip - and it doesn't work.<br />If you've gotten through the volumes before this but are unsure if you want to go on, I can only urge that you DON'T. And if you're a Jordan loyalist, well, we all know you'll assign five stars to whatever he puts out and insist it's masterful, so no need for advice to you.	2003-09-13

Martin's &quot;Song of Fire and Ice&quot; series is easily the best. With masterful prose, a twisting story that never finds rest, and characters that live and breathe, &quot;A Game Of Thrones&quot; sets into a motion a tale that will no doubt stand as a high point in modern fantasy.<br />Lovers of high fantasy; epic war stories; tales of royal intrigue; and character-based, plot-driven stories will not be disappointed by this story. Those looking for another &quot;young man goes on a quest&quot; or &quot;a dark lord is rising&quot; story, however, will be. Martin manages to throw away every modern fantasy cliche yet makes an eminently readable fantasy tale. There is little not to like here.<br />The cast of characters is huge, and Martin manages to make us believe them all. We hate them, we love them, we loathe them and we pity them. But most important of all, we BELIEVE them. The characters are consistent, complex and fascinating.<br />They're also in danger at every moment.<br />Martin, you see, has no qualms about killing off major characters. Moments of tension truly are tense because it is established very early on that main characters can and will die. And their deaths make sense, never played for shock value but rather serving the plot in a way that never feels forced, that follows what has come before, and that serves the narrative in a believable fashion.<br />And what an ever-changing narrative it is. If the title &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; sounds a bit like chess, certainly the plot looks like one, too. Viewpoints change with each chapter, and rarely is space wasted in this 800-page tome. Virtually every chapter reveals important information or, more times than not, sends the plot spinning in a new, unexpected (yet perfectly sensible and believable) direction. Martin teases you with obvious plot twists that never take place, then sends you reeling when you doubt the obvious only to have it actually happen. No, there is no predicting what will happen next ... and that is a great joy. The story keeps you on your toes.<br />The &quot;fantasy&quot; in this first volume is somewhat minimal, with some strange creatures, hints at others and a sparse bit of magic. Instead, the first book in this series is rooted with a grim tone of realism, a story about people good and evil in conflict, pushing and pulling over honor and power. It's a compelling and truly satisfying read.<br />There is no good reason for any lover of fantasy or medieval historical fiction to not own this.h obvious plot twists that never take place, then sends you reeling when you doubt the obvious only to have it actually happen.

That's exactly what he does here in Band of Brothers, which inspired the dazzling 10-hour HBO miniseries of the same name.<br />Crisp and fast-paced, Band of Brothers does not get as bogged down in detail his other best-known works WWII, D-Day and Citizen Soldier. For the researcher that may not be a good thing, but for the reader (especially the casual reader just looking for some WWII insight) it provides a good read that educates AND entertains. That's a valuable mix in bringing history to the masses.<br />Those who have read both Citizen Solider and D-Day might appreciate the brief dip back into Ambrose waters, but they might also be turned off by the anecdotes from those books repeated here. It appears much of the research that went into those books was also used for Band of Brothers. That's not to say there is nothing new here. There is. This is a book smaller in scope because the focus is on one company - Easy Company of the 101st Airborne.<br />Band of Brothers is a good, solid World War II read that should satisfy all save the most scholarly of WWII readers, who are better off avoiding this in lieu of a tome more dense with information. At its core, Band of Brothers is a book that allows a bunch of WWII vets to recount old war stories. And that makes for some enjoyable reading.	2003-07-07

This second novel takes  an interesting turn in the trilogy, regulating Ged to the supporting  cast.<br />The book is admittedly very slow starting, tooling along for  sometime before anything of interest steps up.  Finally, as Tenar (the  young girl who is the main character of this tale) begins exploring the  realm that is hers, the tale picks up.  As Ged finally makes his first  appearance, the magic of the rest of the trilogy shines through, pulling  the reader into the struggle with the dark ones, and of Ged and Tenars  oddly developing kinship.<br />A wonderful read that only shows itself at the  end, this is a fitting second book to a classic trilogy.	1999-07-01

Whereas the  original novels were laced with magic and wonder and a vast feel, this one  is smaller, more human, and more contained.  It is the story of our beloved  Tenar, from 'Tombs,' and of her struggles with motherhood, age, and with  being a woman.<br />As always, the prose is outstanding, flowing like poetry  throughout.  Tenar herself is far more flesh and blood than she was in her  first appearance, and Ged (who again plays a support role only) is  altogether another person, torn by his battles in the realm of the dead.   Still, the magic is missing, sapping the life from what could have been an  extraordinary book.<br />Had this not been Earthsea part 4, I would have rated  it higher...being among such lofty companions, however, it simply ends up  being a very good book, and little more.	1999-07-01

It is rich and beautiful, crafted with a skill and caring that modern fantasy  writers cannot match.<br />'The Two Towers' is the second book in this series,  and serves as a bridge from the initial tale of Frodo's flight from the  Shire and the Fellowship's journey to the huge scope of the larger war for  Middle Earth that is at hand.<br />Those readers with short attention spans  are not likely to enjoy the amazing depth with which Tolkien shapes his  world, nor are they likely to be able to tolerate a book that does not rely  solely on battles to advance the plot.  Those who adore epic adventure,  huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love*  this book.	1999-06-30

It is rich and beautiful, crafted with a  skill and likely to enjoy the amazing depth with which Tolkien shapes his  world, nor are they likely to be able to tolerate a book that does not rely  solely on battles to advance the plot.  Those who adore epic adventure,  huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love*  this book.<br />'The Fellowship of the Ring' starts things off wonderfully,  telling the tale of the ring, and giving the reader a feeling of how vast  and evil the story behind the ring is.  Frodo and his companion must endure  a series of adventures and encounters, trying to make their way out of the  Shire.  The first half of the book is very much reminicent of The Hobbit,  and picks up with the same spirit.<br />The second half of the novel gathers  together the party who will make the journey that is the center of the  series, and features one of the most famous and beloved parts of the series  - Moria.  Fantastic!<br />Recomended for all readers, young and old.  The only  ones likely to dislike this are readers spoiled by the cookie cutter style  of todays modern fantasy writers.	1999-06-30

Clarke is considered a master of science-fiction by so many not because of finely crafted fictional worlds or highly detailed alternate universes...no, he is beloved and respected because his stories of fiction  take place in *our world*.  They are highly believable in a very real world  way, because (by and large) Mr. Clarke's stories are grounded in the  scientific reality of their day and laced with speculative science that is  feasible in every regard.  You believe in his worlds because they are of  our world.<br />Arthur C. Clarke does not craft characters with rich depth, or  twisting plots that are overly complex - he creates simply stories of  discovery that delight and astoud, *without* seeming overly unbelievable.   Will your children get to live out the imagery of 2001?  Maybe, just  maybe...	1999-06-16

It's rather sad that our newest generation, weened on video games and bad movies, cannot relate to the bittersweet memories that Bradbury is able to so eloquently describe through the course of this novel.  This work is a  time capsule, a fragment of an innocent age lost when one grows up - and an  age that today's youths cannot grasp or understand.<br />The book itself is  written with a dazzling sense of rythmn and pacing, flowing more like  poetry than prose.  The stories themselves are like memories of events  you've never shared in, yet can relate to instinctively.  It's a masterwork  through and through, and is probably the best of Bradbury's vast library.   I heartily recomend this to anybody with a soul.	1999-06-11

A book to sit side by side with '1984' and 'Brave New World,' Bradbury's classic on censorship is less bleak in execution than 1984 and more focused than 'Brave New World,' resulting in a thoroughly readable tome that  remains as relevant today as it was years ago.  Not as good as '1984,' nor  as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning,  cynicism, and pure future paranoia.  Very nice.<br />You'll note, 9 out of 10  bed reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school  students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too  &quot;slow.&quot;  (i.e., not action-packed enough)  Rather ironic, when  looked at from a certain point of view...these narrow-minded, ignorant  little children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future, no?	1999-06-11

This  once enthralling series has grown stale and tired - it seems that the  &quot;path of saggers&quot; Robert Jordan speaks of is the one a person  must travel in order to trudge through this series.<br />(On a side note:   Being a bestseller does *not* equate quality.  Some nimrods may do  themselves well to learn this)	1999-06-11

'Animal Farm' is a fairy tale of sorts, a modern allegory on modern happenings, yet told in a fantastic and unbelievable way.  No, instead of political commentary or essays, or fiction that is apparent, Orwell chose  the realm of fantasy to make his points on Socialism and the human way.  Not sword and sorcery fantasy, but rather that classic mode of storytelling  that works so well, in which non-humans take up the role as humans, showing  us who we are while remaining distant from our image.  Facinating through  and through.<br />And you get all that in less than 100 pages.	1999-06-11
US	51220229	R2OA1WSVMS4FS3	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	2	3	N	N	An essential look at our inner darkness	There is a common theme to negative reviews of William Golding's classic meditation on power, anarchy, and human nature: They tend to come from disgruntled students forced to read the book for school. The complaints either suggest the book is too confusing and/or complicated -- far from the case; the narrative is very straightforward -- or that the book is implausible.<br /><br />But it's not.<br /><br />Rather than being implausible, what Lord of the Flies is, is disturbingly close to the mark when it comes to its look at our potential for evil and how quickly our tendency to exploit others rises to the fore when civilization is left behind.<br /><br />Still, who could blame them? They are struggling to understand themselves, and we expect them to absorb and understand what amounts to a rather dire essay on human nature? This is a harrowing tale about a group of lost youths, stranded and without guidance, whose fear and misunderstanding of the world (and each other) drive them to madness, and ultimately, murder ... far from a comfortable subject matter for young people still coming to understand their place in the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a short, cynical look into the human mind, and of the dangers that lie within us all.	1999-06-11

A Crown of Swords is a wonderful prelude to where this series is going (and has been headed for about 1,000 pages or so)...nowhere.<br />While not as utterly boring as Path of Daggers, Crown does not do much moving, save in  the later parts of the novel.  The character descriptions are the same as  the ones you have read before - the females are all still annoying, braids  are still tugged, ears are still boxed, and on and on.<br />Just make believe  that this is the last book in a tiring, stale series and drop it.	1999-05-26
