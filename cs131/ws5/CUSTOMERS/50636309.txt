Aurelius Augustinus 354-430 AD.<br />He was born in Thagesta in Numidia (North-Africa).The Confessions' has two parts. The first part is a kind of autobiography and the second part is a commentary to the first chapters of Genesis.<br />He taught rhetorics first in Carthago in Africa, later in Milan in Italy. But after a while he developed an aversion not only for rhetorics ( he began to consider it as useless and conceited and as a pool of sins ) but also for his fellow-man.<br />He began to show neurotic behaviour like having a fainting fit without apparent cause. It's for those reasons that psychologists like to study Augustine's Confessions.<br />As a result of his problems, Augustine became a Christian and he was one of the first to found a monastery. Later on he became bishop of Hippo in North-Africa.<br /><br />In the second part of 'The confessions', he tries to explain the first chapters of Genesis. ( This second part is very impressive and is the cause that \\"The Confessions\\" is in my personal top five of the best books I read during the last 30 years.)<br /><br />His plan was to comment on the whole Bible but he soon understood that this was an impossible task for one man.<br />Nevertheless he's is considered as the Father of modern Theology because of his comments.<br />To give two examples: When the Bible says that God created man to His image, Augustine explains that it means that man knows the difference between good and evil just like God does, it doesn't mean a physical resemblance.<br />Another interesting thought is about Creation. Creation is not limited in space and time: since God is everywhere, Creation is also everywhere and goes on till eternity.<br /><br />As conclusion I should mention that 'The Confessions'is also important because it is the first publication in Antiquity in which an author reveals his most inner feelings.	2005-10-09

'Description of the world' by Pomponius Mela, translated by F.E.Romer.<br /><br />The Description of the world, last translated into English over 400 years ago, is the earliest surviving geography book in Latin. Although it was first published at the height of the Roman Empire, in the mid-first century of this era, 'The Description of The World' circulated chiefly during Europe's great Age of Exploration. Pomponius Mela's work integrates geographical description with more familiar historical, cultural, and mythological information.<br /><br />Pomponius Mela knew of the Chinese and he reports geographical and cultural information about Sri Lanka and India, as well as Mediterranean and European places that are less remote to his experience. The outer edges of all the continents, including Europe, however, remained unfamiliar to the Romans. It is on the inhabited world's outer edges that the creatures of legend and mythology were believed to live.<br /><br />F.E.Romer's introduction assesses Pomponius Mela as a literary and geographic writer, while his translation follows the author's Latin style in accessible, modern English.<br />Pomponius Mela emerges as both a more engaging and a more consciously literary author than has generally been recognized.<br /><br />Romer's commentary clarifies specific ideas raised in the text. He also identifies and explains important issues and points the reader to ancient sources and modern works. This new study will intrigue students and teachers of ancient history, as well as historians, classicists and anyone interested in history of geography and education.	2005-10-03

I love this book because I often wonder if there are any boundaries to imagination ( The English scientist and SF writer Arthur C.Clark once said that the only way for travel into space is by imagination ).<br />Why the title The Crab Nebula ? Modern physics tells you that chaos rules the universe and if you can say one thing for sure about Crab: he is chaotic.<br /><br />This novel has no story. The Crab Nebula is comprised of fifty-two chapters that provide insights into the existence of this nebulous man named Crab.<br /><br />This novel explains the possible relationships between a writer and his character.<br />On the cover the publisher says: \\" A postmodernist novel par excellence, The Crab Nebula, parodies literary conventions, deconstructs narrative and meaning and brilliantly combines absurdity and hopelessness with irony and humor.\\"<br /><br />Yes, Crab is a very strange man. In fact he doesn't exist. Well maybe he exists but only through language. Language is the essence of his personality. But if language is his essence he can only exist in the mind of the writer.<br />You see, the writer is in control of everything: he invents his own laws of nature and logic, in his mind the Earth can be flat or square.<br /><br />He can toy with Crab as much as he likes, he can send Crab this way and at the same time the opposite way.<br />Therefore to us readers, Crab acts like a man who cannot make up his mind, he's a victim and an evildoer at the same time.<br /><br />When you read this novel you have to keep one thing in mind and one thing only: language and imagination are in control	2005-07-28

Only one good piece of advice; don't buy this book if you expect a collection of horror stories. It's a history of human intellectual behaviour and a study of the different ways we look at our surroundings, from the late 15th century until the 1700's.<br />In 1438 a pig was hanged for murder in Burgundy. The French judge Henri Boguet described an apple possessed by demons in 1602. A few years later, Italian Jesuits tried to calculate the physical dimensions of hell.<br /><br />These and many other ideas from the late Middle Ages and the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries seem absurd today, but they made good sense to people at the time. This book explains how beliefs that are strange to us were once widely accepted. It sets out the intellectual world of men and women in the distant past, and shows how their assumptions and expectations allowed them to believe things that we cannot: that heresy and witchcraft posed a threat to society, that demons carried people through the air and that the dead occasionally walked away from their graves.<br /><br />None of these ideas were mad. They simply reflected the belief system of the medieval and Renaissance world. In fact an understanding of the rational basis of beliefs that now seem absurd suggests that modern ideas may one day seem equally ridiculous.<br /><br />The reason why I like this book so much is because it compels you to study your own way of thinking but you won't be able to do that without a sense of humor	2005-05-20

In the introduction Paul Shore explains that most books written in Antiquity deal with men. Women and children are ignored (besides a few exceptions). With inscriptions it's a different matter. Thanks to the widespread of litteracy in the Roman empire many 'common' folk wrote inscriptions on walls (the early graffity), on tombstones and on tablets in temples. They tell something about everyday life like in this excerpt of A Charioteers' Grave (P.Shore gives the entire translation):<br /><br />We the members of his team 'Veneta',<br /><br />Dedicate this altar to Fuscus,<br /><br />...<br /><br />Unblemished fame was yours.<br /><br />You earned the praise of the race course<br /><br />As you strove with many, fearing none,<br /><br />...<br /><br />There were also more 'philosophical' inscriptions like this one:<br /><br />What are we<br /><br />Or what do we say<br /><br />At last this life is?<br /><br />Just that a man has<br /><br />Lived among us<br /><br />And now is no more.<br /><br />Just the stone<br /><br />And the inscription remain,<br /><br />And no other traces.<br /><br />Now what<br /><br />Is life?<br /><br />It is nothing that<br /><br />You should trouble yourself<br /><br />To inquire about.<br /><br />There are also thirteen black and white photo's of tombstones.

For 300 pages you think you're reading a SF novel and it's only in the last 13 pages that you become aware of the fact that all along it was mainly about psychology. The SF elements are only the background for this novel.<br /><br />The two main characters are Bob, his full name is Robinette Broadhead, and Sigfrid, a psychotherapist.<br />Bob, a poor devil who wins the lottery, is finally able to leave the Earth ( or at least what is left of the habitable part of it ) for an asteroid named Gateway. Gateway has a complex of tunnels digged by the Heechee, an alien civilization that vanished half a million years ago. A part of their spacecrafts - still intact - are left behind on Gateway. They still can be used by humans for exploration of the universe. You don't need a special training because the ships are almost entirely automatic. You can earn a lot of money when you make a new discovery - an unknown star or a new planet in an other solar system, or when you find signs of alien intelligent life and things like that. You have to come back alife of course and that's the tricky part.<br />The second character is Sigfrid, a robot-psychologist. What can you say about a robot ? I guess Sigfrid is like any other psychologist ( OK, bad joke, forget it ).<br /><br />Now what's the problem with Bob ? In his last discovery voyage something nasty happens. He's the only one of his crew who gets away. The others are still alive and well but something very odd happened to them. Bob is feeling very guilty about it hence his weekly visits to Sigfrid.<br />The last 13 pages are very emotional.	2005-04-14

For example a large corridor in a modern building has several garlands of light against one wall, or strings of white lights attached to the ceiling and pouring down like rain to the floor to form a pool of light.<br /><br />If you want to know all about Gonzales and his different forms of art, please read the fascinating<br /><br />book \\" Felix Gonzales-Torres \\" by William Bartsman and others.	2005-04-13

Athenaeus lived in the third century A.C. and was born in Naucratis in Egypt. His 'Dipnosophistae' (Banquet of Scholars) is not complete anymore but we have extensive summaries of this work.<br /><br /> There are thirty scholars at the banquet and each tells about a subject which is his speciality. To name a few of these subjects: antiquities (already at that time!),art,literature,gastronomy,etc. One of the main subjects is gastronomy (not something scholars are used to talk about but this is a banquet after all).<br /><br />In this work are a lot of excerpts from different authors we would not know about without Athenaeus.For instance several poems of Sappho are only known because they are cited in this work of Athenaeus. Another topic is travelling (A hazardous enterprise in those days even on the Roman 'speedways').<br /><br />In one of those travel stories, a large Roman ship, built for the transport of corn, is described in detail. We read for example about the facilities for the representative of Hiero (Hiero is the owner of the ship and is to busy to travel himself). These facilities were big enough for fifteen places to sleep and was divided in three large cabins. A galley - only for this representative and his family or friends - was located at the stern. Each cabin had a mosaic on the floor showing scenes from the Iliad. (Can you imagine? Such a passenger facility on a cargo ship!).<br /><br />All this is very interesting but sometimes you have to read twenty tedious pages or more to read finally one interesting page.

In spite of it's modest dimensions and only 216 pages, this book gives a rather exhaustive account of Etruscan art.It goes from well known art like the bronze Chimaera from Arezzo to a multitude of votive human terracotta heads (meant as offerings or gifts in temples).  Discussing Etruscan art deals with mainly two problems. There are for example a number of wall paintings and decorated vases showing athletes performing their discipline. Since there survived several kinds of lists but no literature at all, we don't know if the Etruscans knew events like for instance the games of Olympia in Greece. There is nothing or very little known about their sociological structure. Moreover there are no archaeological sites with a stadium (or at least the foundations of it). Therefore, those wall paintings of athletes could also be regarded as imagination of the artist.<br /><br />Another problem is the originality of Etruscan art. Many say that they were only capable of imitating Greek and Eastern examples. Nigel Spivey proves that the Etruscans had a high level of original art in spite of those cosmopolitan influences.

He was a travelling orator. In those days people liked to listen to the witful language skills of those orators. Their speeches served no purpose, it was only meant to show off and to amuse.  Besides his work as an orator, Lucian wrote a lot of 'Dialogues' or 'Satires', a kind of conversation in which he mocked several aspects of the society in those days. The most famous are 'Dialogues of the Gods', 'Dialogues of the Dead' and 'Dialogues of the courtesans'.<br /><br /> One of my favourite satires is 'The judgement of Paris'(from Dialogues of the Gods). Athena, Hera and Aphrodite want Paris to decide which of them is the most beautiful goddess. In the manners of a real beauty contest, the three goddesses try to sell their merchandise to Paris.

So you can judge by yourself if it is interesting enough.<br /><br />I<br /><br />The first poet is Archilochos. He lived in the seventh century B.C. He was born on the island of Paros, one of the cyclades. He left it for good when he became a mercenary.<br /><br />He was at his best as a satirist. His work came to us in fragments (like for many poets in this collection).<br /><br />(# 36)<br /><br />\\"He comes in bed,<br /><br />As copiously as<br /><br />A Prilnian ass<br /><br />And is equipped<br /><br />Like a stallion.\\"<br /><br />II<br /><br />Sappho!

US	50636309	R30BLNEOV4GW5D	0312311109	940505853	Achilles: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Achilles and his mother.	There are two kinds of novels about Antiquity: the historical novels like 'Quo Vadis' and 'I, Claudius' and novels about a character from mythology. I prefer the latter because there is more room for fantasy and imagination. In the 1970's the German writer Christa Wolf wrote some outstanding novels about mythology like 'Medea' and 'Cassandra'(the latter translated in English).<br /><br />And now there is 'Achilles' by Elisabeth Cook.<br />It's a willful and sensual novel  about Achilles, one of the Greek commanders who besieged Troy. Peleus, his mortal father, begets him with Thetis, a sea-goddess. (A whole chapter is used to describe a fierce and erotic battle between a common man and an immortal woman - it's not very likely he should win but he does).<br /><br />When Achilles was born, Thetis washed him in the river Styx, which made him invulnerable except for a spot at his heel where his mother held him. (Near the end of the Trojan war, Paris kills Achilles by shooting an arrow in his heel). E.Cook gives a personal interpretation about Achilles'heel: she explains why it's the fault of his father instead of Thetis' fault.('Blame it on the father!', I've heard it before). It are these things that make the novel worthwile reading: it's not the mythological story-almost everybody knows it-but the descriptions, events and interpretations imagined by E.Cook. One of the highlights of this story is the description of the Trojan river ( or river-god if you like ) Skamander who tries in vain to drown Achilles.<br /><br />In the last part of the novel, the poet John Keats makes his appearance. Achilles and John Keats had both red hair it seems, but that's not enough to explain the appearance of a completely superfluous personage.<br />Though Keats spoils the fun a little (he's so out of place!) it's a novel interesting enough for those who like Antiquity as the background of a story.	2005-04-12

This novel is about the way people (children and adults) are trying to cope with religious fanaticism. Above all it shows how the credulity of children is exploited by parents and other family members for the sake of their own fanatic ideas.<br />The main characters are Tarwater, a fourteen year old boy, who lives with his great-uncle in a cottage in the woods. There is Rayber, the schoolteacher, who's Tarwater's uncle. Bishop, the severe mentally disabled son of Rayber, is one of the most touching characters of the novel.<br /><br />When the great-uncle dies of old age at the breakfast table, the boy puts the cottage on fire and runs off. After a while he decides to go to his uncle Rayber who tries to win the friendship of his nephew.<br />Though the intrigue is fairly simple it's sometimes a tragedy so dense that - at certain moments - it's almost unbearable to read further. It leaves the reader almost with a feeling that all the misery of the world has landed upon his shoulders. Only after a few moments he can fool himself by saying that it's only fiction, so why worry.	2005-04-12

More or less 150 years after Homer's Iliad, Sappho lived on the island of Lesbos west off the coast what is present Turkey. (Due to political upheavel she went two times in exile, the second time to Sicily for a short time ).<br /><br />Sappho takes a special place among the poets of Antiquity. She was already famous in her own time. Plato said that she was the tenth Muse and someone called her poetry \\" as refreshing as a morning breeze \\". Her poems are vivid and she needs only a few words to describe essential human feelings. She calls solitude for instance \\" this icy numbness of being alone \\".<br /><br />( Nice to know: from Sappho's poems remain about 500 lines. All Tragedies by Aeschylus have a total of 8144 lines. Conclusion: What's left of Sappho's poems is next to nothing. )<br /><br />\\" Wedding of Andromache \\" is one of the most vivid descriptions in the poetry of Antiquity. It gives an almost journalistic account of the homecoming of Hector and Andromache. A fragment of Barnstone's translation:<br /><br />\\" ...<br /><br />and all set out for Troy<br /><br />in a confusion  of sweet-voiced flutes, citharas,<br /><br />and small crashing cymbals<br /><br />and young girls sang a loud heavenly song<br /><br />...\\"<br /><br />Sappho excels also in describing landscapes and nature ( something you don't find often in Ancient literature ). A fragment of \\" Aphrodite of the flowers \\",<br /><br />\\"...<br /><br />Here ice water babbles through the apple branches<br /><br />and roses leave shadow on the ground<br /><br />...\\"<br /><br />This translation was published in 1998 but as a work of art in itself, it's by no means outdated.	2005-04-12

At first sight you could call this a SF novel with the classical ingredients. Something happened: a nuclear war? an accident with a biological weapon? Anyway it seems that public live has ceased to exist. There is no electricity, no TV or radio and everyone seems to have gone.<br /><br />Two young sisters, who lost their parents, live in a cottage deep in the woods of North-California. As a result of what happened they're cut off completely until one day a young man comes to their house and he stays for a while. After he's gone, the two sisters gradually change into a more 'primitive' way of life with a different perception (more elaborated as time goes by) of their surroundings. (To some degree, it reminds me of the novel 'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding).<br /><br />But when you think it over, you could say it's a parable about growing up. The arrival of the young man drives them out of the 'Paradise' of their childhood and this starts the process of growing up. They don't turn into 'primitive' humans, they only lose their innocence. They become more mature and finally venture out of their cottage where they used to live for so long.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if there were other interpretations. It's a characteristic of masterworks to be interpreted in different ways	2005-04-11

I hope that those who read my review will forgive me because I would like to talk mainly about Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. When I read the Odyssey for the first time, I thought it was a wonderful adventure book with beautiful and dangerous women and I laughed with that half-wit of a Polyphemus, one of the cyclops. But near the end something was missing, it was not what it should be. Odysseus came home. His son Telemachus and his swineherd were glad and his dog could finally die with the comforting knowledge that it's master was among the living. Why didn't Penelope make a joyful sound ? Why was she so silent ? I shrugged my shoulders and said:'women!'. It's only years later I began to understand a little. So many people died in the Trojan war. The many adorers of Penelope were slaughtered by Odysseus with no compassion at all. The silence of Penelope was a reproachful silence. She was wondering how many more dead people it would take before men could live in peace. We still ask that question.	2005-04-11

The contents of this book is only a small portion of what is called the Greek Anthology which consists in about 4000 Greek epigrams (short poems) from the period approximately 600 BC - 600 AC. They are collected for the first time in a manuscript of the 13th century.This work is divided in sixteen books each with a different subject.You don't have to read all 4000 epigrams, you just chose a book with a subject you like. The most popular are book V about love, book VII about death and funeral, book XI about Bacchus and satires and book XIV with problems, riddles and oracles.<br /><br /> You can learn a great deal about daily life in Antiquity just by reading these short poems (some of them no more than two lines). We read about prostitutes and courtisanes, sailors and fishermen and-for example-about three girls, shy and giggling, offering flowers to the statue of Aphrodite, goddess of Love. If you don't like the rigid books like 'Daily life in Ancient Rome', buy a book with poems of the Greek Anthology.	2005-04-11

In 1995 he won the David Cohen British Literature Prize, awarded for a lifetime's achievement in literature.<br /><br />On 30 May 1960, the play was presented by Michael Codron and David Hall at the Duchess Theatre, London, with the following cast:<br />Mick, a man in his late twenties: Alan Bates<br />Aston, a man in his early thirties: Peter Woodthorpe<br />Davies, an old man: Donald Pleasance<br /><br />This is the story of three men. Mick is the proprietor of a shabby house in West London. Aston, his brother, is always busy with something but never accomplishes anything. Finally there is Davies, some kind of a hobo, adopted by Aston who gives him a place to sleep and - after a while - asks him if he wants a job as the caretaker. Davies is very reluctant and finds petty excuses to postpone the decision of becoming the caretaker.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, you ask yourself if anything will ever change and if anything important will ever happen ('No Exit' by J.P.Sartre comes to mind: four persons who will have to suffer each other for Eternity).<br /><br />The most impressive part of the play is the monologue by Aston in which he tells how he was treated with electro-shocks when he was a kid. This is one of the most gruesome parts I know in modern theatre.<br /><br />A final remark: when you read (or listen to) this play, you will soon find out that one of the most attractive parts of this play is the very lively and humorous dialogue	2005-04-11

Anna Blume, a young woman, is searching for her brother who disappeared ( a letter is the last sign of life from her brother ). It brings her to a country unknown and without a name. Apparently terrible things happened not so long ago. The people there have to live in poverty and hardship with a never ending struggle with all sorts of criminals.<br />At first sight this book has some things in common with a SF novel. Something very bad happened, civilization is almost gone. But is Paul Auster really a writer to use science-fiction ? He writes about coincidence, about the intertwining of fiction and reality and about individuals in relation to their relatives ( as is the case with Anna Blume ). The ( coincidental ) meeting with the father is one of the most returning subjects.<br />Why would such a writer use science fiction ?<br /><br />Who knows better than Paul Auster himself ? In an interview with L.McCaffery and S.Gregory ( The Red Notebook and other writings - edition Faber & Faber - London ) he says (about The Country of Last Things) that there are specific references to the Warsaw ghetto but also to events taking place in the Third World today and that New York is turning into a Third World city ( again: according to Paul Auster ).<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned I think that everyone has the right to interpret this novel as he/she wants.<br />I like this novel because Anna Blume is a brave and touching character in search for her brother.	2005-03-08

The quarrel is about<br />a girl. Her name is Briseis, one of the slaves. Agamemnon took her away from Achilles.<br /><br />In doing so, Homerus creates a parallel with Menelaos - one of the greek commanders- who lost his wife because Paris took her to Troy.<br />Instead of a war poem Homerus tells us the coming of age of Achilles.<br /><br />In the beginning he's like a whining child making a quarrel with Agamemnon over a girl. He refuses to send his troops into the battle. But when things are going bad for the Greeks, some of the warlords go to the tent of Achilles and implore him to participate in the battle.He refuses but agrees that his friend Patroclus leads his troops to battle. ( It's noteworthy that Agamemnon plays second fiddle to Achilles from start to finish.)<br /><br />When Hector - a Trojan commander - kills Patroclus, Achilles grieves for a long time and he finally understands that in a war there are no victors only losers. He becomes a man with understanding and compassion for the grief of others, even for his enemy. He has come a long way since his childish whining for Briseis.	2003-09-19
