I read all of the reviews and totally agree that this Sister has incredible writing skills.  But I was totally surprised that not one reviewer made us aware that she is definitely a triple threat.  1.  She is an awesome lyricist; 2.  She is a poet's poetress and 3.  A hellified author.<br /><br />I re-read page 136 over and over again.  \\"Business Card \\" is incredible, and since I am a hopeless romantic, I picked the second ending as my favorite.  I couldn't get enough of Tremel's last poem; Ump, Ump Ump!.  The way Trista used the first letter of each word to end up telling us how much of a man Tremel is, just blew this reader away.<br /><br />I would advise anyone that has not picked up this book yet, to do so right away and not only read it, but keep it for your permanent library.<br /><br />I sincerely hope this is not the last we hear from this author; that would be a terrible shame and a great loss.  I have no doubt that this author will hold her own in any genre she would choose to write - romance, mystery, etc.	2005-10-10

Until I had read the works of Ms. Dorce-Coupet, I believed that Zane was the best in this genre called &quot;romantic/erotica&quot;.<br />I now have to re-think that assessment.  Ms. D-C holds the title hands down.<br />She magnetically drawns you into the illicit world of Erin and Danyel.  Making you a willing captive in the web she weaves; literally have you cheering for romance that everything you've ever been taught deems wrong, both morally and bibically.<br />Danyel and Erin will dance upon the stage of your emotions long after you've read the last punctuation mark and will not release you even when you re-read chapter after chapter after chapter.  Ms. D-C will take you through caverns of emotions.  She will take you to the heights of heaven, only to drop you in the basement of despair.  You actually can feel the torment of these two characters, sometimes cheering them on individually and separately.  The many twists and turns Ms. D-C involves you in will have your breathing erratic; and at times will even cut off your air.<br />I cannot think of enough positive adjectives to have you know the depth of her writings.  I think the Queen will wear her crown for years to come.  The $26 plus is well worth it.  No matter what the cost of the sequel &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot;, I will have it in my library.<br />Some people are born to write, Ms. D-C surpasses her birthright.<br />May you be blessed to finish the sequel.<br />ALL HAIL THE QUEEN!!!!!!!	2004-01-01

And that's the only way our protagonist, Georgette Willis, will get any help in the situation brewing in this cauldron of romance decisions.  It will definitely have to be through divine intervention.  The only thing she  can do is lift up her eyes until the hills from which cometh her  help.<br />This books' plot revolves around the choices and decisions which go  into looking for that special someone.  Will she go for the money or the  love?  Blue collar vs. white collar lovin!  And what choices they are.  As  far as I am concerned, our heroine is between a rock and a hard  place.<br />Let me use an ole popular song to introduce you into the dilemma  our heroine finds herself engulfed with.  The very appropriate song that  comes to this reviewer's mind is &quot;I've Got Two Lovers&quot; by Mary  Wells.  Anybody out there remember that one?  Remember what Mary had to say  about the differences between her two men?  Let me refresh your  memory.<br />One Lover was sweet and kind, while the other treated her bad,  made her sad and made her cry.<br />Ray Fushee (blue collar lover) is one of  the lovers in Mary's song and Gerard Jenkins (white collar lover) is the  other.  You would think the choice would be very easy, take the one what  treats you so good right?  Wrong!  Girls, girls, girls, both of them are  superfine, job holding, disease free, commitment making black men.  It is  the way these brothas make their commitments that puts my girl Georgette in  a tailspin, and will have your toes curling long after you finish reading  this book.  Ray does his thing on page 254 and I immediately said, I'll  take him!  Then Gerard committed on page 258, and I had to stop and take  several gulfs of air before I could continue.  Lord, Lord, Lord, what's a  girl to do?<br />I must warn you though.  Before you start reading, bridle  your romance ticking heart muscle, because the twists and turns that bring  about Georgette's decision will have it doing constant flip flops and at  times literally forgetting its function to your body.  I literally had to  restrain my itchy fingers several times not to flip to the end to see what  happened.  But I held out, but at what cost.<br />But guess what Yawl?  There  is also a beautiful love story going on between Melinda, Georgette's best  friend and her ex love.  I can't rave enough about this book.  And as if  this book is not good enough, we have plenty of wisdom through biblical  quotations.  This book has it all and is definitely a keepa to be read  again and again.<br />Ms. Gilmore has the astounding writing ability which  flows like the lingo of our people; free, easy, passionate and uninhibited.  Her writing inspires the sort of release you receive when you've walked  all day in shoes that are too tight and you finally get home and slip into  those broken down comfortable house shoes.  She just brings in tranquility  with the essence of her speech.  She's us Yawl!  At our best!  Try her,  I'm sure you'll agree!d at  times literally forgetting its function to your body.

Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Reading of &quot;Until&quot; Promotes Entrance of Dreamwalkers&quot;	That's what it took Yawl for this reviewer to interpret the literary genius of Timmothy B. McCann.<br />It took the characters of Betty Robinson, Jacqui Jordan, Evander Jones and Andrew Patrick Staley to descend into the  bowels of my emotions to raise my level of understanding to recognize the  importance of what this author has to say.<br />Let me try to explain.<br />I  read Until in one sitting, which kept me up well into the midnight hour,  and as I slipped into sleep Mr. McCann's characters related their story to  me as each one performed their individual tap dance on the essence of my  soul.<br />Listen, as they introduce themselves to you as well:<br />Our heroine,  Betty Robinson, is not only beautiful, educated and caring, but fully  proves to us as a people, what we do every day on the stage of life - take  the blackness of negativity and ride it until we erupt into our inheritance  of light. Betty's light was her becoming a brillant trial attorney and  helping others to enter into what she had attained - confidence and  self-respect.<br />Jacqui Jordan, Betty's best friend, proves herself to be  just that, time and time again. Jacqui is the epitome of true friendship -  she is willing to sacrifice your feelings with her often hurtful bluntness  in order to save you from outside hurtful forces.  In other words, she  doesn't feed into telling you what you want to hear, but what you need to  hear in order to keep on keepin on in a positive way.  The accumulation of  her learning drips like pearls of wisdom throughout this book.  I enjoyed  her character the most of all.<br />Evander Jones - Umph, Umph, Umph!  He's  the type of man who will have you believing water ain't wet, and have us  foolish women rejoicing in what we consider newfound knowledge - that is  until the icy tenacles of its coldness renders us senseless as it catapults  us back into the world of reality; awakening us from the hypocrisy of the  beliefs he instills in us!  The development of his character is superb.  He'll have you double re-thinking any decisions you make in the romance  arena of your life.<br />Then finally, we have Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Patrick  Staley, entrepreneur extraordinaire.  He is the kind of man prayers are  sent forth for - tall, dark, handsome, intelligent and caring. He defines  what we mamas want for our daughters.  You see, Drew's beauty radiates from  the inside out.  His beauty lies not in his physical attributes, as I'm  sure Mr. McCann meant us to deduce.<br />Well Yawl, therein lies the telling  of this tale.<br />This reviewer highly recommends that you get this book,  contemplate on it, feast on it and then bring others to the feast by your  positive recommendation of the reading of this book.  If for no other  reason, you should buy this book in order to get a picture of the  &quot;hunk&quot; on the cover.

Ms. Jackson has certainly given us a winner in this beautiful tale of love in the life of a &quot;meat and potatoes kind of woman&quot;.<br />Dr. Steve Reynolds is the beholder and Carmel Matthews is the recipient of his  admiration.<br />The main ingredient of this story involves the powerful  attraction that a super fine plastic surgeon develops for a super fine,  alebeit a size 20, registered nurse whom he's hired to care for his ailing,  cantankerous father, Dr. Marvin Reynolds.<br />Though young Dr. Reynolds has a  strong physical attraction to Carmel,and even goes as far as to ENERGICALLY  prove it behind closed doors, a sort of &quot;the proof is in the  puddin&quot; sort of action, he still has to deal with his own inner issues  which will allow that physical attraction to transcend beyond the  boundaries of society's definition of beauty; that which speaks of beauty  beginning and ending in a size 10 or less.<br />This author allows us to take  a ride on the highs and lows of our imaginations as to how this situation  will end.<br />Ms. Jackson not only paints a great storyline with our  principal characters, &quot;young&quot; Dr. Reynolds and Carmel, but the  byplay she creates between Carmel and &quot;ole&quot; Doc. Reynolds is a  story that can stand on its own merits as a novel that would be worth  reading ova and ova again. Get ready to have some gut wrenching laughs as  the relationship between these two characters develops.  Especially when  Carmel deals with &quot;ole&quot; doc's EX.  Have tissues for the tears of  laughter you won't be able to keep from flowing! Also have some snacks  handy, so you won't have to interrupt your reading to run to the kitchen  when Carmel throws down in the kitchen!<br />This is a good one Yall, worthy  of adding to your &quot;keeper's&quot; library.<br />Needless to say, I've  already ordered her other four books, and I am looking forward to reading  the same degree of excellence as she has displayed in this perception of  &quot;The Look of Love.&quot;ption of  &quot;The Look of Love.&quot;	2000-06-04

During this time, he met, married and conceived a baby  girl with a beautiful African model.<br />It is his desire to protect his  offspring from a deranged grandfather that propels Nat back into the life  of Jenine Jones.  Though his desire was to protect his child, he discovers  that the desire he felt for Jenine years back has never really diminished.  And therein lies the spinning of this tale.  Ms. Walker does a great job in  supplying us not only with intrigue, danger, mystery, but the development  of the romance angle is outstanding.<br />The sexual tension and final  fulfillment will have your toes curling and looking forward to reading more  from this author.<br />Another good one!

She  is so incensed at this knowledge that she devises a plan to bring the  Congressman down.<br />Brent Stevens, the Congressman's Administrative  Assistant is the instrument Kara initially uses to bring her plan of  revenge into play.  But she didn't figure on falling for the prey she had  set up.<br />The stage is set and he web begins when Kara meets Brent at a  party and passes herself off as an easy &quot;woman of the night.&quot;  This in itself goes against the grain of Kara's upbringing.  Her mother had  provided an environment of the strictest religious edits,in which romance  of the soul was a definite no no.<br />Though the sexual tension was quite  evident in this first meeting, the fulfillment was not to be.  Kara  accomplished her goal if stealing papers from Brent that would be  detrimental to his employer (Congressman Eastman) if they should ever  become public.<br />Now the roller coaster of deceit really gets started.  But  the ride would take Kara on many unanticipated adventures.<br />Now the net  of deceit must expand to include meetings between Kara and her siblings  Jenny and Dante.

Because the book I read does not generate the same amount of satisfaction that the other 3 reviewers obviously achieved.<br />Now romance readers, both new to the block and seasoned, we all know that romance novels usually  follow the same format:  boy/girl meets boy/girl, resist temptation to get  together; get together, and live happily ever after (or something close to  the affect).  The difference that makes the story a good or bad one is  simply the individual author's spin on telling the tale.<br />Ms. Keaton  definitely missed the boat in her telling of the tale.<br />Her writing leaves  this reviewer totally lifeless and a deep feelin of emptiness.<br />Now I'm  sure some will agree that sometimes romance novels/novelists lets us travel  to realms beyond the statosphere in which we normally reside, but in  reading this author's work, my feet never left the launch pad.  The theme  was good, but the foundational building on that theme is startlingly  absent.  The heroine had me rooting that the man who had targeted her to be  the object of his affections would give up and find someone else, possibly  in a book which Ms. Robyn Williams or Ms. Kathleen Cross or Ms. Bette Ford  had written.<br />I'm still searching for the great read I expected to get by  the purchase of this book.  Obviously, it, like the author's delivery of  this written word, has not arrived.<br />And, believe you me, I am certainly  not going to purchase any more books written by Ms. Keaton to find out if  it ever arrives.

To some, that is implicit.  For others, this  is the breakdown.  Ashela went through hell, but like cream she rose to the  top.  And what a rise it is!<br />Though you will share many adventures with  Ashela, wait until you see her solution to the problem that confronts her  in the form of finding out that her man has been cheating while previously  being completely monogamous with her for almost two years.

His  is truly a story of  a journey from rags to super duper riches.  Surely  Yall have heard the saying &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;?  Well,  Sam's initial reaction to Ashela was like that.  The love that Ms. Williams  creates between these two peole - both in and out of bed - cannot and has  not been surpassed.  The previous record of a torrid love scene was  previously held by Rochelle Alers in her book &quot;Happily Ever  After&quot; (7 pages).  Ms. Williams now holds the record with 8 pages.  (Ms. Alers included hers in paperback; but Ms. Williams was in hardcover  with twice the amount of words per page).<br />Sam and Ashela display their  love in various places, positons and postures (and what a variety they  are! )  These scenes will have you continually reading with your mouth  gaped wide open!  I'm still trying to keep mine closed when I just think  about them!<br />But guess what Yall? There's a dark side to Sam's love.  He  takes the saying &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&quot; and  rightfully places it where it belongs - smack dab in the middle of the  &quot;Male&quot; gender's ballpark.  Wait til you read how Mr. Ross reacts  when he wrongfully comes to the conclusion that Ashela has defected from  his &quot;love camp&quot;.

About the only thing I agree about with the other reviewers is the essence of the book, which is:  Young woman in need  of financial assistance to complete her MBA accepts the challenge of doing  a prominent family's family tree, with much chagrin to them.<br />Now when I  first began to read this book, I was thrilled.  And the more pages I read,  the more excited I became.  But somewhere down the line, I became  frustrated with this author's handling of the story.<br />Now we know the  heroine, Sydney Tanner had issues dating back to her childhood upbringing  because we were repeatedly reminded of them in abstact flashbacks to that  period in her life.  At first, it was ok, but then the flashbacks became  distracting.<br />Sydney got on my very last nerve with her &quot;should I  allow myself to fall in love or should I not&quot; attitude. I found myself  practically screaming for her to get on with it!  It just became too much.  I found myself reading super fast to get through with the book due to  frustration and not because it did so much for me.<br />I sense an  undercurrent of greatness which is lurking just below the surface of Ms.  Winters.  When that current erupts, watch out!  This woman will be  dynamite.  But this book didn't display that to me.<br />Although this book  will not be one I will keep to read again, I do not regret buying it nor  will it deter me from buying another one of her books.  Maybe I'll see that  greatness erupt in one of her other books.<br />Don't get mad at me, I just  call them like I see them!	2000-05-22

I still get weepy  thinking about the restaurant scene where she lays out everything to Gerald  - and in the presence of his girlfriend! Ms. Larence has written an ending  that surpasses all endings.  You'll never guess.<br />I won't say another  word.  Experience it yourself.  Needless to say, I went online and  ordered everything Ms. Larence has written.  I have some catch up to do,  because this is her third novel.  I hope you take my advice to buy this  woman's books, she will have your emotions tied up in knots!	2000-05-15

Mr. White makes us face issues that  we'd rather not tackle when reading for pleasure.  The issues he  successfully makes us look at are embodied in the lives of the Richardson  family, mainly Sid, Leandra and Kahlil.<br />The word &quot;deceit&quot;, in  its highest level of ugliness ties these three together.  Sid, a young man  growing up in the world without a father - when he doesn't have to - but  the deceit perpetrated by his mother makes fatherlessness a reality for  him.  Leandra, Sid's mother, places a blemish on black motherhood, with the  height of her deceit.  Then we have Kahlil, a &quot;strong black man&quot;,  working against seemingly insurmountable odds to keep the unity of the  Black family in tact.<br />Then we have a subordinate character by the name of  Kelly who Mr. White uses to bring our blood to a boil.  This woman takes  the definition of the word &quot;skank&quot; to another level.  Wait until  you read about her deceit directed againt her best friend, all in the name  of love (so she says).<br />Romance readers, take heart, this book offers us a  little love on the side also, but it is its tenacious assault on our  fragile emotions that makes this book a keeper.  There is also some humour  for us also.  Wait until you read the part where Sid reacts to a man his  mother has put up to pretending to be his father.<br />I've already ordered  my copy of &quot;Cup of Love.&quot;  I hope that maybe, just maybe, Mr.  White will allow me put back on my &quot;rose tinted&quot; glassees for  this reading.<br />If not, I'm still a fan!<br />My parting thought on this  book:  &quot;Even within the constraining boundaries of depressive issues,  this author has proven himself to be magnificient.&quot;, Mr.  White will allow me put back on my &quot;rose tinted&quot; glassees for  this reading.<br />If not, I'm still a fan! <br />My parting thought on this  book:  &quot;Even within the constraining boundaries of depressive issues,  this author has proven himself to be magnificient.&quot;	2000-05-10

LET ME COUNT THE WAYS!&quot;	And baby, you need a calculator to keep up with the numerousways our hero, Myles Moore, lets the heroine - Marisa Marrero knowjust how deep his love... goes!  Let me share with you just some of the ways this brotha goes to prove his love: Washing and braiding her hair while kissing each part he makes; cooking for her after a long days work coupled with with a massage; loosing his own self-respect while allowing her to keep hers; accepting a position of one sided loving.<br />Girls, this man evokes a lot of feelings.  First of all if, I was his Mama, I'd whop his behind for being such a wimp, but if I had daughters waiting to be married off, I would ask the Lord to order their steps to find this man, then again if I was a man, I'd ridicule this man to no end.<br />But no matter what side of the coin you come down on, you'll have to admit that Marcus Major knows how to spin a tale and having you loving and looking forward to each chapter.<br />This book is definitely worth picking up and reading.<br />...changed my mind about men writing love scenes.  I've read Eric Jerome Dickey, Omar Tyree, Louis Jourdan, James Earl Hardy and E.  Lynn Harris, and had come to the conclusion that the men writers could not touch the women when it comes to creating an erotic bed room scene.  It's as if they could give chase to the &quot;booty&quot;, but could not describe the attainment (both Mr. Harris and Mr. Hardy excluded from this assessment).<br />There's some funny moments created in this book in the person of Amir, he's the brother of Myles.  His advice concerning &quot;affairs of the heart&quot; were really good EXCEPT how he advised someone on how to handle the situation when you're caught between two women you're dating.  But the true nature of Mr. Majors comes out when he brings into question if that is the proper and only way to handle the situation.<br />Readers, take my advice and get your copy of this book as quickly as possible.  This young man can only get better if this is how he approaches his writing career.<br />Support him... its worth it.f this is how he approaches his writing career.<br />Support him... its worth it.	2000-05-10

Ms. Robyn Williams not only dispels it but forever puts it to rest!<br />When I first reviewed this book, I did so after reading less than 50 pages.  Well, now I'm back after reading the other 250 pages.  I am still of the opinion that Ms. Williams is a master of romance writing.<br />This book alerts the world that in pain there is healing - if your trust  is not misplaced.  Please don't sleep this author's work.  It will be a  misfortunate act if you do. But before I get to the wisdom she so  graciously blesses us with, I have to say that all of your reviews which  hailed Ms. Williams' ability to create real life erotic love scenes were  right on target, and I agree with you wholeheartedly.  Girlfriend knows how  to fry a bed room scene.  I counted a six page love scene between Elliot  and Imagany.  The current record is held by Rochelle Alers in &quot;Happily  Ever After&quot;, 7 pages.  (As you can see, I take my romance novels  seriously).  Ms. Williams is definitely to be taken in small doses in the  romance arena, and has proven in &quot;Preconceived Notions&quot; that she  is a hazard to your health!<br />But fellow readers, Girlfriend has proven  herself to be much deeper than that.  In this novel, I found healing  coupled with the emotions of love, friendship and redemption.  Its about a  phoenix rising - a woman that had went through some serious degradation  (beginning in her childhood) and then rises like a phoenix to heal.<br />I  found healing in the friendship of Caprice McKnight towards our heroine,  Imagany Jenkins.  The kind of friendship that says to the recipient  &quot;I'm with you when you're up - but you'll feel me more when you're  down.&quot;  I found healing in the love of a &quot;strong black man&quot;  in the character of Elliot Renfroe, who loved Imagany in spite of herself.  I found healing complete in the person of Imagany herself when she faces  her adversary and proclaims &quot;I can no longer let you live rent free in  my head.&quot;  Yall have just got to recognize the therapeutic cleansing  of that statement.<br />Whenever negativity from any source rears its ugly  head, simply face it and then cremate it by denying it to reside in your  spirit!  Go ahead Ms. Williams with your bad/wise self!  Thank you so  much for a wonderful love story laced with healing wisdom.<br />Before I end,  I'd like to say that during the past months I've been blessed to read  several books, all by first time writers (Kathleen Cross, Karen Quinonnes  Miller, Franklin White and Ms. Robyn Williams) and have read that some of  them had trouble getting their work to us.  After reading all of their  books, I ask WHY?  I decided that maybe a F.U.BU. should now extend to the  literary culture.  Do it just as those young brothas did it in the clothing  industry.

The woman should be declared a national disaster to the hearts of all romance readers.<br />She is dangerous with her pen the way she makes your heart go  through so many different changes.<br />I was hooked on the book before  &quot;Phyllis Hyman&quot; finished singing in the prologue; and it just  gets betta and betta!<br />I'm just beginning the book and have already  developed a high regard for way Ms. Wiliams has developed her  characterizations, both main and subordinate.  Just to show you how great  she is, girlfriend puts a chokehold on your romance juices just by laying  out the plot leading to the bedroom.  I'll make sure to have some weights  on my feet when I do get to the romance scenes that so many other of you  reviewers have already written about, because I know I will be blown out of  &quot;romance heaven.&quot;<br />I can't wait to see how Imagany will handle  her feelings of love for Elliot vs. her seeming need for the financial  support of Anthony; the way Ms. Leslie will come up with the money to keep  her man; the developing of a relationship between Carl and Caprice; and  most importantly, how Zabree will make out!<br />Before I began reading this  book, I read the 80 reviews which were posted on Amazon.com and out of  all  that I read, only one had something negative to say.  As I continue getting  into this book, I wonder was the reviewer reading the same book!  I see  &quot;Nothing but love,&quot; baby!  And it's presented in such a way that  you can't help but let everyone know!<br />I've already received my copy of  &quot;Twist of Fate.&quot;  Based on this first novel, the only thing I  needed to know was that Robyn Williams had written it. I'd advise anyone  reading this review to do the same.<br />I'm sure I speak for all romance  readers when I say, &quot;God Bless Ms. Robyn Williams to keep on keepin  on!

The many unfortunate romances that Vaugh had previously  experienced justifies this reluctance.  But oh! how Justin breaks down  those barriers of reluctance.  And fellow romance readers, Ms. Hill doesn't  disappoint her constant fans in the intrigue either.  You think you've  figured out the ending but then you second guess yourself until you want to  just end the suspense and read the ending before finishing what's between.  Thank goodness I restrained myself ths time, but the ending is  fantastic.<br />Go out and get the book and enjoy all the emotions which Ms.  Hill evokes!	2000-04-22

That is the name of the game that this writer plays; and she is a master at her craft!<br />Romance readers, this is a must read.  Ms. Rice wraps you around her little finger and slowly reels you in until you don't know which  way is up.  The beautiful love story she pins between a young and gorgeous  25 year old woman and a superfine man who is grappling with middle age  keeps your interested until Ms. Rice feels it's time to release your heart  string (and beware, the author puts a chokehold on that muscle).<br />For a  first time romance writer she knows how to get you hooked on her writing  style.  Even though we know, both spiritually and secularly that adultery  is wrong, you will feel yourself rooting for the love that's building  between these two lovers. And then you find yourself spiraling out of  control with wanting to know just how this love tryst will end.<br />Ms.  Rice had me in so much suspense that I read the last page, when I still had  100 pages to go.  I couldn't help myself.  That is a sign of a great  writer; and Ms. Rice is such a one!  But guess what yall?

To read ova and ova and ova again!<br />Ms. Kathleen Cross has a dynamite novel on her hands.<br />Prior to reading this author's work I thought I had been catapulted to the pinnacle of romance mountaintops via the writing of  such big guns as Rochelle Alers, Bette Ford, Gay G. Gunn, Brenda Jackson,  Evelyn Palfrey, Donna Hill, Sandra Brown and Terry McMillan, just to name a  few.  And the brothas that also launched me to those mountaintops, we  can't forget them either, such as Eric Jerome Dickey, E. Lynn Harris, James  Earl Hardy, Louis Edwards and Michael Baisden.<br />Well, guess what Yall, we  have to build more mountaintops and put Ms. Cross along with the greats.  Just imagine all of the above greats rolled into one with Donna Hill  leading the pack for her mystery input and you come up with Ms. Kathleen  Cross.  I told you this woman is dynamite (say it like JJ used to say it on  &quot;Good Times&quot;).<br />It's hard to believe that this is the sistah's  first time out in the literary arena.  You have just got to give her major  props for this book.<br />Get ready to have your head blown completely off  your shoulders.  This woman's pen is loaded down with mind-blowing  dialogue.  On the cover of the book Ms. Rita Ewing astutely lets us know  what type of writer Ms. Cross is. The book is &quot;filled with the best  ingredients:  love, intrigue, conflict and hidden secrets.&quot;  Well,  anyone who is privileged to read &quot;Skin  Deep&quot; had better put on  your safety belts before getting on the roller coaster of emotions that Ms.  Cross has in store for you.<br />Take a ride through the caverns of hidden  secrets (and there are many); get slam dunked in the bed of LOVE, then ride  through the underworld of intrigue, and we finally exit into the world of  conflicts (again, there are many) - but not necessarily in that  order.<br />Now lets wrap the whole package around a stellar cast, created by  the one and only Kathleen Cross.  Meet Nina Moore - a black woman sealed in  a white body; Ahmad Jefferson - a beautiful black specimen who has been  wrongfully imprisoned for &quot;5 years, 3 months, 4 days and six  hours&quot; (and when you read how he gets slam-dunked in the bed of LOVE  you'll recognize the effect of this imprisonment).  This brotha wants  nothing more than to forget about the harm he encountered at the hands of  white people who professed to love him.  Now put this in the mix - Nina  sets her sights on this fine brotha from the gitty up (getting you  interested in reading this book)?  You can imagine the conflicts which will  arise out of this situation.<br />Now meet some subordinate cast members, but  very important ones to the story, and each in their own way creates much  drama.  Mitchel Moore - Nina's father, Tonya - Nina's best friend (is black  and looks black) Nathan - Nina's half brother and the creme De La creme  supporting cast member, Morris Michaels.<br />The plot that brings Nina  together with her man/apart from her man and..., and the reasons  surrounding this mismatched, star crossed couple will keep them on your  mind long after you've read the last punctuation mark and have you wishing  that there was more to read.<br />The ending will blow you out of romance  heaven, as never before captured on paper.<br />The poem by one of the  characters I neglected to mention (Rasheed Steele who is Tonya's lover) is  so real and pertinent to our people as it puts forth what was taken from us  by a people who never had it themselves will have you reflecting on its  importance for a very long time.  Please, Please, Please just buy the book  and experience and breathe this woman's work of art. I assure you, you will  not be disappointed.<br />Though I share all of my books with ten other  people, I'm going to buy another (or maybe even two more) to keep, just in  case this one never makes it back to me.  The book is all that!<br />By the  way, I wish the people putting the pictures on the coversof these novels  would take the time to read the book so the faces would coincide  with, or  at the very least, resemble what the author depicts in the written word.

IF  THIS HAD BEN THE CASE, I DON'T THINK VERDI WOULD HAVE BEEN SO READILY  SUSCEPTIBLE TO PARTICIPATION IN THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL JOHNSON  INITIATED.<br />PERTAINING TO ROWE, YES, HE DID SAVE VERDI'S LIFE, BUT THEN HE  TURNED AROUND AND STOLE IT BACK FROM HER WITH HIS DESTRUCTION OF HER OWN  SELF-WELL.  ALTHOUGH ANGER WAS MY DOMINANT EMOTION ASSOCIATED INITIALLY  WITH JOHNSON, I EXPERIENCED RESPECT FOR HIM BECAUSE HE DID TRY TO SAVE  VERDI, DURING HIS PERIOD OF PERSONAL DEGRADATION.<br />THE ENDING WAS  WONDERFUL AND MORE THAN MADE UP FOR THE DEPRESSION I EXPERIENCED.<br />THANK  YOU DIANE FOR A GREAT STORY.  LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR FUTURE WORKS.	1999-12-16

STANHOPE SHOULD STICK WITH THE FORMULA THAT, IN THIS READER'S OPINION, TAKES HER FROM A MEDIOCRE WRITER TO POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING GREAT ROMANCE WRITER.<br />THAT FORMULA IS HER ABILITY TO WRITE  HUMOROUS ROMANCE NOVELS, AS SHE DISPLAYED IN HER WRITING &quot;MADE FOR  EACH OTHER&quot; AND &quot;NIGHT TO REMEMBER.&quot; IF YOU WANT TO READ HER  BEST, CHECK OUT THESE TWO.<br />I WILL NOT KEEP THIS ONE TO READ OVER AND  OVER AGAIN; THOUGH I DO NOT REGRET BUYING IT.	1999-12-16

Before you start reading the book, this reader suggests that you plug in a fan.  Girlfriend, as usual, is smokin!  No one can put  a twist on romance writing like Ms. Jackson.  The budding romance between  Trask and Felicia turned into a smokin inferno and if you don't have a fan  on hand you will certainly burn! .  Notwithstanding romance, Ms. Jackson  tugs at your heartstrings with the relationship she builds with the  entrance of Felicia's son and his wish for Christmas; thus you should also  have a handkerchief ready with that fan.  If you're looking for romance,  Ms. Jackson is the diva of that subject.<br />The story by Felicia (another of  my favorite authors) was cute.  I can't give any kudos at all for Ms.  Walker.  I didn't like the writing style.	1999-12-02

SHE IS A LITERARY GENIUS.  THE CHOKEHOLD SHE PUTS ON YOUR EMOTIONS KEEPS YOU TURNING THE  PAGES LATE INTO THE MIDNIGHT HOUR.<br />HER TAKE ON THE ROMANCE SCENES LEAVE  YOU GASPING FOR BREATH.  BUT WRAPPED AROUND ALL OF THAT IS THE MOST  SUSPENSFUL STORY I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING.<br />THAT PART ABOUT THE  TAPE AND WHAT IT CONTAINED, WHICH WASN'T PRESENTED TO THE VERY END WAS  HEART STOPPING.  THE EVOLVEMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARC AND VIVIAN  WAS SUPERB AND SO DOWN TO EARTH BELIEVABLE.  MS. PALFREY EVEN GOT ME TO  ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR WALTER, BUT THE SCENE SHE PRESENTED OF HOW HE JUST  THREW PASSION AT VIVIAN PUT AN END TO THAT EMOTION QUICK AND A HURRY.  BUT  THEN I GOT CAUGHT UP IN FEELING SORRY AGAIN FOR OLE WALTER WHEN HE HAD TO  TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL.  MY EMOTIONS WERE ROCKING AND REELING AND YOURS  WILL BE IF YOU SHOULD HAVE THE PRIVLEGE OF READING THIS AUTHOR'S WORK.<br />THE INTERACTION OF VIVIAN'S MOTHER WAS THE CONSUMATE TWIST IN THIS BOOK,  WHAT WE MOTHER'S WON'T DO FOR OUR YOUNG WAS TAKEN TO THE LIMITS IN THIS  BOOK. OLE GLORIA TURNED OUT TO BE THE ULTIMATE MAMA IN THIS ONE, EVEN  THOUGH I HAD TROUBLE WITH HER PART IN WALTER'S COVER-UPS.<br />IF YOU WANT  YOUR FUNNY BONE TICKLED, WALTER WILL SURELY DO IT WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THE  WAY HE GOES ABOUT SOLVING HIS DILEMMA AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE.  I WAS  HYSTERICAL WHEN I READ OF WHAT VIVIAN WAS THINKIKNG AND WANTED TO SHOUT BUT  COULND'T LET THE WORDS OUT.<br />MARC IS THE MAN OF THE HOUR AND KNOWS HOW TO  PLEASE HIS WOMAN IN EVERY WAY, EVEN WHEN SHE IS BREAKING HIS HEART.  AND  SHERMAN O SHERMAN, THAT IS THE MOST CREM DE LA CREM OF SUSPENSE TWISTS.  MS. PALFREY IS A SMOOTH OPERATOR WHEN IT COMES TO TWISTS AND  TURNS.<br />ENOUGH!  BUY THE BOOK AND EXPERIENCE PARADISE!<br />I TOO AM  AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF HER OTHER TWO BOOKS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY  ANYTHING SHE PUTS OUT.	1999-11-11

SHE HAS FREQUENTLY, LED ME THROUGH AN EMOTIONAL GAMUT WITH HER ABILITY TO TELL A STORY AND KEEP YOU INTERESTED FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST PUNCTUATION  MARK.  NOT SO IN THIS SEQUEL.  WHEN I WENT ON LINE AND SAW THAT SHE HAD  WRITTEN ANOTHER BOOK, I WAS GLEEFUL, TO SAY THE LEAST.  UPON RECEIVING THE  BOOK, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT SHE FELT SHE HAD MORE TO SAY ON THE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARK AND NICOLE.  I FELT THAT SHE HAD DONE A SUPERB  JOB IN TELLING THE STORY THE FIRST TIME.  NICOLE AND MARK HAD GOTTEN  TOGETHER VIA MARRIAGE, HAD A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER AND HAD SEEN MARK'S DREAM  COME TRUE VIA BUILDING OF THE RESORT.  WHAT MORE COULD YOU ADD?  NOTHING!<br />AND THAT'S JUST WHAT MISS FAYE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED.<br />I READ  THE BOOK THE FIRST TIME, AND DON'T ENJOY HAVING TO RE-READ IT AGAIN,  ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TELLING OF IT IS SO DRAB.  THE FIRE AND EMOTION  DISPLAYED IN HER EARLIER BOOKS JUST DON'T SEEM TO COME THROUGH IN THIS  ONE.<br />I STILL LOVE YOU THOUGH GIRL!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT  PICTURE?<br />THAT'S NOT REALITY TO ME.

I SUGGEST SHE LEAVE THE MYSTERY WRITING TO THOSE  THAT DO IT BEST AND GIVE US THE ROMANCE THAT SHE HAS SET HEARTS AND SOULS  ON FIRE WITH.

BUT YOU'VE PROVED THAT WRONG IN THE DYNAMITE LOVE STORY BETWEEN MATT AND SHANNON IN &quot;ONLY HERS.&quot;  NOT ONLY ARE YOUR LOVE SCENES  TO DIE FOR, BUT THE BEAUTIFUL WAY YOUR PLOTS EVOLVE SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A  STANDARD FORMAT FOR ALL WOULD BE ROMANCE WRITERS.  I CAN'T WAIT TO START  DANIEL'S STORY (&quot;HEART OF THE FALCON&quot;) AND THEN DOMINIQUE'S.  ALL  OF WHICH I HAVE. I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU MORE THAN A FIVE STAR RATING!!  KEEP ON KEEPING ON!	1999-04-16

RAY WILL BLOW YOUR LIBIDO STRAIGHT OFF THE CHARTS!!  THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I READ BY HER, AND AM I GLAD I DID.  HER STYLE OF WRITING IS UNIQUE.  EVERY WORD, EVERY  SENTENCE, EVERY PARAGRAPH CAPTURES YOUR ATTENTION, AND BY THE TIME THE REAL  DEAL ERUPTS (MEANING DYNAMITE LOVE SCENES) YOU'RE SO BREATHLESS, YOU HAVE  TO TAKE A REST BEFORE CONTINUING ON.  FOR THE SISTERS THAT DON'T HAVE A MAN  FOR NOW, JUST PUT YOURSELF IN THE ARMS OF MS. RAY'S CHARACTERS AND  REJOICE!!  I DID, AND I'M STILL SMILING!!.  AND TO KEEP ON SMILING, I'VE  JUST ORDERED EVERY BOOK I COULD FIND WITH HER NAME ON IT.  I FOUND 4.  ARE  THERE ANY MORE?	1999-04-16

FOSTER SHOULD READ SOME REAL ROMANCE BOOKS BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTS ANOTHER NOVEL, IF THIS IS THE BEST THERE IS FORTHCOMING FROM HER PEN!!  IT'S AS IF SHE'S AFRAID TO TOUCH ON WRITING ABOUT LOVE-MAKING, LET ALONE WRITE A SCENE  ABOUT IT!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.  GO DO THE LAUNDRY INSTEAD!!  I SUGGEST  SHE TAKE SOME PAGES OF OUR MS.RAY, MS. JACKSON AND MS FORD'S BOOKS BEFORE  PUTTING PEN TO PAPER AGAIN.  TOO BAD YOU DON'T ALLOW LESS THAN ONE STAR  RATINGS.  THIS ONE WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE TOP WITH THAT!!	1999-04-14

THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST.  MR JOHNSON, I LAUGHED HILARIOUSLY FROM PAGE 384 - 399.  YOUR REFERENCE TO A POPULAR (?) NAMESAKE IS FANTASTIC, AND AS FAR AS I AM  CONCERNED IS TOTALLY ACCURATE CHARACTERISTICALLY OF MR. C.T.<br />LOOKING  FORWARD TO A SEQUEL.  YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WRITE ONE BECAUSE WE ALL WANT TO  KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO SON #1.  THANKS FOR GIVING ME SUCH A GREAT READ.	1999-03-08

The plot was null and void.  Can't see why the author even bothered.  Wish there was a lower rating other than a one star.	1999-02-08
