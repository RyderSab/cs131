Most all the reviews seem positive-even fluff or puff? So would honest critique or Onions to balance the Orchids also help? <br /> <br />Why not, I thought. I'm (1) a fan of the book. I'm (2) working on a word-and-image book myself. I'm also (3) a good book reviewer-well, supposedly...  (Full Disclosure: I was sent a  copy of G,G as a publicity-sample because of-it was stated-my reviews on this site!)  <br /> <br />So I asked, what are the demerits in G,G if any? Errors in content (misconceptions, omissions)? Errors in style? But (good news) I largely failed. Found no major flaws. Only, perhaps, incompletenesses. (So she didn't yet write the perfect \\"how-to\\" book, instead of the enthusiastic \\"aha\\" book. But is it fair to say she should have?) <br /> <br />\\"Look, it's Venus de Media, windsurfing in on a halfshell on a wing, a prayer, and a colorlaserprinter. With coloratura swirls of genteelly-hysterical enthusiasm.....\\" <br /> <br />Well, no, wait just a mo-ment here!... A better analogy:  \\"Look, from the mountaintop, Valerie shows us the whole new world on the other side, an emerging landscape of new word-and-image integration. (Colored forests and lakes, pictures grown in the fields of Print...) BUT where are the Footpaths down? Where the Pitfalls to avoid, the Potentialities to seek? Where is the map of specific trails, alternate routes to actually enter this New World?\\" <br /> <br />[I must be fair. A competent book reviewer MUST focus on (1) what the book ITSELF tried to do, and did it achieve it? (In Val's case, the What and Why of \\"designer writing\\" with color and images.) And NOT on (2) what did the book's REVIEWER want the book to do! (In my case, more on the details of How, short of a recipe.) Also PERHAPS on (3) what the book \\"SHOULD or COULD\\" have done, or done better, or tried to do-but objectively. <br /> <br />Okay, (1), problems in style, first. Others noted that the Introduction seems overlong, alsotoo chronological-personal, and that the Body also repeats-and-repeats the main point(s). (Stories are good if personalizing, bad if lacking ideas. Repetition is good for dynamic emphasis, bad if just redundant.) [[Could professional editing have helped this common problem?]] <br /> <br />Then (2), problems in content, including omissions... Again I must be fair. Val wrote in her own personal style. Artists cannot do otherwise. In an interview she made it very clear. \\"I'm putting forth this book as a showcase of what is now possible. But everyone has his or her own individual design aesthetic. I like full-page bleeds, expressive typography, energetic colors, and emotional depth. I freely acknowledge that there are thousand other possible design aesthetics.\\" Why ask her to create otherwise? <br /> <br />Still, I eagerly wanted to know, what other options do exist for other artists? 1. Color is the book's big variable. But verbalvisual Designer Writing can also use 2. Images of varied types (even pattern design, cartographic, etc.), also 3. Typography (font type and size), and all within 4. Page Design or layout and formatting beyond the CPPC or Continuous Prose in Paragraphed Columns so typical of Gutenberg Gray... [[Did we need more on these last three methods?]] <br /> <br />Plus not just how, but WHY or rationale in the first place. Val emphasizes (1) the Pragmatic (to reach reluctant readers), plus (2) the Pleasurable (to give all readers media delight.)  But another may be (3) the Efficient (to help readers understand verbal content faster, via visual images). And another pleasurable, (4) the Aesthetic (to delight via verbal and visual co-equal and integrated). [[Should these latter two have been discussed more?]] <br /> <br />For instance. The early story of Val's train ride in to work and her reflections.  And later, her recent story of her seeking publishers and the like after resigning teaching. Not that she SHOULD have done this, but I thought how both these messages COULD have been done in innovative Typography plus Page-Layout. Rescued from the lock-step of just CPPC or continuous prose in paragraphed columns and typical type? For instance, left-hand, formal narrative, in vanilla type ... then right-hand, her informal reflections-and in plaid-flavor type? Or \\"whatever,\\" this is just for-instance. [[What other tools lie ahead? ]] <br /> <br />Plus, analysis of the barriers to Designer Writing-the better to surmount them? <br />The book notes (A) sheer unawareness. Also (B) institutional inertia. But what about (C) Creator-limitations? (To do visual, requires right-brain skills. But do many writers work more in left-brain modes?) Also, I imagine (D) Technical limitations. (Bad News: for me to learn Photoshop, Pagemaker, InDesign, etc., demands big resources! But Good News: less investment might work for some. I am now creating a word-&-image book of poetry with visuals. No color, alas. But type-fests and layout-picnics. And all with only Microsoft Word and a basic scanner. So...)   [[ Still, should these last two barriers have been discussed a bit more? ]] <br /> <br />And thus my sweet-sour critique of G,G. So you see it largely failed. If this is all I can say against this good book, why not stop.\\"  (And I will, affirming my appreciation for G.G.) <br /> <br />Still, the word-image Revolution needs this \\"wake-up call\\" (nailed to the door of publishing houses?)  But we also need the \\"ways on in,\\" not rules, but possibilities clarified. <br /> <br />But, one step at a time. Perhaps \\"Val's second or next book\\" will lay out the routes in, not just the views of. (Perhaps she might  edit an anthology, or collaborate with others-or leave it to others.) Take it as a compliment. Why should I hanker for the How-To, if Val's book hadn't affirmed so well the Why-Do it in the first place? <br /> <br />	2005-01-25

Well, \\"Duh,\\" so did Shakespeare. Literature is not the What, it's the How. And these stories are dynamic artistry with a toned voice. Not \\"telling\\" or prosaic, pondering, ponderous, plodding, author-intrusive. Instead, \\"showing\\" or a suave crafted re-creation of a world which lets us readers actively participate in real-izing... <br /> <br />Sure, it's been told about how some gay men were stereotypical sissy-boys, in love with high heels and musicals at age ten. But what of the father in the family? Never better sketched than in \\"The Music Of Your Life.\\" Ray is well-meaning but spooked by \\"this problem son\\" who \\"does and says things in a way that you despise...hints at behavior you want to part of...\\" But you \\"regret bitterly that you feel this way, because you see that other people...appreciate things about him that you can't/won't/don't.\\" This gender-role-identity pain is conveyed poignantly via its suave control. <br /> <br />Okay, it's been told how at least earlier, a young man is gay, realizes it, experiences sex but also true love with another male-but then gets kidnapped. Lets himself get shanghaied, stolen, spirited away by the internalized homophobia which makes him nervously flee that tender advisable good. To resist deny evade it, by straight-marriage. (Death of love and hence one's life, and by psychic suicide too.) But Rowell's \\"Spectators in Love\\" tells it superbly (by the man's former lover, years later.) With the extra added ending enrichment of the lover's coming to a cosmic cameo of resolved acceptance of-much..... (Wherein, \\"minority\\" literature can attain major, general-human significance.) <br /> <br />Okay, it's been told about family relations. Or rather quasi-relations, semi-relations between gay or lesbian child (covertly Outside) and traditional parents (uneasily Inside). But never better than in \\"The Mother-of-the-Groom and I.\\" Here a gay man helps his mother shop for a dress for the wedding of his only sibling, his heterosexual brother. And the artful coda; a resolution satisfying but realistic too... <br /> <br />Okay, it's been told the precarious quality of the inter- and intra-personal life of the homosexual male living (1) as a male with male sexuality, and (2) relating with other similar males.  Can we say jealousy and competition unleashed from heterosexual conventions, sexism as in favoring the sexy, and this involves also ageism rampant, plus the issue of loneliness and isolation on personal and social levels, and the like? Probably we could say. Again it's been told, but scarcely more poignantly than in \\"Delegates\\" as well as \\"Who Loves You?\\" Both attaining to artistry, the \\"aesthetic distance\\" draining out the mere acid of pain, distilling into the elixir of insight. <br /> <br />Two other stories complete this six-pak with lagniappe. For good gay-minority short stories, read this book. For short stories superior in artistry and insight, read this book. <br />	2005-01-20

These twenty stories seemed to me excellent, also okay, few deficient. I found a quarter of them to be good art. <br /> <br />(1)  Five stories seem artistically meritorious. Plus the gay-specific content seems to universalize to general human themes.  <br /> <br />\\"TV Dinner\\" is a romp. Set in a high-end status-snob restaurant, it serves up the real \\"menu\\" of human discomfort-food.  Several \\"courses.\\" The waiter's rage at being a \\"candy-ass bootlick,\\" and his terrors too. The chef's self-deluded egotism. The society matron's gorging unhealthily on Status Cake. The smarmy politico mayor exposed as being a gross feeder. The cast of workers in the out-caste system, pretty petty frustrated in the all-too-subhuman jealousies and other deadly-sin ingredients. But the author is a master-wordchef who concocts up these raw materials gourmet-style with his buttercup-swirl of tall-food diction, aesthetically-nourishing word-candy, a just-desserts confection whose sauce-iness is perfectly balanced with sweet-sour imagery plus insight. This many-course tasting menu moves right along madcap but on point! <br /> <br />Not so shabby either is \\"Teamwork,\\" about a proofreader at an advertising agency. Poignant specifically about the \\"beautiful young man named Todd D'Onofrio,\\" fetching but unobtainable, the protagonist's Harlow or shepherd boy...  But pointed generally about the universal human tangle of miscommunications, pettiness about font-styles, power and status issues, insecurities, insensitivities. The miscast of characters in the office seem to carry these warts and blemishes like a virus re-infecting those whose Psychological Immune Systems  are not mature enough. Solid and sprightly, madcap and satirical. <br /> <br />Adult men with younger or teenage males is the subject of both \\"Some Speculations on the Bob Uncertainty\\" and also \\"Chicken.\\" But the former, pondering why a young hunk continues to revisit an older man, seems to do so with much enjoyable grace, verve, bemused and appreciative non-needy distance aesthetic not emotional. <br /> <br />\\"American Widow\\" portrays a woman inundated by giant waves of major depression. It energetically risks sentimentality in the depicting of her almost-melodramatic multiple missteps, but it does powerfully paint her pathos. <br /> <br />(2) A second set of stories seems (to me) more simply to simply narrate events, almost diary style.  In \\"Aqua Calda,\\" an American on a film shoot in Italy, scores with an Italian. Okay... In \\"Taking Pictures,\\" a highschooler sees that a teacher of his takes videotapes of the guys working out. Okay... <br /> <br />(3) Minority perspective is represented by \\"Wave,\\" His Five-Year Sentence,\\" and \\"Rondo.\\" New here is local color and representativeness I guess. <br /> <br />(4) Psychological insight however Politically Non-Correct I saw in three stories. \\"ONJ.com\\" shows gay man and straight woman but can candidly ask whether this man at least is as he describes gay men generally, as being \\"damaged, dangerous people. They feel wronged and are looking for vengeance.\\" Refreshing anyhow to investigate. In \\"Advanced Soaring,\\" why why why does moonstruck Mark keep on seeking after louche lax Luke at all? And in \\"The Inadvertant Headshot,\\" the protagonist fears becoming a soiled type: \\"the humorless, thin-skinned gay man, the art fag, the prissy prude who trafficked in disdain\\" contemptuously to \\"rue, resent and scorn again\\" because feeling out of control. Something gay here; something human also. We are well past the Dark Age when a hoity (and hetero) reviewer would allude to the above dirty laundry as indicating something like \\"the pathology of homosexuality,\\" blah blah. (Of course, it is still verboten now, to even reference in the same sentence, \\"homosexual males,\\" and the issue of \\"attachment disorder\\" or problems-with-intimacy...) <br /> <br />Finally in its own category, \\"Ground Control\\" sends us home with a take-out treat. The 16-year-old gay highschooler has his problems, with self-image, self-acceptance. But his, and our, hero is his 14-year-old brother Frankie. This kid comes out to his dysfunctional family simply by drawing Star War cartoons of himself and Luke Skywalker. At the kitchen table. Just going about his business. Utterly unbugged by his sister's or anyone's reaction to his being his own true if socially-despised self so early. A universal model for us all, gay, straight, bi, or plaid... <br /> <br />Then six more stories I haven't mentioned. But all told, the anthology is quite valid for those interested in some quality and much variety in current gay male short fiction. <br />	2004-12-18

Poems today (maybe always) risk remaining \\"prosaic-poems.\\" Low-voltage diluted prose conversation. Could have stayed in a paragraph, but was divided into poetic lines but arbitrarily, with no skill in \\"enjambment.\\" (The how and why you divide the lines for dynamic pace tone emphasis structure etc.) <br /> <br />But walk along the \\"seashore beach\\" of this anthology. Move aside the frequent \\"prosaic-poems,\\" and you'll find \\"true poems.\\" Distilled language balancing fire and ice, packing Dionysian emotions and energy within the Apollonian frame of form, style, craft. \\"Attainment and restraint,\\" the artistic skill which freeze-dries significance to save it for the reader later elsewhere to savor. Seashells to listen into for an earful indeed! <br /> <br />Oh, not that the more-prosaic verse here is \\"bad.\\" Shares much sincerely. Fractious families. Tangled relationships with straight boys. Coming out into frank pride. Militant protest about martyrs. \\"Aubades\\" or \\"morning-after\\" poems but with gritty twists to them, \\"the way we live now.\\" And more. <br /> <br />But note the gems for which you can beachcomb here. (1) Hear the distinct voices. M. A. Tata is a hearty hoot, froth and fluff which is yet solid, perhaps an offspring of Frank O'Hara out of Truman Capote? (2) Enjoy the fixed poetic forms. Eric Norris dates traditional poetic forms, goes to the dance hall with the villanelle, ballad, sonnet-and they twinstar together, making and conveying meaning, not just prosaically mouthing it! (3) Appreciate a to-be classic. Wendell Ricketts' \\"Jubilat Agnes\\" catalog poem (about his failed dating) will become a standard \\"j'accuse\\" which skewers a whole dismal list of Gay Male Disconnectedness, preserves those butterflies on pins.  (Or perhaps just Generic Male Driftiness?) (4) Enjoy at least one audacious rewriting of a straight-culture myth. In \\"Icarus on the Moon,\\" the winged boy Goes Gay, soars beyond terrestrial paternity to escape to a lunar colony of boys and men... <br /> <br />(4) Appreciate skilled confronting of the Plague. AIDS has infected the body poetic also these days. But in art, the \\"antibodies\\" of style can help keep this enemy corralled somewhat. (Which is what art does...) On the page at least if not in life, these poets arm-wrestle the disease into clarity. Audacious leaps here too. Fog over Manhattan contains the ghosts of the lost. The end of World War Two makes one think of another war: \\"The only war I know is internal, is fought / in the blood and the marrow of men / and women and children who, despite their passion, / can not fire back.\\" Even the Birth at Bethlehem is invoked and related. The poem \\"Don't Look In A Mirror For Two Weeks\\" is acrobatic, juggling several distinct tones at once: rue and regret, self-satire, and more. <br /> <br />Enough. Stroll this beach and enjoy the lesser poems for their effective-enough reports of experience. Savor the greater poems for their very-effective recreations of experience. <br /> <br />	2004-10-12

History, racing. I liked the technical tidbits on how the bicycle became perfected. Why those tippy early models with the huge front wheel you perched atop? Because no chain drive yet, no ball bearings (the atoms of the machine age, replacing fraying bushings), and before the pneumatic tire the larger the wheel the softer the ride. Oh, and angled spokes helped too. The pedal replaced the back-and-forth treadle, which increased speed many-fold. Who knew? And suspension springs aren't just for comfort, they enormously aid off-roading. Now I know. The other reviews here tell more. Praise the bicycle, which in my opinion ranks with microwave ovens, duct tape, and word-processors as the noblest inventions...	2004-09-19
US	51224960	R2DZQF0AW33X7M	0299196801	51200656	A Passion to Preserve: Gay Men as Keepers of Culture	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Behind the Drywalls, Secrets about Gender Role Identity	Will Fellows is himself a sort of preservationist writer. His first book, Farm boys, recovered the childhoods of rural gay men in scholarly-memoir format. This time, he painstakingly identified gay men nationwide who seek to \\"keep culture\\" by restoring historically-valuable old buildings. The body of the book consists of the recorded testimonies of 29 individuals (or couples) by region, plus cameos of still others. <br /> <br />But this body is not the book's \\"soul\\" perhaps. Which is to help clarify \\"what it means to be gay.\\" \\"Even more than culture keeping, that's what this book is about,\\" Fellows confirms. Specifically, he scrutinizes the suspect stereotype of gay men as gender-role atypical or noncomformist, let alone effeminate. He finds it may be an accurate image or a \\"sociotype\\" after all. That is, an image based in reality. Florists, hair stylists, interior designers? Yes, but also house restorers and antiquarians. And joining women in \\"fields that revolve around creating, restoring, and preserving beauty, order, and continuity.\\" Gay men flourish in those concerns, sometimes outnumbering women. The image is true, it seems. <br /> <br />Fellows usefully clarifies key terms. \\"Homosexual\\" refers to sexual orientation: behavior, self-identification, fantasy and arousal. (And, I would add, emotional spiritual adhesion...) But then \\"gay\\" encompasses not only that but gender identity. Which can include gender-atypicality-being \\"psychologically and perhaps physically androgynous.\\" And also \\"effeminacy,\\" although this surpasses \\"a swishy, limp-wristed prissiness. It encompasses \\"qualities or characteristics generally possessed by girls and women\\" and may involve not only speaking gesturing walking, but also interests aptitudes values emotions. Such as the passion to conserve, preserve. As Fellows puts it, \\"Males have great inclination and capacity for creating and building new, but females and gay males possess the greater inclination to re-create, rebuild, restore,preserve.\\" Due to \\"a decidedly feminine ethos\\" that values \\"continuity of identity, maintaining connections, remembering.\\" <br /> <br />So this thrust usefully helps balance clarify this contested issue of gender-role-identity. Stereotypes, Political Correctness, social consructivism, essentialism. Now we can point to this culture-keeping quality of gay males as due to more than-more disposable income plus oppression! <br /> <br />So the book serves at least two audiences. Specifically, preservationists and their camp followers. Generally, those interested in gay male identity, gender-role-identity. <br /> <br />I could quibble only with the statistics? Does a \\"sampling error\\" raise its head here? Gay men into preservation, the sample, does not examine all gay males. So it might be insufficient, unrepresentative for the generalization about gay men? But it does echo prior research finding that childhood gender-atypicality and homosexuality are correlated. And indeed we recall those \\"special\\" farm boys, mavericks or outliers before puberty, amateur family genealogists, raisers of fancy poultry, and the rest... <br /> <br />I could also wish for more meat with the potatoes? I could wish the interviews had been less storytelling and more conceptual. In Telling Our Stories concretely, we sometimes miss the interesting conceptualities behind it all. I felt yoked to the plowing team (so to speak) of autobiography on the lower field. I wished to ascend to the hilly heights of ideas about preservation, keystone issues in it. Perhaps a separate essay to learn about problems, pitfalls, potentialities, levels of competence, etc. <br /> <br />But the reviewer shouldn't condemn a book for not doing what the reviewer personally preferred. All told, Fellows' contribution to the social psychology of sexual-role identity is really valuable. In the glut of print today, what justifies \\"yet another book\\"? Well, something truly new on an important issue, or at least not just repeating the known but advancing and clarifying it. As I found here. <br />	2004-09-17

I have a biased insight on why Norse is not better known. His style is one of \\"common everyday speech\\" as championed by Norse's \\"teacher and father\\" William Carlos Williams. It's a valid style, the vernacular opera style of poetry (including Walt Whitman and the Beat Generation too). <br /> <br />But is it ultimately less poetry than prose? Prosaic statement, plodding the pavement, rather than soaring aloft airborne into truer poetry with its images, complexities, dynamisms, controlled-and-creative? Perhaps truer poetry is more-well, poetic than Norse's usual statements: editorials scene-sketches  reportages reminiscences etc. <br /> <br />For me (remember, bias!), too often Norse either just states, or launches into sentimental pseudo-emotion, as here: <br /> <br />\\"oh the felony of unbuttoned flies / assault and battery of good looks / immorality of being alive / organism of death crime of coming /\\"    [p. 420] <br /> <br />Or (more rarely) it's posingly derivative as from Whitman through Ginsberg: <br /> <br />\\"Old black Remington noiseless, what shall we type today? / is there room among your keys? for real feelings? cool moods? / \\"(One could almost ask this second question of too many of Norse's poems...) <br /> <br />At infrequent times Norse does ascend into subtler, more original intensification: <br /> <br />\\"Are we living / in the same city? / Are we empty-handed, empty-minded / sacks of wind and dust? Believe me,/ he writes, I'm your friend, in spite / \\"  [P. 419] <br /> <br />And at times the Whitmanesque Beatnik rant does become more subtle-supple than just yawping, becomes more autonomous than automatic: <br /> <br />Will someone stop me in the street saying / how wonderful! We don't know each other?! / just walk arm in arm / & never ask our names! / make love at sight! anonymous as monks! / Esperanto lips! / africa in my arms! Near East!   [P. 324] <br /> <br />But alas yet more rare are more-controlled, more-creative passages which let the idea speakfor itself with the power of understatement: <br /> <br />\\"I love your eyebrows, said one. / the distribution of your body hair / is sensational, what teeth, said two. / your mouth is cocaine, said three. / your lips, said four, look like sexual organs. / they are, I said. / as I got older features thickened. / the body grew flabby, then / thin in the wrong places, they / all shut up or spoke about life./\\"   [P. 466] <br /> <br />I hope the above series of quotations show my biased insight about mechanical derivative and prosaic \\"poetry\\" versus more-poetical intensity which rides aloft on its own integral autonomy... <br /> <br />That said, the 615 pages of this poet's life work were well worth the chance to peruse, to skim, to review, to experience. Even if it was (for me) a journey through relatively few Power Peaks and relatively many Great Plains... <br />	2004-08-24

This let me enjoy its uniqueness. Surely not a novel. But no, not even \\"creative non-fiction.\\" Instead, a study in Baker's own unique vision.. I'll label it \\"The Aesthetics of the Everyday Technological.\\" The, ah, novel is prose-poetry. A hymn to the crafted artfulness of mundane objects, processes, experiences...<br />The plot is minimal. He ascends an escalator one day at work. Big deal. But the plot is only the line on which he strings his beads of close observations of the \\"usual.\\" It's androgynous; he marries assertive technical description of objects and processes, with sensuous flowing aesthetic experience of them.<br />So herein he gives us enlarged glimpses of soda straws; ice cube trays; perforations; paper vs. hot-air hand-drying in lavatories; paper vs. plastic coin rolls; and more. Oh, and a footnote about footnotes.<br />Plus he can give us a salvo of juicy examples to illustrate experiences.  (1) Disruptions of the expected: as in missing a top step, pulling out a Band-Aid thread, drawing a piece of tape, trying to staple a thick memo. (2) \\"How beautiful graded surfaces are as a class:\\" as in not only the escalator grooves, but also \\"the grooves on the underside of the blue whale that must render some hydrodynamic or thermal advantage; the grooves left by a rake in loose soil or by a harrow in a field; the single groove that a skater's blade makes in the ice; the grooves in socks that allow them to stretch, and in corduroy, down which you can run your ballpoint pen; the grooves of records.\\" (3) The \\"renewing of newness\\"-as in \\"whether it was the appearance of another identical Pez tablet at the neck of the plastic Pez elevator... or the sight of one parachutist after another standing for a second in the door of an airplane before he jumped... or the rolling-into-position of a pinball after the previous one had escaped your flippers... or one sticky disc of sliced bananadisplaced from its spot on the knife over the cereal bowl by its successor... or the uprising of yet another step of the escalator... \\"<br />So Baker revels in the aesthetics of the technical. But is all this decoration, art? Worse, is it even mature pleasure? Baker says that this renewing of newness \\"was for me then, and is still, one of the greatest sources of happiness that the man-made world can offer.\\"<br />But isn't this delight in the diurnal, sort of minor, even decadent? Isn't it even what's called \\"camp\\"? (In the sense of giving more attention to the less important than is warranted?) During a deep study of coffee mugs, including corny old-fashioned ones, Baker denies this. He says he theoretically disapproves of camp, but then camp \\"has long been superseded and in the limbo of its demotions can be glibly disparaged.\\"<br />But hold it. Later on, he notes that when you quit a job, things reverse. Big crises recede (\\"the problems you were paid to solve collapse\\"), and instead, you remember the small surfaces. The nod of the security guard, the escalator ride, the things on your desk, the features of the corporate bathroom, \\"all miraculously expand: and in this way what was central and what was incidental end up exactly reversed.\\" Sounds campy to me in its topsy-turvy re-valuation.<br />But perhaps the incidental becomes not just reversed, but also revered. This is surely the book's final charm for me. Perhaps it is perhaps Baker's unique achievement, subversive but satisfying. Tables are turned; away from ponderous plot or principles. Let's enjoy the techne and the aesthetics of surfaces. I can disclose that I read this book at a recent time of stress and weariness. It was then just the thing for me. I found it good fare, \\"comfort food with a gourmet sauce.\\" So, Baker's inspecting vision honors objects and processes, honors existence.	2004-07-01

Well, a 65-year-old distinguished social scientist at Harvard loses his male lover of 40 years, and also retires. And for the next five years, to cope, he pursues young men, specifically \\"escorts,\\" a.k.a. hustlers or male prostitutes or callboys. Pursues them with money, and with love, but also for their love or companionship.  The book is his candid memoir of that turbulent interlude \\"with\\" the three \\"boys\\" Grant, Skip, and Patrick..<br />You can imagine the dismal results. Especially because underlying his five-year pursuit seems to be his life-long volatile personality structure. (Should the social psychologist, have undergone psychoanalysis earlier? A graduate of same, I think so-I fear so.) Anyhow the resulting book is both case-study, and possibly \\"literature,\\" as in dynamic truthtelling, even perhaps the genre of tragedy.<br />Brown seems driven by an unresolved neediness garnished with a Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome. Saccharine lovingness toward the boys, and then the sour sauce of hatred from their inevitable joltings and jiltings of the professor. Who at the end sees himself as \\"an old fool irrelevant to their young lives.\\"<br />Specifically, Brown's style of relating to these young panthers is not heroic at all but tragicomic. A combination of attempted bear hug... ritual mating fire-dance... co-dependent orbiting... pugilistic hatred when rebuffed... and operatic laments by the \\"maiden\\" ever spurned...<br />Better he wrote it than not. At the end he stops with boys because his five-year foray was inconclusive. He had hoped that ambiguities would be resolved, meaning clarified. \\"That never happened.\\" He stopped learning anything new. He found no satisfying closure toward enlightenment. \\"The obscurity all remained and new ones were added but I saw that that was the way it would always be.\\"<br />Perhaps we the readers can learn more. That the unanalyzed, or unexamined, life is unworthy to live. That to \\"know thyself\\" truly-one's motivations, goals, identity-isas vital as the Greeks said it was twenty centuries ago. Brown says this on the next to the last page: \\"It is a lonely universe, one of many it seems, and in passing through it one needs close company, a Primary Other.\\" Well, first, if one possesses one's own true Self, one is less lonely. And second, neither his problematic, troubled 40-year \\"marriage\\" nor his hopeless liaisons with the boys, show him as consonant with his true Self. And so I can feel that there in Brown's fantastic footsteps, but for the grace of Psyche, go we. Myself, anyhow...	2004-06-25

Full Disclosure: I bring both insight and bias. You decide.<BR> <BR>As a literature teacher, I love verbal complexity for pleasure. But as a teacher of writing and \\"shirtsleeves\\" real-world writer myself (feature articles on boating, nature, travel, social issues)--I value clarity and communicability for practicality. Not to be oversimple--just to make important but demanding material accessible to a willing reader.<br />And so here \\"I just don't know...\\"  We've heard the criticism that much public academic writing is needlessly obscure, hence inaccessible, due to its jargon, abstraction, complex syntax, and the like. This book seeks to defend difficult academic writing. The authors claim that (1) readers may stubbornly claim not to understand. They also argue that (2) new and different perspectives need new presentations which shake us loose from the old conventional, traditional. They also (3) warn against the dangers of facile oversimplification.(And probably other arguments, some too obscurely-expressed to grasp quickly...)<br />Well, I'd critique the critiquers. As a freelance journalist, I must make sure the reader understands--indeed, cannot possibly misunderstand!--nd is served. George Orwell said \\"good prose is like a window pane.\\" Somerset Maugham, and E. M. Forster, said that the best writers can express ideas of subtlety and complexity quite clearly. Not that each sentence is simplistic. The style may and even should include difficulties.  But it does not mislead.<br />I also take a diachronic or historical approach. The postmodern style defended in this book often contains aerial abstractions with cloudy towers with filigree diction decorating them. Will this soon seem the momentary excess of a moment in history? (Created partially in order to create something new and hence gain power, status?) And soon to be rebalanced toward the \\"attainment and restraint\\" of good style?<br />(Less formally, I think that too much postmodern prose is hermetic reconditeinsular \\"hair oil\\"...The emperor has no clothes-or rather, is overdressed needlessly and inappropriately after all...)<br />I'd like to be convinced by the authors' defenses of linguistic density. But alas, and perhaps also significantly, I see no specific proofs. The book's writers offer no evidence that this difficulty is necessary. We shirtsleeves wordsmiths chant our mantra of \\"statistics, quotes, and anecdotes.\\" We say but then show; we give instances of specific examples to clarify abstract claims or ideas.<br />And so, how I longed to see in this book just one instance of showing how the convoluted style is indeed competent and indeed compulsory.  For example (!): take some issue (\\"vegetarianism as egalitarianism,\\" I don't care...) Then (1) state it in clear plain windowpane-prose. Then (2) recast it in the postmodern academese which this book largely defends-I think. Then (3) unpack the latter version to show how it does confront complexities more competently than the prosaic first one. But where's the down-to-earth proof or even the demonstration in this lofty book?<br />Okay, I'll walk my own talk here even if the book didn't. I'll end with an example myself. It's from Judith Butler in her \\"Values of Difficulty\\" in the volume. She's discussing human rights discourse and universality, she reports how AIDS activists in the 1980's sought to enter Spanish-speaking communities to do AIDS outreach. When they asked who was \\"homosexual,\\" few would respond. But when they later returned and asked who practiced anal sex with other men, many more people came forth. Then she sums up her \\"point\\" about all this.<br />I'll give my version (translation?) of her point here first. I'd have said, \\"When communicating with diverse audiences toward persuasion, make sure your cognitive and also emotional language is not simply how you see things, but is in line with how the audience sees things and feels free to respond.\\"<br />But here is Butler's actual version:  \\"To engage in activism is not to start with the concept of a shared language but to be prepared to find that communication can sometimes take place only when the terms that initiate a discussion undergo an expropriation that bears no resemblance to the original, where the term abandons the animating conditions of its own efficacy in order to live elsewhere as another term or as a term subjected to a radically unanticipated use.\\"<br />Well...I find her version to be overelaborated ornateness, profitless bloating which almost apotheosizes transmogrified obfuscation. (Or, which almost puts decadent obscurity on a pedestal.)  Now, I love dense diction when I write for fun in my own idiolect (a combination of Joycean wordpunplays, pidgin English, earnest illiterate, and pan-European). But when I try to do real-work (sic) writing, I seek glassine clarity the better to illuminate complexity. Sure a camera lens has a tougher job photographing clearly \\"a swamp at sundown\\" than \\"a beach at noon.\\" But a good lens (or language style) can succeed some indeed. A muddy dirty lens (or one distorted with its own interfiliated lenticular elements) can not.<br />Is much postmodern prose the painful attempt not to clarify complexities, but to Gain Points (status, reputation, power) by advancing to something new? Only problem-it's not new, just \\"monstrous and extraordinary,\\" as W. Y. Tindall used to define literary decadence...	2004-06-25
US	51224960	R3JMGLUX9DJQLP	1592400876	436381860	Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation	Books	5	16	34	N	N	Perfecting Pungent Punctilious Punctuation	Well I can see why this is a deserved best-seller. She did her work, shows \\"how.\\"<br />1. First, be complete, comprehensive-and credible. Thus, she did sedulously research all the classic books on punctuation (and scrupulously cited same in the bibliography).<br />2. Then, be comprehensive: and she did cover all the bases or issues. Apostrophe, comma, colon, semicolon, ellipses, dash, exclamation point, italic, hyphen, brackets, quotation marks-even the solidus or virgule (slash) and the interrobang?! She treats complexities exhaustively. (Like, eight uses for the apostrophe! Plus exceptions and fine points, as in \\"Connors' forehand\\" vs. \\"Connors's forehand\\"!! Even, eleven uses for the hyphen, who knew!!!]<br />3. But then be clear; and she slimmed down the ponderous punctuation profundities into trim crisp clean writing. Who's  core is a classic manual (hers is that's whose...)<br />4. Plus be subversively moral-normative,--but rhetorically. So she slips in here and there a modest defense of \\"pedantic sticklers,\\" a covert plea for good grammar, to woo those readers seducible into such valuation. But always lightly never overbearingly. <br />5. And do be tuneful-tuneful, do be do be do! So, she spiced things, with humor, throughout. Including her acrobatic analogies. Of which I must quote the Comma as Sheepdog: The comma \\"tears about on the hillside of language, endlessly organizing words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circling and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory `woof' to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom. Commas, if you don't whistle them down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job... good old Comma the Sheepdog.\\" (Or also as Special Policeman.)<br />So see I know how good she is. Because see, I myself, as an English teacher (and indeed a writing specialist), in an early article, made essentially the same points (about punctuation's two key functions:for clarity of message; and for tone-and-mood). [That article-not in her bibliography-would be \\"Punctuation: Phase Two, With Feeling... (Confessions of an Apostate),\\" AEB, May 1983, pp. 102-07.]<br />But being mature I'm not jealous of her book oh no not me?! Only very admiring of her scrupulous effort-her sanguine achievement.  My excellent analysis of her excellence, shows that I know how to identify good writing (my awareness is high). Now if only I (and many others) could actually write as well as she did (her actual ability and achievement is even higher)...    |;&gt;)	2004-06-18

Yeah, but We Need It	Well in this-this-here \\"tome,\\" a true Opera Queen of the Olde Schoole (as it were) reminisces about Gay Life 1945-85 from the pied-a-terre of Manhattan. Downtown becomes the standpoint from which the giddy whirl whirls... How best to describe this kaleidoscope of glimpses into the Camp sensibility? This potpourri-salmagundi-lagniappe (I just had to get into the spirit of his style...)  Well, let's try some analogies.<br />First, what is the author's genealogical \\"pedigree\\"? The author's style is perhaps Ronald Firbank out of Oscar Wilde with fertilizing whiffs of Jean Genet and William Burroughs, not to mention Andrew Holleran's denizen dancers and dance, dedicated dourly to delight or anyhow distraction. Yes McCourt's style is \\"rough\\" as in ruggedly-baroque & rocococo. Product Disclaimer: As other reviewers here prove, you do need a Certificate in Deeper Reading to enjoy this melting pot, er ah, crazy salad. \\"Abandon Literalism All Ye Who Enter Here.\\" But the style is also \\"rich\\" organic in a rather full-organ florescence...<br />Then, is the book itself, like \\"a nostalgic memorabilia trip\\"? As if the queer-temperament author climbs up to his memory-attic. And then unpacks for us his Hope Chest (or Drawers of Despair?) of recollections. Of his early life, and entering into The Life by night of gay New York, of his sojourn in England. Of historical events, personages. Above all of media: books, the theatre, and always opera, opera...  With a satchel of sachets always, and oh the ambiance, Mary...<br />Or, is reading the book like \\"doing an archaeological dig,\\" uncovering layers? Not just the dualism of straight daytime vs. queer night time. But also, we spot levels upon levels of historical allusion, shards of references to subcultures past. Hour of the wolf. The Everard baths and fire. The Homintern. Polari slang. Friends of Dorothy dancing the Madison. Cakes and ail. And too much more to mention. But always, it seems, \\"the standing-room line at the Metropolitan Opera...\\"<br />Or perhaps reading the book is like \\"walking through terrain\\"? It's varied within the hothouse botany of artifice. The forest of autobiography. Then a clearing where a duenna duet-duologue dishes diversely. Then a meadow, whereupon stage, screen, and books are played out. Then back into the orchid-greenhouse of the author's sensibility.<br />That sensibility-okay, more than not, it's non-\\"serious.\\" Oh, he does can masculine Score Points butch-assertive fashion, like when he nails the problems with Joe Ackerly's biographer-he incisively takes a stand, using psychoanalysis and other insights well. (And his occasional Alter Ego can slap his silly self upside the sensibility, a gyroscope...) But the majority is camping on the old camp ground tonight and always. Always at one remove; and yet scoring some Truth-points even at the distance he must maintain. But, Tooo Much? Ultimately is more, less? Does it all become styrofoam filigree upon a tinfoil plakk? [{\\"Behind the surface, not more surface, but...\\"}] Could it get depressingly tiresome, this Peter Pan who never grew up? This Peter the pumpkin eater who turned into a carriage at 1 A.M., \\"the party's over,\\" but this polyglot curliqueue Johnnie was so long at the fair...<br />Oh sure the moralists could condemn this embroidery. But, We Need This Too. Set it precious preserved on the culture shelf as a resource after all, yes...  McCourt's intertextual but also \\"sort of unique\\" vision becomes valid-enough. Not at all beloved nor permitted by authoritarian regimes such as the Taliban and others nearer to home. Therefore it's \\"sublimation in the service of subversiveness...\\"  If America is the melting pot, well say tossed crazy salad, well then let this crazyquilt patch belong too. Let a hundred pansies bloom, eh...	2004-02-27

(Thoreau, Melville, Whitman, Wilde, Firbank, Baldwin, and minors such as Halleck, Fuller, Van Vechten, Ford, Purdy...) But also a valuable concept of \\"gay sensibility\\" in writing. Whitaker describes this as \\"original and fresh,\\" but also \\"clever, scornful of laws, introspective, energetic, and sexy.\\" Often it imports irony and wit. Usually also some melancholy. This concept usefully expands the concept of \\"camp,\\" and it refreshes the shopworn query, \\"But is there such a thing as gay literature,\\" etc.<br />But will \\"gay sensibility\\" last? Behind it, lay a larger \\"gay culture,\\" but Whitaker claims that this culture no longer exists or is even needed, because Gay Liberation has mainstreamed GLB folk out of overt oppression. [I would qualify this: probably so in the fast-track urban venues, but what about \\"the old lady in Dubuque,\\" or \\"some gay kid in Nebraska,\\" let alone Third World Wide?...] And so, will this \\"gay sensibility\\" in writing also fade, alas? But wait; Whitaker usefully shows that on the other hand, (1) this specific fresh critical ironic/deep stance is also a part of generally-good creative imaginative artistry as such at all times. (No matter whether its makers are so-gay, or arrow-str8, or in bi-tween, let alone \\"profoundly Other.\\") Which is good; art is complex. Also he notes that (2) even if oppression segues into Liberation Now and in the future, well heck, gays will still be a minority within a majority, which will retain the sense of complexity, of diversity indeed. [I would add that (3) male-male rapport will still also always be subtly different from male-female (yes also female-male) rapport, in bio-psycho-social terms.] So \\"gay culture\\" is always around in art, and always will be in society. Whew, a relief for some of us who like-fern bars and soufflés? No, complexity...<br />Less unique but valuable is the book noting again the idea that earlier gay writers had to encode, be dualistic and dissimulating and duplicitous to get their message across under the radar of prohibitions. And that gay readers drew great sustenance from this covert communication in an earlier wasteland. These are useful perspectives to recall, for gay history, and also for all diversity-minority-multicultural concerns as well.<br />True, Whitaker may do some special pleading as to the importance of this or that minor writer or work. A singsong jingle is perhaps not great art. But a little kind stroking for minority validification is okay; we don't need Only One Canon anyhow.<br />I found another way to enjoy the book, as not just a journal of this young writer's responses, but a diary of his own identity or persona.  An admitted ex-hustler now apparently into writing and literary study, and just past the age of thirty, Whitaker comes across (in my biased insight or insightful bias anyhow) as one on the move, on a journey thus. Encountering the big themes of life which he sees in his dozen authors. (Even though still trudging less than halfway on the long road toward true interpersonal intimacy, mature attachment-a fact which to his credit he discloses.) So hail to this writer 30 years my own junior, on \\"our\\" open road, amid leaves of grass. Read this book to converse covertly, not only with writers of the past but also another reader in the present...	2004-01-26

Some seem more prosaic, mainly just reporting the characters' experience and its significance--though enjoyably. Others are more \\"poetic,\\" actually re-creating the emotions experienced so that the readers feel it too. Specifically in this anthology of 19 pieces, I found both types. Some were walks through nice but level, flat terrain-exposition.  A few were hikes to mountain gardens or whatever-intense (but also controlled) experience.I prefer the latter, dynamic type. But many readers will like the lower-key stories. In them, homosexual men make do, make something new, change in lesser or greater ways, in awareness, in ability. For instances:Japanese exchange students bewitch a host-family teenager (Williams). homosexual men support their friend who has an impossible crush (Herren). A man picks up another and slowly learns that love is more than for a body part (Donahue). AIDS raises its head. A seropositive nomad rants and tilts, driven to firehose sensation by despair (Healey). The disease torpedoes a Provincetown community and leads to realignments (Lisicky). Oh, and people age. Ed White and Andrew Holleran did, and their characters do, and barely make do. And more...But a few other stories here didn't remain earthbound and just report. They got airborne and re-created the complexities of the experience for us-with us readers. Loose with emotion but tight with artistry. I found a quintet of favorites thus:Read how a pre-teen, a sissy who likes Ken dolls and soccer players' legs but loses the match for the team, runs away, but then wins his own self, bursting the tape by scoring in another and off-limits arena, in an illicit but valid coming-of-age (Satyal). Read how a highschool football superstar, himself perhaps not even homosexual finds he must take an original, disapproved stand about the whole advantageous, contaminated world of sport stardom, with its alluring prestige and money, but its atrocious sham (Cullin). Read how despair at one's inhibitions can cause pressure-cooker anger splaying out terribly, but understandably (House). Read about-well, really feel-the world of the compulsive pederast, teaching in an elite boys' school yet. Feel how he moves stunned and mesmerized, a captive fascinated by sweaty and seductive teen boyness in a crisp rendering (Robinson). Finally, last but best in my book, read the astonishing account of a straight Southern woman married for 50 years to what we now call a transsexual more than a transvestite-but it's all the great stream-of-consciousness jumble of her ambivalences which the author's superb skill make fall into place for us, the kaleidoscope clearing upon general human truths (Jaffe).The editor's afterword is  a letdown. It's too long, a redundant repetitive wordy unedited too-lengthy over-extensive exposition about \\"homosexual publishing today.\\" I wish he had cut it in half and then told us why he chose the stories he did, since he did have interesting criteria. I can only say which I liked and why here.But the bottom line: if you're interested in homosexual short stories, this is not only one of the few volumes currently available. It's itself well worthwhile also. Available and worthwhile-sounds like a catch, so go cruise it and pick it up, it's willing.....	2003-11-05

(Hetero majority vs. homo deviancy.) Also conflict between young native Jesse and his emerging desires within himself, and his straight-culture family tradition. Nothing new there, a universal plot.

With gay character Cameron being seropositive and having lost lovers to AIDS, it's also about mortality, the most universal plot of all. And one done before. But Russell also does that well. He somehow weaves seamlessly the HIV-specific (Cameron's viral loads and T-cell counts, his lost lovers and friends) into the so-general precariousness of everybody, you and me.<br />Characters.

Throughout the book, Russell can interweave thematically, the echoing motif of \\"animals\\" hunted, from vegetarianism to roadkill to Jesse's tortured dreams to symbolic gay-straight warfare.<br />But what I found especially great are at least two other elements worthy of the skill of Russell (especially as seen in his The Coming Storm). Two facets of lust/love. <br />First, the yearning of fortysomething gay AIDS widower Cameron for the local boy-man Jesse. Poignantly done: not neurotic, just natural attraction to his youth and beauty-but also to his own appealing self. Is this love? Russell superbly re-creates oh the pain and ah the pleasure.<br />But especially, the depiction throughout the 300 pages of young Jesse's emerging, awakening, personal (sexual) identity. Never before in any gay fiction have I seen such a superb job of not telling about, but actually showing, \\"coming out.\\" Of monitoring felt/unfelt urges; of tracking hidden/re-hidden feelings; of tracing ins-and-outs of emotions. On almost every page, Russell inserts superbly this hint and that tint, of Jesse's response, feeling, awareness, denial. It's like sophisticated military intelligence, a Distant Early Warning system... ... or a powerfully-penetrating medical x-ray or MRI... or a chemical test sensitive to slight changes, hues, stains...  or a Case History which misses not one intricate step in the unfolding pattern. For me, this depiction of identity-emergence is Russell's top achievement here.<br />And so the book became for me, \\"literature.\\" Meaning, it did not just discuss (important and enduring) issues and emotions, but it actually \\"languaged\\" them-it installed emotions into language so that we readers not only are told, but also feel, those emotions. Simple definition of literature. But rare to achieve in practice. And for me, War Against The Animals attains a level of quality attained only by 10-15% of gay fiction. Well-the book seduced me, captivated me. I unfortunately finished it in 24 hours; its power made me intermittently pause to savor what I read and to save the rest, but then its power soon drew me right back to continue.

Kantor affirms that a relationship has many values, then offers a nine-step guide to ready oneself toward gaining it. His candid insider's view of the gay male \\"scene\\" (and psyche) incisively presents much \\"dirty laundry,\\" but only the better to wash it clean.<br />Effective? Well, he does as much as printed words can to help any gay man who is already together enough potentially to be capable of these self-improvements on his own without formal therapy. To such candidates he issues gentle wake-up calls away from general immaturity of self, and ineffectiveness in seeking a man. Become your better self for your hoped-for \\"better half.\\" (Only hope that the man you seek has also already read this book-or didn't have to...)<br />We have here considerable craftiness-not bad manipulation, just a laser-radar for finding gay men virtually everywhere. We have mature strategy and tactics. We don't have to be doormats to the other person, but we do need to be flexible, and descend from the many \\"high horses\\" which human flesh, men especially, and gay men also, are heir to. (Or as he says, balance between being \\"a shy shrinking violet and an intrusive Venus flytrap.\\")<br />So Kantor's subtle, complex, both-and view (present in his other books also) counsels balance. He says act happy but not euphoric. Be calm but not withdrawn. Be assertive but not pushy. And more.<br />Oh, and all of it seasoned with frequent (and relevant) fine flashes of the best Jewish-mother wry wit, too. Seasoned wisdom here.	2003-05-27

Too much bland starch of info, too few servings spiced with literary feel, emotion, significance.<br />In no fewer than 234 entries (in 30 chapters), I found intensity of the writer producing intensity in me, only in these five items:<br />1. Wechsberg's report on the social-gastronomic intricacies of a boiled beef restaurant in earlier Vienna. Such fussing! Such snobbery. But, such expertise!<br />2. Grigson on English food. Sad but incisive critique of her nation's failings--at that time.<br />3. E. M. Forster on ditto--cameo sketch of a perfectly awful breakfast on a train is a gem.<br />4.

Shades of Romeo and Juliet? More like the clear child of two other famous gay novels. The genealogical footprints are clear.<br />We have the politics of Jamie O'Neill's trenchant At Swim, Two Boys--during the 1917 Irish rebellion. And the passion of Gordon Merrick's treacly soft-soapy corn-porn romantic novels with Peter and Charlie, The Lord Won't Mind especially plus the others.<br />Politics are incisively present. A typical instance: grandmother says, \\"Get ye both out of here. Go to Australia like your dad should have done. It's not just that the pair of you are like what he and Samus were, but it's the fact that you are from opposite sides in this God-forsaken land. They will never let you get away with it...\\"  This oppression happens, realistically, every 15 pages or so.<br />We also have the passion of Merrick's moonery. A typical statement: \\"Dear, dearest Harry. I love you. I thank you. I adore you. You are my life, my God, my breath, my heart, I am yours till all time ends.\\" This intimacy happens, routinely, every 3 pages or so. (Right after which the two fugitive lads then walk the talk and re-cement their relationship, full-fillingly...)<br />So if you like a three-ingredient dish you may like this one. Solid nourishing stew of Irish local color and history. Spiced with tart social-political realism. But served also with a sweet-and-sweet sauce of Romance on the side. To spoon on.	2003-03-17

Well, different readers will surely see the same book differently, that&iexcl;¯s for sure&iexcl;­  Most other reviewers here brightly praise Holleran&iexcl;¯s style and also substance. (&iexcl;°Acute social vision,&iexcl;± Witty, shrewd&iexcl;±&iexcl;­) I seem to see more darkly.<br />I see a major (and troubling) element others don&iexcl;¯t discuss&iexcl;ªheck, don&iexcl;¯t even notice? I see pervasive pessimism about life-chances, one&iexcl;¯s relationship to his own biography. I also see pathology about interactions, one&iexcl;¯s relationship to others&iexcl;ªin this case, to other gay men&iexcl;­<br />These twin &iexcl;°incompletenesses&iexcl;± seem&iexcl;ªto me only, perhaps&iexcl;ªpervasive, and also problematic. Most of these characters seem doubly &iexcl;°drifty.&iexcl;± They eddy through their lives, decades largely without change, growth, achievement. And they edge away from others, from true mature relationships in what I feel is classic &iexcl;°defensive detachment.&iexcl;± (Are these triste tales, dangerous ammunition for anti-gay elements who want to misperceive all homosexuality as psychopathological, dirty laundry indeed?)<br />But am I mis-judging complexity here? 1. Are these dark elements &iexcl;°what life is really like,&iexcl;± straight and gay&iexcl;ªand it&iexcl;¯s better to know it? 2. Or is this the undiscussed underside of much gay male life, suppressed by Political Correctness? 3. Or is author Holleran selectively mis-perceiving gay male life thus through his own smudged lens&iexcl;ªand I the reader am also overemphasizing this downside and wrongly chiding Holleran for this unanalyzed, uncritical portrait of pathologies?)<br />A few examples from the stories may illustrate (not justify) my alarmed &iexcl;°minority report&iexcl;± here:<br />(1) Biographical change, growth, achievement? --But in &iexcl;°Penthouse,&iexcl;± the character says something like a party is over&iexcl;ªbut he didn&iexcl;¯t know where to go next. --Worse, in &iexcl;°Hamburger Man,&iexcl;± a character says so many of these (homosexual) men have wasted their lives. &iexcl;°Not the drugs, or the houses in Acapulco, or the small talk&iexcl;ªthe waste! Of energy and talent, love and ambition!&iexcl;± --In another, &iexcl;°You will go on living from crisis to crisis, and eventually self-destruct!&iexcl;± And Freud is quoted noting &iexcl;°people who waste their lives pursuing things that cannot possibly provide happiness.&iexcl;± --In &iexcl;°Sentimental Education,&iexcl;± &iexcl;°his life was simply a bland tale of frienship, affairs, money borrowed and loaned, all of it leading nowhere except to the inevitable disillusionment of age.&iexcl;± Flaubert is quoted, noting that in a life, nothing happens except a lot of little unworthy stuff upon which that life is wasted.<br />Perhaps this is gritty realism: is much life like this? Or is it accentuated in the gay male subculture which Holleran sketches. Homosexuality as pathological? (Or at least, simply what happens when men the roamers and rovers interact with other men not the domesticating women?)<br />--In &iexcl;°Housesitter,&iexcl;± a character laments stasis. &iexcl;°We&iexcl;¯ll never regard each other as anything but fantasies, we&iexcl;¯ll never integrate sex with the rest of our lives, we&iexcl;¯re just going to keep on going to gyms and dance clubs, taking drugs, dancing, and cruising the Rambles.&iexcl;± All the same just more dull.<br />(2) Are initial male-male interactions easy or difficult? --In &iexcl;°Key West,&iexcl;± we see two middle-aged men on a date after their aged parents had died: &iexcl;°as fragile as flowers, as set in their ways as cement.&iexcl;± I applaud Holleran for his accurate snapshot, however depressing&iexcl;­.<br />(--In &iexcl;°Delancey Place,&iexcl;± the tone gets worse. Well-adjusted people don&iexcl;¯t do well in the bars, to get cruised you have to be in a really rotten mood, people don&iexcl;¯t look for nice guys with a friendly open face, but instead, those complicated, dangerous, neurotic.)<br />(3) What about good male-male friendships? --In &iexcl;°Amsterdam,&iexcl;± a ten-year friendship collapses, largely due to one character&iexcl;¯s gross misperceptions of the other, for whatever motivations. &iexcl;°Instead of comforting, joking laughing, commiserating and encouraging, we were going our separate ways.\\"<br />(4) Are long-lasting mature male-male relationships possible or probable? --In &iexcl;°Blorts,&iexcl;± Joshua has a good education, job, friends, physique, but no lover. Suitors appear, but &iexcl;°Joshua always found something wrong with him; primarily, I suspect, the fact that he liked Joshua.&iexcl;±<br />(5) Is change and growth possible after realizations? No, all the stories do not end on lives wasted and other people not attached to. Two or three end with some &iexcl;°possibility of grace.&iexcl;± However, most of these people seem not open to change and growth, even after insight. --In &iexcl;°Sentimental Education,&iexcl;± a character has an epiphany. &iexcl;°He who had once believed that sex was the means by which he engaged Life now wondered if it had not been the way he avoided it.&iexcl;± An open door? But the story ends with the character appreciating Flaubert&iexcl;¯s comment: &iexcl;°What can compare with the joy of waking up beside someone you had never seen before and know you will never see again?&iexcl;±<br />--And in &iexcl;°Key West,&iexcl;± the lonely character&iexcl;¯s old friend Lee was &iexcl;°still good, still kind, still compassionate,&iexcl;± which is now more important than his good looks of years ago. An open path? But the story ends with the character looking at Lee asleep in the next room and then &iexcl;°Next year, he thought, Caracas.&iexcl;± In short, more discontented detached drifting?<br />Glum glimpses indeed, these stories. Do they raise key issues for responding to literature? As stated above, is this The Truth about human lives? About many gay male lives? About Holleran&iexcl;¯s skewed view of same? Or are these stories sunny and I completely misread&iexcl;ªor does the current gay-lib and P.C. tone of the times, acceptance of diversity and the like, majorly block any discussion, let alone perception, of real problems here?<br />I read these stories with clinical interest. Things are indeed bad, as this, yes; but things are not always this bad and in any case can be aimed for better.

I thought I knew \\"all about\\" the various ways fiction can be written, but this book showed me a way new to me--whether it's the best way or not?... The book's pattern first eluded me, then confused/annoyed me, then \\"worked\\" well enough for me. The pattern is to build via plot-twists: suddenly-emerging changes or new appearances. Like the reader is always made to turn some abrupt corner into a development NOT carefully-foreshadowed. Not unbelievable, just emerging with a jolt. Is this method a cheap shot and thus confusing? or truthful to life-events after all?<br />For instance, suddenly \\"bang\\" Prescott College up and closes its doors, due to money problems. Nobody saw it coming. Then suddenly \\"bang\\" Vince who had been training to be a militant gay terrorist, up and drops his violence to work within the system. Who knew or even suspected? Then suddenly \\"bang\\" Harlan's son re-enters his life, then \\"bang\\" is condemned for this by his homophobic family, then \\"bang\\" it's okay after all.<br />After a dozen or so out-of-the-blue twists-and-turns like these, I for one started to feel yanked around on some chain or other. What ever happend to good fiction's organic gradual evolution of elements with foreshadowings?<br />And yet author Warren DOES work these slam-bang eruptions thematically. Idea-wise, she makes each new event carefully carry truths, both gay-specific and also human-general. And emotion-wise, Warren does make the sudden shift contain its emotion which she did not fabricate up, but truly felt, via punch plus empathy.<br />So after all, the novel did end up working for me the picky (?) fiction-buff--at least mostly. It will probably work even better for \\"you,\\" those readers who are more open to varied fictional forms. Enjoy Patricia Nell Warren's stamp of style--if not the first tier of fiction, still suave and sensitive after her fashion which her fans love.	2002-10-16

I like not just facts or data, but key concepts or ideas--and this book has them, in spades. BUT I also like concrete material--specific examples, actual instances. Such illustrations of ideas, help me (1) comprehend the concepts, (2) see the crucial importance or &quot;so-what&quot; the difference the concepts make to some exigency, (3) to see how to apply or use the concepts, and (4) to read with more lively interest. And so, here's to the happy blending of the idea and the instance. (&quot;Poetry is abstraction blooded.&quot;)<br />Unfortunately, many academic treatises float in the abstract stratosphere without ever descending to an earth-like instance. <br />This book is, alas, no exception. I clambered through the aerial crags of concept after concept (and no sense WHY this matters), and found only ONE specific example.<br />That of--a &quot;thermometer.&quot; That's right--and I'm not even sure to what point....<br />Fortunately I discovered Semiotics for Beginners, by Daniel Chandler. &quot;You could, too.&quot;	2002-10-15

Books	2	1	2	N	N	Maybe The Wrong &quot;Kline&quot; Cited	I can't discern the precise purpose/audience of this volume. Not a how-to for either teachers or researchers. Nor, I fear, an orientation introduction for generalists. Probably useful as a generously-deep historical survey from the author's own standpoints. He cites the important work of S. J. Kline on &quot;conceptual foundations&quot; of integrative work (1995). But he seems (I may have missed it) to overlook the book Interdisciplinarity by Julie Thompson Klein (1990). I would strongly recommend that semi-standard reference (along with Wm. Newell's edited anthology Interdisciplinarity: Essays From The Literature) as much better orientation and starting points for a &quot;familiarization tour&quot; of the complex field of interdisciplinary endeavor.<br />The above is only my &quot;considered opinion.&quot; True, I studied both anthropology and literature, then wrote on interdisciplinary endeavor, then taught it in college. Still, only my opinion--well, let's say &quot;reasoned judgment.&quot;	2002-05-14

Something for many tastes. But mainly it's (4) the emotion in up to half of the stories. These fold feeling into their plots, and justify the book. And it's artistic emotion: both intense, and calmly controlled, hence earned, achieved. Brash rebel editor Hartnett in the Intro, turns into calm skilled editor Hartnett in the anthology itself...<br />These worked for me. I mean, take the one about a drug-stoked foursome after a late party. I can't forget actually seeing, not just being told about, the quartet's mood of being perfectly barmy balmy blasted, and swooningly-blitzed...<br />In another one, I can't forget realizing, not being informed about, how the younger man will surely leave the older one, in a few months' time, though not a word was spoken...<br />Then I can't forget virtually experiencing, not being lectured about, the real, believable pain of multiple-minority identity conflects between a Nigerian and an Afro-Caribbean pair...<br />Nor can I forget observing up close, not in a recollection, how a gay guy who escaped his stifling small town, returns and sees the pain of his friend still living his cramped buried life, although now accidently outed to his loathsome mates...<br />And many others. A portrait of an obsessively-clinging dependent type. A chronicle of a guy sneakily setting his cap to snare as a lover, a rising star, even a Member of Parliament...<br />There's even more variety, but you get the point. Oh, as good as any is editor Harnett's own story. It snapshots perfectly, ephebephile youths (well, randy bratty adolescents) and their frustrated admirers. But with a twist: why, why is best-buddy Michael so distant nowadays from the young narrator? (and we can't tell, but that's subtlety not trickery).<br />True, not perfect; I found some slim dubious stories here. A couple of snuff-tales, plus gratuitous nothing-scenes, plus some confusing. Some frothy: \\"Uncle Deborah\\" is a transvestite tricker. Others run more conventional: the Indian student comes out bravely, the priest goes re-closeted after all. In a park, older but radical gays face-off to obtusely homophobic journalists.<br />But the emotionalized stories carry the day. A good tossed-salad of British-toned, gay-flavored, stories.	2001-12-19

Parent-reactions: macho-explosive dad, tearful-bewildered mom (then PFLAG-founding mom!)...  Knee-jerk harrassment of &quot;different&quot; kids by their &quot;peers,&quot; and worse, the risk that school authorities will senselessly crush the emerging Gay-Straight Alliance (that would be &quot;child abuse,&quot; but we're on the cusp of social change here)...

Why did he erect barriers to wrap his point away from sight? First, the convoluted dialect of Danny his hero. Plus the hero himself: who can relate to a 12-year-old grossly overweight due to hormone imbalance? Let alone to the setting of white-trash California in 1947?<br />But then a minor magic happened. I saw real literature emerge, in Danny's first-person account of his trials and tribulations in his emerging life. Behind the barriers noted, real life and truths and a genuine valid response to them. Neither oversolemn preaching, not too-flamboyant flaring, either.<br />Is the book a &quot;cult classic&quot; as earlier reviews here suggested? Well, maybe/maybe not... But  the book solidly echoes some traditions in literature. (1) Main Character: an overweight satirist? Well, think John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces-shrill in parts compared to this book. (2) Setting? The curlique-tattered environment of languor. Think early Truman Capote stories in the south. (3) Language-style? The diction-Danny speaks in his own &quot;idiolect&quot; (personal language) comprised of erudite diction charmingly misallopropped at times, and lavish punctuation-capitals, parentheses-and free-range syntax unabashed by grammar fences. For this, think William Burroughs' Naked Lunch, with its combo amalgam of babytalk, pre-Spanglish, drug diction, so-gai camp, and what else...<br />Of course I'm biassed there. I speak/write in my own amalgamated idiolect of polyvalent dictations myself, so I especially enjoy Donny's verbalacities such as the following typical enough:<br />\\"Why do explicit persons talk so mean to We Children?! Even although I am almost 6 feet of height plus look a whole alots older due to Department and Premature Pubescence then 12. I am only 1 humane boy!\\"<br />Danny trials, he tribulates, he triumphs. A lively plot whereby the radio heroine is unmasked, Danny finally beats up the bully, and awakens transformed in the hospital, and as for his \\"unattainable\\" heartthrob Fred?!...  General human issues somehow validated amid the specifics of grotesque, frank burlesque, and Local Color. Or, wait-perhaps not in spite of, but by means of?! Amazingly, the book ended up on my All-Favorites shelf (secondary position, admittedly). Author O'Malley has, if not genius, at least the talent of an  individual artistic vision which shapes mundane subjects. Last I heard, that was, like, &quot;literature.&quot;	2001-12-03

Do you like John Updike's dissonant couples the Maples? John Cheever's middle-class suburban sashayings? John O'Hara's accounts of evil-propelled mis-treatments and non-treatments? Ring Lardner's tales of hamfisted bunglings? Katherine Mansfield's dry-point etchings of looming males and tendril-like females?<br />To these I can now add Dorothy Parker--whom I discovered only last month after enjoying the above social-critics for decades. A sharp-tongued journalist, Parker wrote in New York City in the 1920's through the 1950's. She's a key addition to the &quot;fruit salad&quot; of these writers--call her a lime, perhaps--small, tart, acid but somehow quenching our thirst for the truth however tangy?<br />Parker precisely pinpoints interpersonal shipwrecks. Marriage is--what happens. Often it's like this:<br />In &quot;New York to Detroit,&quot; on the telephone, a man mechanically shoves a desperate woman out of his life. The bad connection aids his &quot;misunderstandings&quot; of her frantic pleas.<br />In &quot;Here We Are,&quot; a just-married couple travel by train to their New York City honeymoon hotel. But we see already the stress-fractures of immature overreactions, and how out of them starts to ooze the lava of hatred which will surely melt down (or burn out) the marriage soon.<br />In &quot;Too Bad,&quot; women are perplexed, even astonished, that the Weldons separated. Such an ideal couple! Except Parker eavesdrops us into the couple's typical evening at home. Its genteel vacancy, polite non-communication, and quiet distancing tell the tale.<br />Is Parker too crude a caricaturist? Heavy on the satire, too bitter personally? True, her women seem simplified: helplessly-hysterical, nice-nice faceless patseys or creampuffs, captives of bland routines--and of men. Her men similarly seem generic males-of-the-species, &quot;blunt bluff hearty and...meaningless,&quot; conventionally-whiskered and all, chauvinistically-insensitive if not cruel. Okay... But if it's overdone, why do I feel I have known and seen these people, or traces of them, often, and not in New York of the 1920's-1950's either?	2001-08-24

Webster's says &quot;poetry&quot; is concentrated imaginative language. And &quot;gay&quot; would relate to minority-group experience? I don't see very much high poetic quality here, nor explicit references to gay perspectives (not just sexuality, but &quot;diversity&quot; of viewpoints).<br />Oh, some are good. John Weiners' confessionals. Dan Bellm's &quot;Boy Wearing A Dress&quot; on gender-identity. James Schuyler's chatty &quot;Who Is Nancy Daum&quot; is a bracelet of imagery-stones. Wayne Koestenbaum's campily-operatic intonations.<br />But too many times (to use an analogy) it's a flatland of prose, lacking poetic mountain-vistas. Like Frank O'Hara: &quot;Lana Turner has collapsed!...I have been to lots of parties / and acted perfectly disgraceful / but I never actually collapsed / oh Lana Turner we love you get up.&quot; Like Taylor Mead: &quot;I came pretty close to / upchuking [sic], Chuck.&quot; Like Jack Anderson's &quot;Partial Index to Myself&quot;: &quot;B Bach ballet bark worse than a bite bed befuddlement birthdays.&quot; Like too many more.<br />Nor does the anthology show gay presence, experience, response. Editor Liu says, &quot;I still question the notion of a 'gay sensibility.'&quot; He was &quot;simply interested in documenting a particular and peculiar time in contemporary American poetry, turf notwithstanding.&quot;<br />Fine, but why, plus why call it gay? I wandered through pages of non-gay scenes--like walking through fields without a &quot;hint of mint&quot; (to use an analogy plus an allusion). Too bad: minority poetry (Blacks, Native Americans, etc.) can give the &quot;outsider&quot; vision. And the selections from Dennis Cooper, Thom Gunn, Edward Field, and Frank O'Hara are not the memorable gay-imbued visions I recall.<br />What went wrong, if it did? Editor Liu seems underinvolved in the project. Talisman House approached him &quot;to edit an anthology.&quot; And &quot;after some thought I decided that an anthology of gay American poetry would best suit my energies.&quot; Not the decades-long project which Gavin Dillard claimed was his anthology A DAY FOR A LAY.<br />Good-quality gay poetry does exist. But artistic excellence is often eclipsed today by either political &quot;relevance&quot; (which seriously damaged the Larkin and Morse anthology GAY AND LESBIAN POETRY IN OUR TIME) or flat-prose conversation chopped up into lines and masquing as poetry. Still, do visit Liu's garden for the few but definite poetic and gay-blooming flowers which do grow there....	2001-08-23

Who wants reminders of the real oppression back then? Like, arrest-gay sex (even in private) was illegal, and police raids on pubs plus blackmail flourished, with risk of career-ruin. Like, social stigma-it was &quot;abnormal,&quot; a neurosis. Like, the &quot;Double Life&quot;-more &quot;inverts&quot; than not, lived schizophrenically closeted except for their &quot;underground&quot; connections.... This pre-Stonewall scene of constant unease, apprehension, danger would be a bummer, downer, drag even to read about, right?<br />Wrong, in the talented hands of writer Rodney Garland (yes, necessarily a pseudonym!). Good fiction is dramatized with conflict-action-suspense. To the max, Garland skillfully exploits every ounce of the above &quot;dismal&quot; earlier-time situation to create a &quot;dramatic&quot; almost timeless good read filled with human drama thus.<br />The \\"meat\\" of the backbone-plot lets Garland parade the people and the possibilities. Dr. Tony Page, a psychiatrist, finds that his close friend (and yes, one-time lover) Julian Leclerc, has committed suicide. And so, for self-protection from blackmail/exposure, Tony goes on the trail of finding out why. To this plot add the \\"seasonings,\\" as Tony's quest lets a whole parade of people emerge. It's a Hogarth-portrait of &quot;homosexuality in urban England then.&quot; Julian's business-partner, married and utterly clueless....Anne, Julian's equally-naïve fiance AND Tony's patient....Julian's army-officer father, homophobic but broken....And a whole gallery of friends-and-lovers of Julian and of Tony. Ron the &quot;questioning&quot; tough, Ginger the married bloke, Hugh Harpley the flitting fairy, a Scotland Yard detective who himself is gay (talk about undercover-undercover). And let us not forget Terry, the hunky blond and sweet houseboy of Tony's.....<br />So Garland uses the Gay Thing plus British social class-consciousness to enhance suspense and intrigue, via knowledge-vs.-suspicion-vs.-secrets-vs.-mystery. As for specifically gay, &quot;who knows about me, who doesn't or do they, who sort of knows? As for general social class, the novel richly employs the British novel's (and society's) keen deep hyper-awareness of class (lower, middle, upper) as a key primary marker of identity. We see Dr. Page reading the situations for clues, not only of sexual orientation, but of social status. Clothing, speech and accent, lifestyle all &quot;peg&quot; the person in rank. (Heavens, was lower-class status as stigmatizing as queerness?)<br />&quot;Chef&quot; Garland takes equal parts of social danger-risk-oppression, various personality-types, and class-consciousness. Bakes all together and serves up a flavorful read indeed. I wish more fiction (novels, stories) had this book's dynamic conflict-action-suspense so carefully, but effortlessly, built into every chapter. Oppressed, oppressive gay London in the 1950's is transformed into a good story thus.	2001-05-16

I know, sounds dry-but it may help you decide whether you want to read this book. I'm \\"half-glad\\" I did, and here's why.<br />GENRE-BLENDING. (No, not \\"gender-blending\\"!) The editor feels that \\"personal essay\\" and \\"short story, fiction\\" are becoming fused, interblended, and so, indistinguishable. But this is simply incorrect-and saying so, harms both genres. An essay is (and remains) a personal-voiced informally-structured exploration-and-sharing. A story (traditionally) glimpses a dynamic created world, with plot (including events: action, suspense), complications-and-resolutions). And with characters (with conflicts-and-resolutions). And with setting (to be experienced). And all not told-to-us, but shown to us to see for ourselves. Oh, admittedly the \\"New Journalism\\" added fiction to news stories (as has the more recent \\"creative non-fiction\\"), for enrichment. Still, I miss the traditional dynamic story in many of this anthology's selections. However, YOU may enjoy the lyrical essay-plus-story-plus poem feel of many of them. So.<br />Traditionally-taught, tight stories I enjoyed were the semi-understated \\"The Cosmology of Bing,\\" an appropriately-dismal tale of an alcoholic astronomer's denial of his sexuality. \\"Hunters and Gatherers\\" makes the ironic maximum out of a straight  (but ?) husband-and-father inviting some gay and lesbian friends over for dinner. And especially \\"The Rose City\\" nails and impales Roland Dott, as sad a case of \\"attachment-disorder narcissism\\" you'd hope to find, cheating on lover after lover, forever looking for his \\"Hubby-Hub.\\" (One of my three favorite gay short stories of all time, the others being Stanley Kaufmann's \\"Fulvous Yellow,\\" and Patrick Hochtel's \\"Baseball in July.\\")<br />SUBJECT-MATTER. Should a story in a \\"gay\\" anthology include gay characters, plot, setting? I would think so. So, why the stories about stealing Mrs. Abraham Lincoln's teacups? About a Chinese mental-health patient at the center? About an Irish judge deciding against a pregnant schoolgirl's right to remain in the school? Any \\"gay\\" content here flew subliminally below my radar screen anyhow. And one about a young single mother's slowly going blind-but with only a token gay character?<br />EXCERPTS. Should an anthology contain only self-complete stories, or can it include excerpts from novels? Usually I feel \\"no excerpts please.\\" But the two excerpts here, \\"Bing\\" plus the one about the two Jewish brothers, do seem to ride complete.<br />SO-if you like good short-story fiction, plus lyrical poetic-prose pieces, even meandering essay-voices, occasionally more magical-fantastic than realistic-enjoy this collection now!	2001-05-16
US	51224960	R2IWAK43JWKYQI	0345410033	269581555	Games People Play: The Basic Handbook of Transactional Analysis.	Books	5	236	248	N	N	Sparky Stories, But Wry Wit and Overlooked Wisdom Too....	&quot;Thank Psyche,&quot; that this 1963 classic is still in print. (600,000 copies; N.Y.Times best-seller list for two years.) It's not trendy and forgettable, it's timeless and fascinating. (Here are our human &quot;GAMES&quot; such as &quot;Kick Me,&quot; &quot;Ain't It Awful,&quot; and &quot;Happy to Help&quot;)<br />But two more subtle pleasures (which the other reviewers here have not yet mentioned) are the doctor's wry WIT-plus real WISDOM.<br />His thesis is uncompromising. Dr. Berne shows we play &quot;games&quot; taught us by our warped childhood, or the world and culture. Rock-bottom: &quot;Because there is so little opportunity for intimacy in daily life, and because some forms of intimacy (especially if intense) are psychologically impossible for most people, the bulk of the time in serious social life is taken up with playing games. Hence games are both necessary and desirable, and the only problem at issue is whether the games played by an individual offer the best yield for him.&quot; Specifically, Berne says we should discard bad psychological games (based on invalid old life-scripts from the past), in favor of the better social games. (And indeed, the games seem giddily-toxic, especially &quot;Look How Hard I've Tried,&quot; &quot;See What You Made Me Do,&quot; and &quot;I'm Only Trying To Help You&quot;)<br />So alas, for the intimacy-fearful MANY people, the goal-in-life is to cure the &quot;sick&quot; games, and then just play the non-pathological ones. But, for a FEW fortunates, the open-calm-easy-natural responsiveness of truer psychological maturity IS possible. Berne names it &quot;autonomy.&quot; It comprises awareness, spontaneity, and intimacy.<br />Okay. Skim or skip the theoretical Part ONE. But savor the 106 games in the story-time Part TWO. I mean, who can resist such peppery plots as &quot;Courtroom,&quot; &quot;Frigid Woman,&quot; and &quot;Now I've Got You, You SOB&quot;?) And then ponder Part THREE, on true autonomy: wow. Berne notwithstanding, many CAN arrive toward truer autonomy. (I know. I did. It took me decades. Worth the trip.....)<br />But don't miss Dr. Berne's wry WIT. He tempers his pessimism by his dubious, ironic, &quot;hopeful realism&quot; you might say. I found irresistible such low-key, laconic gems about the Human Condition such as these:<br />(1) &quot;She and her husband had little in common besides their household worries and the children, so that their quarrels stood out as important events; it was mainly on these occasions that they had anything but the most casual conversations.&quot;<br />(2) [On the difference between mathematical and psychological games:] &quot;Mathematical game analysis postulates players who are completely rational. Transactional game analysis deals with games which are un-rational, or even irrational, and hence more real.&quot;<br />(3) &quot;'Beautiful friendships' are often based on the fact that the players complement each other with great economy and satisfaction, so that there is a maximum yield with a minimum of effort from the games they play with each other.&quot;<br />(4) (On the game &quot;I'm Only Trying To Help You&quot;: a welfare agency worker and her client.) &quot;There was a tacit agreement between the worker and the client which read as follows: W: I'll try to help you (providing you don't get better). C: I'll look for employment (providing I don't have to find any). If a client broke the agreement by getting better, the agency lost a client, and the client lost his welfare benefits, and both felt penalized....&quot;<br />(5) (On the game &quot;If It Weren't For You&quot;:) &quot;(1) On the surface: Mr. White: You stay home and take care of the house. Mrs. White: If it weren't for you, I could be out having fun. (2) But in reality: Mr. White: You must always be here when I get home. I'm terrified of desertion. Mrs. White: I will be if you help me avoid phobic situations.&quot;<br />(6) (On the game &quot;Wooden Leg&quot; or thedefensive, resistant &quot;what do you expect of a man with a wooden leg?&quot;) &quot;Slightly more sophisticated are such pleas as: What do you expect of a man who (a) comes from a broken home (b) is neurotic (c) is in analysis or (d) is suffering from a disease known as alcoholism? These are topped by, &quot;If I stop doing this (neurotic behavior), I won't be able to analyze it, and then I'll never get better.&quot; The obverse of &quot;Wooden Leg&quot; is &quot;Rickshaw,&quot; with the thesis, &quot;If they only had (rickshaws) (duckbill platypuses) (girls who spoke ancient Egyptian) around this town, I never would have got into this mess.&quot;<br />Aaaach, Dr. Eric, your demeanor-dubious, doubtful, disenchanted and yet also dedicated and doughty-is worthy even of the Master himself, Dr. Sigmund, indeed.....<br />And then the goal of it all, &quot;AUTONOMY.&quot; Learning to see a teapot, hear the birds sing (and interact with self and others) in the way YOU yourself were meant to, directly. And NOT the way society, culture, your family, and the grubby benefits of game-playing tell you you should!....Four times in as many decades have I re-read Berne's description of this &quot;autonomy.&quot; And each time I see more-because I'm slowly-surely getting closer and closer to autonomy. To this natural, friction-free, appreciative, mellow, engaged, honest, for-real interaction with self and others. (Of course, I had the benefit of useful and skilled psychotherapy in the interval.) But take heart: a long road can have arrival points. Dr. Berne points the way, with the wisdom and wry wit, the doubting but dedicated stance, of the best in the psychoanalytic tradition.	2001-05-16
US	51224960	RMTPP3AWAX0JJ	0300011199	721753505	Collected Poems	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Utterly-Conversational Talky Poet of Unique Voice-Tone!	Well, I DID want to tell you why Dugan's one of my six most-favorite poets. It's because of his VOICE. His TONE-of-talking. Theme-wise, he navigates well the socio-political chaos and absurdity of the parlous present, but heck how CHATTILY, how CONVERSATIONALLY, he talks about it! LOQUACIOUSLY rattling on in that inimitable street-corner buttonholing TONE of his, wry, wacky, discouraged-but-upbeat, all in arm-gesturing and eyebrow-raising SPEECH-STYLE. <br />But no....you see that I can't tell or INFORM you why Dugan's voice appeals-can I, now. So I better ILLUSTRATE his &quot;urban-yawpy&quot; tone unique as his fingerprint, with selected snippets quoted directly. So enough of praising secondhand, here are some selected SOUND-BITES from Dugan himself. They do present, I feel, what I'd call his stamp-of-style, namely &quot;DICTY&quot; (as in Take Dictation of the GENIALLY-GARRULOUS speech as she is spoken....)<br />(Heck, if you went no further than the poems' TITLES, they themselves carry Dugan's colloquial spritziness.  Such as &quot;What Happened? What Do You Expect?&quot; And, &quot;Transcribed Conversation in Praise of Cows.&quot; And, &quot;Winter's Onset from an Alienated Point of View.&quot; But check out choice sound-bites such as the following:)<br />(1) HISTORY &amp; SOCIETY. Dugan is on the lively move:<br />&quot;Whatever was living is dead and a lot of what was dead has begun to move around, so who knows what the plan for a good state is: they all go out on the roads!&quot;<br />&quot;He dreamed America up, and I played Indian against his cowboy lies because: tradition is for the rich to love, the clerks to ape, the poor to suffer, so I wander to take the air, regards, and joys....&quot;<br />&quot;Some barbarian raped some peasant woman who produced a child who ultimately produced you and me, so there is this family continuity, so don't cry, it's obvious, look around!....&quot;<br />&quot;She's grateful, but goes out with a bruiser. Blood passions arise and die in lawyers' smiles, a few children suffer for life, and that's all....&quot;<br />(2) DAILY EXUBERANCE. Dugan has got it, and he shares it:<br />&quot;Then it was Saturday, Saturday, Saturday! Love must be the reason for the week! We went shopping! I saw clouds! The children explained everything! I could talk about the main thing!&quot;....<br />&quot;After long-haired women have unwired their pencil-pierced buns, it's an event with pennants when the Great Falls of emotion say that beauty is in residence, grand in her hotel of flesh,....&quot;<br />(3) SEASONAL SPRIGHTLINESSES. Dugan is attuned to weather--outer, and \\"inner\\":<br />&quot;The wind came in for several thousand miles all night and changed the close lie of your hair this morning....No wonder your laugh rings like a chisel as it cuts your children's new names in the tombstone of thin air.&quot;<br />&quot;In fall and whiskey weather when the eye clears with the air and blood comes up to surface for one last time....All appetites revive and love is possible again in clarity without the sweats of heat;....&quot;<br />&quot;The first cold front came in whining like a carpenter's plane and curled the warm air up the sky: winter is for busy work, summer for construction....&quot;<br />&quot;The first cold front came through Indian Summer and blew the autumn foliage show away along with the drunks, addicts, crooks, and weaker regulars from Washington Square Park....If he drank another bottle of that stuff oh he'd be warm enough for a while in the southern California of its first gold rush....&quot;<br />(4) The Times are TRICKY, but TALK TRUE about them anyhow. Dugan faces up:<br />&quot;After this oracle there will be no more oracles. The precinct is hereby desanctified. You wanted it, you have it. From now on everything I say will be a lie for cash. Now, for the last time, here's the truth:....&quot;<br />(Here's one complete brief poem, entitled &quot;Passing Through The Banford Tolls&quot;) &quot;Proceeding sidewise by inattention I arrive unknowingly at an unsought destination and pass it by wondering: what next?&quot;<br />(Oh but Dugan walks-and-talks less severely, more sanguine, than that there. As in the following, which perhaps capstones his judicious exuberance of voice direct:) &quot;Oh I don't know what happened but I wish I did because I did it, right? Wrong. Is everything all right? Yes. No. Rest in the mystery. Begin a new day.&quot;<br />You ever ride on such a custom-styled onrush of brash-but bright LOQUACITY as Dugan's Dictations? In the talkfest of poets, an utterly distinctive note.....	2001-05-16

I saw how the CIA's CMC exam is a week of making good chefs stumble, rush, reconsider, improvise, balance a dozen variables, and try to clear the hurdles of preparing complex menus in limited time--both error-free and excellence-freighted. See for yourself.<br />(2) What's running a top-ranked restaurant like? Lola's in Cleveland demands near-impossible coordinating by its chef, one of the recent &quot;ten best new&quot; chefs nationwide. To orchestrate new menus--overbookings--airconditioning and other failures--mistakes when a famous food critic visits--staff training and rapport.....it's all depicted here. Read it for yourself and see if maybe the grueling daily routine of the &quot;prep cook&quot; alone makes you glad (as it did me) that each day, I cook only for two or more, not complexly for 250.<br />(3) What is culinary genius? The chef of California's French Laundry seeks and touches perfection, in combining then curating ingredients. No, Ruhlman doesn't define Chef Keller's rationale--but see for yourself how he shows the magic close-up anyhow.<br />I am no food-writing expert. And so perhaps other books do as well or better in depicting high-quality chef activity. But I am fascinated by food specifically, and also by &quot;excellence-in-quality&quot; generally. And so I found the book well worth my time. Ruhlman is a sometime cook--but I think, from his work here, is now becoming a truly all-time, professional, nonfiction writer.	2001-02-20

And now, he's older, too.<br />And all this shows in his work, his poems? But short of spoiling them? The book offers 40 poems. Subjects include father, politics, Paris, movies, the male member and its long-standing friends, and etc. Their tone often seems only half-affirmative, often more-than-half-resigned. (But he is direct and honest, even if dogged and dour!) And their language seems (to me) non-poetic, flat, prosy--as if prose paragraphs were chopped up to emjamb into poetry-stanzas, and the images de-tuned too. (But they do sing his own voice!)<br />So maybe one reader will feel that &quot;Edward feels overmuch sorry for himself and it all,&quot; while another may feel that Field explores his semi-sorry situation thoughtfully, candidly, complexly, wherever it leads.<br />Then the last 147 of the book's 228 pages are &quot;The Poetry File,&quot; prose-diary jottings. A secondary thread herein is gay-artist gossip entitled &quot;Tales of the Closet.&quot; This serves up the dish on such as Ashberry, Auden, R. Brooke, P. Goodman, Isherwood, Kallman, Merrill, Norse, Frank O'Hara, S.Spender, M. Swenson....But the primary thread is poetry itself. Field quarrels confusingly with the Poetry Establishment which he seems simultaneously to reject and envy equally. About his own work, he's laconically-downbeat. &quot;The curse of poetry is that it must be poetry. When I give a poetry reading, I hope they don't notice it's poetry....I have to say again that my poems often embarrass me....&quot; The E-z Cynic and Points-Scoring Critic can easily retort to this: That's because your stuff is indeed scarcely poetic!&quot; But others might say: well, the minor-key tone of his own voice does emerge.<br />I myself describe &quot;poetry&quot;as &quot;triple intensity.&quot; More feeling than usual, first in the poet, then into the language, then in the reader at last. On this score, Field does make it to poetry--just, and modestly.<br />(Still, don't overlook his feats &quot;Nancy&quot; and &quot;The Moving Man.&quot; Although neither is in this volume, both are deliciously transgressive romps. And remember that Field capably edited the overlooked 1975 classic anthology, A Geography Of Poets. Therein he included plain-talky diction...racy pop images...and curlique imagery also. All poetically intense.)	2000-12-16

Roberts' book helped prevent such a misfortune for me. Do you like to  bicycle? Perhaps in a foreign country? BUT hold back because hills make  older knees ache....because road-traffic is dangerous and dour....because  scenery can vary from the sublime to the prosaic, even trashy?<br />Well,  imagine hundreds of miles of bike paths which is (for some not all) a  pocket of paradise. No hills at all....no motorized traffic at all (and  only one other cyclist every half-hour)....Usually, good  riding-surface....Idyllic scenery--calm waterway on one hand, greenery on  the other, and often an umbrella of shade trees overhead!....Moderate  adventure: you have to navigate your way some, but could never get  &quot;lost&quot;.....Plus, villages for sleeping-and-eating every so often,  which you enter by the waterside &quot;back door,&quot; always at a  pleasant &quot;middle distance&quot;.....This astonishing arena is the  network of tow-paths alongside the canals of France!<br />Formerly used for  commercial traffic, France's hundreds of miles of canals now re-bloom with  slow-moving luxury tourist-barges for costly vacations. But the  still-unknown secret for the bicyclist who wants a trip, tour,  promenade--but with few hassles plus the advantages noted above--is the  tow-paths alongside many (not all) of the canals. They're a private Royal  Road, for an hour, a day, a month.<br />Sure, most visitors to France probably  want to see the sights, from museums to night-life. That's natural. But  this seasoned traveller (me) found the canal-paths THE answer for  recreational relaxing, as noted above.<br />And Tony Roberts' book is the ONLY  one which gives mile-by-mile--oops, kilometer--guidance. His GOOD POINTS:  generic preparation-advice, plus maps-and-text to navigate three canals.  (1) BOURGOGNE, S.E. of Paris. (2) BRETAGNE, in Brittany to the west.

Roberts' book helped prevent such a misfortune for me. Do you like to  bicycle? Perhaps in a foreign country? BUT hold back because hills make  older knees ache....because road-traffic is dangerous and dour....because  scenery can vary from the sublime to the prosaic, even trashy?<br />Well,  imagine hundreds of miles of bike paths which is (for some not all) a  pocket of paradise. No hills at all....no motorized traffic at all (and  only one other cyclist every half-hour)....Usually, good  riding-surface....Idyllic scenery--calm waterway on one hand, greenery on  the other, and often an umbrella of shade trees overhead!....Moderate  adventure: you have to navigate your way some, but could never get  &quot;lost&quot;.....Plus, villages for sleeping-and-eating every so often,  which you enter by the waterside &quot;back door,&quot; always at a  pleasant &quot;middle distance&quot;.....This astonishing arena is the  network of tow-paths alongside the canals of France!<br />Formerly used for  commercial traffic, France's hundreds of miles of canals now re-bloom with  slow-moving luxury tourist-barges for costly vacations. But the  still-unknown secret for the bicyclist who wants a trip, tour,  promenade--but with few hassles plus the advantages noted above--is the  tow-paths alongside many (not all) of the canals. They're a private Royal  Road, for an hour, a day, a month.<br />Sure, most visitors to France probably  want to see the sights, from museums to night-life. That's natural. But  this seasoned traveller (me) found the canal-paths THE answer for  recreational relaxing, as noted above.<br />And Tony Roberts' book is the ONLY  one which gives mile-by-mile--oops, kilometer--guidance. His GOOD POINTS:  generic preparation-advice, plus maps-and-text to navigate three canals.  (1) BOURGOGNE, S.E. of Paris. (2) BRETAGNE, in Brittany to the west. And  (3) MIDI, in the south (from Narbonne to Agen).<br />His BAD POINTS? The text  is not easily-correlated to the maps. And the maps are inconsistent  (sometimes incomplete in features) and also sometimes irritatingly  transposed onto wrong pages out of sequence (baaaaaad editing!). Also, what  about the other canals than these three, why these three only? Roberts  never tells us.<br />PERSONAL DISCLOSURE.

Other reviews here have already noted my two reactions to the book--but implicitly, let me make them explicit. (Then I  have a major concern, fear, confusion which remains about Reaction #2...)  (1) Looking at a vast subject (here, human social evolution and nature) via  a specific thinking-tool (here, game theory) can produce powerful  description, explanation. Bravo. But also, (2) looking at anything requires  a general perspective, which is inevitably value-laden (here, perhaps,  Wright's belief in progress and cooperation--which some reviewers like,  others deeply question). Again bravo, for book and for reviewers.<br />My  concern? I fear for the imminent human social future, specifically the  cataclysmic collision-course we are on regarding environmental rape via  global warming and pollution and resource-depletion, combined with the  rocketing population explosion, plus nation-states' increasing conflicts.  (I don't even include accidental nuclear war, too-probable intentional  terrorism-sabotage via chem-bio-radio...)<br />In short, though good on past  human cooperation, is Wright naively inapplicable, even misleading, on our  dismal approaching nightmare-scenario future? Can Wright confront the  tragedy that though intelligent and somewhat cooperative, Homo Sapiens the  &quot;rogue mammal&quot; lacks both moral sense, plus--the central  point--the ability to cooperate and control selves and society to save  self, society, the planet. Can we ONLY cooperate in a limited  range--family, group, community? We may intelligently see and know the  expresstrain coming at us. Tragically, we can't control that newly-immense  complexity. I DO want to be fair to Wright, but see p. 233 as quoted in  James Simmers 19 Jul 00 review--is Wright perhaps paltry and naive here in  assuming more cooperation than we can muster against approaching  shipwreck?<br />I'm perplexed. Haven't species in the past, hit calamity and  disarray (or even vanished)just-like-that? It's more dismal than  Marx-Freud-existentialism together, perhaps, to think Darwinistically thus.  Perhaps I'm wrong. But the deadly cocktail approaching (population,  environment, warfare) may be utterly new, in order of magnitude? And  utterly inaccessible to Wright's cooperation-in-complexity?  I kind of hope  I'm wrong--that Wright is right here--but for this reader anyhow, NONZERO  powerfully produced ponderings like this....!	2000-08-17

Of the 20 stories, I recall exactly three as truly fulfilling (IMHO) the editors' stated goals of offering fiction which is &quot;finely crafted, forcefully expressed, and sharply imagined.&quot; Two are coming-out  stories, but good ones, because they (1) show the process as slow and  subtle with setbacks also, and also they (2) realistically set personal  liberation in the context of confining family and social networks from  which the person has to escape--a happy ending, but earned, not  romanticized. &quot;Erasing Sonny&quot; shgows a teenager subtly realizing  his own sexual stripe amid the slam-bang chaos of a semi-dysfunctional  family. The motif is a tattoo he gets, and then gets erased, his own skin  and self clear at last. But we readers are right inside his perspiring skin  as he speaks--&quot;sharply imagined&quot; indeed. Then, &quot;Regular  Flattop&quot; is even better. Immersed in the trap of lower-class semi-slum  living, the kid fights his way clear toward his own self with his friend  Tommy. Encouragingly, he gets his impetus toward escape from his own dying  father's admonition to him to fly, get out, to &quot;go somewhere you've  never been before, somewhere beautiful.&quot; Out of the slums, out of  heterosexism. But again we hear it in his great slangy idiom,  &quot;forcefully expressed&quot; indeed.  For dessert, &quot;Quality  Time&quot; is a five-page &quot;wickedly-sinful&quot; confection of a gay  divorced father in his thirties and his reveries concerning his 15-year-old  son Donnie, who is a high-school wrestler indeed. To discuss this  semi-taboo (psychic incest?) with such &quot;fine craft&quot; indeed, is no  mean task. Thus, three gems. I cannot recall the other 17 stories enough to  make any comments on them (which is itself a comment). My &quot;fellow  reader-buddy&quot; also told me he felt this year's volume fell short of  the previous ones. But beware: our ages may be showing, because the comment  of a 19-year-old (in anotherreview here) says the stories present the  &quot;strange quirky demi-monde of gay life today&quot; and gosh, many of  them really do do that. I only wish with more fine craft, forceful  expression, sharp imagination--and intensified emotion. Well, so take a  look for yourself. And, here's to 2001 in this usually-great series.	2000-04-08

Moreover, the author's unique contribution is to complexlyINTERWEAVE homophobia and psychopathology. He holds up twin mirrors, each refracting the other. One mirror hilights all the warps and tangles of this phobia, rarely spotlit in such depth. The other reflects all the major psychiatric disorders (obsession, paranoia, etc.). So the disorders embody the phobia which illuminates the disorders. (Incidentally this twin vision makes the book a fine armchair-textbook in general psychiatry for the amateur reader.) And, SPECIFICS. Kantor not only articulates the concepts, he also supplies concrete examples to show our culture's non-rational hatred-and-fear of homosexuals. His specific anecdotes (the ignoring policeman, the hostile checkout-clerk, the vindictive co-worker, etc.) really bring home how ugly &quot;queer-fear&quot; is by putting human faces on this misbehavior.<br />My single QUALIFICATION is that the book seems to solely discuss psychiatric causes/types of homophobia, and thus it may shortchange probable sociocultural causes of the malady. It doesn't dismiss such, merely overlooks them. True, it briefly discusses religion, etc. But isn't some &quot;homophobia&quot; caused by our being socialized, early and unconsciously, into norms of heterosexism plus aversion to the unspeakable (the queer)? Just as some male chauvinism and white racism are picked up insidiously in the air we breathe? For, other cultures demonstrate much less homophobia (Thailand, parts of Europe); others, much more (Islam, others). So, I suggest that many people are &quot;homophobes&quot; via social conditioning, unlike the 'phobes in Dr. Kantor's book who are so via psychogenic illness. (You are gay, your best friend shuns you, temporarily at least.....Your parents disown or ostracise you.....are these bad responses caused by psychogenic illness, or by counterproductive social learning which can be unlearned, if slowly?) HOWEVER, mycriticism should not disqualify this valuable, indeed essential, book.  I would simply offer today's &quot;integrative&quot; perspective which seeks many causes, many levels (psychological, social, economic, historical, etc.) to many complex problems. And indeed it's still a sickness, even if socially caused--culture can be a &quot;standardization of error,&quot; after all.  But to assume 100% of folks initially averse to gays/lesbians are psychogenically sick, might possibly block needed insights into culturally-learned maladaptions.<br />OTHER BOOKS on homophobia do exist.  Warren Blumenfeld's &quot;Homophobia: How We All Pay The Price&quot; is pragmatic. T. McNaron's &quot;Poisoned Ivy&quot; relates to colleges/universities.  But the whole issue is still under-examined. Why?  Scrutinizing homophobia can help (1) examine gender, (2) help teach how to confront any sensitive social issue better, but especially (3) can be RELEVANT TODAY. As I write this, &quot;the gay thing&quot; is frothing up.  The American military stumbles about with it. The Boy Scouts feel unmanned by it. Gay youth are bashed by it, even with Gay-Straight Alliances in high schools--which in turn disturb some parents. Same-sex marriage is pre-emptively blocked by legislation.  Sure, things will improve; &quot;yesterday's heresy is today's commonplace and tomorrow's orthodoxy.&quot; But to help us all get liberated from this &quot;dragon&quot; fear (=scary, but non-existent in fact), Kantor's book can only help in major ways.

This book's only predecessor was a &quot;landmark&quot; (butlimited) 1988 collection edited by C. Morse and J. Larkin (out of print). Suppose that &quot;reading an anthology&quot; is like &quot;visiting a foreign country.&quot; Well, in its well-meant attempt to raise political awareness, that earlier book seemed to trumpet multicultural diversity, which often drowned out artistic excellence in the tradeoff. As if on an official tour of a totalitarian country, I encountered many blatty propaganda lectures, touring the factories and monuments (poems with messages). But where were &quot;the people,&quot; the individual poets' voices and craft? Thin work seemed included just so all minority-groups were included. A decade later, not so here this time! In THE WORLD IN US, ideology defers to the hundred true flowers of literary artistry for its own sake. In the 221 poems of these 46 currently-writing American poets, I can (to continue the travel analogy) depart from the Intourist route, can visit the &quot;neighborhood cafes&quot; where true &quot;plural voices&quot; speak--not those of ethnic groups, but of fingerprint-unique individual writers. I see the &quot;flower gardens&quot; of imagery, the &quot;craft shops&quot; of polished language. I view the &quot;playgrounds&quot; where poet-athletes sportively play with fixed forms, with the cool-toned mature control which is good style. In short, last decade's liberationist necessities have matured out here to where the only Message, is the poem's vision itself.  You'll surely enjoy. My only regret is that only 46 writers appear. I would have preferred a goal which the editors explicitly rejected, &quot;an overview or a broad sampling of the field.&quot; Instead, they sought &quot;a long, curated poetry reading in book form.&quot; But my personal preference here cannot be a valid criticism of their decision which was bona fide. And anyhow 221 poems is a rich bouquet indeed.....I was glad to see included, co-editor Lassell's poem &quot;How To Watch Your Brother Die.&quot; I taught this perennial blockbuster for semesters in college freshman English 101. Always, its magic turned surly, resistant, and yes, homophobic student-readers into thoughtful, changed appreciators. Now there you do have both political awareness and also poetic artistry pulling in tandem. You also have it in many of the other 220 flowers in this foreign, familiar land.	2000-03-22
US	51224960	R3MS1DYQX3SAN1	0312205147	543338950	The Coming Storm	Books	5	29	34	N	N	Great Gay Novel, &quot;Cross-Over&quot; Literature Too	This novel goes right onto my small &quot;favorite-books&quot; shelf. Here's why.<br />(1) Gay Lit plus Crossover Appeal...Is the novel &quot;way too gay&quot; to appeal to non-gay readers? A same-sex affair plus two  latent men. And homosexuality permeates everywhere here, a subterranean  force--magnetic northstar for some of the characters, toxic waste for other  characters. But like excellent writers, Russell generalizes his material.  Specifically, he takes a topic which is still sensitive, hot-button,  contested, emotional (homosexuality), and makes it speak to general issues  and many readers by deftly employing its grist (namely, conflict between  self and society; tradition vs. change; degrees of self-knowledge;  duplicity and appearance-vs.-reality). These universal issues are dealt  with by all the novel's characters, the heterosexuals too. This dimension  elevates the novel out a ghettoized gay-lib piece.<br />Oh, the novel is  gay-friendly in portraying &quot;our world too.&quot; But usually more  subtle than slick. Example: how does Russell portray gay people  &quot;coming out&quot; in the novel? Not in the quick-step speed-up of some  Coming Out novels. Rather, like in the reality world--namely slowly; with  clues and hints, some seen, some missed, some denied; with new insights  into earlier events; with backstepping reversals. Complex and true--like  life. Ditto for Russell's involuntarily-rich portrayal of internalized  homophobia, and people resisting, resisting the beast within. (Early the  novel is imbued with such Thomas-Mann type repression. Is the very end of  the book melodramatic and politicalized--or a continuation of history and  change? You will decide.)<br />(2) Aesthetic Artistry too. Russell can  construct a solid novel. Structure? Skilled writers depict chaos within the  frame of order, form, structure. (Or, they used to...) Here, the central  &quot;storm&quot; analogy is unifying but not overdone, and the lesser  echoes foreshadow and reminisce nicely. Narration? Russell excels at  oblique narration carrying a character's thoughts which s/he believes are  true, but which we the reader can easily question--the &quot;unreliable  narrator.&quot; Story-line? Russell installs sheer page-turning conflict,  action, suspense--even the &quot;progression of effect&quot; whereby near  the end, the sub-plots speed up and intertwine madly.<br />P.S. on pederasty.  Some readers may raise eyebrows at the &quot;under-age&quot; sexuality.  Others may sense a quiet tract in favor of consenting adult-youth (not  pre-pubertal) relations. &quot;Whatever...&quot;<br />THE COMING STORM reminds  me of (in gay novels) Mark Merlis' craftily-wrought AMERICAN STUDIES, but  with more scope-and-depth. If your tastes accord with mine as described  above, put this novel on your nightstand. It may go farther onto the  &quot;keepers&quot; shelf.....	2000-01-30

P. Kinsella, efficiently  frightens in its portraying the blood-pressure-intense damage when a macho  type suppresses his gay side--for a while.....&quot;The Cold Wind And The  Warm,&quot; by Ray Bradbury, is a lyric watercolor of a very-gay contingent  wafting into a staid Irish hotel--but everyone survives just fine....My two  favorites include &quot;May We Borrow Your Husband?&quot; by Graham Greene.  Never was &quot;gay seduction&quot; more crisply portrayed, though the  seductee (a young British bridegroom) survives just fine also.....Finally,  &quot;Torridge,&quot; by William Trevor, re-creates in front of us the  chilling, calculated revenge of a harrassed British schoolboy triumphing  years later. At a dinner, the formerly-triumphant straight (or at least  married) school &quot;chums&quot; and their families, collapse gently and  stately like falling dominoes under Torridge's triumph--a scene to behold  indeed.<br />Nowadays, yearly series of gay male short stories emerge--good  ones, too. But IN ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST carved out an indispensable  &quot;woodcut&quot; in this genre; seek it out.	2000-01-30

Only 2-3 of 18 reviews so far score DINING OUT down for the very unclear elucidation which I, also, find truly mars it. That obscurity is indeed a  shame, because the book does contain fine key concepts about responding to  food, plus alternative stands on each of the concepts. Trouble is, the  writers didn't finish &quot;cooking&quot; the book. They formatted it via  interview-after-interview. They never distilled out the valuable content  into a reduced sauce, so to speak. The book is not as clear as l6 reviewers  implied, but it is more valuable than 2 reviewers suggested. If you can  sift and strain out the nuggets. Which I did, taking a full hour to do so.  MY SUGGESTION: buy the book and savor its marinated morsels of wisdom of  responding to food. But see if my own &quot;clarifying of its stew,&quot;  below, can help guide you in and through it. Here then are the KEY ISSUES I  wish the authors had forefronted more, the better to access their good  material on the book's key issue, &quot;How to rank or rate a dish?&quot;:  (1) Chef and reviewer should know the classic basic recipe. Then they can  alter it knowingly. Of course, some innovations work, others don't. (2)  Surely a basic criterion for all food is &quot;balance&quot; of tastes,  instead of flavors either muddied or fighting. (Whether one flavor  dominates, or several blend.) A corollary is &quot;bad food is obvious,  good food is trickier to know.&quot; (3) Reviewers have personal  taste-preferences, but the better critics know these, identify them for the  reader, and don't let them bias their fair judgments. (4) Still, reviewers'  criteria vary--some are rigorous and demanding, others more  &quot;relaxed,&quot; even lax or lenient. (5) Another criterion is the  chef's own goals.  S/he may like elegant-gourmet, or just &quot;big sloppy  relaxed flavors.&quot; Good reviewers are fair here. (6) The  &quot;star&quot; rating-system may exclude some good types of food; a  superb hot-dog stand may warrant five stars in its class, but it isn't in  the system. (7) Yet another variable: different national-cultural cuisines  hold different standards and methods (for cooking fish, for instance), and  the reviewer should know them and evaluate by their own goals. .....and  there you have my distillation of the rich &quot;soup-bone stock&quot; of  DINING OUT. Of course, I had to omit the juicy examples, which enrich the  book. I hope this pre-vue helps your experience of &quot;tasting&quot; this  multi-course book which, although conceptually-unfinished, nevertheless can  satisfy our hungry interest in how to respond to food. Good reading.	2000-01-12

We're past such agonizing?  But aha, major personal growth against the norms is always turbulent.  Anyhow, I have loved this novel for 3 reasons: its Paris, its prose, and  its psychology. PARIS: Baldwin vividly sketches in words that great city.  Onion soup at 4 A.M. in dubious cafes....the indomitable concierge....the  sweeping quarters....and the rest. PROSE: Baldwin's long sentences,  preaching-inspired, roll and swell and flow on and redouble. And,  PSYCHOLOGY: sure, the bleakness of David is &quot;pre-gay-lib,&quot; let  alone pre-gay marriage plus parenting! But homophobia is not yet slain, is  it. Plus, more universal is David's struggling with the major human issue  of (as Baldwin said in ANOTHER COUNTRY) &quot;the life you have, you want,  you think you want, you should want, and you think you should want.&quot;  Today, more of us can sooner arrive at where David only started, in his  first surrender to Giovanni and male love: &quot;With everything in me  shouting No, yet the sum of me sighed Yes.&quot; Baldwin's unique portrayal  of human emotions as risky, vulnerable, dubious--a great gift of  his--energizes this novel for me; always has.	2000-01-10

It's one day in the life of George, a state-college professor in California, a gay transplanted Britisher and a gay widower in his  fifties. But the novel glows with staginess, with theatrical  perspective--how we act toward others, notice how others perceive us.  (Shakespeare said all life is a stage, we players play our parts,  etc....The modern sociologist Erwin Goffman more craftily saw human  interaction dramatically, how we do &quot;impression management,&quot; how  we slyly &quot;observe the unobserved observer&quot; and the like....And  semiotics studies signs, whether conventional--red light means danger--or  deviant--subtle dress-cues). A SINGLE MAN exemplifies this life-as-theater;  George notices, wonders, etc. This is good for its specific gay material  (double life; stereotypes; coming out halfway or not; &quot;do they know  about me?&quot; and the like. It's also good general human material. Now,  this praise of the novel as theatrical revelations, is my own personal  response, my insight? bias? both? ever since I read A SINGLE MAN 20 years  ago. But beyond this, the novel is a ripping good tale. The breeders next  door....love and loss....ageing plus gym-resilience and energy....our  plastic education systems....Charlotte the female confidante.... bewitching  young students, including Kenny.... and more. Surely one of the best dozen  gay novels--as a novel.	2000-01-10

And interblended with the written text,  too. Rare is this twin-starring of word and image, plus this  permutation-and-combination of images. Only in comics do word and image so  vitally interact.

This  disconnectedness seems to picture classic &quot;attachment  disorder&quot;--does the author either intend or realize this? A strength  of the book is that we can decide this ourselves. As also about the  ending--contrived, or realistic? It's subtly-enough done for &quot;each  reader to decide.&quot; If you like superb depictions of strip-mall  shoddiness, plus insular-isolated male-male interrelations (albeit ignited  with sex), visit this fictional corner of the real world.	1999-12-11

Today I read the 50 or so reviews here. Readers like his energetic hopeful-idealistic attempt toward better knowledge. They dislike his monism, one-sidedness, his I would say  emotional, very &quot;human,&quot; attraction toward his--pet theory? Well,  preferred position, of the biogenetic as the centrality of things--all  things. I see in the book these two things: the good (useful) desire to add  useful but still-overlooked information (about biogenetics) to help  understand humanity in general, and the bad emotional sway, trend, feel to  gaze upon the biogenetic as the center. I am less troubled by this monistic  drift toward his pet place (we all are ideo-centric; I myself am a  compulsive? holist-integrationist-synthesizer, so there), than I am by the  fact that we do need proof, or examples. The main parts of the fine arts  will not be illuminated, per se and as such, by biogenetics. See--within  the field of &quot;integrative studies&quot; in academe today, I find many  calls for true integration, but few examples that that very difficult thing  can be achieved.  IN SUM: did Wilson create a good attempt, but flawed a  bit by (1) biogenetic monism/centrism, (2) wishful thinking as to just how  much integration really can be achieved? And that's my own take on it.	1999-07-07
US	51224960	RD13OEV9YK3PF	0964664259	624403805	Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far	Books	1	7	30	N	N	An Opportunity Perhaps Missed	(1) Regretfully I have to caution that many of the statements in the latter half of the book are factually inaccurate or improbable. The fears of seduction, contagion, slippery-slope maladjustments occurring by  homosexuality freely-existing--I do not blat here they are wrong (let alone  &quot;bigoted&quot;--improper word), simply deeply questionable. (2) I  suggest that these statements do not reflect &quot;science&quot; so much as  an implicit world-view, or guiding ideology, of &quot;natural law,&quot;  precisely that &quot;human nature exists, specifically heterosexual  normality among other laws, and to deviate from same will cause personal  disorganization and even social danger.&quot; Fine as an ideology if you  wish, and to be discussed; but please make explicit your own propelling  ideologies! (3) The reason all this is regrettable--the infusing of the  book with unstated Natural Law absolutistic morality--is simply that the  whole issue of &quot;psychopathology and homosexuality&quot; IS a trenchant  topic which should be discussed more, and more objectively, than seems  possible in today's climate of (needed) gay/lesbian liberation and also of  (well-intended, but...) Political Correctness. So I wish Socarides had been  able to do so. As it is, read into the book for an example of application  of tacit, covert, implicit, unstated Natural-Law philosophy or morality. A  truly-balanced view of the subject (avoiding the liberationsts' cheerful  refusals to look beyond minority-oppression for causes of problems chez gay  males anyhow) remains to be written?.....	1999-07-07
