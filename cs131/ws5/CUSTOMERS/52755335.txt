You won't reget buying! I first saw it in Istanbul airport and tried to convince my husband to pay the fifty dollars they were asking. Glad I waited to grab it here it was a lot less, but it would still have been worth the money!	2005-06-21

Having grown up with postmortem photography in my family albums, and raised by two Victorian German-Polish Americans, this subject did not seem taboo to me. Both Stanley Burns and Jay Ruby(Secure the Shadow) recognize that these photos are shocking to some, however once over any shock you might feel, the images tell so much more than that of living images..just like any archeological,anthroplogical study..we always learn more from the dead than the living. If you already collect postmortem items, this book will save a lot of money as he has collected the images for you! I only wish the first Sleeping Beauty would go to reprint, heck you have to take out a bank loan to get one! Another good one I mentioned earlier is Jay Ruby's \\"Secure the Shadow\\". I am currently buying Michael Lesy's \\"Wiconsin Death Trip\\" and would need another bank loan to grab James Van Der Zee's \\"Harlem Book Of the Dead\\"..If anyone has a copy of Sleeping Beauty, the first one..and just doesn't want it around the house 'cause it is morbid and they want to sell it fast and ..well..cheaper..LET ME KNOW!!!

To conspiracy buffs and lone nut believers alike...this has got to be one of the most non commital and non emotional book about that day in Dallas ever written. Note to conspiracy buffs...almost all the stories sound TOO similar...like they have had ALOT of time to concur...to the lone nut Oswald did it folks..it will stike you odd about the dispassionate way all of the people tell their stories, I mean I realize the bulk majority were police and FBI, but it is just so dry, even if Oswald could be proven to be the lone nut, surely it shouldn't make the assassination less emotional. Literally it goes\\" well I went down the steps and looked at the top of my shoe..blah!Blah!\\" It is an okay book to have if you have a good collection already, and just want it to put with the rest.	2004-08-12

Aw, the poor blameless Greeks...victims after all, give me a break! These two countries have been either fighting or kissing for centuries! It seems to me the Western world is just falling into the same old trap of &quot;if their Chirstian, they must be okay&quot; syndrome. We all forget how powerful the Greek empire was, and why is it from the hundreds of Greeks and Turks I know drop the hatred of each other as soon as they step onto american soil? COMMON GROUND...set Cyprus and it's people both Greek and Turk free...they'll do fine without their mother countries and all of us and our uninformed opinions....why is it anytime Turks are part of the subject of a book, even a cookbook, they are told how evil they are by the reviewers? This review should be about the book, not how much an reader hates other people...creepy...	2004-04-21

This book is so spectacular you can feel the steam and hear the sound of silver water dishes against the basins. The baths are a treasure, and this book is one of the most impressive works of preservation for our memories, and dreams of being able to visit the baths before it is too late. The baths represent an entire era..a way of life that unless preserved, can never be recaptured. Don't let the cost of this book put you off! When you first get it, you'll be shocked that it is not very big in size, but as soon as you open the covers...the content is as rich and aromatic as the ambergris and bergamot once used in the elaborate ritual of the Bath.	2004-03-03

Ironically I went to Turkiye about the same time jeremy was publishing this book, and ironically I went in search of a real fez.....among other things,as well as to meet the in laws...this book is so too true! I looked for the fez, and got very similar responses! This book is best read by someone who's been there, or has at least more than a passing interest in Turkiye.

This was a good read, but a heavy one laced with nordic history and is best read by someone with at least rudimentary knowledge of the occult, and German history. It can get tedious. Some of the things said in this book have a definite truth to them and some things were just hypothesis, but it is a good place to start for occult research of The Spear of Destiny, and some of the cults that have formed around the theories mentioned here.	2003-10-20

I am a former Death care worker, and I bought this hoping to hear some of the same tales we all told. Well, all of us in death care know there are creeps out there that mistreat corpses, but to write about all of it in the open market where kids could read it is too much. Some of the people in this book that Katherine wrote about should have been prosecuted. Necrophilia of the most physical kind...not the witchy talking to the dead....is a most mature subject matter,objectionable even. The people that participate in corpse abuse, mutilation or sexual acts, are mentally ill or evil or both. If you buy this book, and it has some interesting tales and some fact, don't leave it around for young people. Thanks, Dawn.	2003-07-15

Spent time last year in a couple  of rural Turkish homes that still had some facets of this instituion. It  was so different than the uninformed would believe. This book was a  refreshing look at the history of one of the most interesting subjects in  the world. A Special intention for the victims of the earthquake, May Allah  bless you and and keep you in His loving arms during this saddest of  times.May your strength carry you through as it has so many times.All my  love to the people of Turkey.
