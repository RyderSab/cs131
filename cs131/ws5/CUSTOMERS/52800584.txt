Let's face it, the tools provided here are poorer than poor, the same scissors, glue, and needles you'd find at any 99C store. As for the instruction book, you'd be much better off buying a real volume on book repair from either Amazon or one of those library supplies store (such as Gaylord). That leaves only the bulky box itself. I suppose it does look better than a shoebox on the bookshelf. But you'd be a fool to pay so much just for that. In short, for the same amount of money, why not buy yourself a nice new book instead?	2003-12-07

Ambrose Bierce he is not. Nor much of an incisive critic in the Frankfurt School vein either, though no doubt he wishes he had Adorno's acerbic wit. What the book ends up being, then, is a collection of half-baked observations written in workaday prose. The entries either are utterly pointless (&quot;HAPPY HOUR: A depressing comment on the rest of the day and a victory for the most limited Dionysian view of human nature.&quot;) or take potshots at ideas and people far too complicated for Saul's facile understanding of the universe (the entry on Plato begins: &quot;Brilliant novelist. Accomplished humourist. In spite of which he wasn't as much the author of Socrates as he would have wished&quot;--okay, but who WOULD be, I wonder, since Socrates wrote no books himself? Would Saul argue that it'd be better to have no books at all purporting to summarize Socrates' thoughts than those by Plato?).

Imagine my disappointment, then, on finding on my table a half-baked novel whose characters are flatter than yesterday's Coke and whose story line is about as engaging as the dog-eared menu in a zero-star diner. Indeed, I probably care more about this imaginary menu, grease- and ketchup-stained it might be, than the fate of any of the characters in the novel. <br />Frankly, I don't understand why a U.S. publisher, and a literary one at that, would bother with this kind of lowly trash: the writing can't even be called workaday--it's simply beneath contempt. Any talented tenth-grader could've written better. For that matter, I can't quite understand why a highly regarded Brazilian publisher (Companhia Das Letras) would publish such an abomination either. It's possible that something has been lost in translation, but I rather doubt this, since Garcia-Roza, to judge by this book at least, has come up with a prose style that would make the dumbest subject-verb-object writing look Proustian by comparison. Instead of Raymond Chandler, a more appropriate point of reference might be Raymond Carver at his absolute worst--the sort of thing he, Carver, would no doubt have thrown into the wastebasket without a single pang of remorse. The book is without art, without wit, without life, without any redeeming quality I can think of (even the cover art is mediocre).	2002-11-21

No wonder this is such a huge seller in Britain right now. Although I've not seen the television series on which  the book is based (or is it the other way around?), I do want to reassure  my fellow readers at Amazon that if they've liked any of de Botton's  previous books (especially HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE), they won't be  disappointed at all with this new work, which comes with those amusing  illustrations that are a trade mark of a de Botton book. While I suppose  it's possible to cavil at the book's &quot;popularization&quot; of  philosophy, the short answer to such complaints is simply to ask those  cranky readers to stick to the millions of dusty old academic monographs at  their local university libraries and stay away from someone as fun and  playful as de Botton. If philosophy has always been THIS fun, I tell you,  there would never have been any need for the Cultural Wars and books like  THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND.	2000-04-29

I've heard much talk of the author before--especially her seminal book  &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;--but &quot;Nature  of Economies&quot; is the first book by Jacobs I've ever read. I'm glad to  report that all the positive things I've heard about the author is true:  she is as sharp and thoughtful a thinker as they come. What's even more  endearing (for me anyway) is that she eschews the jargons and pompous prose  of academy and writes with simplicity and grace so that anyone and everyone  can understand her points. (I can't remember the last time that I've read a  book on economics or sociology and not been put off by the awful  language.)<br />Another special thing about this book, as most of you've  probably heard by now, is that Jacobs has cast her thoughts in the dialogue  form: conversations between 5 intimate friends. I must say it's quite  strange to come upon a serious treatise on economics and nature, written  and published in the first year of the 21st century, that uses what seems  (to me) an 18th- or 19th-century format (I'm thinking in particular of  those philosophical dialogues on religion, morality, etc., written by the  likes of David Hume and Giacomo Leopardi, not to mention all those  &quot;philosophes&quot; of the Enlightenment), which was in turn an  imatation of the Platonic dialogues. Well, why not? After all, Jacobs has  the brilliance of mind and sharpness of wit to get away with it. (Though it  does mean getting some used to for an average reader like me.)<br />As for  what the book is trying to say, I'm still trying to figure it out. It's  such a tiny little book but yet I'm not embarrassed to say that I've not  fully grasped all her points. But I do know that this book has all the  trappings of a classic (in the best sense of the word) and it'll be read  and reread, debated over and written about, again and again, in the years  to come. <br />So is Jacobs the new Hume or Leopardi? Maybe. The last  &quot;philosophe&quot; of our modern era? Definitely.	2000-03-19

While the original article, which first appeared in the New Yorker quite a while back, was absorbing, delightful,  and even thought-provoking, but I suppose my initial positive reaction was  mostly due to the fact that it was a MAGAZINE ARTICLE, and I read it--as  most people read magazine articles--while eating a meal alone or commuting  to work; that is to say, without sitting at my desk, pencil and notepad at  hand, paying each word and every sentence my undivided attention. I don't  of course wish to disparage journalism or books written by journalists, but  &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; suffers, I think, from everything that can go  wrong when one adopts, expands, or simply reprints a newspaper or magazine  article into a full-length book. The arguments Gladwell presents, when  they're surrounded not by cute and funny New Yorkers cartoons but between  the cardboards of a hardcover book, seem lightweight at best, and  commonsensical, perhaps even farfetched, at worst. A fellow reviewer below  has already noted the strange absence of any discussion of memes. Allow me  to add that in a book that purports to reveal the little hidden mechanics  that bring about tidal-wave changes in our social behavior and our society,  the absence of detailed examination of memetics is simply unforgivable.  (It'd be like writing a book that claims to talk about 20th-century physics  but skips any mention of quantum mechanics.) In addition, some of the  &quot;scientific&quot; methods employed by Gladwell seems dubious when  they're not simply quixotic. For instance, the little experiment whereby  Gladwell gave a list of people's last names to &quot;400&quot; people to  read, asking them to give themselves a point every time they personally  &quot;know&quot; someone who shares any of the last names on that list,  seems just so pointless as not to merit inclusion even in a shoddilywritten article, much less a real book. And what's Gladwell's conclusion  from this little experiment? That college students don't score too well,  because they don't yet have the opportunity to know too many people, while  real professionals, especially those whose business it is to have a lot of  business connections, score the best. (You don't say!) And then Gladwell  went on, apparently oblivious of the obviousness of it all, to dub the  latter, the well connected, &quot;the Connectors&quot; (his capitalization;  I should also mention that the author, like many fellow journalists, has  the annoying habit of coining catchphrases, the usefulness of most of which  seems rather questionable). If you think this is ridiculous, please allow  me to assure you that the book is full of examples like this. All I can say  is that if you're intrigued by the idea of the &quot;tipping point,&quot;  perhaps you should just go to your local library and photocopy those few  pages of the New Yorker, rather than spend your money on the actual book.  It's just not worth it.	2000-02-20

I  mean, which would you prefer--yet another dryly academic treatise on Jesus  that summarized all the facts in 800 pages and showed little or no emotion  (so that you don't even know if the author is religious or not), or  something much more colorful, but that does away with the tight and  uncomfortable trappings of scholarly tomes? If you prefer the former, I can  only recommend that you learn German, since you can then devote the rest of  your life wading through such awfully boring (please pardon my choice of  word) stuff as, say, the maddeningly trivial dating of a certain event  related in the Bible. But if you choose the latter, then I can say that I  don't quite know too many books like Cahill's: concise, engrossing,  interesting, and, yes, always fun. If the book does nothing else but  engages the reader's interest, then I think it has achieved a noble  purpose. Whether you agree with Cahill's opinions or not is of course  something else entirely. But then, do you always have to agree with an  author's opinion to enjoy his or her book or to benefit from reading it?	1999-11-29

The produciton is poor (the cover alone, a hardcover art book without a dustjacket and printed on the board itself--how cheap can you get!), the colors are off, the drawings--or what  passes for such--are boring, the artist's imagination is nowhere evident,  and the whole book is one huge and endless monotony. Boy, am I glad that I  didn't have to live my year as it's depicted in this worthless book!	1999-11-29

Whether you're a believer or (like me) a nonbeliever, I simply fail to see why Aczel must drag God into it at all. I don't like the writing and I don't think the story is as much of a  &quot;thriller&quot; as some of the advance reviews may lead us to believe.  Finally, I found it very annoying that Aczel is now billed--at least by his  publisher--as an internationally renowned mathematician. Well, he's not.  Never was, and never will be. All that he's done is having written a  previous bestseller on Fermat, which cashes in on the current craze for  bite-sized and chewy scientific knowledge. While that's not necessarily a  mean achievement, it doesn't make him a top math guy. So please spare us  the hyperbole.	1999-11-16

The book is at once a philosophical  meditation on the concept of zero, an engaging tour guide through the  labyrinth of mathematics, an intimate (if highly abbreviated) biography of  some of the foremost geniuses of our world, and a zestful and highly  anecdotal history of the evolution of one branch of science. What's more,  the writing is both sharp and lively (which is more than I can say about  most popular-science titles). All in all, I'm very much impressed by this  book.	1999-10-20

It is written with both persuasiveness and clarity. It also manages to filter through and summarize  a great number of different shools of thought on management. All in all, I  find it impressive. One of the best books I've read of its kind for quite  sometime. I've never heard of the author before, but I sure am glad to have  read him now.	1999-08-27

Ever wonder why we're all of us in such a huge hurry, day in and day out? If you have, this book is for you. But if you haven't, you're, I'm afraid,  even more in need  of reading this. Wide ranging and erudite, Gleick's new book takes us  through every facet of our lives. Sex, baseball, movies, watches,  computers--you name it. (My only regret is that the book doesn't talk about  the acceleration of popular music--look at what Punk and Hardcore did to  Elvis and the Beatles!) Kudos, Mr. Gleick.

What precisely, I ask you, is  little Freddy Raphael's motive--by first publishing his oh-so-perceptive  accounts of his few hours of &quot;intimacy&quot; with Kubrick in all the  papers and magazines in both the U.K. and the U.S., and then this, THE  book--but to couple his own tired name to that of a genius? I have  personally always found Raphael smugly self-satisfied--apparently he thinks  himself a polymathic genius (you only have to read a few lines in his  regular reviews for the TLS to know that Narcissus ain't got nothing on  him), but he is of course entitled to his own vanity. And more power to  him. But this book is something else entirely: it's a vile rip-off of  another person's hard-fought achievement and even harder-fought privacy.  Words like opportunism and intellectual fraud are too mild for this kind of  para-tabloid treatment. What's next? A memoir of Wittgenstein because the  author used to sit in the same chair at Cambridge as once did the touchy  Austrian?	1999-08-02

The prose is lousy, sometimes resembling the breathless (and brainless) outpourings of those photo-romances so popular in postwar Italy, and the  illustrations are of very low quality, almost as if done on a cheap  photocopier. Callas would have hated this book.	1999-06-19
US	52800584	R2JRZRDNK61ATD	0375402721	877422050	Original Bliss	Books	1	4	13	N	N	Bah!	When Mrs. Brindle and Professor Gluck were finally consummating their relationship at the book's end, torrential tears of joy began to rush down my cheeks. Not, I mind you, because I was moved by the corny denouement,  but because the stupid thing was finally over! DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! THIS  HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS (EVEN BY THE LOW STANDARDS OF  &quot;POPULAR FICTION&quot;) ON THE MARKET TODAY! Ms. Kennedy simply  doesn't know how to plot or create believable characters; nor is she any  good at dialogues---in fact, the dialogues here must rate as some of the  blandest one has ever encountered, almost as pointless as any snippet one  is likely to overhear in any airport or supermarket. I don't know what  someone as intelligent as Thomas Lynch saw in this junk of a novella, but  it certainly has got me worried that perhaps Mr. Lynch's daytime job has  been wearying him down, so that he could no longer differentiate between  the living and the dead---whether in life or in art. The only positive  thing one could say about this American edition is that it's much better  produced (the paper, the binding) and infinitely better copyedited (less  misspellings, incorrect punctuation, etc.) than the British edition, and  that it's much shorter, too, doing away with the ten bogus short stories  that accompanied the Jonathan Cape edition.	1999-02-16

It's not really all THAT difficult to come up with an original theory,  however strained, that &quot;explains&quot; something (or, for that matter,  everything)--whether the &quot;original thinking&quot; in question be as  widely accepted as that of Darwin, as fiercely argued over as those of Marx  and Freud, as discredited as the tenets of Theosophy and Alchemy, as  questionable as the paradigm shift of Kuhn, or as downright obvious as the  birth-order theory of Sulloway.<br />But it's much, much harder, I should  think, to resist this impulse, not to mention the intellectual hubris, for  showy originality, and be content to seek, instead, to study and understand  things and the world around us (pace Kant) as they really are. To me,  Daniel J. Boorstin epitomizes the latter--the tireless scholar who plods  through countless tomes (many of them as forgotten today as the very  &quot;original&quot; monadology of Leibniz) to present to us, in prose that  is always clear and elegant, the distillation of a life time's learning  (and what a life time's learning). If there is no radically new  interpretations (or &quot;original&quot; thoughts) to be found in  Boorstin's great trilogy, consider how much more educated the average  reader, as well as specialists of all fields, will become simply by dipping  into THE DISCOVERERS, THE CREATORS, and THE SEEKERS.<br />All this is another  way of saying that I endorse this book heartily. Let those others--the  aspiring disco critics who think themselves too hip to be seen in the  library--chase after the latest original thinkers: the would-be  system-builders and the hopeful Grand Theorists.                                               --- Jonathan Lee	1998-10-01

Some people come into the world with the enviable ability to philosophize; others are blessed with a no less enviable gift to think through an idea logically and clearly. Which puts G. W. S. Trow in an awkward position: for though he could not write well, he yet fancies himself a great stylist; and though his critical thinking is at best muddle-headed and derivative, he yet imagines himself an oracular critic of the sharpest distinction. Reading this re-publication of Trow's throw-away essay instantly brought to mind that immortal phrase Dwight Macdonald used to lampoon Jimmy Gould Cozzens's prose style: malphony exfoliates.	1998-02-24
