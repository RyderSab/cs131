Thank God I had it. It made my movement in Cape Town enjoyable and easy.

Excellent guide with wonderful endearing side bars on locals-it gives you a great sense of Cape Town and its local flavour. All the sections are dead on. I found the dining and shopping extremely helpful with its guide to what is uniquely Capetonian. This is by far the best guide to Cape Town out now. The writers and contributors for this guide should be commended.	2005-04-30

I did not read this translation but it concerns me that the title would be mistranslated important as it is because spirit and consciousness are two different things. I am sure the westerner who translated would argue the opposite. This books is possibly one of the best books I have ever read. It is Al-Hakim's best story. If you like this book you will also enjoy \\"Maze of Justice\\" and \\"Tree Climber\\" and \\"The Fate of a Cockroach\\".	2005-02-28

I am not violently opposed to this book neither is the writing that excessively bad...the book is a definition of the utter waste of time.	2005-02-07

This book really didn't do anything for me. Its like one of those books you read and then they become part of those untitled stream of books you've read but vaguely remember-kind of like going to a movie that you can barely recall seeing from 2-3 years ago. <br /> <br />Its not badly written but if it had not been assigned reading for class, i would have preferred to read something else. If yu want to read good South African literature, try Gordimer, or Coetzee. Both of whom won the Nobel Prize in literature in recent years. There is no reason why you should or should not read it. It may resonate for those who are south african more. <br /> <br />The characterization is particularly strong so that the characters seem indelible. There is a subtlety to the meaning of the story and the analogy or metaphor it paints of all south africa- young white idealism, blacks who can't forget apartheid, old cynical views, etc. i think this may be the sort of book that touches people differently. SO while i may read it and feel unaffected, it may do something quite different to another. <br />	2004-12-16

It has some interesting twists and poses very serious questions and ideas in our modern world. The novel is brilliant in some sense in its attacking of subject matter. At the same time, the very very last few pages of the book dismantled quite rapidly (like a bomb) the story the author had been building in a very unsatisfying way.  its like building a very intricate house of cards and then taking an industrial fan to face it and blow them all away. <br /> <br />What is so relevant and important in this novel is the identity of humans and society in a modern age. So much of what is written now is garbage and has no meaning which is why this is so poignant- it has meaning. it is a contradiciton. it is sensitive while being insensitive. the deceptive clearness of the narrator leads to a muddled story. The absurdity of the premise is poetic. and it almost works when the entire house of cards the story is built on topples. almost. Regardless of how many stars it gets, this book is well worth the read if you want to read very recent work.	2004-12-16

I feel like i wasted my money on this book! Its better to stick to translation by Louise Varese or at least stay away from this translation. the language made akward and because i know french and the french version on the opposite page-i can see his translated badly in some parts- sometimes at random-he translates word for word which makes the poem's reading too hard to bear! then other times he takes artistic license! This translator should be locked up for crime against poetry for destroying Baudelaire's work. All I can say to the translator is Shame on YOU!  Please do not buy this book- i beg you- or you will not be able to enjoy Baudelaire because he is one of the greatest poets.	2004-09-22

The way it was written made you feel as if you were right there in the pocket of the main character, David.  After the intial disgust with him, you begin to love and respect him especially since he proves himself to be human and real. <br /> <br />But the story has a note of futility. of the situation. and that is the real sadness- that people push on and struggle even though it seems like things are just getting worse.  More importantly i think it changed my attitude about the violence in S.A. So often do we only think of the violence inflected upon the black Africans but there was violence against the white Africans also and that is just as much wrong and i never felt that way before.  <br /> <br />In a way this story has helped me see the situation in Palestine/Israel in a new light. How Israelis must feel living in danger and have violence being threatened against them even though their regime is doing something fundamentally wrong.  Who do we hold repsonsible for the actions of history and a governmental body?  And how should they be punished?  This is a serious question in a world where the alst remanants of colonialism is disintegrating. <br /> <br />But the book left me sad and confused and maybe that was the point. I felt if I had been stranded in the African wilderness. and sometimes i could not udnerstand why the daughter of David had the attitude she had and did the things she did after the violent incident.  Why did both David and his daughter react so differently?  Was it merely a generational gap?  The father is part of the old thinking and the daughter is riddled with guilt of what the odler generation did that she will lay down as a sacrifice for people to take their vengeance?	2004-09-07

I find myself wanting to find out how it ends as opposed to enjoying the moment.  A story from Arabian Nights cries out for the jewelled words, dancing elephants, and bursting bombastic speeches.  It is nonetheless a valiant effort by someone not from that region and maybe his rendition is perfect for the western reader who perfers sparse words, less speeches, less ceremony, and more story and intrigue.  Dont get me wrong its an enjoyable read for its simple language for the subway, beach, plane, or a dentist's waiting room. I was disappointed because i expected so much more.	2003-04-23
