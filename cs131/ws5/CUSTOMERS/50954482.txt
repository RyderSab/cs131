In my opinion this book looks at this topic from an American perspective and what America needs to do to remain competitive globally as well as to recognize Asia as an opportunity for partnering for growth. <br /> <br />Firstly the book lists the historical outline of global economics in a very clear and crisp summary under each chapter. I was amazed by the clarity and depth of the author's understanding of India's transformational journey from a controlled economy into a vibrant market economy in the 90's.  \\"Made in China\\" and \\"Serviced in  India\\" are two chapters that one should not miss in this book. <br /> <br />Secondly the description of the economies on either sides of the Atlantic - America to spend and consume while Western Europe to save and produce - is amazing. The author claims that Europeans were taxed on their consumption while Americans were taxed on their income with incentives for consumption is what has caused the world's biggest economy to end up as the world's biggest debtor. <br /> <br />With Asia, China and India in particular emerging as global economies very fast, the EU, NAFTA and perhaps an Asian Union with an Asian currency appears to become a reality soon. <br /> <br />The book also focuses on the weakening dollar and the global impact of rising oil prices. America is advised to tighten its belt, reduce consumption and conserve energy while from a strategic level should quickly put in place a plan for global competitiveness. <br /> <br />The author strongly defends manufacturing as a core economic activity and America's neglect of this sector is a main reason for losing its competitive edge in research and technical education. <br /> <br />Oil has risen from 30's to 60's since this book was in print. If the author should publish a revised edition of the book , he would further reinforce his views and forecasts of the first edition. <br /> <br />The bottom line is clear. Three billion new capitalists from the east have begun their economic march. Do not ignore them or fight them, but join them to make this planet a better place for all mankind in the twenty-first century.	2005-10-06

Business environment undergoes dramatic changes driven by macro economic and political factors and hence it is important to redefine the strategic maps continuously. The author has listed the five most important factors - Globalization, Demographics, Consumption patterns, Natural Resources and Environment, Regulation and Activism that play a significant role in shaping business success. One chapter is devoted to each of these factors. Frankly, I did not find anything original in any of these. However each chapter is a very good summary on the topic which otherwise need a separate book for each. MBA students will be glad to hear this. <br /> <br />Different scenarios are discussed under each chapter and the impact of these on business is discussed. Honestly, this treatment is grossly inadequate. A good overview emerges at the end but again it lacks depth. <br /> <br />The book is not industry specific and to that extent is balanced. I recommend further detailing in another book by the author so that we can put concepts into practice. As pointed out rightly in the book, this is the `why' of the topic. We need also to understand the `how' of implementation.	2005-09-08

The world so far was dominated by L-centred professionals or those whose who predominantly excel in using the left side of the  brain. The admission tests to get into the best of today's professional courses test our analytical, arithmetic and verbal skills. The good news is that we have done well so far. But the bad news is that in the industrial age followed by the information we have utilised only one half of our brain, that is the \\"left\\".  Welcome to the conceptual age which demands our \\"right\\" and rightfully so. <br /> <br />The author first explains the functioning of the human brain , its left and right sides and what they stand for, in a very simple and non jargon approach. His personal understanding of the functioning of the brain using the fMRI scan technology may appear over simplistic to a well trained medical professional or psychologist. But the information is sufficient to guide us through the subsequent chapters that fully engage both the sides of the brain.  <br /> <br />We now live in an era of abundance (the wide range of goods at rock bottom prices at the neighbourhood shopping mall), Automation ( computers take over repetitive jobs) and emergence of Asia ( off shoring of white collar jobs at fractional costs). Today's products and services are an outcome of sequential, analytical and logical thought process of the L-centred professions. <br /> <br />To succeed in the next age which is conceptual, we need to wake up and kick start the right side of our brain argues the author. For example we need abilities to synthesise not just analyse. Synthesis is the ability to assemble the parts and see the whole thing while analysis is the ability to focus on specifics. The conceptual age needs high concept and high touch, a combination of right side capabilities along with the left side strengths. These then become the winning combination to differentiate, add value and succeed. <br /> <br />The author lists six senses or essential aptitudes - Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, play and Meaning that are the basic ingredients of the conceptual age. A chapter for each and a good reference list ( titled portfolio section) includes books and web sites that provide us with rich source of information for further study. <br /> <br />The examples quoted under every topic are simply great. To cite one such example in the chapter on Story : <br /> <br />The queen died. The king died. <br /> <br />The queen died and the king died of a broken heart. <br /> <br />The first line conveys a fact. The second line conveys a story and we can feel the love. Stories combine context and emotion and appeal to our hearts. Unfortunately, most professionals focus on facts. Doctors interrupt patients on an average once in 23 seconds looking only for clinical data. But if they listen to the patients' stories, the context and emotion can make a big difference, in addition to the facts. <br /> <br />Another good example is Design. Design is the process of bringing new forms that the world has never seen. It is a combination of utility and substance. The CEO of  a major car manufacturer claims that his company is in the art business and transportation is incidental. Design schools are the ones that can transform our products into things of joy. No wonder this profession has started gaining so much attention even in countries like India. ( Please refer to my review of the book \\" The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Gladwell. I am glad that my daughter has since chosen a course on Accessory Design and I am now able to appreciate her wisdom!) <br /> <br />The message is clear. The professional of the future is one who can appreciate the finer aspects of life that includes beauty, meaning and happiness.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed every moment of this book. Guess whom I am gifting it to ?	2005-08-17

The once unnoticed backward desert kingdom fragmented by infighting among several tribal warlords suddenly emerges as the world's focal point in the second half of the last century, thanks to the discovery of the giant and super giant oil fields. The first chapter of the book is a brief outline of this historic transformation under the leadership of king Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. The strategic importance of this kingdom on the global energy map was understood well by the \\"seven sisters\\" and President FD Roosevelt was quick to establish a politically important  relationship with the Saudi monarch. Oil it seemed was everywhere in this kingdom, and soon the world's most important oil company Aramco was born. Owned by foreign shareholders, this company does not lose much time to pump out the world's best crude oil in large quantities with a view to maximise shareholder returns in the short run. When the regional political scenario changed in the 1970's with the Arab-Israeli conflict, Saudi Arabia nationalises Aramco and renames it as Saudi Aramco. The story thus far is well known. What happens next is the core of the book. The secrecy of the oil reserves and field wise production figures, the myth of abundant unexploited reserves and the hypothesis that Saudi Arabia is running out of oil, and fast, is a interesting read. <br /> <br />The book gives an excellent in-dept description of oil exploration and production. For a lay reader with no formal knowledge the subject, the information is highly valuable to get a deep insight into the subject and appreciate how and why the world's largest oil fields in Saudi Arabia have matured and would soon go dry. In the absence of direct information from Saudi Aramco, the author has relied heavily on and quoted extensively from over 200 technical papers published by company officials at SPE. The evidence to test the hypothesis is circumstantial but abundant in line with the proverbial \\" ..the dog that did not bark\\".  <br /> <br />The book lists estimated production figures from the largest of the Saudi oil fields namely Ghawar, Safania, Abqaiq, Berri and Zuluf. While these five fields account for the kingdom's four fifth of oil production, Ghawar, the king of all kings accounts for over half of the total. At about 8 to 10 million barrels per day, the kingdom is the world's largest \\"swing producer\\" capable of opening or closing its taps whenever there is an abnormal rise or fall in global oil prices. Saudi Arabia is today the undisputed leader in the OPEC. The Saudi officials have periodically increased the estimates of proven reserves and claim to have the ability to increase oil production up to 25 million barrels per day if needed, within a decade,  and sustain it for over 50 years. This book is a well researched attempt to investigate this claim and prove it as highly misleading and practically impossible. <br /> <br />The giant and super giants have been producing and in fact over producing in the last five years, if we go by the evidence in the book. There are significant pressure drops due to \\"rate sensitivity\\" of the oil wells and the \\"water cut\\" has substantially increased. The infrastructure including Gas Oil Separation Plants and water pumping facilities are inadequate to scale up production. The Gas Oil Ratio seems to have gone up and Saudi officials who once flared all the gas are now viewing its as a valuable commodity for sale as well as for local energy needs. <br /> <br />My understanding of the upstream oil industry has certainly improved after reading this book. However the topic could have been easily discussed in half the number of pages. What disappointed me was that there is very little discussion in just one chapter at the end of the book on the possibility of the coming oil shockand implications for the world economy.  <br /> <br />While this book looks at the supply side of the problem I recommend  \\"Addicted to Oil : America's Relentless Drive for Energy Security\\" by Ian Rutledge to understand the problem from the demand side under tight supply constraints.	2005-08-15

Prof Sachs understands poverty , especially extreme poverty by actually visiting and living with those 1.1 billion human beings living in misery, struggling to keep their body and soul together. Nearly 20000 people die every day due to hunger and disease, and this is preventable, if only the rich nations contribute just 0.7 % of their incomes to rescue these less fortunate souls. What is needed according to the author is that those trapped in extreme poverty should be helped to survive and pushed to the first rung of the ladder of development so that they are given an opportunity to climb up towards a better living in a sustainable manner.  <br /> <br />External intervention is a must since there is absolutely no other possibility of helping these people in the absence of adequate capital at the disposal of the governments of the poor countries. Prof Sachs also makes a passionate appeal for write off of debts of poor nations by donor nations as an immediate measure. IMF and the World Bank may not agree, he argues, because they are staffed by economists educated mostly from the best universities of the developed world, whose knowledge about poverty is theoretical at best.  <br /> <br />The book deserves full credits on the following counts : <br /> <br />- A clear definition of poverty and its global severity <br />- A clinical approach to economics; treating poor countries the way a paediatrician would treat a sick child  <br />- A good description of how the poor are trapped in the vicious cycle based on his actual observation in the remotest villages of Africa and Asia <br />- The concept of capital, investments and development to aid in better understanding of the book <br />- The need for capital infusion, or targeted investments from the developed world <br />- How a small contribution can makea huge difference to end poverty in our generation <br />- Excellent discussion on the Millennium Development Goals of the UN <br />- Argument against the simplistic and biased approach of the rich against poor countries alleging them of mismanagement and corruption  <br />- Simple but highly insightful calculations and illustrations to substantiate his arguments <br /> <br />Prof Sachs is truly committed to the noble cause of eradicating poverty and at times becomes emotional and impatient. This is a book on mass salvation and the time for action is NOW.	2005-08-04

But this book takes a different view. Teachers, wrestlers, parents and for that matter anybody could lie, but numbers don't. This book is about asking unconventional questions about day to day events that we often ignore or fail to notice. The analysis of data and the answers are even more interesting. <br /> <br />As indicated at the beginning there is no common thread across the book. Every chapter could be read  in any sequence , but soon I realized that there is a common theme. In fact it is a completely new way of looking at Economics as applied to day to day events and is certainly informative and entertaining. To cite a good example, the phenomenon of the sudden drop in crime rates in New York city in the mid/late 1990's is well known. Malcolm Gladwell tries to explain this using \\"The broken window theory\\" in his book \\"The Tipping Point\\". On the other hand many articles have been written on NYPD's innovative and systematic approach to the problem that yielded results. \\"Leadership\\" by Rudolph W. Giuliani and also the book \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" by W. Chan Kim, Rene Mauborgne discusses this. Enter Freakonomics, Levitt takes a drastically new approach at analyzing the data and linking it to past events, explains this phenomenon as an outcome of the legalization of abortions in the US in the mid 70's !!!.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading every page of this book which tries to explain many such issues from very different perspectives.  <br /> <br />Intellectually stimulating, this book is a rare combination of academic entertainment and economics. No matter what one appreciates better, this book is bound to impress and in abundant measure.  <br />	2005-07-26

In terms of \\"energy grades\\" oil is a clear winner for powering Large Independent Mobile Machines ( LIMM ). Cars are the most popular LIMMs today and oil drives these machines. The concept of \\"eminent domain\\" in terms of the ownership of natural resources of a country establishes the supremacy of the State and the key to Government policies over oil reserves in various countries. The concept of \\"territorial imperative\\" links the valuation of shares of oil companies with their untapped proven oil reserves. Since oil is a depleting asset, oil companies should keep moving across our planet's surface in search of new reserves. <br /> <br />The core theme of the book is around the American automobile industry and its linkage with America's foreign policy in its quest to keep feeding the millions of energy hungry vehicles on its roads. The book claims that the public transport system was systematically dismantled in America to aid the growth of the market for cars. Cheap oil was then a necessity to make their running costs affordable. Cars are very closely linked to the American culture and the country has the highest ownership of about 832 cars per thousand population. In per capita terms Americans own more than double the number of cars, use them for double the mileage per year, and own cars that are bigger and consume nearly double the quantity of fuel per mile in comparison with Europe. Things were fine till such time America had plenty of oil in her own land. Suddenly \\"Hubbert's Peak\\" becomes a reality and in 1974 America was caught off guard  by the oil shock. <br /> <br />What follows is an exciting read on the impact of America's external dependence for her oil . With over 11 million barrels of the daily consumption of 20 million barrels being imported, American oil companies are now driven by the territorial imperative need to find large oil wells outside America. Unfortunately over aquarter of these proven reserves are in \\"not so friendly\\" or \\"politically unstable\\" countries whose governments exercise the eminent domain over the precious commodity.  <br /> <br />The book discusses the following points very convincingly : <br /> <br />- In the desperate search for oil, America is endangering the environment in Alaska <br />- The present US government is friendly to American oil companies  <br />- Oil companies would like to maximize their wealth through larger control of global oil reserves and simultaneously maintain a higher price for oil <br />-  America's need to diversify its oil imports away from the Persian Gulf <br />- The Caspian reserves are not so promising as once believed <br />- The Gulf  finally holds the key to global oil supplies and prices <br />- America's indifference to switch over to more fuel efficient vehicles <br />- The recent American Invasion of Iraq as a means to create an alternative to Saudi supplies <br />- Current proven reserves, their global distribution and the likely supply and demand scenarios till 2050  <br />- Scenarios of surge in demand for oil from fast growing countries like China and India <br />- Need for alternative energy sources  <br /> <br />Many of the conclusions are debatable. But the book establishes a clear logic in the linkage between foreign policy and oil. <br /> <br />References mentioned in the notes at the end of the book are very detailed and can be a good list for any researcher on the topic of oil.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-29

This is Bangalore , India's silicon valley from where Thomas Friedman starts this book. He is amazed to see the variety of work that is being off-shored to India, ranging from call centres to high end IT application development. The best of the top multinationals with world class facilities operate out of  this city. \\"The playing field has been levelled\\" remarks the CEO of Infosys, one of India's most respected IT companies and suddenly it strikes to Mr Friedman -\\" The World is flat\\". What follows is an unparalleled analysis of Globalization with a futuristic perspective from a columnist whose deep understanding of the topic and command of the English language can flatten all critics. The book runs into 496 pages, and is not flat but fat. But as rightly mentioned by Mr Friedman in another context, fat is not bad. There is good fat and bad fat and this book is full of the latter that keeps us warm and a store of energy for the future.    Globalization is categorised into three versions. Globalization 1.0 till 1800s dominated by countries trading with each other,  Globalisation 2.0 till 1990s by multinationals and Globalization 3.0 - the one we are experiencing currently that affects individuals in a world that is connected and flat.    The ten forces that flattened the world - The collapse of the Berlin Wall, Netscape internet browser, Workflow software, Open sourcing, Off-shoring, Out-sourcing, In-sourcing, Supply chaining, Informing and The Steroids of digitization sound like the ten commandments. The definition of each factor, the clarity of the examples and the inter linkages between the factors makes for a long chapter that forms the foundation of this book.    In a flat world, no longer are jobs protected within secure national boundaries. The Indians and Chinese with high technical skills can offer services at a fraction of the cost working from their home towns. Many Americans are unfortunately not fully prepared to face this reality argues Mr Friedman. While the global economic pie as a whole would grow in line with Ricardo's theory of Comparative advantage, there would be frictions in the initial adjustments when it happens. Compassionate flatness is the approach with guarantee of long term employability through constant upgradation of skills and a overhaul and streamlining of the current form of social security laws to enable free movement to different jobs in America. Also, the steady decline in the number of science and engineering graduates and the cut in budget for scientific research is a cause for worry in America says Mr Friedman. President Kennedy's vision to put a man on the moon created a nation wide movement in science and technology during the cold war giving America a lead in their knowledge and capabilities, which is now is receding.     The book devotes one section each to discuss how companies and developing countries should cope with the flatness in the world in which they operate. The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention that Mr Freidman introduced in The Lexus and the Olive Tree is replaced with  The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention. The earlier theory suggests that no two countries that had McDonalds had gone to war against each other. In the current context of Global Supply Chaining, citing Dell as a classical case study, Mr Friedman suggests that no to countries that form a part of a global supply chain can afford a war since the long term economic consequences of losing foreign trade and investments are too high in comparison to temporary political gains. In mid 2002 when Indian and Pakistani troops were on the brink of a military confrontation, the enormous effort undertaken by large multinationals (like GE for example) with substantial and strategic investments in India was a new factor that prevented the conflict. \\"We bring good things to life\\".    There are forces that are likely todisrupt the flatness and Mr Friedman comes out with hard hitting and emotional arguments not to fear them but to tackle them effectively. America should not spread fear, but spread hope says Mr Friedman. Forget 9/11, remember 7/4.     Unbiased and passionate view of globalization as a means to ensure peace and prosperity to mankind in a flat world.	2005-06-06

This book is logically split into several sections and chapters ranging from Strategy, Performance Management, Mergers and Acquisitions, Recruitment, Promotion and finally a chapter on answers to questions on China and other issues not addressed in the other chapters.  <br /> <br />True to his style, candor is the hallmark of this book. One may not fully agree with Dr Welch on many issues, and he has not changed his opinion and conviction on some of the policies that he rigorously implemented at GE. But this book is an excellent summary in crisp and simple text, distilling his over four decades of experience in working for and leading one of the most admired companies of this planet. <br /> <br />Those interested in a serious discussion of management theories and looking for an approach based on data and research may be disappointed. But if one is looking for what works and what does not in reality, this book is sure to impress. <br /> <br />Content is one thing about books. What makes this book very different from what could have otherwise been published as a summary of concepts is the first person narrative style of the author. Every page is filled with energy, strong belief and commitment to the ideas discussed.  After all this is a book based on true personal experience and not a discourse on theoretical concepts.  <br /> <br />Dr Welch, thank you so much for this wonderful gift to next generation managers.	2005-05-19

To list a few interfaces, the topics covered in the book are a blend of Literature, Philosophy, Mathematics and Finance. I must confess that my understanding of the contents after reading such a high density text is partial, but I am determined to read it again. <br /> <br />The book is an excellent discussion on the concept of probability and asymmetries in real life. We get a clear view as to how the human brain naturally lacks the ability to grasp this concept and is trained to think linear while life is full of non linear outcomes. <br /> <br />Imagine a sturdy typewriter over which a group of monkeys are allowed to dance. If billions of these creatures are at work, statistically, one of them might produce the Iliad, just by chance. Imagine if we were to honour this fellow and expect him to produce the Odyssey next.  <br /> <br />In another instance a clever trickster selects 10000 names at random from the telephone directory and sends them a recommendation to buy a particular stock. By the end of the week his forecast comes true to 5000 of these mortals. The next week he mails another recommendation to these 5000 and after the repetition of this process for a few weeks, we have about 125 hard core believers who are willing to pay anything for advice from this portfolio expert.  <br /> <br />The millionaire next door may just be an outcome of chance, the lucky monkey on the typewriter. However the society showers lots of praise on him for his vision, hard work,  business acumen and the like. <br /> <br />When the author was asked once if he was expecting the market to rise or to fall in a particular week, he says that it would rise. But he sells calls in apparent contradiction to his own opinion. The explanation is very interesting. He did expect with 70 % probability that the market would rise, but very slightly, but there was a chance of 30 % that it would fall steeply.  <br /> <br />There are several outcomes in life and in markets that are rare - black swans. But these are the exceptions that provide great opportunities. The author says that he is one of those happy crisis hunters who may lose small amounts of money frequently but makes tons of it during rare volatile events. The author uses the Monte Carlo simulator to visualise outcomes where mathematical equations are too complex or provide partial answers. <br /> <br />Entertaining, educative and at times too sharp in criticism of \\"proven theories\\" chances are that we have more questions than answers to many problems that we confront in our daily life.  <br /> <br />Journalists and MBAs  should be forewarned that they might feel like the creatures on the typewriter after reading this book.	2005-05-09

I could not think of a better source that this book to explain her this universal phenomenon. <br /> <br />A new product, a management concept, a new book, a movie or simply a restaurant next door can suddenly become a great success with little advertising. We also see that some great products fail to take off despite the best marketing efforts. <br /> <br />Malcolm Gladwell takes the analogy of epidemics to explain the concept of the tipping point. The three factors  - The Law of the Few, The Stickiness Factor and The power of Context are explained in detail with excellent case studies. <br /> <br />Business success is based on acceptance of ideas, products and services by customers globally. Internal acceptance of company strategies and goals is also a vital factor. The Tipping Point is a book that can help managers in dealing with all stakeholders - internal and external.	2005-04-25

Thanks to the extravagant living backed by paper currency, America is today the world's largest debtor nation. Though debt by itself is not bad, it is dangerous both to the borrower and the lender if it is not backed by productive assets.  This book is about the origin and consequences of such a situation and the currency that has helped inflate the global monetary bubble on a scale that is threatening to burst on our faces.  <br /> <br />First the book gives a good definition of money as a standard of value, store of value and a medium of exchange. Going by this definition, over the centuries mankind has experimented with several monetary equivalents including cattle, sea shells, metals and the like. Whatever the medium, there was a definite asset equivalent attempted to be stored in money. This system got refined over the years and ultimately gold emerged as the undisputed monetary standard in the nineteenth century. Under this system, governments and central banks had to maintain gold equivalent in their vaults for the paper currency issued by them. Excessive government spending was thus effectively curtailed and exchange rates were automatically balanced.  It is the gradual deviation and debasement and later the outright abandonment of this system in 1971 that seems to have led to today's situation where the dollar has just over 1% of its value as gold reserves with the Fed. <br /> <br />In an imminent possibility of a virtual run on the dollar by creditor nations and oil exporting countries, the dollar is bound to plunge. Gold expressed in dollar equivalent will surge. This logic does not need any further explanation. But what is more interesting is the discussion on alternate investment strategies that can outperform gold in real terms. Silver emerges as a surprising and sure alternative. Unlike gold, silver gets consumed in large quantities in industrial use and not reclaimed. Hence the quantity of silver available above the ground is actually reducing. When there is a rush to convert paper currency into precious metals, the authors expect silver to rise faster than gold due to these fundamentals. If gold is a Boeing 747, silver will be an F-16 is a good analogy. <br /> <br />The book discusses some facts on mining of gold and different categories of companies involved in this industry. Depending on factors like asset base, quality of mines, financial and operational leverage, quality of management and country risk, each of these are analyzed for their risks and potential returns.  <br /> <br />Numismatics also gets a fair share of the coverage. <br /> <br />The book is however bound to come under severe criticism on the following grounds.  <br /> <br />- Gold is not the only possible store of value  <br />- The fundamental principles on which monetary expansion kick starts economic expansion is completely ignored <br />- In a global economy where currencies are tightly linked and freely traded, only the dollar is isolated for criticism <br />- Unbridled monetary expansion is bad, but return to gold standard is ridiculous in a modern knowledge based economy <br />- Large transaction and holding costs in buying gold is not the efficient way to deal with investments. <br /> <br />Despite these shortcomings, gold will continue to retain its excellent qualities and reading this book will only add glitter to this noble metal whenever you see it.	2005-04-19

The global automobile industry rolls out 40 million vehicles every year. Of these 15 million are from USA where at about 20000 dollars a piece, this is a $ 300 billion industry. The industry is dominated by a few players who have consolidated over the years. This structure and size gives them enormous power and leverage in dealing with their suppliers. Traditionally the big three companies have followed strong command and control structure in dealing with their suppliers, employees and dealers. It is not uncommon to see unilateral cost reduction mandates, threat of switching over to new suppliers or similar tough measures to reduce the per unit price of the components they procure. The automobile supply chain is highly complex involving thousands of suppliers in different tiers. Under the current system each layer is isolated from the next. This  traditional way of doing business or \\"adversarial commerce\\" is harmful to all stakeholders according to the author. The book is about a closer examination of the malady and to recommend a new way of doing business that is beneficial in the long run for entire value chain, right from the producer of raw materials to the end consumer.   <br /> <br />The Japanese manufactures on the other hand practice a different approach defined as collaborative commerce. Here the OEMs involve the suppliers in all stages manufacturing including joint goal setting, treating them as partners and an extension of their organization. This is a model that operates in an atmosphere of trust and cooperation and the suppliers are deeply involved in and share the costs and profits of a win-win approach. Several advantages including supplier investments in development costs leading to superior products with shorter time to market is a key factor for the global success of these firms. Chrysler's success in implementing this approach under thebanner \\"SCORE\\" is the main theme of the book. <br /> <br />The book is based on the author's rich experience in the automobile industry. It also contains recommendations for implementation and the challenges to overcome in companies not used to collaborative practices. Written in first person narrative style, it is worth reading once. However, sharp criticism of some executives could have better been avoided.	2005-04-12

Each of these are aimed either at improving our chances of survival and winning or just a description of the phenomenon under study. However only a few eventually emerge as useful frameworks and remain in the managerial toolkit for successful deployment. There is definitely no \\"one best way\\" to manage competition. We can at best put our plans to the rigorous scrutiny of the wisdom of research conducted over the years and attempt to maximize the probability of success. Sometimes we need a totally new way of looking at things and suddenly a whole new world of possibilities emerge. Blue Ocean Strategy is a book that belongs to this class and proposes a radically new perspective to the issue. <br /> <br />The book opens with the concept of  Blue Oceans and how we can create new uncontested markets through value innovation. The Strategy Maps that give us a good pictorial comparison of market opportunities is sure to emerge as a powerful tool in most top management presentations like Michael Porter's Model or the McKinsey Framework did during in the last decades. However the book has not detailed the means by which the important value factors are identified and sequencing is done. This would be useful when we are dealing with dozens of factors and the different visual pictures that emerge based on sequencing. <br /> <br />While at one time Ford was successful based on Model T , mass production was soon overtaken and even ridiculed by customization to the extent we devised flexible manufacturing with batch size of one. We now seem to be going back in time when the authors recommend aggregation of similarities across segments as one of the strategies to create Blue Oceans. This reminds me of the double helix model ( \\"Clock Speed\\" by Charles Fine). <br /> <br />The approach of value innovation is to identify those parameters that are valued most by customers and offer these  in a mix that iscost effective and highly valuable. Excess of functionality not utilized is removed and functionality that is inadequate is amplified. This has a strong resemblance to and perhaps a corollary to \\"Disruptive Innovations\\" as described by Prof Clayton Christensen in his path breaking \\"Innovator's Dilemma\\". <br /> <br />The six steps - Search, planning, Scale, Business Model, Organization and Management for formulating and deployment of the strategy is neat.  <br /> <br />There are numerous case studies across various chapters that are so diverse that at times I lost direction in the ocean. Appendix 1 describes three industries - Cars ( how we go to work), Computers ( what we use at work) and the Movie Theaters ( where we relax after work). It would have been great if the authors had restricted to cases from these across all the chapters to lend continuity and clarity.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-11

My impression about China being a low cost manufacturing base and a major exporter of cheap labor intensive products stands corrected after reading this book. The most populous country is way ahead in her spirited economic journey and the forecasts of becoming the world's largest economy in PPP terms within the next two decades seems realistic and achievable.  <br /> <br />With a brief introduction and prospects of a glorious future, the book gives us a broad historical perspective of the Chinese history and culture. The rich heritage and Confucian principles have withstood the test of time. The country was responsible for important inventions like paper and gunpowder. Unfortunately the powder was not dry when needed against foreign invasions and many inventions remained on paper. This humiliation and the setback during the first few decades of the communist regime set the Middle Kingdom's clock back in terms of economic progress. However the economic reforms launched during the last quarter of the twentieth century is a massive effort to restore the lost glory of the great nation. <br /> <br />The book points out several dichotomies about China. It is a communist country but the share of the government in the economy is very low. It attracts large foreign investments but does not protect intellectual property rights. Highly competitive markets in some segments and huge subsidies in others. High savings rates but weak capital allocations. These aspects coupled with the tight bureaucratic communist party rule over the executive, legislature and judiciary makes it a highly complex place to understand and do business in for outsiders. However for most multinational companies, the Chinese market is too big to be ignored and it is worth understanding and putting up with some problems for a short while. <br /> <br />If piracy is about stealing ideas and using them in ones own products, fake and counterfeit are about imitating branded products and selling them under the same brand name. China is a global leader in this area too. It is no surprise that with a corrupt bureaucracy such practices thrive incurring revenue losses conservatively estimated in excess over $ 20 billion annually to global firms. This appears to be the most challenging area to be tackled. While manufacturers of spurious items make hefty profit margins with no costs on research, the rightful owners of the brands are saddled with warranty costs and loss of reputation for bad products in the market. The book has devoted a chapter to discuss this menace. <br /> <br />Several Industries ranging from toys, electronics and home appliances are discussed extremely well in terms of how China is emerging as a global leader in such items and also how fast the country is moving up the value chain. <br /> <br />However there are major risks associated with China that can spillover and might threaten a regional or  global economic meltdown. The Chinese currency is pegged to the dollar and undervalued. The excessive dependence on external trade with one major trading partner adds to the risk. The country is very weak in services especially financial services and this is further amplified by huge bad loans sitting on the books of Chinese banks. The speed of progress and transition of the economic landscape needs extreme care and dexterity under such conditions. <br /> <br />The book's analysis of how the China factor impacts the American or Mexican economies can be extended to many other countries using the same logic and framework. <br /> <br />A must read for managers, economists, MBA students and all those who are interested in the understanding the great economic engine of the century.	2005-03-30

Instantly, I realized that my decision to buy this book from amongst a large display at  a book shop  at the local airport was one such \\"blink\\" decision. <br /> <br />The author introduces the concept very well. I was immediately convinced that it is important to realize the power of \\"thin slicing\\" and the need to understand and cultivate the skill of harnessing its power in personal and professional life. The quantum and the degree to which it exists and manifests differs significantly in each of us. The book aims to explain the phenomenon, situations under which it is mostly right or consistently flawed and the means by which one can build on this powerful mental resource.  <br /> <br />The chapters that follow are exciting with numerous cases across diverse fields that can interest a wide range of professionals. As the pages flow, it appeared to me that this was a case of discussing the concept more and more without following a systematic framework for analysis and application. No doubt the case studies are interesting, but then the objective of the book should have been beyond narration of stories and to build and present a powerful tool for successful deployment. The author does discuss one such model used by doctors in a hospital for diagnosis of heart attacks which substantially improves the chances of correct diagnosis. <br /> <br />Worth reading once. However this can wait till you finish reading other books in your priority list.	2005-03-24

The chances are that the conclusions based on such work are at best an analysis of the past with little use for the future. <br /> <br />Jim Roger's approach for investing is based on commonsense, his personal experience and perhaps a strong gut feel of things to come. Commodities are the next big best bet to put our money into at least for another decade as per this book that is written in a simple non jargon approach . <br /> <br />First it starts demystifying commodities and looks at them as an investment option as any other like stocks or bonds. It then introduces the concept of supply and demand and why in the recent past  demand has outstripped supply and how the large time gap needed to build up capacities in commodities can cause a sustained bull market. There is also a chapter devoted to explain the functioning of global commodity markets and the technical terms used. Various commodity indices are analysed in detail.   <br /> <br />The author is very bullish on commodities in general and on commodities like lead, sugar and oil in particular. The book ultimately helps us analyse any commodity using the simple logic of supply and demand so effectively and elegantly used for identifying the winners. China emerges as the undisputed global growth engine of demand. <br /> <br />Today a leading business newspaper in India carried a news item titled \\"Commodity Prices Booming on Speculative Interests\\". Perhaps the word \\"speculative\\"  is not appropriate when real demand outstrips supply.	2005-03-10
US	50954482	R3EWKX7A8Q0FI6	0618239774	978444819	The End of Oil: On the Edge of a Perilous New World	Books	5	5	6	N	N	In search of clean and affordable energy	Energy and prosperity seem to be closely correlated. However the party cannot continue endlessly if we do not pay attention to the limited availability of fossil fuels like oil and the dangerous side effects like CO2 emissions and global warming. The book starts with focus on oil, its global distribution and consumption patterns. The important issue that emerges is the amount proven reserves held by OPEC countries and the huge political divide between OPEC and the developed world that accounts for the largest share of consumption of this progressively depleting commodity. It is interesting to note that a small variation in supply can cause a high fluctuation in oil prices in the international markets, and this is what makes OPEC the most influential player in this volatile market. On the other hand, as shown in the 80's, technological solutions to improve fuel economies of automobiles can significantly reduce oil consumption driving oil prices deep south. But then, the author explains that America is largely \\"energy illiterate\\" and gets back to life as usual once again behind the wheels of SUVs that are notorious for their appetite for gasoline. Oil companies seem to be actually encouraging consumption while the fact is that mankind cannot increase limited global oil reserves even by a drop. The already committed investments running into hundreds of billions of dollars in oil exploration, refining and downstream products need to be fully recovered financially. An increase in the price of crude above say $ 40 a barrel once again makes it economically attractive to search for oil in deeper and inaccessible terrains. The game continues, but not till we exhaust the proverbial last drop of oil.    The book then shifts to a detailed discussion on energy and compares the availability, calorific values and pollution profile of coal, oil and gas. Natural gas, seems to be emerging as a reliable and clean bridge fuel to oil, though it has its own problems of transportation andstorage. That is why it is considered a \\"stranded asset\\". Hydrogen and renewables seem to be the ultimate winners in search of clean and abundant source of fuel for the next generation. The Hydrogen fuel cell however appears to have a long way to travel in terms of its cost trajectory to make it affordable for cars. The other issue is the search for the best source and process for producing hydrogen to feed these engines safely and conveniently. Advances in solar cell technologies in countries like Japan have significantly increased their efficiencies to about 40 %. Wind power is emerging as a dominant alternative in countries like Germany where small producers in remote wind farms are backed by fiscal and monetary incentives by state legislations.     Coming back to the linkage between energy and prosperity, the world's most promising economic engines of the future - China and India have started humming. They have many more cylinders lined up for power and are not so efficient when it comes to fuel efficiency and pollution norms. They too have a right to prosper and in the process consume energy. This calls for a global perspective and co-operation in solving the global issues. For example an investment of a million dollars can produce far higher marginal reductions in pollution in a Chinese thermal power plant than in a modern facility in the developed world. The book explains such issues in detail.    I would appreciate if the author can include some tables at the end of the book on important data like distribution of known oil reserves, oil production and consumption, oil prices, comparison of various energy sources in terms of cost per unit, efficiencies and emissions.	2005-01-25

This book as acknowledged duly by Prof Prahalad has been an eye opener in unlocking the vast untapped potential of dead capital and entrepreneurial abilities of over two thirds of the world's poor who are trapped outside the bell jar of market based economies. Prof Prahlad shows us the way to social transformation and economic freedom while providing  choice with dignity for the individuals through a market based ecosystem involving large multinationals, NGOs, Governments and the individuals themselves. <br /> <br />Before reading the book it is advisable the see the videos. These are true case studies across continents and industry verticals at the BOP. One cannot resist the temptation of reading the book from cover to cover soon after. <br /> <br />Addressing the huge BOP market needs innovative approaches. Large multinationals that try to transplant high end technologies from developed countries into developing worlds often meet with markets that are \\"not yet ready\\" or \\"too small\\". Instead they need innovative approaches to develop products that address the needs at the \\"lower end\\" of the market. Perhaps Prof Clayton Christensen's theory on disruptive innovations can be well utilized for this. Incumbents ignore these segments that are huge market opportunities for new entrants. <br /> <br />Prof Prahalad introduces the process of \\"inclusive capitalism\\" as a means of viewing the poor as individual consumers, creating choices with entrepreneurial skills, and providing them the dignity and path to prosperity. One of the important dimensions to achieve this is to ensure \\"Transaction Governance Capacity\\" or TGC which is basically the availability of the necessary legal framework for honouring market transactions and enforcing contracts. This reminds me of another recent book \\"Culture and Prosperity\\" by the eminent economist John Kay that talks of \\"Disciplined Pluralism\\" in developed countries. <br /> <br />The case studies prepared by Prof Prahalad's students under his supervision book are excellent. I could really appreciate the Indian cases due to first hand interaction with some of these household names here in India. <br /> <br />Bound to be not just another excellent business book, but a roadmap for business strategy for multinationals who do not wish to ignore two thirds of humanity.	2005-01-04
US	50954482	R1ILX9LR2M7XGS	1591391857	773753166	Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Putting Theory into Practice	This book is not only a logical extension of the Prof Christensen's previous two books, but is also a book that excels on its own. The first few chapters reinforce the theories on Innovation and quickly leads us to a framework for analysis in line with the title. Sensing Change, Competitive Battles, Non-market forces and Strategic Choices are the four dimensions of this framework that apply the principles of Disruptive Innovation. Using this framework it is not only interesting as to how the authors are able to explain the outcomes in the past but also enable us to forecast the future of competitive battles and technology trajectories with reasonable accuracy. The authors do mention at the end of the book that there will be exceptions that may not fit into this theoretical framework, but the aim of all theories is to improve our understanding of the phenomenon under study. If this is the definition and objective of a sound theory, this book meets this goal.  <br /> <br />Is it possible to evolve a quantitative model that can be used as a tool for answering important questions on technology and competition based on this theory ? In my opinion it worth attempting one even if such a tool lacks perfection in the first attempt. This model by itself might be disruptive in nature and can quickly climb the path of improvement in accuracy. <br /> <br />Five industries are analyzed in detail in this book - Education, Health Care, Aviation, Semi Conductors and Telecom in addition to a chapter on global competitiveness of companies and countries. These chapters and detailed, and explain the technological issues with simplicity for a non-technocrat to understand. At the end there is a quick summary of concepts used in this book , which can be termed as an executive summary of The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution in one chapter. <br /> <br />One Industry that is conspicuous by its absence in the detailed analysis of this book is the Automobile Industry. In the earlier books there were references to disruptive technologies in this sector - the electric car for example. The recent abrupt rise in oil prices, international concerns on the politics and shortage of  this fuel, and the vast demand for meeting transportation needs in developing countries at low cost makes this industry a fertile ground for disruptive innovation. Has this industry overshot the needs of mass users ? What would be the structure of this industry in a scenario of imminent modularization ? Which companies are likely to adopt disruptive strategies in un-served markets ? What will be the technologies and how will incumbents respond ? What strategies would auto component suppliers adopt ? Is the under $ 2000 car a possibility ? Will there be free standing value networks for such products that will be ignored by incumbents in large developing markets ?. This book certainly provides us a good framework to answer such questions and is bound to generate such debates in many other industries not covered in the book.	2004-12-27

This water body has potential energy that can be tapped if we can make the water turn turbines at a power plant located at a lower elevation. This energy lies waste if we fail to recognize the potential or are unable to build the technology that converts it into electricity. The same analogy is applicable to the vast amounts of dead capital in developing and former communist countries. These countries together have about 10 Trillion Dollars of such untapped capital due to the inability of the legal and political system to integrate it into the national system of legitimized existence. In the absence of clear titles and legal safe guards, large amounts of assets continue in their extralegal domain.  <br /> <br />In contrast, in the developed west, every piece of land or building is meticulously recorded in a central database with accurate details of ownership. Here the word property needs to be distinguished from its physical form to that of the legal aspect of ownership and title that can be accounted for and converted into fungible capital.  <br /> <br />Once capitalized, the asset can be developed, mortgaged and traded, leading to a large stream of economic activities which in turn generates income and accumulates more capital. If this is so simple, then why doesn't the developing world recognize this vital aspect that is key to prosperity ?. That is precisely the mystery that the book attempts to solve. <br /> <br />The book excels on the following counts: <br /> <br />- The hypothesis on dead capital <br />- Listing of and discussion of the mysteries of capital <br />- An in-depth analysis of the issue of extralegal assets in developing countries from a legal, social and historical perspective <br />- A chapter devoted to the US experience over the last 300 years <br />- Suggestions for changes in legal and political systems to align with the ground reality of social systems and to kick start the capitalization process. <br /> <br />In a certain developing country where the government had no records on land ownership in its remote villages, the dogs that roamed freely in the country side knew precisely the boundaries of their owners' lands and would start barking immediately if a stranger crossed the line into their territory. Governments struggling with outdated records and impractical laws on public property better consult their dogs when in doubt.  <br />	2004-12-07

Yesterday's innovative products are today's commodities. Industry Clock Speeds are increasing at faster rates thanks to the digital age. Multinationals are relocating  manufacturing to low cost locations and realigning their supply chains. Shareholders are impatient for growth in revenues and earnings. This book is a guide to success in such challenging times. <br /> <br />Patterns and frameworks are key to understanding and analysis of problems. The authors present a simple framework consisting of External Realities, Internal processes and Financial Targets as the three interlinked dimensions of their Business Model. Initially this model appears to be too simplistic and common sense approach that does not add much value. As the book progresses into specific case studies on companies in a wide range of industries ( like Cisco, Thomson, Home Depot, 3M, EMC ), the depth of understanding of business issues, attention to detail and the rigor of analysis to build up the ability to propose and execute successful strategies are truly world class. The Business Model as it is named in the book is a tool for reaching clarity in action in the maze and fog of complexity. It is intense, iterative and intuitive , providing a tool that acts as the lens for viewing the business world in the continuous search for opportunities and success.  <br /> <br />The distinction between cyclical change and structural change in industry is clearly illustrated. Many business failures are largely due to the inability to recognize this fundamental difference as it happens unannounced and unnoticed. Incumbents refuse to realize this reality. They are used to selective listening from executives who either do not acknowledge or refuse to confront the reality on the ground. Business leaders need to remove this lacuna at all levels and instead encourage and aggregate diverse opinions. A stomach for touch action with inner strength differentiates the winners from the rest. CEOs also need to cure themselves of Quarteritis, and shift gears towards sustainable long term financial targets rather than short term symptomatic remedies. <br /> <br />A rare combination of Business Strategy and Leadership in one book. Embrace this book and confront reality.	2004-12-07

Though this book is directly from John Yokoyama, the owner of the world famous Pike Place Fish, it lacks the kind of inspirational and personal touch that made the Fish! philosophy so famous. At best it appears to be a nice opportunity to hear the story of the great place from the owner himself but there is much room for improving the sequencing of topics, the narrative style and in bringing out the true excitement of the place. It appears at many places that too much importance is given to employees' conformity to the vision of becoming world famous and the business is run as a proprietary concern, enforcing the views of the owner on most occasions. <br /> <br />One incident in the book that really moved me - Two fish mongers who fly to Minneapolis to entertain a child who is in hospital diagnosed with leukemia.  One of the fish mongers himself had undergone treatment for a tumor and his empathy for this little girl and his own emotions are the at the core of the Fish! philosophy. <br /> <br />The contribution of Jim Bergquist, the consultant who was instrumental in bringing about the transformation at Pike Place Fish is acknowledged, but not fully elaborated. <br /> <br />This book may not fly off the book stands like Fish!.	2004-11-09

Cognitive problems are situations when we need to decide on the most likely outcome of a certain event like guessing the winner in the presidential polls. The second type of problem is termed as coordination problem when groups need to coordinate their behavior as drivers do on a highway. The next level is the problem of cooperation where self-interested and distrustful individuals need to contribute and work together even when narrow self-interest would dictate not to do so. The system of taxation is an excellent example of this type of problem. <br /> <br />Then there is a good definition of four parameters ( if I may use the term) of Diversity, Independence, Decentralization and Aggregation under which groups operate. The book starts with examples of situations where groups of ordinary individuals with average knowledge outperform experts in specific cases on cognitive problems and it proceeds to discuss situations under coordination and cooperation problems. There are situations when crowds are remarkably accurate in their collective judgment or wisdom, while in certain situations they are absolutely dumb. Hence it may not be right to say that the crowds are always right. Bubbles in financial markets should confirm this. Traffic jams is another example that we witness every day. The question then on the judgment or behavior of crowds is under what circumstances do crowds know better or do better and when to rely on them for their collective wisdom and equally important, when not to rely on them for they may be far away from reality in certain situations. Scores of examples are discussed in this book under separate chapters for each problem and we do get some good insights and understanding of the topic from the cases discussed. <br /> <br />Is it possible to evolve a framework for the three types of problems and the four parameters to predict outcomes under various combinations of these ? In my opinion it is worth attempting one such framework that can at least suggest the most probable outcomes under different situations. If so, I would recommend this to be added as an annexure in the next edition of this book.	2004-11-08

The rapid growth witnessed in the region during the 1990's was suddenly halted by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Now that the storm is over, a new game has started. This book is about winning this round of the game.  <br /> <br />Asia has her own distinctive culture and business traditions, inherent strengths and weaknesses. Till 1997, most of the national economies operated in isolation and  local companies enjoyed this protection. Companies resorted to opportunistic diversification, often into unrelated businesses, and profited through rent collection, asset inflation and arbitrage opportunities. The focus of operations was on commoditization and manufacturing efficiencies. Meanwhile one should also recognize the traditional strengths of Asian businesses in terms of building local networks through relationships, speed of response to grab opportunities and adaptation to change.  <br /> <br />In the new game post the crisis of 1997, new strategies need to be adopted for success in Asia. This applies to both Asian companies, multinationals operating in Asia and the new alliances that emerge between Asian companies and the big players from outside. <br /> <br />Firstly the national fiefdoms have been broken and Asian countries while attracting foreign investments are also simultaneously encouraging national companies to invest abroad. The Asian customer is also becoming more demanding in terms of variety and quality of goods and services. <br /> <br />The book highlights five major areas that need to be addressed by companies in Asian markets : <br /> <br />1. Step change in productivity - The focus here is on total productivity and not just manufacturing costs, and the need to improve supply chain efficiencies and administrative processes. <br />2. Innovation - Asia suffers from innovation deficit as shown by the very low investments as percentage of corporate revenues spent on innovation. Asia has traditionally valued investments in tangible assets and not on building intangible assets. <br />3. Branding - Of the top 60 global brands, only 4 are from Asia - 3 from Japan (Sony, Toyota and Honda) and one from Korea (Samsung). Value creation and capture is the core concept of branding. <br />4. Creating a new breed of Asian Multinationals - Ability to work across borders as Pan-Asian companies with integrated operations and not just investments abroad. <br />5. Consolidating the Asian playing field - Ability to shape rather than to be dictated by changes in the new game. <br /> <br />A chapter each is devoted to the topics listed above and the issues are discussed in detail. Excellent examples of some business cases aid the understanding of concepts.  <br /> <br />The book is unbiased, objective, well researched and presented in logical steps resulting in a model for strategy formulation for winning in the new Asian game. The scope of this book is largely limited to ASEAN + 3 (China, Japan and Korea). The rest of Asia, India in particular, deserves another book. <br /> <br />While Asia is a new and big opportunity of this century, the author aptly concludes that there will be a sharper divide between winners and losers. This book will certainly help us to be on the better side of this divide.	2004-10-25

But  this is not the first time in history that mankind is experiencing the flow of goods and services across oceans and continents. Multinationals have lessons to learn from the past if they are to succeed in the future. This book is a crisp experience summary of some typical multinationals spanning four centuries, several industries and across continents. The scope is however restricted to companies originating in developed countries and their operations in developing countries.  <br /> <br />Growth rates having hit their plateaus in the developed world, the scene is now shifting to countries like China and India, the most populous nations with the highest growth potential and market size for most industries. Multinationals traditionally have focussed on marketing and manufacturing as their core competencies and looked upon social interactions and politics in host nations as peripheral activities supported through public relations. This book demonstrates the importance of understanding intricate social and political issues in local societies and that multinationals in the past have failed to anticipate, let alone shape the outcomes that can have severe impact on their business, image and survival. Backed by a impressive list of references, the book discusses the hypothesis of the role and complexity of interactions of multinationals with host societies and governments and the failure of these corporates to handle situations arising out of making simplistic assumptions. The results can be devastating in countries with low political stability.  <br /> <br />The author's grasp of the ground realities in various countries, the impartial analysis of events and the logical linkage to the hypothesis is superb. The book is not a complete coverage of business history of multinationals operating in developing countries, but an attempt to highlight the importance of and the means to achieve sustainable co-existence with local cultures and politics. The case studies are just the right samples to derive meaningful inferences.  <br /> <br />Most multinationals today require their managers and employees to be sensitive to and respect local cultures and adapt rather than attempt to modify them. The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility has suddenly become a key word for corporate governance. On the other hand, forces of anti-globalization target multinationals to gain global attention.  <br /> <br />The maps and pictures add to the flavor of the ideal coffee table reading. A must on the bookshelf of all those who appreciate a very important dimension of managing across borders.	2004-10-12

I loved every word in this short book especially after a very recent Fred experience. I can confirm that Freds exist and we need to learn a lot from such great souls, though they may be employed in very ordinary jobs. <br /> <br />Last fortnight, while on a short vacation  with my family on the west coast of India we had engaged a taxi for four days for sight seeing. Suddenly there was a local strike on a sensitive political issue and all roads were blocked. While we were feeling very insecure and afraid of being caught in mob fury in the middle of our tour, the taxi driver made sure that he took us to our hotel safely, talking his way through small groups of miscreants who tried stopping vehicles from plying. We had to stay overnight at a hotel to continue the journey the next day when normalcy was restored. To my surprise, the taxi driver would not charge us anything for the extra time he had spent for us and on the other hand was feeling sorry that we were inconvenienced during our vacation. He invited us to visit the place once again so that he could take us to some more interesting places nearby. While he dropped us off at the airport, I just couldn't resist hugging him with a big THANK YOU from our family. I promptly rewarded him with a fat tip for taking such good care of us. Exceptional service from a very ordinary taxi driver.  <br /> <br />This book teaches us to become Freds, locate Freds and create Freds. Mark, I am grateful to you for this extraordinary book. I also salute the real Fred who works for the U.S. Postal service in Denver who inspired you to write the book.	2004-09-13

First, the book outlines the dimensions of technology and the emergence of the knowledge economy. Having missed the industrial age due to foreign occupation, India can hardly afford to miss the current opportunity in twenty first century. The world's largest democracy with over a sixth of the world's population has its numerous strengths to exploit and weaknesses to overcome. This book presents the vision and a plan of action to propel India into an orbit of prosperity by the end of the next decade.  <br /> <br />Five core sectors - Agriculture, Education and Health care, Infrastructure including Power, Information and Communication technologies and Strategic Sectors including Defense, Nuclear and Space Technologies are identified with an integrated nationwide approach for growth. <br /> <br />India still has about a quarter of her population living below the poverty line. The current food grain production of 200 Million MT has to reach 300 Million MT by 2020 using the same area of cultivable land. Though India ranks first in terms of global milk production, she ranks 54 th in terms of productivity. The country has over 560000 villages most of which lack basic infrastructure including drinking water. The book takes upon the challenge to reverse these conditions using technology as a catalyst of change. Using the abundant natural resources, rich bio-diversity and the 300 million youth with ignited minds, the country needs to step up its growth rate to double digits to realize the goal of a developed India by 2020 . The country needs to simultaneously achieve economic prosperity and national security and find its rightful place on this planet. Focused minds with determination and leadership are the need of the hour. <br /> <br />Dr Kalam, a technocrat of international repute demonstrates India's technological strengths in the areas of Defense, Aerospace, Information and Communication technologies and the need for linking the academics, Industry and research laboratories to fully leverage  these vital engines of growth. There were several instances where India was denied technical inputs by the developed world. Indian scientists and engineers took this upon themselves as a challenge and developed world class solutions indigenously. Technology denied proved to be technology gained. <br /> <br />There are separate chapters devoted to the focus areas with excellent case studies from his experience as a scientist.  <br /> <br />This book calls upon all Indian citizens to share the vision and join the mission to India's prosperity. We have a choice - Now or Never.	2004-09-06
US	50954482	R29RJPYFPAUDRR	0060587059	747189971	Culture and Prosperity: The Truth About Markets - Why Some Nations Are Rich but Most Remain Poor	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The mystery of prosperity	The title and the cover design of this book are extremely attractive. So are the introductory chapters that start with the description of the hypothesis based on the title. This evokes further interest and the soon we find ourselves reading topics that are a rare combination of economics, literature and culture.  <br /> <br />There are examples of people in different continents whose income levels in dollar terms vary astronomically. Those who live in poor countries earn less despite good academic qualifications while even a not so educated farm worker in a rich country like Sweden is paid  handsomely. The book attempts to solve this mystery.  <br /> <br />There are only nineteen countries with a combined population of about 1 billion that are \\"rich\\". These countries spring back to prosperity within a short time even when they are flattened by bombs - Germany and Japan for example. It is interesting to note that these nineteen countries have many similarities - statistically atleast - in terms of economic policy, honesty of people, climate, etc. Switzerland tops this list. These \\"rich\\" countries are not dependent on their natural resources and have significant trade in value added products and services between them. The rest of the world is just not able to catch up. ( Even the oil kingdoms do not appear in the list of rich in terms of per capita GDP). The book goes on to explain that it is disciplined pluralism with a combination of economic, social and political institutions  that is responsible for such success. <br /> <br /> <br />Let us then look at the \\"poor\\". Pakistan for example has nuclear weapons capability, but a weak public health care system. Can a nation boast of technology when people die from disease ?. This discussion goes on. The next logical step for poor countries would be to exactly replicate the policies of the rich as a quick and sure road to prosperity. Here the author feels that the process needs to evolve over long periods and cannot be transplanted. This is perhaps a very controversial view and can generate a healthy debate.  <br /> <br />There are several chapters meant to explain the concepts stated in the hypothesis on prosperity. The bulk of these are devoted to economics while politics and social systems do appear with some icing of art and literature. One might be tempted to visit France and also develop an interest in paintings, Van Gogh, to be specific.  <br /> <br />I found every chapter very interesting particularly in the style and simplicity of explaining complex economic issues without the aid of mathematical tools - free markets, perfect competition, economic rent, consumer surplus, central planning, monopolies, and a host of other key topics of economics and wealth generation. Economics is treated as a subject of allocating scarce resources among competing ends. Nobel laureates in economics are quoted liberally adding to the richness of the discussion. The glossary of economic terms provides a good reference. <br /> <br />Having enjoyed the reading on various economic concepts and issues, finally there appears to be a disconnect between from where we started and how the book concludes. Despite this shortcoming the book can be considered a great collection of ideas on a very important global issue.	2004-08-19

But then conventionally the unit of analysis was the country. Not anymore, if we need to prosper as citizens of the global village. This theme is at the core of this book and sets it apart from most others who are not so broadminded in accepting this fact.  <br /> <br />Coming to deflation, the author takes us through a well documented journey of over two centuries, two world wars and  two big economic traumas of the twentieth century - the great deflation of the 1930s and the great inflation of the 1970s. He challenges the conventional view that deflation is inherently bad for the economy and on the contrary cites several decades of prosperity during periods of mild deflation. The very fact that most elected governments would like to hold the price line protecting consumers and investors, they need to put in place mechanisms with a deflationary bias. With this change in perspective about deflation, the author explains the main trends in the 1990s that are inherently deflationary. Globalization and the internet have strengthened global supply chains for products and services giving the consumer information, choice and control over her purchasing decisions. Rapid increase in productivity since 1995 ( to 3.5 % from an average of 1.4 %) due to technological advances is a fundamental force on downward prices. The rise of discount retailing giants like Wal-Mart is another factor. Thus, instead of branding deflation as a dreaded monster that will close down plants and spread misery, it should be managed in proportions that will improve competitiveness, increase availability and market efficiencies. Supply side economics rather than shrinkage in demand should be the driver of price determination.  <br /> <br />One concept that very well emerges from this book is that both inflation and deflation in large proportions for prolonged periods are bad. The responsibility of the Fed to intervene at the right time with appropriate therapies is well explained. Deflation like inflation is a stimulant if administered in the right doses. <br /> <br />Two sectors that come up for criticism are Health Care and Education. These sectors are yet to exploit efficiencies of technologies and improvement in processes adopted in most other manufacturing and service sectors. Hence affordable healthcare and education that can impart substantial improvement to the quality of human capital are still proving elusive. <br /> <br />There is a chapter devoted to investment choices and strategies available to individuals should there be a prolonged phase of deflation. <br /> <br />This book explains some excellent concepts through a non jargon approach. Those who have not had formal college education in economics will also find it interesting. A table with the chronological listing of key economic events discussed in various chapters for ready reference would be very helpful.	2004-08-02

Starting with a historical perspective, the author goes on to explain that it has never been easy to make money in a market that otherwise appears so attractive due to its sheer size in terms of its population. Multinationals have made over optimistic estimates of the potential market size for various goods and services and sunk  billions of dollars either in the hope of making a quick profit or with a view to stay invested before rivals can enter. In most cases, returns have proved elusive.  <br /> <br />China is a land shrouded in mystery and secrecy but yet continues to entice entrepreneurs from around the globe. The mad rush to grab the proverbial pots of gold turns into a frenzy in the early 1990s. China becomes the main destination for the global leaders and captains of multinational companies. Having brought in their money, these investors soon find themselves  trapped in a situation of no return. Those with deep pockets manage to survive while many others are not so fortunate. The asset inflation boom - stocks and real estate- also has its fair share of victims. Another area discussed in detail is the weakness of Chinese financial institutions and the proportion of non performing assets that account for nearly half of their lending particularly to state owned enterprises. While exports is a success story appreciated across the world, here again the author is quick to point out the low value addition and low share in global trade. <br /> <br />Page after page, the author misses no opportunity to criticise the Chinese bureaucracy, political system the authoritarian rule of the party depicting china as a land that is on the verge of a great economic meltdown where global corporations will have no escape route to retreat.  <br /> <br />It is important to note that global companies have gone to do business in China and it is their love for money and not charity has beenthe motive. It is said that greed, optimism and herd mentality are the three drivers of  capitalism . Need a better example ? Large multinationals, mostly from developed countries boast of employing the best talent from leading business schools who are experts in market research and financial accounting. When things go wrong, why blame it on China?. There is no evidence in the book that suggests that China has misused money from international institutions or indulged in unfair practices to swindle FDIs. Assuming that China overstated her domestic income and growth figures, the two main parameters that have attracted the foreign capital, it cannot be an excuse for not doing enough home work to verify these figures before investing huge amounts.  <br /> <br />The book appears to be biased and incomplete in not giving due credit to the rapid progress and achievements of the world's most populous nation.	2004-07-28

What sets this book apart is the approach to the topic through the route of financial history, sociology and of course a good grasp of macro-economics. History, the authors argue, has taught us many lessons, only to be quickly forgotten. Two important lessons from the past are that paper money cannot make paupers rich and empire building through military might has ultimately brought misery to mankind. However, nations have consistently repeated these mistakes and lamented when it was too late. No prizes for guessing who the latest adventurer is. <br />This book is a brilliant expose of the \\"new economy\\", the irrational behavior of crowds and its malaise of overvalued stock and asset prices that cannot be sustained. Even the Nobel prize winning theory of efficient markets fails to describe the phenomenon in US markets during the last decade of the twentieth century. Irrational exuberance cannot be explained by rational theories. The book opens with an analysis of the new economy driven by Information technology, and blasts the myth of the new found prosperity. The new economy was supposed to signal the end of history by shortsighted economists during the days of irrational exuberance. The internet in fact amplified the behavior of crowds across continents and created bubbles that were larger than ever. Companies without any revenue, leave alone profits, were busy making money through IPOs and engaged in the most innovative forms of financial engineering to drive their stock prices north. Who cares as long as it makes us rich. But then, history has taught us that reality will catch up and so it did. <br />There was a time in the seventeenth century when the infamous John Law ( he was mostly on the opposite side of his second name) created the concept of paper money and central banking that ultimately brought his country on its knees. Using this example, the book attacks monetarists for the unbridled  expansion of liquidity in a system that temporarily believes that paper money is real. Modern day economists tend to treat the economy as a machine that can be manipulated by driving some screws and made to run a little faster. The problem , the authors feel, is that soon they will be left with no screws and also run the risk of tampering with the wrong ones. Printing more money at regular intervals, is considered a panacea for all economic ills by these pundits of prosperity. <br />Economic lessons from Japan are described in a separate chapter and quoted in most other chapters of the book. The chapter devoted to \\"The Hard Math of Demography\\" is excellent and the topic of an aging America and its economic implications is discussed with accurate statistics and analysis to back the conclusions.<br />Finally one gets the big picture of the big bubble. Americans are spending and the Fed is encouraging them to spend borrowed money. To make things easier, the interest raters are lowered and more money is printed. Savings rates in the US have reached an all time low close to zero while private sector debt is three times the GDP. US is now the biggest borrower and foreigners till now have believed that the paper money printed by Fed is a safe currency. This illusion may not continue. The party will soon be over, and a massive hangover is imminent. Currency that is not backed by gold or equivalent assets is nothing but what it is made of - paper. History tells us that forbearance and thrift and not profligacy lead to prosperity.<br />Text books on history a few decades from now will probably carry a chapter on what went wrong with the worlds' once most powerful nation.	2004-07-19

But as rightly pointed out by Mr. Chakravorti, these studies are successful in nurturing innovations and bringing them till the gates of organizations. Many of the innovations despite being far superior solutions from powerful multinationals, fail in the market place. In other words, technological or product superiority and even the sheer muscle of giant corporations is not sufficient to ensure that these innovations are accepted by customers. <br />This book looks at the market as a network of players with dependencies and in equilibrium. Some entities in this network act as nodes and are the main players. Networks prefer equilibrium and it requires a good understanding of what it takes to shift this equilibrium to a new state. This is where the concept of game theory is extensively used and demonstrated through excellent case studies - Communications, Automobile Industry Supply Chains and Software are some examples. \\"Think Equilibrium\\" is the key message.<br />The best part of the book is that it simplifies complexity of theoretical aspects and delivers important concepts and a framework for application by managers. The other book that I enjoyed equally on the topic of game theory in business is \\"Co-opetition\\"  by Barry Nalebuff and Adam Brandenburger. \\"How Breakthroughs happen\\" by Andrew Hargadon and \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" by Clayton Christensen will be excellent supplements if we need to trace the complete trajectory of innovation from the lab to the customer's lap. <br />This book is a classic. If game theory owes a lot to \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", successful innovations in future will thank this beautiful book.	2004-06-09

The fact that this book focuses so much on the human aspect, and argues in every chapter on the beneficial aspects of Globalization, it appears that the author is on a special assignment from some International agency. While I am not an opponent of Globalization ( even after reading Prof Stiglitz's \\"Globalization and its discontents \\"- an authoritative report on the darker side of the story), this book by Prof Bhagwati did not impress me since it appears to be highly one sided and rhetorical, that lacks the backing of sound economic evidence. The style, with a rich dose of English literature, is political, bordering on an election campaign, and not a book of substance from a professor of Economics.<br />However, the best part of the book is that it has helped improve my vocabulary, despite Shakespearean distractions( My copy of the Webster's dictionary was put to good use after a long time). I have absolutely no doubts on the integrity, experience and the academic brilliance of the author. The book devotes one chapter each for discussing important issues ranging from women's rights, child labor, democracy, wages , environment and this makes it a comprehensive coverage of the topic hardly seen in many other books. But most of the arguments are not supported by sufficient data and analysis as one would expect in order to accept the hypothesis of the cases. No doubt, this book has a long list of notes and references from which the author has generously quoted, but again, I was at times a little lost in the maze of quotations.  <br />Despite these shortcomings, the core topic of this book ( globalization with a human face) is bound to be at the forefront of policy formation in most developing countries and also influence discussions and decisions at global institutions like the WTO, IMF and the World Bank. If that happens, the book deserves substantial credit. <br />Globalization is not a problem, but a part of the solution to usher in an era of prosperity on a global scale with a human face. I have no disputes with the author on this statement.	2004-05-25

But the age of oil, the world's largest commodity, is likely to end, thanks to its limited supplies. Many books have been published about the impending oil crisis that is likely to hit us within the next decade. Implications of the excessive use of fossil fuels, its impact on the environment and our health is also another important topic. Economies dependant on oil will find it hard to cope with the skyrocketing oil prices if King Hubbert's theory and forecast that our demand has already exceeded what the global reserves can supply, happens during this decade. The crisis occurs not when the last drop of oil has been pumped out, but when we have crossed the half way mark in exhausting the supplies. Another unfortunate dimension to this situation is the fact that most of the remaining known reserves lie in not so politically stable countries, not to talk of the religious divide. Some of these countries have suddenly increased their estimates of reserves. The authors feel that is due to OPEC's quota fixing formula and some countries have overstated their reserves to get a higher quota of production. Lies, damn lies and statistics and perhaps we can add middle east oil reserve estimates to this list.<br />The next decade, the authors forecast, will be a decade of oil at $ 100+ a barrel. Turbulent times await us, economically. The book discusses the impact of rising oil prices on the economy, a brief overview of alternate and supplementary energy sources along with steps for conservation. It also takes into account the various macro economic realities like today's housing boom, expansion in consumer credit, low interest rates and employment scenario. Many other books have ended here. But Stephen and Donna Leeb steer us clear through turbulent times, helping us understand the economic impact and harness the forces beneficially through prudent investment decisions. Two things come to my mind whilelooking at this approach. The forces of nature were never conquered, but utilized by mankind beneficially by harnessing them instead of attempting to change or fight them. Secondly , our success in various fields was possible due to simplification of complex phenomena into elegant theories. This book is a winner on both these counts. <br />The Oil Indicator described in simple terms by the authors, if successful, will be acknowledged as one of the most important principles in financial and portfolio management by the middle of the next decade.<br />The book also contains a suggestive portfolio of investments and the share of each segment depending on what the oil indicator suggests periodically. Keep shuffling the mix, to maximize gains instead of the conventional buy and hold strategy suggest the authors. Their industry analysis and choice of stocks is interesting, though at times I felt that it lacks depth. But the authors, given their background, can be safely given the benefit of doubt of having done the detailed analysis and given us only the results.<br />A word of caution. This book is about the American Economy and investment options available in that country as recommended by the sign of the Oil Indicator. Readers like me from other countries may have to suitably tailor the analysis and recommendations as per local economic situations. <br />In the preface the authors hope that this book would be provocative, informative and helpful. Mission accomplished.	2004-04-21

The first chapter starts off well. The forecast (in 1950's) of Shell Oil Company geophysicist M. King Hubbert that rate of oil that would be extracted from oil wells would peak around 1970 and decline thereafter is well narrated. Thereafter the author gets into basics of energy, entropy and engines which at best could be an introduction on the subject for high school students. <br />The various sources of energy, the issues of global warming, waste disposal, cost and feasibility are explained well, but again lack the depth that one would expect from serious reading on these topics.<br />However I would certainly recommend this book to all those who would like to have an overview of the current and future energy sources, but lack formal education in science and engineering. <br />It would be appropriate to rename the book - \\"Energy, Engines and Environment - An Introduction\\"	2004-04-14

Walls have tumbled and so have the barriers to trade. But in the process of creating a global economy that has seen rapid growth in global trade in the last three decades, have we committed any major blunders, atleast in economic terms ?. The answer seems to be an affirmative YES according to the author. During the days till the First World War, gold was the only currency that was acceptable across international borders. While the war led to the departure from this standard, paper currency flooded European markets, leading ultimately to the great depression of the 1930?s. This was our first concrete lesson to realize that money, cannot be created out of thin air, for that matter even out of plain paper.    Bretton Woods restored the relationship between currency and gold and thereby linked exchange rates. The author explains how a country with  trade deficit had to part with gold which in turn led to shrinkage of credit, increase in lending rates, fall in consumption and ultimately the restoration of trade balance. Gold clearly played the role of being the conscience keeper in international markets. A noble metal indeed.     With gold standard, everything was working fine and global accounts were  balanced. Suddenly Uncle Sam with his insatiable need for foreign goods, thanks to the growing consumer demand at home and increasing military expenditures in his self proclaimed capacity to police the rest of the world, goes on a spending (and borrowing ) spree.  The greenback is no longer exchangeable with gold, but in fact would have to be treated to be of value in itself. The rest is history as so well explained in this book. This book devotes atleast a third of its space for graphs, charts and tables taken from published international sources to support the arguments in every chapter.    What follows the departure from the gold standard is the generation of a huge US trade deficit with its trading partners over the last three decades. This deficit is paid alteast in terms of accounting, in Dollars that are not backed by gold. This paper money creates the following :    - Increase in investments in manufacturing capacities by multinationals in low wage countries  - Increase in capacities creates fall in prices of manufactured goods  - Fall in prices leads to higher purchases by Americans  - Higher consumer spending on foreign goods leads to increase in trade deficit  - US  trade deficits lead to more Dollars with trading partners  - Trading partners experience asset appreciation in their countries  - Investments by trading partners in US leads to asset/housing/stock market appreciation.    Till here it is fine. It is like the first couple of drinks at the party and everybody is enjoying. But then it does not stop there, unfortunately. The drinks keep pouring in and the music turns to noise. The party soon becomes a nuisance to society. In the above sequence, the asset appreciation leads to asset bubbles and over investments leads to deflationary pressures. This leads to fall in corporate profitability which is followed by the collapse of stock markets and banks. Banks collapse and soon the party is over. The hangover unfortunately lasts longer than the duration of the party. Tigers soon become kittens as we saw in the second half of the last decade in Asia. And the kittens are too drunk even to move.     This book presents a very powerful case to argue that America will not be able to continue its trade deficits and that the global economy is on the  verge of a collapse thanks to the overvalued Dollar. Overvalued by how much ? 50 % by one estimate. When will the dollar collapse ? Anytime from yesterday.     Consequences to various trading partners from Asian Economies including Japan, Latin America to the European Union is well analyzed. China will be the worst hit with its banks already facing up to 50 % non performing loans. Europe seems to be the safest, atleast relatively.    Any rescue package? . Certainly, says the author who advocates a demand side stimulation of the global economy through increase in wages ( in export oriented companies in developing countries) over a ten year period, which would not hurt multinationals since daily wages are too low at $ 4 in countries like China and we can afford to take it to $14 by 2014. With Multiplier Effect, the author explains that this will lead to surge in demand to offset the slump in US Consumption. There is also the need for a Global Central Bank to restore normalcy in international currency standards. Monetarism will fail since we are on the verge of a liquidity trap with near zero interest rates as experienced in Japan.    It helped me to brush up my understanding of Macroeconomics and it is advisable to do so before reading this book. What has happened till date is supported by facts. What is likely to happen is frightening. Can I have a drink please ?	2004-04-12

Competition is getting tougher and customers are more difficult to please. On the other hand everything is connected, objects are embedded with sensors and software and information flows instantly to all corners of the world , thanks to the communications revolution. This book essentially looks at a networked world where customers and companies are inseparable and are constantly in interaction. In this paradigm, the framework of DART - Dialogue, Access, Risk Assessment and Transparency is introduced and the book proceeds to explain each of these in detail. <br />The word Co-creation will get included in your daily vocabulary sooner than you expect. Lots of diagrams and case studies are thrown into every chapter. But frankly, there is no concept that is radically different from some of the pioneering works on similar topics already published.  To list a few :<br />-Customer.Com by Particia Seybold<BR>-How to Grow when Markets Don't by Adrian Slywotzky<BR>-The Innovator's solution by Clayton Christensen<BR>-Adapt or Die : Turning your Supply Chain into an Adaptive Business Network by  Bob Betts , Claus Heinrich<BR>-Experimentation Matters: Unlocking the Potential of New Technologies for Innovation by Stephen Thomke <BR>-Priceless: Turning Ordinary Products into Extraordinary Experiences by Diana Lasalle, Terry A. Britton <BR>-The Agenda: What Every Business must do to Dominate the Decade by Michael Hammer<br />Most of the case studies in this book are repetitions from these or are similar in concepts or processes in creating value for ( or along with) the customer.  The authors have duly acknowledged and referred to an elaborate list of books and articles under \\"Aids to Exploration\\". But my point is that after going through some of the key works listed above, this book fails to impress on originality. <br />Towards the end of the book, Knowledge Management is brought in as one of the strategic tools that can be integrated into the co-creation framework. <br />It is certainly interesting to go through the book though it is a combination of old ideas in a new packaging. Young MBAs will find lots of new jargon that can be put to profitable use in job interviews.	2004-03-31

The world has significantly changed since then and so have the fortunes of many of the \\"excellent\\" companies listed in this book. Some have continued to excel, some have made a comeback after facing tough times and some have ceased to exist. Excellence is neither permanent nor an assurance for \\"lived happily thereafter\\" ending for a corporate fable. As often mentioned in most management books, the only thing that is permanent is change, and change has been rapid and unforgiving in the last two decades. In this context, is this one time business bestseller flawed in its study and its findings ?. The authors themselves answer this question in their opening remarks - \\"Authors' Note: Excellence 2003\\" in this new paperback edition.<br />Theory first. There is a solid attack on the Rational Model ( over emphasis on  quantitative approaches to management )  in American business schools which the authors feel is a main cause for the decline of American companies in the third quarter of the twentieth century. The understanding of the human side and aligning people with the Organization's goals through a deep sense of respect and involvement is at the core of success at the excellent companies is the next hypothesis. In their search for excellence, the research leads to eight prominent attributes that are common across the best run companies. All these attributes have direct and significant link to this aspect of the human side of enterprise.<br />The excellent companies have focussed consciously and consistently on rigorously practicing several of the eight attributes. Failure to focus on these have led to setbacks in subsequent years. An outstanding athlete cannot be expected to win gold at all the Olympics in his lifetime. Athletes age and so do companies say the authors. But is there a prescription against aging for companies that are committed to excellence ?<br />This book is liable for criticism on the following counts :<br />- Too much of theory in the first four chapters, mostly borrowed from other earlier management gurus<BR>- Descriptive and repetitive<BR>- Data insufficiency for backing conclusions<BR>- Sample does not cover all industries and restricted to American companies<BR>- Talks of the past and ignores prescriptions for the future<BR>- Attributes need to be ranked and revisited periodically and perhaps a new list might emerge<br />Several books have been written on this topic since this classic was first published in 1982.  Many have addressed the points listed above. But this ground breaking book continues to be the pathfinder in all that has followed. Go back to the analogy of the athlete. A gold is a gold at any contest and this book deserves one for its own excellence.	2004-03-18

During the mid 70's, as a school kid, I remember the big campaign launched by oil companies in India -\\" Save that drop of oil, or walk to your destination 20 years from now\\". Thanks to the crisis in the middle-east, the rest of the world was starving for oil. Economies slowed down, inflation rose and unemployment hurt. One commodity that we rely on to drive down to our destinations, whose availability is unfortunately skewed could virtually halt the rest of the world. OPEC continues to control the valve through which most of the world's oil flows. This is a political issue that affects economies globally.<br />If we assume that oil is abundantly available, then we are faced the problem of the resulting pollution and global warming that our machines create. We then need to think of an alternate energy source that is free from political and environmental sensitivities.<br />This book is an excellent analysis of the global energy scene from the perspectives of deregulation, environmental issues and the research on new technologies that are capable of providing cheap, clean and reliable sources of energy.<br />Vijay has brought to the table his extensive and in-depth knowledge of the subject and also the views of key people in the field. The book has been divided into logical chapters and each one is a topic of discussion by itself. His comparison of energy sources, consumption patterns and technology access across the developed and the developing worlds is superb. The rich nations have a role and an obligation to help the poorer nations to access nonpolluting technologies. At many places the book provides the latest figures on pollution rates, energy consumption and economic indicators that support the analysis.<br />Hydrogen is the winner in the race and search for the fuel of the future. If the internet connects millions of computes that share information, soon we will have an energy internet that shares andtrades clean energy. Maybe, energy might become even free. After all hydrogen is abundantly available on earth.<br />Fuel cells seem to be emerging as a disruptive technology. Imagine devices like laptops, palmtops and mobile phones powered by small fuel cells that can be run on alcohol. Just give them a small drink and they will keep running for days.  <br />I  am looking for a sign that will assure our children - \\"Twenty years from now, your cars will need only water to drive you to your destinations\\"<br />A must read for all who care for energy, environment and economics.	2004-02-22

The concept of defining technology as an arrangement of Objects (hardware and software, tangible and unchanging), Ideas (understanding how to interact with objects) and  People (those who know these objects and ideas) lays the foundation for the research. Innovation is a result of (Objects + People + Ideas) recombined in new ways.Innovations that happen this way are cheaper, quicker and are more likely to succeed. The social side of innovation as a process bridging distant worlds and building new communities is the most valuable contribution of this book. The author uses theories of sociology very effectively to further exploit this phenomenon. <br />Definition of networks and their relevance to the process of innovation is another important concept.\\" Man is suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun\\" - Max Weber. Networks link distant social groups and their relationships. Breakthrough Innovations  cause a dramatic shift in these networks according to the author. Case studies are liberally used to explain each concept. If  Edison was an innovator he was actually great networker transforming the Menlo Park Laboratory of 15 engineers into a factory for patents. If Ford at Highland Park pioneered the assembly line for magnetos and then cars, it should also thank the meat packaging industry among others for  the origination of these ideas. <br />If innovation is a recombination of objects, people and ideas in new ways, it is possible for firms having access to different industries to be the leaders in innovation. Design Continuum's contribution to Reebok pump athletic shoe came from  its experience in the pharma industry. This firm with just 110 people is a place for combination of ideas in a systematic manner. \\" We enjoy working in diverse industries and it brings great benefit to our clients\\" - Gian Zaccai, CEO of Design Continuum.<br />The Concept of \\"Technology Brokering\\" to create new relationships is the key lesson for managers to practice. Managers in  today's global businesses should see innovation as an integral part of business strategy. Taking this responsibility for innovation as a process, they should then promote networking to connect diverse product divisions across countries, encourage people to work in new areas, attract and retain people from diverse industries, and accept innovation as a social process rather than merely pumping money into laboratories that work in isolation. Innovation should happen by design and not by accident.<br />This book is very different from most other books on innovation and introduces a new paradigm that we cannot afford to ignore.	2004-02-06

One is a first year MBA student and another a senior executive in a large multinational. Without hesitation, I recommended this book.<br />Strategy has been a subject matter of interest to Business and Military than to any other profession. In both these cases it is a about doing something differently to gain advantage over the adversary either in the battlefield or in the marketplace. Strategy is not just a piece of paper or a corporate manual but a state of the mind to win against all odds. So many books and theories have been written on this subject and still it continues to be a topic that cannot  be defined as an exact science. If there is one topic that can be listed as the most important for any MBA program, undoubtedly it is Business Strategy.<br />Another reason for revisiting this book is that in the last decade, we have been overloaded with  concepts of  digitization and technology as the main drivers of business. We have seen technologies that are excellent but have failed miserably in the marketplace. Technocrats have failed to convert bits and bytes into bucks. In the quest for technical excellence, strategy has taken a back seat. We need to fill this vacuum of strategic thinking.<br />But then the problem is to have a strategy to understand and apply this vital topic ! It is here that this book is one among the best I have come across till date.<br />Strategy is a combination of elastic thinking and application of analytical method. Omahe explains this well and warns that strategy is not just somebody's spark of genius but a process that needs rigorous effort and  continuos refinement. He brings in the framework of listing the concrete phenomena, grouping, abstraction and determination of approach that are actionable and practical. The three Cs' of the strategic triangle - Corporation, Customer and Competitor are at the core of this book. Each C is discussed in detail with excellent illustrations and case studies.<br />If you need to  read an executive summary, I recommend Chapter 7 - The Secret of Strategic Vision. In this chapter one paragraph in my opinion contains the essence of strategic thinking.<br />\\"Strategic thinking in business must break out of the limited scope of vision that entraps deer on the highway. It must be backed by the daily use of imagination and by constant training in logical thought process. Success must be summoned; it will not come unbidden and unplanned. Top management and its corporate planners cannot base their day-to-day work on blind optimism and apply strategic thinking only when confronted by unexpected obstacles. They must develop the habit of thinking strategically, and must do it as a matter of course. Ideally, they must approach it with real enthusiasm as a stimulating mental exercise.\\"<br />The book was first published in 1982. Hence some of the assumptions on key economic trends under \\"Modern Strategic Realities\\" have undergone major corrections. However, the framework for strategic thinking still holds good. Though the examples are mostly from Japanese companies, Omahe concludes the book by pointing out that \\" Creativity, mental productivity and the power of strategic insight know no national boundaries. Fortunately for all of us, they are universal.\\"is discussed in detail with excellent illustrations and case studies. <br />If you need to  read an executive summary, I recommend Chapter 7 - The Secret of Strategic Vision.

In the madness for tech stocks where millions rushed in to make a fast buck, as is the case with all such crazy manias starting with the legendary tulips , billions of dollars were generated out of thin air, virtually, and in the most  recent decade , perhaps digitally. Suddenly, reality strikes, gravity starts acting and the rest is history. Sadly, history repeats itself.<br />This book is the story of AOL using virtual money to buy real assets. If the real story is interesting, Nina Munk has made it exciting.  Grass on the other side is greener, the old saying goes. AOL wanted something real to latch on in its digital world while Time Warner was craving for digitization. A merger, would be a perfect marriage,  as it appeared to the CEOs of the two companies. Three years since then, over $ 200 billion   of stock valuations  have evaporated back into where they belong - cyberspace.  It is said that greed, optimism and herd mentality are the three drivers of  capitalism . Need a better example ?<br />A repetition of these obvious facts is not what makes this book a good read. Nina Munk has diligently tracked the business histories of the companies involved,  listed the key players and their biographies and then integrated this background into the main story of the merger and its problems.<br />Easy to read, and light on technical aspects. At the end, I personally feel that Time Warner in its new form has the capacity to come back. After all it is this true spirit of free enterprise that keeps America going. When the going gets tough, the tough get going.	2004-01-08

This book is an easy to use toolkit for performing this effectively.<br />The framework ( if I can use the word) for generating buy-in, is simple and powerful. Having determined the buy-in objective, it is important to establish a strategic story line. Humans think in pictures and images, and it is an appealing story that can capture attention about the vision and a positive future. The next step is to have three targeted chapters (based on the theory of Trilogy of  Persuasion) , each directed at fulfilling the audience's future needs, wants and goals. Here the leader aligns his goals with that of the audience. Each targeted chapter is followed by supporting evidence to substantiate the statements in the targeted chapters. Buy-in is almost complete at this stage and now is the opportunity to call for action.<br />Each of these steps is clearly explained through very relevant examples. Excerpts from President George W. Bush's address to a joint session of Congress , September 20, 2001( to rally the nation in the wake of September 11 attacks), structured on this framework , is the best take away from this book.<br />A chapter at the end of the book is devoted to some FAQ's on the language of buy-in. <br />This is not a book that discusses theories of leadership and communication, but a practical guide for achieving results.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-02

You have three options - accept it, reject it or shape it. The author suggests the third option.<br />With the demise of communism in the last decade of the twentieth century, capitalism is the only  remaining vehicle of economic development that appears to have succeeded in creating prosperity in the developed world. Globalization in the context of the third industrial revolution led by knowledge based industries is the spread of capitalism across boundaries. Capitalism has three basic traits as outlined by the author - greed, optimism and herd mentality. It is this combination that drives capitalists to establish global supply chains - produce where it is cheap and sell where it is attractive; and everyone has something to sell.  Globalization is driven by businesses and not by national governments. While governments can play a catalytic role in attracting businesses, it is business that fuels the engine of growth.<br />The distribution income and wealth has never been so skewed in the history of mankind. While just a couple of hundred years ago the per capita incomes across nations was almost uniform, and perhaps uniformly low, today the top 20 percent of the nations control 80 percent of the planet's wealth, and this disparity is increasing. While America with over 32 percent of global GDP in dollar terms is the locomotive of global growth, the author emphasizes the urgent need to kick start two other big locomotives- Europe and Japan, that can pull the global economy faster into prosperity. The American locomotive is now struggling with a huge trade deficit and a overvalued dollar. It can stop. Europe and Japan are shut. It is this scenario of no locomotive in action that threatens to bring global economies to a halt, and into a recession. The third world countries will be hit hard should this happen.<br />There are conflicting interests between the developed world and developing countries when it comes to some vital issues on global prosperity. Capitalism aims at rewarding intellectual properties, and there is no limit to such rewards. Capitalism ignores human aspects. On the other hand there are billions of poor people in developing countries for whom a square meal a day is a luxury. They just cannot afford health care and drugs at international prices. Governments in these countries need to find a way for providing health care though it may not satisfy the prices demanded by global pharmaceutical companies. Intellectual property is important but human life is priceless. Similarly when it comes to agriculture, developed nations protect and subsidize their farmers, which denies a huge opportunity for developing countries to export their production and earn higher incomes.<br />Singapore and Taiwan receive accolades as models of globalization and growth in Asia. The picture on china is mixed. Growth statistics projected by China are shown as suspect in accuracy and bordering on intentional exaggeration. Despite attracting huge FDIs, China has inherent weaknesses in her banking system and continued government support to inefficient State Owned Enterprises weakens it further. Growth is confined to certain pockets and has not reached large provinces in the interior. China's bet on an export led economy is also not sustainable according to the author. <br />The IMF and the World Bank are heavily criticized for their outdated policies. The author is in agreement with some observations by Prof. Joseph Stiglitz in his book \\" Globalization and Its Discontents\\" on this aspect.<br />The chapter on the role of a Chief Knowledge Officer for companies and governments is not convincing and there appears to be a lack of continuity with other chapters. Strategic planning in the perspective of a global economy based on knowledge assets is of course very clear, but strategies for managing  knowledge in that scenario is a huge topic by itself. <br />The book starts by drawing an analogy between globalization and the construction of the tower of Babel. According to mythology, the Lord came down, saw the tower and decided to scatter the men who built the tower across the globe and confused the languages of all the earth so that they may not understand each others speech. Hope this time the Lord is pleased by the new tower and shall bless humanity with all prosperity into posterity. This is the tower of the twenty first century. <br />This book is a call upon all nations to join in this exciting journey. There is no guarantee for success. \\" Those who leap sometimes lose, but those who do not leap always lose. Fortune favors the bold.\\"	2003-12-31

US	50954482	R2BL5HZ3PETRA4	1578517508	800637480	Experimentation Matters: Unlocking the Potential of New Technologies for Innovation	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Innovation redefined	Observation, exploration and experimentation have been the three basic means of learning for scientists. Of these, experimentation calls for the highest levels of external intervention and as a topic by itself has always been of interest to statisticians who have developed powerful techniques to derive maximum information through the least possible number of experiments. Application of these statistical techniques has resulted in substantial reduction in research expenditure, quicker understanding of  scientific principles and  shorter time to convert ideas into useful products. On the other hand new technologies like simulation, CAD/CAE that harness the advances in computing have completely changed the experimental landscape by providing powerful techniques for rapid and economical experimentation on our desktops and servers. To cite one example discussed in this book, car maker BMW's crash simulation test progressed from 3000 to 700000 finite elements between 1982 to 2002 while simultaneously resulting in reduction of processing time from 3 months to 30 hours. Power of computing enables \\"front-loaded\\" innovation - understanding the phenomenon before committing resources into physical manufacturing.<br />But the lacuna is that experimentation has never been thought as a separate management discipline cutting across functional silos to bring innovative solutions into the marketplace. Experimentation as a strategic tool that needs management attention and involvement is the core theme of this book.<br />Management deals with producing results under uncertainty. Uncertainty can be broadly classified under technical, production, market and customer needs.  Experimentation should tell us not only what will work, but also what does NOT work. The knowledge so derived should seamlessly flow across the Design-Build-Run-Analyze cycle that cuts across departmental boundaries in large organizations. This is analogous to the concept of ERP in business processes. Though this concepts looks simple, organizational barriers prevent the seamless sharing of information for innovation. Design, manufacturing , marketing and procurement functions fail to optimize on the organizational repository of knowledge that can put winning products into the marketplace. This book is an excellent study on how management can use experimentation as a unique strategy within and beyond organizational boundaries. Case studies are quite detailed and well illustrated. <br />Read this book. It is worth experimenting.	2003-11-27

Though it is advisable to read \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" before reading this book, Christensen and Raynor have brought out the fundamentals of \\"Disruptive Innovations\\" very clearly in the initial chapters, both as a refresher and reinforcement. <br />While the concept of disruptive innovation cuts across industries , the principles of harnessing the power of such disruptions are equally applicable across various disciplines of management. It is here that the book is a clear winner. It provides solution frameworks for design, manufacturing, distribution, organizing and financing of successful strategies of disruption.<br />Companies have been constantly grappling with the problem of managing and sustaining growth. Growth is the agenda point # 1 for CEOs of publicly held companies. Big companies have the capacity to attract the best talent and invest large sums of money in growth opportunities, but bigness creates the problem of \\"stalling\\" since innovations that address small markets get eliminated in the resource allocation process.  A 5 billion dollar company needs 1 billion dollars in growth while a 50 billion dollar company needs a 10 billion dollar opportunity to achieve the same rate of growth. Simple arithmetic, but a very tough situation. Consider the fact that between 1955 and 1995, of the 172 companies that were on the list of 50 biggest companies, only 5 percent were able to sustain inflation adjusted growth of 6 percent. Even across shorter time spans, the number of companies achieving double digit growth rates is in single digits. Size and success suddenly become liabilities of large companies. <br />Conventional market research techniques fail to unearth the potential for markets that do not exist. Disruptive innovations are targeted at exploiting the markets of products that are \\"good enough\\" or arecompeting against \\"non consumption\\". The concept of \\"hiring products for jobs to do\\" under the \\"categorization of circumstances\\" is bound to generate good debates on how we analyze and size market opportunities. MBA classrooms and corporate boardrooms will be intellectually challenged by this concept and its impact on the resource allocation process.<br />The authors have used the graphical framework of plotting performance trajectories and customer needs to further analyze the implications for product design and  supply chain decisions. The distinction between modular and interdependent architectures and inputs for organizational structure emerging from this framework is an example. <br />Soft issues on managerial and leadership capabilities, attitudes of investors towards profitability and growth are also discussed. <br />References at the end of each chapter themselves provide a  quick summary of some very interesting theories and findings from other researchers that have been utilized effectively in this book.<br />This book can lead to excellent research in many industry verticals. In the auto industry for example, what would be the trajectories for fuel cell and battery powered vehicles ? What strategies should car manufacturers adopt on outsourcing of components ? Where would the profits of the industry flow ? What should be the profile of managers who would be leading this transition ? <br />You have a choice to exercise. Either read this book or regret later.	2003-11-06

It begins with the hypothesis that the American auto manufacturers in Detroit are losing their competitive edge and market share to the Japanese, German and Korean imports who are merrily winning customers one car at a time. If the auto markets were to be segregated into three layers - top, middle and bottom, the Germans are at the top end, Koreans at the bottom and the Japanese entrenched in the middle are eating away each slice with ease. <br />What ails the big three ? Quality or the lack of it, incomplete understanding of customer needs and the burden of legacy costs  - at $ 1200 per car, appear to be the top three factors. <br />In the process of describing the strategies of the imports, the author gives a brief historical sketch of each company. This is certainly informative. Then she proceeds to narrate their product/market strategies to conquer the biggest auto market, from its native manufacturers. Some of the anecdotes, if I may use the term, are really entertaining. Imagine a Japanese design team travelling 27000 miles on road across America , filming customers behind the wheel. On one occasion the cops were not very kind to them.  <br />That the book is provocative and potentially controversial is quite evident from some of the reviews published till date. I enjoyed them as well.<br />The book briefly touches upon emerging technologies like Hybrids and fuel cells towards the end. In my opinion the real battle in these technologies has not yet started. Which of the new technologies are likely to be truly \\"disruptive\\" and which of the players are likely to understand and exploit their full potential holds the key to long term survival in the new paradigm, as it emerges. Extrapolation of current market shares to conclude that Toyota will be # 1 by 2010 seems premature. <br />In the context of globalization and cross country investments, the distinction between truly native and imported products is blurred. Global companies serving global markets are certain to make global customers happier behind the wheel. Fasten your seat belts please.	2003-10-29

In another better known case, a customer returned used tires to the legendary Nordstrom which accepted it politely though it had never ever sold  a tire. Fables are born when excellence captures the imagination of the customers. <br />This book  brings out what lies behind the secret of such excellence when it comes to customer service. Such service that becomes fabled comes straight from the heart of the employees. The challenge then is to hire those whose hearts are for whom they serve and to train and lead them into excellence of service delivery. <br />Through well structured illustrations from companies like SAS, Nordstrom, McDonald's, Wal-Mart, The Ritz Carlton, the message is driven straight to the heart -Make service everything your company is and does. This is accomplished through two sets of employees - those who serve the customers directly and those who serve these employees. Hiring for the right attitude and leading these men and women to excel is the \\"how\\" of the story.<br />The book mostly picks examples from retail, the philosophy and scope extends to all industries. After all, there is no business without a customer. Though all of us agree that the customer is the purpose of our business, at the top of our organization charts we never find the customer. The customer is conveniently forgotten in the organizations' most important document. Not at Nordstrom for example. Here the organization chart is an inverted pyramid with customers at the top. It takes a different mind set to accept such realities. In fact it not a state of the mind, but a matter of the heart. <br />Recommended for professionals working in today's \\"knowledge industries\\". Maybe they will gain some knowledge on what it means to serve customers!	2003-10-10

Mature markets, fierce competition, greater expectations from customers, investors and employees contribute to setting of tough growth targets and the difficulty in attaining them. It is interesting to note that only single digit (7) percentage of companies are able to achieve double digit growth in today's markets. This book takes a closer look at some of these and the means that they adopt to achieve it. <br />According to the authors, the conventional focus on product innovation, R&D and market penetration strategies have all hit a wall. To break free from this syndrome, companies have to adopt innovative approaches- Demand Innovation. Instead of focusing on the current offering, companies have to look from  a customer perspective into the entire value chain of which the current offering could be a small part. The approach is to explore the surrounding processes, products and services. <br />Cardinal Health Care is a good example with which the authors effectively start demonstrating this concept. Cardinal was struck on the periphery of wholesale drug distribution with shrinking growth and negligible margins. Cardinal soon realizes that for its customers, primarily big hospitals, procurement of drugs is just a part of the solution that seeks to reach the prescribed drugs to the patients' stomach. Suddenly a big opportunity for dispensing, accounting, re-ordering, billing and information processing of drugs in hospitals emerges. Cardinal decides to seize this opportunity. Through extended processes and acquisitions, Cardinal steps into the customers premises, providing them with end to end solutions in procurement, storage, accounting and dispensing of drugs. The concept looks simple , but the revenue streams are deep and margins healthy. A healthy prescription for growth.<br />General Motors' On Star service is another success story. Instead of just delivering a machine for transportation, GM nowassures safety, security and other value added services to the harassed drivers on the road. It is now a part of the customer throughout the product`s useful life enjoying a steady stream of revenues, with higher margins and  delighted customers. An example where communications and information technology is used to wrap value added services to an otherwise routine product delivery.<br />The book is split into logical parts and includes chapters on the role of senior managers, unlocking hidden organizational assets like customer contacts, technical expertise, process excellence and a framework to put the ideas into practice and thereby manage growth over an extended timeframe.<br />Look through the glasses of Demand Innovation and growth will appear closer and bigger. <br />Recommended reading for managers across all industries.	2003-08-28

This book is a powerful message to all Indians especially the youth. Dr Kalam's vision of a developed India, his stress on technological and scientific engines to propel us into a higher orbit in the new millennium is well known. In this book, Dr Kalam is on mission mode - to ignite the passion in the minds of our children to achieve this vision. His numerous interactions with school children, political leaders, saints, scholars and industrialists have a common theme- India can do it. <br />India is a land of cultural and religious diversity and the world's largest democracy. The challenge is to harness this diversity and channelise our energies in nation building. Great leaders of all religions seem to be in perfect agreement on this. I was moved by an example Dr Kalam has cited in this book. In the southern Indian town of Kanchipuram, there exist a mosque and a Hindu mutt side by side. When there was a move to shift the mosque further away to reduce congestion , the Hindu saint vehemently protested - \\"In fact , when at 4:30 AM the call for namaz comes from the mosque, it acts as a wake-up call for my divine duties\\". This is the message the nation needs most at this moment.<br />This book to some extent repeats from \\"Wings of Fire\\" and \\"India 2020\\". But to me it is not repetition, but reinforcement. The challenge to remove poverty by 2010 and achieve the status of a developed nation by 2020 is no simple task. This is a call to all Indians to join forces in this great mission. <br />On 30 September 2001, Dr Kalam narrowly escaped unhurt in a helicopter crash. This event seems to have had a strong impact on his mind , resulting in greater vigor and resolve to accomplish his mission . God has been kind to him and to us the citizens of India, in saving this noble man and assigning him the responsibility to the highest office of this country.<br />\\"Dream, Dream, Dream<BR>Dreams transform into thoughts<BR>And thoughts result in action.\\"<br />The time for action in NOW.	2003-08-01

Jan Carlzon calls these as moments of truth. It is these moments that largely determine the image of the airline and customer experience. Frontline employees who are responsible for this interface , meeting customers and serving them, are the ambassadors of the airline who can find a place in the hearts of the customers for their airline. With such strong beliefs driven by a organization wide movement towards customer delight, SAS turns around and soars high, Capt. Carlzon in command .<br />Leadership is responsible to create the right conditions for decisions and action by line managers, flattening the pyramid and  utilizing the vast energy released by groups of enthusiastic people. Primarily, it is people, not aircraft that matter.<br />- Consider the fact that you need to walk a mile to board the connecting flight at a transit airport. This is because aircraft have been parked by size and make at the airport hangars and not by passenger convenience. <BR>- Till the food is served, one is not sure if the special meal ordered is on board. No one either at the check-in counter or boarding gate is able to assure this in advance and provide a sense of comfort to a tired passenger far away from home.  <BR>- A mother with her infant has anxious moments till she finds a cradle on board. She would have loved to have an empty seat next to her to take better care of her loved one.<br />Not to worry when you fly SAS. SAS employees, on the ground and in the air would do everything to ensure that you have a very pleasant flight. For them &quot;Love is in the air&quot;. <br />This is just one aspect of what Carlzon has narrated, in first person in this book. If this is impressive, the rest is spectacular. <br />This book was written in the 80's and I am not sure what has happened to SAS since then. Take away from this book are moments that truly appeal toour hearts. Take care of customers and employees, who in turn will take care of the company's top line and bottom line. <br />Welcome aboard and happy reading. Love is in the air !	2003-07-29

Whatever the criticisms and the controversies surrounding the 3 magical alphabets in blue, IBM is IBM. To build such a company from ground up, offering solutions to business and scientific computing and thereby acting as the catalyst for the process of economic progress during the most part of the twentieth century is by no means an ordinary feat. That was exactly the material Thomas Watson Sr was made of. Watson has done his job and done it well and now Kevin Maney completes the rest by bringing this story in a truly remarkable manner to our bookshelves. <br />It is difficult not to fall in love with Watson Sr and his beloved company even half way through the book. From his humble beginnings to the misfortune at NCR, for nearly forty years Watson Sr is just another story of struggles, ups and downs. But to him, life just begins at forty with his job at CTR and of course the birth of Tom Watson Jr. The birth of IBM and its growth under the paternalistic care of Watson Sr through depressions, wars, booms and uncertainties gets a lion's share of coverage in this book. Watson Sr took big business risks bordering on a propensity to gamble, pushing IBM into higher orbits. Luck is the word the author takes recourse to while describing these successes. <br />The next logical part of the book deals with the succession plan at IBM that is a story by itself. Father, Son and Co by Tom Jr is widely quoted in these pages. The father's affection for his sons Tom Jr and Dick, his struggle to reconcile their differences and the frequent fights with Tom Jr are very close to what Tom Jr himself has described in his book.<br />The chapters on transformation of IBM into the era of electronics under Tom Jr and the trust suit that had a severe personal impact on Watson Sr deserve commendation.<br />While reading the pages where the old man bids goodbye to IBM and to this world, I stood up in salute to this great man.	2003-07-23

This story is around Michael the executive and his friends the minister and the professor. It clearly brings out the pressures experienced by a high-flying executive in his pursuit of success, that soon he loses his links with friends and guidance from the Lord. <br />Business leaders tend to assume themselves as masters to get things done through lesser mortals to achieve business goals. Their egos start bloating, denying them the true unconditional love bestowed on us by the Lord. EGO is aptly described here as &quot;Edging God out&quot;.<br />The leadership model as described in this book is based on Jesus and, in my opinion has not been discussed in most management books on the topic. <br />Let there be leaders....who lead as servants of the Lord.<br />Highly recommended for all men and women who would like to lead in leading.	2003-06-25

Having attained political independence from the British rule in 1947, India has much to achieve in terms of economic independence even after half a century since then. The dream to eradicate poverty and suffering in the world's largest democracy is still unrealized. India depends on imports in many areas that are crucial to her strategic interests in civilian and military applications. Large sections of the people have no recourse but to their prayers - whether it is drought or floods. Though the country boasts of its role in the global IT arena, the contribution in dollar terms is nowhere comparable to the actual potential that needs to be tapped. While there are pockets of affluence in the mini \\"silicon valleys\\" where yuppies gulp packaged mineral water, draught beer and internationally branded colas, there exist thousands of villages where clean drinking water is still a dream to our honorable citizens.<br />While this paints a grim scenario, the achievements in various sectors that have put us on the radar screen of technologically developed nations needs to be highlighted. India, a country with abundant natural resources is respected for what has been achieved in areas like self-sufficiency in food grains, a strong nuclear deterrence, a large technological and scientific work force and giant strides in our programs in the core sectors of the economy. <br />Consider this: India, a country where poverty is a thing of the past and all her citizens are healthy and educated by 2010; India, the fourth largest and developed economy by 2020. This book shows us the way. This is a mission to build on our strengths; the strength of over a billion people who are committed to succeed. It is written with an in-depth understanding of the problems on hand given the vast experience of the authors. What makes this book to stand out from the rest of the reports on similar issues is the true passion and urgency to succeed with nationalistic pride. Eachchapter deals with one important sector of growth with focus on implementation and cross-sectoral linkages. Technology for progress with a human face is a common thread across the book. All citizens, particularly the more fortunate and better educated have a major role in the road ahead. <br />As head of state, a great Indian scientist who ignites our passion is now at the helm of this mission. The country needs more Kalams and not Salaams in the North and South Blocks of New Delhi to realize this vision.	2003-06-24

There is no guarantee that smart people are honest. The best part of the book is that it comes from someone who was a part of this smart team, not so smart to reach the top, but was smart enough to be at the right places to know the whole story. Sherron Watkins not only knows the story well but also narrates it at the same pace and excitement of a fast track company. Had Enron published this book, it would have made money trading on the manuscript before it had reached the press. It would have booked a few million dollars in profit from sale of future editions using the &quot;mark to market&quot; route. Some smart executive who had thought of this brilliant idea would have walked away with a fat bonus even before the first copy of the book had left the printing press. This was Enron.<br />What started as a successful company that transported gas, ends up trading in everything it can lay its hands on. Its accounting innovations are nothing short of manipulations of elephantine proportions, carried out with blessings of the now defunct audit firm. No one bothered as long as money flowed in, into the right pockets. &quot; You can't fool all the people all the time&quot;, but this story ends when almost all the people who invested in Enron end up as fools.  This is the story of a company that once boasted of becoming &quot;The World's greatest company&quot;. Well, this is not a story.	2003-06-09

This is a paradigm shift from the expectations of a post cold war economy, and the issues facing us are more alarming and dreadful. While the terror attacks can be blamed on the enemy operating from foreign lands, the collapse of Enron followed by several prominent bankruptcy filings are the creations of perpetrators from within corporate America. Never before in history have we faced the challenge on these two dimensions simultaneously. Prof Jeffrey Garten had brought out some of the points mentioned here in his earlier book \\" The Mind of the CEO\\". He had particularly warned of the dilution of long term interests of companies when CEOs chase quarterly figures. In this book he takes stock of the role of the CEOs in the present decade, at a time when their public image has taken a severe beating and the element of trust has severely eroded. Corporate America has a major role to play in shaping the destiny of the country and the pendulum of power now seems to be swinging towards regulation, thanks to the gross misuse and betrayal of freedom of free markets in the second half of the last decade. He looks at the situation both from a historical perspective, examining the foundations of the American economy and the current reality and threats faced by the country and its corporations. The dimension of globalization, the role of developed nations in acting as a catalyst of change, development and prosperity in the developing nations is analyzed well.  The role of NGOs and the need for some new institutions to guide the policies and channel investments competing against compelling security considerations is another area of discussion. Ultimately one gets a clear \\"to do\\" list, as spelt out in the agenda points in each chapter. This applies to any CEO who cares for the well being of the nation, in addition to bothering about pleasing Wall Street and his wallet. <br />The author also admits that it would be extremely difficult for the already over worked CEO to find time to take up all these extended responsibilities. They may not have the skills either, to understand issues as diverse as foreign policy, security, global trade, economic development and social welfare.  The responsibility then shifts to Business Schools and corporate in-house executive programs to expand their curriculum to meet these challenges. The terrain is uncharted and the challenge is unprecedented, warns the author.	2003-05-19

Fortunately, this is history, about a hundred years old and this country is called The United States of America. A child attending primary school, reading this story would think that her grand parents were very close to the Stone Age. If one can comprehend the rapid changes and improvement in our life styles in the twentieth century, when we could even put a man on the moon and bring him back safely to earth, relax, the best is yet to come.<br />This book would have sounded like science fiction a decade ago and had it been published in the early half of the last century, the authors would have certainly been prosecuted for misleading the public, the fate suffered by Lee De Forest (father of the radio) in 1913, for his \\"outlandish claims\\". Today, we are on the verge of a major technological revolution that is likely to dislodge major industries in their present form. Nanotechnology, from its humble beginnings at IBM's research labs in 1989 is poised to be the next big disruptive technology invading all aspects of our life. <br />This book, after explaining the concepts of nanomanipulation is structured well to explain the possible applications, present and future and its impact on business. Nanotechnology is the true culmination and convergence of most streams of science - Agriculture, biology, chemistry, computing, physics, mathematics, medicine, and the like. At the atomic level it appears, the differences fade away. <br />Now our young friend in the primary school would add nanotechnology as an essential subject in her education, so that she would not be considered illiterate a decade from now. \\"Because in many ways nanotechnology is not just going to be he next big thing...it is going to be everything\\" concludes this book. <br />This book is also small in size.

After taking care of people who work for the organization, who in turn take care of customer delight, this book now aims at making big money both for the employee and the company. Logically this is a good sequence. The style is the same, powerful concepts explained through a parable. In Big Bucks our hero is Len who is a simple person with an ambition to make big money. <br />Expectations at the beginning of the book makes one align Len with the Area Manager (Raving Fans) or with Andy (Gung Ho!). This comparison may let you down. I should confess that Big Bucks is not a story as powerful as Gung Ho! where Andy Longclaw with the squirrels, the beavers and the geese saves Walton Works # 2. Andy still lives in our hearts. In Raving Fans, it is sheer customer delight straight from first principles applied with absolute clarity and focus, and a feeling of joy that recharges anyone to see the customer in a new perspective. Big Bucks lags behind these two great books in creating such an impact. <br />The third leg needs a bit of reinforcement. May be I will read the book again when I really decide to go after big money.

Believing the facts the first time is difficult. Digesting the contents is painful. Arthur Andersen, built on the core ethical values of the founder and named after him, decays and collapses under the shadow of the new economy. The rapid slide in the second half of the 90's within this once most respected accounting firm is unimaginable by normal standards of behavior expected of professionals in a civilized world. America has long been acclaimed as the land of opportunities. Androids have proved that it can well be a land of opportunists. The high priests of accounting standards have betrayed the public trust and presided over the liquidation of not only their own firm but several other Chapter 11 qualifiers which went under along with billions of dollars borrowed from ordinary citizens. Executive greed for quick money has made many a company bleed, with blessings from AA. If this is not crime, what else is? If Saddam Hussein has to be punished for his alleged weapons of mass destruction (that are yet to be unearthed by the mighty army), what does Uncle Sam have to say about these white collared delinquents who might continue their game in another companies in the coming years? Bad professionals like bad currency should go out of circulation. President Bush's joke on AA as quoted in this book with reference to Saddam Hussein: &quot;The good news is he is willing to let us inspect his biological and chemical warfare installations. The bad news is that he insists Arthur Andersen to do the inspection!&quot;<br />Barbara Toffler is frank enough to admit that she too did not get out of AA early since the salary was too good to risk. This book appeals to the conscience of all professionals and gives the courage to stick to ethical practices whatever the temptations and pressures to compromise on them. We are all citizens first and employees next.  <br />Sad story, but superb narration. Hope this story does not repeat itself anywhere in thefree world.	2003-04-30

Built on the core ethical and business values of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, from the humble beginnings at the garage in 1938, HP over the decades had grown up to a reputation of being one of the most admired and respected companies. The company provided an informal work environment where innovation became a way of life. Customers and employees had a strong emotional bond with this company and profits were a by-product of this long term relationship and trust. If I were to visit just one place in the United States, it would be 329, Addison Avenue. Enter 2001 and suddenly, a new CEO, a merger and a pitched battle between the Board and Walter Hewlett, the conscience keeper of the old guard.<br />Not many companies have been spared by the mass mania of the dot com and internet boom of the 90's. Unfortunately, HP has also had its share of infection. Revenue growth, aggressiveness and a sales orientation became the new mantra in the rat race for achieving higher market valuation, as perceived by the analysts on Wall Street. We have witnessed scores of CEOs falling in line with and an easy prey to this myopic quarter chasing disease, that to call it a rat race might be defamatory of rats. This book is an excellent narration of HP's sad and painful transition in this era.<br />I would not like to comment upon or take sides in the corporate battle and its outcome at HP. Today it is history and only of academic interest. The historian and the academic would know it better.  But what would be interesting is to watch the direction for the new HP from now on.   The book tends to give a feeling that the HP way is no longer relevant and the new leadership has shaken up the company and its culture. The concept of lifetime employment and entitlements for benefits is out. Compensation has been linked closely with performance and the new HP is ready to take off.

It introduces the concept of Adaptive Business Networks that consist of several firms collaborating with each other as a virtual entity, facilitated by a coordinating partner.  Each firm adjusts itself in real time to the market information, thereby winning together as a team of collaborating partners as opposed to achieving sub-optimal individual goals. The information flows from the Customer in a pre-determined manner, triggering business decisions based on uniform business processes and common technological platforms. The lead firm also retains the ability to add and drop partners depending on market forces and performance of the partners. There is no limit to the size of the network either. The partners also enjoy synergies by sharing common services - financial, consulting, legal for example. This is undoubtedly a dream of all supply chain managers. But then reality and dreams need to be bridged. This is where is book is lacking. <br />The issues that are not very convincingly answered are:<br />- How do participating firms, so diverse on their current technology platforms and business processes achieve the near standardization that is essential for such networks? Even in large multinational corporations running standard ERP software across several continents this is not yet achieved.<br />- Firms may have to participate in several networks simultaneously, and at times where the coordinating partners are fierce competitors in the same market. There would be conflicting interests where information sharing is not easy.<br />- Legal restrictions and protectionist walls across countries continue to prevail despite the rhetoric of globalization. An ideal network should first ensure a level playing ground for all players across this planet.<br />- CEO's today are afflicted by &quot;Quarteritis&quot;. Missing numbers this quarter in the &quot;larger interest&quot; of their network may not appeal to most of them in the absence of substantial benefits accruing in the immediate future.<br />- Framework for collaboration between major software vendors to provide building blocks necessary for such a network.<br />Recommended reading to understand some interesting concepts that may be of help in designing supply chain solutions.	2003-04-15

US	50954482	RDZNHRJWS2PJL	0884270629	158921357	The Race	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Necessary supplement	Business is back to usual. Tough days are here again. Organizations need to excel to be competitive in whatever they do in the race to retain customers and profits. The last decade of the last century was perhaps an exception to this rule. Now it makes sense to revisit books that show us the means to achieve excellence in operations; books written by Eliyahu Goldratt. <br />This is a book with a difference from Goldratt. The focus is on getting the concepts straight through illustrations and not in the form of a novel. <br />The goal of all businesses is to make money in the present as well as in the future. We have measurements like Net Profits, ROI, and Cash Flow to assess bottom line performance. We use the cost concept as a bridge to arrive at these measures. The book challenges the cost concept and looks at using Throughput, Inventory and Operating Expenses as the bridges that will lead us in the right direction. These terms or 'Global Operational Measures&quot; are defined in a way that is different from conventional.<br />-Throughput - The rate at which the system generates money through sales.<BR>-Inventory- All the money the system invests in purchasing things the system intends to sell.<BR>-Operating Expense- All the money the system spends in turning inventory into throughput.<br />In order to succeed in the market place, six competitive edge issues are identified - Product (Quality and Engineering), Price (Higher Margins and Lower Investment per unit), Responsiveness (Due-date Performance and Shorter quoted lead-time).<br />Having defined these measures, the book looks at the critical role of inventory (at all stages). The high inventory syndrome leads to a lower performance in all the competitive edges. The manufacturing system then should get into the mode of &quot;Synchronized Manufacturing&quot;. This is a unique combination of concepts like JIT, zero-defect and Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) approach.  In fact I found that this is the best among all of Goldratt's books to understand the DBR concept. It helps in identifying the Capacity Constraint Resources (CCRs) and balances the entire manufacturing system to towards the globally optimal solution that can achieve our overall goal.<br />The book contains some interesting exercises at the end to ensue that the concepts are well understood.<br />A must read for all managers to achieve break through improvements in operations - manufacturing and service. The race is on and is getting hotter than ever. We need to keep pace to remain in this race. The second best may not survive to have another chance.	2003-02-19

A handful of companies led by Toyota introduced concepts of Lean Manufacturing and effortlessly conquered the highways of the land of the Automobile. Japanese cars were soon seen in all continents, eating away market share from established incumbents. Low cost, high quality and fuel economy were the key differentiating factors. Several research studies were undertaken to explore and demystify the secrets behind the Japanese success. Cultural factors and traditions of Japan like strong relationships with vendors and customers, Industry alliances and a loyal work force wedded to their organization on the concept of life long employment were some of the elements that the West found hard to replicate.<br />Take \\"Keirestu' for example. This refers to the alliance between the buyers and the vendors with long relationships and cross holdings that reinforce their mutual commitment to business. This system worked well till Japan Inc fumbled. In the case of Nissan, the vendors were fleecing the already bleeding parent by charging it much higher for their parts. For Nissan, it was unthinkable to source these parts from outside Japan, since it would amount to a gross violation of the principles of \\"Keirestu\\". The master had become the prisoner. <br />Japan once boasted of the tradition of life long employment. This had gradually led to mediocrity at all levels since career advancement and compensation were linked to seniority and not performance. It was sacrilege to close down unprofitable plants and Nissan was saddled with plants running at less than 50 % capacity, hemorrhaging cash. Nissan had no money left for new product development and was forced to retain outdated models. Its customers started looking elsewhere.<br />Burdened with debt, shrinking market share, negative returns and no where to go, Nissan looks to the West for a Savior. Renault of France takes over. Carlos Ghosn, Lebanese by origin, French by education with strong experience in Brazil and North America, now heads for Japan as the chosen man from Renault. Known for his no nonsense style since his days with tire maker Michelin, he is dubbed \\" Le Cost Killer\\". <br />Ghosn's diagnoses Nissan's problems as primarily internal. He forms the now acclaimed Cross Functional Teams (CFT) drawing executives from all ranks and continents to brainstorm and recommend solutions within three months. The plan is straightforward - Nissan Revival Plan (NRP) aimed at reducing procurement costs, debt, closing plants that were not viable and introducing new models, fast. Simple, but not easy. These decisions were hitting against the very foundations of the beliefs and traditions of the Japanese Industry. Global souring challenged the \\"Keirestu\\" and decisions to sell off holdings in associate Companies to raise cash and clear debt was never done in Japan. It is precisely these aspects that make the book interesting. Ghosn not only challenges the deep-rooted traditions of Business practices in Japan, but acts with agility and speed to put the plan into action producing dramatic improvement in Nissan's bottom-line.<br />If you are looking for details on strategy in the pattern of a research study on Nissan, this is not the book. This is a simple story of a man of courage who takes charge of a sinking auto manufacturer in its homeland, steers it to safety and zooms ahead on top gear to be named Man of The Year by Automobile Magazine in 2002. From near bankruptcy to record profits would be the summary of Nissan -1999 to 2002.	2003-02-12

Hailing from the same district as that of Dr Kalam, I was personally thrilled. Rameswaram is a small sleepy island-temple town visited by thousands of pilgrims from all over India. Dr Kalam has proved to be the real deity from this holy place. Pandit Jawarharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister used to describe our modern factories and laboratories as &quot;temples of modern India&quot;. If that is so, the hero and leader of one of India's most ambitious scientific and technology programs is worthy of being the country's first citizen. And now he is!<br />Dr Kalam's career is not just that of a technologist focussed on inventions and patents. His is a mission to put India on par with the advanced technological nations of the world. He firmly believes that our respect in the International community and internal development can be achieved only through self-reliance in Technology. <br />Dr Kalam is not just a leader in Technology, by also an able leader of men. Scientists and Engineers working on leading edge technologies are essentially human beings. Leadership makes a substantial difference in bringing the best out of these brilliant minds especially when confronted with initial failures in their projects. The book has a chapter devoted to this vital aspect. Of course this is very different from rocket science.<br />Your Excellency, thank you Sir, for the simple and straight forward narration of your story that touches our hearts.

This has been the case with microeconomics, game theory, competitive strategy and many such specialized areas of research. Cartels that manipulate supply and prices are perhaps an exception to this rule. If, instead of considering the firm as the unit, we consider a group of firms teaming together to collectively provide value to the customer and succeed as a unique identity as a unit of analysis, the methodology to understand competition would undergo a paradigm shift. This book is precisely about this concept as applicable to the automobile industry.<br />In the early half of the last century it was possible to go to the countryside for a picnic in a Ford Model T car, disassemble and reassemble it with a simple wrench and drive back home in the evening. Today we need computers to diagnose even a simple problem under the hood of cars tailor made to suit individual needs. Given the increase in complexity, explosion of technology and customer preferences, it is impossible for a single firm to ever think of manufacturing even half the components. (River Rouge will be remembered in history as the most ambitious plan of an automotive giant to make all parts of the automobile - including steel and timber from within the company. At best a fairy tale for kids of the twenty first century!). <br />This book is the summary of an excellent research study of the automobile industry in the 1990's with focus on Toyota and Chrysler. These companies have significantly different \\"governance structure\\" (the proportion of parts made in-house, procured from partner firms, and from arms'-length suppliers) from their competitors- GM and Ford. The firms that have a higher proportion of parts that are bought from partner suppliers have a clear edge over competitors that use arm's-length suppliers for the same parts. Extensive data has been collected, analyzed and tested to substantiate the statements made in the text.<br />Three characteristics that distinguish between partner suppliers from arm's length suppliers- Dedicated asset investments, Knowledge sharing routines and Inter-firm trust form the virtuous triangle that make these partnerships succeed. The results of such partnerships show clearly in tangible terms - Higher profitability per vehicle, better quality, faster time to market, and more new models for customers; the key parameters that enable Toyota and Chrysler to drive at top speed. \\"It 's not the big that eat the small but it's the fast that eat the slow\\".<br />Taking lessons from Toyota, Chrysler adopts concrete programs to consolidate its suppliers, integrate and partner with them to deliver higher value at lower cost to the customer. <br />Though this research is restricted to the automobile industry, the fundamental principles of \\"extended enterprise\\" can be extended across industries.<br />Highly recommended for all managers and a must read for those working in procurement processes. Next time your supplier drops in, think of this book and start a new relationship.	2003-01-17

Scott the CEO of BGSoft is a visionary who delivers business results for his clients through his ERP software. Lenny the head of Development, Gail his marketing chief and Maggie of KPI are the other key players in this novel. <br />Like any other technology company BGSoft faces the uphill task of growing 40 % every year if it has to keep the analysts happy and retain its stock price. It is a key player in the ERP market and its customers are primarily Fortune 1000 companies who can afford the investments and fuel the growth that BGSoft is aiming at. Suddenly Scott realizes that most of the big companies have already adopted ERP and their next best bet is to look for mid size companies. If there are no more deer left in the forest then one has to go after the rabbits. Hunting for rabbits needs the same effort and results in lesser meat per win. Can BGSoff continue to grow at the same rate?<br />Now there is an unusual call from Craig, CEO of Pierco one of BGSoft's largest customers. Thanks to a new Director, his Board has asked him to justify the investment that he has made in ERP. Call it by whatever name or any flavor of the latest technology jargon, the Board wants to know the impact on two important measures - top line and bottom line. The story now takes a very interesting turn, turning away from the routine issues of features, schedules, budgets, bugs, staffing and project management that are characteristic of any ERP company. The primary issue then becomes delivering true business value that customers can get from IT solutions rather than implementing software from leading vendors on fancy technologies.<BR> <BR>Once again, it is worthwhile to mention - Top line and Bottom line - what comes in from the customers and what is retained for the shareholders. Get this right or get out of here is themessage for all CEOs. BGSoft now sees a paradigm shift - they need to sell value and not just software.<br />ERP implementations are typically seen as automating data flow across different functions in an organization. True, it enables to break walls within but sadly the rules of the game continue to remain unchanged, defeating the purpose of better information flow. Technology is necessary, but not sufficient is the core theme of this book.  <br />In the process of helping Craig to find justification for his investment in BGSoft' ERP, we get a deep inside view of Pierco's operations. Excess inventory, production bottlenecks and plenty of infighting between functions who are expected to work towards common goals. Performance measures continue to aim at locally optimal solutions ignoring the final impact on customer service. <br />Scott is quick to introduce the concepts of TOC- Drum-Buffer Rope method and Buffer management in Pierco. This releases forty percent capacity but causes an unexpected problem- plenty of inventory. TOC concept is then extended to distribution and soon across the entire operations of Pierco. Inventory is kept close to the plant and shipments to warehouses are based on replenishment of actual sales. The entire process shifts from &quot;Push&quot; to &quot;Pull&quot;. The results are dramatic. Craig is celebrating!<br />Craig calls on Scott and Maggie with a proposal to extend the solution to all his vendors and clients. Internet technologies would help. He is keen to focus on his business and not worry about software, hardware, upgrades and the hassles of the IT function. If KPI could help him, he is willing to part with half a percent of his revenues for the services to begin with and then it would jump to one percent a year. <br />Focus on results for the business, and keep the software simple. Do not allow the tendency of adding feature after feature to complicate the ERP. Extend the solution across the entire supply chain to service the end customer as one logical entity. The top line and bottom line would head north, is a very clear message from this book.	2003-01-09

It explains a very important concept - how radically new (disruptive) technologies can dislodge existing well-established (sustaining) technologies and in the process beat market leaders at their own game. First a brief explanation of the nature of disruptive technologies and how different they are from sustaining technologies. Then comes the inability of established firms to pursue these technologies due to \\"resource dependence\\". Excellent managers fail miserably when confronted by these disruptive forces. The conventional processes of being extremely customer focussed, profit driven and rational decision making for technology selection are the soft spots that eventually lead to the demise of these firms when attacked by disruptive products.<br />Disruptive technologies initially offer products that perform slightly lower on a given parameter but are typically smaller, have lower unit costs and more convenient to use. Mainstream users initially reject these products due to lower performance. Hence disruptive products soon find small niches for themselves in totally new markets (value networks) where they are appropriate for use. Due to this adoption and growth in volumes in these segments the technology trajectory begins to move upwards intersecting and invading the territory of the conventional market from below. Incumbents ignore the threat even at this stage and before they realize their folly, they are soon filing for Chapter 11. <br />Large companies ignore small markets (markets for disruptive technologies are initially small) and look for growth in established markets (markets for disruptive technologies are not initially known at all). Executives of large companies are reluctant to take on challenges in small and unknown terrain since they are always trained to \\"think big\\". <br />The hypothesis is explained very clearly using the disk drive industry (I would like to use the term \\" high clock speed\\" industry) and extended to industries as diverse as steel, escavators, retail and pharmaceuticals.<br /> The case study on automobile industry is frightening for those serving the sustaining gasoline segment. Yesterday evening I was struggling through the chaotic New Year eve traffic at 6: 30 PM in Bangalore, India to reach home early in my 1.3 liter mid segment petrol engine car. While I was virtually trapped in the chaos, I observed a cute small battery powered car navigate effortlessly through the gaps and finally was far ahead of the crowd. What next?. I decided to revisit this book.  <br />Highly recommended for managers in all industries.	2003-01-01

He does incredible things at Seaworld and his trainer Yardley, ends up learning a lot from the whale on what makes the it perform. Les Kingsley , a disgusted manager, scoring low on managing people and performance, happens to be at Seaworld; and this changes his life at office and home forever, for the better. <br />The Management Consultant Marie Anne enters the scene to give a formal academic touch to the theory behind the exemplary performance and behavior of the killer whales. Most managers respond in two ways to their reports- No response when performance is good; Negative feedback when performance is not as per expectations. There are two other ways that could make substantial difference to the lives of people and high impact on performance enhancement - Redirecting negative behavior and positive response to anything that is done in the right direction. The whole emphasis is to shift feed back from &quot; catching people doing things wrong&quot; to &quot;catching people doing things right&quot;. The focus is on establishing trust and a strong relationship with employees as a means to facilitate a channel to enhance the positive side of working towards common goals. Appreciation is given not on completion of the task to perfection, but at every effort and step that leads to it. <br />Ken Blanchard argues, as in many other works of his, against rating people as per the normal curve. He brings out a case to abolish performance management systems that compel managers to differentiate people and distribute them on a predetermined pattern. Personally, I am yet to come across substantial material and evidence to go by his argument. Managers are hired to perform, and in the process it is but natural that they would reward people who help attain business goals. This is not to say that people are to be treated as yet another set of physical assets purchased to produce goods and services. What is perhaps needed isa balanced approach that respects people as human beings and at the same time rewards them as per what they accomplish.	2002-12-12

The common thread across success stories is 1. Change is best done in big leaps than in gradual increments. 2. Change is an EIGHT-STAGE process. 3. The vital challenge at each stage is to bring about change in behavior - not strategy, systems or culture. 4. The &quot;see, feel and change&quot; approach is sustaining than the &quot;analyze, think and change&quot; approach since it influences feelings. The book goes on to explain each of the &quot;eight stages&quot; in detail with relevant case studies or stories narrated in first person. At the end of each chapter there is a small exercise that is recommended done with a team. There is also a crisp summary of what works, what does not work and stories to remember. <br />It is interesting to see that at the end of the book, it is recommended that to introduce change, it is better not to attempt to change the Culture at the outset. (&quot;A controversial but very important point. In a change effort, culture comes last, not first&quot;). Such an attempt would be futile since culture evolves over a long period. It is the change in behavior through the eight-stage process that is key and cultural change would follow. Each of the eight stages - Increase urgency, build the guiding team, get the vision right, communicate for buy-in, empower action, create short-term wins, don't let up, make change stick- are equally important. There are several examples to reinforce the importance of each stage and also to demonstrate that the lack of attention to any one of these is a prescription for failure. <br />The &quot;see, feel and change&quot; approach appeals to the heart. Human beings as we are, our hearts will continue to be an indispensable part of our anatomy irrespective of the technological changes and economic compulsions. We would be better off as a society if our hearts guide our decisions and actions affecting human beings. Changes are sweeping across businesses at an increasing pace. This book gives us a winning option - Let us see, let us feel and let us change.	2002-12-04

But if one has to think of a discipline that enabled these to happen through the collective effort of individuals and the pooling of resources, it is management - the accumulating body of thought and practice that makes organizations work. There is often a debate as to whether management is a science or an art. The fact lies somewhere in between. While dealing with tasks like productivity of machines, scheduling of projects, procurement of materials, and accounting, management looks like an exact science- number crunching and precise answers. But if this were all about management, computers would have replaced managers long ago. The challenge of dealing with uncertainties, crafting strategy in a unknown future, hiring, training, motivating and developing human assets, understanding customers' real needs are some of the tasks that managers routinely perform. Constantly managers are evaluated against performance targets; those that are determined by the collective needs of the stakeholders- customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees and society. The goals need to be in line with the Organizations' mission and reached within set time frames against fierce competition. Some organizations flourish while many perish. Management makes the difference. This applies to social institutions as well.<br />This book aims to give a broad overview of management as a discipline. To the extent it covers important topics in a comprehensive manner with good case studies thrown in, it has achieved the objective. It certainly has the width. Ideally suited for MBA aspirants to know what needs to be learnt in Business Schools. If you already have an MBA and rich professional experience, looking for an in-depth analysis of topics covered, look elsewhere.	2002-11-26

And imagine these services without IBM. It is this company (despite criticisms on various fronts) that was responsible for bringing computing to a scale that could run large organizations and even nations. It is natural that such a business assumes elephantine proportions in terms of size and product portfolio. Soon it is accused of monopolistic practices and the elephant slows down. In business terms it turns into a white elephant, slow and sick, on the verge of being dismantled; everyone looking for their fair share of the ivory. Such an elephant needs special treatment, and the ideal person to put it back on its feet, and bring in the agility of a horse should be adept at the skills of a mahout and the training of a Vet. Enter Louis Gerstner Jr.<br />Over the years, thanks to the unbridled market success and subsequently the shadow of antitrust, IBM by the late 80's was a large dysfunctional bureaucracy. IBM had a dress code that again had outlived its times. I remember a joke during the early days of IBM in India: \\" If you see a man dressed in a three piece suit crossing the road on a hot summer noon in Delhi, chances are that he is mad or he is from IBM.\\" <br />IBM's basic Beliefs were misinterpreted and practiced contrary to the very purpose of their origins. \\"Superior customer service\\" came to mean, \\"Servicing our machines on customers' premises,\\" instead of paying real attention to their business. \\" Excellence in everything we do\\" became an obsession with perfection and a led to several layers of checks and approvals, slowing down decision making and delaying product launches and response times. \\" Respect for the individual\\" soon became an interpretation for life long employment, entitlement for rich benefits and the freedom to ignore organizational priorities over that of the individuals'.As a group, the employees served themselves better than they did their customers. <br />Among the various issues on product portfolio, pricing and customer service, the greatest challenge faced by Lou appears to be on the cultural front at IBM. Being an outsider, and the time it would take to gain acceptance in a multinational organization as big as IBM, the biggest challenge is his battle is against IBM's insiders; entrenched bureaucrats, steeped in old ways who kill initiatives in new directions.  <br />The transformation that Lou brought starts with the compensation system. Commonality, Fixed rewards, Internal benchmarks and entitlement was what he saw in IBM. These words were replaced with Differentiation, Variable rewards, External benchmarks and Performance. <br />The chapters that deal with product portfolio decisions, strategy and e-Business make interesting reading. But the bull, I am sorry, the elephant is caught by the horns, I mean, by the tusks, quite early in the book. In the end, when Lou bids farewell to the new IBM, he admits that his heart has become a \\"true Blue\\". Jim Burke had mentioned to Lou before he took the IBM job: \\" You owe it to America to take the job\\". A job well done, now America owes it to Lou for saving the national treasure.	2002-11-20

It applies to all of us. Depending on the score on this, one may decide the true state of ones &quot;Tone&quot;, the word that is used to describe the physical well being of the individual. The four parameters (or moderators that prevent stress) responsible for sustained success in work and life are: <br />1. Autonomy : The availability of many choices that give good control in life<BR>2. Connectedness : Strong positive relationship at home, at work and in the community<BR>3. Perspective: The direction, purpose and passion about what one is doing.<BR>4. Tone: The feeling about the body, energy level, physical well being and appearance.<br />In a remarkable way, the clear connection between Tone as the enabler for the other three moderators is brought out in this book. The illustrations that support the concepts are excellent.  <br />Organizations spend billions of dollars in health care and suffer productivity loss due to the lack of physical well being of their employees. Employees on the other hand are sacrificing their health in the process of achieving career advancement. &quot;In early life, people give up their health to gain wealth. Then, later in life they give up some wealth to regain health.&quot;<br />This book is for HR managers and employees at all levels to help achieve substantial gains for the Organization; through employee well being that needs serious attention; as much as we do for career planning.	2002-11-12

I am in the midst of an exercise, as a leader of an internal task force entrusted with the responsibility of recommending a solution in a short time. This group is heterogeneous, drawn from different departments with a common problem on hand.<br />The four stages of group behavior (orientation, dissatisfaction, integration, and production) as described in this book, and the different styles of leadership appropriate at each stage is very essential understanding for any manager. More than this it is important to diagnose the stage at which the group is in and what action the leader needs to take to lead the team quickly to the Production stage.<br />This is a must read for all managers who wish to understand group behavior - for achieving optimal output.	2002-10-31

Traditionally, the boys who scored the maximum goals would receive the &quot;best player award&quot;. This team also followed this concept and every player focussed on scoring the goal himself without passing the puck. When a player gets the puck, his parents would cheer &quot; Strike-Boy-Strike&quot;.<br />This team NEVER won a tournament.<br />The new coach who joins this team analyses the problem and changes the reward mechanism.<br />The player who scored the goal gets 1 point.<br />The player who passed the puck to the scorer gets 2 points.<br />The goalkeeper who prevented a hostile goal gets 3 points.<br />There was also weightage for the factor (Goals scored/ No of strikes).<br />Suddenly this team starts playing differently. More goals are scored than before and the team starts winning match after match.<br />Alan Foster is this new coach. Alan had recently lost his job for lack of team skills. He is guided by Miss Weatherby, an aging African-American retired teacher and champion girls' basketball coach.<br />There is lots of similarity between a sports team and teams at the work place.  This book is a superb training guide for scoring team goals - for the Organization.	2002-10-30

How was the whale trained to do this, one may wonder. The training had actually started under water, where the whale was rewarded with food each time it crossed over the rope. The rope was then gradually raised and the whale jumps over it even if is above the water level.<br />Imagine the rope as the goal setting exercise in our organizations. We reward people for attaining their goals and we raise the bar every time to get the best out of every one.  <br />This book is about Goal Setting, Rewarding and Reprimanding. It also proves a very important concept. The normal confusion is that democratic managers sacrifice results while the result oriented managers sacrifice people. The One Minute Manager teaches us to be simultaneously good at achieving results and taking care of people.	2002-10-18

An international system to help governments in their fiscal expansions, employment generation, economic growth and stabilization while steering through rough economic weather was found necessary. While the IMF would concentrate on financing short term needs for governmental spending and also to help balance their foreign exchange positions, the World Bank would focus on developmental projects that would largely benefit people below the poverty line.

Suddenly we have Global Institutions serving private interests of the Wall Street. Would there be a better prescription for disaster for the developing countries? It is this vicious circle that has been brought out clearly by Prof Joseph Stiglitz.

Right from page No 1 of the book, Prof Stiglitz is on target in explaining case after case where the IMF has failed.

Malaysia is better off than Thailand after the crisis of 1998. IMF led \\"Bailouts\\" in many cases were to bailout the foreign private banks to recover local debts and not in the interests of the local economy. IMF also forces nations to maintain currency exchange rates at artificial levels with the same objective.

The IMF for example blamed the East Asian economies for lack of transparency for the sudden melt down. But the fact is that the crisis occurred at higher levels of transparency than a decade before, fuelled by the sudden exit of speculative hot money. The dangers of unbridled liberalization (and speculation) proved more lethal than the gains. <br />The world's most powerful nation and the self proclaimed champion of market economics ultimately protects its own interests when it comes to free trade.

In his characteristic style of narration, with exceptional command over facts and the English language, he is once again at his best in this book - a collection of his recent articles on the new economy and the future of Society. Starting from the invention of the steam engine ( James Watt - 1776),  the steam boat ( 1807) to the first railroad ( 1829), the first article &quot;Beyond the information Revolution&quot; describes  similarities between the Industrial revolution and the Information Revolution. Moore's law is applicable to the computer's processing power today. A similar phenomenon happened to the cost and productivity of textiles in the Industrial age. Since then, the global economies have transformed completely and today we have a knowledge-based society. The decline of Agriculture during the Industrial age is similar to the decline of Manufacturing in the last four decades. <br />What lies ahead, in terms of demographic, social, economic and business scenarios, during the next three decades makes fascinating reading. If you are in a hurry to find out what is in store, you may visit the last chapter directly. But the journey is more exciting than the destination. Please take the railroad powered by the steam engine and enjoy the lovely trip.	2002-09-14

This book is the narration of such simple stories in natural settings involving squirrels, beavers and geese. It is amazing that we, the most intelligent creatures on earth have so much to learn from such simple creatures. <br />The book also goes beyond drawing inferences from the moral of the stories. There is also a perfect setting to put them in action - Walton Works # 2, about to be closed down due to low productivity and accumulating losses. This would not be what a thousand and five hundred families who depend on this facility for a living be looking for. <br />Peggy Sinclair, is brought in from head office as the new General Manager to set things right or probably to preside over the liquidation of Walton Works # 2. Her first impression is that head office was right in its assessment to close down the plant and it is unfortunate that she would be at its helm when it would actually happen. She is assisted by a group of eighteen Divisional Managers whose lack of managerial capability is evident from day one and one of them gets promptly fired. She sees no hope to revive the morale and productivity of a bunch of lethargic and de-motivated team. Then comes our hero from the finishing department - Andy Longclaw. The motor bike riding Indian, who has the most productive department with an excellent team bubbling with enthusiasm - Gung-ho. Peggy and Andy meet each other by accident and the rest of the book is about their joint efforts to Gung-ho Walton Works #2. <br />A simple and powerful message for managers at all levels, I read this book whenever I feel a little low. Thanks Andy for handing down the wisdom of your Grandpa. Thanks Peggy for putting it in action and telling us this wonderful story. Gung-ho friends.	2002-08-13

Shortly afterward the board fires this CEO. In reality 40 CEOs of top 200 Fortune 500 companies lost their jobs- not retired but fired by their boards in 2000 alone.  The gap between aspirations and performance, between Companies that get the results against those who wish to reach there is what this book is about.<br />To give us a detailed account of this reality, I doubt if we can ever have a better team than this. Welcome to Execution. This book is not just for CEOs but is a must read for all Managers who are accountable for results. <br />The Organizational processes are classified as Strategic, People and Operational. The Strategic aspect deals with Economy, Markets, Competition and where the Organization would like to go from where it is. The Operational aspect deals with putting strategy into action; the how of reaching there with details on budgeting, reviews and course correction in the short run. The People process emerges as the core and most important element of the three. It is ultimately the people who are responsible to put Strategy into action. It is they who define the culture of the Organization and build its character.  In fact it is recommended that the CEO should never delegate the responsibility to hire and apprise his A team. The CEOs main strength comes from the top 30 percent of the people. It is important that a strong culture for performance and rewards is nurtured to get Strategy into reality.  Human Resources function should play a key role in assisting the CEO in this vital area. HR is not a staff function for hiring and compensating people, but it should integrate itself with he Operations and Strategic aspects to understand the quality of people required for the successful accomplishment of goals. Organizational mechanisms to identify high potential employees, constant appraisal and feed back and a plan to get the best out of these bright people is the foundation of the people process. Needless to say, Organizations run the risk of losing their best people to competition if such systems are not in place. In such a system it is also important to identify and remove obstacles for growth. Sometimes, over a period of time some people are elevated to their levels of incompetence and are occupying positions that are key to success of strategy. But unfortunately, while these executives have been successful in the past there is no guarantee of their reaching anywhere near the goals in future. They fail to understand markets, are not culturally tuned to performance driven environments and are a sure prescription for disaster. The people process should take the courage to clean up such patches and bring in the flexibility to hire the required talent from outside. <br />The CEO's is not an ornamental position of meeting the press, analysts and consultants, but an integral part of running the business; day in and day out. It is through such deep involvement and setting personal example of getting things done that he or she can continue to preside over the engine of growth and wealth creation.<br />This book is about achieving excellence in action. Highly recommended.	2002-07-08

Whatever the reason, it involves a business problem that needs a solution. Managers who have put in several years of service in the industry are often capable of finding the solution; yet the need for help from outside. The external consultants are expected to approach the problem with a open mind, analyze the issues in detail and give recommendations that are unbiased and implementable. Consulting is a demanding profession that needs multi-dimensional skills, the ability to work under stress and meet strict deadlines.<BR> <BR>Most consulting firms have their own style and methodology. It is important to note that there is no best way since each problem on hand is different. The knowledge gained in one assignment is systematically stored for reuse and reference for future, while ensuring that the confidentiality of the client information is maintained.<br />To be successful, consulting requires above average IQ coupled with excellent people skills and highest level of professional integrity- A combination that is hard to find. It is this rare combination with excellence in each trait and the exceptional quality of work that has made Mckinsey one of the most admired and respected firms till date. The ability to collect enormous amounts of data, analyze it using structured techniques, working long hours for six days a week, interviewing people, steering clear of organizational politics seem to be a way of life at &quot;the Firm&quot;. <br />Ethan Rasiel deserves credit on three points - Simplicity, frankness and clarity with which he has written this book based on his own experience at &quot;the Firm&quot;.<br />I recommend this book to three categories of people- Managers, students and consultants.<br />I recommend reading this book three times - Read, understand and practice.<br />Yes, I seem to have picked up the habit of &quot;three&quot;.

The railway too had its initial hype where people overestimated its impact and drove its stocks to dizzy heights. Public memory is short; we have seen the repetition of this phenomenon during the last five years and this time the craze was the Internet. Railways have since survived and flourished bringing in prosperity and transforming the industrial landscape. That was in a physical world but in the new era it is the seamless flow and abundance of information that determines and controls business decisions.<br />While working on supply chains, what strikes me most is the proverbial &quot;Weakest link&quot;. In most cases the structure and functioning of these chains is stunted by the lack of connectivity and information sharing between the participating entities. In dealing with such distributed systems that are outdated and hierarchical, we often tend to automate existing processes by linking isolated legacy systems rather than inventing radically new processes that are made possible by the technologies of computing and communications. To give another example, even after the advent of electric power and electric motors, the shop floors were designed to install machines as close to the source of power - the legacy of steam power! Unlearning at times is more difficult than learning.<br />Think of water as an important resource for survival. You are living in a self-contained village that has a small lake, which supplies just enough water for the current needs. Look at another village close by. It is on the banks of a perennial river that in addition to meeting the basic needs of water for drinking, washing and agriculture allows you to navigate and trade goods with far flung towns. Soon this village is bubbling with activity and becomes a major hub for trade. It then builds a port and also needs a small fleet of coast guard to police the lucrative waters.  Now you have two options. Either migrate to the port town or connect your lake to the river with a canal to attract the excess traffic and have a small share of the business. But new businesses need new skills. You acquire some and hire the others. A quiet village is suddenly transformed. This analogy came to my mind while reading a chapter in this book that compares the internet with a flowing river that can be harnessed to ones advantage.<br />The best part of the book is that each chapter is devoted to a certain topic- Knowledge Management, Supply Chain, Customer Relationships, Human Resources, Corporate structure, Corporate culture and Leadership - and the impact of the Internet on these Organizational facets. &quot;The Company of the Future&quot; finally emerges as a multidimensional and interconnected global entity, never in isolation on any aspect of business.	2002-06-25

Books	5	21	25	N	N	Simple summary of a powerful concept	Most companies that have implemented Six Sigma initiatives have seen themselves pushed into a higher orbit of business excellence. Six Sigma can be a Business Transformation, Strategic Improvement or a narrowly focussed problem solving technique. But it involves deep commitment from top to bottom with a clearly defined agenda for results. New initiatives that have profound effects across the Organization are bound to meet with resistance and skepticism either due to the natural inertia for change or due to the fear of the unknown and the resulting insecurity. It is important to seed the concepts in a simple and comprehensive manner in the minds of all employees and energize them before any initiative is planned. Care should be taken not to immerse the participants into high sounding jargon and make it appear as yet another gimmick from consultants. This book meets this requirement very well.<br />Six Sigma is clearly explained as a customer focussed initiative, driving down defects, cycle time and costs. Various analytical methodologies and statistical techniques are listed and demystified for those who are otherwise allergic to these techniques. For readers scared of Six Sigma on the presumption that it is a form of martial art, it would be heartening to note that wearing a &quot; black belt&quot; is a professionally rewarding experience and worth pursuing assignment. <br />There are plenty of charts and illustrations that make things easier to assimilate. <br />This book is recommended distribution to all employees even if the company has no immediate plans on  Six Sigma. Plant the seed and let it germinate.	2002-06-19

Human capabilities can be grouped under three broad categories-Technical Skills, Cognitive abilities and Emotional Intelligence. While all the three are essential for performance, better and sustainable results emanate from EI based leadership more so at higher levels of management responsibilities.<br />EI capabilities are classified into four main domains- Self Awareness, Self Control, Social Awareness and Relationship Management which are further broken down into eighteen competencies. The leadership styles that emerge are either Resonant or Dissonant. Visionary, Coaching, Affiliative and Democratic styles are Resonant while Pace Setting and Commanding are Dissonant. Primal leadership relies on the understanding of these distinct styles and the ability to identify and build those styles that are in lacking and consciously eliminating the dysfunctional. <br />The authors, in addition to listing and describing all the above factors in detail, constantly touch upon the anatomy of the human brain and link its functioning to explain the results. By understanding the pattern of information flows and its processing, it is argued that it one can identify and practice favorable patterns that are responsible for resonance.   These concepts are then extended to maximizing emotional intelligence of teams. <br />As clearly brought out in the book, acquiring primal leadership skills needs lots of practice and it may take even months. Reading the book is just the beginning to that wonderful resonant journey.	2002-06-18

In most cases, especially while dealing with businesses that are geographically dispersed, connectivity has played a key role in deciding on the solution set. Trade off between centralized vs. de-centralized structures, TCO, maintainability and application response times on WAN have been crucial factors in decision making. Going by Eliyahu Goldratt's \\"Theory of Constraints\\", it is not difficult to guess that bandwidth availability and costs have dictated the boundaries of IT architectures. The \\"Last Mile Problem\\" used to sound like the last post.  Not anymore, even in developing countries if Telecosm becomes a global reality. With abundance of cheap bandwidth we are entering a new era in IT Solutions. If Microcosm could pack computing power far exceeding the power of legacy mainframes on the PC sitting on our desks, Telecosm is about distributing this power from the center of the network to the peripheral devices. The ethernet card connecting the \\"teleputer\\" dissolves into the World Wide Web; World Wide Wait  is eliminated by World Wide Waves. \\"The Network is the Computer\\".<br />Microcosm has multiplied Computing power and Storage and divided costs by million folds.  Connectivity between these massive and powerful systems has not kept pace during this phase. Better late than never, enter Telecosm. Fiber and Satellites using light and electromagnetic waves transfer information across the globe at Petabit rates. This paradigm shift in communications is bound to have profound effects on business and society. We will soon be wasting bandwidth as we are now wasting transistors on our processors. Gilder narrates this phenomenon very well.<br />After reading the first 3 chapters of the book, I decided to revisit my college books on Quantum Physics- Planck's Constant, Wave Theory, Speed of light, Schroedinger's equation come in handy to really appreciate the power of Telecosm. For ready reference the book provides an excellent glossary of all technical terms that help have a quick recap. I would appreciate if the next edition contains detailed notes on concepts like WDM, CDMA and Packet Switching in the appendix. <br />The future looks so bright that I foresee a global scarcity of sunglasses! But we still have a problem on hand- the limitation imposed by the speed of light. But if God created light, we need to urge with him to create something that is faster. That will need different lines of communication not discussed in this book. Till then, let there be light!	2002-05-31

Collecting and analyzing historical data from over 66 industry segments the conclusions by the authors is baffling. This is not a case where statistics is used conveniently to support untested theories using available tools to prove a point. The approach to understanding market dominance and the role of pioneers and followers is path breaking. Contrary to common belief, data shows that in many cases the pioneers have as little as 9 % market share. The ingredients for success are therefore not being there first, but doing the right things. <br />Five factors that emerge as key to ensuring long term success and market dominance are Vision, Persistence, Financial Commitment, Innovation and Asset leverage- factors that are structurally related in a causal chain starting with a clear vision for a mass market. There are innumerable examples and detailed cases where the inability to see a mass market for  innovative products has resulted in late comers grabbing the market from incumbents. Fear of cannibalization of existing products, bureaucracy, complacency, are some other causes that stifle growth. <br />After explaining the hypothesis, a good and crisp summary of the conclusions from the historical data, every chapter proceeds sequentially to substantiate the findings. This is a rare combination of business history, statistical analysis and strategy. It is this unique combination and the unconventional wisdom that is bound to make this book a classic in its own right. The range of products covered varies from diapers to couriers and computers. IBM, Microsoft, Fed Ex, Xerox, Gillette are some companies that are discussed in detail.  <br />Comparing it with other books on similar research, my prescription for business would be:<br />Innovators Dilemma + Will and Vision + Built to Last + Good to Great = Road to Market dominance. <br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-22

We come across several instances where the work place is described as: &quot;foggy; smoky; need a chimney to clear the place; this place stinks&quot;. Work at such places is not only drudgery for those who work in but also an even worse experience for customers who need to interact with them. Typically such places are described as bureaucratic bastions wrapped in red tape, blissfully wasting time and energy in all things other than serving the customer. No prizes for guessing an &quot;ideal fit&quot; describing such situations. <br />If you cannot breathe, then swim; learn to swim from fish -literally. Learn what you should from the ones who are the best at it. This book shows the way through a simple story, with a happy ending. Mary Jane Ramirez is caught in the midst of a personal tragedy and a very disgusting workplace. She is the manager of back office jobs in a financial services company that is aptly termed as the &quot;toxic energy dump&quot;. Help comes from a most unexpected corner: Lonnie who sells fish in Seattle's most famous Pike Place fish market. He prescribes four simple principles that transform Mary, her workplace and the rest of her life. <br />a) Choose your attitude - You may not have a choice in what you are doing, but you are in full control of how to do it. Do it with a smile. b) Play - Do not forget this important element when you grow up in age. It is equally important to have fun while you work. c) Make their day - Make every interaction with the customer a great experience for them to remember d) Be present - Be fully present in interactions as if you are meeting a long lost friend.<br />Every human being is compared to a clock that needs to be wound and energized from time to time.  This book is bound to do just that if you are in need of it.	2002-05-14

What Ford did to the automobile industry, McDonald's has done to the fast food industry in terms of application of principles of assembly line and efficiencies of mass production. The similarity seems to end there. While the automobile industry is applauded as the mother of all industries, the fast food industry in its present form is depicted as the source of many evils. Increasing waistlines for consumers and miseries to farmers; Exploitation of immigrant labor and spread of dangerous bacteria through contaminated food; the list is very exhaustive and sometimes stinks. The Law seems to be a silent spectator to these brutal facts thanks to the powerful lobby of the fast food chains. The brunt of the attack is borne by McDonalds, because it is the most recognized brand worldwide; perhaps more than the Stars and Stripes. <br />There is of course the other side of the coin conveniently ignored in this book. I read in a book on Globalization that no two nations having McDonalds have gone to war with each other. Statistically speaking, if we have McDonalds in every country we could ensure everlasting peace and wind up the Military. Bombers can be used to drop Burgers and French-fries. McDonalds has certainly helped modernize the food industry in many developing countries and has become a symbol of globalization. Personally, when I travel outside India, I prefer and in fact search for McDonalds or Pizza Hut and the moment I sight one, a sigh of relief. What more do we need than the assurance of consistent quality of food at affordable prices. It is also heartening to note as admitted in the book that for lovers of vegetarian food, lots of new items are getting added on the menu. If not today, competition will ensure that the tastes of the consumer will ultimately prevail. <br />One more study and this time on unbranded and unorganized sector of the food industry is needed. That would probably bring out the better side of the big brands. The big brands have the muscle todemand and get quality inputs from their suppliers, control prices and assure standards. It is important to focus on these strengths and eliminate the ills. Let us not throw the baby with the bath water. <br />Despite my points in defense of the fast food industry, this book is certainly a must read for all to understand the industry from a different perspective. But when you enter a fast food joint, please forget what you have read in this book if you are keen to enjoy the food.<br />Let's have a bite!	2002-03-14

And it is certain that this cannot be managed or eliminated. What is important is the extent to which we are able to quantify the error in alternate scenarios and possibly arrive at decisions that are optimal. Had there been an \\"ideal toolkit\\", we could have avoided all business failures and planet earth would have been the safest place to live in for all entrepreneurs. Mankind would have awarded such a discovery with nothing less than the Nobel Prize. To expect our naked eye to have a clear picture of the universe will mean the demise of all telescopes and investments in space exploration. Strategy needs vision and this vision needs tools. <br />This book provides a framework to classify uncertainty into 4 basic types and links it to major strategic decisions facing the Organization. It is a one to many relationship and situational in character. To make the understanding better, lots of examples ( Detailed case studies would have been even better) are thrown in. In the end our comfort in understanding Strategy certainly improves. But the exploration of this largely unmapped terrain will continue in the coming decades as we discover new lands. This is for certain.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-03-13

It primarily deals with consumer product companies and retail chains. The attributes selected for research are Price, Product, Access, Service and Experience - mostly at POP interactions of Customers at retail outlets. It does not deal with business processes or practices within and across a wider Industry range.<br />The title suggests that this research is about \\"Great Companies\\". The definition of \\"Greatness\\" is nowhere defined and we do not have enough evidence to suggest that the data collected from over 5000 Customers is relevant to test the hypothesis. <br />While the initial chapters try to define a framework and most Companies are mapped to their primary and secondary attributes, the distinction of \\"excellence\\" on these attributes gets blurred on some occasions. Many cases can perhaps be conveniently moved across chapters, each devoted to one primary attribute. This may be in part due to the highly qualitative and descriptive approach to the analysis and the inability to bring out the core findings within the limited pages. <br />I am unable to understand the fundamental difference between the proven \\"Positioning\\" methodology and the findings of this book. If a conventional Multi-Dimensional Scaling were adopted, would the results be different? .<br />For those interested in consumer products and retail, some well-narrated cases will not disappoint.	2002-01-17

One is sure to come across surprises in each, since findings from the data analysis of several hundred companies (from which the 11 great companies finally emerge), is much contrary to commonly held perceptions and beliefs. This makes it a great experience to read this book, page after page.<br />I have read &quot;Built to Last &quot; (Co-authored by Prof. Collins) twice; once when it was published and for the second time in Q2-2000 wondering what the &quot;New Economy&quot; was for the &quot;Old economy&quot; Visionary Companies that were &quot;Built to last &quot;. In my opinion &quot;most of the visionary companies would succeed in any kind of transformation in the marketplace...Dot Coms may kindly note.... &quot; (Read my review on Amazon.com- published May 9, 2000).<br />Given this insight, &quot;Good to Great&quot; is certainly a must read to see if anything has changed since then. I looked at the similarities and differences between these two research studies. In my opinion, it is hard to separate the two. By the time one finishes reading the good to great concepts, the similarity is striking. It would be wonderful to see companies that are great and ALSO built to last. Prof. Collins devotes a chapter exclusively to bring out the synergy between the &quot;Built to last&quot; and &quot;Good to Great &quot; concepts. The equation is:<br />Established Company or Start-up + Good to Great Concepts -&gt; Sustained Great Results + Built to Last Concepts -&gt; Enduring Great Company.<br />It is interesting to note that these concepts in the author's opinion can be applied for achieving greatness of any Organization, provided one is convinced that these principles can be applied. <br />The research methodology, selection criteria, rigor in data collection, data analysis and conclusions and the innumerable examples supporting each dimension is of the highest academic standards. The notes at the end of the book will prove useful for any student pursing research on similar topics.<br />The book opens with the words &quot; Good is the enemy of Great&quot;. Probably I need to change my vocabulary after reading this book!<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-04

With the advent of Ford's manufacturing techniques, there was a consolidation in the Auto industry. Within a couple of decades the number of automobile manufacturers fell from over a hundred to less than twenty and the big three cornering over ninety percent of the market share. Detroit became the center of pilgrimage for the rest of the world trying to emulate and replicate this success story in other continents. <br />Silently, the Japanese led by Toyota were working on a different concept of putting the automobile in the hands of the customer, at better quality, lesser costs, shorter development times and with the ability to offer a wider choice. The statistics collected from these &quot;lean systems&quot; is mind boggling. The competitive advantage that Japan enjoyed over the American system was neither due to lower wages in Japan nor due to higher levels of automation as widely believed. It was primarily the lean machine that was conquering the mass machine.<br />This book is based on the research done in the 1980's and published around 1990. The authors while acclaiming lean manufacturing as the panacea for the ills of manufacturing systems globally had at the time of the research and the publication of this work, probably ignored the next major change that would sweep across continents. Cars ride on highways, but today's businesses are quickly shifting gear and using a super fast highway for collaborating and for managing their global presence. Thanks to the Internet, the economics of information is transforming the economics of things. Dell is probably a good example of the new business model that could not have been imagined in the 80's. The tearing down of artificial walls across countries and continents also happened in the last decade. <br />We are badly in need of a repeat research study of the kind done in this book, in the face of the new realities. Global companies run by global citizens serving a global market and using a global currency will probably happen sooner than we expect.	2001-12-28

Ford Motor today, will at best laugh this away and may be some years down the line this effort will appear as a fairy tale. Now companies believe in doing what they can do best and get rid of the rest. Out-sourcing is essential to retain core competence and is no longer a threat to existence. <br />Re-engineering focuses on processes within Corporations. This is analogous to a situation where each functional department had its stand-alone software before the advent of ERP. ERP demolished internal walls and resulted in substantial improvements in operational performance . Similar is the urgency to tear down the walls between a network of corporations that collaborate together to deliver solutions to the same end customer. Still companies exist in isolation and believe in -&quot;good fences make good neighbors&quot;. Hammer introduces the term &quot;Virtual Integration&quot;, the polar opposite of what Ford tried to do in River Rouge. Ford today is a &quot;Designer and Marketer&quot; of automobiles, while thousands of its suppliers take care of manufacturing the parts that make the final machine. <br />The Internet transforms inter-enterprise processes and becomes the collaborative hub. Co-customers and Co-suppliers take advantage of this new phenomenon. Technologies like XML and protocols like RosettaNet enable the seamless integration of Business Processes across Organizational boundaries. These developments do not mend walls between Corporations but help us in tearing them apart.<br />&quot; The Agenda&quot; predicts a world where businesses work as a network of collaborative virtual entities and outlines the challenges in the new terra. Throughout the book, the focus is on the end customer and to make the business - ETDBW - Easy To Do Business With; and to deliver MVA - More Value Added.<br />Now what is on your agenda? .

A customer in a Far Eastern country needs to wait for over 2 months to receive a quotation for an AS/400. Not hard to guess what follows.<br />One of America's most admired companies, IBM starts slipping, losing over $ 16 billion in just 4 consecutive years by 1993. There was no problem about revenues. IBM was making $ 64 billion attracting most of the money spent on Information Technology. But it was spending $ 69 billion to earn it. At $ 26 billion in debt, a figure that is more than what most developing countries owed the rest of the world, it needed a miracle. It needed Lou.<br />A man, who was inducted from an industry that had no relevance to computing, rescues big Blue from near bankruptcy. The only thing in common between biscuits and computers is that they almost have the same shelf life. The success of both businesses requires the understanding of customer needs, speed of product introduction, inventory management and cost control. Lou Gerstner from RJR Nabisco steps in to clean up the mess at IBM- and he does this with passion and not with compassion.<br />Harvard educated, with extensive experience at McKinsey, American Express and RJR Nabisco, Lou brings in his own team, who again have no exposure to the computer industry. The &quot;Cookie man hires chicken man&quot; - Lou hires Bruce Herreld from Boston Chicken to fill in the position of Chief strategist for example. Key to the surgical operation in cost control is Jerome York from the automobile industry. And this list grows on similar lines.<br />Lou has his own share of blues. He would not like to remember the fiasco at Atlanta with IBM's promise of &quot;bullet proof reliability&quot;. &quot; If self -parody were an Olympic sport, IBM would have medaled&quot; said Fortune Magazine. Lou's wrath against this leading business magazine is another story by itself.<br />There is a clear shift in the strategic direction at IBM in the recent past. Its departure from proprietary system architecture to embrace open technologies. From competition to &quot;co-opetition&quot;. PC business is its &quot;Vietnam&quot;. IBM realizes this and signs up with Dell to supply components in this segment. It embraces Linux and Java and quickly positions itself as e-business solution provider. Lou is again driving from basics. Biscuits and computers have so much in common- ask the customer, under-promise and over-deliver.	2001-09-27

Gujral's grand daughter demands a pizza and insists on having it from Pizza Hut.<br />Well, the walls have disappeared and Uncle Sam is marching all over the globe; a phenomenon similar to the presence of the British Empire in the nineteenth Century. But this time it is not imperialism and not a conquest of countries for Colonization. It is a global urge to democratize Information, Technology and Finance in order to achieve higher standards of living. This is an opportunity to create AND distribute wealth across borders without walls. The inefficient are weeded out and market forces are sweeping across continents.<br /> Individual countries or institutions no longer control the global markets. The flow of investments - both short term and long term- are a collective action of millions of investors - &quot;The electronic herd&quot; which is constantly looking around for promise of greener pastures. Governments who recognize this will have more transparent, efficient and honest administrations to attract and retain the herd. The herd can also desert in a stampede as we saw in East Asia in 1998.<br />But all the freedom, wealth and good things are not without pain and risk. On one hand we find the number of billionaires has multiplied and at the other extreme we still have over a billion people who do not earn even a dollar a day. Billions for some and billions with none. There are rising tensions not due to the arms race of the cold war, but the uncertainty over the impact of globalization. For many that are hurt in the absence of a safety net, globalization is a threat more dangerous than a real war. It is in this context that the careful management of the globalization process across diverse countries assumes significance. No other nation other than America seems to have the capability to lead the world in the new era. In the process if America becomes arrogant and irresponsible in her actions, we may once again fall back into a world of walls that inhibit freedom, innovation and a better life for all.<br />Apart from the economic and social implications of globalization, Thomas Friedman also takes you on a global tour, which I enjoyed thoroughly.	2001-09-10

To me it was a surprise that we needed a standard to start a conversation. But then the technologies behind the millions of conversations and communications across the globe have constantly defied standards to create discontinuities at a rapid pace. Today, voice is a small component of the global traffic. Digitization has made it possible to carry Data, Voice and Video at unimaginable speeds - You can shift a large public library from coast to coast within 14 seconds. But this seems to be just the beginning. Amazed? Read on.<br />The book traces the history of telecommunications from the discovery of the telephone till today's high speed digital transmission through optic fibers. Nortel is at the center stage throughout the book while Cisco and Lucent are seen as its major competitors. The Telecom Industry is thus not a part of the &quot;new economy&quot; and players like Cisco are new players in the old economy Industry. This is what I infer from this book.  The secret behind Nortel's success and survival for over hundred years , weathering economic and technological discontinuities seems to be its ability to continuously innovate through investments in R&amp;D and by promoting an entrepreneurial work culture.<br />Nortel has been &quot;at the  right places at the right time&quot;- Enchasing on discontinuities .

This well researched book is a must read for all executives sitting pretty in cozy cabins of successful companies worldwide. The powerful message it conveys is to remain competitive in the market place through innovation (Breakthrough, Substantial and Continuous). The market is a place where there is a continuous process of weeding out the inefficient and the complacent. Those basking in the glory of the past suddenly realize that they have no future; and the realization comes a little too late.<br />Based on the research and statistical analysis of over 1000 companies it would be interesting to see that the pace of innovation has increased rapidly and only a handful of today's top 100 will survive by year 2020.

The concept of Digital Business Design (DBD) lays emphasis on understanding the business processes and then use IT to digitize it. This is a definite departure from many contemporary books that ignore many business issues in the context of Technology.<br />The comparison of performance between companies that are digitized more than their competitors is excellent. The improvement in performance is due to the speed and agility with which we can manage business processes that have more &quot;bits&quot; than &quot;atoms&quot;. <br />The case studies discussed in this book - one chapter devoted to each company in every category of business - are well researched. In the section devoted to &quot;Incumbents on the move&quot; GE is an outstanding example.  To quote Jack Welch in his recent speech to shareowners in Atlanta -&quot; Digitization is, in fact, a game changer for GE. And, with competition cutting back because of the economy, this is the time for GE to widen the digital gap, to further improve our competitive position.

In this book the difference between fiction and reality gets blurred !<br />The common thread that runs across all chapters is - Connectivity, Speed and Intangibles, and it is certainly advisable to read &quot;Blur&quot; before reading this book. I find it very difficult to visualize many events that are forecast in this book. The main effects of IT (Information Technology)  in the new economy  seem to be the phenomenal increase in the ratio between I (Intangibles) and T (Tangibles) ; the redistribution of wealth wherein the individuals manage their own risks; securitization of talent ; and virtually trade in everything thereby creating new markets and opportunities.<br />A word of caution. Check your vision both before and after reading this book!	2001-02-01

Then came the famous Keynesian theory that explained the need to put purchasing power in the hands of people to create the virtuous cycle of economic growth. But one of the fundamental assumptions of all economic theories is the principle of  &quot;other things remaining the same&quot;. Now that most factors assumed to be given and constant at the time of these theories have drastically changed and even been eliminated in economies that are borderless and connected by the internet, countries and corporations can no longer base their strategies on old economic theories. <br />Kenichi Omae describes four dimensions of the new economy - Physical, Borderless, Multiples and Cyber and the need to operate and leverage on all the four in order to be successful in the &quot;new continent&quot;. But to travel in a continent, we need a highway, a vehicle and the fuel that runs it. He describes these as platforms for transaction, delivery and payment. Assuming that a company actually does business on all four dimensions using established platforms, it becomes a Godzilla generating high market multiples and further enabling its growth through acquisitions.<br />Conceptually good reading. Countries like India will certainly benefit by working on these concepts in the new economy, an opportunity to catch-up with what was missed in the last century- an opportunity to move from the &quot;cyber backyard&quot; into the mansion of future wealth.	2001-01-09

What is most impressive about this book is the author's frankness in admitting his own flaws and how he was able to overcome them. Many of the instances he cites are probably true with most of us. In my case I have immensely benefited by overcoming atleast 2 lies that were holding me back.

Starting from a nearly  bankrupt inheritance and the problems of his father's business Craig McCaw  is superb in strategizing and execution. He quickly consolidates his  business in the cable TV segment before venturing into mobile  communications. He shows remarkable courage in predicting the growth  pattern in each business segment he operates and takes big risks to pump in  money to achieve leadership in his area of operation. <br />Reading this book  reminds me the story of Jim Clark (&quot;The New New Thing &quot; - by  Michael Lewis ) who also follows a similar pattern in his mega plans,  moving from one success to another.<br />It would have been better had the  author explained a little more about the concepts of technology in each  business outlined, so that it would be easy for a reader without exposure  in these areas to understand the real picture and the theme of this  book.<br />If you own a cell phone please read this book.

There is a lot of confusion these days in terms of trying to define the rules of success in the new economy. One thing for sure is that the pace of  change  we are experiencing today is unprecedented and can be ignored at  our own peril. But amazingly, the rules of the game have not changed - as  argued so powerfully in this book; the pace of the game has increased and  it requires greater speed and agility to keep playing.<br />But if the rules  are the same and the pace has increased what about the playing field? Well,  it is turning bigger and a player who wants to be in the game should know  every inch of it.<br />The main theme of the book centers on the concept that  while we may adopt new strategies in the information economy the  fundamental economic principles still apply.  The goods that we are dealing  with are information goods that are costly to produce and cheap to  reproduce. In such a scenario, what are the cost characteristics, pricing  strategies and market structures? Similarly the concepts of Versioning,  Rights management, Lock-in, Networks &amp; positive feedback are analyzed  in great detail with appropriate illustrations and cases.<br />Highly  recommended.	2000-08-15

Hence this book and the theory  that can be put to use to achieve dramatic results.  One question that a  reader is likely to encounter in reading this is whether to read &quot;The  Goal&quot; before reading this book. I feel that it does not matter as long  as you finished reading both. In fact Mr Goldratt relies heavily on several  chapters of &quot;The Goal&quot; to illustrate the theory.<br />Whatever the  nature of business, Throughput, Operating Expenses and Inventory are the  parameters on which managers grabble with and try to gain control.

It is also shown that for companies  that created most of the wealth in a very short span, this ratio is the  lowest; as low as 0.03 in some. This is attributed to the recognition of  intangible assets of the new economy companies that are not reported in the  balance sheet but recognized by the stock market. <br />It is then argued that  in order to add value and create wealth , companies need to adopt a  strategy to optimize the use of all their assets - Physical, Financial,  Organizational, Customer and Employee &amp; Customer assets. The book  defines each of these assets and a small case study is presented as to how  a particular company succeeded in creating value using each of these  assets. An analogy is drawn to the understanding of DNA on the basis of  four amino acids. These five assets seem to be those with which the authors  want to crack the code of creating value and wealth and these assets are  the &quot;business genome&quot;. The framework that evolves is termed as  &quot;Value Dynamics&quot;.<br />I was keenly looking forward for a  methodology that would enable a quantitative analysis. Maybe I can find it  in the next edition!<br />The use of Information Technology to measure and  report what needs to be measured appears as a summary in the last  chapter.<br />Albert Einstein as quoted in this book had rightly said  &quot;Sometimes what counts can't be counted and what can be counted  doesn't count&quot;.	2000-07-05

This is a short story. I recommend that one reads it very slowly or if need be twice, since the moral of the story as applicable to the reader might take some time to reflect.<br />It may be appropriate to relate this  story not just to individuals but also to companies that need new direction  in view of what is happening in the market place- more relevant in the  digital economy. The longer the company has been in a particular business  and more successful it has been in the old economy, this story needs to be  read by all employees of that company. That will set the thinking to seek  &quot;new cheese&quot; that is necessary for survival. Employees also will  prepare to change their mindset to acquire skills, change attitudes and  look at new opportunities. After all the focus is on long term  employability and not long term employment. <br />The case that comes to my  mind is the large number of &quot;sick&quot; companies in India,  particularly those owned by the Government. There was a time when a job in  these companies was considered secure and comfortable with the assurance of  the pay check every month. These companies sustained on subsidies and  financial support from the Government that over a period of time assured  cheese to all employees as their &quot;entitlement&quot;. But now that the  supply of cheese has run out, thanks to the new economic policies driven by  market forces, what we see in most of the employees is a feeling of anger  and frustration - &quot; I want my cheese back!&quot;<br />Read this book -  and &quot; Say Cheese ! &quot;	2000-07-03

This book is a brief description of the impact of the Internet on Businesses of all kind. It starts with b2b e-business success stories like Cisco, FedEx and Ingram Micro whose business volumes on the web is several  hundred fold greater than more popular b2c companies like Amazon.Com and  Yahoo !. The most important factor to succeed in e-business starts with the  right vision of the top management and the book provides a simple and  effective framework that integrates business and technology drivers with  the e-business strategy.<br />&quot;Digital Transformation&quot; as defined by  KPMG is not just the conversion of text, images, voice and video into  digital form but also involves the changes in the business processes  associated with them. Once the vision and strategy are in place it is  important to move fast and get the &quot;first mover advantage&quot; since  in the new economy it is the first movers who walk away with all the  marbles. <br />One chapter each is devoted to b2b and b2c challenges and in  each case the business model is brought out well.<br />The authors then borrow  the concept of &quot; disruptive technology&quot; - the term coined by Prof  Clayton Christensen in his book &quot; The innovators dilemma&quot;. The  web as a disruptive technology and what this means to diverse industries -  Travel, Broking, Automobiles is quite interesting. In fact I have started  reading &quot; Innovator's Dilemma&quot; once again.<br />The final chapter is  devoted to future trends ( and threats !). <br />An excellent summary of what  it means to be transformed- Digitally, in just about 120 pages.	2000-06-26

I am convinced that most of the visionary companies would succeed  in any kind of transformation in the marketplace. It is these companies  that set &quot;BHAGs&quot;, have excellent cultures, care for their image  and emerge as stars in the final analysis. Good  management principles  cannot be discarded for the sake of temporary gain. And that is precisely  why these companies have survived in turbulent times in their making . This  is not to say that all 18 companies would repeat their performance for the  next 50 years; but if they continue to be guided by the same fundamental  principles on which they are built , they will certainly last forever.  <br />Dot coms may kindly note....	2000-05-09

It presents powerful concepts that will soon be recognized on par with those that have shaped our economies till date. More important, this is for the future and not a thesis based on historical research.<br />Traditional economic theories have  largely been successful at a time when assumptions were made - due to lack  of information in the market place. Students in Business Schools are still  taught &quot;Economic value of perfect information&quot;. Remove the  constraint on the  availability of information ; Traditional Business  models instantly collapse and give way to the new economic model that is  driven by connectivity and standards. <br />The book  focuses on two basic  forces that shatter traditional business structures- 1. The separation of  the economics of information from the economics of things. 2.  The blowup  of the tradeoff between richness and reach of information. The result is  &quot;Deconstruction&quot;.<br />The authors explain each of these concepts  with excellent illustrations and cases and then go on to provide a  framework for competing in the new economy. <br />This book is written in such  a manner that the concepts could be used by managers in diverse industries  - If they are keen that their traditional businesses (and their jobs) are   NOT &quot;Blown to bits&quot;. <br />Excellent !	2000-04-28
