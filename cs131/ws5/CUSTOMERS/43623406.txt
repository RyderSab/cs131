I'm also biased against books written by a writer for \\"Spin,\\" a magazine that used to cover bands I needed to know about but now mostly covers music I don't want to hear, in a fashion I don't want to see.     And Klosterman's author photo almost caused me to ditch this book by the cash register (he looks like a smug, flamboyantly \\"out\\" version of Corey Feldman's character from \\"Stand by Me\\").     But I think the index sold me. You don't see many books of this ilk with an index anymore, and given that it accurately annotates Klosterman's rapid-fire name dropping, it must've been a fairly daunting task to compile.    Anyway, this book surprised me the most of all the books I've read this year because it's a lightweight-but-heartfelt memoir by a genuine music geek who's genuinely and frequently amusing.  I think I gave in to the book's grip when, upon planning a cross country roadtrip, the author decided he'd need to bring only the barest, most essential CD's from his collection of 2,000 discs... and settled on 600. That, to me, is extremely amusing.    There are some worthwhile sections and insights here -- the idea that most people go to shows/concerts simply to be seen and to say that a) it rocked or b) the band used to rock but now they suck; that music critics basically spend their days writing about their mail; the weird, resin-soaked theories about \\"Kid A\\" and its relationship to 9/11 (essentially useless but surprisingly engrossing); and especially the observations about the Great White concert disaster (up to and including a by-stander's comments about drugs and trust).     Some people are slagging \\"Killing\\" for Klosterman's reflections on his love life and, yes, that's the element that's going to win or lose many readers; and I don't know that it wouldn't have been a better (though perhaps shorter) book without it; and I admit that the women are sketched so hastily that I couldn't keepthem straight in my mind; but it also makes for a more human book and if you've ever been involved in the kinds of situations Klosterman is describing, I think you'll probably find something here you at least lend moderate empathy toward.    The bottom line is: He knows music and he's a relentlessly entertaining, self-deprecating guy. He's not quite Nick Hornby, but he's also not quite a Flaming Corey Feldman from Spin, either.	2005-09-05

Orson Welles said that and it's true.  Everybody's story, eventually, ends with at least some degree of unhappiness, and there's unhappiness galore in the completion of Woodrow Call's tale.   <br /> <br />I would almost aruge that \\"Streets\\" isn't even a proper sequel to \\"Dove\\" at all, but an epilogue.  It's a big story yet it lacks the epic, decades-spanning sprawl of the other novels, and the focus is on finality and closure. <br /> <br />It's bleak, cold and a surprisingly angry book. \\"Dove\\" had its share of harshness, and didn't exactly end on a pleasant note, but \\"Streets\\" is worlds away from its predecessor in terms of violence, savagery and fatalism.   <br /> <br />Here, we find Call on the edge of 70, no longer the legendary dynamo that led the Montano cattle drive.  Now he's aged into his size and is consistently underestimated by almost every one he meets.  Arthritis makes his knuckles swell to the point he has to remove the trigger guard from his rifle in order to use it and McMurtry almost seems to relish ladling indignities on one of his most beloved creations.  Perspective gained at a point too late to use is a phenomenon as sad as it is common. <br /> <br />But to stop navel gazing for a second, this is a book crammed with excellent characters: the trainrobber, Joey Garza, is a great and horrifying character (it's a little disconcerting to discover that someone like this could actually wander out of McMurtry's imagination); McMurtry also gets good mileage out of John Wesley Hardin, Charles Goodnight, Maria Garza and my favorite figure in the entire series, the Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes.  And Crow Town is one of the most vividly imagined settings I've encountered in a book in years.  <br /> <br />This is also a novel dappled with great scenes, particularly Call's confrontation with the hard sheriff; the opening introduction of Brookshire; and especially Maria's pilgrimage across the frozen Pecos with the whores, which is some of the finest storytelling McMurtry has ever put across. <br /> <br />As I said, happy endings depend on where you stop your story.  Fans of \\"Dove\\" and Call and Clara and Pea Eye and Lorena may well wish to stop with that book's ending, rather than wander into this terrain, which is harsh and unforgiving and, for some characters, final.	2005-08-14

But, then again, I'm one of those jerks this was apparently written for.     It's safe to assume a pair of rock snobs also wrote it.  Only a rock snob could write, and appreciate, entries such as:    \\"Drake, Nick: ... Was frequently photographed standing dolefully among trees....\\"    \\"Eno, Brian: Egghead producer and electronics whiz with appropriately futuristic name and aerodynamic pate.\\"    \\"Big Star: ... recorded tunes that, while catchy, were too fraught with druggy tension to be commercial -- thereby guaranteeing the group posthumous 'great overlooked band status.'\\"     \\"Albini, Steve: Self-consciously difficult Chicago-based producer who... pushes the bounds of rock iconoclasm by wearing glasses and having short hair.\\"     \\"Parsons, Gram: Southern, Harvard educated, trustafarian pretty boy who invented country-rock....\\"    It's slim, it's amusing, and sometimes surprising.

Not me.	2005-07-04

This is an utterly fantastic book and it's many different things - it's an insightful profile of the World's Greatest Rock n' Roll Band at their absolute peak; it's a look at the dark core of the 1960s as viewed through the lens of the Stones' 1969 tour; in alternating chapters, it covers the history of the group; and it's also a very literary, deftly-written piece of American writing.<br /><br />This, basically, is the book version of \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"  You can even spot Booth in that movie (he's shaking his tail in the hotel room during the \\"Brown Sugar\\" sequence and gets startled by one of the Maysles taking a light reading).<br /><br />Booth weaves a fascinating mosaic from disparate threads: recording sessions; TV appearances; rehearsals; individual shows; hotel rooms and airports; cramped back seats and back stages and, finally, the Baconian nightmare of Altamont.<br /><br />Booth also captures a cast of characters with the perceptive edge of a great journalist: B.B. King, Gram Parsons, Chuck Berry, the individual Stones and their women and handlers and bodyguards and leeches.  But, surprisingly, the most important characters are the kids who show up to hear the band play, and Booth himself - a mercurial, sometimes abrasive guy who, nevertheless, doesn't let himself off the hook one bit.  He's not afraid to portray himself as less than likeable, less than loved.<br /><br />If you're interested in the Rolling Stones, or just want to read a fine book about rock 'n roll and America, this is your card.	2005-03-18

Two of my favorite contemporary writers have died unexpectedly in the past few months - the Mississippi writer Larry Brown and, more recently, Hunter S. Thompson, who committed suicide on Feb. 20.     Both were deaths that affected me greatly.  Usually when I hear of a notable passing, my reaction is, \\"Oh, no,\\" but in both of these cases my first thought was to hope that the news wasn't true.      In the days following Thompson's death, I found myself going over some of his work - a documentary on the Criterion \\"Fear & Loathing\\" DVD, \\"The Great Shark Hunt\\" and \\"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas.\\"     But the book that I found myself reading the most, and finding a kind of solace in, is this one: Thompson's collected letters from 1968-76.    I used to work in a bookstore and there was always a question of where \\"Las Vegas\\" belonged.  It obviously wasn't fiction but it also couldn't be entirely true, and that's part of its genius.  But with \\"The Gonzo Letters, Volume II\\" there is no doubt that this is the genuine article, this is probably the closest look we'll get at what Thompson was like.  The sheer fact that he wrote and saved so many letters in the first place tells you a lot about the man himself.    The correspondence here runs the gamut: letters to Oscar Acosta, Tom Wolfe, Charles Kuralt, William Kennedy, Jann Wenner, his brother, his mother, his broker and anybody he had a beef with.  The letters take us through his early ups and downs, his campaign for sheriff of Pitkin County and we not only get to follow him through the success of \\"Las Vegas,\\" but also part of the process of him refining surrealism and colorful exaggeration into the style he'd use in that book.     And tucked away in the book, on page 181 is a letter that gave me a smile and a shiver of sadness as I read it with the news playing in the background on TV.  It's a May 19, 1969 letter to the Disabled American Veterans Association, in response to a solicitation for a donation.  Thompson opposed thethen-raging war in Vietnam and was flabbergasted that the DAV would support it.  His reply is so fierce and funny and sad that it even stung me, a bystander, 35 years later.	2005-03-04
US	43623406	R1PF0XOTZ6CL6J	0671020641	99455039	Comanche Moon (Lonesome Dove Story, Book 2)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	"Bible and sword!"	This is kind of a mixed bag and if you view the Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Lonesome Dove\\" as sacrosanct, you'll probably want to avoid it.  But if you just want to spend a little more time with Gus, Call, Deets, Jake Spoon, Blue Duck and my favorite character, the Kickapoo tracker Famous Shoes, then prepare to kick back for a while.    \\"Comanche Moon\\" has two things working against it right off the bat.  First of all, it falls chronologically between two better known novels and it's straight-jacketed by the fact that we already know very well what happens to most of the characters.  That limits the ability of what McMurtry can do and while it makes, say, Jake Spoon's boyhood actions more poignant because we know where he eventually ends up, it also means that when Blue Duck wades in to fight a duel to the death with a sworn enemy, we know what *won't* happen, because we know Blue's fate, too.      Plus, it extends one of my least favorite aspects of \\"Lonesome Dove\\" (Call's tedious and inexplicable disavowal of Maggie and Newt) and since we already know he never claims her as a wife or Newt as a son, a boring issue becomes even more frustrating.      The other problem is that the novel is broken into three parts, or \\"books.\\"  The first establishes Call and Gus in their 30s, patrolling the llano under Capt. Inish Scull and becoming captains themselves.  The second covers the Comanches' raid to the sea and Scull's bloody battle of wills with Ahumado, the Black Vaquero.  And the third closes the gap and points the way to the opening of \\"Lonesome Dove.\\"      The reason this is a problem is that Scull's \\"Book II\\" struggle against Ahumado is the most interesting part of the story and because of this \\"Book III\\" feels like it arrives in the wake of a blown load.  McMurtry skims through the Civil War and the rangers' approach to middle age, and as much as I like the characters, it feels a bit anticlimactic.    Nevertheless, it's a worthy entry to the series (and, if McMurtry isstill in the mood to write about any of these characters, I seriously would love to see a book solely devoted to Scull or Mr. Shoes).  After I finished \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" I was still in the mindset of these books and plunged right into \\"Comanche.\\"  By the time I finished \\"Comanche,\\" I realized I'd absorbed over 1600 pages of this material -- no wonder McMurtry sometimes loses track of where Clara is when or how Maggie lived before she died.  Sixteen hundred pages and I have half a mind to start on into re-reading \\"Streets of Laredo.\\"       There's just something fascinating to me about McMurtry's matter-of-fact prose and his plain-phrased approach to the country, violence, sex, horse maintenance, Native Americans (who are presented with respect but without faux-varnish) and just the day-to-day process of living in the 1800's and getting yourself from point A to point B in an age before accurate maps, cell phones, interstates and cruise control.	2005-02-26

Knopf imprint.<br /><br />People tend to either know exactly who he is or have no idea, but Kidd's the guy who did the T-Rex for the cover of \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  He also did landmark jackets like Tartt's \\"The Secret History\\" ; Cormac McCarthy's border trilogy (\\"All the Pretty Horses\\"); the reverse canvas of Robert Hughes' \\"Nothing if Not Critical\\" ; Martin Amis' big paycheck \\"The Information\\" ; the evocative Elmore Leonard and James Ellroy covers; and the stark, bloodstained Richmond Lattimore translation of the New Testament.<br /><br />The book also touches on Kidd's novel, \\"The Cheese Monkeys,\\" and his books about \\"Peanuts\\" and \\"Plastic Man\\" and his surprisingly absorbing books on \\"Batman\\" memorabilia.<br /><br />Vienne's introduction - a little under 18 illustrated pages - provides a solid mix of biographical and technical information and the pictures, though somewhat reduced, are still large enough to appreciate.<br /><br />The notes are also insightful.  For some reason, I'd never really identified Kidd's tendency toward covers with a horizontal split; I also wasn't aware that he'd godfathered (though not designed) the jacket of Chris Ware's \\"Jimmy Corrigan,\\" and was amused to learn the story behind the cover of Edmund White's bio of Jean Genet (Kidd found the signed photograph of Genet in an East Hampton bookstore but couldn't afford its $3,000 pricetag so he rented it; in route to his office, the glass over the photo cracked and Kidd kept the pane with the starburst crack rather than replacing it with a new one).<br /><br />Overall, an engrossing look at a guy whom I know mostly through his art which, ironically, almost always adorns the art of others.	2005-02-20

Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights,\\" \\"Magnolia\\"), Spike Jonze (\\"Being John Malkovich\\"), David O. Russell (\\"Three Kings\\"), David Fincher (\\"Fight Club\\") and Steven Soderbergh (\\"Traffic\\").   <br /> <br />They're a mixed bag of personalities and Waxman tells their stories with detail and relish, and also touches on other interesting filmmakers such as Wes Anderson, Roger Avary, Charlie Kaufman, Alexander Payne and others (though some are conspicuously absent -- Spike Lee and especially Richard Linklater, who isn't even mentioned). <br /> <br />It's hard to miss with a collection of stories like this: Tarantino's rise to power; Hackman cursing Wes Anderson on the set of \\"Tenenbaums\\"; Avary's attempts to buy a famous French film studio; Russell headbutting George Clooney on the set of \\"Kings\\" and P.T. Anderson admitting that \\"Magnolia\\" was probably too long. <br /> <br />\\"Rebels\\" (very deliberately) rises to the same sordid, \\"print the legend\\" heights as Biskind's \\"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.\\"  But it also suffers from some of the same weaknesses - occasionally questionable accounts; some poor copy editing and more than a few awkward sentences that feel like they were written the Sunday night before the term paper was due: \\"Traffic\\" screenwriter Stephen Gaghan's high school drug problems are introduced twice in three pages; Wes Anderson's debut was \\"Bottle Rocket\\" not \\"Rushmore\\"; and what can one say about lines such as, \\"Soderbergh questioned his own questioning\\" and \\"The director kept the obituary about his father printed in the local paper framed in his office in Los Angeles\\" ?  Waxman also has a strange storytelling habit of explaining the results of a situation, then backtracking once or twice to tell the circumstances that led to the results.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it is absolutely impossible to deny the appeal of this book, and it was equally impossible for me to put the damn thing down for the past week.   <br /> <br />	2005-01-25

This may be my favorite of the books (though trying to pick a favorite \\"Sin City\\" yarn is like trying to select a favorite Beatles album).  It encapsulates everything I like about Miller's work: beautiful black-and-white illustrations with an emphasis on venetian blinds; cigarette smoke; shattered glass and dangerous curves; twisty storylines that pop in on one another; hot mamas and serious ultraviolence.      Plus, it contains my favorite moment in the entire series: Dwight, shot and seriously wounded by the murderous harlot he loved, is being raced away from a crime scene by Marv (who has a nice supporting role here).  Marv says Dwight won't survive unless they get to the nearest hospital; Dwight, a bloody mess, insists on being taken somewhere further away and delivers the line of dialogue that best sums up the ethos of \\"Sin City\\" : \\"I'll make it.  I won't die. I've got too much I have to do to let myself die.\\"  Sweet.	2005-01-22

The task undertaken in the novel, and the slow but steady progress of the characters, seemed to reflect my own endeavors.   <br /> <br />It's quite a satisfying experience.  The great McMurtry takes what could've been a closetful of cliches and turns them on end.  Heroine Lorena isn't some Grace Kelly figure but a pragmatic manipulator who's likeable because McMurtry paints her honestly; the same goes for Clara, Jake, Dish, Po, Newt (though, admittedly, he winds up separated from the group a couple times too many) and even Blue Duck. <br /> <br />In terms of iconic characters, Gus and Call are basically the cut-up and the straight man, but they're also remarkably complex and I enjoyed the fact that, although the old Rangers didn't have a name for it then, the cattle drive is basically the result of their mid-life crises. <br /> <br />Ironically, the engine that drives \\"Dove\\" is the way the actions of men and women in an underpopulated land affect one another: Jake's actions affect July; July's affect Elmira and, in turn, Roscoe; and, most importantly, Call's decision to move the herd North affects everybody in the story.  \\"I guess in New York there are so many people you don't notice the dying so much,\\" says Clara. \\"Out here it shows more when people go....\\"  <br /> <br />Of course, characters affect each other in every story but here the reactions are as clearly drawn as falling dominos, particularly in light of the novel's oft-repeated refrain, \\"Things would've been a lot better if we'd stayed in Texas.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Dove\\" doesn't have the jolting brutality and arresting darkness of \\"Streets\\" or \\"Moon\\" (both of which I thought were great and beautifully downbeat) but it's brilliant and has some excellent moments (the fight between the bull and the bear; Gus' tussle with Blue Duck's thugs; a hanging and, much later, a funeral for one of my favorite characters that moved me more than anything I read all year.  \\"Lonesome Dove\\" also has the wit and lyricism and episodic brilliance of a true classic.	2005-01-10

An early Rolling Stone profile of R.E.M., for example, once mentioned that Peter Buck was buying a copy of a book by Jim Carroll, which pointed me the way to \\"The Basketball Diaries,\\" a book that warped my then-young mind like a breath of fresh airplane glue.    I'm also a big fan of Nick Hornby's writing, so \\"The Polysyllabic Spree\\" is double the pleasure for me because it's a series of articles he wrote for \\"The Believer,\\" chronicling his reading habits for the better part of a year.    In his typical conversational style, Hornby simply lays out his likes and dislikes, offering the reader potential listings for their own reading lists.      I'm an avid but severely undisciplined reader and was heartened to read that even a bestselling author sometimes sets aside a great novel in favor of a football game.      Just as \\"Songbook\\" was Hornby's meditation on music and life and living, \\"The Polysyllabic Spree\\" is a quick (I would contend *too* quick) and friendly tour of his bookshelf. It's also one that's rich enough to make the reader wish he'd go on and wax rhapsodic about, for example, what movies he's into these days or what TV shows he's digging -- that's the mark of a truly apt critic and writer.	2004-12-12

I had it with me in a computer class I took (the class used TRS-80s, to put it in chronological perspective) and I distinctly remember my twentysomething teacher asking, \\"Isn't that a little... mature for you?\\"  I said, \\"Nah.\\"    When I was 18, I reread it but I might as well have been reading it for the first time.  The sexual references made a lot more sense and I had to laugh at the memory of my pre-teen self carting \\"Garp\\" around to summer school with me.  The final section, though, was no laughing matter and I distinctly remember being utterly moved to discover the fates of all the characters.     I read it again at 25 and, once again, it seemed like a new book to me -- Garp's marriage, his fear for his children, his mother's perspectives, all struck closer to home for me.      Somebody gave me a copy of the book on tape when I was about to start a long drive at 28, and Irving's introduction is wonderful but the voice of the reader felt so abrasive I couldn't listen to more than a few minutes of it.    Now I'm 34 (roughly the same age Irving was when he published \\"Garp\\") and I feel like dipping back into it one more time.  I'm looking forward to seeing what works for me, what doesn't work, and what works in different ways.  And it'll be good to hang out with Garp again.	2004-12-09

Sure, but excellent and capable of standing on its own	OK, the rap I'd always heard was that Francis Ford Coppola took a lurid pulp epic and buffed it with wax and shoe polish till he turned it into a cinematic Faberge egg.  And... that's pretty much correct. <br /> <br />But that analogy also completely limits the novel \\"The Godfather,\\" which is so much better than I ever expected it to be. <br /> <br />Here's a better analogy: if the first two movies are perfectly constructed sonnets, Puzo's novel is a \\"Prufrock\\"-esque epic, a noir \\"Howl\\" that is basically just one wild story after story after story after story.  If you've seen the movie, you know the characters.  But this is kind of like walking into the film and getting to find out the backstory of everybody... and I mean EVERYBODY.  Much of the flashbacks that appear in \\"Godfather II\\" are here, too. <br /> <br />Puzo's style is way less restrained than Coppola's.  What Coppola hints at, Puzo raises right up into your nose and the experience is a different one than fans might be used to, but no less fascinating.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the only thing that really wore against me as I read it was the constant return to Don Corleone's purity of character and sense of purpose.  The word count devoted to boasts of the Don's superhuman shrewdness and his infalible power could form a novella.  They're like a drum that the author beats from Chapter One to \\"The End,\\" but eventually I realized that they constitute its heartbeat.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

MacDonald's salvage consultant goes to New York City to help out the kid sister of an old friend.  She's a babe, of course, and McGee helps her unravel a complicated financial scam while curing what ails her with some of his own, patented expert hay rolling.<br />Along the way, he makes a major error and winds up trapped in a crooked mental hospital straight out of \\"Shock Corridor\\" but with nurses delivering doses of refried LSD and brain melting sedatives.  <br />This is a creepy installment.  An early rant by MacDonald, about how one day a minor altercation on the streets of New York will lead to a riot that will wipe out the city, sets the tone; things get really nasty when Trav slips and falls into the clutches of the scheming Dr. Varn -- I don't think MacDonald was much of a recreational drug user but his descriptions of the wrong kind of hallucinations do a good of depicting a bad trip. <br />Before McGee escapes, some pretty terrible things happen to him; he also has to resort to some seriously dirty tricks and, by the end, he's a basket case.  This being only the second outing by McGee, it's odd to think that MacDonald would bang up his tough guy hero so badly, so early.  Which makes \\"Nightmare in Pink\\" a great, chilling read but probably not the best place for a new reader to begin.	2004-07-18

Trav's confrontations with a prissy ski instructor; a pair of menacing, trailer park lesbians; and a spookily rendered German trophy wife may not be politically correct but they typify what's best and occasionally worst about MacDonald's style.  McGee's warnings about women who kick for the crotch chafe against political correctness but make for one hilarious scene.<br />The first time I read it, I was pleased at how aburptly MacDonald wraps this one up.  On a second reading, I thought perhaps it was a little anticlimactic but, in re-evaluating it, \\"Fox\\" ends economically and with a surpirsing level of sad tenderness.  A good starting point for the uninitiated.	2004-07-18

I have Hemingway that's unread; I have Mailer and Faulkner that continually remains uncracked; and I've been meaning to tackle &quot;The Corrections&quot; forfreakingever.  And yet... I can't help it, there's something about sun-bleached days and cricket-filled nights that lends itself incredibly well to this series.  <br />This is definitely one of the best of the McGee adventures.  Trav and Meyer run afoul of backwoods law enforcement and McGee spends the rest of the book stripping away layers of vicious, small-town corruption with the admirable ease of a man peeling a banana.<br />All the great MacDonald hallmarks are here: there's a surprising amount of eroticism, several tense face-offs and twists and turns, some slick legal manuvering, a couple of pretty scary discoveries and a cast of cool characters: the top-heavy, man-hungry waitress Betty; a pill-popping psycho with a badge and a prostitution ring; and, best of all, a crazed, superhumanly strong, swamp-bred superbabe who likes to lift up Pintos and coo in womens' ears when she's torturing them.  Added to which is a great ending, plus a nice vacation from the nautical details and dense business technicalities which are staples of the series but which, as proven here, don't have to be on full display every time around.	2004-07-08

A beautiful and enlightening book	I became acquainted with Tintin in second grade, when I discovered a shelf of Children's Digests which ran abridged, black-and-white excerpts of his adventures.  The digests were in no particular order, so I found myself reading, for example, a few pages of \\"The Black Island,\\" then a smattering of \\"Tintin in the Picaros\\" followed by the ending of \\"Cigars of the Pharaohs.\\"  <br />It didn't matter that the bits were all out of sequence and context, I loved Herge's characters and stories.  Recently, a couple of decades later, I started recollecting the complete Tintin adventures and stumbled onto \\"The Tintin Companion\\" in a local bookstore.  It was shrinkwrapped but I took a chance and bought it anyway.  <br />It was definitely worth it.  This book gives a great history of Herge and his career and work.  It also goes into detail about each of the stories and the inspirations behind the illustrations.  <br />An extremely beautiful, enlightening, well-put-together book.  Fans will love it.	2004-06-19

Sometimes I wish my absolute favorite album could be something a little prettier, a little more melodic like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot; or &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; or &quot;The Band&quot; or &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; And all those *are* extremely high up there.  <br />But the bottom line is, if I were being shot into space tomorrow and could only bring one album with me, I wouldn't even have to think about it, it would be &quot;Exile.&quot;  I might consider &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; for a second but then I'd think, &quot;I'm going into space, I have to have 'Shine a Light' with me!&quot;  &quot;Exile&quot; has been the background music for so many drives and so many sitting around evenings, so many hours of my life, and it's never gotten old, I never seem to tire of it or stop hearing new things in it.  <br />I'm going to get to the book itself in a second but here's something I found while Googling yesterday.  The late, great critic, Lester Bangs wrote this about the album: &quot;Exile is dense enough to be compulsive: hard to hear at first, the precision and fury behind the murk ensure that you'll come back hearing more with each playing. What you hear sooner or later is two things: an institution for nonstop getdown... and a strange kind of humility and love emerging from a dazed frenzy.&quot;<br />That's it.  He nailed it.  And writer John Perry does a good job of digging behind the murk with his examination of the album.  He's clearly a big time fan of the music and shares a lot of insight into it with a track-by-track analysis.  Most importantly, the book also includes contemporary magazine reviews of the album that ran when it first came out.  Since &quot;Exile&quot; is an album that almost has to grow on a listener to some extent, some of the conclusions the writers make are amusing to say the least.He also includes essays about the album and a little history.<br />The book isn't perfect -- Perry is interesting but he doesn't have a dead-serious critical edge, and I really wish the publishers had had access to better archive pictures and better reproduction.  But this is still a good book to have if you want a better understanding of one of the greatest pieces of pop culture ever created.  It even pointing out a snore (presumably Keith's) which I'd never heard before.	2004-03-21

Brown is a master at getting you hooked into one story, then shifting to another one that gradually becomes just as engrossing.  He also creates characters that are deeply flawed but surprisingly sympathetic: case in point -- Domino D'Alamo, a dope-dealing, cop-killing no good who will stop at nothing to accomplish his goal (basically \\"deliver the weed and get paid.\\")  Despite his Tuco-esque flaws, I kept catching myself rooting for him.  And in his last scene, when his ridiculous but terrible fate is revealed, I genuinely felt sad. <br />The usual Brown trademarks are here -- perfectly crafted scenes that look deceptively easy; vivid depictions of men and women and land and violent activity; Brown's obsessions with and depictions of drinking, smoking, money, sex and food.  And yet the book also finds the author going in a few different directions, as well, writing about people and places that don't ordinarily wind up in his fiction.<br />The book isn't perfect.  It's a little indulgent and some strands feel incomplete; some of the characters fare better than others -- I never really got too interested in the adventures of college professor Merlot and his law enforcement squeeze Penelope, and I wondered if it was really necessary for Anjalee *and* Helen *and* Miss Muffet to be such man-hunting barflies. <br />But overall, it's a series of compelling stories and it's good to be back with Brown's kooky brokenhearts and badasses, and to see a great writer branching off into new territories -- whom among his fans would've thought a whale would enter into one of his tales?	2004-02-21

They establish a set of foolproof rules and make out like the proverbial bandits, stashing their loot under the sink and spending it on hysterically rendered period clothes, cars and stereos. Things go great until, of course, they begin to violate their own guidelines.<br />Fast, funny, violent, gritty, sexy and chock full of Leonard's trademark dialogue and twisty turns, this book skims along like a Tarantino movie writ long before Tarantino came about.<br />I'm a huge Elmore Leonard fan and this is my favorite of his books.  I can't believe it's not more popular, can't believe it's actually OUT OF PRINT.  Track it down used if you can, it's a true unheralded modern classic.	2004-02-07

When Peter Biskind's \\"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\\" came out, I spent almost a week with my nose buried in it.  Its stories about the great filmmakers of the 60's and 70's were thoroughly captivating, endlessly entertaining and (as with the best gossip) occasionally a bit questionable.  <br />So when I heard Biskind was working on a follow-up, to focus on the indie film era of the late 80's and 90's, I was all down with that.<br />One could, potentially, write 10,000 pages on the subject.  So Biskind focuses his gaze to concentrate mostly on Sundance and Miramax, the Weinstein's and their colleagues (Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Billy Bob Thornton, Matt and Ben). <br />There's a lot of surprising stuff here.  And, unlike with \\"Easy Riders,\\" it's not stuff that happened decades ago.  It's backstories from recent movies, some of which are thoroughly astonishing.  <br />While that scaled-back approach gives the book a more wieldy structure, it also leaves one hungry for more information on, say, the Coen Brothers, Wes and P.T. Anderson, Richard Linklater, Spike Lee, Jim Jarmusch, et al.  John Pierson's \\"Spike, Mike, Slackers and Dykes\\" covered a lot of that territory, but still... I'm disappointed Biskind doesn't dig deeper into the production and lore of, say, \\"Boogie Nights\\" or \\"Magnolia\\" or \\"Dazed and Confused.\\"  <br />Meanwhile, he loads on the details of the economic aspects of the business, but in such a fast and loose way it's occasionally confusing.  For a book with a footnote that explains a simple term like \\"turnaround,\\" it's frequently, surprisingly opaque with the numbers and the ins-and-outs of complicated deals.<br />Nevertheless: Good book, kept me riveted for a few days, it's just a shame Biskind couldn't cram as much detail between the covers as he did with \\"Easy Riders.\\"	2004-01-11

US	43623406	R360FPYD7AURSV	0971904774	687876775	Songbook	Books	4	49	50	N	Y	my awesome mix tape #38	I bought this book, sight unseen, simply because of the description, which was: Nick Hornby, one of my favorite writers, had written a book about a bunch of his favorite songs.  That's all I needed to know, that sounded great to me, I was sold.<br />I've been a Hornby fan since Fever Pitch.  When High Fidelity (the book) came out, I was amazed: it felt like Hornby had been eavesdropping on my mind, because I tend to agree with a lot of his opinions about music and music lovers.  Similarly, I'm a big fan of the reviews he wrote for The New Yorker a few years ago.<br />So I ordered the book and it showed up in my box and I immediately turned to the table of contents to see: which songs did he write about???  And I was surprised, and a bit disappointed, to see that I only recognized about a dozen of the titles.  And there wasn't one song in the bunch that I considered a personal favorite.  And when I listened to the songs I didn't know (included on a handy-dandy CD)... they didn't blow me away.  But that's the beauty of a mix tape and, despite the fact that it's printed on paper, this is a mix tape.  <br />And this one comes with great liner notes. Hornby's a smart, entertaining, intuitive writer.  I may sound like a disappointed fan trying to make the best of a book that didn't satisfy me 100%, but even when Hornby's writing about music I haven't heard, it's still enjoyable, it's still worthwhile, it's still exposing me to things I previously didn't know about.  <br />Even when he's confessing to not being a huge Dylan fan and confesses to preferring a Rod Stewart cover of one of my favorite Dylan songs to the original (which is, of course, the true road to enternal damnation), he does so in a way that's completely relatable even to a Dylan fanatic.  <br />Even when he's extolling the virtues of a song I find to be \\"sad bastard\\" music (like he does in his essay about Mark Mulcahy's \\"Hey Self Defeater\\") he manages to include a great, conversational subtext about the virtues of small, privately owned, slowly-becomming-extinct record stores with a personal touch.<br />This is also a beautifully designed McSweeny book, with a beautiful \\"Maxell XL-II\\" mix-tape cover and with clever illustrations by Marcel Dzama. The book also benefits Treehouse Trust and 826 Valencia, organizations that are extremely worthy of the extra money.  <br />Hornby should do one of these a year, I think.  And next time, it'd be nice if he'd touch on his favorite Stones songs, his favorite Stax songs, his favorite Steve Earle songs, his favorite blues, his favorite jazz, his favorite Clash songs, etc, etc.  If he'll write it, I'll read it.	2003-01-28

That book ends, unfortunately, in the 80's and, thus, can't offer perspective on everything that came since; but it's chronicling of the early days and it's portrait of Lorne Michaels is much more detailed and probably more honest.<br />NEVERTHELESS... with &quot;Live From New York,&quot; Tom Shales &amp; J.A.

I was still flipping through the pages, experiencing a rush of mid-70's childhood flashbacks.<br />This book has page after page of crisp photographs of just about every \\"Star Wars\\" toy you can think of, plus corresponding stills from the films.  The loving care and detail dedicated to archiving these toys (which are both crude and sophisticated) remind me of Chip Kidd's books about \\"Batman\\" toys, but these pictures retain the sterile, futuristic feel of a Lucasfilm by-product.<br />I'm no longer a huge \\"Star Wars\\" fan but throughout elementary school, I was.  As I flipped through this book, so many minor characters that I'd forgotten about came back to me: IG-88, R5-D4, Bossk  -- were the toys based on the characters? or were the characters created so there'd be more toys?  <br />It doesn't matter.  I'd forgotten that when Boba Fett first appeared, you had to send away to Kenner to special order him.  I'd also forgotten that the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" Tauntaun toy had a slit in its stomach so you could stuff Luke in there, just like Han Solo did.  This book brought all that back to me.<br />If you're a lapsed \\"Star Wars\\" fan, jaded by the hype and the cheesy digital graphics of the current sequels, look around for this book and kick back when you have a lot of time on your hands.  You might find huge sections of your youth buried in here, disguised as a remote-control Landspeeder.	2002-05-06

And every time, I am pleased to find that it's as good as I remember.  <br />The first time I read \\"Joe,\\" I had just discovered \\"Big Bad Love\\" and I could not wait to read more Larry Brown.  But whereas the previous collection of stories had humor and pathos and sad comedy in heaping portions, this is a book about dark places.  The first book written after Brown had achieved his much-sought-after degree of success did not seem to find him in a pleasant mood.  Relocate James Ellroy in the South and lengthen his machinegun sentences into paragraphs.  Contemporize Cormac McCarthy.  That's kind of what this book is like.  <br />The Joe of the title is a man of questionable morals and steeped in prejudices that seem like self-fulfilling prophecies.  He posions trees for a lumber company for a living, and then when the seasons change he plants new ones.  He has more money and can kick more (...) than anybody around him and those factors make him despise almost everyone, including himself.  Following him as he tries to create some good in the world is heart-wrenching and by no means sentimental.  <br />I hope they never adapt this novel into a film.  The prose and characterizations are so rich that they produce a movie in your head that is crystal clear and downright flawless.	2002-02-26
