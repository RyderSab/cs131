Silken Savage is one of the best historical romance books I've read this year, 1999 so far.  A Panther Stalks and Wildcat - a couple born to love.  Tanya Martin taken by force by a raid, A Panther Stalks takes her for his  own..  He drags her around by a leash, strips her of her clothes at night  so she can't escape and yet real love develops between them.  They get  married.  Tanya learns to become a good warrior and borns two sons.  The  village is taken over by the calvary and Tanya is taken back to her  parents.  Nothing will keep these two people apart.

I've ready well over 30 of her books.  But unfortunately, her new book - Lone Eagle just didn't do it for me.  The plot was week, no empathy for the  characters.  They were weak too.  I didn't enjoy reading this story about  slavery.  White man who is married to a white woman, but loves a black  slave, Ada.  He has a baby by her named Zondra.  Zondra was treated as a  slave, couldn't take on her Father's name so she runs away after her  half-brother, Guy, tries to rape her.  Yuk.. Didn't like the story line or  the characters too much.  I'd wait before you purchase this book.	1998-11-21

Iron Knife and Summer  were truly meant for each other.  But when Summer found out that Iron Knife  wasn't as faithful as she thought, their relationship began to fall apart.   Summer's mother was ill back in Boston and decided to visit with her for  the last time.  She took all three children and set out for Boston.  <br />Summer's devious father sent false messages to both Summer and Iron  Knife's friend who worked for a newspaper in Denver to try and break up  their marriage.  <br />Iron Knife took matters in his own hands.  He decided  to dress up like a white man in fine clothes and travel the trains to see  Summer in Boston.  He needed to hear from her own lips if she didn't want  him anymore like the false messages had indicated.<br />Along the way, Iron  Knife tried to save a young woman from being abused by a drunken cad, who  turned out to be the son of the wealthy man who owns most of the town.   Needless to say, Iron Knife missed the train to Boston while getting  knocked out by the Town's Sheriff and thrown in jail.<br />When Summer's  father finds out that Iron Knife was on his way to see his daughter, he  cashes in on a favor a judge owed him.  The judge sends orders to throw him  in a chain gang far away.  <br />I won't give the story away.  Read it!!  All  the characters in this book are very colorful and exciting.  Sometimes  you'll catch yourself wanting to scream at the bad guys, but then Georgina  Gentry puts all the players at work to make for a wonderful ending...	1998-10-25

You become attached to the characters, especially Joanna and  Pace.  The story proceeds well, but for a while it bothered me that Pace  can be that thoughtless, and leave on several occasions.  That Joanna had  to be the one to develop their relationship all the time.  She was the one  to follow him everywhere he disappeared to...  I would have given him up a  long time ago.  But still this book is a good read.	1998-10-04

A handsome, strong Sioux Indian rescued by a beautiful young white woman.  What's better than that?  Maddy, the caring gentle woman nurses Black Wolf to health.  They fall in love and behold a blooming romance begins.  Other than Black Wolf and Maddy, other characters like Maddy's younger sister, Jaimie, and the bad Sheriff, Ferris Boyd, didn't cause you any excitment expected from the works of Cassie Edwards.  The story tend to carry on toying with the idea &quot;should I read it now or later&quot; type attitude.  A bit disappointed, but still a good read.	1998-07-29
