It was upsetting to see a woman become self-obsessed with her weight (lost 72, gained 72 throughout the year) and will do anything to get her thigh circumfrance down 1.5 centimetres.  However, her humerous whining makes me forgive Fielding. <br />Her witty charm about being a Singleton and then being together with someone which is only doomed to fail.  Her illicit affair with her boss and her non-existant black skirt, her drinking and eating binges and her mother all sum up the life of a woman who will never please herself.  Just when something good happens to Bridget, her mother, a break-up or her inability to set the VCR comes crashing down her. <br />This is a book that woman can read and appreciate wether single, divorced or happily coupled with someone.	2004-08-27

Ashley MacIsaac was raw, edgy and above all truthful when re-telling his life.  A book that is the best autobiography I have ever read.<BR>If you know who Ashley MacIsaac is, what is the first thing that comes to mind?  Fiddler, gay, crack addict, and East Coast.  Chances are you thought of all four.  Mr. MacIsaac does not dispute any of these and at long last was able to have his say on his life.  A poignant look at his life, his way.  <BR>His thoughts on fame by 18, being the first to break the East Coast music mold, MacLeans crashed and burned his 'high' by plastering across the country he was gay.  He discusses in depth how this made him and how he dealt with it.<BR>His book is very prolific and tells everything about him in a realstic yet controversial in some ways, too.  He admits to disliking to do most shows he does but that he relished every show he did pre-fame with hi how are you today.  <BR>Many people will read this and probably still think he is a nutcase but I still beleive he is an incredible musician.  No one can ever dispute that.  He put East Coast Music on the map and made it 'cool' and he has fused the fiddle and rave music together . . . something no one has ever done before, and probably never will.  The drugs made Ashley destitute but it was the music that lifted him above it, and put him back on track.  <BR>Want to know the real Ashley MacIsaac, the one outside the media?  Read this book, it may just change your mind.	2003-09-10

Not written in the voice of Mrs. Thang, Paul does justice to the hardship and creative renewshal she faced time and time again.  The truth comes from those who know Alanis best: herself, parents, friends, managers and band members.  <BR>Broken up into sections, Fate Stay With Me and Head Over Feet, the book discusses her time as the pop princess of (Ottawa) Canada, her failed years and triumphant return with Jagged Little Pill.  The myths of her life are demystified and the rumours justified or denied (like the ever famous who was All I Really Want really about?)  <BR>You Oughta Know is written -in half- by Alanis Morissette, a very candid book much like the prolificness of her lyrics.  A worthwhile read for the fan to learn about her rare second chance.	2003-07-01

Harry, Ron and Hermione do come through with great advernture and fun and make for a fabulous fifth book.<BR>It is fifth year and the pressures lay heavily on our famous trio to make good in their OWLs and the secret society we hear about within the first four chapters.  (I don't want to ruin any surprises for those not yet read it).  Harry, kept well away from any plans over the summer, soon realizes that the wizarding world is having serious problems.  Dementors are back and as we know from book four, so is You-Know-Who.   I was surprised in how Rowling first placed the Dementors in the book, a definite twist.<BR>Harry, Ron and Hermione all into adventure immediatly leading us to evils, new friends, wonderings and of course, a New Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.  The new teacher is not accepted by anybody, not even the teachers which puts strain on all of Hogwarts.  And, poor Dumbledore is beside himself since the Ministry goes out of its way to believe him or anybody else.<BR>Harry is also starting to grow up and act more like a teenager.  Moodiness, emotional growth and more defiance against authority.  Plus, poor Harry Potter has to take extra classes; and with Snape, at that.  We are also re-introduced to (new) characters and old ones garner more attention and admiration from readers.  At least Neville Longbottom got more admiration from me.<BR>A great read leaving you for the outcomes of OWLs and more adventure from our favourite trio.	2003-07-01

The novel moved to a top selling spot.  The book is better than screen version could ever live up to.<br />A poor, dejected boy, Harry Potter, lives in 'the cupboard under the stairs' with his Aunt, Uncle and wretched cousin.  Unknown to Harry, he was born to famous parents and he possess many powers he knows nothing about.  Hair growing back, speaking to snakes, making things appear are only a few unexplainable things we are described.

Everything seems perfect for Harry, he's gone from his horrible family and he starts learning about his parents.  However, not everything is perfect.  Who is after Harry?

Black Like Me takes John Howard Griffen's life  and puts it in an inthralling and delicious true novel.  An unbeliecable tale that is inpredictable in nature and thought.<BR>John Howard Griffen was born a white man.  In the late 50's he darkened his skin through the use of creams, sun and medication to become a black man.  During this extremly scornful and racist filled society, what was Griffin's thought process for this life-altering change, albeit a short one?  To see how the segregated black man lived, communicated and were treated.  But, most of all, he wanted to know the truths and the false accusations placed upon 'their people'.  <BR>What John Howard Griffin found was more than a group of people who were treated unfairly; he found people treated disrespectfully and with unjust fear.  Above all, Griffin found a community of people who understood one another with a smile, touch or with few words spoken.  As Griffin explained, it is obvious that a black man is deeply changed inwardly when subjected to conditions as the ones he lived in.<BR>Griffin chose the most southernly places in which to reside, as the Southern blacks were treated the worse.  Griffin wanted to get to know the culture and later referred to himself as mulatto.  <BR>His writings posess great tragedy, heart, horror and happiness.  To have done this was very brave.  Something that many more persons should have done.  The horridness of then American democracy  was clearly shown.  It takes a brave man to do what Griffin did.  He speaks of the squalor with such despise and love.  What you read, you wish was unreal and was a piece of fiction.  Although we do not 'see' segregation today, this is a chilling book making the reader look at people differently and with due respect.	2003-04-09

Perhaps some of it is autobiographical . . . Cronin is deeply in love with the story, it is told with such affection for each character.  The young boy grew up through out the British isles he, Laurence Carrroll, meets some very engaging persons.  Terence, the dashing swindling cousin; Pin the teacher; Nora, his second love and cousin.  His mother is Laurie's first love, pushing him in all sorts of things, with great admiration for it all.<BR>Miss. Greville, is the most interesting and astonishing of all.  Upon Laurence and his mother losing their house, Miss. Greville takes them in.  With Miss. Greville's lunatice antics and empty promises coupled with some of the most enthralling experiences, Laurence becomes infatuated with everything she has to teach him.  <BR>The story grasps you immediatly when Laurence and the reader experience two very disheartening deaths and he is moved shortly thereafter to live with his odd Uncle Leo.  Experience the game of cricket and a summer of botany he begins to love himself and the world.  <BR>A Song of Sixpence was not what I expected.  I was expecting a parody or an advanced version of the classic poem but it was neither.  In fact, nothing of the nursery rhyme was mentioned.  Clever, indeed!  Although Cronin never wrote about pockets full of rye or black birds, Cronin's tales is just as silly and engaging as one could imagine!!	2003-01-23

Jane Pittman is unsurpassed as a storyteller; this book is adapted from the oral dictation of a slave born before the civil war all the way through the 1960s to when blacks were gaining some respect.  <BR>This is an elaborate book starting at when Jane is serving water to different sets of soldiers.  Her continual albeit fake admiration of the white men and woman is incredible.  I could not imagine faking my way through life of liking persons.  Her story tells us of how it was like to be hated, beated, tortured and given no respect whatsoever.  It makes one wonder in awe how the world has cometo be.<BR>Her story is poignant and mesmerizing.  She speaks of how her life as slave was . . . how she was 'married' and bore her children.  What amazes me most, is how she never lost her dream of becoming free; of never losing respect for 'the white people'.  After all they did to her and her people, she never hated them.  Jane Pittman felt this was her life, and God was going to do what he felt was right.  What an incredible, selfless way to live!!<BR>However true this book is, it seemed fake.  Fake because I've never really known such injustice and racism like Miss. Jane Pittman suffered.  This is a real book from a real woman.  With the use of the language to the stories.  For years I would start the book and it would never be completed.  I am glad I have now.  This is a book sure to be etched in persons minds forever.	2003-01-22

Rowling has not only engaged young children to read . . . on their own accord, but, has adults reading, too. The third series of Harry Potter, Prisoner of Azkaban was another enchanting book. However, I must say that some of the middle portion was weak compared to the first two, hence why only four stars. <BR>Like in the first two, Rowling puts in twists I never would have thought of. Who would have thought Sirius and Scabbers the rat would be up to something?? I do not want to reveal too much if you have not read these wonderful novels.  This book gave the reader more history on Harry and his family . . . something I was eager to know more about.<BR>Hermione got much 'page time' which was a treat. She is a wonderful character that is great for young girls to read about. I was shocked to see that she went against the ministry; good girls can be definant and turn out for the good.<BR>I look forward to the fourth book and the adventures that Harry's summer will entail.	2003-01-22

The second installment of Harry's life from Rowling is just as transforming as the last.  Never have I read a book where I could not read it; where I missed my stop on the subway.  Not once did I guess what was happening.  I thought I had figured things out and than BAM! Rowling tricks us again with another twist.<br />We meet Harry again in his house on Pivot Drive with his abonimble aunt, uncle and cousin.  As wretched as they were the first time around, we feel for Harry more so because he has just spent two completely unheard of months with these people.  This is when we meet Dobby, an engaging little house elf of the Malfoy's telling Harry not to come back to the school because of danger ahead.<br />Harry does not heed to this warning and goes to the school.  Harry finds out much more about himself, his friends, teachers and his peers.  The language is descriptive, appropriate for the age the text was originally targeted towards with a hint of adult content.<br />Rowling is imaginative and an author of perfection.  I would rank her up with Roald Dahl.	2003-01-22

The way all of the imagery and motifs molded together was fascinating.  The characterization of each character playing against one another was incredible.<br />I find it so amazing how a simple object, like the hankerchief, can represent so much; greed, love, fidelity.  Shakespeare in the best at imagery and will never be replaced.<br />The story is of Othello, a black fighter and warrior winning the heart of his one true love, Desdemona.  Through out the play, people treat Othello as a second class citizen based on his colour . . . something very rampid in the days of Shakespeare.  Iago is insanly jelous of Othello.  Iago's character (the most evil of all Shakespear's villians) was extremly sinister, from the time of deceiving Othello ot Cassio right until the very end.  At the time Iago deceive's Cassio - due to a passing up of a job promotion - we realize how poignant this part is, and the astute nature of evil; one of nature's moast prominent human characteristics.<br />The play is a story of lies, blindness and evil.  Every human suffers from blindness at some point in our life and Shakespeare executes that inevitablness perfectly.  Othello is firstmost a solider and with that, he proves to set a most enduring tragedy upon himself, the people around him and his love.	2003-01-22

Firstly, I put this book at 4.5 and although it had its fault, it was fantastic book to read.  This book was on my booklist for my fundraising course in College.  At first glance, I nievely thought, Ethics and Fundraising, a bit of an oxymoron, isn't it?  Upon closer examination of fundraising learning its craft, and reading this book, ethics and fundraising can be coupled together without any hesitation.<BR>This book described the ideologies and theories of fundraising ethics.  Upon completion, I can see that there is a distinct difference.  One I never thought possible.  Examples given are placed appropriatly and theories outlined are understood fully.<BR>So, with my praise of the book, what was wrong to garner 4/4.5 stars?  Well, the language was difficult to grasp at times.  It used jargon of the trade that someone not in a course would necessarily know.  As well, I found some of the political persons they chose to compare to fundraising as philanthropic people, strange.  <BR>Overall though, Fundraising, the fundraiser and ethics were protrayed in the most moral way with a truth love for humankind.  For people who unsure of fundraising or the hoopla that is surrounding it because of shams, this is the book.  You'll learn a lot and what is learnt, will stick with you.	2003-01-22

Written well with the usual description that Doctorow is famous for, I have to say that the synopsis made the book sound more exciting.<BR>The book details the experience that the protagonist and his family have while at the World's Fair in New York City.  From the oddities to the fun, Doctorow did his research and what was there.  Unlike his other books like Loon Lake or Welcome to Hard Times, I did not feel I was there, at the fair.  <BR>Displaying the 30s like it was, this book proves and depicts how far we have come since then.  In the primitive times of tea-line-legged nylons and T&amp;A was unheard of, historians and fans of Doctorow will be pleased.  I applaud him for his historical essence and truthfulness . . . the excitement factor just was not there.	2003-01-22

As a 22 year old Harry lover, I am more proof that Harry spills over to all ages.  The twists and turns were like none I was expecting.  Just when you think that Rowling must have used up her imagination, she spoils us again with her innovation.  The Tri-Wizard Tournament was so much fun.  I feel like that I am learning the spells along with Harry and that one day I will be able to DO them myself.  I wish there really was a Hogwart's that one could attend, even if I am a Muggle.<br />Mad-Eye Moody was great, and when Mad-Eye was not (really) around he was still in Character.  That is, when he was being impostered.  I suppose the poly-juice took on characteristics too.<br />And, Dobby was back!!!!  Winky, too, who ended up being evil - termendously exploited by Rowling's explosive words.  I love Dobby, and the things that he comes out with.  I hope that Dobby will be a central character in the later books.<br />I've read all four books and look forward to Harry starting his fifth year, more of Dobby and Sirius.  I think that him starting to take OWLS will also be an adventure in itself.<br />The forth book was a delight and I loved it.  For all Harry lovers.	2002-05-30

Although a nobel prize winner for literature wrote this, I find Morrison's books (particularly this one) to be like a riddle.  New characters were brought in, within the last few chapters.  Characters are implied but, not developed.  Some trite characters are far too developed and dealt with.  Far too many characters were thought of and brought into the book.  Morrison writes several books into one verbal dirreah novel.<br />Most common of all, characters appear, as if we are already to know them.  This bothers me greatly as if I am missing something.  However with Morrison's terrible grammer, it would not surprise me if this were true.  I do not want to think while I am reading a book, books are there to escape with, to venture to a different dimention.  With Toni's I feel stupid, and I know I am not.<br />I found 'Paradise' interesting as a story, particularly the parts containing Gigi, Mavis and Pallis.  There witty remarks were very entertaining.  The connection Ruby had with this outstanding town (until ages in, I thought Ruby was the town)!<br />I usually commend Oprah's picks and enjoy them but, Morrison, my God, just not good.  I will not be purchasing anymore of picks but I will keep the ones that I have already purchased.  I may, and that is the operative word, borrow one from the library.	2002-04-29

Don John, the bastard brother, however turned evil beneath our eyes.  At least, to mine.  Perhaps there is an imagery I did not pick up on.<br />Hero was a  delicate flower who had a quiet mischieveous maid at hand, Margaret.  Her quick evilness was a surprise, and completely expected at the same time.  It was unlike Shakespeare (at least in my readings of his plays) to have a maid be a villian.  Margaret's character intrigued me the most because of her sincerness toward Hero but, her obvious greed in regards to foil play against Hero.<br />The quadrant of love that was in the play enveloped me to read more and more.  Although Hero and Claudio were to be the hero and heroine, Beatrice and Benedick provided much more fun.  B&B play a very well matched up intellegence, humour and humanity in pale comparison to Hero and Claudio (and probably any Shakespearean duo).<br />Don Pedro, Hero and Claudio do everything in there power to bring B&B,the non willing duo to say 'I Love You' to the alter.  The plan ultimately succeeds.<br />That bastard, Don John was far more interested however, in getting Hero for himself.  So in tern, he gets Borachio to set up a 'date' between Hero and an unknown lover for Claudio to 'stumble' upon, with the help of Borachio.<br />Read this fascinating play where humour meets dark, the beginning before Shakespeare goes tragic.  The play fuses both emotions terrifically.  The play is great and is open to great conversation.	2002-04-29

I have never found Shakespeare terribly difficult to understand and this was enjoyable.<br />A play within a play, this comedy was engaging and quite different than his other comedies. This play, I found foreshadowed his latter dark comedies including Romeo and Juliet and MacBeth.<br />I liked Katherine and the way she interacted with her suitors. For a lady of that time, I found this to be very bold behaviour and brave. Bianca, a sweet thing, I pity in some respects in the way she was catered to. These two sisters no doubt has misery towards one another but also, it was obvious they had love and respect for one another. If not jelousy of each others lives.<br />The humour of the book bumped up my rating, otherwise it would be at a mere 3/3.5.

Her life, in one word was horrible.  Her father, a semi-talented violinist realizes he is not as good as he thinks he is upon hearing a virtuoso of the art.

Netochka mother kills herself, thus, leaving her orphaned. A prince takes her, and a life that was once imaginary for her, has now come to life.<BR>The pure genius and dedication Dostoyevsky puts into this work proves his unfailing love for writing.

Actually, the (entire) book seemed to be unfinished.<br />I enjoyed the parts where Golyadkin would do things and then in great fear would leave - the party for instance - or go shopping, as the reader thinks but, it is just another insane gesture on Golyadkin's character.<br />Golyadkin Senior and Juniour would see people, but these people were either not described or never heard of again. One person was even brought into the plot within the last two pages of text. It can be quite confusing and rather unpleasant; not something I like to see in a literary work.<br />It almost seems as though this was one of Dostoyevsky's first books. The mystery and intrigue were there but definetly not at his best like in 'The Gambler' or 'Netochka Nezvanova'.<br />I would put this book forth to someone who has read other Dostoyevsky books and enjoys him but, not to someone who is a first time reader.	2002-04-21

He was eccentric, bizarre and completely aliented from the world. This person, as the sex was never really identified, parallels the life of a hermit and one that I believe, so many live. He ponders his life comparing it to a toothache; speaks in great length about snow on the ground; his oddities that he embraces but loaths about himself. Sounds boring but, I assure thee, Dostoyevsky will never do that.<BR>\\"I am a sick man . . . I am a spiteful man . . . I am an unattractive man . . . I believe my liver is diseased.\\" These are the first lines of this epic tale where we are drawn into a world that really only Dostoyevsky can comprehend or fully know. The spite this man proturdes from his every orfus is doubled in amount. The protagonist despises nearly all but, has a strange sense of caring for people who dislike him.<BR>In one word, this book is incredible. The peculiar stories, engagements and encounters he faces are believable. Dostoyevsky seems to always bring out the oddity in his heros; really reflecting himself in so many ways. <BR>Dostoyevsky's incredible imagination in this book profoundly proves his exuberance for writing. I thoroughly enjoyed his self-analysis.	2002-04-20

This Marmoset is Mizt, adopted by the literary giants Virginia and Leonard Woolfe.  Through there richness, elegence and love for one another  (and Mitz) we read a book detailing the biography (life) of Mitz.  Via trips, memoirs and entries of diaries detailed by the authors in the written work.  This is a delightful little book where we find that Mitz has a personality and is not just a monkey.  <BR>It is a charming, witty fun read, well worth a second or third read.  Definetly a must for all.	2002-04-20
US	42644626	R377AJ8TTZJZ1G	0452280621	675572194	Beloved	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Confusing Love	Actually, I gave the book 3.5 stars because there were good points to this book.  'Beloved' is very confusing to read as it jumps around, however, it draws the reader in and is compelling.  As the book slowly describes everyone, each situation merges with each other opening way for an epic novel.<br />Tantilizing and scary are ways to describe Morrison's intriguing outlook on the lives of slaves.  It would have been nicer if not so many stories were twisted into one.  When I read, I prefer to drift into a netherworld, not think about what I am reading.<br />This book is good but not spectacular like so many people think.  'Beloved' is a much better read than viewing of the film disaster, however.	2002-04-20

I must admit, I thought that the book may lack, or make the musical look horrible. Luckily, neither happened.<BR>Both musical and book were adapted to one another with courage, fear, love, hate etc in the characters. Each character was described so percisley they were like family or friends by the end for the reader.<BR>The imagery expressed through Doctorow's words are plump and exotic to read. To put the cultures of white rich and black poor (it was set in times of segregation) as one proves the that Doctorow is an incredible writer. To be able to make the black persons be segregated but, seem not to be is incredible. The epic he wrote should be read by all. This literary work is a remarkable achievement.	2002-04-20

Her mother is dying of cancer but is determined to continue to do things she would normally do.  The daughter, tired of being inside the house with artwork and bugies, soon becomes friends with Jo, the keeper of the elephants.  He's a quiet, shallow man who worms his way into Sophie's effections.  <BR>A novel about love, lust, family and elephants, it is amazing to see the sameness that mammels and humans have.   I loved Saba, Keiaz and Lear, the elephants.  The elephants were not protrayed as animals but as humans with feelings and understandings.  <BR>It would be so lovely to be an owner of an elephant and feel the fingers of the trunk on your skin.  To become to understand this great beast of nature.  <BR> The majestic creatures were interpreted by Echlin through sounds and songs.  I particularly enjoyed the dictionary that she provided so that we could learn along with her.  Although we will never be able to understand an elephant, it was interesting to learn nonetheless.<BR>The relationship between Jo and Sophie was incredible, rich with agony and love.  Nearly pure love.  <BR>Read this tale for yourself and you too will fall in love with Echlin and elephants.	2002-04-20

Seeing someone from nothing to something is amazing. I felt a true interconnectedness while reading the ongoings of her life. I especially enjoyed her final entry of the book. <BR>We hear so very little of her family - besides her mother - and it was nice to know how she felt about her brothers and father. She had very honest relationships with them which urged her to be so authentic in her writing, both to music and without. <BR>A simple biography is read but, you come out knowing much more than just Jewel, the girl who came from Alaska and lived in a van.	2002-04-20

A younger rendeition of the aforementioned classics, this is a riveting, fast-packed read.  <BR>At the camp of High Pines, a revolution starts by the 'leader' of campers, in hopes of forever change.  However, General Frank, the benevolent, fearless leader turns into something far from a utilitarian dictator.  The characters are real and will relate well with the younger crowd.<BR>A quick read that is wroth many reads and that will be enjoyed by young and old a like.  I think that if you like Harry Potter and his adventures, you will also enjoy Frank and his camping adventure.	2002-04-20
