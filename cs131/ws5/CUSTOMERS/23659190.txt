A fearsome King Canute the Dane, Viking conqueror, invades. One town after another is devoured until reaching the castle of Lord Leofwine and then Godiva's hometown of Coventry. <br /> <br />Death and destruction overwhelms this northern region, while a thirteen-year old Godiva watches helplessly as the bloodthirsty invaders pillage her once peaceful world. Canute's vicious army coldly murders her parents, as well as friends. Godiva barely survives and only due to the heroism of Sister Osburga. Sister Osburga boldly draws the Vikings away from the hidden Godiva giving her the opportunity to escape. <br /> <br />Ten years pass and King Canute now controls Northern Mercia. Godiva now an exquisite woman marries the Earl of Mercia, Lord Leofric. Leofric under orders from Canute is to collect the &#34;danegeld&#34; --an exaggerated amount of taxes from the townspeople. Against the taxation Godiva implores and tries to reason with Leofric, requesting relief upon the people of Coventry. Her appeals are ignored. <br /> <br />Taking matter into her own hands Godiva relinquishes her wealth. Her jewels are contributed to pay for all the taxes of Coventry's villagers. This is pure insolence in King Canute's eyes. To alleviate Canute's anger and postpone taxation Godiva now faces dishonor and shame if his challenge of riding naked on her horse through Coventry is accepted. <br /> <br />Godiva is David Rose's debut novel. The tale of Godiva, a unique woman of her time, as Rose tells it, has been handed down from generation to generation in his family lineage. Rose is an Academy Award-winner for film special effects, and it clearly shows through description. Dialog on the other hand is at times klutzy and characters in need of more development. Still none of this takes away from this legendary tale. <br /> <br />Godiva is an entertaining book that highlights a number of topics: religious beliefs, courage, love, and survival. It is no doubt David Rose's debut novel is a promising start as an author, and I certainly hope to read more of this upcoming series! Thank you Mr. Rose. Definitely recommended! <br /> <br />Reviewed by Betsie <br />	2004-11-23

Anyone who does that should be hounded out of office for all time.\\" <br /> <br />But how far is America willing to go? How much are we, the people, willing to tolerate? <br /> <br />The war in Iraq, government deception and corporate misdeeds on an unsuspecting public are just some of what readers can expect. Absolute Friends is filled with engaging characters that guarantee to generate reader sympathy. The underlying layers and messages are sure to evoke much thought no matter how one feels of the ongoing war, 9/11, political views or President Bush. <br /> <br />Absolute Friends is an exceptionally powerful and spellbinding novel. Not only in its implications of democracy but also in how the threat of terrorism is being used, in our world of today. If you liked Fahrenheit 9/11, you'll like this book. This is one book you'll want to read or give as a gift to your favorite activist! <br /> <br />Reviewed by Betsie <br />	2004-11-17

However, her risk taking methods make others within the firm somewhat nervous. Though since completing her work with Dr. Polk, a neurosurgeon, who was in need of capital expansion, Tucker feels confident she'll get it. <br /> <br />That is until the Doctor turns up missing, money can't be accounted for and the firm is being sued for 11 million dollars! <br /> <br />To make matters worse - her original files, which prove the claim is incorrect, are missing, and her Aunt Sylvia who has conveniently moved in with her dog suddenly claims the Malibu beach cottage that Tucker's grandmother left to Tucker in her will, is hers! What Aunt Sylvia doesn't reveal is that the land the cottage sits on is worth about 2 million. <br /> <br />Faced by a wall of secrecy, Tucker has too many unanswered questions, leaving her with no choice but to investigate the crime or face criminal charges of fraud and embezzlement. She has one week in which to clear her name, identifying Polk's accomplice and the person who helped alter her business plan, while Mo Whitner threatens to turn her into the FBI, which could probably turn up an insurance scam as well. <br /> <br />Tucker isn't going to waste a second, and finds herself investigating the crime-desperately hunting for clues. Her amateur sleuth skills lead to a number of high-level individuals, as well as her ex-husband, Eric, her own staff, the doctor's insane receptionist, and confrontation with autopsy photos. <br /> <br />False Profits is not only the author's debut novel, but is well written, fast paced and fresh. The result is a book you have difficulty leaving once you begin its reading. Sinclair Tucker, the fiery heroine would make Jessica Fletcher proud! Patricia Smiley is a talented author, and certainly one to keep an eye on - in a sequel perhaps? <br /> <br />Reviewed by Betsie <br />	2004-11-15

She constantly gives off the aura that she has had a physical relationship with Hamilton in the past and that some of it still hangs around even though nothing has ever come of their \\"friendly\\" relationship.<br /><br />Hamilton receives a call from Detective Felton Isaac Bradshaw summoning him to 225 Dexter Avenue. Both men have known each other since grade school. Upon arriving at the requested location, Hamilton finds Bradshaw standing next to a barely discernible corpse.<br /><br />The oddity of this encounter is that Bradshaw allows Hamilton to move the body around, as well as handle evidence without the crime scene techs present. This doesn't register with Hamilton until it is too late. He's struck from behind.<br /><br />When Hamilton comes to, he discovers Bradshaw is dead!<br /><br />The same day: Penny is summoned away by her mother- supposedly her forgotten stepbrother is back in town.

Brendan James was a successful travel writer and once best-selling author who now feels he's suffering from a severe case of writer's block. He's arrogant, obnoxious, self-centered, has been blessed with good looks, his conquests many and easily discarded with no remorse. Having asked for a ridiculous advance, he's about to blow a book deal with no manuscript to show for, thus ruining his career. Reed Press' editor, Jake Hogan, is on the verge of committing suicide himself due to his \\"prima Dona.\\" As a last ditch effort, Jake suggests Brendan attend a number of events, to help spark the flow of creative juices, which are to take place on the Man of Isle, including a mermaid festival. <br /> <br />Frustrated with the scenery and local stock Brendan attempts to catch a ferry to Dublin, but soon learns of its sinking and with no immediate way out, is forced to take shelter in Heather Bay, a small village left behind by modern technology. Trying to obtain a room for the night Brendan impersonates a reporter for a prestigious magazine. What he gets is a musty houseboat that seems a remnant from the 60's. <br /> <br />The comical mishaps, and deranged characters of Heather Bay prompt Brendan to stay a bit longer than anticipated. He attends a \\"Live Underwater Mermaid Show,\\" later meeting the exquisite creature, Christine Hamilton back in her dressing room only to be insulted. Taken by the beauty, Brendan looks for other ways to cross her path, while searching for descent material for his book.  <br /> <br />Brendan quickly discovers that these villagers are not only obsessed with their annual festivities, Merfolk, a legend, and \\"the curse\\" - that turns out to be a reality and love! But it's the antiquated villagers themselves that propel Brendan to write, and write, and write! His only fear is that they discover his true identity and the purpose for his inquisitive interviews. <br /> <br />I found myself rooting for the village volunteer \\"virgin\\" - Michael, the Siren's Whale pub owner as he hangs from a mast anxiously waiting a mobbing by an \\"estrogen fueled, biological ticking bomb,\\" of lonely women searching for love. Michael thanks God, grins, and shuts his eyes. Like Julian Wesley, Brendan's psychotic neighbor and Brendan himself, I burst with laughter when the plan went awry. <br /> <br />Kelly Reno has created some memorable characters in Heather Bay. Misadventures & Merfolk is a comedic fantasy with a romantic twist, and being at the lowest point in your life. If you're looking for a good laugh then pick a copy, you won't regret it! <br /> <br />Reviewed by Betsie	2004-08-14

Carefully selecting his victims. The game, like baseball: 9 innings, and 9 victims. His rules for Wycheck: tell no one and quit your job.

Dawson following chain of command gives charge of the investigation to high-profile FBI investigator John Hightower.<br /><br />Hightower is an intelligent man who has solved many a case, and a \\"worthy\\" opponent for an \\"invisible\\" killer. But like all serial killers, Simon makes a move that will open his own eyes.<br /><br />The questions that will haunt readers are: With an impressive lineup, which of the players will emerge as Master of the Game? Can Hightower's mental approach prepare him for when he steps up to the plate? Can he swing, realistically? And what will rewards; will Wycheck's book bring him?<br /><br />Author William Tepper should be commended on well-developed novel with characters, as intriguing as the plot. Master of the Game has all elements ofa blockbuster thriller so perfectly entwined that one can't wait to turn the pages and before realization it dawns on one, the book is finished!<br /><br />Reviewed by Betsie	2004-07-26

April 29, 2004<br />This spiritually cased novel depicts the trials and tribulations of a man called, Cearl. Cearl is a Christian of Mone faith, which was born with a rare skin condition known as the white mark. To truly understand the basis of belief surrounding those with the white mark we must go back to the birth of the Kathe religion.<br />Three books discovered long ago in a cave, the book of the testament, the ancient word, and the lost (third) book. It is the third, and definitely the lost book that causes division within the Christian faith. Those who discovered these biblical treasures have very different interpretations as to its scriptures on the second coming of Christ and salvation.<br />The Kathe religious cult was formed from those who believed that atonement was necessary for salvation moreover; this could only be attained through their Piaculum (white-marked Gods). These fierce technically advanced warriors sought out their Piaculum and pursued their religious beliefs relentlessly.<br />The gentile benevolent Mone, whose faith based origin believed Christ suffered for the sins of man. Therefore, all who seek Christ with their hearts shall attain salvation, at the mercy of the Kathe's. <br />Cearl born and raised in the Mone faith is troubled by memories of his childhood adoption by the Kathe's, as well as a ferocious desire to protect his family. The story follows Cearl from boyhood to manhood. As an adult Cearl struggles through life attempting to maintain his faith, while serving God's purpose.<br />This is the most moving, inspirational tale of faith I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Not only does it inspire those struggling with life's woes, but it also teaches how to maintain a closer walk with Christ through faith and love.<br />The Piaculum is well written and the flow is nice, keeping readers entertained.

Stewart's novel gives courage for others to be resilient. Although it is obvious she survived because of her own strength.<br />Still, it is almost impossible to believe, that in this modern age many children suffer hours, days, weeks, and even months of pain caused by abuse from parents or other authority figures.<br />Stewart's novel also shows how children that suffer abuse are scarred both physically and mentally, suffering severe long and short-term effects of their abuse. <br />Every year an estimated one million children suffer from some form of child abuse.

We find in Swartz's poetry a strong passion, combined with a bold and active imagination.<br />Overall, Swartz's collection of poems, are a little darker, and much more raw than my usual - I liked them! I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys poetry, especially to those who still have pent up anger, it may prove to be very therapeutic and realize they aren't alone.<br />Reviewed by Betsie	2004-03-27

Now picture that someone is mistreating you, and you are completely unable to retaliate in any way. Then try to imagine what would be running through your mind? Terror, anxiety, and a hate that you can do nothing with: except hold it all inside.<br /> <br />Stewart reveals such a child in her novel Nightmares Echo.<br /> <br />With an emotional and pressing drive, the author unveils a family disintegrated and why people fall into the pits of hell, reaching out, but never quite able to grasp the rope, falling even further into darkness.<br /> <br />In this well written novel, this child learns to cope with the &quot;Monkey On Your Back,&quot; into adulthood. Stewarts novel gives courage for others to be resilient. Although it is obvious she survived because of her own strength.<br /> <br />Still, it is almost impossible to believe, that in this modern age many children suffer hours, days, weeks, and even months of pain caused by abuse from parents or other authority figures.<br /> <br />Stewart's novel also shows how children that suffer abuse are scarred both physically and mentally, suffering severe long and short-term effects of their abuse.<br /> <br />Every year an estimated one million children suffer from some form of child abuse. If you are a past victim of abuse or not, I highly recommend Nightmares Echo, as it can be valuable in helping you recognize the negative feelings and emotional traps that can occur. This novel is certainly one of the best I've read, giving healing, validation and inspiration for all.<br />Reviewed by Betsie	2004-03-06

In a twisted form familiar storybook characters are depicted in modern daylight - such as prostitutes, serial killers, thugs, etc. Crime is widespread within Breco.<br />Fractured is witty, and well written. Mayers has done an excellent job of combining these tales with contemporary life. <br />This is an intriguingly dark colored novel sprinkled with a dash of comedy, and an ending guaranteed to astonish!

I chose to review this magazine with the understanding that its target audience was teen girls. However, I discovered that not only does it thoroughly discuss issues, which concern teen girls, but also crosses cultural boundaries. Revolve provides data on world issues, community services, family problems, it teaches self-reflection and ultimately helps to center life around God.<br />This refreshing magazine accomplishes all of the above in brilliant format. Each book of the New Testament is divided into sections and questionnaires that when answered truthfully, reveal characteristics about one self and relationships. Uplifting suggestions for change are also provided.<br />Revolve has caused self-improvement in this reviewer. Reawakening my spirituality, to focus on doing something to help others, by donating time to clothe/feed the hungry and help the elderly. Moreover it has inspired me to reflect on my relationship with God, and how and what I must do to fulfill Gods purpose for me.<br />Like the Bible itself, the Books of the New Testament in Revolve are like Daily Bread for the Spirit. Revolve is a great teaching tool for not only teens girls, but women as well.<br />I plan to use Revolve as a consortium. Much like the blank pages provided in the magazine for reflection. Reviewing this magazine has left me with blank areas waiting to be filled spiritually. I look forward to the next magazine, and pray that I use Revolve, as wisely as it has been written.<br />Reviewed by Juanita Reynolds	2004-02-23

The ideas written in this book have already been written more than a thousand times. We've even heard this type of story from aspiring immigrants over, and over. Maybe from someone within your own family.<br />What makes &quot;La Nueva Raza Latina en America&quot; unique is that this is the true story of one man, a hopeful illegal who dared to enter the United States - all in search of the &quot;American&quot; dream, and found it.<br />Alcazar, and his wife, from Lima, Peru applied for and surprisingly enough got a visitation visa to the U.S. then boarded a plane, hours later landing in LA. He cozened with the Mexican population and passed himself off as one of them, just in case he was caught by immigration. Thus making it easier in returning to the U.S.<br />In detailed description, the author recounts how he reached his dream of running his own Bookkeeping business. Alcazar takes the reader step by step, through his struggles as well as his good fortunes.<br />But even the worst can happen to those who reach their goals. Like a drug addict, a crash down to reality can be a nasty blow!<br />Definitely the books objective is to save time in arriving at one's goals and managing to have a standard of life equal or better than a born &quot;American&quot; citizen. But by lack of faith they have been only used by few, is why in the United States the richest country of the world, only 5% is economically independent, for that reason also, so many are poor - specially between the Latinos.<br />It conscientiously touches on important, and necessary subjects for personal growth. Overcoming and happiness of the human being, among them: Desire, Work, Preparation, Persistence, Value, Faith, Spiritualism, Optimism and Success.<br />Written in Spanish only, clearly this book is aimed at Latinos, and with good intentions. Fact is, not only do Hispanics make up the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country; they also represent a commercial powerhouse.<br />Although I believe thisbook would be of great value to all people, from all walks of life. &quot;La Nueva Raza Latina en America&quot; is not only inspiring but an eye opener. An absolute sure winner and the author should consider resubmitting this book to a publisher in English of course, as many would benefit from what lies between the covers.

A time when the west was, still, just an infant. The author, Douglas Boren has filled the pages with many heroic experiences and interesting additional characters mixed in.<br />The reader is flung into battles between the Union, Mexican-American war and Indians and settlers. One-man finds his soul mate and another having lost his was left with the possibility of building another relationship in time. But you do not have to take my word for it, pick up a copy and see just how quickly you find yourself in the midst of a battle landscape, smelling the cannon smoke, firsthand.<BR> <BR>The camaraderie Boren builds with the characters is great because you feel the friendship and hardships between them as they take you along their journey. The author brilliantly brings the reader into the story with these relationships thru these characters and the actions that drive them forward. So much that you find yourself relating to experiences you have had with your own good friends, as well as rooting for the heroes.<br />Boren is very knowledgeable about the era and the surroundings of his story. I thought that the pace of the book with the lengthy and brutal descriptions might deter other readers in completing this well thought out tale.

Although, history buffs will find and delight in its accurate and interesting descriptive.<br />I would recommend this book for readers age 17 and up.

There are two schools that these middle aged children attend, Radcliffe the prestigious private school and Glendale public elementary. The author reveals the differences, fears, and challenges of these families through the eyes of the children. In spite of their diversities, the children develop close friendships, which cause them to share the family secrets with one another. The parents concern for their own children cause them to bond and seek solutions for these problems, for the sake of the children.<br />During several community and school activities, it is discovered that Debbie's mom is an alcoholic, Rita has sickle cell, Tammy is adopted, and Stacey, a Radcliffe student has aids. Also one of Radcliffe's top athlete's is dealing drugs! To add insult to injury, the school board has allowed the enrollment of an African-American student as well.<br />The camaraderie of Plains Estates awakened past memories for this reviewer. As a child growing up in a metropolitan city, we had block units. These block units were established and comprised by parents in the community who organized committees, supervised protection, and planned activities for the youth. We, as neighbors, knew each other well and watched out for one another. Presently I have lived in my house for over six years and only know the first names of those that live on either side of me. Whereas in the past one not only knew his neighbors first and last name, but also people were less fearful and more trusting of one another with higher moral values. <br />In comparison, today people are overly cautiously related to high crime, increase use of drugs and decrease of moral values.<br />The author brilliantly uses simplistic views and emotions of children to expose \\"our\\" prejudices, bigotries, and unfounded apprehensions based on lack of knowledge and understanding of cultural, racial, physical, and psychological differences.<br />I applaud you Ms. Milner, this novel; \\"Children of Plains Estates\\" could easily be viewed as the poster child for diversity training.
