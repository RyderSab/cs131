The Salk vaccine \\"safe?\\"  Salk a genius?<br /><br />  The blunt facts are that pressure from the March of Times resulted in the Salk vaccine being marketed despite its contamination with simian virus.  Moreover, as marketed by Cutter in the '50's it contained live virus and gave hundreds polio.<br /><br />  Sabin went on to develop the vaccine which gave me and millions of others protection--in Russia!

Had sufficient attention to Ann Jones description of incompetent avaricious administrators at a traditionally black college, the lethal mistakes at Los Angeles' King-Drew hospital could well have been avoided. But then, what can be said of those for whom all persons of color are indistinguishable so that a giant of a legal mind like Thurgood Marshall can be replaced without protest by a seminary dropout.	2004-12-09

Alas, the coverage is far from uniform and the notation is constantly changing.  No point in requesting clarification directly from Peacock.  In reply to, \\"some symbols are used before they are defined,\\" you'll be told that \\"the meanings of the symbols are well known to any physics undergraduate.\\"  Complain that one of those well-known symbols seems to have an entirely different meaning in some other section of the text, and you'll be told to look at such and such an equation for the new definition.  Mathematicians who have their own set of standard symbols, such as  ^ for the outer product will find themselves completely baffled.<br />  Text lacks all mention of loop quantum gravity.	2004-08-25

But the evangelist talked on and on and by the time the plate finally did come around, Twain stole a quarter from it.<br /><br />Hysterically funny to begin with, the desire to make this book all things to all people (and, one suspects, the publisher's demands that this book be some minimal length) soon reduces this tour de force to a colossal bore.<br /><br />Bring back the short novel!	2004-08-25

Both he and Peacock quickly ascribe alternate meanings to &Ugrave; (DC p13 and p 39).<br /><br />The text has much algebraic manipulation and the simplifying assumptions come thick and fast.  Sometimes so fast, that Masden forgets to include the explanation.<br /><br />On page 37, Masden states, \\"Then recalling from the solution to equation (3.22) that S(t)~t**2/3.\\"  No proof of this exists anywhere in the text.<br /><br />On pages 44 and 46 are phase diagrams (Figure 5.1, 5.2), but there is no explanation of what phase diagrams are or how they are to be interpreted.<br /><br />Some of the material seems unnecessary ... in the author's own view! Page 44, for example, contains a slew of algebraic manipulations only to conclude with the statement that the equation he just derived is of little practical use and one is advised to use the equation on the previous page.	2004-08-25

If you want more on jargon, consult [...] and read You Look Nice Today by Stanley Bing or A Shortage of Engineers by Robert Grossbach.<br /><br />  Each chapter of this splendid and well-researched read, with the exception of three, is headed by a description of a fad.  The three errors are dancing mania (public health problem not a fad), coueism (still in existance in the Church of Religious Science), and ouija board (used to communicate with the dead).  Why the errors?  carelessness or indifference on the writer's part?  a deliberate puzzle?  My own guess is that she simply forgot until some copy editor calling an hour before the deadline demanded three more fads.	2004-08-08

Similar but superior to the Alexandrian Quartet; we believe what we want to believe and if we are politically connected our beliefs can be highly dangerous to others.  Superior in that we gain insight into the customs and practices of the time along with an uneasy feeling that what Pears writes of science and politics is as true today as it was then.	2004-03-07

The actress who reads the books on cd version is superb.  Sometimes you'll howl with laughter and sometimes you'll just be thankful for your own family.<br />To make it hang together, the authors (as they admit in a preface) have taken events that occurred with many different employers and to with many different nannies and woven them into two protagonists.  The result is that from to time I would scream at the dashboard, &quot;Quit.  Walk out.&quot; or when the car keys were thrown at her, &quot;thrown them back, hard!&quot;  On the other hand this allows the authors to make their real point--if the nanny is a non-white immigrant with little education and has no immediate relatives for emotional and financial support, then she can't quit, and must put up with everything.<br />And, there is the hidden horror: wht wil the children of such indifferent, emotionally sterile parents be like as parents, themselves.<br />Thanks mom and dad, I only hope I was able to give my children a fraction of the love, you gave me.	2003-07-24
