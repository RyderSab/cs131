It's an easy-to-read book that gives you \\"goose-pimple bumps\\" from Brad's challenges and accomplishments. Anyone who reads this will be touched by his story.  Thank goodness so much more is known about Tourettes now, but 15-20 years ago it was obviously so misunderstood.  Brad's modesty and courage are inspiring. This books holds lessons for youth, teachers, parents and so many more.	2005-08-29

Like many of the other reviews, I eagerly picked this book up to learn about the man behind the wonderful characters AND his relationship with Gilda.  Yuck, too many details about his affairs and marriages in a most immature and self centered way.  It was all about what his significant others could do for him.  The writing was easy, but I'm glad I didn't pay for the book.	2005-06-16

Thank you Aaron Lansky! As I was reading it my emotions went from \\"goose bumps\\" to tears.  I was in social work graduate school at Yeshiva University in New York City at the same time that this project was getting started - I only wish I had known about it at the time so I could have been part of the vision.  This book brought my beloved grandmother (who died nearly 30 years ago) alive to me. I took Yiddish as an elective in college, but found few who shared my interest.  Although I was raised in an unaffiliated family, I became a professional in the Jewish community to give others a love of Yiddishkeit - that for me was nurtured through Yiddish music.  Living in the midwest for the past 24 years, I so miss the the same level of attraction to Eastern European Culture that I felt growing up in Philadelphia in the 60's and 70's.  Lansky's book brought alive the culture, the idiosyncrasies, the passion, the humor, the food, the intellect, the values, etc. I can't wait to recommend this book to all my friends who share an interest in this subject.	2005-04-25

I would definitely read something by this author again, but I finished the book disappointed.	2005-03-27

Growing up as a Jewish girl in the 1970's on the east coast, I thought this book was so creative and extremely well written. In fact, I couldn't put it down.  Yes, parts are silly, but it is so well written that I had a smile on my face the entire time.  I can't wait to read more by this author.

I couldn't put it down!  Yes, how easy it is to lose one's way in this society.  When Michelle talked about being selfish I wanted to scream that I think (as a parent and as a parent educator) she is one of the most unselfish people I have ever read about.  She gave of herself to her children in the most basic and giving of ways - especially as such a young woman herself. Her words are easy to digest and I feel like I know her.  I want to congratulate her for not only writing such an inspirational story, but being the type of loving parent we should all strive to be - especially those of us who have been fortunate enough to have all the luxuries of life.  I have always been grateful for what I have, but I hope Michelle's teachings will stay with me for a long time.	2005-03-17

First of all, this book is well written.  It is not necessarily \\"enjoyable\\", because some of it is emotionally painful to read (when discussing pain!), but it is truly compelling.  It is definitely a reality check and can even empower one to know what to ask and how to ask their doctor for options.  We should see our doctors as human and science as less than perfect.   <br /> <br />I am familiar with prayer that I interpret as not asking God to heal us, but rather to pray for doctors to have the strength of their wisdom.  That is what this book is all about - a lay person's perspective on the realities of doctors and medicine.	2005-03-17

I have read this book twice and have given it to at least 5 friends to read.  Why does this book touch me in such a personal way?  I am not quite sure (I'll just have to read it again!)<br />Perhaps it's her down to earth writing.  Perhaps it's the human-ness of the book - real people with real problems (or ordinary people with extraordinary situations?).  Perhaps it's the use of blessings to confirm life itself.  Perhaps it is a confirmation of Judaism (liberal or traditional) as a path to live a more fulfilling life even when life &quot;isn't fair.&quot;  Perhaps it is a realization, as we mature, that bad does happen (and, sometimes good does come out of bad).  Also, human pain is real and common - and, becomes easier to live with in a caring community.	2001-12-07
