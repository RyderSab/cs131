Brenda Joyce is one of the most consistently satisfying romance novelists, and this book is no exception: but \\"Lizzie\\", the heroine, goes way beyond kindness, self-sacrifice, and martyrdom - she debases herself to a level that achieves unreality, in a jarring contrast with what any well-bred woman of her time would've done.  Her willingness to relinquish her self-respect would make one wince (in 1812, OR in 2005).	2005-10-05

More positively, \\"The Crimson Petal\\" shows that even in an age of both figurative and literal constriction, women could escape their exploiters/oppressors.  Like the reviewer ..., I was somewhat frustrated by the abrupt ending of this novel, though its deliberate ambiguity may simply be reflective of the uncertainty of the times and the charcters' morality themselves.

Traditionally, I did not like Peter Straub's writing, because it was meandering.  To me, &quot;The Talisman&quot; combined the worst excesses of both writers - too silly, and too long - and I could barely get through it.  What a pleasure, then, to discover that its sequel was an engaging, tightly written story, that demonstrates the maturing in style of both authors.  Like Straub's recent &quot;Mr. X&quot;, and King's &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Black House&quot; has a much more focused narrative, and more believable characters.  For the person who leans more toward traditional supernatural horror, and away from novels that border on sci-fi/fantasy, I can't recommend this book more highly.	2001-12-06
