US	39757789	R2I2B1OB71FUIY	0345391373	210660787	An Incomplete Education, Revised Edition	Books	5	36	72	N	N	yes	I give it five stars, as the humor helps dislodge negative thinking, emotional and knee-jerk reactions surrounding so-called \\"intellectual\\" subjects.    Incomplete is a bit of a misnomer: within its context, its relatively all-encompassing, after its fashion.     If it doesnt spontaneously slipstream an entire education into your mind, it is at least a start.    (( Becoming dogmatic, even fanatical, can be a negative side effect of a real 'Incomplete' education. To be able to negotiate ideas, transcend them, etc. is more the essence. Becoming too analytical is also not the purpose of education (educare: a leading out, not a stuffing in.) Maintaining  a balance of understanding and measured humanitarianism, is. ))    Yet I'd rather someone directed such money to a copy of Benet's somewhat pricier and bigger 'Benet's reader's encyclopedia,' overall a better investment. The choice ? Its hard to say. Benet's is larger, tightly texted, and is capable of alienating those who may be more receptive to the 'Incomplete Ed'n.' Which is better to start with? The one that will not alienate from the general path of broadening one's education, is the thing to start with.    'Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia' comes much recommended. 'One read-thru can triple your general knowledge' says one Amazon reviewer. (Rather gives the lie to Benet's as a dilettante's mere reference book, or a pricey/classy crutch exclusively for English majors. See reviews.) Yet its definitions are brief. You will find yourself hunting for context with Benet's. Still useful, tho.    (If folklore is more your bent, your lit. ref. of choice may be Brewers' Dictionary, not Benet's.)    Taken all together, 'Incomplete' is also not as good as, say, the long out-of-print Harry Elmer Barnes, ' Cultural and Intellectual History of the Western World' ( 3 vol., 1300 plus pages !)or the additon of approaches I have added below. Yet, accompanied by Hirsh's ' Dictionary of Cultural Literacy' and such-like, it can constitutea good start. And better than trying to read a multi-volume encyclopedia all at once.     Take these two Ivy league liberals, and balance them with the 'right-wingers' of the 'Dictionary of Cultural Literacy.' and you will be at least assured of symbolic overall balance. They should approach a kind of introduction to what may be missing from your education.    Harry Elmer Barnes tells of how Aldous Huxley, in his essays, novels, and short stories, managed to encompass practically the entirety of world knowledge. I think anyone who has on their shelf Huxleys' 'Complete Essays' (6 volumes, sold seperate, Ivan R. Dee Publishers,) Philip Weiner's 'Dictionary of the History of Ideas' (four or five volumes,) and perhaps Harry Elmer Barnes' own 1,350-page , 3 vol effort, has a functional base for their own complete education. *** If someone knows better, won't they say it here? ***    Certainly no one should miss Aldous Huxley's small essay book, ' Brave New World Revisited,' even if all you have is a vague notion about the original fiction work.     Isaiah Berlin is generally considered one of the best authors you could read, in his many volumes, about the history of ideas.     WH Auden collection of essays, ' Forewards and Afterwords,' also ought not to be omitted from anyones autodidactic path. Many and various subjects discussed there.     Add, for only twenty dollars, Barzun's ' Dawn to Decadence.' It's worth it. I have already got more than the cover price out of this book. The abridgment of Toynbee's 'Study of History' is highly touted as 'the one book you must read, even if you never read another(I paraphrase)' by the Nation magazine. . .    Aldous Huxley, in a 1930s essay, said to read Montaigne's essays, balance it with Pascals' Pensees, and add David Hume, Spinozas' Ethics and Correspondence, and Henri Poincare's works on science philosphy, as excellent intellectual background.     More usefully than a dictionary, add a good thesaurus to read yourself to sleepon to improve the gradient pastel subtleties   of your vocab., and you're on your way with a basic educational (inc. Incomplete ed'n, Hirsh dictionary)  that's functionally hard to beat, for starters.     McGraw Hill's smaller 'Readers Handbook,' paper, touts itself as a must have for any shelf. Checking up on it, I agreed, and bought a copy. Until you graduate to the larger readers' handbooks ( Holman, etc.) it should stand you in good stead for awhile.    Many own several thesaurii. What a useful way to relatively quickly begin to organize words - and hence ideas - in one's eye and mind ! In fact, one useful way to begin to enrich one's education might be to carry a thesaurus around with one continually, and read it thru at various moments. Keeping eyes and ears receptive, an enriched vocab will begin to allow you to access ideas all over the place.     Any better ideas ? I'd love to know. Thats the main reason I write this review: someone speak up, and 'add to!'     Jaeger's pricey classic trilogy 'Padeia' on ancient Greek culture, might be useful to add for many folks( now out in paper, 3 vol.) in spite of its cover price. I know I have added it to my shelf !    The old standby/ introductory 'History of Western Knowledge ' by van Doren, at @ 500pp., may be useful to many.    'Passion of the Western Mind ' is a possibility, as newer than anything Durant has done since he died, and in high favor by the late Joseph Campbell. Let its latter-paged politically correct /new age 'rap' balance the perceived stodge of Barzun's effort.    Larger (800+ pp.) and now in paperback, is Peter Watson's 'From fire to freud: a history of ideas.' Seems to get good reviews here on Amazon, tho it may not substitute for , say, reading Isaiah Berlin.     From here, you might move on to Adler's Great Books Western World series and supplements (heed his fiction list,) enriching the lacunae with such as may be found in 'Dr. Eliot's five foot shelf' of Harvard Classics and Shelf of Fiction.Yet heed what Harvard has to say on the internet, about the idea that simply reading gobs of famous ancient classics, is not their idea of a complete education. Many famous classics are very time-specific, for example. Much of their virtue is revealed by understanding their contexts, geographical and historical(ie, 'place- and time-line virtues.')    Still it wouldn't destroy you to selectively graze such texts, being careful not to:  A. be overly blown away by such revelations as you may find there;  B. reject a text, like Plato, just because you disagree with a few of his more extreme statements;  C. neglect proper digestion of the classics by merely finding in them stuff that more or less reinforces only what you already know, and ignoring ideas that may be overall difficult to assimiliate immediately, yet be worth your reasonable long-term consideration.    Add Burtons, 'Anatomy of Melancholy,' Kant's 'Critique of pure Reason, ' Schrodingers' 'What is Life?,' Heidegger's 'Being and Time,' 'What is called Thinking?' Wittgensteins' 'Ph. Investigations,' 'Blue and Brown Notebooks,' Schwab's 'Gods and Heroes', Borges 'Dreamtigers' and such, poems of GMHopkins, Pound's 'Personae ' and 'Cantos,' TS Eliot's 'Four Quartets,' Dylan Thomas, WCWilliams 'Paterson,' and you start to profitably walk the realm of the Great Books schools. (cut 'n paste)     \\"Never at Rest,' a large bio of Newton, enthusiastically recommended by critics as a must-own for any educated person.    Jacques Barzun thought Wm James 'Principles of Psychology ' as a must read for 'anyone who would profess to call themselves educated'. At 1,000+ pp., it may have something to offer you.       Interspersing such readings with Philip Weiner, 'Dict. of History of Ideas,' old edition now online, may prove highly useful to many.    A purely liberal education isn't everything.  I dunno about yourself, but I have decided, after some research into the vague realm of relative reliability of oft-changing science texts, to add the huge 'McGraw Hills' Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms' to my shelf. I expect grazing through its two-thousand-plus pages, to gradually brighten my receptiveness to scientific references as I encounter them in various places.    At any rate, a real mind is no joke to acquire. Sacrifices must be made, obstacles removed. Want a real education? You're on your own. Don't kid yourself, nor 'dry-rot at ease til the Judgement Day,' yet 'gather ye your stones to build your Basilica!'    To this we add two final aphorisms of education: ' Something of everything, and everything of something,' and 'Drink deep, or taste not, the Pierian spring: a little knowledge is a dangerous thing !'	2005-09-05
US	39757789	R1OLJDY882263N	0875161995	900007491	Scientific Christian Mental Practice	Books	5	42	49	N	N	yes, do get this.	Please note, before we even start, that no book, tape, etc. like this should be used as a substitute for any needed attention by a reputable doctor/physician. That would be sheer fanaticism.    The general obscurity of many spiritual healing books may be, in the long run, for the best. Easy access to such material may lead many unwise/inexperienced  individuals to run to the opposite of hypochondria, have too much faith in their own unpracticed ability to heal their own or others illnesses, and only tragedy may result. Even Emma Hopkins understands this problem, as you will gather from reading her books.       first off, with regards to this book, you may immediately start gathering the benefits of it by going ahead and resorting to some form of relaxed, continuous prayer that works for you, and an attempt to acquire that spiritual awareness which can modify entirely an individual for the better. However, I am so sure that many will benefit so much from the approach in this book, that I heartily recommend acquiring it. See all the quotes at the end of this review.    I am in much concurrence with the sentiments of the rest of the reviewers. If you're like me, and are finally coming to Emma Curtis Hopkins, rest assured that you are finally coming to one of the best and essential classics in new thought, creative mysticism, or whatever you would like to call it.     Second, know that this Scientific Christian book is used in 'New Thought' classes, along with Ernest Holme's larger ' Science of Mind' volume.    Experienced as I previously was, for over twenty years, with similar writings (oh, about twenty titles or so) I was pleasantly surprised and excited by reading 'The Statement of Being' on the internet, when i first encountered Emma's work. Having done it a year ago, I remain quite pleased with the memory to this day.    I read the entire 'Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East' series by Baird T Spalding twenty years ago, and didnt get as much out of itas I am getting from this smaller work by Emma Hopkins now.     To recapitulate one reviewer's observation: it IS one of the best friends you will ever have! I keep it like I keep Trine's 'In Tune With the Infinite,' another worthy volume which contains a particularly good and lengthy chapter on health, which many will apppreciate.     Read Goldsmiths' 'Practicing the Presence', Shinn's 'Writings' collection, and Emma's ' Scientific Christian Mental Practice' together, and you will be doing as one person on the internet says she does, re-reading these books together constantly. Interesting idea, and not a bad combination, apparently.     I occasionally return to Mary Baker Eddy's ' Science and Health' book, also.    (Emma has an excellent booklet from 1893, 'The Resurrection, ' which puts much of her essential ideas in a nutshell. A near perfect companion to her ideas as I have found. In fifteen short pages, worth re-reading over and over, it's the best thing of its kind and length I have found on spiritual healing, whether of body, mind , or life.     Yogananda has some small books on spiritual healing, yet they are not as good as Emma's 'Resurrection ' booklet, IMHO. If someone knows of one better, by anyone, I would love to know about it. I haven't found better, or as brief, than Emma's 'Resurrection,'  as of yet.)     3. Have patience with this book. Go back to it again and again. Get a right perspective on its contents. Emma's method is long-term and full-service, largely self-contained. You simply have to go over and over the lessons, 'til understanding shines.'    It is an advantage, not a drawback, that this concise, rich book poses a few obstacles to its reader. You're more likely to master its richer contents more thoroughly/carefully/usefully, than that of a lesser, flashier work of equal size.    The New Thought person can read Hopkins in the faith that they are reading one of the main teachers of almost the entire New Thought movement, such as it began.     Those who, out of prejudice or formality, have avoided Christian spiritual healing books,  and are finally coming around to them, can take consolation and encouragement in Hopkins' fairly educated background ( details of which may be found on the internet.) Hopkins' literary, historical, and religious references( Proclus, Parmenides, Lao Tzu, Plato, Carlyle, Bronte sisters, etc, etc, etc -- no end to it! ) taken from throughout history and from around the world, should reinforce the realisation of the traditional roots of spiritual healing, and also their faith in her work, as they read. This is especially so, if one chooses to read her other work, 'High Mysticism.'    4. I came to Hopkins via reading of her on the internet. Searches will yield fruit. The entirety of the first ohapter of SCMP, entitled ' The Statement of Being, ' can be found and read by searching on Gooogle or some other search engine.  One website even has an extensive collection of extracts contained in a nice series of .pdf downloads. Read those, read her quotes scattered about the internet, and you will be sure to want this book.     5. Dr. Israel Regardie once wrote a book back in the 'forties called 'The Romance of Metaphysics,' later divided and retitled into two seperate books ' Teachers of Fulfillment( 1980s, Falcon Press.)' and a smaller, 'Energy, Prayer, and Relaxation.' (Both now o/p.) I am surprised Regardie didnt endorse Hopkin's book more highly: I would have purchased a copy sooner. ( He did recommend Trine's aforementioned 'Infinite' book, and said he would not be rid of it. I second that idea, and have reacquired the Trine volume.)     Regardie's main theme was the origin of all this New Thought material from the one Eddy volume, ' Science and Health,' which one ought to own for a complete understanding of New Thought, spiritual healing, etc. (I am not exclusive: I like to blend and compare ideas, utilizing the best. Eddy fans may disapprove of Hopkins. I choose to be more discriminating in my eclecticism.) Certainly useful for comparison: Eddy and Hopkins are the two main seedings of the new thought movement, after Phineas Quimby, Emerson, Troward, Holmes, etc.     Access also an essay, 'The Art of True Healing,' by Regardie, which should also be read by anyone interested in these matters, for reasons of completeness.     6. Hopkins is more accessible than Eddy, overall, as far I am concerned. Certainly Hopkins seems less prone to Eddy's difficulties with apparent 'enemies' of her movement ( read about new thought history.) Yet I still keep Edy's 'Sci and Health' textbook.  At the very least, certainly they are worth comparing side by side.     7. The let-downs and diffuse doldrums one may experience with, say, Shakti Gawain, one will not experience with Hopkin's book. Hopkins is more careful and thorough, if more cryptic and difficult, clearly laying out for the readers comprehension the diffiulties inherent in spiritual healing, and a lot more of what it is really all about. In short, 'Scientific Christian' is the most complete book on the subject I have ever come across, new or old, and supplementation with her 'High Mysticism' is invaluable, for those with a taste for it. Still, I keep my copy of Gawain's 'Creative Visualization' book, and even admire even more her ' Living in the Light,' a copy of which I have proferred to a troubled friend.     Emma can even be funny. Her quote about the 'snails and asteroids studies' that people devote their lives too, shld. be posted everywhere.    8. Ernest Holmes and Chas. Fillmore were both students of Hopkins way back in those early days. I have gained some insight from Ernest Holme's ' Science of Mind,' which also sits on my shelf. Fillmore's ' Prosperity' volume (readable online) is worthy for comparison and enlightenment, to both Hopkins and Holmes.     Florence Scovel Shinn can be helpful along the way: tho' she, as others, apparently derived somewhat from Hopkins, her fiery 20's 'flapper' style of Christian metaphysics may be a relief and release for some, and her pithy insights garnered about faith, mind, and protection may offer something useful to the reader( 'wilder' elements of Shinn's doctrine not withstanding.)  In short, Shinn may usefully supplement Hopkins for many. Also for comparison purposes, useful.  I do like many of Shinn's affirmations.  (' Divine Love fills my consciousness with health, and every cell in my body is filled with Light.') Yet, Shinn is more of a 'weekend read,' by comparison. Shinn only manages to agree here and there with the rich horizons Hopkins offers to the reader in much more complete form.     Louise L. Hay: I recommend her 'Heal Your Body' book. Worth checking out. I can imagine many will find this book useful. You can now find it in two editions, one aesthetically expanded with relaxing/inspiring graphics for those who like such things.    For those like myself who have thought Shinn's four books incomplete( you can get all four in one volume,) supplementing her with Hopkins' two books, should be very enlightening! a quantum leap. Familiarity with both of these writers' books makes it obvious to me that Shinn, if she did not know Hopkins personally, at least was well-versed in her books.    It is strange that none of the New Thought writers I have read so far, on 'net or elsewhere, have ever mentioned the brief Christian healing section in Robert Burton's 17th century classic, 'Anatomy of Melancholy.' I bet many would find it useful to acquire this otherwise difficult book for the sake of this section.     Of course, Joel Goldsmith, a former student of Hopkins, may be a help: many swear by him. 'Practicing the Presence' and 'The Infinite Way' seem to be the preferred volumes among the cognoscenti; yet much to be recommended is 'The Art of Meditation(cf. Regardie.)'     Yet it would seem that anyone interested in visualisation, manifestation, new thought, etc., ought to own Hopkin's book. There is much init that is refreshing, easily grasped, and useful. The parts of it that may take a bit longer to understand ought not to alienate anyone from its study.     Besides the matter of her archaic, turn-of-the-century American prose style, Hopkins was better educated than most New Thought people in the first place, before she ever came to spiritual healing. Again, this ought not to be an obstacle: live with her work for awhile, til the light dawns. Her vocabulary and phraseology isn't as daunting as some have given others to believe, and hardly obscures her healing meaning, at least for most readers.     9. It is one of the tragedies of the new thought/new age movement, that so many of the religiously orientated volumes are so little recommended, when they can prove so useful, merely because an older style, termed 'archaic,' seems too likely to scare people off. What is the cure for this? So many could make such great use, if not initially daunted, bored, or frightened away by such.    With Hopkins, one at least has the sense of utilising something with a bit more history back of it, than some flourescently vaunted new age writer, who has not yet stood the test of time, and may be less deep, thoughtful, and enduring.    10. One can read and make use, without becoming dogmatic and repellant. Add Eric Hoffer's ' True Believer' to your shelf, for balanced perspective ! And the best work may be in silence.    Hopkins has other, if less known or popular, works ('Resume' of other book, 'High Mysticism,' 'Class Lessons 1888,' etc.) Hopefully these will soon be reprinted in book form. There is a Hopkins revival, as may be determined from research on the internet.    11. The entirety of the first chapter of ' Scientific Christian' may be read on the internet, assuming the Amazon sample pages don't convince. It may be searched for as 'Statement of Being.' Having read that, and any other Hopkins quotes scattered about the internet, I am sure you will want this book.    12. There exists a well-meaning anti-quackery trend, where such as Emma Hopkins come under attack, or at least suspicion. I think much of such criticism is shortsighted and/or misplaced. I hardly regard Emma Hopkins as a substitute for what currently manifests as the more wholesome benefits of orthodoxy, whether in medicine or religion. And neither does Emma Hopkins: you'll see it in her text.     Also, 'New Thought' Christianity distinguishes itself from the Christian Science school by regarding any spiritual metaphysics as an adjunct, not a substitue for, regular medical teatment by a qualified and reputable physician.     I would also mention, that there is more sound, useful, 'down-home' practical psychology in Emma Curtis hopkins than in many acclaimed psychology books I have read.    Of course, if any one reading here knows of one useful to accompany Emma's effort, or as good, won't they oblige us by a review, and recommending them here on this Amazon review page ?    I suppose Emma has made her way into a kind of tasteful and classic obscurity, where she has been ignored in favor of some more popular, modern, well-advertised souls. 'Old standbys,' especially those no longer living, perhaps often do.     A moot point perhaps: yet one worth considering. The revelations in the first chapter of Emma's 'High Mysticism' book offer much food for thought in few words, about the necessity for turning the 'inner mystic eye upwards' away from the things of the senses, a practice which Hopkins believes fosters sanity. This seems sound, if mystic, psychology to me, and some such idea ought to be adopted by our modern therapeutic psychologists. It might help create in their clients the healthy balance and wholesome sense of distance (from their worldly affairs, fears, emotions and such) that many of their clients may be looking for.    In truth, I understand completely the reviewer who stated his twenty-five-year devotion to this book. If you are going to get just one healing book, getthis one. I can see how, in the long haul, one can get so much from its 250-plus pages. It is worth reviewing over and over til all the ideas coordinate themselves and become useful.    One problem may be the archaic quality of much of Emma's prose. SCMP has little of this, tho' the ideas can be difficult enough, and require many 'goings-over.' Beleive me, you won't mind. This book is fresh air for seekers. 'A million times around the statements, and how shining and bright your life becomes!' as Emma says. ' There surely comes a moment when the full power of the words comes surging through us.'  Go over the material again and again at daily intervals, and gradually the problems will work themselves out.    ***some quotes, from SCMP and other Emma works:    ' Faith can fulfill your slightest wish.'    ' If God is your world, what have you to fear ? '    ' Look often to the Vast, Vast Countenance.'    ' You are the spiritual light that cannot fail.'    ' Great believers in miracles draw them. '      ' Touch not the earth - touch God !'    ' We must woo and woo the Majesty and Responsive Beneficence  ever facing us. Our wooing will be astonishingly rewarded.'    'If you can redden your face with a thought, you can straighten your crooked bones with a thought.'    ' ...by some power whereby the trees leave forth.'    '  There is always a way out of the greatest or least seeming evil.'    '  There is no combination of experiences so hard, so black, so complicated but that God can work a miracle in them. '    ' Take your highest thought of God.'    ' Let us never flinch at what is happening around us. What is transpiring above us is our concern. And this wins all battles; for the kingdom across the bar is the Ruling Kingdom. '    ' By continually keeping His name you have everlasting rest in delightful companionship, unbroken family life, abundant blessings greater than you can ask or even think.'    ' Let me tell you the twelve effects of thinking of the Spirit: You will have life, health, strength, support, defense, thinking faculty, wise speech, ability to record well your ideas, joyous song, skill in carrying out your principles, beauty of judgment, and great love.'    ' A woman who had no faith but had been told what wonder might be wrought through faith sat down and deliberately determined to learn it. She sat down in the midst of her poverty and loneliness with her little children about her and practiced learning. She seemed shiftless to her neighbors, but it was astonishing what \\"luck\\" that woman always had. Something good was always \\"turning up.\\" Her children were all talented, beautiful, prosperous. '    ' Men may gather all the gold into a lump, and say you cannot have any, but by some way of Spirit you  will come out with more abundant riches than all the rest put together. They may hold arguments and try psychological processes to chain your mind or change it, but the Spirit will make a way with you to keep you free from all such attempts. You will elude every mental opposition as easily as you elude material things. Jesus came through their belief that he was dead.'    ' a man kept praising God that he was so well, while a great tumor or some other kind of swelling was plain to be seen by his neighbors.  But he praised God publicly that he was so well for a whole fortnight. Long before the fortnight was up he was well, so that even his neighbors could see it so. '    ' To say that 'My Good is supply, God is my Good, therefore God is my supply' is to stir the mountains and the seas to bring us our new provisions.'    ' Looking, mentally, upon Jesus Christ as present, will cure poverty; it will cure blindness ; it will cure deafness; it will cure palsy; it will cure rheumatism; it will cure insanity. '    ' He, never having gone away from our side, we can look upon Him now, and be cured of whatever ailment we are crying about.'    ' Many will tell of how wonderfully they have been led by repeating the name of Jesus Christ. There was never any other character in history who gave orders to keep repeating his name. '    'There is one indestructuble substance pervading all things, from the remotest star to the nearest dust particle.  This substance is finer than any substance cognized by the senses. It is finer than the attraction of gravitation, cohesion, destruction. It can only be cognized by the mind.  It can only be handled by the thoughts of the mind. And only the understanding of the mind can make it useful. He who by any manner of thinking handles this substance soon finds himself experiencing vital renewals throughout  body and mind. He has begun the 'animation of the particular from the universal,' an art eagerly sought by the ancients. '    ' \\"I would know none among you save Jesus Christ, \\" said Paul to the Corinthians. '    ' Who now is ignoring every disastrous state of affairs, and separating himself to the One Name by which the first Apostles wrought their miracles? - Jesus Christ is that Name.'    ' ... receiving the Holy Spirit that alone makes whole. '    ' \\"The Spirit of a man is the candle  of the Lord(Ps 20:27.)\\" And by recognizing this candle sound health is established in the outer experience.'     ' When we know God, we have touched the very substance which can inform us how to work each minute wisely, so as to be clothed and fed and housed and healed, without any other process than simply knowing God. '    '  It is ideas of God which if you shepherd well, will get you into that state of mind called heaven, when you have health, judgment, prosperity. '    ' When we are spiritual, we do not try to bring great things to pass, yet they come to pass. '    '  The most wonderful achievements of mankind have been brought to pass by confidence in some wonder-working unseen power. '    '  As God is free now, so we are free now.'    ' Isnt it a joy to you to know that you within yourself the power to annul every evil thing?'    ' The ginger and glow of unvisioning life,cease for such as know that their true provisions and their true positions come from above, and nothing and nobody can take them from them. The Countenance that shines hot with healing tenderness and with rich giving is of more value than all that can possibly come by the clash of endeavor.'    '  Let us say, \\"Poverty is unreality; there is no such thing  as poverty; poverty is nothing to Spirit. Spirit owns all things.\\"'       '   Nobody need strive or haste for his prosperity if his faith is fixed, and his words keep repeating his covenant.'    '   In the Lord's house is much treasure.'        '  There is a self-supporting power in the Holy Spirit which, when you let it operate unhindered through you, leads straight to your substantial support.'    '  \\"As I look into the God who is support beyond my idea of  sustaining and supporting, I bring forth the plenty I see as I  look.\\" '    '   There are ways of thinking about your environment which will make you like a harp in the fingers of love, so enchanting will be your silent mind to the world hurt traveller, so blessed will sound your voice to the bruised child of human hardships.  You need not worry about whether you shall speak or not. You will have your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel if you take the fresh morning for giving thanks and glad praises unto the spirit and speak forth with freedom some lesson of this Science. '    ' We cannot fail while we are daily speaking the lofty principles of that Kingdom on the Earth, though not of it, which will come up before our vision more and more. '    ' Always high vision stirs right speech, silent or audible, and right speech silent or audible stirs right convictions, and the accomplishment of the seemingly impossible is the outcome.'    ' Error can come in bright packages of beautiful words, but it is better to have a mind of your own.'    ' We must give our strict attention to something supernally worth while.'    ' The ancient Bible taught that it is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and very flighty, rushing whither it listeth, but once tamed it will bring you great happiness.'    ' Let us say to unhappiness, \\"There is no unhappiness in Spirit; All is joyous peace.\\" And let us say within our own minds, \\"Now !now !\\" '    ' We take the conscious teachings and train ourselves till our machine-like bodies spring to as quick intelligence as our consciousness itself.'    ' Health sits in as a first sign of spirituality.'    ' Take some wine of doctrine, stronger and warmer ideas of life.'    ' The only thing worth working for is a right state of mind.'    ' say positively, \\"I do not believe it takes hard work to succeed in Gods universe.\\"'    ' There is no part of the body that may not open and indraw the subtler-than-air stimulants that would soon burst forth as strength.'    ' The soft flakes of healing are falling all around you all the time, even on your shadow.'    ' \\"God works through me to will and do that which ought to be done by me.\\" Be sure this is true. It is a great rest to think how many unnecessary things we have been doing that we are now relieved from doing. '    '  Be not tenacious of your own will. Be not exacting. Let Go. All is well around you: say: Rest in the Lord and He shall bring it to pass.'    '  \\"I am strong in the Lord and the power of His might. \\"'    '  You are so ready with your abilities that you soon become known as a leader among your associates if you learned early this: --\\"Jesus Christ is all in all.\\" --'    ' Give thanks, and praise the Spirit of God for the law of the self-increasing potency of every substance.'    ' Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee.'

' There is a faculty of your health whereby it loves to drop thru your mind and distill like the dew through your flesh.'    ' There is no warfare where the vision of God is. There is no disease where the healing Name is called. There is no inadequacy or failure while the Spirit of God is in the nostrils, inbreathed as the only breath. This is living truth.'

' The age of extreme religious sanctity and much checking of freedom is always followed by the license of immodesty and indulgence.     Thus, the bondage of all beliefs becomes apparent:    It is not Omniscience to believe anything. It is Omniscience to believe all things,which is to believe nothing.     It is not Omnipotence to be powerful and dominant others. It is Omnipotence to be the only Power, which is Love.    It is not Omnipresence to give instruction to mankind as to what to do and what not to do.

US	39757789	R2YSQ1K26X1G3D	0875426638	976333081	The Golden Dawn: The Original Account of the Teachings, Rites & Ceremonies of the Hermetic Order (Llewellyn's Golden Dawn Series)	Books	5	15	21	N	N	To "Outright confusing" of Chicago, Ill. :	(revised, corrected: 6/16/'04)    1. The Golden Dawn material has parts that are more or less easy to grasp, although a full, rich, deep meaning can take quite some time to thoroughly evolve into useful significance for the student.    I would add, however, that some of the 'body awareness' and 'visualising the body as full of holes,' which regardie features in some of his books and CDs/ tapes, may be bad, and even dangerous for some people, if only in the long run. Still, Regardie has much of value to contribute. (see my review for the largely useful 'One Year Manual.')    2. The Golden Dawn volume is particularly useful for the insights about life, mind, magic, and everything else one can think of, from Regardie's own words. Reading his work is not necessarily a mistake. Given its quality and pertinence, and since we have so little of it -- he wrote, but not massively/ prolifically -- many may as well attend to whatever they can get a hold of by Regardie.    3. If the \\"Outright confused\\" reader wants a perspective on what difficult reading can be all about, s/he could try reading Kant's first 'Critique,' Heidegger's 'Being and Time,' and Hegel's 'Phenomenology of Mind.' . It is said that much of these writers can take twenty years to get any where near to an appreciation for them, let alone a full, rich, thorough-going understanding. Yet people still read, study, and get something out of them. Even Kierkegaard presents reading problems for many, yet he claims many adherents.    It has been said, that rising difficulty in studying is no surprise: it is the age of learning disability pnemonena that have been presumed to gather under the label, 'Attention Deficit Disorder.' Such difficulties I believe, by some unfortunate principle of reverse or convoluted psychology, have even come to be worshipped under such labels, as though in a kind of chapel.    4. Part of the educational value of worthy yet difficult reading, is what it can impart, perhaps namelessly and unquantifiably, to the student, as a result of the sheer effort of study.    5. Another disillusionment a student may go through, is the stigma associated with meddling with things like the Golden Dawn. Recall the 'four powers of the Sphinx:' 'to Know, to Will, to Dare, and to Keep Silence.' Drawing alot of attention to your involvement with the Golden Dawn material, is sure to draw some kind of disrespect on your head, although such prejudice may be less proximous for many in these presumably (presumptuously?) more 'enlightened' days.     Sharing your enthusiasm with others on the occult, the Golden Dawn, or anything else that can be interpreted as 'colorful, glitzy, superstitious nonsense' to the uninitiated, is as unhealthy as revealing any other interest one may have in the wrong company, say, in cheap detective novels, which in some circles, is also likely to bring condemnation.    6. It should be pointed out, that you don't have to study the Golden Dawn all at once. It isn't like some dull or difficult novel you try to cram the night before an exam, or something like that. It is MEANT to be assimilated slowly, til you see what value it has. Regardie's writings, and those of WE Butler and Gareth Knight, may provide some useful insights into the desirability of studying this material.    In fact, there may be some real 'training effect' value hidden within the process of self-paced learning, so often overlooked when studying material like this. Study something too fast, and you mess up. Study something too slow, and there may be a similar problem. Somewhere in the middle, is the most productive pace for you, personally. And so it goes.     7. As to purpose, we might well ask Regardie himself:     \\" ...to provide some more or less intelligible approach to the subject so that, given an initial glimpse of the bright light flooding the world of magic, more people may be disposed to devote just a little of their energies and time to its study. The advantages and benefitsare such as to make this effort extremely worthwhile...     ...Magic is a series of psychological techniques so devised as to enable us to probe more deeply into ourselves.To what end? First, that we shall understand ourselves more completely. Apart from the fact that such self-knowledge in itself is desirable, an understanding of the inner nature releases us from unconscious compulsions and motivations and confers a mastery over life.\\" -'Foundations of Practical Magic,' 1979.    Similar material from Regardie can be quoted, from his various writings. Extensions of these ideas are possible. However, you can search quite some time, high and low in the popular literature, overall, for such enlightenemnt and insight about and towards life. Regardie's writing provides perspective and guidance of all kinds, and is useful, practical and enriching.    There are other recommended readings throughout Regardie's writings. If the Golden Dawn and Regardie appear to make themselves 'their own university,' as is said of Shakespeare, it at least is not an unworthy university. And the time and money one spends aquiring and studying this material might be more well-spent than say, the cash, energy annd time one may unproductively squander on several nights in a bar. It's all a matter of priorities, isn't it ?     In short, real self understanding just might be some job! Whether you choose Regardie's route, or some other, just make sure you don't cheat yourself, and end up with a mish mash of misunderstanding. Be objective. Determine your parameters. Don't listen to the nay-sayers, but dont spend all your energy in their negative, and even violent proximity, either.	2004-06-13

US	39757789	R2IM66ZAZR3QPN	0062720732	851944626	The New Lifetime Reading Plan: The Classical Guide to World Literature, Revised and Expanded	Books	5	48	76	N	N	good start ...	Of course you should read this book. And add a perusal of others like it. Call it a classics revival, or whatever, you will hardly be displeased by the benefits of reading the classics. You are sure to appreciate some guidance therein, if only to compare current perspectives.    I will say at the outset, that if there is one book worth reading, it is probably Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World Revisited.' It is a must for anyone. Read it before reading anything else.    Harvard president Chas. W Eliot thought the Bible and Shakespeare as entirely self-contained in their capacity to bring the unread masses far along the path to a liberal education. He designed the Harvard Classics, a blend of some east and mostly west,  five foot shelf of fifty books or so, to supplement or substitute for a formal expensive education for those 'even whose early education opportunities had been scanty.' Eliot later added the twenty volume 'Shelf of Fiction' to correct any perceivable defects in the original five foot shelf.    Mortimer Adler chose only western works for his Great Books set, attempting to provide the essence of a liberal education, and to enable the reader to come to partake in what he called 'the great conversation.'     Auden thought the Bible and Grimms fairy tales, much the foundation of western culture. TSEliot thought Dante and Shakespeare to 'ring the world round.' Borges thought everyone should read Dante. Jacques Barzun thought no education complete without at least a once-through reading of Wm. James' 'Principles of Psychology.' Aldous Huxley thought  Montaignes' Essays, Pascal's Pensees, Spinozas' Ethics and Correspondence, David Hume, and Henri Poincare essential reading. Dryden thought Chaucer to be 'God's Plenty.' Emerson seemed to think no other book actually existed outside of Plato's Republic. Stevenson thought the writings of Thomas Hardy to contain some of the best writing to be found anywhere at any time in any language. - So there's a starter shelf for you. We debate such advice. We would be silly to ignore it.      Barzun further delights/informs us with his revelation in ' Dawn to Decadence' how such as Marx's 'Capital,' Montesque's 'Spirit if the Laws' and Spenglers' 'Decline of the West,' all fall into a category of classics that 'every intellectual thinks he has read,' implying the difficulty of understanding such works outside of an intellectual and historical context, or without many re-readings.     However, I offer a nuggetted point of view, in a few steps:    1. The main thing is, with or without a guide, to start reading the classics. The benefits of starting will alter the tone of your mind, as it sees itself embarking and staying on a profitable track. A healthy tone of seriousness and enrichment increases.    Having once decided 'taking the upper hand in your own education' as the only wise and practical course to pursue. . .    The 'old saws,' or tidy aphorisms,  still apply here: generally, one book thoroughly read is  worth a hundred half-read; and ' Drink deep, or taste not, the Pierian spring; For a little knowledge is a dangerous thing !'    add also, that 'be admonished, of making many books there is no end,' much study is a weariness of the flesh,' and moderate/modulate yourself and your efforts accordingly. No point in getting educated, if you must become seriously ill, or even die, in the process! Dont make a wreck out of yourself. Addiction to such self-improvement and hard work is usually only admirable if you elude the sickbed and the graveyard.    Yet knowledge, per se, is fortunately not always what we seek from the classics. You can get knowledge in 'college,' such as it is (!) The Harvard university folks dont even count massive doses of the classics as a necessary series of steps to a full education, Dr Eliot or no Dr Eliot. We seek rather an overall cultivation of, and structure for, the mind as well as M. Adler's idea of a foundation for a liberal education.  We do not seek tooverload ourselves with impossibly archaic and indiegestible ideologies, and end up intolerant and intolerable ideologues ourselves. After thorough digestion of what we are able to absorb, we choose as little or as much as we will. We read, think, weigh, ponder, and  hopefully emerge without prejudice, with a broader mind.  We come to our own healthy conclusions. It's worth it.     2. Some few classics are of great enough difficulty to warrant a preferred emphasis on, over time, whatever else one may elect to read along the way. These are:       --Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, aka 'the First Critique' (you'll need his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics to help you with the Critique, - and it will still take you five years to understand it!)    --Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, (termed the greatest book ever written by some, can only be read at intervals and in small doses, rarely straight through.  The missing link in many an egghead education. Read it, and make note how many of your admired intellect popularizers havent read it, and have suffered thereby. And dont miss the section on 'miseries of scholars!')     --Pascal, Pensees( another rival for greatest book, may also take awhile to assimilate its posthumously gathered-together style)    --Spinoza, Ethics (not as difficult as Kant, perhaps, yet you might appreciate an early start with it. Correspondence is easier. Read it also.)     --Joyce, Ulysses     --Robert Musil, The Man Without Qualities( a tough code to crack, the humorous rewards rival Jane Austen)    --Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse (sorry, but the overall effect of this prose can make some heads spin: its re-readability ascribed to it by Woolf fans, no doubt hinges in part on necessity)      --Dante, Divine Comedy (Auden assures us, we'll be ninety before we know Dante)    --Husserl, Crisis of European Science ( termed one of the best abstract 'one-volume educations' in existence, yet strictly chewy Germanic elusive prose)     --Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript (K. offers difficulties, in spite of his religiosities, to even his most ardent adherents.)    --Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, and the Blue and Brown notebooks, as introductory. ( never mind that Wittgenstein 'leads nowhere:' neither do many mathematical formulae. Of the two vol's. mentioned, Phil. Inv'ns. shld at least have a place on your shelf, alongside your Bible, Shakespeare, Dante, Burton, Plato's Republic, Cervantes, etc.)       --Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit; and Heidegger 'Being and Time'  (you'll need a background in Kant, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, to accomodate this duo. Add Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Descartes, and Spinoza. Still, H. & H. can take up to twenty years to fully apppreciate, so it is said, however one prepares for them.)      --von Clausewitz, On War ( the difficult reading begins after the first chapter; posthumous unfinished portions and historical accounts must be co ordinated by the reader, and multiple returns to the text must be made to pull everything out of its bafflement and into proper perspective in the readers' mind )       Other titles may be added.  However, they would merely lengthen, rather than enrich, the list (special interests notwithstanding.)            Running the strength of the half-life of difficulty of these works in your mind for awhile, will make your calculus homework look somewhat simpler. Your previous problems reading the presumably formidable Dostoevsky, or something like the 'I Ching' and its alien imagery, or perhaps a difficult modern specialist classic such as Fenichels' 'Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis' will dissolve in difficulty to at least some gratifying extent, and make such reading, difficult though diverse, appear much easier and accessible.    From here, or along with these, you can fill in the tragic errors of your would-be tutors with the contents of such a set as Dr Eliots 'Harvard Classics,' readable on line, and/or Mortimer Adlers' 'Great Books of the Western World,' many of which titles are available to read, in one form or another, also online. Deprived of useful intros' by modern writers, such may be read at your local library, or even sitting around Barnes and Noble at quiet, polite, inobtrusive intervals over the weeks and months.    The Harvard Classics should be examined entire, not neglecting the twenty volume Shelf of Fiction, added later to correct ommissions in the previously release set of fifty volumes constituting the original five-foot shelf. Spend the necessary time on these twenty volumes of supplementary fiction, some of obvious selection, to figure out, on the whole, what Eliot was aiming at. Its worth it.    It wouldn't be a horrible mistake to add such as Trostsky's 'History of the Russian Revolution' for its contribution to the understanding of the twentieth century ( not to turn you into a flaming Bolshevik, mind you! ) Joyce's ' Dubliners' ( perhaps the finest collection of short stories, )Rilke's novel 'Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,' Broch's 'Death of Virgil,' Mann's 'Death in Venice,' 'Magic Mtn' and larger 'Joseph and his Bros.' Add Rilke's 'Duino Elegies,'( if only because Cortazar would have it as his desert island reading,) also Rilke: 'Letters to a young poet.' Prousts ' Swanns Way,' yet avoid mastering the rest of 'Remembrance,' as it may keep you swimming in a Francophilic haze for too long, and keep you from discovering the rest of the great twentieth century's novelists like Broch, Mann, Musil. You can always return to the balance of Msr. Prousts magnum opus later.  Borge's 'Dreamtigers,' Durenmatt's 'Physicists' (or other of his witty plays,) Ezra Pound's 'Cantos' and 'Personae,' GMHopkins' poems, WCWilliams' 'Paterson,' TSEliot's 'Four Quartets' and 'Wasteland,' Th Hardy's poems, and the 'Child's Christmas in Wales' and 'Selected poetry' of Dylan Thomas to these.     Indeed, one can expand such a list of useful moderns with some gems, or whatever suitable quality substitutes may be made for them, and evolve a kind of five foot shelf of newbies, and a few oldsters, of our own, not included in either Adler or Eliot. Waltons 'Complete Angler,' Longus 'Daphne et Chloe,' and Johnson's 'Rasselas'( three slender volumes, the first omitted in final release of Eliots' five foot, and the last two considered reads desirable to be read once a year, forever. Read Walton with roman poet Horace, and enrich this overall 'philosophy of relaxation.')   Add Toynbee's 'Study of History' (abridgement,) Werner Jaeger's 'Padeia,' Walter Paters' 'Renaissance,' Eckerman's 'Conversations with Goethe,' Hayek's 'Road to Serfdom,' Merriam Websters 'Readers Handbook,'(more useful than it looks, at first glance )and Benet's readers encyclopedia, or its equivalent. Lyell's 'Geology,' even abridged, illuminates Darwin, his protege of sorts. Make up for Adler's lack of foresight, and Eliot's necessary brevity with the addition of Machiavelli essentials:  Machiavelli's 'Art of War' ( the companion volume to the Prince and discourses, and 'History of Florence;') Giambattista Vico's 'New Science' and possibly the autobio; Russell's ' History of philosophy'( as useful as  Benets readers when attempting to communicate with any eggheads, as they all know it, or have at least assimilated unknown to themselves the point of view it offers. Useful also as a preliminary to filling any lacunae with Copleston's multi-volume 'History of Philosophy,' which you are unlikely own all at once, yet are likely to find worth consulting along the way.)  Add the Golden Bough abridgement (with an eye to perusing Frazers' multi-volume edition with supplements, at some point) Bullfinches Mythology, and David McKays humorous and valuable ' Extraordinary Popular Delusions and Madness of Crowds,'. . .and we begin to see we have the wherewithall to formulate from these varied lists, a five foot shelf of our own to supplement Adler, Eliot, and similar collections.    Add Camus, Sartre,Joyce Carol Oates, Kenneth Patchen, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Wallace Stevens, Kerouac, etc., as you will, to enrich your aura and to cautiously interface with any aesthetic demands of your 'modern' friends and acquaintances. Such familiarity will enable you to politely/indirectly bring your modern reading acquaintances around to the classics, perhaps.    Tedious as a Schopenhauer clone is likely to be, still there are some short stories and poems you ought not to neglect from Luis Borges. Research for yourself.    Schopenhauers' essays and aphorisms are not to be neglected on any account. His 'World as will' volumes can wait for now, perhaps: and his advice about Kant, for most readers, etc: yet you will be glad for his other works. Freud and Jung grew on them. Maybe you can make even better use.     3. Problems with Shakespeare and Chaucer are best conquered, overall,  by spending time with Christopher Marlowe's plays and Spencer's Faerie Queen, and vice versa. Perseverance wins.     4. Last but not least, it should be noted that there is a lament going about, over the neglect of Thomas Love Peacock. Novelist John Fowles himself has expressed his displeasure that Peacock is not read more widely today. Neglect not your Th. Hardy et al (Stevenson thought Hardy wrote some of the finest sentences in all the world's literature); yet I would second Fowle's lament, and recommend the pleasures of reading Peacock's insightful and witty satires, near rival to Jane Austen's, to anyone wishing to have a complete classics experience.     TLPeacock belongs on that list of novelists one ought to make an attempt to read much in their entirety: Dostoevsky ( alright, Tolstoy, if you insist!)Jane Austen, Th. Hardy, Balzac, Rabelais, Manzoni, Cervantes, James Branch Cabell ( yes, perhaps American writing isn't always what it ought to be, yet Cabell makes a good job of it.) If you insist on leaving out Eliot's 'Middlemarch,' you are making a mistake. Many consider it the best English novel: I consider it also one of the foundation understandings of western culture.    And if you didn't add the humor of 'Vanity Fair,' 'Pickwick Papers,' 'Tom Jones,' 'Joseph Andrews, Sterne's 'Sentimental Journey,' ' Tristram Shandy,' and 'Jonathan Wild,' to your Austen and Peacock, why, what a tedious ride your literary journey would be !    With the help of Denby/ Fadiman and such, Adler and Eliot, and the white noise I have presented above, I am at a loss as to how more specifically I would add to your list. Certainly it is a list to dangle the rest of your intellectual development from. Such a list beats floundering indecisively in the stacks of your local public or university library. Select all, Cut and Paste the above to your desktop, and refer often.	2004-01-30
US	39757789	R2CDNMK2LHPJNT	087728301X	946366812	Twelve Steps to Spiritual Enlightenment	Books	5	44	56	N	N	.......NOT just for occult folks, by ANY means !!!	I have a few hesitations abt this book: I think some of th relaxation and body awareness exercises can mess you up, all the while that they make you feel good for a time. Exercises where you try to sense all the minute sensations in your body, can be destructive. The body needs to be aware of itself to some extent, yet awakening too much awareness sensitises nerves which in the long run, are best left not too overly sensitised. Messing with the unconscious in this fashion, isnt the safest thing to do. Yet this is till a useful book.    Also, the exercise where one viualises the body, in a relaxed state, as ' full of holes' may, in the long run, create some real physical problems, as far as I can see. Far better to heed Crowley's advice, and regard or visulaize the body as primarily functioning silently with 'perfect frictionless ease,' each indidividual organ doing its respective task in unison with all the others.    Heed the works of Emma Curtis Hopkins, if you would to learn more on this. Dont be put off by her pollyannish style: the proper spiritualising of the body can do wonders for some people.     In a nutshell: the simple breathing and relaxation exercises set forth in this book are wprth the price of the book alone. and are as good as many such exercises you may find elsewhere.    This little volume is, quite simply, one of the best brief health books one could possibly own.    Embraced within Regardie's intelligent perspective, are a few chapters on breathing, relaxation, and body 'awareness'(you'll have to read the book to find out how useful this is, and how its done,) that are the best little, astute guides to health practices outside of diet, exercise, and advice from a regular, reputable physician.    The care and precision with which Regardie pursues his ideas, contribute to the overall personal sense of intelligent caution that readers should have towards their own health matters in general. Regardie conveys this necessary attitude admirably to thereader.      To top it all off, Regardie includes an excellent, concise version and guide to the basic meditation he utilizes in his highly useful book, \\"The Art of True Healing,\\" currently available in an inexpensive edition, but little modified from its original form, by Marc Allen. I won't even bother to go into how supremely useful this little essay is: just go read the Amazon.com reviews yourself, and you'll see.    Anyone looking to do well with Regardie's \\"Art of True Healing\\" would be wise also, to procure his \\"One-Year Manual.\\" The tips in it on breathing, relaxation, etc., should greatly augment and enhance the \\"True Healing\\" meditation technique for many.    Add Ramacharaka's \\"Science of Breath,\\" and Rama Prasads' \\" Nature's Finer Forces,\\" and you will be adding even more of Regardie's fave resources to gain perspective from.    (New Falcon Press also markets useful recordings - of Regardie himself ! - that assist in the performance of the breathing, 'middle pillar,' body awareness, and relaxation exercises that he pursues in \\"The One Year Manual.\\"     Regardie was a chiropractic by profession, and no doubt utilized many of the simple techniques ofered up in the \\"The One Year Manual\\" with his clients. He also gave lectures and such on relaxation.    The title is really a reference to the fact, that any unified technique or set of techniques designed to improve health and life, generally take about a year to fully master.    The only area this volume falls short, perhaps, is in the value of psychotherapy for both physical, as well as mental health. Regardie elswewhere is a great believer in such, for the beginning occultist, facing the stress of 'alternative' practices.     (I would go further, and add that anyone serious about their physical health, would do well to invest time and resources in some suitable counseling/therapy, as well as pursue physical practices, nutrition, exercise, and meditation.)    I won't even go into how excellently Regardie's methods have come to make me feel, or how they have improved my entire life. I will leave it to you to imagine ...    Regardie's intelligent perspective? Yes - twenty-plus years experience with Regardie's techniques, have shown me that Regardie was even smarter than I thought he was.    There are other Regardie books (\\"Lazy Mans Guide to Relaxation,\\" \\"(Healing) Energy Prayer and Relaxation,\\" ) by Aquarian Press and New Falcon, that are also useful for health/meditation purposes. However, they are currently out of print. No doubt they will be re-released soon.    Even the Golden Dawn large volume, by Llewellyn or Falcon Press, has some breathing/relaxation exercises that those in good health, and cautious, could use to some advantage.    It is my understanding that Weiser/Red Wheel will be re-releasing the \\"One-Year Manual\\" for its current catalog.	2004-01-07

At one point I thought the Llewellyn edition of Regardie's classic had been distorted by 'contributors' (!) leaving the rest of us with no resort except the New Falcon edition of the Golden Dawn, in spite of its higher price.    However, I have since read that New Falcon themselves have been overly tampering with the original Golden Dawn material in this volume, besides adding their own essays and such. We are left with the task of comparing editions, as we venture to make use of the Golden Dawn material. Obviously, we need to compare these 'reissues' with those present before Regardie's death.    Yet this New Falcon edition of the Golden Dawn material also has additional material by Regardie, and additional reading recommendations, variant from the Llewellyn edition. These valuable recommendations will redefine the occult book market for you, and have you going after more of the books Regardie actually thought were important, instead of the misleading plethora of colorful, whacky, glitzy/flashy 'offshoot' books that litter the burgeoning occult market today.    New essays, not included in the Llewellyn edition, by Regardie and others, are featured. Especially valuable are those wherein Regardie touts the necessity of regular, balanced psychotherapy for anyone embarking on Golden Dawn paths, as a preventative of problems and device for gaining self-knowledge.     A useful list of psychology books, apparently approved of by Regardie, was featured in the first edition by New Falcon of the 'Comp Golden Dawn System,' before he died. I do not know if such a list has been maintained as it was, or has been tampered with, thus endangering the spirit and usefulness of Regardie's original advice/recommendations.     Such lists recall those contained in Regardie's much smaller 'Foundations of Practical Magic,' Aquarian Press, which came out some six years before he died. Now out of print, this smaller book featured reading recommendations sprinkled throughout the text, as well as two 10 or 12 item lists of recommended useful books (one list on qabalah, one list on meditation.)    The introductory material in Regardie's smaller book 'Ceremonial Magic,'Aquarian Press, also now unfortunately out of print, featured good advice on introductory material for would-be Golden Dawn practitioners. For example, I was not previously aware that Regardie thought so highly of W.E. Butler. Regardie recommends 'the several books of W. E. Butler, all on the same subject, which are excellent texts for the student to study for a long time.'        At any rate, consulting earlier editions of Regardie's editions of the original Golden Dawn material will transcend the need for the tampered rituals and knowledge lectures in more recent editions.  It will also transcend the need for the hacked Golden Dawn material of dubious authenticity scattered all over the internet.  These derivative pseudo-Golden Dawn phenomena, modified without Regardie's knowledgeable eye, have been deceiving sincere students and researchers left and right.    It would be nice if future editions of the Golden Dawn material, would preserve the original and useful material set forth in the edition before Regardie's death. Maintaining the integrity of that original volume published by New Falcon, circa 1984, they can then add, with enthusiasm, their '150 pages of new material,' and still not cheat the reader by messing about with the edition Regardie at least had a chance to see before it went to press, whilst he was still alive.    Frankly, I wish New Falcon would just leave their 1984 'Regardie - approved' volume alone, and reprint all their new essays they feel are so desirable, into some other seperate volume.    I think what we need is a new Regardie to come forward, and rescue the original material from so many tampering hands, no matter where such tamperers originate from.    . . .at any rate . .     Yet, still don't feel the need for this volume? Then get Regardie's 'The Art of True Healing' book (see reviews,) practice it for awhile, and note results(!!!) You will then surely want to get your hands on this New Falcon 'Complete Golden Dawn' volume, or the other Llewellyn Golden Dawn collection, and all the rest of the Regardie material, even the out-of-print stuff.    Which brings us to another question, there, New Falcon . . .!	2003-12-21

I would add, however, that some of the 'body awareness' and 'visualising the body as full of holes,' which regardie features in some of his books and CDs/ tapes, may be bad, and even dangerous for some people, if only in the long run.  ( see 'Healing Energy Prayer and Relaxation' book, and 'One Year Manual.') Still, Regardie has much of value to contribute. (see my review for the largely useful 'One Year Manual.'    I am suspicious of the consecutive editions of this work since Regardie's death. Llewellyn, occasionally useful publisher of worthy 'occult' volumes, seems to have let Chris Monnastre, or whoever, stick their fingers into this volume, and muddy up some of Regardie's original edition, with dubious revisions of the original material.    Quite frankly, any reprinting of the Golden Dawn material should be left alone,  if only for historical reasons. All over the internet, are versions' of the original Golden Dawn material, recklessly modified this way and that, leaving the sincere student to muddle with poorly documented material, free of Regardie's explanations, as well as free of access to the Golden Dawn material as Regardie knew it. To put it bluntly, I want the Golden Dawn material as Regardie originally knew, compiled, and explained it!     I read on the 'net that the New Falcon Press 'Complete Golden Dawn System' volume, although twice the price, or more, of this Llewellyn 'modified' reprint, is still available. Yet I read that it has been modified, in its subsequent editions, even worse than the Llewellyn edition has been.   Much useful material, exclusive to the Falcon edition, is added. Yet, it is said that Regardie's work has been tampered with in the editions since his death. I don't know what to think. After all is said and done, I wish the New Falcon people would stop adding to and modifying the edition Regardie oversaw before his death, and reprint their 'oh, so marvelous!' new insights into some sort of companion volume.     In short, I am not so sure that there are, as yet, worthy successors to Regardie, or to his original contents and layouts, in either edition !  This is so, in spite of the glitter/wonder boys like DuQuette, who would affect to follow in Regardie's footsteps as types of 'new expounders.'    Also, the past few Llewellyn editions features an index, by David Godwin. I might add a useful thought here, for students: the idea of a Godwin index is a little useless/ superfluous, as it takes time and patience to absorb the Golden Dawn material anyway. Regardie himself advises, 'a few pages a day' at a time. The presence of a large index may have been a fun exercise for compiler David Godwin, but I fail to see how it really makes the material so much easier to master. (Question: did Regardie ever feel an index necessary to his edition of the Golden Dawn materials ? Nowhere have I read that he did.)    In other words, patience is what's needed, not the use of some nervous index, likely to appeal only to the hesitant and unsure, and give them a false idea of the work to endure. What a waste of paper! I would rather they would stick everyone's 'modifications' back on those index pages, and leave Regardie's original text entirely alone !    At any rate, the additions of too much material, and 'addenda/ephemera' to the text, is at least a minor insult to Regardie. It is certainly a major insult to the structure of his work, which may have an integrity and wholeness all its own that ought to be acknowledged and appreciated, before anyone goes messing about with it.    Still, this volume is likely to serve you well, as being closer to the original Golden Dawn material as gathered by Regardie, than unreliable and random ramblings through any dubious websites that offer up the same material.    In the other, New Falcon edition, Regardie expands on the desirable recommended books he felt one should study along with the Golden Dawn material. These include a highly desirable list of recommended psychologyreadings, and also ' Nature's Finer Forces' by Rama Prasad, 'Kundalini' by Gopi Krishna (precious cautionary advice!,) and a few others, as I recall. However, useful recommended reads are also set forth in the Llewellyn edition. One can use these as a 'beginner's guide,' and acquire the 'New Falcon' edition later, following its reading recommendations.    You will need a guide through the occult maze, assuming you set out on it. Regardie provides that guidance.    Certainly one should acquire Regardie's 'Tree of Life' volume (even if it's the Cicero's!) It is in 'The Tree of Life' that Regardie provides the understanding necessary to appreciate the spirit of both the Golden Dawn and the much maligned, yet worthy, Mr. Crowley material. Having done that, one can add 'Gems from the Equinox' to one's bookshelf, the second major important volume to study along with 'The Golden Dawn,' even in the edition set forth by Llewellyn.    Truly, we shall not be setting in gear with Golden Dawn or Regardie to much of anyone's benefit, until more of Regardie's material is reprinted ( and I might add, the magic books of W. E. Butler.) It is in Regardie's various books that guidance is also provided, as well as his recommended readings in various authors, not completely discussed elsewhere.    Enough of this 'word to the wise.' If you have a nose for the best, you will not be distracted by lesser 'occultarians.' and Regardie will appear to be the 'man to go with.' I especially enjoyed having my Llewellyn Golden Dawn (before anyone started to 'revise' it) as I originally started on this road, to augment my work with the 'middle pillar ritual' (see Regardie's 'Art of True healing.') Benefits accrued, as Regardie would say. And they continue to.    Proceed cautiously, but proceed. And don't fall for the 'glitter kids' of the occult scene, before spending some time reading and contemplating Regardie's efforts, and learning to understand and practice them. Complete comprehension will gradually arise, all in good time. As Regardie says in an essay currently out-of-print, though accessible on the internet, ' The benefits are such as to make this effort extremely worthwhile.'    Get your currently preferred edition (Llewellyn's is smaller than New Falcon's) of the Golden Dawn material. Start studying a few pages a day. And practice the Middle Pillar ritual every day, as you will find Regardie recommends in his books. It is a 'sine qua non' of magical practice as Regardie sees it, and practically the entire central essence of his conception of the Golden Dawn.    If anyone has doubts, I reassure the reader that the edition I am (carefully!) working with now, is the 6th edition of Regardie - much as I resent what appear to be a few 'modifications' from previous Golden Dawn editions I have owned! ( At least they solved the 'page 103 misplacement issue' with the inauguration of the  Llewellyn paperback edition.)	2003-12-21

Let us tersely and conveniently sum up the virtues...<br />1. For Golden Dawn people, Regardie describes this volume as the companion to his 'Golden Dawn' collection, whether you prefer the Llewellyn, or the more complete New Falcon Press edition. He does so in his newer introduction to his 'The Tree of Life,' and in another book, no doubt soon to be reprinted, called 'The One Year Manual.'  <br />2. Regardie saw 'Gems' as a permanent addition to the Golden Dawn students shelf. Along with Crowley's original 'Magick in Theory and Practise,' he saw these two volumes as containing an immense amount of worthy material that could take the student a lifetime to assimilate and use.  He makes this observation at the beginning of a volume entitled 'Ceremonial Magic,' hopefully soon to be reprinted.<BR>   The new edition of Crowley's 'Magick' isn't quite what Regardie had in mind for the student. He used to recommend the inexpensive Castle Books edition of 'Magick,' which still occasionally can be found (there is also a smaller paperback Dover books edition floating around, currently out-of-print.) Regardie really wasn't interested in seeing sincere students 'loading themselves down with lots of expensive books.'  <BR>   (Regardie also write a short introduction for an edition of the first 2 parts of the currently available blue covered edition of 'Magick,' back in 1969. I am unaware if this smaller book is still in print.)<BR>   (Part 4 of Book 4 was 'The Equinox of the Gods.' I am unaware of Regardie ever writing any introduction to this book, in any edition. Sangraal Press may have released one in the late 60s/ early 70s. In any event, Regardie does not seem to consider it absolutely essential to understanding the most useful parts of the Crowley corpus. Regardie mentions 'The Equinox of the Gods' but little in his writings.) <br />3. 'Gems' distinguishes itself, as is noted above on this web page in the 'Book Description,' as enabling 'the student to find his way throughthe maze more easily.' It does this by dividing the different materials from the original Equinox into seperate sectioned subject areas within the same volume.<br />4. It is to be noted that Regardie has pointed out that Crowley's personality (!) made his material difficult to properly assimilate for the beginning student - and perhaps for a few advanced students as well. One will find that, in many cases, this is also true for the way Crowley composed much of the magickal material in 'Gems.' Separating the fiery and uneven Crowley from his material becomes part of the difficulty of the project: 'herein the task, herein the toil.'<br />5. New Falcon, at one point in the 80s, reprinted 'Gems' minus a certain amount of Regardie's introductory material. I think this is a mistake. I hate to sound purist, but we ultimately have little enough Regardie material as it is. We are all thankful, however, for New Falcon's Regardie efforts. See my recent review for 'The Complete Golden Dawn' volume published by New Falcon.<br />6. Thelemites will no doubt find 'Gems' useful. The bulk of them, however, will probably opt, at least eventually, for the full set of 'The Equinox' volumes entire.<br />7. As he reprinted much of Crowley's work, Regardie was often consulted or referred to as a Thelemite. Regardie objected to this, and clarified: 'I'm a Golden Dawn man !'<br />8. Many will be glad to know ahead of time, that the version of 'The Vision and the Voice' reprinted in 'Gems,' is not the annotated one that was released later, both in a smaller Regardie edition with intro., and in the later, oversized Weiser Publishers edition ( probably with intro. by the OTOs Hymenaeus Beta.) <br />9. Finally, some of the magick material reprinted in 'Gems' is actually available in the back of the different editions of Crowley's edition of 'Magick.' This makes no difference, as 'Gems' will organize the material more effectively, in the long run, for many students.<br />The above should serve, along with the rest of the present reviews, in encouraging the Golden Dawn student to procure this book as soon as he can, and gradually study it as he would his 'Golden Dawn' material. <br />Remember : sorting out the material is the real challenge here, and gradually assimilating it. One shouldn't rush the process.<br />So, forewarned is forearmed! Get a copy !	2003-12-21

The Marcus Allen edition is quite suitable, and but little modifies Regardie's original text.<br />However, with that said . . .<br />Regardie gives a useful list of some qabalistic books in an essay from a now out of print title, 'Foundations of Practical Magic.' Hopefully, this volume will be soon reprinted.<br />It may be useful for some to note that Regardie, in later years, did not have a particularly high regard for 'Pomegranates,' at least in its earlier edition. It may be even more useful to note, that in his final years, he felt that 'The Mystical Qabalah' book by Dion Fortune, was the best basic introductory book on the subject of qabalah; especially, apparently, for those interested in pursuing the Golden Dawn material.<br />I rather enjoy the original printing of Llewellyn's edition of 'Pomegranates,' released in the mid-80s. It was much more portable than this edition. It including the original essay he wrote for the 70s edition/reprint. However, it is now out of print. <br />I'm such a fan of Regardie's however, that I will probably get this edition also. Especially since the Cicero's, like Pat Zalewski, were apparently friends of Regardie.<br />Now doubt Regardie's effort is more useful in any edition, than the many glitzy/flashy qabalah books that have leaked onto the market, obscuring the subject for some looking for the western magic view on the subject. That is to say, being from Regardie, 'Pomegranates' would still be useful, with or without any comments by the Cicero's. <br />Fan ? Yes, a truly grateful fan. I have 20-plus years experience with the Golden Dawn material, and recommend all of Regardie's writings very highly. The benefits will accrue to you, as they have for me.	2003-12-21
US	39757789	RBKW2K3XUGQQ2	1577310128	987345364	The Art of True Healing: The Unlimited Power of Prayer and Visualization	Books	5	93	95	N	N	on 'the art of true healing': GET THIS NOW!!!	(Revised, corrected: 12/ 25/ '03)  The title is a little misleading. This essay, brief and easily assimilated by any intelligent person, is really about healing any problem in your life, \\"whether it is a problem of character, marriage, health, financial - in fact, any problem type of which one can think.'    first, from the conclusion of Regardie's essay: \\" anything worthwhile abnd likely to succeed requires a great deal of work and perseverance. The Art of True Healing is no exception.\\" There. Now you've got some of the brass tacks, for starters.    (of course, there ARE alternatives . .  the metaphysical/ new thought/new age/ christian science, etc. spiritual healing world is FULL of them. ('Scientific Christian Mental Practice' by Emma Curtis Hopkins is one of my absolute favorites, delightfully awkward title or no.) Yet, Regardie's 'True Healing' is alot less reading, tho both approaches take about a year of practice to show fullest results for efforts. Take your choice.)    Many also attain perfectly decent results with the simplest 'relax, visualize, breath slowly and rhythmically, and practice reciting affirmations til you get the jist of it all ' types of approaches advocated in such books as those of Shakti Gawain ('Creative Visualization.') It's up to you.      Over 20 years familiarity prompts me to offer up these ideas to the newcomer:    1. There is a 'caveat emptor' - the one way to mess up the exercise in this book, is by insufficient relaxation and rhythmic breathing. Be forewarned. As Regardie says: ' Cultivate above all the art of relaxation.' You cannot force the Art of True Healing/middle pillar exercise anyway. Its entire orientation and basis for success, is that of ease and simplicity. It could be added that an overall seriousness of approach, and a fundamentally stable life, provide a good, substantial foundation for this technique.    Dont be put off when Regardie uses phrases like :' We have interfered with the inherent rhythms of nature. And how sadly have we paid for it!\\" Emphasis like this is nice, yet can cause some people to indulge melodramatically in some negative thinking. Such adherence to such ways of putting things, can yield negative results sooner or later.  Firm up your continuity. It is still a valuable essay.B alance in all things. Study intelligently.    2. I am pleased that this book is out in this one-volume edition.  It makes it so much more convenient (especially at such a low price) than just having it on the internet. You can, for reasons of completeness, compare this Marc Allen version here with the original you can currently find on the internet. You will find them quite comparable.    3. Regardie elsewhere in his writings recommends, that you not discuss your work with this exercise with anyone else, as you will then tend not to benefit by it. Don't ask me why. That's just the way it is.( Oh, well... )     4. Regardie also states that the exercise described in 'The Art of True Healing' may take 'far more than a month to master.' As with many techniques, anything like perfect mastery can take about a year. This hardly matters: you will probably start noticing benefits more or less at the outset of this techniques' regular, careful, consistent, and persistent practice. In the essay, towards the end, Regardie states some words to that effect, so have confidence as you set out on this road.    5. The essay is essentially self-contained. Regardie himself, however, is too intelligent to let his work just stand on its own. He recommends in his writings a few useful additions for the 'Art of True Healing' practitioner. Certainly Yogi Ramacharaka's 'Science of Breath,' an old standby/standard that too many people still don't know about, should prove a great help to some people venturing into Regardie's healing technique. Also, Regardie recommends reading Bernard Hollander, MDs 'Hypnosis and Autohypnosis.' I think both of these books are an excellent addition to the libraries of thosewho would practice the technique offered up in 'The Art of True Healing.'    The 'Art of True Healing ' was once contained as the final essay no. 5 in a book entitled Foundations of practical Magic. Truth is, there was much in that book, sprinkled here and there in the other essays contained therein, that provided much food for thought for understanding the 'art of true healing' essay just that much better, also (comparisons with meditation, Jung's Golden Flower , etc.)          Yet, may I make yet one more recommendation? Were Regardie alive, I believe he would be highly pleased with the material to be found in Thomas Cleary's recent 'Taoist Meditation' book (hint: not just for Taoists, and not just for meditators, Cleary's book helps immensely towards relaxation.) Cleary offers up in this book much useful material that would assist many of those interested, in creating the best possible attitude and approach to practicing the middle pillar exercise as depicted in 'The Art of True Healing.' Although I doubt if Cleary had the intention, his 'Taoist Meditation' is still a perfect addition for ' Art of True Healing' practitioners.    6. Many 'versions' of this technique are depicted in other 'occult' and 'visualisation' books. By and large, you should ignore these as incomplete. Regardie's volume is the only 'real McCoy,' that discusses the matter at any kind of length, with the most intelligence and completeness. I have yet to find a decent substitute for 'The Art of True Healing.'    7. As Regardie notes in another book, regular persistent practise will ultimately enable you to perform the exercise described in 'The Art of True Healing' anytime, anywhere. Regardie himself used to practise it back in the 30s, while simply walking around London. (...\\"1930s? hmmm! say! this practise has been around a while, hasn't it?\\" ...yes, indeed, it has...)    8. There exist recordings of Regardie himself performing a fairly complete, though time-condensed, version of this 'Art ofTrue Healing/middle pillar exercise.' In tape form, I have found it a very useful 'middle pillar' aid.    9. Finally, it may be worth noting, for some, that there is a connection between 'The Art of True Healing' essay, and with 'circulation of the energy' material in Jung's 'Secret of the Golden Flower.' One essay hardly substitutes for the other, however.     10. It should be pointed out, that NO form of visualization is a substitiute for psychotherapy, regualr medical treatment, or a sane, rational, stable and balanced approach appropriate to your given lifestyle ( I leave it to you to patiently decide what that might mean, as it applies to you !) Indeed, any form of meditation or visualizing technique ought to be approached with caution. It has been said that, in general, 'the mind must be trained very slowly.' I would add, carefully. Morbid haste or whacky approaches, exotic methods for the sheer sake of 'something different' can be  sheer folly -- even dangerous, for both body and mind. People have rather worked themselves into mental illness with the wrong approaches to their mind and meditation, as they have with regards to their lives and lifestyles. In short, sometimes we simply need to think about our esoteric interests more like accountants, than like wild-eyed New Age messiahs, rushing in madly in billowing flourescent paisley attire. I need not extenuate. I think you get the picture. ' All things in moderation. . .'    Many of you disappointed by other 'Visualization' techniques are likely be highly pleased with 'The Art of True Healing.' Compared to other methods, it can seem a breath of fresh air to the serious practitioner. I agree with one reviewer who said it was the greatest book in the world. Persistence, devotion to its method and steady practise, and a proper attitude, is usually all that's required.     Barring the vagaries of personal indolence and fanaticism that can impair its usefulness, the Art of True Healing/ middle pillar exercise 'is a very powerful technique.' Carefully and assiduously practised, it is 'extremely worthwhile because of the nature and quality of the results which follow,' just like Regardie says near the end of his essay.    In short, BUY THIS BOOK. It is truly worth MANY times its cover price !    (PS: should I ever find anything better, I will be sure to let you know, right here on this review page. But I doubt you are going to find a legitimate method for successful overall integration with, and success within, the significant areas of life, better than 'The Art of True Healing.' So, GET a copy !!!	2003-12-18

(revise/augmented, 1/10/'04)    Great to study 'The Mystical Qabalah' by Dion Fortune after learning the Mid Pillar technique.    Also useful, 'Foundations of Practical Magic,' five essays by Regardie.    From there, I disagree with muddying up the picture with books by Ophiel and sych. Regardie didnt. See his book list he recommends in ' Ceremonial Magic,' Israel Regardie.    For the beginner, we must offer at the outset, that one of Israel Regardie's other books, 'The Art of True Healing,' is the best basic book on the Middle Pillar ritual and its practical uses. Anyone who wishes to make use of the multi-faceted advantages of the Middle Pillar ritual, ought to procure a copy of 'the art of true healing'(check reviews.)    This volume entitled 'The Middle Pillar,' is an expansion on the ritual itself, yet does not offer the overall, integrated assistance as to the utilization of it in body- and life-healing that the 'Art of True Healing' essay offers. It is Regardie's volume entitled 'the art of true healing' that can be used for  'physical body, ...character, financial, marriage, social, and other problems - in fact, any problem type of which one can think...' (Israel Regardie.)    Anyone who knows Regardie's work, probably knows that he still considered this early book \\"useful.\\" Much of it's purpose was taken up by 'The Art of True Healing,' but he still liked it as a tool for students of the Golden Dawn material, and there were plans by New Falcon press to release Regardie's revision ( entitled 'Sceptre of Power,' I believe) somewhere in the past twenty years. Did they ever do so ? I don't know.    The only thing that bothers me about the Cicero editions of Regardie is, I am still not sure Regardie would approve. They make his books more expensive to get, and I am not so sure Regardie had any such intention. Better to focus your resources on acquiring the large 'Complete Golden Dawn System' book from New Falcon Press that Regardie had issued before he died, orthe Llewellyn edition. Falcons editiion is Regardie's revised edition of the Golden Dawn rituals, and is to be preferred over the Llewellyn edition, which since Regardie's death has been 'worked over, 'annotated,' and modified to some extent, by newer 'contributors.' I truly wish people would just leave the original material alone... this goes for Regardie's 'Middle Pillar' book as well.    What the reader hopes, however, is that whatever the editor/annotator's vagaries, they at least knew Regardie. Thereby, they may have something to offer up with their 'additions' and 'innovations' which mirrors some of the 'crumbs from the masters table' Regardie may have been able to transfer to such as the Cicero's. The careful reader, hopefully, may thereby be rewarded.    Actually, and its worth mentioning: the high praise RA Gilbert offers up on the back cover of this new edition of 'M Pillar.' This is encouraging, as it is my understanding that Regardie largely approved of RA Gilbert, at least as far as his efforts as Golden Dawn historian are concerned. Not all Cicero editions of Regardie's work enjoy such endorsements, apparently: the Francis King endorsement appearing on the new, larger Cicero edition of 'The Tree of Life,' is really an endorsement of the original edition, unadorned by the Ciceros. It therefore cannot be construed as an endoresement of the Cicero's editorial and annotationial efforts on Regardie's original.    At this juncture, I must register another protest. All this modifying of Regardie's original text, seems to me a bit dangerous. The assumption that Regardie was too difficult, or wrote in an outdated 1930s style, or something like that, is short sighted. The material must be gone over and over again, to make real useful sense of it. Attempts to abridge or shorten the process of real work, as Regardie originally perceived it, is a denial of this.     I won't blame Llewellyn too much, as they have a right to make a living generating books for the not-too-serious occultist. However, why Regardie must endure insipid popularization, seems questionable to me.         However, if this edition includes new Regardie material, I am interested. (Apparently, they at least left his introductory material intact.)I probably will get a copy eventually anyway, as I got rid of my Llewellyn edition copy I got in the late 80s, and have missed it ever since (it was smaller, more convenient, and largely a reprint of the 30s edition with additional Regardie material from the early 70s.)    It may be presumptuous of me to consider the Cicero's as superfluous. They may be entirely approved of by Regardie, wherever he is now! (RIP.) Regardie may have intended for some like the Cicero's to carry the banner.     Still, basically, all you need is the Golden Dawn volume, several of Regardie's books, and the ten or twenty other books, (many of them non-occult), like Reich's 'Function of the Orgasm,' Jung's 'Two Essays in Analytical Psychology,' Rama Prasad's 'Nature's Finer Forces, ' Frater Albertus's 'Alchemists Handbook,' Dion Fortune's 'Mystical Qabalah,' several psychology books recommended in the New Falcon 'Complete Golden Dawn System' book, or the shorter list provided in his 1968 introduction included in the current Llewellyn edition, the several basic books on magic by W. E. Butler (hopefully soon to be reprinted) and some others. However, as Regardie suggests in an out of print title ('Ceremonial Magic,' Aquarian Books, hopefully soon to be reprinted ), the purpose of all this work is not to overburden the student with tons of 'expensive books.'    These are the reasons I find the bulking out of Regardie's books so objectionable. He has a lot of other recommendations for 'the foundations of a sound occult library' as it is already.    Still, the presence of these larger editions, may at least, in a colorful and somewhat superficial way, serve to draw attention to Regardie's work overall. When that process has completed itself forthe present population, perhaps we may see re-releases of Regardie's original editions, hopefully in the original typefaces, for us authenticity-seeking purists ! (It's a little tedious for people to be circulating home made photocopies of the older material.)     Admittedly, some of the new writers, like the Cicero's, may be making a worthwhile contribution. I would be a purist, however. I do not wish, at least initially, to stray too far from Regardie's original efforts, as he was very bright. By the mid 80s, he had also lavished the better part of his 70-plus years lifetime on these techniques.  I would not want to stray too far, at least at first, from his initial recommendations.    (Actually, my role as 'purist' comes not from fanaticism, but from over twenty years of studying Regardie, burning my fingers until I realized the intelligent unity of his overall work. I would transfer the understanding of that unity to anyone sincerely interested in Regardie.)      If you really want to know the basics, there are two essential volumes. Regardie would have you own the Golden Dawn, either in the new Falcon or an older, unmodified Llewellyn ( I can't believe Regardie would approve of messing with the original Golden Dawn material the way Llewellyn has let some do) and a copy of his 'Gems from the Equinox,' a book of Crowley's magic material, arranged so the student 'can make his way through the maze more easily.'  You can read about Regardie's view on the place of these two volumes in the student's library, in his introductions both to 'The Tree of Life,' and in his 'One-Year Manual,' no doubt also soon to be reprinted, as people rediscover Regardie.    (Those who wonder why Regardie would have ought to do with Crowley, haven't spent enough time with the material to figure out why yet. Earn the privilege of understanding! Pay your dues! I think you may find it well worth it, to understand Regardie's practical view, on just about everything, really.)    Still, I willprobably get this new edition of 'The Middle Pillar,' as it is still worthwhile, and as the page quantity is tempting ( seems to be twice as long as the earlier edition) and because no other editions seem to be available at this time.	2003-12-13

Additional things to know about 'Magic Without Tears' :<br />1. Some letters are missing. Karl Germer lost them, intentionally or otherwise.( One, was erntitled 'On Pain, ' or something like that.)<br />2. In a large, flat, oversized book about Crowley, published about ten years ago or so, Kenneth Grant, the original secretary for these letters, published a few paragraphs he had left from a notebook, of material that was meant to be included in one particular letter.<br />3. A good number of these letters were never actually sent to anyone. They came from Crowley's head as ideas, and they were put down on paper in letter form. The myth of enquiring, or even begging, recipients, has no basis in fact.<BR>   This does not, however, negate the value of the letters. <BR>   Crowley wrote many letters all his life. These have yet to be collected in volume form. The bulk of the 'Tears' letters were addressed to a reading public, or potential students of Thelema, rather than to some paying 'student.' They are a kind of 'debt to posterity' or what-not, of Crowley.<br />4. I enjoy Regardie's intro. and perspective on this book, and his advice on how to read it. However, the unedited letters make a great read. They are even more enlightening than the edited Regardie edition. These unedited, may be read online.<br />5. The original edition was printed in a rather limited edition, on 8 1/2 by 11 inch typewriter paper, probably mimeographed, and bound together. Such a facsimile would be interesting to see. Yet, any complete, bound edition would be great to have. This is so, however worthy Regardie's intro. and editing efforts are for the present New Falcon edition.<br />There are other issues/controversies surrounding this book. The above comes from my own research, various sources. Regardie's edition is handy, and still worth acquiring, whether you are a Thelemite, a 'Golden Dawn man' like Regardie, or generally interested in an educational 'good read.'<br />Me? I got my copy 20years ago, back when 'New Falcon Press' was still called 'Falcon Press.' I enjoy it very much, glued it back together once, and still have it.	2003-12-12

When I first read the Israel Regardie edition of THE LAW IS FOR ALL, my mind was essentially exploding in every direction. I was relatively inexperienced with reading (what were to me) such exciting pyrotechnics.<br />However, this stuff can be a little TOO exciting. One can't guarantee what such things do to an average mind -and life- like mine was (is ?) Just like one can have initial disasters from playing around with Tarot cards, or magick and occultism in general, read Aleister Crowley with caution! (I.e., W E Butler writes in his book 'The Magician,' that those interested in studying magic read rather alot of other books first (he gives a list.) Then he asserts, one may be able to \\"deal selectively\\" with Crowley's writings.<br />Take it from one who has been reading Crowley for 20-plus years: Butler's is good advice !!! Israel Regardie, Dion Fortune, Franz Hartmann and others are to be recommended before soaking oneself in too much Crowley, too quickly.  <br />In any event, I suspect this volume to be rather sanitized, if it is as edited as people say. Fortunately, much of it can be read online, from another edition. And it is still useful and convenient to have some of the Commentary in this bound form.<br />What I personally did, was get a hold of a copy of a larger edition of the same material, edited by Kenneth Grant and John Symonds. I photocopied this rare (hardcover)edition from a friend, and added the missing pages from my Regardie edition of 'Law is for All', as published by Falcon Press in the early 80s. I might recommend that those interested, do the same, if they can, to make sure they get as much of the Commentary as might be authentic.	2003-12-12

I keep it on my shelf, along with Emma Curtis Hopkins' \\"High Mysticism,\\" and \\"Christian Science Mental Practice.\\" She was a great believer in the arts of breathing, and has much to offer on this, especially in the High Mysticism volume.     I can't speak for this edition, but assuming it still has the basic contents of the older small hardcover edition, whatever additions it may have, it would still be incredibly useful.     It is also incredibly pleasant to read. I used to own a copy, benefitted from it, for some reason got rid of it, and then repurchased one a few weeks ago. Last night I turned to it, started reading it, and was reminded what an excellent and useful little volume it was. I practised some of the exercises, and my enthusiasm for these techniques was renewed. I read myself to sleep on it. In short, I love this little book, and wish everyone would own a copy, study, and practice it.    I first came to Ramacharaka's Breath book, as a recommendation from an Israel Regardie book. Regardie was a chiropractic who used rhythmic breathing, and relaxation techniques with his patients. Much of Regardie's writing is replete with useful info. on that score ( see his 'The Art of True Healing,'for example.) Many of Regardie's useful books are out of print, however, making Ramacharaka and Co's. 'Science of Breath' book even more essential.    ...but don't stop there ...     In addition to 'Science of Breath,' might I recommend that the curious reader, looking to enrich and bolster his/her health, check out an excellent, if more recent, book by Thomas Cleary: 'Taoist Meditation.' Truly, you do NOT have to be a Taoist to benefit healthwise from this book ( check reviews.) Michael Saso's 'The Gold Pavilion' is also a book I wouldn't want to be without, and depicts what is probably the safest of all the oriental alchemy techniques I have found yet in theliterature. Both these books supplement Ramacharaka perfectly, in my opinion.     From there, you can turn to Rama Prasad's 'Nature's Finer Forces,' considered a 'must-have' by Regardie, and called \\"the best book on breathing\\" by its current publisher.    ...but see my recent review (note dates) for Carl Simonton, MDs' 'Getting Well Again,' a volume also not to be ignored by those health-seekers and preservers (prevention being a big part of the health game.) In my review, I list about a dozen useful books, along with Ramacharaka's, that belong on anyone's health bookshelf.    Generally, what you want, is a wide variety of perspectives on health issues.    Of course, the caveat applies in all these matters: never should any of these techniques be used as a substitute for regular professional care by a certified, reputable physician. Books like Ramacharaka's, it bears repeating for some, are supplements, not substitutes.    (Note: Ramacharaka's book is not difficult, and in spite of its Eastern perspective, is not in the same league as the more dangerous oriental alchemy techniques discussed in some books, such as those of Eva Wong, valuable as they are. The two phenomena ought not to be confused, by and large. In short, oriental alchemy is generally for the few, while Ramacharaka's book with exercises is useful for just about anybody.)	2003-12-07
US	39757789	R14IXK16RBLMHF	0393311651	375620968	Self-Analysis	Books	5	60	65	N	N	ultimately the looming Karen Horney volume . . .	Don't be fooled or put off by this excellent volumes' small size!    Having disposed of the current mass resistance to psychoanalysis, one can be ready for the works of Karen Horney. She is, after all, what all our current 'popular' psych. writers have cut their teeth on, a good part of the time. Her dissociation from some dimensions of Freud notwithstanding, many will find all her books very useful. I have re-read them all several times, and currently am working with SELF-ANALYSIS. It is full of useful accounts ('case history' material) that are quite useful, and deserving of many re-readings.    It also has a generous supply of necessary aphorisms for analysis, blended with the text. One could make a list of them. I bet such a list would constitute a useful outline for study of her book.    Yes, the SELF-ANALYSIS volume can be opaque in many respects, at first. It does require re-readings, at least for the beginner. It is, however, an excellent hook to hang your analytical hat from. Once determined to get from psychology in general, and the works of Karen Horney specifically, all they are worth, this book will become a standby for overcoming mental obstacles to sanity and health. Nobody can walk away from a thorough and honest assimilation of Karen Horney's books without a richer, sunnier, more positive and optimistic outlook on human psychology and life. This is entirely apart from the basic foundation/springboard one can get from Karen Horney for further psychotherapeutic reading and study.    Although written years ago, Karen Horney's books lack the shrillness and lesser professionalism of many popular psychology writers.  At the same time, she makes many basic truths and understandings of psychology practical, workable. This is an advantage over more advanced writers in psychoanalysis. You can get alot out of reading Karen Horney without wading through the greater complexities of, say, Otto Fenichel, Edward Kempf, Edward Bleuler, and other writers on psychoanalysis, who may intimidate new readers by an apparent initial lack of explication. (You can turn to such writers later. And I would highly recommend the three I have here mentioned. Horney's list she includes in the first few sectons seems a mite incomplete. )    Whatever her flaws, she communicates much of the stability and sobriety with regards to psychology, and life itself, that Clara M. Thompson does ('Interpersonal Psychoanalysis', Basic Books.) Our popular psych. writers to the contrary, it is pleasurable to learn psychology as something besides a circus, or perhaps a superficial ego-gratificaton festival.    (Worthy introductions of a classical type abound. Anna Freud's 'The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense' is one of the best, short, concise, sane introductions to any personal psychology studies whatsoever. Her fathers' 'Interp. of Dreams' may be gleaned to advantage, yet may take awhile to assimilate in its largesse: I would suggest, by and large, going for his ' Psychopathology of Everyday Life,' a briefer text, for your beginning readings of psychoanalysis. Eventually you will add the rest of Freud, and others.     Might I also suggest that you add to Karen Horney, Theodore Reik's 'Listening with the Third Ear,' Jung's 'Two Essays on Analytical Psychology,' and ' Man and His Symbols,'  Fenichel's 'Psa. theory of the Neuroses,' Eduard Bleuler's ' Demenetia Praexox, the Group of Scizophrenias,' Helene Deutsch's two-vol 'Psychology of Women,' and Franz Alexander's 'Psychosomatic Medicine,' to your basic psychology studies ? - readings like these can 'walk you over' to the saner side of psychology. Even such as Georg Groddeck's 'Book of the It,' in spite of the eccentricity of both author and text, could prove quite useful and enlightening. Brenner's plodding  intro, 'An Elementary Textbk. of Psychoanalysis,' revised since the 1950s, also may prove useful to many.     It is advised that, thru all this democratic selection of readings, chosen despite greaterand lesser difficulties and vagaries, one should avoid becoming dogmatic, and focus instead on comparing and contrasting ideas, for a long time.  This is essential for objectivity and proper application. It is a discreet, non-fanatical, commonsense, yet  pleasurable and confident overall reinforcement of your observational skills, that you should want to acquire. ' All things in moderation!' and 'Fanaticism is above all to be eschewed.' If this sounds like learning about life, so it is: psych. is rather like that.       To swallow mamy of these texts whole, without forethought and discrimination, would be a mistake. without a thoughtful maintenance of distance from them before making them part and parcel of one's overall inegrated understanding, is essential if one is to study and understand them. )    Horney offers a useful recommended reading list in the first part of SELF-ANALYSIS for the beginner.   Yet all of Karen Horney's books themselves should be read by those interested in understanding self and others. They make the reader take that undogmatic 'one step back fom life,' so necessary for an understanding of psychology, that allows one to access necessary objectivity and calm towards life and self.     I always recommend Karen Horney as a 'sin qua non,' even for more advanced readers in the realm of psychology. Her general appeal, as well as her sober, non-flashy approach, is also useful for those who wish to apply preventatives against potential mental illness problems arising in their own lives, for now and the future.    I might, however, recommend getting Karen Horney's other books first, and reading those before concentrating on the SELF-ANALYSIS volume. In truth, all of Karen Horney's books deserve a place on anyone's health bookshelf. You won't be making a mistake by putting them there.    (as an aside: what we need is a one-volume edition of a half-dozen of her earlier volumes, for convenience, and to alert readers more immediately and thoroughly tothe fact that she wrote more than one or two books.)      To put it simply, Karen Horney has yet to be replaced, either as a psychology writer, or as a general necessity.	2003-11-26

Yet anyone who knows anything about health, knows of the power of mind to heal body. They also know that you keep all your options open, whilst never casting caution to the winds, surrendering obliviously to any sort of passing faddism.    Simonton's book is the best over-all guide to mind-body healing I have seen, and I am as contemptuous of unproven 'alternatives' and new-age drivel as anyone.    Yet, Simonton's isn't the only volume for your health bookshelf. His book recommends others for the average reader.    I might also suggest you add a few others:     - cancer-survivor Louise L. Hay, \\"Heal Your Body\\";   - Shakti Gawain's basic \\"Creative Visualization,\\" useful if somewhat 'new-agey';   - Thomas Cleary's recent \\"Taoist Meditation\\"(not just for Taoists by a longshot);   - Joel Goldsmith's older \\"The Art of Spiritual Healing,\\" now in trade paperback;   - Bernard Hollander MDs' classic, \\"Hypnosis and Self-Hypnosis\\";   - Yogi Ramacharaka's older \\"Science of Breath,\\" not to be ignored becuase of the authors' name or because of the strange title;     Rama Prasad's \\"Nature's Finer Forces\\" if you're getting even more ambitious about breathing;   - Franz Alexander \\"Psychosomatic Medicine.\\"  - Henry Bieler MD, \\"Food Is Your Best Medicine\\"  - everything you can get your hands on by Carlton Fredericks.  - Michael Saso, \\"The Gold Pavilion,\\" the safest book I know of to begin working with oriental alchemy, relaxation, visualisation and breathing techniques useful for health and well-being, mental or physical;    -Israel Regardie, \\"The Art of True Healing,\\" useful for health, relaxation, rhythmic breathing, and a score of other purposes, healing alot of areas of your life (see reviews;)    -everything by Karen Horney (yes, psychology has alot to do with physical health;)    -Carl Jung, \\"Two Essays on Analytical Psychology,\\" alot more useful that it sounds, everyone should read it and have it around for re-reading;    - anything by Theodore Reik, paricularly \\"Listening With the Third Ear,\\" and any other good psychology writers (Erik Erikson, Otto Fenichel) you may find, and that come highly recommended.     - and, so little mentioned by new agers, tho they are oft in her debt (directly or indirectly), Emma Curtis Hopkin's  classic 'Scientific Christian Mental Practice,' in spite of awkward title and slightly difficult text, has taught me more of spirit healing than any other book I have read.       There are others. There are some volumes by Israel Regardie, now out of print, that speak quite excellently to the issues of relaxation, rhythmic breathing, etc., with regards to health. It would be nice to see these re-issued. In the meantime, Regardie's \\"Art of True Healing\\" may prove useful to many. There are also Regardie's useful discs/tapes that discuss body 'awareness,' relaxation, and rhythmic breathing - all of which may be much more useful than they intitially seem to the uninitiated or casual onlooker.    These books should sit on your shelf next to your more traditional health books, like Andrew Weil, Bernie Siegel, and any of the many standard health guides, usually bulky,   like those from Rodale Press /Prevention, and others (Harvard Medical School bulky general guides, etc.)     Conventionality should not, always and universally, be regarded as poison. Neither should 'alternatives' always be regarded as 'channelled sacred messages from beyond.' A wholesome smorgasbord of reliable outlooks and perspectives are what one is after.    Remember, its a broad outlook on health, lifestyle and its influences, and psychological effects on health, that we seek. Simonton's book, for example, is useful for this. Yet trends, fashions, 'magic healers,' quacks, and high-falutin' theories need to be seen for what they are, when considering health issues. Since \\"Fanaticism is above all to be eschewed,\\"says Regardie, one should also be in the care of a competent, reputable, and reliable physician.     Its your health. Take the upper hand in your own health. You are responsible. Dont mess around. Dont fall for the tricks, dont believe the hype, use your cautious common sense. You're all grown up now.    It is usually foolish to do anything entirely on one's own hook. This is especially true in the area of health and medicine. This is so even for those who insist that 'if you want anything done right, do it yourself.' Individualism has its limits, like anything else.    One is best off with a balanced view. An overall health-orientated lifestyle is best. I would not forego the use of adaquate diet, vitamins, rest, moderate exercise, psychotherapeutic counseling, and a balanced lifestyle free of negative influences whether of person or place. Yet I wouldn't sacrifice my health on the altar of some frenzied, poorly considered 'alternatives' either. The overall dedication of oneself to a therapeutic lifestyle that anticipates future difficulty while dealing with the present, and considers the vast array of options, is the best approach. Believe me, there are worse ways to spend ones' time.    Simonton's book fills the bill and answers a need, if put in proper perspective. It should be read also by those who have no real health problems at the moment, to enrich a disease-preventative understanding. (Plan Ahead!)	2003-11-22

Sometimes the compant we keep, the people we know are wrong for us, and are helping to keep us ill. Lifestyle is a factor. Much modern ill-health stems from stress, as much as it does from bad eating, heredity, and other factors. Works on psychosomatic medicine may be useful for some, also. Even the realm of so-called spiritual healing may have much to offer. <br />I refer the interested, who are wisely trying to 'cover the ground, and leave no stone unturned,' to consult Joel Goldsmith's classic, 'Art of Spiritual Healing,' and Louise L. Hays' 'Heal Your Body,' for some other useful points of view. These may prove helpful in the search for health, in spite of some people's opinions that they are 'nut books.'<br />Of course, any books on relaxation and stress reduction may also prove useful. One other very useful, recent source is Thomas Cleary's excellent 'Taoist Meditation.' Don't be put off by the ancient oriental religion angle of this title. It is NOT just for fashionable, trendy New Age types, or what-not. You will find this volume quite useful with regards to relaxation and health, just by reading it. You don't have to be a Taoist or any kind of meditator to benefit.<br />I own 3 or 4 Carlton Fredericks books. Add Dr. Bieler's older, 'Food is your Best Medicine' to your shelf, also. I wouldn't want to do without my copy of that book, either.<br />See also my recent reviews for Eva Wong's books, and the older classic, 'Japanese Cult of Tranquillity' by Durckheim, for further, non-nutritional information useful for stress reduction, relaxation and lifestyle conduct issues.	2003-09-14

The first half of this book is worth the price of the whole thing. In fact, it is more than worth it.<br />This is not about any cult, cults, or cultism. It is also not just a book for orientalists or sinophiles. A more accurate title might have been 'The Japanese CULTURE of Tranquillity.' Of course, we know Japan today to be a hotbed of business-orientated activity. But it is the classical spirit of Japanese propriety to which the author speaks, and from which westerners may derive alot of benefit, in order to put our hasty lifestyles into a healthier perspective. Durckheim augments our understanding of Japanese orientation to the everyday hustle-bustle, in a way westerners can find very useful.<br />This book will not be leaving my collection too quickly. However, many will find Thomas Cleary's recent 'Taoist Meditation' volume of selections also very useful. Perhaps even moreso than Durckheim's essay. Cleary's volume includes some immensely useful perspectives, from classical Taoist texts, that should prove of great value to those seeking deeply into health and relaxation issues.<br />Many will find the perspectives offered in Michael Saso's 'The Gold Pavilion' also very useful, in spite of its price. I won't be getting rid of my copy of that gem of a book either, for quite some time! It is too valuable for health issues, and contributes, like the two previous mentioned volumes, greatly to an understanding of attitudes, health, and the value of relaxation. This is entirely apart from its usefulness as an assist to meditation.<br />The latter half of Durckheim's book appears to concern martial arts. I have not assessed it completely: but no matter. As I said, the first half of 'The Japanese Cult of Tranquility' is more than worth the trouble of procuring it for the reader interested in their personal health.<br />... for additional info, please see my recent reviews, from August/September 2003, on the Taoist books of Eva Wong, and my review for Cleary's 'Taoist Meditation.'<br />Remember, you don't have to be a major Taoist or meditator, to benefit from the perspectives offered up in these books.	2003-09-08

This old 'standby of a standard' book is recommended as a 'must,' or required reading, by Israel Regardie in the Complete Golden Dawn system of Magic, published by New Falcon.<br />It may also be useful when studying matters of Taoist Immortalist Alchemy and such, for comparison purposes. Doctrines of cycles, etc., of both this book and Michael Saso's, Thomas Cleary's, Livia Kohn's, Stuart Olson's, Charles Luk's(Lu Ku'an Yu), and Eva Wong's translations of Taoist alchemical texts, may bear useful comparison. Those studying Tibetan arts of healing may also benefit.<br />One may also be interested in consulting Ramacharaka's brief but useful 'Science of Breath,' and the more recent Huang and Wurmbrand 'Primordial Breath(2 volumes.)'	2003-09-07

Enough of the abuse of this book!<br />The extensive recommended reading list in the back of this book is worth the price of the whole thing.<br />Whatever Wong's vagaries, the extended explanations for further readings at the end of the various sections of the text itself, make this still a useful volume.<br />However, if you are going after Wong, and Taoist Health and Longevity issues, you may prefer to start with 'Cultivating Stillness,' 'The Tao of Health, Longevity, and Immortality,' and/or 'Cultivating the Energy of Life,'her translation of the 'Secret of the Golden Flower' ( for discussion of the usefulness of comparing the translations of which, see this 'Shamabala Guide to Taoism.')<br />But see my recent reviews (note dates) for Wong's 'Tao of Health, etc.' and Thomas Cleary's 'Taoist Meditation' for further amplification of these issues, particularly with regard to health.<br />Many volumes, in spite of vagaries, generalities, and such, are still incredibly useful for their recommended reading suggestions and guides. Wong's worthy volume is one such. In addition to her volumes suggested above, I would highly recommend it for further research. It's handy as a guide to Kohn's, Robinet's, Charles Luk's, Cleary's, Olson's, and other writers/translators on these subjects. Go for it.	2003-09-01

I have delighted in this and other oriental 'translations' by Cleary, Wong, and others (Japanese Cult of Tranquility, Durkheim; 'Nature's Finer forces, Rama Prasad, readable online.) Some of this advice about breathing and perspectives on health is somewhat useful. Israel Regardie's books, and Rama Charakas' 'Science of Breath' is also good.    However, I must put forth that Emma Curtis Hopkins' 'Scientific Christian Mental Practice' is one of the finest things I have ever read in this direction. I would also add the new edition of 'High Mysticism ' from the DESERT CHURCH OF THE LEARNING lIGHT in Ohio, and her pamphlet ' The Resurrection.'	2003-08-30

(Revised with additions, 8/26/03)<br />This edition is about as big as an original copy of Tree of Life as i saw it in a used book store twenty years ago. Its clinky, tho: sort of wish I had my old original again. It was smaller and more convenient to pull off the shelf and read. The notes arent half bad, tho.<br /><br />Read and learn. Also, get, and practice, Regardie's 'Art of True Healing,' still available in a useful, functional edition, but little modified by Mark Allen. Well worth your bother! Cannot be recommended more highly: the Middle Pillar 'ritual' is integral to the Regardie material, and is much more practical than it sounds.<br /><br />Yet, some have little interest in matters purely/strictly occult. Occultism isn't necessarily the only reason one studies Regardie. Throughout all his books, a useful perspective on the world of psychology is offered. You may not care for western magic, Egyptian gods considered as symbols of the mind, spirit, etc.<br /><br />However, Regardie, although by repute no master 'shrink' himself, offers many useful points of view on psychology and psychotherapy throughout his many books. His sanity and objectivity shine through, little handicapped by personal idiosyncracy. His reading lists can be useful. His 'Teachers of Fulfillment,' currently out of print, I hope to see reprinted soon. It offers a kind of 'Tree of Life' quality coverage on the New Thought ' metaphysical' movement, offering what I think are very useful insights into this movement. 'Energy, Prayer, and Relaxation' is another cognate volume, offering a variant on the 'Art of True Healing' method, and is a useful introduction to such methods/practices.<br /><br />His 'One Year Manual' also stands well next to these. It is a blend of methods and techniques to be used by the individual, not only for health but for personal self-development as well, spiritual and otherwise. To me, it is an extremely practical work. The small but important and essential practise of 'self-recollection' as described therein has proved invaluable to me. It deserves a small book all to itself.<br /><br />Add the essay on 'Meditation' from his 'Foundations of Practical Magic' ( out of print, but also no doubt soon to be re-released, ) well-known and admired among the cognoscenti, and you start to have a very well-rounded grounding/perspective indeed. This is a grounding and orientation of occultism, integrating psychology in general, to form a surprisingly unified whole, and a more than suitable springboard for the individual interested in steadily and carefully pursuing a course of action destined to change his/her life.<br /><br />The recommended reading list of W.E.Butlers handbooks, etc. on an early page of 'Ceremonial Magic,' the non-occult but tremendously useful 'Lazy Man's Guide to Relaxation,' are two other Regardie books no doubt soon to be reprinted as demand increases. Also, Regardie recommends having on hand a copy of Jungs 'Two Essays on Analytical Psychology' on hand, to supplement all these general studies.<br /><br />Frater Albertus' 'Alchemist's Handbook,' featuring an introduction by Regardie, usefully supplements the Golden Dawn material on the Internet. However, you should also familiarize yourself with Regardie introductions to the general Golden Dawn material, found in the two different published book collections of the Golden Dawn.<br /><br />Korzybski's books on semantics (aka: neuro-semantics) also contributes its moiety to the complete Regardie picture. See also Regardie's introduction to Edwin Steinbrecher's 'Inner Guide Meditation,' for an even further expansion of and familiarity with Regardie's realm and point-of-view.<br /><br />Also on the horizon is 'Regardie Speaks,' useful for getting a further grasp on his ideas. After all these, you will know where to go next.<br /><br />Read his books. Read his recommendations. Read introductions he has written for others. You won't regret it. The methods are not to be rushed into, as they can be quite powerful and useful. Sanity must guide the path and, as Regardie would say, 'fanaticism above all is to be eschewed.'<br /><br />Add to all this his useful recordings, in particular the 'Middle Pillar Ritual' recording, useful with the 'Art of True Healing' essay, and his 'Body Awareness/Relaxation' recording, and you are well on your way.<br /><br />The quiet intelligence, caution, and subtlety which pervades his books, is something I always look for in a writer, as in J. Krishnamurti, and others.<br />Those looking for a new perspective on life would do well to investigate his work.<br /><br />Although I have since added in to the picture a moiety of Taoist immortalist classics to my 'armementarium,' I am constantly returning to Regardie. ( Taoist health techniques as in Eva Wong, Thomas Cleary and the like, I feel is the direction people like Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, Bernie Siegel, writers on the Qi-Jong, Feng Shui, and similar efforts are headed.) Enrich your appreciation and understanding of other psychology and 'self-improvement ' writings, by improving the entire picture for yourself, with Regardie.<br /><br />You'll be glad you did. It just might be 'more rewarding than watching television,' or pursuing lesser, although 'flashier' writers on personal psychology/human potential and development subjects.ath and, as Regardie would say, 'fanaticism above all is to be eschewed.'

Quite simply, one of the best nutritionists there ever was...<br />Rational, sane, and coherent, follow Carlton Fredericks' advice: and read the other nutrition authors he recommends. <br />One place he falls short, is the environmental and psychological impact on health. All is not in food. One needs to get the unhealthy stresses and influences out of one's life. The issue, for example, of the company we keep, and its impact on our health, is not emphasised enough in his work.<br />But his dietary advice is intelligent, discretionary, and diverse. Fredericks is no 'food faddist.' Follow his advice, and you are well on the road to better health.<br />I wouldn't be without the Carlton Frederick's books I own, and always look to acquire more when I can find them. Heed his food advice. Heed his supplement advice. Believe me, you won't regret it. A truly worthy investment, from all points of view. And with all his well-researched expertise, he's got a sense of humor, too!	2003-06-17

I used this set of books to cure myself of various dimensions of my own illiteracy.<br /><br />Suffering from a lack, perhaps, of desirable introductions featured in other editions of the same works, the consistency of printed style makes it slightly more accessible for a serious reader. The overall aesthetics of the set may add to speed and comprehension.<br /><br />Some of this set will seem, for many, a review of good high school studies. I would not necessarily read every word : page thru, and see what catches your eye ... then go back and study more thoroughly what needs to be.<br /><br />Yet there are others I would have included, though Adler had his reasons. There's  Robert Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy,'  Vico's 'New Science,'<br />Kant's *complete*  ' Critique of Pure Reason' and 'Prolegomena,' Spengler's 'Decline of the West(start with the abridged,)'  and read different sections of  Lyell's Geologies  online every so often, to get a backround for your Darwin reading.  And why not Arthur Conan Doyle, complete ?  Werner Jaeger's  'Padeia' (3 vol)may be expensive, even in paperback, yet it's a great addition and keepsake/reference on the classical world.  These additions will enrich your shelf for you, I trust.  They broaden the view, flesh out the understanding, enhance and enrich the overall perspective from every angle.  The grey type on so many pages turns into a huge historical/philosophical/literary map with these additions.  With the GBWesternWorld, these additions help form a great broad overview to gently range the mind over, til  'this matter of culture'  begins to fall into place.<br /><br />yet dont try to read everything all at once, in a great and rapid hurry. Reading shld be more of a ballet than a racing competition, than it so often is. Organize yourself with grace, wisdom, strength.<br /><br />Lane has a great music history book, a thousand pp., from the 1940s thats a great addition to anyone's personal library. Grove has a highly recommended opera volume, (tho I do not yet personally own it.) Siegfried Kracauer's 'Theory of Film' may be hard to get into right away, yet is such a staple in my library, I have yet to find a substitute for it, large or small: let it be the axle whereby you come to know the 'art form of the twentieth century,' through other film books, older or newer, greater or lesser in size or seeming usefulness.<br /><br />... and start to familiarize yourself with such readings as  Joyce's ULYSSES,  FINNEGAN'S WAKE, Prousts' REMEMBRANCE,  and Musil's MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES,  Mann's MAGIC MOUNTAIN, and the works of Hermann Brock. Great Books lists abound. . .<br /><br />...of course, one ought not to stop there . . . supplement your \\"great books\\" with the \\"missing features\\" included in Dr.Eliots' earlier five foot shelf of Harvard Classics. Eliot includes more eastern writings than Adler finally did.<br /><br />Also, do not neglect Eliot's later addition to his five foot shelf, the Shelf of fiction in twenty volumes. It is essential. I have derived much of value from goiong through this supplementary set and coming to appreciate why Eliot decided to add it to his basic famous 'five foot shelf.'<br /><br />(I would argue further with the exclusion of yet other titles from Adler's list.  Wittgensteins' 'Philosophical Investigations',  Husserl's 'Crisis of the European Sciences,'  Heidegger's 'Being and Time' and 'What is Called Thinking,'  Hegel's 'Intro to logic,'  and von Clausewitz's 'On War'( a classic of elementary logic/ game theory )  all make their way onto various great books schools' reading lists.)<br /><br />For modern verse, I wouldn't be without W Carlos Williams ' Paterson, 'Pound's 'Personae' and 'Cantos,' TS Eliot's 'Four Quartets' and 'Wasteland,' and Dylan Thomas' 'Selected' ( formerly 'Collected.' ) For practical modern philo, have Russell's 'Conquest of Happiness.' For Sci, have Schrodinger, 'What is Life?' three-essay book. For fic, dont neglect Thomas Love Peacock, no matter who else you read.<br /><br />Consider also, Philip Wieners' 'Dist of the History of Ideas, ' Benet's readers encyclopedia, Hirsh and Co's 'Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,' and the Merriam Webster Reader's Handbook' (pbk,) Toynbee's 'A Study of History' abridgement (2 vols,) and Barne's o.p. ' Cultural and Intellectual History ( 3 vols,)' if you can find it.<br /><br />Peter Watsons' idea history books, Richard Tarnas' 'Cosmos and Psyche,' may also prove useful to many. And add all the Whitehead and Borges you can stand.<br /><br />Boorstin and Arthur Koestler ( yes, AK may have been bad news, yet his books are worthy,) may serve to enrich many.<br /><br />While all this may seem an expensive proposition,  at least many of these works may be purchased on sale,  or used. Safe, sane, steady acquisition will lead you to gradual discovery of how conveniently you may gradually make room in your budget for a good personal library. Take it in stages. Public libraries can be useful,  until such time as you decide which additions you choose to actually own.<br /><br />... at any rate, any student carefully - not fanatically - lavishing several hours on each of the classic volumes included in the GBWW and Harvard Classics sets would be well-prepared, to a considerable extent, for any college curriculum.
