Crespo has made this easy in this book. He helps us to realize that our efforts are art and that art should be fun.<br />For example, Crespo's Day 1 of the second semester is an exercise encouraging artists to &quot;begin again.&quot;  He stated, &quot;Remember:  relax, love what you're doing, and don't take yourself too seriously.  Let your critics do that&quot; (p. 138).<br />I am starting through this book for the second or third time.  I don't know if I will ever be a famous artist, but now I know that I am an artist.  Crespo's exercises help me find work to do and help me to focus on principles.  Every exercise yields one or several paintings that I can display.  Right now I am doing a series of 3 paintings.  One in normal value, one in high key and one in low key.  I am having a lot of fun.<br />The exercises have really helped me improve over the years.  Anyone can learn something from this book.  But the best thing is that you can feel good about what you are doing.  You always have plenty of critics; Crespo is someone who encourages you to suspend criticism and to enjoy creativity and growth.	2002-11-16

It allowed me to put myself in another person's footprints.  Can you imagine, on your own, how it might feel when your husband gets fired and doesn't tell you the reason why?<br />Can you imagine how it might be to cope with confusing health problems without a doctor or nurse or even a family member to ask for help?<br />Can you imagine starvation for a winter without welfare?<br />I couldn't.  Yet many people in our world still cope with these types of problems.  We WANT to close our eyes to these realities, because they are uncomfortable.  They do not entertain.  But they do enlighten.<br />Julie, the main character, does manage to cope with the difficulities that arise.  Sometimes in surprising ways.  How she copes with her husband's bad temper in a time when women were not liberated may give keys to coping with less than perfect family situations.  And are there any perfect family situations?  <br />This book highlights the realities of a backward culture.  Its lessons can be extended to any backward culture.  But there is culture shock when faced with so many difficult and unhappy circumstances.  Be prepared to look into your own reaction and what is causing it.	2002-04-26

They were given some a bundle of babiche, which is stripped moosehide, and a hatchet.  Though they were aware of the tribal custom of abandonment in hard times, they did not expect it to happen to them.<br />      Accustomed to the specialization of tribal roles, the women had not fed themselves or gathered wood for many years.  They realized that they wanted to live and expressed this repeatedly with the philosophy of &quot;we will try, and if we die, we will die trying.&quot;<br />      This book is represented as an Athabascan tale.  In truth, members of this culture are very resourceful and very tough. Living in a cold, dark, stark climate, they routinely endure privation and starvation.  This tale not only highlights the will to live of this culture but extends that will to live to senior members of all cultures.<br />      As people enter senior years, they often experience the loss of loved ones.  They may also be forced to move to a new location and they may experience poverty.  As such Wallis' book functions for them as a standard of perserverence.  It is a rally cry for any of this population who are facing new challenges.  Of interest, Wallis' has selected a large font that geriatric readers can easily read.<br />      This book would also be good reading to bridge cultural gaps between younger and older generations, and ethnicity gaps of all types.  The hope and can-do attitude will work for all ages.	2001-12-04

Tucker has provided all aspects of the procedure in an easy to read, straight forward format. The book includes chapters on maternal and fetal physiology and FHT instrumentation and technology. Of particular note, are chapters on uterine activity monitoring, baseline fetal heart rate changes, and interpretation of reassuring and non reassuring FHT patterns. Interventions and obligations are discussed. A quick method for assessing FHT is given. A standard of care for FHT monitoring and care of the intrapartum and postpartum patient is also included.

It is most deeply flawed for its inability to communicate clearly to a lay person.  Essentially it is a vocabulary primer of important financial principles and concepts.  It requires abstract thinking and the ability to follow mathematical models.<br />This reader studied Cleverly's text as a requirement for a healthcare finance class.  The text was frustrating as this reader attempted to &quot;know&quot; everything about healthcare finances; however, this is probably not the intent of the book.  It does present a road into the foreign land of finances.  It demands respect for another set of data and another language for interpreting that data.  One does not master this data set at one pass, however.<br />Nevertheless, this reader did gain some new financial information.  At the risk of being simplistic, but communicative; a listing of some of the concepts learned follows:<br />1. There are many users of financial information.<br />2. Financial information can guide the formation of programs.<br />3. Financial management is essential for successful healthcare organizations.<br />4. Various qualities of health care organization types.<br />5. How health care organizations make up for discouting and bad debt and capitated payments.<br />6. General principles of accounting and why they are important.  Also that these principles still need to be explained, to be consistent, and to be clarified.<br />7. Overview of four main types of financial statements with a brief explanation of vaious line items.<br />8. That financial planning includes considering inflation before it happens, and for equipment etc. to break and wear out before it breaks or wears out.<br />9. That financial information can be better understood by comparing financial ratios of different line items and trends over time.  There are national benchmarking ratios available and Cleverly gives some and tells how to get more.<br />10. That financial planning should be an orderly process in an organization.<br />11. There are different types of costs.  Some stay the same, some are overhead types.  Some are direct, some are hidden.  Some can be controlled, some cannot.<br />12.  Figuring out prices is a very complex process in healthcare.  It is based on costs and payers.  It must also include indirect costs and costs of future problems.<br />13.  There is still stuff to learn . . .  And this reader is still no expert.<br />Finally, after this MSN course and this text, this reader is more conversant with the financial landscape.  It holds interest and it is understandable, after all.	2001-08-22

Proceding from the perception of a need to change, it directs the reader through myriads of questions and processes to be able to direct an organization through change.<br />Galpin points out repeatedly that change is a process that takes a period of time to institute.  The model of change proposed is a nine spoked wheel outlining clearly the organizational steps required to proceed through the process.  Appendix A and B are lists of questions that need to be addressed in this steps of the change process.<br />Most useful are the eight topics relevant to change. There is a chapter devoted to each topic. The topics are teams, communications, culture, leadership, goal setting, performance measurement, coaching and rewards.<br />One of the most important concepts in this book is related to the idea that change cannot occur without changing the culture of the organization.  Ten areas of organizational culture are identified.  The change agent is encouraged to analyze each area of the culture and change all possible relevant aspects of the culture in order to support the proposed change.<br />Communication is also stressed.  In order to involve all the organizational players, there needs to be communication to and from each person.  Ongoing methods of distribution of information and acquiring feedback need to be implemented.  It is not enough to passively submit to listening to feedback.  Specific feedback needs to be sought.  <br />This reviewer appreciated the pithy, pointed format of this book. Other individuals who have also read this book, told this reviewer that they think this book should be required reading for the healthcare industry.   However, the book invites further discovery in the topic of change.	2001-06-29

The personable style and ongoing case history make this a very readable presentation.<br />Marcus teaches us that conflict is not only always present and unavoidable but can be used as a catalyst for good change.  He describes differences in types of negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.  He is a proponent of interest-based negotiation which is an attempt to improve the lot of the whole by improving the parts.  He advocates active listening.  <br />As witness to his sincerity, he dedicates a chapter each to four of the healthcare stakeholders:  policymakers, healthcare management, physicians, and nurses.  Each of these chapters speaks loudest to its own stakeholder, at once representing them and persuading them to enter into negotiation.<br />Postitional bargaining is also explored.  Marcus does not advocate being a sacrificial lamb.<br />This book serves as an excellent introduction to the topic of conflict resolution and negotiation.  However, in order to engage into the fray, one would also need to continue to study and practice the principles presented.<br />Although Marcus seems preachy at times and overhopeful at others, he is at least starting to draw the diverse and strong healthcare industry into one place to sit and talk.  Hooray for that.	2001-06-25

Before I started to read I fell in love with the format and layout, the graphics and the art.  When I started to read, I was amazed at how easily I could understand the ideas that were presented. These, of course, are listed above in the main review.<br />But each idea makes perfect sense.  <br />What you will get from reading this book is a sense of assurance that a search for understanding is not only fully compatible with a life of beauty, but that it is a large part of it.<br />The suggestions for incorporating these ideas could be overwhelming, but as Gelb suggests, they should be overviewed first and done later.  This allows one to take in the book as a whole, getting an overview.<br />I see this book as being a broadening companion to the current goals of organizational learning.  It is at once a motivational tome as well as an excellent activity resource for broading systems thinking skills.<br />This is one book you can savor.	2001-05-09

I must admit that the overall work is so lush and so deep that I cannot reconstruct the interweavings, orderings, motivations etc.  But I can also say that most of the characters live for me.<br />Even though I have finished I find myself wondering how DaCapo is doing.  I wonder who Justine is introducing to Memlik.  And I wonder if Melissa's daughter is growing up and going to high school now.<br />I am grateful to Durrell for expanding my understanding of love and artistry.  I hope to read other of his works.<br />One fun thing that I was able to do with this reading was to read it with a friend.  So as I was reading one book, he was reading another.  We compared notes on what was happening with particular characters in our respective books. It added depth to the readings and gave us something fun to talk about.	2001-05-03

Of course, descriptions are lush.  One can almost hear hear the music of the closing festival and the beating of its drums.<br />Clea and Darley's relationship is embroidered over a wartime background.  Durrell uses their beautiful private island experiences to echo and foreshadow the rise and fall of this relationship.<br />And we see how Clea develops as an artist.  We are given Pursewarden's posthumous discourse on the philosophy of art.  He gives is a lot to think about.<br />Sometimes I think that Durrell is Pursewarden, and then I wonder if he is making fun of himself in the Darley character.  And in reality I find that I wish I could meet and know Durrell.<br />Clea is another must read.	2001-05-03

This is a tale of his rise to success and his parallel loss of being able to respond humanely, and his ultimate debasement. In addtion, Durrell continues to remove layers of the Alexandrian social web: Justine's motivations are different again.  I worry that they will change again in the last of the series.  Motivations for love continue to be explored.  I wish I had started a list when I started reading these books of all the different nuances of love and various motivations.  It really has made me think.<br />If you read the first two of the quartet, you cannot afford to miss this installment.  It really helps you understand the mysteries.  Of course, Durrell continues in his mastery of the language.  Descriptions continue to be lush.	2001-03-30

Reading this book is like being on well-organized, interesting rounds.  While not assuming that his audience is familiar with medical or philosophical terms, he is able to lead you from the simple to the complex.<br />His patients are presented with kindness and respect.  We wonder why patients no longer recognize their limbs or family members or even their own reflection in a mirror.  Feinberg clearly explains the areas of brain specilization whose loss contributes to these problems.<br />He then extends his discussion to problems of consciousness.  He traces philosophic discussions and current developments with simplicity and precision.  For the uninitiated, such as I, he provides a glossary which is easy to access and understand.<br />I was amazed at the extent of the bibleography and truly grateful to be able to benefit from Feinberg's scholarship. In addition, I have made notes on many of the pages which I hope to discuss further.<br />A highly recommended book!!!!!!	2001-02-19

(I had been so impressed with the watercolor decriptions of the first.)  In the beginning of the novel, I thought Durrell had decided to be more desciptive in the area of sounds and thought he had impishly personified this goal with a focus on a strange talking parrot.<br />However, I was soon drawn into the story.  I forget my efforts at intellectualizing and found that the characters had broadened for me.  I wanted to read about what was happening to them and what had happened to them.  I found myself changed from a distant observer into one who empathized with the characters.  I noticed that I had been jealous of Justine in the first novel and found myself happy that she was no longer worshipped in the second novel.<br />Durrell's desciptions went past lush and ripe into fascinating, fermenting, and magnetic.  Intrigue is introduced.  Other sides of incidents are shown.  I loved this book and intend to read the other two in the series.<br />Sometimes I get the impression that Durrell had a life time stash of pithy quotes he just had to get worked in somewhere.  In this book he has an addendum titled &quot;Consequential Data.&quot;  Don't miss these.  For example,  &quot;Gamblers and lovers always play to lose.&quot;	2001-02-03

He explains things very simply.<br />He has obviously researched many sources to be able to give his readers the pith of the advice.  There is not too much frippery to wade through.<br />In addition, there are wide margins for notes. There are references to numerous titles for background information.  Also, a nice bibliography.  Gross could update it further by putting it into APA format.  In addition, Gross could make a great appendix by listing all the books he refers to by chapter with a brief explanation of each.<br />Nevertheless, unless you already know everything there is to know about learning, you will find something or much that will be very helpful to you inside Peak Learning.	2001-01-21

The symbolism and literary devices are like plums to pick from a tree.  Lush and rich.<br />Although the plot of the story stages around Justine and Darley's love, the ideas put forth are always bringing questions to my mind.  For example, I have asked myself repeatedly, what qualities in a human cause them to be so loved by so many?  It does not necessarily seem to be strength of character, loyalty, or beauty that entrances and seduces.  What is it in Justine that is so enticing?<br />The book is stimulating and entertaining, but not on a level based on plot.<br />This ought to be required reading.	2000-11-26

There are many diverse tasks listed to enhance drawing skills.  As I complete each one I find myself saying I ought to do that again to improve.  There are assignments which I would never have considered on my own.  As such the book forces me out of my comfort level, and I am grateful for that.<br />In addition, the book offers inspiration for projects.<br />This book could be used as a curriculum guide for art projects for a high school drawing course.  I plan to be using it for many years as I improve my drawing skills.<br />It's task oriented, hands-on approach is demonstrated by the quote in the foreword: &quot;Like a language course, the success of your efforts depends upon HOW MUCH YOU PUT IN.

I tried looking them up, many of them were not in my small dictionary.  I also felt bad that I did not know many of the art names, movements, etc. that Powers gave.  I don't think I am uneducated but I really found out there is a tremendous amount I don't know.  Because of this problem the book seemed snobby to me.  And I think that will seriously limit it's readership. <br />      This book has a nice contrast in types of life problems.  There were many characters who were scarred by one thing or another in their lives; the hostage character demonstrated very well that emotional scars pale in significance to some very real horrors.  It might be time as a people to put away our preoccupations with our own emotional hurts and losses and get on with it.  This may be the message Powers is trying to project.<br />    The book explores all kinds of sensory input, and lack of input.  Imagination and various types of intelligence are visited and described.<br />    The difficulty for me was that it felt like Powers sat down with a grocery list of all the different words, art movements, types of imaginations, VR developments, etc., and crossed them off each time he got through one of them in his novel.  Some of the lush descriptions also felt like a grocery list to me.<br />    In spite of the difficulties listed above, I did like the book.  After all, I finished reading it.  (I hardly ever waste time reading all the way through an unworthy novel.)  The ending was beautiful, but it was a long time coming.	2000-10-09

Synchronicity is well described and illustrated by examples in this book.   Hopcke defines synchronistic events as being acausal, symbolic, emotional,  and transitional.  He gives not only the examples of various types of  synchronicities but goes on to explore the meaning of the  synchronicity.<br />The book can function for the reader on two levels.  <br />First, on a personal level, individuals may seek to examine their own  lives for synchonicities which will assist them in their own transitions  and personal growth.  <br />Second, on a generalized level, a reader can begin  to understand the behavior of others as related to the phenomena.   Understanding the meaning of other's life events, etc. is a very rich  source of interest.  To wit, note our practical mania for movies, TV,  books, articles, and music.  In the time of a day's work, we often find  many people constantly developing personal themes of synchronicity.  We can  be supportive as they develop their own meaning from these life events and  we can enjoy the sharing of their stories.<br />This little book is thought  provoking and interesting.	2000-09-16

It could  really cut down on inter office friction.<br />This is a book I plan to keep  in my library.	2000-08-01

It has taken much time and effort.  But it has been worth it.  The exercises recommended have powerful and liberating effects.  <br />I  appreciate Cameron's constant encouragement and nurturing.  She illuminates  the pitfalls and negative thoughts that we all fall into and gives us tools  to get away from these things.<br />One of the best ongoing exercises refers  to morning pages.  This takes much encouragement and Cameron gives it in  this book.  Doing morning pages is like proactive meditation.  But be  warned, you will need lots of paper.<br />Reading and participating with The  Artist's Way is a gift to yourself and to everyone else.	2000-07-22

I keep wondering if the author has known an individual like Dyer in his contemporary life.  Dyer's abilities of not feeling pain and healing  quickly take him through an early life of survival and success as a canny   surgeon.  <br />Dyer suffered an abrupt change and came to meet all his pains,  and indeed suffered them all at once.  The thing that I did not understand  is why this happened to him.  The life event which was supposed to have  precipitated the change is unconvincing.  There was a reference to the  supernatural in this change but I had trouble telling if the supernatural  element helped him into his feeling state or helped him cope with the  problems of his feeling state. <br />I really thought the setting of the 1700s  was well described.  The author neither glorified nor villified the age.   The description of life in a mental instutition of the time was very  interesting.  Did the author do research on this topic or did he make up  this information?  If there was research, it would be nice to see the  sources.  In any case, he presented a very believable situation.<br />This is  a book that can be discussed, because questions are raised that are not  easily answered.<br />My favorite quote refers to love:<br />&quot;It is like the  rain, brother.  You cannot always be out of it.&quot;	2000-07-12

In and through the weavings of human grief and beauty, Ondaatje also characterized the country of Sri Lanka. The discriptions of rampant political violence were frightening and  heart rending.  But I came to love Sri Lanka more than any character. It  would have been nice to have a map of Sri Lanka handy to locate the  frequent references to place names.<br />As noted by another reviewer there  are many memorable phrases.  One quote I liked was:<br />&quot;The important  thing is to be able to live in a place or a situation where you must use  your sixth sense all the time.&quot;<br />I loved Anil's Ghost, but would  recommend it only to those who love Sri Lanka, poetry, or Ondaatje.	2000-06-30

We had to buy another copy when we lost the first one.  It is an essential reader.<br />Not  unlike main character in the Emperor's New Clothes, Dave Berry helps us to  see what we pretended not to see for a long time.  And we have fun doing  it.<br />Thanks Dave.	2000-06-29

The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life.  I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever.       What kind of characters are required to make a superhuman effort?   What kind of relationships are developed by disparate humans when pitted  against great odds?  Doig helps to answer these questions.      This is a  MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest.	2000-06-13

He displays  all and shows the empty plates as well.  <br />     I felt contented and  sleepy as I finished this novel.  I had tastes and samples of loves, and I  had something in my tummy to digest for a while as well.  Something to talk  about and something to think about.<br />     One reason you should read this  book is to be able to resonate with one or more of the characters in their  love experience and finally to find and hold hope in your own heart.	2000-06-12

I got this book and I thought &quot;I don't know when I am going to read it&quot;.  But I decided to do one thing different and put it in the bathroom and have read it just a page or so at a time. I really like the  book and have recommended it to my friends.  I like that the information is  easy to read.  No small print.  Lot's of reminders for what you have  learned.  And I like that the information is fun and do-able.	2000-05-01
