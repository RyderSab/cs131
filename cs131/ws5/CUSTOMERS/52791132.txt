I liked the first two books very much, and I was afraid the end would completely ruin the whole saga. The situation was complex enough. Instead, I got another great part of the story, it kept the pace (page turner) and wrapped everything up wonderfully. <br /> <br />Do not start reading the trilogy with this book. This is a Lord of the Rings kind of trilogy: books have to be read in order to make sense. <br /> <br />I am thinking about reading the book of Revelation now to see where the author got the inspiration from. The characterization was good from start to finish, and it was not clear who was lying and who was not until the very end. <br /> <br />A great trilogy.	2005-09-08

The first part of the book is devoted to a description of one disaster after another. Very engrossing. Then comes the explanation of what is and who is God. Pretty shocking stuff. For very devout christians it might be too much. I am giving the series the benefit of doubt: I'll read the third book. The author made some very daring suggestions, and the way he wraps them up will mark the fate of the whole trilogy. <br /> <br />The book felt too short. The prologue and first chapter were included in \\"In his image\\", so it was quite a fast read. <br />	2005-08-27

The author of this book ran for Congress against Al Gore, worked for the NSA, taught political science and edited a newspaper, so he knows what he's writting about. <br /> <br />\\"What if Christ was cloned?\\" is the basic premise of the book, and intervowing it with politics and diplomacy, the author crafts a very interesting tale. This book has everything I was looking for in (and did not find in) \\"The DaVinci Code\\": a great story, believable characters, messing with Christian values in a way that some may consider blasphemy, descriptions of Christian, Hebrew and Muslim practices, and a good dose of suspense, without all the overblown hype.  <br /> <br />I consider this book to be a page-turner. I was hooked by page thirty. I'll definitely get the next two installments. It is important to consider that this is the kind of trilogy were very little is resolved by the end of book one.	2005-08-14

I would not say it is a book you can't put down, but it is a book that took me one week to read (I have a newborn who does not let me sleep, so one week is pretty fast). <br /> <br />The characters are well defined, and they grow through the book. Altough part of a series and the required lose ends for future books, this book is a self contained story. <br /> <br />I'd say it is a lighter version of the Kushiel trilogy, because both series are stories of the \\"what-if\\" kind that take place in the past, have a heroine, deal with slavery, and the magic in their worlds is subtle, not omnipresent. However, \\"Freedom's Gate\\" is not dark. There is betrayal, but is fit for young adult audiences because it does not get into too much detail. <br /> <br />I give it four stars because it is very good, but I would say it falls a little short of being excellent. I'd give it four and a half stars if possible.	2005-07-10

It is the longest audio book I have heard, and I liked it very much. The reader did an impressing job on the whole book, changing his voice to match every character. I have to say that \\"State of Fear\\" reminded me of \\"The Goal\\". Both books were written to give facts to the reader, removing the coldness from the data by adding a story.  <br /> <br />In the book, our heroes go around the globe trying to thwart an evil plan from a group of fanatics that want to profit from disaster. Almost all of the environmentalist characters in this book is either misinformed, greedy, fanatic, downright hypocrite or a combination of these traits. Environmentalist characters are caricatures, not designed to arouse any sympathy from the reader, and that is why this book gets four stars and not five. I would have liked to see an environmentalist who could withstand the righteous know-it-all agent, but the book has an agenda to adhere to. However, I did like its sobering view of the role of humanity and the environment. Also, it has some very funny segments. <br /> <br />In summary: Not the most exciting book from Crichton, but full of interesting bits of information.	2005-05-17

I read \\"Secrets of the Night Sky\\" and loved it. Then \\"Cosmic Adventure\\" was very good too, so I when I found this book I was thrilled... That is, until I read it.    Bob Berman decided he could \\"improve\\" many of the articles of Cosmic Adventure and Secrets of the Night Sky by twisting the text a little, and maybe removing a few words. Usually, when an author wants to update a book, a second or third edition is published. Instead, Bob Berman took his other two books and changed the cover, to fool people into buying the same articles again.    Below I compare the index of this book with articles in Cosmic Adventure. Some articles even have the same name:     * Look Out Below! - Unwelcome Surprises, from Cosmic Adventure.  * Physics in the Morning   * We've Got Gas - It's a gas, from Cosmic Adventure.  * The Man Who Fell to Earth  * View from a Window Seat - View from a Window Seat, from Cosmic Adventure.  * Fathoming Water - Everyday Alchemy, from Cosmic Adventure.  * The Underworld  * Odd Odds  * Measuring Madness  * Say What?  * Eat the Aliens  * Out of the Blue  * Sky Spectacles  * The Shadow Knows  * Egg-quinox  * Deadly Light  * Nature and Numbers, Rivers and Pi  * Now You See Us, Now You Don't  * Oops - Cosmic Blunders, Cosmic Adventure.  * The Discovery That Shook the World - The Most Astounding Discovery Ever, Cosmic Adventure.  * The Forbidden Light  * Our Nearest Neighbor  * Voodoo Moon   * Space Frolics - There are a couple of paragraphs coming from Strange Moon, Cosmic Wonders.  * The Big Stink  * Constellation Consternation  * Cosmic Name Calling - Naming the Universe, from Cosmic Adventure.  * BANG!!!  * Travels in Spacetime  * Light-Speed Magic  * Black Holes: Twisted Space, Frozen Time  * Going to Extremes - Going to Extremes, from Cosmic Adventure    The comparison is not comprehensive. A friend has my copy of \\"Secrets of the Night Sky\\", but topics such as the ones in Voodoo Moon and the eclipses from Sky Spectacles appear on that book.    This book was a complete let down. If this had been my first Bob's book, I might have given it four stars.    There are a few original articles, but most of the content is recicled stuff. To top it all, this book (compared to \\"Secrets...\\" and \\"Cosmic...\\") lacks illustrations, it's the shortest one of the three, and - I can't stress this enough - it is the one with less original material.	2005-03-23

This Spanish edition includes footnotes in every page explaining the archaic words. Without them, the book is not readable. I had bought another edition and could not understand many sentences. The footnotes explain places, names, and provide commentary on consistency errors that the text has.<br /><br />I decided to read the book on its 400th anniversary. I had tried before when I was fifteen, but did not get to page 100. I have finished the first book, and I'm in the process of reading the second one.<br /><br />As some have noted, some insights of Don Quijote are still modern. He talks, for instance, about the way that people that go to college are better paid than soldiers, when soldiers risk their lives and health. Also, about how entertainment is vulgar because the masses likes it that way (hence the term, from vulgo), and other subjects that remain current.<br /><br />I am going to finish the book, but it takes effort. I have been reading for two months, reading other books in between.	2005-02-27

This book is divided as chapters that begin with a narration of a battle or siege, and then and then presents the instructions on how to build several catapults. I learned my archetype of a catapult is an onagre, and that is one of the oldest kind, so I am severely obsolete. The instructions on how to build the models are very clear and easy to follow. The book is appropriate for young audiences, yet entertaining for adults too.    I built the onagre as depicted here. It can throw little wood blocks up seven feet away without touching the ground (it slides some more). In my first attempt the block would not go farther than one feet, and I realized the rope was twisting the thread in two different directions, and corrected the twisting. Tried it with different numbers and types of threads. In the end, using eight loops of candlewick, it snapped the wood where the nail penetrated. I will build a new one, using glue instead of nails, to see if it holds up better. Lots of fun!	2005-01-11

It got me hooked by the first book. This book kept me up at night reading it, and when that happens, I give it five stars. <br /> <br />The story talks about a society where females rule and males are subdued by them. Men and rival witches \\"break\\" young women before they reach maturity to strip them of their power, and mature ones slave males. <br /> <br />Then a young witch starts traveling between the realms, and those who love her try to shield her from all who want to destroy her, including a family that does not understand her. <br /> <br />Some people will find the sexual scenes too intense. If you are offended by reading sadism and bondage, then do not buy this book. I bought the first book to try it out, and one week later I was buying the next two parts. The three books make a feeble attempt to stand on their own, but they are really one book split in three: you won't get as much by reading then in disorder or getting just one of them. <br /> <br />To give you some bearings on my taste, that may be similar to yours: I liked the Kushiel trilogy (a little better than this book, in fact) for the complexity of its characters and plot; and I disliked \\"A Kiss of Shadows\\", because it had more sex than story.	2004-12-04

I bought this book to see if I could figure out how to write a story. I have not completed the story yet, but this book has helped, and I had a lot of fun reading it.  <br /> <br />Even if you are not planning to write, it explains why some stories just feel wrong (sometimes I could notice something was amiss when reading something or watching a movie, but could not explain exactly what until now) and how to prepare the reader for what is coming in the right way. <br /> <br />It increases its pace progressively, so that the last chapters are more information packed than the first. It is impressive how Card rewrites a few lines and completely changes the effect while keeping the same idea. <br /> <br />The book refers to two movies a couple of times: Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and The Princess Bride (1987). The book was initially published in 1988, so they were fairly recent. I'd recommend watching the movies before reading the book. You don't have to, but the book would have been more enjoyable for me if I had had the stories fresh. <br />	2004-11-08

The kiln people are akin to the instant clones in the movie \\"Multiplicity\\" with Michael Keaton, but instead of lasting forever, their memories are \\"inloaded\\" at the end of the day, back to the original. This revolutionalizes the world. Want to make some menial tasks? There is a specialized ditto for that. Study? Use another kind of golem. Have somebody represent you? Just pick the right blank! That's what makes the story so interesting. Brine explores implications to society, copies feelings, economics, war and defense, and more. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book. I'd stay awake late reading, yet managed to save the last four pages for the morning, when I'd be fresh for the conclusion. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2004-09-22

So I got \\"Babyhood\\" and it is ok, but not as good. Something that got in the way for me to really enjoy it may be that I have been married for a little longer than a year, so I was able to relate to many things in \\"Couplehood\\", but I have no kids yet, so a lot of the stuff in \\"Babyhood\\" is not funny, is downright scary: Pregnant wives changing cravings in minutes? Sleepless parents? Exhausted babies who do not know they have to sleep to feel better, and so they cry instead? Come on! <br /> <br />Maybe if I re-read this book in a couple of years, after going through the whole cycle, I'll appreciate it and discover that it is a really funny book.

My wife and I would say \\"Yes, this has happened to us\\". <br /> <br />We are fans of \\"Mad About You\\", and this book in some ways reflects the show. It is written as a stand-up act. It talks about situations couples face, starting a little from the dating and going through a tiny part of having a baby. It also includes a lot of general comments, not strictly related to couples. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, a relaxing book. It even helps you to say \\"they are all the same\\" when you notice how similar some situations are to your own. That can be quite therapeutic sometimes.	2004-08-25

I regularly read Science Fiction stories, and I like Asimov, Peter Hamilton, Clarke, Neal Stephenson. I really enjoyed this book. The story is engrossing, and although it deals with time travel, it is not as much Science Fiction as you would expect. It's like Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, where time travel is used, but the novel does not delve in it. Sure, it deals a little with paradoxes and a litle tiny bit of medicine, but the story talks about Henry, the involuntary time traveler, his wife, and their relationship.<br /><br />They evolve through the book, and mold each other in unsuspected ways. The suspense is great with the book, and I was always expecting more. The way they perceive each other might not be what the rest of people see, but that's a relationship, isn't it?<br /><br />It is comic sometimes, and tragic in others. It keeps having unexpected story twists, and the viewpoint from the various characters is very good.<br /><br />I took around one week to finish this one. Another page turner for me. Highly recommended.	2004-08-03

Reading the review gets you the story completely!<br />After reading some reviews and Amazon recommending this book based on my liking of the Kushiel trilogy, I was eagerly waiting to read this book. <br />I loved the Kushiel Trilogy. It has great characterization, and sex scenes (even some crude ones) that really add to the story. A Kiss of Shadows has shallow characters that are mostly interested in having sex. Again, if this book was a movie, it would be an adult film with some story in it to justify the sex, and not the saga I was expecting.	2004-06-17

The magic in this book, as in the other two, is subtle but has powerful manifestations. The book starts a little slow, yet is the darkest one of the thrilogy. It also shows the evolution of the characters, and it is easy to notice the ways in which they have grown.<br />I like how all the pieces fit. I was delighted to see how the villains have reasons for their behaviour, and there is not absolute goodness or evilry in the story, which is mostly about a woman struggling to understand the will of her gods, and help a friend in need. Phedre and her companions are a really interesting lot.<br />Very good book, with a good ending.	2004-05-13

Some time ago my wife and I were had a big fight. It left each one of us feeling as the offended party, and waiting for the other to apologize: I thought she kept complaining about everything I did, she felt I did not care about her. Really angry, I bought the book, and after reading a few pages I was able to understand her point of view. As soon as I tried to explain how she felt (not why), we got out of the cycle.<br />The book has very helpful insights. The author mentions that differences get stronger when people are in a close relationship, and almost disappear when people have been single for a while. I agree: I'd recommend the book to newlyweds after they start disagreeing about trivial stuff, but not during their honeymoon.<br />Why, then, four stars only? Because the first few chapters are much more useful than the last ones; I don't agree completely with the book; the Mars-Venus analogy gets tiresome: I'd rather read: &quot;Men do this, Women do that&quot; instead of &quot;Martians do this, Venusians do that&quot;; and finally, the author incesantly promotes his other books and products throughout the book.<br />In spite of those issues that made it a little less enjoyable, the book has really helped me improve my marriage, and I highly recommend it.	2004-05-13

What the heck! I have to comment on this book!<br />The Da Vinci Code was surrounded by so much hype I was eagerly waiting for my wife to finish reading it to start. I went to the web pages in both English and Spanish, and tried to solve the mistery. The disappointment started to creep in when I had to answer a question asking the name of the police chief according to the book... Anyway, let's talk about the book.<br />I started enjoying the book greatly. I had visited Paris and London on my honeymoon, and the book descriptions brought back welcomed memories. The book gets two stars instead of one because of this, and the fact I was able to finish it.<br />I had heard the Catholic Church was angry because of this book, and was expecting some deep research and shocking truths. Instead, I found some ludicrous propositions, such as saying that patriarchal societies started 2,000 years ago, at the same time as Christianism.<br />It also goes on explaining the golden ratio, expressing views that go against &quot;The Golden Ratio : The Story of PHI, the World's Most Astonishing Number&quot; by Mario Livio, who does an in depth (if somewhat dense) recall of the golden ratio.<br />It talks about cyphers, and for that, you could read &quot;The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography&quot; by Simon Singh, which is great, again more in depth and, unlike the Code, believable.<br />And then, the author sense of thriller is too soap-opera style for me: &quot;You know, I have a terrible secret I could tell you, but I'm not doing it now!&quot;. Please! I'd rather take my suspense from Stephen King, Michael Chrichton or Peter Hamilton any day.<br />Maybe I would have liked better the book if my expectations had not been so high. It is a teen book, without much substance.	2004-03-01

By aligning them, it is easy to see the stars that are on the sky at any day (night) and hour.<br />One side faces North and the other side faces South. It has the star coordinate system (the one in hours and degrees), so you can find planets, if you have a table that tells you where to look.<br />I think you should complement this with a book, such as &quot;40 Nights to Knowing the Sky&quot;, in order to know what you are seeing.	2003-03-18

Suddenly, monoliths commemorating the future victory of a great conqueror start appearing around the world, inflicting great damage in the spot they appear. This has profound consequences on the fabric of society, and leads to major changes in life as it has been known.<br />I found the concept behind time-travel to be solid and consistent through the book. Time-travel fits nicely into the story, and is not used just to justify the tale. I started this book a Sunday morning on a business travel, and read it completely in one day in the hotel, so engrossed I was. I found the characters enjoyable, and liked the pace of the book.<br />Since it may serve as a reference, other time-travel books I have enjoyed are: Isaac Asimov's &quot;Eternity Inc&quot;, Robert Sawyer's &quot;Flashforward&quot; and Stephen Baxter's &quot;The Time Ships&quot;.	2003-03-13

I was in college, back in 1994, when a professor came into the classroom very excited. He had a PhD in mathematics, and told us that it probably would not mean much for us, but he had just heard that Fermat's Last Theorem had been solved, after more than three centuries, and told us about a theorem and the phrase: &quot;I have a proof which this margin is too narrow to contain&quot;, and the long search for that lost proof. <br />Almost ten years later, I found this book. It's great. It's written in the same style as &quot;The Code Book&quot;, and now I understand the excitement that professor showed.<br />Going from the Greeks to the proof of the Theorem, the book provides facts and anecdotes that really make the reader care for mathematicians and their fates, as explained in it. It also mentions other related themes, like the Great Library in Alexandria, and the understanding of physics from the nineteenth century to the present. I vividly imagined how the tension in the room must have felt when the proof was presented.<br />Mathematical contents are contained in appendixes, and they include a couple of interesting problems. However, I think junior high school mathematics are required in order to solve the problems, and no mathematical background is needed at all to enjoy the book.	2003-03-13

This book is just like the PMBOK, but readable. With its 500 pages it is a lot easier to understand and study it.<br />The two sample tests included are a great preparation tool, best if taken after you consider yourself ready.<br />An important note is that this book complements the PMBOK, but does not replace it. If you are going to present the PMP exam, you are going to need to have the PMBOK too, because it covers inputs, tools and techniques and outputs of some processes that are not detailed in the Guide. However, it will be easier by far to read the PMBOK after reading the Guide.<br />I passed the test, and my only two preparation guides were the two books I mentioned here.<br />Good luck!	2003-02-09

Project Management is not easy stuff, even though many people think all they need is to get a computer package and start using it in order to be project managers (I certainly used to think so). This book is almost an index of the topics you should cover when managing a project according to the Project Management Institute, as well as a guide for the Project Management Professional Certification (PMP).<br />The book does not try to be fun; it is very technical and general. As I said before, it is almost an index: covers a lot of topics, does not get into the details of almost anything. I would have liked it to include an example of how to put all the techniques together.<br />I had to read the 1996 edition for a course, and the 2000 edition in preparation for the PMP test. The first time it was a lot more difficult to finish the book. In between, I read \\"Information Technology Project Management\\" by Katy Schwalbe, and it helped a lot. It explains the PMBOK with anecdotes and stories, as well as examples and exercises, and after getting the basics the PMBOK is a lot more readable. I highly recommend reading Shwalbe's book first.<br />And if you just want to start studying Project Management, I think &quot;Fundamentals of Project Management&quot;, by Lewis, is almost a &quot;Quick Guide&quot;, but ideal for busy people, since it is very short and easy to read.<br />I rate the book four stars because it is not exactly a page-turner. It takes determination to read it from cover to cover.	2002-09-06

Being an IT consultant, two of my main concerns are Project Management and Change Resistance. The combination of these two usually helps or dooms a project. &quot;Managing Transitions&quot; is the first book I have read that focuses on HOW to deal with change, instead of staying only in the WHAT should change, or WHY change is necessary. <br />In summary, &quot;Managing Transitions&quot; divides change into beginning, transition, and closure. It also suggests taking people's feelings into account, and giving them as much information as can be given, in order to get the trust of the ones going through change.<br />It gets four stars because in most chapters it talks about upper management as knowing exactly what has to be done, and it is only at the end that it acknowledges they may be wrong too. Since this is a book directed to managers, that is understandable. Most of its focus is in showing superiors how to lead their subordinates through change. However, it also devotes one chapter to explain how to deal with personal change.<br />With 125 pages, it is easy to read. In this \\"Who Moved my Cheese?\\" age, Bridges book is getting much less attention than it deserves.	2002-07-27

I was recommended this book as \\"a motivating book, a great read we should recommend to customers and use ourselves\\" in a company yearly meeting. So I borrowed my boss's copy out of curiosity. I read it in two days and returned it to her then.<br />The book talks about looking for signs that tell you when your \\"cheese\\" is not as good as it used to be, and be ready to look for it somewhere else, instead of getting stuck with your loss. In a word, it tells you \\"what\\" you should do. You have to define what the \\"cheese\\" is for you.<br />The problem is it doesn't tell you \\"how\\" you should do it, and that's way beyond its scope. It oversimplifies everything. And what should you do when people regret changes in a company? Tell them to read this book that compares them to mice?<br />I am convinced a better book about how to deal with change is \\"Managing Transitions\\" by William Bridges, which (even though it is not perfect) offers a framework for dealing with change, including taking people feelings and loses into account, as well as your own. But back to the cheesy book. <br />In summary, \\"Who moved my cheese?\\" is a kid's tale. It's the kind of fable you tell kids to explain why things must change. And when commenting about this with the HR head of the company I work for, he said: \\"The thing is, you have to talk to most people as if they were children\\".<br />I hope his comment is not really that accurate.	2002-07-27

Asimov is great because he combines science and stories in a perfect mix. His characters are memorable and human. His science, right. <br />The three parts of the book are really enjoyable. The second part was my favorite, set in another universe with a different kind of intelligent life. The first and the last were full of human nature.<br />This book reminded me a little about Asimov's \\"Nemesis\\", because of character development. Something I like in both these books is that there is not really an evil one: There are people, with weaknesses and strengths, and so the scenarios looks very pausible.<br />That's what makes Asimov a SF master.	2002-07-27

I think I should have read first this book and then gone to Flux, Ring and other Baxter's novels, but I started by Ring. I specially liked its first chapter, and then I discovered it was originally a short story, contained in this book. <br />I have to concur with other reviewers: I like the science in Baxter's books, even if sometimes he is too dense. The four stars come from this. Sometimes the main interest lies not on the plot, but in the ideas presented.<br />Why should you read it? Standalone, it is interesting. In the Xeelee Universe, this book gives the background to others, through its short stories. I finally understood why the Xeelee Ring is associated with a human name, and some other details about the Xeelee and other races.	2002-06-19

I was reading books like  &quot;Your erroneous zones&quot;, &quot;Too much control&quot;, &quot;Do what you are&quot; and some others like those, when I decided I wanted have a deeper understanding of psychology.<br />This book is great.

Somebody told me once: &quot;Never talk about a problem without giving a solution&quot;.

I have reread some of my old memos, and now understand why people did not like them, even if they clearly explained the situation and proposed a solution. I used not to invite people to think with me.<br />I have applied many of the topics to my every day life, specially at work, and it's given results.

I like to be open to new ideas, profane as the may be.<br />I give it only four stars because Long starts some subplots and misteries and later does not mention them again. He has a style I had found previously in Linda Nagatta's sci-fi novel \\"Vast\\", where the reader is not given all the answers.<br />I mostly liked the ending for all the irony of the characters actions, and I won't get into details it to avoid spoiling it.<br />I'd recommend this book if you are open minded, and advise catholics (as myself) to take into account since it contains a couple of things that may come hard (nuns, demons, and especially references to the shroud).	2002-02-21

This is the first Michael Crichton book I have ever read, but it is like the Jurassic Park movie: it keeps the action up all the time, especially after the first hundred pages.<br />The science sounds good, and I guess history also is, judging the bibliography found at the end of the book. It is an adventure book mixed with sci-fi and history, and very entertaining. <br />The explanation for time travel resembles the Sliders TV show or the Stephen Baxter the Timeships, but it never gets technical at all, and is one of my favorites. A really enjoyable book, which I think could be turned into a movie soon.	2002-01-11

However, I have never taken a single astronomy class, and there is a huge difference between knowing about astronomical objects and identifying them on the sky. I had seen some maps, but they were overwhelming.<br />This book changed it all. It starts with identifying one constellation, and from there it takes you to many stars. It is a very useful first step.<br />A great companion book for this one is &quot;Secrets of the Night Sky&quot;.

It depicts things with a sense of awe that arouses curiosity. <br />I bought this book because I thought it would tell me how to locate more things than a &quot;A Walk Through the Heavens&quot;, which has maps and tells you how to locate stuff by going from one constellation to the next, and from star to star, and I was a little disappointed. This book seemed at first glance too colloquial, with not enough depth. <br />I have finished it now, and the best thing this book does is to show how a sunset is amazing, that the Red Spot is not red, why the moon looks bigger sometimes, why the moon looks crimson, how some planes tried to shoot down Venus (its very fun). Also, it explains how to recognize satellites, where to look for meteor showers, how to locate Mercury, Venus, Jupiter. It has a lot of basic information, but presented in an awe inspiring way.<br />This is the best companion book for &quot;A Walk Through the Heavens&quot;. \\"A Walk\\" shows you how to locate stuff; \\"Secrets\\", why you should look for it.	2001-08-09

I work as a consultant for ERP system implementations. This book explains how many problems are inherent to Project Management, and what to do in many cases. <br />For example: Jolyon will explain how to set up estimates, and then ask questions like What if the customer thinks your estimates are too low? and propose a course of action. The book also contains many useful check lists.

I have been trying for some time to get people on my company to read about Project Management, with no success: even if they start, they don't read more than a few chapters. This book has an exceptional advantage over many other books: It is short, instructive, readable, and fun. <br />In the last three months, I have convinced four people to read this book, lending to them the copy I bought for the company, and two of them bought a copy for themselves (I almost forgot: it is also very inexpensive :-) ). Afterwards, most of them say that the book does not contain any secrets, but it provides an excellent framework on PM, and wets their appetite for this discipline.<br />By the way, some of the best books on PM I have read come from Amacom. I'd recommend Team Based Project Management, also by James Lewis, and another great book is Information Systems Project Management, by Hallows.	2001-06-29

I could not wait to know what happened to both stories (WWII and present).<br />I did not find the book to be too technical. I am a computer scientist, and I think the explanations on the book for the cryptographic issues are some of the clearest I have found anywhere, and that is in part what I really enjoyed. The other enjoyable part is the stretching of current technology to the point where you can't really tell what is real and what is an exaggeration.	2001-05-30

When I purchased this book, I half expected it to say how a Project Leader has to have personal skills and give some general suggestions about doing it. It surpassed my expectations, by being very practical.<br />I can see many of the suggestions he makes working on the company I work for. At the end of several chapters, Lewis provides some tasks you can get to work on to build your team, and keep it working. <br />Lewis writing style is great. He gives a lot of references, while keeping a good pace. He knows how to support his arguments on other authors without turning his book into an academic textbook.<br />I think a great companion book for this one would be &quot;Getting It Done: How to lead when you are not in charge&quot;, since, IMHO, &quot;Team-Based Project Management&quot; is especially useful when you have the Project Manager title.	2001-05-25

I started reading &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; last year, and I stopped a couple of times. I did not think much of the first book (there are six books, or chapters, on the Trilogy), but once I got around page 200... Gosh! I could not stop.<br />Tolkien's characters are rich, and they experience growth along the book (they also grow on you). There is a great complexity in the book, and the history that is narrated on the book (not just the story) seems real.<br />What impressed me most about the book was the pains Tolkien went through to create such a detailed and life rich world, including its past. I do not think I have read a book like this before.<br />Something that got me started on the book again was the upcoming movie Internet site. If you go to the download section, you can see the shadows of Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves and Men, and to me it was really helpful.	2000-09-27

Each chapter has insightful recommendations and comments on Project Management, and since they are independent, you may  read them in any order, getting right to the parts you are interested on.  When I bought it, I was part of a team developing a methodology for our  company, and I was looking for a good book to get ideas for this effort. I  have found this book very helpful. I had some of my coworkers read the  first chapter to get a general idea about what we should get with the  methodology, and then used some other chapters to decide what to document,  what to include on the documents, and so on. It also gave me hints on how  to manage risks in an easy way on small projects.<br />A book I think would be  a great companion to this one would be &quot;Peopleware&quot;, which  explains how projects do not fail because of hardware or software  management, but because of  incorrect people management. The two books  complement each other fairly well.	2000-05-06

This book is almost an index of the topics you should  cover when managing a project, as well as a guide to the Project Management  Institute Certification (PMP). <br />The book does not try to be fun, it is  very technical. If you want to get serious about project management, or  show off somebody who thinks he/she knows it all about project management,  this is a good start point. As I said before, this is almost an index:  covers a lot of topics, does not get into the details of almost anything. I  would have liked it to includean example of how to put all the techniques  together. Nevertheless, I would not say this books is not useful at all, I  think it is really meant to be exclusively a guide.<br />Like the other  reviewer, I read this book for a Project Management Course. <br />If you want  to learn how to manage people on projects, and you think they should love  their jobs, you should get &quot;Peopleware&quot;, by Tom de Marco and  Timothy Lister.<br />For a quick, basic introduction, I think  &quot;Fundamentals of Project Management&quot;, by Lewis, is almost a  &quot;Quick Guide&quot;, but you can give this one to busy people, since it  is very thin and fun.<br />For a book that covers human and technical  abilities on project management, try &quot;A Survival Guide for Project  Managers&quot;, by James Taylor.	2000-05-06

When everything seems like they are going to be fine, another  problem surfaces and makes them take several steps back. If you read the  previous books, you know this already.<br />Some people have been complaining  about the typos on the book, saying it is full of them. I was tempted to  cancel my order when I read there were so many typos. Well, I think the  Kiint speech is out of order (intentionally), and I found a  &quot;then&quot; instead of a &quot;them&quot; somewhere, but nothing else.  I think the book is quite enjoyable as it is.<br />And finally, I know how to  escape the beyond!	2000-03-26

I needed a book that would give the basics of this subject, without being too involved in  particular software.<br />This book does exactly that, and also lists some of  the most frequent pitfalls for projects, with half the book emphasizing the  human side of Project Management.	2000-02-13

Even though I still can not make up my mind about whether toconsider this hard sci-fi, or almost hard sci-fi, I really liked thisbook. Kress explores what would happen if people did not have to sleep, along with some political and economical consequences. A little reminiscent of the mutant hatred on the X-comics, and Gattaca (the movie). This book is easy to absorb and fun.	2000-02-13

I wanted to know the fate of the meg, and learned about sharks and depths. The drawback for the book are the characters, that are shallow and based on  stereotypes.<br />This reminds me a little of some books by Science Fiction  writer Stephen Baxter, with the good science and bad characters (Baxter's  science AND characters are better than Alten's, though).<br />I'd suggest you  read the book as I did: When I had absolutely nothing else to do (or read).  It's an average book.	2000-01-06

I am always looking for good books, and so I look for reviewed books at Amazon, and browse through the comments in order to select what to read. This one is highly recommended, so I bought, and...<br />It is great! This  dates from the 60's (past century) and is way better than the most known  dessert planet with Jedi Knights.<br />When I bought the book, I was reading  Lord of the Rings (I know what I did was heresy) but I read some ten pages  of Dune, out of curiosity... And I was hooked! I have finished books one  and two, and I am still around page 200 of Lord of the Rings, ouch!<br />In  short, I must also highly recommend this book to those who like Sci-Fi  mixed with Fantasy.	2000-01-06
