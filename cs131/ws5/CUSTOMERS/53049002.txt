I always enjoy Spenser's independence coupled with his soft heart and strong attachment to Susan Silverman.  This isn't a great novel but it does continue the tradition in a solid way and is nice easy reading.<br /><br />If you've never read a Spenser novel, I would suggest starting at the beginning with the Godwulf Manuscript and on from there for a very enjoyable -- and pleasurably long -- series of mystery novels.  The characters are worth getting to know.<br /><br />What I especially like about \\"Bad Business\\" is that Vinnie (he's a really good shooter) now has an iPod.  What a great image!  There is also a reference to Hieronymus Bosch, a Dutch painter from the 15th and 16th centuries who is also a fictitious character created by the author Michael Connelly in a wonderful series of books. Bosch, the principal protagonist, is an LAPD detective who is named after the painter. Is Robert Parker a fan of Michael Connelly?	2004-10-03

The photograghs date from the 1950s to the 1980s with most from the 1970s and 1980s.  My how airports and styles have changed.  Most of the photograghs are of people in U.S. airports but you'll also see Paris and Marseilles.  Among U.S. airports, the majority are from NYC but also Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Los Angeles among others.  One of my favorite photographs is of a business man in suit and an old style business hat speaking with obvious pleasure on a pay phone (remember pay phones?).  Winogrand also seems to favor attractive women -- whose beauty seems to transcend the fashion of the times.  The images of people standing in line are also interesting.  Some things never change.<br /><br />The reproduction quality is very good.  Highly recommended.	2004-09-11

He first started photographing in Black and White and then decided that the project required color.  Davidson generally asked permission before photographing someone  -- ironically the one notable exception was a man Davidson did not know was blind.  It is one of my favorite images (p. 54).  He offered to send them a print of the picture.  Yet most of the photographs do not appear posed.  The breadth of life on the New York subway system is impressive.  You will see beautiful women, daring and frightening young men, some violence, people dealing with crowded situations, lonely people, business people, elderly people, musicians, graffiti, people in love, street people, an arrest  -- in short the full panoply of life in NYC.  It's just wonderful.  The images are a bit on the dark side which fits the subject.  Davidson used a flash -- as this was necessary.  Many of the images have too much flash but I did not find this to be more than a modest distraction.<br />The quality of reproduction is excellent.  I learned about the variety of humanity below the ground in New York.  The enterprise was not without risk.  Someone stole one of Davidson's cameras.  The book does not make the NY subway seem to be a safe place but certainly one where it's possible to genuinely connect with the humanity we all share.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-22

Alex Webb is one of the best.  The images in this book span 25 years and focus on the U.S.-Mexico border geographically but their impact is universal.<br />Webb fills the frame with people and objects that make the viewer think and reflect about life and not just about life near the border.  You will see Elvis, leather belts for sale, restaurants, the beach, a deserted bar, children playing, an elderly man on a bus, wrestlers, a father hugging his son, checker players and a wonderful image of Tijuana taken in 1999 that includes Santa Claus, the Backstreet Boys and other well known symbols of our time arranged beautifully in one image.  This is life as it is -- not as someone wishes it would be -- and is also positive and uplifting.  Webb is at the top of his game.	2003-11-01

The book is exceptionally well written.  The author writes simply and clearly.  The text uses plain English, is free of jargon and is accessible to anyone who can read.  The book explains the importance of endings and why one should not try to rush through them.  Bridges explains about moving from the ending to to a place in between ending and beginning that he describes as the &quot;Neutral Zone&quot; a difflicult period that may seem as though it won't end but Bridges encourages readers not to rush through it and assures them that it too shall pass and lead to a new beginning.  He explains that the new beginning cannot be rushed but will happen when you are ready.<br />This is a thoughtful and very loving book.  I have returned to this book several times in the years I've owned it and each time I have found it helpful.  The publication date is unimportant as the text is timeless.	2003-10-18

It is filled with photos in black and white of children from various parts of the world who are on their last legs.  For me the most touching image is opposite a foreward from Mother Teresa.  It is a picture of an Ethiopian mother and a beautiful child waiting for food in a refugee camp.  The child is skin and bones.  The love between the mother and child goes straight to the heart.  The caption explains that the child died later that day.  In her foreward, Mother Teresa says that the \\"children in these pictures speak to us.\\"  Indeed they do.	2003-08-10

David Alan Harvey is a member of Magnum Photos and often shoots for the National Geographic.  This collection of images is superb.  Harvey does not rest on his laurels.  This is color street photography at its best -- and not many photographers are good at it.  The compositions are exciting and the colors are part of the composition.  The images cover many Spanish-speaking countries over many years and show a love for life.  The reproduction of the images is excellent -- much better than the reproduction of the images in his book on Cuba.  The lighting he captures is just wonderful.

I read the Power of Now and found it very helpful.  I expected to be impressed by this interview but it still vastly exceeded my expectations.  Tolle not only went ahead with his planned interview on September 11th but was calm and managed to say very thoughtful things on a day filled with panic for most people.  This shows the value of what he has to say.  Somehow, hearing his voice and intonations helps to understand what he is trying to convey better than words on a printed page.  I recommend this interview highly to those who find value in the &quot;Power of Now.&quot;  Very moving.  I have listened to these CDs many times.	2003-07-13

The book certainly speaks persuasively against multi-tasking and in favor of living in the moment.  The book is in line with other books that suggest that it is time to &quot;wake up and smell the roses.&quot;  Dr. Pearsall suggests that instead of occupying our minds by thinking about moving mountains we could instead -- when we come upon a mountain -- notice what a magnificient mounntain it is and sit down and enjoy it with someone we love. Why climb Mount Everest?  What is the point?  Why not simply accept its majesty?  It also talks about the importance of saying no -- even to close friends to keep from overdoing it.  This is a very thoughtful book by a very caring man and has the potential to help many &quot;over-achievers&quot; discover what is most important to them.	2002-12-25

Most of the subjects aren't famous which is a strength.  The book shows everyday scenes that could have happened anywhere.  The book also includes some famous people including:  Jacques Cousteau, John Updike, Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev.  This book is a joy and a smile. Erwitt has great vision and compassion.

It made me think more about why I make photographs.  The focus is on the art; not equipment or films.  And the black and white photographs in the book are an inspiration.  Reading the book made achieving something meaningful with photography seem within my grasp.	2001-08-11

It is about photograhy in the sense that a young woman from a suburb of Washington, DC goes off to Paris to pursue a career in photojournalism.  Kogan wants excitement and finds herself making photos of wars and meeting a variety of men.  In time she finds what is important to her and that is the most worthwhile part of her story.  The references to Leica and Nikon equipment are enjoyable and right on the mark for those who enjoy photography.  This is not grand literature but it provides insights into finding oneself and what it is like to be a novice photojournalist.	2001-02-24

If I could own only one book about photography this would it!  The images in the book are outstanding and very motivating.  This book makes me want to go out and make photograghs.  The advice is very practical (what camera to buy, what film to use etc.)  For example, the book counsels against buying another lens just because you can afford it -- make sure you need it and will use it.  More equipment does not make a better photographer.  The book features several great photographers like David Alan Harvey who recently did a wonderful feature on Cuba in the National Geographic magazine.  The book also explains how to film various subjects like people, animals, parades, monuments and landscapes.  The inside front and back covers are gray cards, which are useful.  When I travel this book is with me.  Its size makes it portable.	2001-01-15

The book begins with the vision of the photographer.  The entire first section is devoted to presenting outstanding images by great photographers and explaining why they are great.  The book does not begin as most do with the question of what camera to buy.  It places its emphasis on creating great images, which IMHO is exactly right.  The camera does not create the pictures.  The vision of the photographer does.  The book then goes on to explain the technical aspects of the craft (cameras, lenses, film etc.) in simple, clear and well written prose with good photos.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-15

The main character wants to win the fair haired maiden at any cost and in that sense is romantic.  What is lacking is any real history of the main character that would give him more life.  The ending is like a fairy tale.  The main reason I read this was to provide insight into the thinking of the author who created Spenser, who in my opinion is a wonderful character.  If I hadn't read the Spenser novels and really enjoyed them I doubt I would have read and enjoyed this novel.	2001-01-13

Galen Rowell adores the natural world and it shows.  The collection of images is the most inspiring I have ever seen.  It could only have been made by someone who spends a lot of time in the wild and loves that world.  The narratives explain the thinking behind each image, from the artistic, geographic and technical perspectives that went into making it.  For anyone interested in photograghing nature, this book is a must!	2001-01-06
US	53049002	R3GESJG1TEYTNP	081743710X	655820305	John Shaw's Landscape Photography	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An excellent introduction to nature photography	This book provides a clear step-by-step plan for getting started in nature photography.  It discusses what equipment to buy, the importance of using a tripod (with images that prove the point to those who may be skeptical), film to use, viewing and storing slides and other topics such as how to film various subjects in the natural world.  This book and Galen Rowell's Mountain Light are IMHO two phenomenal books to read if you have an interest in photographing nature.	2001-01-06

The book also speaks about the risks of so-called low risk approaches.  If one doesn't have much calculated risks are the way to go.  The book is positive and upbeat.  I read it more than 10 years ago and it is a book I turn to again and again.	2000-11-05

Red Dragon's characters are rich and the story is touching and  beleivable with two interesting love relationships that add real depth and  character.  Hannibal Lechter is interesting but a minor player.  The story  is wonderful on without Dr. Lechter.	2000-08-19

The finale is grotesque but so hard to believe that it detracted from the many wonderful pages of mystery and suspense that preceded it.  But if you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, I suspect you won't regret reading Hannibal.	2000-08-12

Block writes exceptionally well.  He does not use many more words than necessary to convey the story.  His characters are very believable.  Matthew Scudder  (the private detective and main character) is both likeable and vulnerable.  The book not only made me think about who did the awful deed but also made  me think about life.	2000-05-07

He is wise and strong.  The repartee between Spenser and Susan Silverman (the woman he loves) is a lot of fun.  Hawk does not figure in this novel but if  he had a role in every Spenser novel, Spenser would not be the independent  soul so many people have come to enjoy.	2000-04-30

Rabbi Shapiro's translation makes Ecclesiastes come to life.  It is beautiful and refreshing.  A road map for  life.  It is a book I will read again and again.	2000-04-08

The story is similar to Early Autumn which Parker wrote in 1981.  In Early Autumn Spenser is the detective and the child in trouble is Paul.  The female detective in Family Honor is almost exactly like Spenser and the  child in trouble is very much like Paul.  It was an interesting story, but  I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read Early Autumn.  If you read  Family Honor and like it then read Early Autumn.  You will love it.	2000-03-19
