It is a novel about war and the random nature of it.  The confusion and havoc of combat and its aftermath are highlighted, as can be done in any war.  What makes Doctorow's The March different is it adds to that confusion and havoc the freeing of the slaves and the very real difficulties in the \\"real\\" world for the newly freed and the newly slaveless. <br /> <br />Sherman is in the book, but he is one of a varied cast of characters portrayed, only a few of which are real.  The characters highlighted include southern belle mothers, slaves freed by the Union's march through Georgia and S.C., two confederate soldiers who constantly switch sides while one step ahead of executioners, a doctor, several soldiers from both sides - well, you get it.  Doctorow portrays the range of people affected by Sherman's march through enemy territory. <br /> <br />This novel shows the best, the worst and the \\"normal\\" people and their varied reactions to the havoc of war.  It portrays wonderfully the confusion that the future of the new south caused to both whites and blacks.  Throughout Civil War literature, this work is unique in its treatment of that time immediately after slaves were freed.  Where did they go? What were there prospects?  They did not know, nor did anyone else, and Doctorow brings this home to the reader. <br /> <br />He also shows Sherman's march through the eyes of the (primarily) women who lost their plantation homes to the devastation wrought by Sherman's armies.  The pillaging/foraging of the Union soldiers sent these formerly well-off folks into a world of homelessness to which they had to adjust - somehow - or literally perish. <br /> <br />One of the most amazing qualities of this book is that every single primary character is portrayed sympathetically.  This is true from Sherman, to the slaves, to the homeless plantation owners to the soldiers in the field on both sides.  Even the Conferederate scoundrel freed from prison a day before his execution who switches sides and roles as convenient has a loveable quality about him. <br /> <br />There is one last quality to this book that brings the hammer of reality of war down hard on the reader.  There is a complete randomness as to which characters live and and die.  There is never a clue - just as in real war.   <br /> <br />This is an historical novel in that it takes place during Sherman's march from the Atlantic into North Carolina.  However, it is not the type of historical novel that recounts the events in a \\"you are there\\" fashion with accuracy as to marches, battles and the like.  This novel is about the people who populate war zones, both combatants and civilians.  It is about their actions, reactions and interactions. <br /> <br />Lastly, a note about the writing.  I have enjoyed most of Doctorow's novels, but The March stands out as his best writing.  There are passages that cried out to be reread for their wording, their message and passion.   <br /> <br />This is a novel that will stay with the reader for a long time and should be kept for a long time.  It is worth coming back to again. <br />	2005-10-04
US	51152027	R2WC9VHPIS8173	0446500127	721554783	The Widow of the South	Books	3	10	13	N	N	Promising Start	After a very promising start in which the Battle of Franklin was described and the characters introduced, this first novel went downhill.      This is the story of how a Confederate graveyard came to be on the plantation grounds of Crofton in the Town of Franklin after the brutal battle there.  According to the historical note at the end of the book (which is very interesting) the novel is based upon the true story of \\"Miss Carrie\\", the dame of the plantation whose home is taken as a hospital for the battle and her subsequent efforts to protect the buried of bodies of the Confederate dead buried on the battlefield immediately after the bloodbath.    The initial scenes of the house as a hospital, Carrie's work and the interest taken in her by one of the wounded Arkansans is eerily similar to the plot of Bahr's \\"The Black Flower\\".  At this point the book is still good and the characters, who tell their stories in brief chapters are still interesting.    Within days of the battle and the amputation of the Arkansan's leg, the plot falls off.  There is what, I guess, could be called a love story that developes between Carrie and the soldier.  The chapters get longer as if the author was not quite sure where to take the yarn as opposed to the earlier short crisp narratives.      Once the soldier leaves there are some descriptions of his life that are totally irrelevant and add nothing to the novel.  He returns to Franklin, and there is not much to his return either.      I got the impression that the author knew the history of: a) Carrie's work in the hospital, then b) securing the bodies from the battlefield for her cemetery and last, c) running the cemetery.  However, he floundered getting from point a) to point b) so he manufactured this infatuation or love story.  It never seemed to have a point, meandered tediously and, ironically, it seemed to make the characters less sympathetic than they were before.  Carrie's husband was left out in left field throughout.  His character never to made any sense.  Two slaves who became free could have been wonderful cast members but were never developed.    The book was effective in relating the brutality of the Battle of Franklin and its aftermath.  The author was correct in his historical note that the story of Carrie, her manse and the graveyard are interesting.  However, the love story did not enhance the telling.  The Black Flower is a far better depiction of the Battle of Franklin and its hospital.  And, without a note, it apparently included a character based upon Carrie.  Bahr's \\"Year of Jubilo\\" is a better depiction of Franklin after the war.	2005-09-28

Plenty of action, plenty of mystery.  It does not matter if you know who the bad guy is - or, if you think you know - because only one man can figure it out.  You guessed it, Jack Reacher.   <br /> <br />Reacher has a quality that I loved in the earliest Ellery Queen novels.  You have all the same facts as Reacher does, yet he is able to see a clue where no one else can.  He is a tad more muscular than Queen or Sherlock Holmes, to say the least, so you also get winning fisticuffs and knife and gun fights.  He is also braver, or at least has nothing to lose, so you also get spine-tingling sequences when he puts himself at risk.  There is rarely nobility when he takes these tasks on.  He is doing what he needs to do for himself with the knowledge that no one else can or would do the task.  It never seems to matter too much to Reacher why he takes the risks he does, except that it fits into his single-minded principles. <br />  <br />Like all the other Reacher novels, this one has those familiar elements as well as Reacher's innate ability to always enlist the aid of a gorgeous woman.  Add to it very dry wit and it all adds up to a winning combination. <br /> <br />This novel had more police procedural elements than prior Child novels which made it more thoughtful than some.  On the down, or at least different, side, Reacher shows a certain cruelty in a few scenes that transcended his previous coldness. <br /> <br />Like any of these ovels, you need not read them in order.  They each stand alone well. <br /> <br />This is the usual fast-paced action mystery Child does so well.  You will be hard-pressed to put it down, especially in the last hundred pages.	2005-09-19
US	51152027	R3M6YW3FEF741Q	0399152776	340940705	Appaloosa	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Only Parker	Probably only Robert Parker could have gotten this book published.  A lesser known author could not have gotten it done.  The plot is fairly mediocre and the main character as predictable as Gary Cooper in an afternoon matinee western. <br /> <br />It is a special thing when a good author such as Parker leaves the genre in which he has written - with excellence - for years.  Robert Parker very successfully left his usual mystery genre in \\"Double Play\\" a few years ago.  He was not nearly as successful here. <br /> <br />Appaloosa is the story of two men, one the narrator, who make a living gun-fighting on the side of the law.  They hire themselves out to towns that need cleaning up.  One such town is Appaloosa, where the prototypical bad guy, Bragg, has killed the former marshall and deputy.  Virgil Cole, the hero marshall and the narrator hire on and they go after Bragg.  In the meantime, the ultimately virtuous Cole falls into what may be love with a woman of questionable virtues. <br /> <br />The two heroes and their dialogue are somewhat reminiscent of Hawk and Spenser, but they are not nearly as clever as the modern day Bostonians.  The short dialogue is stilting rather than clever and, unlike most books by Parker, most of the dialogue slows the action rather than enhancing the plot. <br /> <br />This was only mildly amusing and at times was plodding.  I would recommend virtually any other Parker book over this one.  Mr. Parker's attempt at western writing fell far short of Zane Grey.	2005-09-10

It fills in all the details - like excrement and the depressive nature of riding through 40 days and 40 nights of rain in a boat with your relatives.   <br /> <br />This is, however, more than just sitting around and telling what it might have been like on the ark - something that might be an interesting past-time for anyone.  Mr. Maine rises above this.  There is cleverness throughout - like the way Mr. Maine figured the animals were gathered and an explanation for the black race after Noah's white family propagated the world post-flood.   <br /> <br />There is also the depth of following faith - and not.  Also insight as to just how primitive - nearly prehistoric this age and its people were. <br /> <br />To accomplish all of this, Mr. Maine also gave believeable personalities to Noah's family.  First, Noah, the patriarch (and zealot)and his wife, seemingly meek but a pillar of strength.  Then each of their sons were given separate and plausible personalities as were their wives. <br /> <br />This was an interesting and thought-provoking retelling, or fleshing out, of one of the best known stories of the world.  It was enjoyable to read and I believe it is  the type of book that will stay with the reader for a long long time.	2005-09-02
US	51152027	R86VU1L51LNZ8	0446691674	578975146	A Fine Dark Line	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Shelve It Anywhere	I found this book in the mystery/thriller section.  It could have been in many other sections as well:  coming of age, southern literature, 1950's literature, dysfunctional families or race relations to name just a few. <br /> <br />The narrator, East Texan 13 year old Stanley Mitchel, Jr., gets  a lifetime's worth of education during one summer vacation in the 1950's.  While \\"investigating\\" a few murders and the ghosts of their victims, he learns about the birds and the bees, race relations (his mother is liberal his father uses the word \\"nigger\\"), murderers, friendship and dysfunctional families.  His family, though it has warts, is a close-knit support group.  Every character in the book has depth and believeability.  There are no cardboard cutouts in this novel.  Even the evil protagonists never quite fit into a stereotype. <br /> <br />The story moves at a blistering pace.  The many evolving relationships move the book along as much, if not more than, the mystery component.  There are some truly loveable characters here - main and tangential, and some truly nasty evil-doers as well.  The mystery is really the vehicle that meshes the characters' relationships. <br /> <br />Mr. Lansdale is a superb writer.  He captures the down to earth voice of the teen narrator extremely well.  There is something of Huck Finn/Tom Sawyer in both the telling and the wide-eyed view the narrator brings to the telling of the tale.   <br /> <br />This is an extremely fast-paced read, but there are so many subplots and social issues touched upon that it would be great reading group fodder.  Highly entertaining.  Highly thought-provoking.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-24
US	51152027	R19HEK3Z2CYHB	1573223026	929884077	A Long Way Down	Books	4	1	4	N	N	4 Disparate Characters	The innovative starting point for this novel is 4 people inadvertently meet on a rooftop on New year's Eve.  Each is intent on committing suicide by jumping.  Needless to say they don't.  However, the experience causes them to form an unlikely bond and they become a \\"gang\\", meeting intermittently over the next ninety days (one learns that a researcher has theorized that the urge for suicide slacks after ninety days).    The major conflict of the book is set up immediately - these are four very distinctly different people - a middle-aged woman, a former TV star, an American rocker and a foul-mouthed teenager.  The only thing they have in common is their failed attempt at suicide.      Hornby fills the book with very good dialogue.  The story is related character by character, so that there are often overlapping perspectives on the same event.  The changing perspectives keeps the book interesting.    The characters all have depth and are believeable.  Although they at first blush appear to stereotypic, as the reader gets to know them and their most intimate thoughts, they become unique. None are particularly likeable, although the middle aged woman is sympathetic.    At about the middle of the book, it slowed as the characters got a bit bogged in excessive introspection.  It must be difficult to keep a lot of motion and action when using four depressed people to tell the story.  However, Hornby then picked the pace.      Hornby also maintains a melancholy humor throughout.  Without that humor the depressed nature of the characters' lives and moods would have been too difficult to slog through, especially since the reader never gets a \\"rooting\\" interest for any of the characters.    This is an interesting look at the characters' lives and their perspectives on their own lives as well as the others'.  Also, an interesting investigation of suicide and suicidal people.  Not a happy go lucky read, but interesting and well-written.	2005-08-18
US	51152027	R3HIKKLI1Y6M1	0316734942	60378634	The Closers	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Excellent Police Procedural	I have read a few of the Harry Bosch series and found them pretty good.  This one was the best I've read. <br /> <br />Bosch comes back from a short retirement.  I am sure there is some history from a prior novel I have not read, but not knowing it did not hurt reading this one.  He joins his old partner in trying to solve old cold cases.  Due to a recent DNA hit, there is now new evidence upon which a new investigation can be started into the murder of a teenage girl. <br /> <br />The tangential characters are all good, especially the parents of the only child whose lives have been understandably altered.  Bosch is believeable in his foibles, errors and problem solving and his partner is good support. <br /> <br />Most of all, this is a terrific police procedure novel from the use of DNA, knowledge of guns, fingerprinting, interviewing, etc.  Mr. Connolly adds a nice twist with some skin head facets and some play-acting by Bosch.  A further plot twist occurs when there is a murder in the midst of the new investigation. <br /> <br />I am not a huge Bosch fan, but this novel stands on its own as a very good cop mystery.   <br /> <br />Parenthetically, the book on tape is very very well done.	2005-08-16
US	51152027	R2YEFPQVFZYEIK	1401329632	889024929	An Unpardonable Crime	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Not Dickens	Reviews of this book say it is a dark Victorian Age novel comparable to Dickens.  This is more \\"Days of Our Lives\\" than \\"Oliver Twist\\": more Harlequin than Dickens.  <br /> <br />There are a few crimes and a bit of a mystery, but they get lost in the soap opera of the narrator's life.  The narrator is a teacher who gets swept into the nefarious lives of one of the student's families.  He falls in love with two women - gets teased by one and has a night of bliss with the other (told you it was a soap).  Meanwhile the student's father is killed  - or was he?  Hundreds of pages to find out. <br /> <br />Much has also been made of the young Edgar Allan Poe's presence in this novel - it is of no note.  The character could have been any child.  His supposed biological father is involved in the mystery, but that really is of no note, either.  I could not find any reason to include Poe in the novel except to include a small historical note that Poe did spend time in England as a youth. <br /> <br />The writing is fairly good.  At times the author builds some very good suspense and conflict, only to launch another 20-30 pages not relevant to the mystery plot, but relevant to this poor sap's life as he gets manipulated by everyone. <br /> <br />The ending came crashing down into ultimate cuteness. <br /> <br />This is a good book if you are looking for a romance novel set in 1820 England.  If you are looking for a \\"Victorian novel\\" go back and reread Dickens.  If you are looking for a solid mystery as the name implies, do not look here. <br />	2005-07-28

I was very pleased about the recommendation and will continue with the rest of the series. <br /> <br />Inspector Banks is a thoroughly likeable and believeable former big city policeman who has moved on to a small town.  The character has depth as do all of the supporting cast.  All at once in this village a peeping Tom is loose (inciting the fury of the women's libbers), a murder occurs and there is a rash of robberies.  Much more on Inspector Banks' plate than the semi-retirement he had been expecting.  The big city cop to small town theme, which seems to have become common of late, is thankfully underplayed and not a real factor in the book. <br /> <br />Inspector Banks is also happily married.  This seemingly mundane though admirable quality becomes a key to several areas of conflict.  These areas are different from the run-of-the-mill cop yarn and add a unique aspect to the book. <br /> <br />Mr. Robinson does a great job weaving several threads of plot into a fast paced interesting book.  He spins the yarn by switching to and from the stories of the known good guys, known bad guys and other characters who develope into good or bad guys. <br /> <br />A very good mystery with a terrific main character.  I look forward to futute books in this series especially, if as I suspect, Inspector Banks continues to develope from one to the next.	2005-07-28

This is a terrifically researched book, but at times it got mired down in the details.  As if there weren't enough details, most pages had footnotes - some of which could or should have been included in the text, but the majority of which were so off the beaten track they did not add to the book at all. <br /> <br />That having been said, this is a very thorough look at an extremely interesting man.  Mr. Ward did a fine job in not only portraying Jack Johnson, but putting his life in the context of the times and its prejudices.  He was careful to include both praise and criticism of Johnson from both the white and black community. There was no agenda here.  It was a fair and impartial look at the man and the early twentieth century. <br /> <br />Of particular note was the portrayal of the fight between Johnson and Jeffries when Jeffries tried to bring the heavyweight title back to the white race.   <br /> <br />Johnson's flambouyancy reminds one of rock stars of today.  His abilitiy and confidence has to remind readers of Ali - who idolized Johnson. <br /> <br />A very good biography, although at times slow due to excessive detail. <br /> <br />This book could have been 50-75 pages shorter and not lost a thing.	2005-07-21

The plot got a bit bumpy.  However, the plot is an ingenious twist on the old serial killer theme. <br /> <br />Dexter, the main character, is a police employee who also happens to be a serial killer.  However, he does it for good and to fight the forces of evil....or does he?  A serial killer is knocking off prostitutes in a surgically perfect manner. Dexter has an innate ability to find serial killers, which his cop sister hopes to use to her advantage.  He admires the work of his counterpart and assists his sisters and her superiors. <br /> <br />The view from the serial killer's eyes is terrific.  The initial plot twists just looks too predictable to be true.  Thankfully, it is too predictable to be true and the turn and the twist that occurs works well. <br /> <br />This is a goos mystery and, if like me, you have tired of the serial killer routine, this is a very welcome break. <br /> <br />A fun read.	2005-07-12

The main character is an activist/active female.  The story line is terrific with twists and turns.  The setting -East Texas Depression Era is interesting.  Race relations of the times are explored as well as the place of women.  There is terrific dialogue with humor thrown in.  A bit of pathos...everything works. <br /> <br />The book starts with a flaming red-headed beauty (thus her name \\"Sunset\\") blowing her husband's brains out when he is trying to rape her after severely beating her.  Not only is she not convicted, she becomes the redneck town's constable. <br /> <br />Sunset is one of the more compelling main characters I have read in quite a while.  Her supporting cast is wonderful.  Sometimes -though rarely - they may be a bit too good to be true on the outside, later it is shown they each have enough warts to be believeable.  Mr. Lansdale rarely allows a character to remain as he or she appears to be in their introduction.  Almost every character changes making the plot move and stay constantly fresh. <br /> <br />Added to these wonderful features is a fairly decent mystery plot, which of course gets twisted and turned by both the characters and the author. <br /> <br />This is a rare book.  Not only was it fun and entertaining - great southern humor and expressions - so it is suitable for the beach; but it has depth warranting thought and consideration.   <br /> <br />Now for the sexist stuff:  I highly recommend this to both men and women.  My daughter loved it.  She loved the story, the humor and the heroine.  Yet, it is in no way a chick book.  I loved it for all the same reasons.   <br /> <br />This really should be a bestseller.	2005-07-12

What I got was a well-written, though occasionally verbose, romantic biography of Zorro up to the age of 20. <br /> <br />Ms Allende tracks the hero's life from birth through his boyhood, through his years in Barcelona and then his return to California.   <br /> <br />From a historical background view, there is a lot here.  The author captures the times well and her descriptions of the times and settings are very good.  There are clear 21st century views here, especially in the portrayal of Indians and their plight, women and the Spanish Inquisition.  The viewpoints are not overwhelming, it is just a politically correct view of the early 19th century. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there is so much other \\"stuff\\" in the book that the characters get lost.  It is almost unfathomable that in a biography of Zorro the reader hardly gets invested in the main character.  There is a curious detachment in the telling.  It is almost as if the narrator only observes the actions of our hero from afar (even though we learn late in the book that the narrator is a close confidante).  Zorro and Bernardo are cardboard cutouts and their actions and thoughts are extremely predictable. <br /> <br />The book is told in the third person, although the narrator occasionally interjects in the first person.  Those interjections were usually incongruous and were somewhat feeble attempts at humor. <br /> <br />The swashbuckling scenes one would expect were rare and short.  Although well-written, they were so brief they failed to build any excitement.  I found myself interjecting memories of movies and TV Zorro to imagine the scenes because the author did not put enough description into her action scenes.  That is a shame because she is clearly adept at description. <br /> <br />All in all this was a romance historical fiction more than an adventure book.  If that is what one is looking for, this fills the bill.  If you are lookingfor action-packed exciting scenes, you will have to go back to the movies for that Zorro.	2005-06-20

There are the dark shadows of Sweden's fall - snowfall and snow showers are prevalent.  There is also the dark shadow of Naziism, both past and present, that begins with a haunting prologue. <br /> <br />This is a police procedural mystery that touches the characters' pasts as well as present.  The main character is compelling.  No superhero, his cancer diagnosis is constantly with him and, normally enough, depressing him (the side plot of his relationship with his girlfriend lends honesty and emotion to the book).  He oversteps his bounds to be part of the investigation, which is not in his territory, and oversteps the bounds of proper procedure when to do so is too tempting to resist. <br /> <br />When the first murder occurs, the reader is confidant of knowing the motive.  After the investigation is under way, the murderer is introduced.  A second murder, however, throws all the reader's assumptions about the first murder out the window.  It also throws the police for a loop.  The twists and turns in the plot continue to the very end and not one is predictable. <br /> <br />The three main characters and the first murder victim are all fleshed out nicely.  None are cardboard cutouts.  Each is unique and has depth.   <br /> <br />This was my first Mankell book.  I will certainly look for others.	2005-06-14

It should be \\"The Last Days of Grant with a Little Twain Thrown In\\". <br /> <br />The vast majority of the book is devoted to Grant's life.  There is some background biography, but really starts with his near bankruptcy and then his efforts to get his memoirs written - a truly compelling story.   <br /> <br />There are a few short chapters devoted to Twain.  Unfortunately, there was a disappointingly small  amount of space devoted to the friendship between Twain and Grant.  It obviously was addressed, but never in depth.  It appeared that the two men were living parallel lives rather than experiencing a close friendship.  This was the major short-coming of the book and where it did not live up to its billing. <br /> <br />It is well-written, however.  The account of Grant's struggles to complete the memoirs and what it meant to him was very well done.  The accounts of Twain were equally good.  The author just never really brought the two great men together in any meaningful way.  Regardless of that shortfall, it is still worth the read for the account of the memoirs writing.	2005-06-08

The reader learns much about the Pacific Northwest, large trees, logging, the Haida and other tribes, and weather and sea conditions surrounding the Charlotte Island, BC.   <br /> <br />The subtitle, however, is \\"A true Story of Myth, Madness, and Greed\\".  There is much on the greed of lumber companies and loggers.  There is little about the myth and not very much about the \\"madman\\" who cut down the golden spruce.  By the end I was tired of the tree primer.  There is actually more devoted to explaining photosynthesis than there is about the Haida's myth about the golden spruce. <br /> <br />The basic story is of a mutant ancient spruce that is golden rather than green.  It is on the Charlotte Islands, home of the Haidaa.  The tree is cut down by a logger who apparently has gone off the deep end and fells the tree as a protest.  The story line gets lost in all the many digressions and other information.  At the outset, the information was interesting, since it was captivating background.  Unfortunately, very little was presented beyond background information.  The book is terrifically researched on all the other grounds.  I got the feeling when I was done that there just was not a lot to the main theme of the book.  It was mostly filler/background to fill pages since the chief theme could not fill more than 50-60 pages. <br /> <br />The writing is good and there is a lot of information about a little known part of North America.  Just don't come to this book thinking that it will be primarily about a myth and madness.	2005-06-08

Everything Mr. Cruz Smith has written since is downhill. <br /> <br />This starts well with an apparent suicide that our reluctant hero, Arkady, is not sure was a suicide.  His superiors do not want it investigated, but a business associate of the \\"New Russian\\" businessman/millionaire does.  Later, a second death of an associate puts Arkady on a case he is sure is connected to the suicide. <br /> <br />After the promising start, the best word to describe the book is choppy.  Suddenly, Arkady is in Kiev with whole new cast of characters.  Not very smooth backtracking is used to bring the reader current.  Even in Chernobyl, the story jumps around from character and place to character and place, never smoothly bringing everything together.  The ending is a further disappointment, since this inpenetrable mystery is cleaned up in about four pages by a confession followed by an incongruous shooting. <br /> <br />There is a redeeming virtue, however.  The setting of post-disaster Chernobyl is compelling.  The author conveys the hopelessness of the people who stayed in the \\"Zone\\" because it was there home and those who stay there to work in a chillingly apt manner.  The tone of his portrayal brings home these feelings of inevitable slow death by radiation as well as his words do.  The description of the place, times and people there made up for the plot's inadequacies. <br /> <br />All in all a mediocre effort, although the haunting Chernobyl setting and people will long stay with the reader.	2005-06-02

Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there. <br /> <br />Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable. <br /> <br />The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles. <br /> <br />There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title \\"Rope Eater\\".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain. <br /> <br />Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever. <br /> <br />This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing. <br /> <br />As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment. <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

Mr. Block imbues him with clever turns of phrase and wordplay throughout the novel. <br /> <br />The plot is better than the last few \\"Burglars\\".  It is filled with instances of what Bernie aptly calls \\"the long arm of coincidences\\", but they all work.  Heck, if you can not suspend reality for a brief time while reading a book about a burglar who is solving all the crimes of NYC, then you shouldn't have your nose in this book anyway. <br /> <br />The plots has many interesting twists and turns.  What separates this from the run of the mill mystery is that Bernie, as a burglar, manufactures some of the best twists and turns.  Some you see, some you don't.  In addition to the primary plot line, there are a few subplots, or side mysteries, that get pulled together at the end.  The forces of good overcome several forces of evil - even if the laws of breaking and entering are put to the side. <br /> <br />The characters are all well-developed - especially Bernie.  His repartee is always good, especially with his lesbian friend.  Their conversations is where the wordplay is the finest.  They are a couple of believeably clever and witty people with whom it would be a pleasure to spend time. <br /> <br />This is a good mystery that you will read with a smile on your face.  Highly recommended as a clever and amusing romp.	2005-05-26

Coben gets the reader enthralled immediately.<br /><br />This is a mystery with several intertwined mysteries going at once and several characters proceeding in several directions, yet also all entwined - a delicious mix, especially when stirred with good writing.  At times, Coben came perilously close to overdoing it, but he never passed over the razor thin line between head-scratching and hair-pulling.  The plot worked and did not get over the top.<br /><br />We have the ex-con, who really isn't a con, a county inspector, the FBI, and an Amazon private detective, all in the hunt (with a few helpers to boot) for what first appears to be a murder, then two murders connected, then a third.  All get tied together in the end.  At about page fifty, the reader is afraid he has at least some of it solved.  Fear not.  Nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a great mystery with twists and turns taken by a few different threads.<br /><br />What adds to this book is Coben's characters.  They all have depth, a rarity in a genre where one is happy if the main character has some depth.  There is not a single cardboard cutout character.  They all have feelings, flaws and strengths.  This book actually has three characters you want to root for, yet they are not perfect, nor even close to it.  For that reason, there are times you really have to doubt them - which just adds to the mystery.  The primary bad guys are not all bad.  Their motivations are understandable, which makes them human.<br /><br />This is a page turner and great mystery.  Highly recommended, I think this is Coben's best and certainly much better than his last.	2005-05-20

Mr. Perez-Reverte's mysteries are intellectual and fascinating.  This book is neither.  Nor is it a thriller, despite the thrilling nature of the first ten pages.  It is an account of a woman who starts as the girlfriend of a pilot for a drug ring, moves to be girlfriend of a drug-runner who uses a boat and then, after prison, builds her own fortune in the drug trade thus becoming the Queen of the South.    The boats and planes must have gone fast, but boy, this novel did not.  Maybe it was the translator (who changed from P-R's first works), but I doubt it.  As much as the writing was slow, so was the plot.      The layout of the book is in two intermingling parts.  The author of the Queen's biography interviews characters associated with the Queen.  Then it bounces back into a direct account of the Queen's life as related by that tangential character.      The Queen never became a sympathetic character.  The reader never could understand her motivation, wants or desires.  She was not likeable; nor was she unlikeable.  She was just \\"there\\".  That was also her view of her own life.  Too many pages were devoted to recounting her inability to expalin why she was doing what she was doing.  There was no attempt at explaining her motivations.  It is difficult to travel through 434 pages with someone that provokes absolutely no feelings.    The plot, as noted, is thin.  She goes from girlfriend to girlfriend/runner, to prisoner to mogul of an enterprise.  The mogul part comes at the speed of light.  The small bit of tension in the novel is in the first twenty or so pages and then the last 30 or so.  The rest is slow and blah.    Mr. Perez-Reverte should return to the mystery genre.  Fans of his should avoid this book.	2005-05-18

ALthough many of the elements are the same, this does not work. <br /> <br />If I could put stars on portions, I would give five stars to the first 150 pages and the last hundred.  Unfortunately, I would put one star on 300 pages in between. <br /> <br />The good parts are an interesting town in Turkey, with terrific idiosyncratic characters, some good writing, some witty writing, airy tone when appropriate and very good decriptions and accounts of brutal and savage sights and instances. <br /> <br />On the other side was interminable redundant vignettes that did not move the story nor enhance the account.  There are also terribly confusing and impossible to follow historical chapters on Mustafa Kemal Attaturk and the wasrs of the Ottoman Empire and Turkey from the turn of the century to the 1920's.  Even after going back and trying to put these events into some logical sequence, it was impossible to track them as written.  There was so much detail, that the point of Turkish independence was all but lost. <br /> <br />All those negative attributes are in the middle pages.  It got so awful, I nearly quit.  I am glad I read the last hundred pages.  They redeemed the promise of the first portion.   <br /> <br />The book is told by the actors - some major players, others bit parts.  In the beginning, you get to know the villagers well and watch them carry on their lives oblivious to the on-coming World War.   <br /> <br />Once the war begins, the author flips into this whole other mode of trying to justify Turkish atrocities by recounting atrocities committed by its allies and enemies.  He tries, in fast-paced short chapters to explain the military and political maneuverings of one of the most complex eras of this century in the most complex area of the world.  It does not work. <br /> <br />After the war is over, the uthor takes us back to the village and the villagers we met earlier and recounts the effects of the war and the mass deportation of Ottoman/Turkish Greeks and import of Muslim Greeks in their place.  Again, the story and characters ring true as in the first part. <br /> <br />The characters will stay with me, as will the difficulty in plowing through the middle.  I can't say I recommend this book, although it does have the redeemable virtues of the of the first third and last fifth.	2005-05-11

When I saw that Crais had written another Elvis Cole novel I looked forward to the following:  good writing, good plot, interesting foes for Elvis, cool Pike and Elvis' humor.  Forgotten Man has all of the first three, little of the fourth and none of the last.  No funky clocks in the office, no witty wisecracks, no humor.  Elvis is still in a funk over Lucy moving back to Baton Rouge.  If you have not read at least the last book in the series, this entire relationship will mean nothing to you, although he explains what happened.  For avid Elvis readers, her haunting presence works. <br /> <br />Old characters return, including Sharkey - the bomb squad cop who got blown up in another prior Crais work.  Her history is not so important. <br /> <br />Beyond Elvis' change in personality, this book works as a good mystery/thriller.  A dying man's last words that he is Elvis' father (who Elvis never knew) starts the action and the tension.  Crais is a master at good twists and turns and including the bad guy's perspective through the book.  In this case, the reader is not sure who the bad guy is or why he is a bad guy until near the end of the book.  His lurking presence builds the tension. <br /> <br />This is a good mystery/thriller.  The only disappointing aspect to Crais fans is that Elvis is no longer a humorous character, but rather a depressed one.  Even without the humor this is recommended.  Craid is a master in this genre. <br /> <br />	2005-05-03
US	51152027	R2JF3L10XFLBD5	1573222984	401018820	The Portrait	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Rant	This is a short novel, which is a good thing.  I do not think the author could keep the pace and intensity of the monologue going for much longer.    The tension starts immediately as the painter/narrator begins his rant against a critic with whom he has a long history.  It is obvious he has a grudge against the critic, even as he recounts how he idolized the critic who educated him to the finer points of art and life.    The tension continues unabating through the pages.  One aspect that must be considered is if the critic is really there.  Why would he voluntarily submit to the rant?  Could the artist have gone completely off the deep end and be talking to himself?  There is a haunting aspect to his diatribe.    So many questions.  This is the type of book that will be assigned to fiction classes and disected for years.  It is also a book that will stick with the reader.  This artist is intense, enraged, caustic and wants revenge.  His version of revenge is interesting.  The intensity is such that the book keeps moving although most of it is devoted to a retrospective of the lives of the artist and critic.    There is a terrific twist at the end that adds to the book.    One caution.  If you are, like me, not very knowledgeable about art, there are parts that will be missed.  I am sure art historians and officianados will enjoy the book even more.	2005-05-02

The plot looks to take a great turn as the killers are revealed to be part of a Ukrainian mob with an Afghani connection.  What had so much promise withered. <br /> <br />There is everything you expect from Parker and these classic characters - good dialogue and witty repartee in particular.  Unfortunately, that could not overcome the thinness of what should have been an excellent plot.  Hawk shot.  Revenge.  Tony Marcus' territory of books and prostitutes being infringed.  A questionable alliance with Marcus.  More questionable alliances with other crime types and traslators - it's all there, but comes up way short. <br /> <br />There is instant resolution with very little sleuthing.  Little tension is produced although the odds look to be precipitously against the good guys.  The ending was so stereotypic as to be maddening.  So what went wrong? <br /> <br />As in Sudden Mischief, Parker spends WAY too much time analyzing the relationships of Susan and Spenser and Hawk and his girlfriend.  He then goes on to analyze Hawk and Spenser on their own.  Too much therapy couch, too little mystery and action.   <br /> <br />So why three stars?  Parker still does great dialogue.  He is almost singular in his ability to move a plot by dialogue.  This is also a nice fast relaxing read - beach reading type.  So if you've got a few hours to kill and don't want anything too taxing, this will fit the bill.  It certainly is not up to Parker's usual good fare, however.	2005-04-29

It is a mystery that truly gives some history of the era in which it is set. <br /> <br />The mystery plot is one with twists and turns and backs and forths that would be a tribute to any mystery novel.  The hero, Weaver, is a Jew in 1719 London who begins to investigate the possible murder of his long estranged father.  From there the mystery unfolds into the nascent financial markets of London and the first stocks and bank notes.  The historical note explains that this was the year before the first stock \\"market\\" crash in an English speaking country.   <br /> <br />Weaver, a former pugilist and \\"thief-catcher\\" does not know the world of finance, which is a convenient vehicle for Mr. Liss to explain the financial market of early 18th centruy London, including the frauds, the hype and the real investments.  He is led through a maze of intrigue in which the Bank of England and the South Sea Company are always competing and always possible suspects in the murders - among others.  As the search for the answers continue, Weaver is constantly being aided and deterred (often physically) by different contingents. <br /> <br />Beyond the mystery, Mr. Liss enlightens the reader on the early stock market, paper bank notes, London society and European attitudes towards Jews and their attitudes towards England. <br /> <br />Adding to the flavor, and fairly amazingly, Mr. Liss writes the novel in the tone and cadence of 18th century novels.  The reading truly rings true. <br /> <br />The book takes a while to really hit its stride, otherwise it would have been five stars.  Past half-way, however, it gets difficult to put down.  The suspects continue to change in Weaver's mind as well the reader's.  I was confident of at least one obvious answer to the mysteries, only to be very pleasantly surprised when I was proven wrong and the obvious answer was not used. <br /> <br />Highly recommended as very strong and entertaining historical fiction and mystery.	2005-04-28

By far the most interesting part of this book was the exploration of computers' potential - for evil as well as good. <br /> <br />The main characters are generally on the wrong side of the law - a devoted hacker and manipulator of computer programs and a housebreaker are only fairly engaging.  Due to the secretiveness required by their illicit lifestyles, they do not have much depth.  Of course, this time they are on the side of truth, justice and the American way.  There is a supporting cast member, John, who starts the mystery ball rolling and saves the day in the end who is more interesting. <br /> <br />Once you get beyond the computer stuff in this book - which is very impressive, the plot and the characters are a bit flat.  The plot line is the star hacker of the world is killed and his laptop taken.  The rest of the book is the pursuit of the laptop...on foot, in car, in plane at times, but always by computer.  If one is into computer, this will be a great book. <br />Again, beyond the computers the plot is a bit flat and contrived at times. <br /> <br />Recommended for the interesting computer sleuthing and hacking - for that part it is clearly a five star book.  The failure to make the character and plot line more interesting, brings it to a good to very good book.  Well worth reading.	2005-04-24

It was an appropriate metaphor for the entire book. <br /> <br />This is a loss of innocence/come of age novel narrated by 19 year old Wils Ravan during his last summer before college.  First, a strike at his father's company, then the debutante ball season and then a love affair ending with the death of his girlfriend's father move the plot along. <br /> <br />Frequently, Wils is described and he describes himself as an \\"old 19\\".  This is certainly for sure.  Despite his innocence in life, his thoughts, observations and philosophizing are well beyond his years.  At times, these musings rang hollow due to the incongruity of the innocence superimposed on the philosophical narrative. <br /> <br />The characters never get fleshed out.  Even in Wils, we just get to skate the service of the character.  I came away wishing I knew more about him, his father and Aurora (his love interest) and even Wils.  For such a deep thinker, the narrator never learned or told much about the important people in his life. <br /> <br />There were dichotomies through the book.  For instance, Wils points out that since he is working for a tabloid during the day and attending balls at night he is seersucker by day, tux at night guy.  This interesting contradication was explored too briefly, but well in a short passage.  Again, this is an example of \\"skating\\" on the service.  It was an interesting conflict, but not gotten into deeply by the author.   <br /> <br />At times the writing is wonderful.  At other times a bit cuimbersome.  The lack of quotation marks made dialogue frustratingly difficult to follow. <br /> <br />Perhaps the best feature of the book is its portrayal of the fifties - a time long long ago in so many ways.  Mr. Just shows in many small ways how much the world has changed since then.	2005-04-19

If, as I, you are lukewarm towards the author, you will see it as very good but less than great.  Although there is nothing to love during the reading, the main character will stick with you for a long time as will the theme. <br /> <br />This is 288 pages of the thoughts of an extremely self-aware and analytical neurosurgeon during one Saturday - a day off.   <br /> <br />He has a wonderful life.  He would be the first to acknowledge it.  His cold scientific view of the world is belied by his love for his wife and two children - all wonderful and successful.  The tone of the book would make one expect the children to be thorns in the father's life or the marriage to be less than ideal.  However, the family is a wonderful one.  There are no professional or financial worries.  However, the tension begins immediately. <br /> <br />The tension is from the outside world.  It starts at 4 a.m. when he observes a plane on fire from his bedroom window (he awoke in a great mood) and suspects another post - 9/11 terrorist act.  He then tries to go through his usual relaxing routine, only to be butting against the outside world at every step.  A minor auto accident becomes another catalyst to undermine the Utopia that should be his.  The other driver appears in a violent scene at the cocktail hour when the family is celebrating the artistic achievement of the daughter. <br /> <br />Dr. Henry Perowne is constantly at odds with the world.  His perfect life is countered by the violence of the world of terrorists and more personally by the other driver.  His very scientific view of the world is challenged by his artistically talented and successful children.  His rage in the final scenes is supplanted by his need to heal. <br /> <br />What appears to be a dark and depressing view of life turns out to be a fairly romantically optimistic view. <br /> <br />There are some tryingly tedious parts in this novel.  They are worth plowing through.  They actually add to the flavor being concocted by Mr. McEwan.  There is suffering even in the best of lives.   <br /> <br />Although I do not love McEwan and find him difficult to push through, I found this to be one of his better works and worth the push, especially the last fifth of the novel. <br /> <br />No beach reading, but worth the effort.	2005-04-17

After a start that was a bit slow, it turned out to be a warm mystery that was all about friendship. <br /> <br />In 1997, the Union Train Station in Kansas City is about to be demolished.  When the police sweep the building to clear it, a man named Birdie is found.  Birdie has lived in the station for 63 years.  He was a former inmate of Somerset Asylum who escaped in 1933 and \\"moved in\\" to the Station.  During his short tenure at the asylum, he is befriended by Josh who helped him escape.  The book then flashes between 1933 (occasionally before as well for background) and 1997 to get the story.  The policeman who found Birdie is intrigued and does some follow-up sleuthing. <br /> <br />About half-way through Mr. Lehrer's work, the reader is convinced that he has figured out a rather simplistic plot.  That is not the case at all.  There are some clever twists and turns that include the bloody massacre at the station in 1933 (that was part of Hoover's and the FBI's push to notoriety). <br /> <br />The plot line is very good.  Although this really could not be classified as a mystery, there is some sleuthing and unexpected plot twists. <br /> <br />Primarily this is a book on friendship and loyalty placed in interesting settings and told through interesting characters. <br /> <br />I have enjoyed a few of Mr. Lehrer's books (Black Widow and Special Prisoner) and thought others not very good (No Certain Rest).  This is by far his best.  A warm book.  Highly recommended. <br />	2005-04-11
US	51152027	R3NQYTL8ZFHGEW	0399151885	102390096	Double Play	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Not Your Typical Parker	Robert Parker's books are almost always mysteries set in modern day Boston.  This is not a mystery and it is set in 1940's New York.  It has what Parker always does well - strong tough guy main character, shadowy criminals, and good dialogue, but the book is about far more than the good tough guy beating the bad guys - although that does happen in a terrific and clever way. <br /> <br />Burke - this novel's tough guy - is a wounded WWII veteran who returns to find his wife has left him.  He moves from one underworld enforcer type job to another and then to being a bodyguard to a spoiled daughter of a mob boss.  From there he is hired to protect Jackie Robinson.  He is the \\"nothing left to lose\\" stoic. <br /> <br />The plot follows Burke protecting Robinson during his first year in the major leagues.  There are lessons to be taught and learned by both while the mob is after both Burke and Robinson. <br /> <br />It is always a slippery slope to incorporate a real person in a piece of fiction.  However, Parker pulls it off well.  There is nothing about Robinson that is unbelievable.  A fictitious character might have been used, but it would not have given the novel the legitimacy that using the real Jackie does. <br /> <br />Interspersed through the book are very brief autobiographical sketches by Parker as a boy, baseball fan, Jackie fan and pubuscent adolescent.  They add another feather in the cap of credibility to the fiction.  The real box scores add more credibility. <br /> <br />There are lessons on love, friendship and race relations.  However, the book never gets preachy or sanctimonious. This is because the characters learn through experience rather than lectures.  This is the true talent and trademark of Parker: the story - and here the lessons - are moved along by action. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-11

I did not pay enough attention to the blurbs on the cover of the book when they cited \\"changes in genre\\" so I was ill-prepared when the book launched into science fiction.   <br /> <br />As is well-known, this novel consists of six very loosely tied story lines.  The middle third is science fiction.  One can deduce that the two story lines take place after a nuclear holocaust.  One is not too bad, but the other is almost unreadable due to the first person narrator's syntax/dialect. <br />For someone like me, who is not a science fiction fan, this third (or more) of the book was trying. <br /> <br />The other story lines are anywhere from tedious to mediocre to good.  One set in the nineteenth century told by an American in New Zealand and aboard a ship was okay until its tedious second portion.  Another consisting of letters by a self-absorbed bisexual \\"artiste\\" moocher got tedious quickly.  Another about a publisher was amusing and interesting.  The last, a thriller-type about a twentieth century reporter (presaging the nuclear holocaust) was good throughout. <br /> <br />As you can see, there are very varied genres and voices in the different plots.  They are so disparate that they do not come together or enhance each other.  There was a tendency in all to be over-written. <br /> <br />The lasting impression I got from pushing myself through this book is that it seemed to be the result of a college creative writing course.  During the semester, the same assignment was given six times: write a story set in ____ with ___________ as a theme.  Once the six assignments were done, they were put together into one \\"novel\\". <br /> <br />In sum, if this were six separate novellas, I would have enjoyed only two.  I would not have enjoyed either enough to strongly recommend it. <br /> <br />This was a critically acclaimed book.  So is Moby Dick, but it has never been a best-seller. This is a book written to be admired and discussed, not to be enjoyed. <br />	2005-04-08

At times, the voice is of a wide-eyed innocent boy of nine or ten years old.  Then, in the next paragraph, the adult voice is ranting about Immanuel Kant or his proofs of God.  The child was likeable, the philosopher not so attractive. <br /> <br />The parts describing the author's youth in Cuba were very good, as were the small recollections of being an \\"orphan\\" in Florida.  I found the philosophizing and constant attempts to find deep meaning in memories of childhood burdensome and at times contrived. <br /> <br />The author clearly had an unbelievably interesting life.  He faced the purgatory of losing a country, a life and his father, as well as a good part of his youth. I think the memoir would have been much better had the author told that tale in a more straight-forward manner.  His rantings may have been cathartic for him, but they do not serve the reader well. <br /> <br />All that having been said, his childhood will haunt the coldest reader.  The portrayal of Castro's takeover of Cuba's every day life was compellingly told through the eyes of the youthful boy.  One realizes how the losses of the small things in life can be as devastating as larger losses in freedom or economic terms. The story of a boy's losses at the hands of Castro is one that will be remembered for a long time.	2005-04-04

Well-written, lots of action, the obligatory gorgeous woman, etc.  There is not much to differentiate the plot from other Bonds.  That is not to say it is not a classic in the spy genre - all of Fleming's are.  This is just not the best. <br /> <br />What does differentiate this novel from the others is the bad guy.  He is right up there with the best of the bad.  Mr. Big is an ingenious torturer/killer.  He wants to be the first great black criminal and commit his crimes with ingenuity and subtlety.  He is great character.  One of the most sinister villains a reader will ever encounter.  The plot line actually plays second fiddle to this master of voodoo and evil. <br /> <br />A warning, or maybe a cultural aside:  this book, written in the fifties, has a none too politically correct view and take on the black race.  Especially at the beginning, it read as a cross between revolting bigotry and an interesting lesson of the racial stereotypes of the fifties. <br /> <br />A good, solid spy novel with everything one can expect from Fleming's Bond.	2005-03-27

Started by the Roosevelt administration it was Hoover's launching pad for the FBI. <br /> <br />Mr. Burrough's research was exhaustive - the book was bursting with facts in text and footnotes.  Aided by recently declassified FBI files, Mr. Bourrough was able to piece together the short but notable careers of Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, the Barkers and their gangs.  Other sources included first hand accounts and those of relatives and survivors.  Due to the opening of the files, the author was able to debunk some of the myths that have developed in books and movies.  He was also able to identify and debunk the mythology that was spawned by Hoover's imagination and his PR machine.  The bumbling of the early g-men was amazing when placed next to their more recent images as paragons of images of efficiency.  Some of their failures were outright humorous.  <br /> <br />Adding to the book, is that Burrough's accounts of the robberies and manhunts were written to be as exciting as fiction. <br /> <br />The only criticisms of this book is that at times it dipped into minutae.  It is so dense and fact-filled, I wished I had kept a scorecard from the outset.  Also, the book is arranged chronically, so it would switch from gang to gang even if one was in the middle of a long kidnapping scheme.  At times this broke the continuity, making the reader have to go back to review what a particular gang was doing. <br /> <br />That is a minor criticism when weighed against the fascinating stories so painstakingly researched and well told. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-03-24

Bond is not a fleshed out character and Mr. Fleming seems almost to be feeling out what he wants to make him.  Regardless, it is a very good spy novel.  Having read later Bond novels, a few old friends appear, giving it that homey feel. <br /> <br />There is what will become the mandatory formula: a beautiful woman, the coolness under fire, chase scene, entrapment and escape that make these novels all work so well.  Fleming's writing is superior to most in this genre. <br /> <br />There is a great sequence of events surrounding and involving a big-time game of baccarat.  Having read prior reviews, I went to my Hoyle's before starting so I would knoe the rules.  That is not necessary.  The game is simple and Bond conveniently explains it to his beautiful cohort.  The game is probably the highlight to the book. <br /> <br />A very good stepping off to a great series.  An excellent light read. <br /> <br />	2005-03-24

Having underestimated the American gangsters - as M said he would - he gets into and out of a heap of trouble.  In this novel he uses more of his physical than mental attributes. <br /> <br />This is a fun read.  Almost a screenplay for a movie, by gosh!  It does not have the tension and suspense of others, such as From Russia With love, but it has plenty of action instead. <br /> <br />Fleming is a terrific writer who can turn a phrase and describe a scene as well as anyone in this genre. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for a light romp.	2005-03-11

Frequently I had to stop just to admire the wordsmithing I had just encountered.  Mr. Vanderhaeghe has an unparelleled ability to use metaphors, similes and simple words to describe something so vividly that you think you are looking at the object rather than a page in abook. <br /> <br />The story line is a young, idealistic Englishman gets lost in America.  At the urging of their tyrannical father his two brothers search Montana and into Canada for him.  Along the way they are joined by a Civil War veteran and a woman who are key players and a few ancillary characters.  There are interactions with Indians throughout, but not of the cowboy and Indian type.  <br /> <br />The tale is spun by the characters themselves, flashing from one to another.  Occasionally a third person narrative is interjected to move the plot along.  The author gets the different voices of the characters well so it is easy to maintain the identity of the speaker.   <br /> <br />The historical context and relations with the Indians of the area are captured well.  There is a love triangle and a character or two going over the edge.  Sibling rivalries and love are explored deeply. <br /> <br />In addition to the fine writing, the author is terrific at developing the characters.  Early on, the reader feels that he knows all of them, which always adds to a book.  The dialogue between them is colorful and believeable.  Often in a book such as this the first person narratives do not work because the author embues the speaker with too much knowledge or intelligence to be believable.  Mr. Vanderhaege does not fall into the trap.  The thoughts of each are credible and fit their personalities. <br /> <br />My only criticism of the book is that there are a few slow spots that are long enough to detract from the story line and the book as a whole.  Even in the areas that are not so well paced, however, the writing continues to be absolutely wonderful.  If there were half stars this would be be four and one half. <br /> <br />This is strongly recommended for the writing first, the characters second and the story line third.	2005-03-09

Cod was interesting, readable and entertaining as well as being a comprehensive history of an interesting and little known topic.  I thought Salt would be the same.  Perhaps the best way to sum up the difference between the successful Cod and the tedious Salt is to note that Cod was 294 pages and Salt, 449. <br /> <br />Salt is tedious and redundant.  There is no central theme.  The author takes us all around the world, salt lick by brine spring to relate how every salt producer produced the salt and then distributed used or distributed it.  There were plenty of trees, but Mr. Kurlansky never found the forest.  Every chapter was merely a new stop on the tour.  The tour was so disorganized that it did not proceed geographically nor by time. <br /> <br />A few hundred pages shorter and this would have been so much better.  A few examples of salt production types and an overview would have improived it to be readable and interesting. <br /> <br />There are some pearls such as the Chinese were producing salt with the aid of natural gas while Europeans were virtually still in caves.  The Egyptian mummification was also interesting.  Unfortunately, these were in the first chapters.   <br /> <br />Interestingly, Mr. Kurlansky's history virtually ignores the twentieth century.  Very little is included about the 20th and 21st centuries except a few excerpts of salt producing areas that went under and the noting that Morton and Cargill are now the two largest producers.  Virtually nothing was included about how they got that way or how salt use and production compares today with 100-200 years ago. <br /> <br />This is a very tough read.  I would not recommend it after the first 80-100 pages.  With those read, unfortunately, you've got the book.	2005-02-28

Mr. Ellis' biography is primarily analysis rather than a year by year account of Washington's life.  Due to its interpretive nature it reads more like an extended college lecture than a straight biography (that is a good thing). <br /> <br />Mr. Ellis takes each major event in Washington's life, gives background and then investigates the motivating factors giving rise to Washington's actions and the great man's motives or thinking.  Ellis' analysis is based primarily upon Washington's and others' correspondence. <br /> <br />The author's presentation is very smooth.  His interpretations are also extremely objective.  He avoids the myth-making while avoiding equally fault-finding for the sake of magnifying imperfections.  The insights into Washington's thinking and motivations are excellent.  The Washington presented by Mr. Ellis is by no means perfect.  However, through his interpretation of the general and president's life, one can see how Washington was seen as perfect by so many. <br /> <br />This is a terrific addition to anyone's Washington or Revolutionary era library.  Mr. Ellis did a fine job tackiling a subject so often done before.  The biography is a fresh look at Washington.	2005-02-23

Then I thought it to be a yarn promoting wonderful journalism (Lupica's main career).  However, soon into the book, I realized that this was a darn good mystery/thriller.  Coben's jacket blurb was not an empty compliment. <br /> <br />There is the hazing component and the journalist hero, but the digging by the journalist and the student reporter who idealizes him is captivating. <br /> <br />The setting is a rich Long Island town that is enraptured by its basketball team.  This year, though, it is even more centered around its team than usual.  A ghetto star of NBA caliber has joined the hometown's star player to produce a team ESPN is aching to televise.  When the team manager ends up dead, the drama begins.  The high school reporter gets wind that the death has something to do with the team and he enlists the big time journalist who has quit and returned to his hometown. <br /> <br />The journalist begins to suspect hazing, even though there is no real evidence to support the suspicion (a weakness of the book which led to the thought early that this book would preach). <br /> <br />The young and the old begin to unravel the mystery as they are threatened and more players on the team are hurt or threatened as well. <br /> <br />This is a well-told tale.  The plot twists and turns and the good guys are ot always right, which always adds to their credibility.  This was a highly enjoyable book that avoided sermonizing and just told the gruesome tale.	2005-02-18

Akunin shows another side to his talent in this mystery.  A Winter Queen had the added aspect of giving us 19th century Russia.  Leviathan takes place on a luxury liner owned by British and French interests and has an international cast.  The novel is reminiscent of Agatha Christie in tone and flavor but is still unique. <br /> <br />Erast Fandorin, the star young policeman of A Winter Quenn arrives in this book as a suspect - one of several suspects identified by a French commissionaire who is investigating a grizzly mass murder that occurred in Paris.  As the book goes on, the commissionaire makes repeated gafts (in a low key humorous way) and Fandorin, who is assumed to be a diplomat and never identified as a policeman, corrects him.   <br /> <br />Like a good Christie, there are lots of twists and turns and when things looked to be solved another event or murder sets the search off again. <br /> <br />The characters are rich and unique, from the self-congratulatory commissionaire, to the meekly overbearing pregnant woman to the humble and understated Fandorin.   <br /> <br />There is little doubt why Akurin is a best-selling author in Europe.  I look forward to his next American release and expect that he will soon have a strong American following - he is certainly worthy of one. <br />	2005-02-14
US	51152027	R1OU1CC2BGY84	0375508589	62929266	Shadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Non-Fiction Mystery	The story line is simple.  A ship wreck is found in deep water off the New Jersey coast.  It is quickly identified as a U-Boat, but no U-Boat was ever reported as sunk in those waters.  The hunt then begins to identify it.  Dive after dive comes up empty as does research attempt after research attempt on land in archives, libraries, museums and interviews with WWII particiapants. <br /> <br />This account of finding and identifying a shipwreck has all the elements of a good mystery novel.  The author gives an education in scuba, historical context of German U-Boats, biographies of characters who progress, regress and stay stalwart throughout, historical sleuthing, sleuthing while diving and a real mystery solved.  In sum, this book engrosses as each of these elements are brought together well by the author. <br /> <br />Mr. Kurson obviously did his homework and it helps.  For the reader not familiar with deep sea and shipwreck diving in the 1990's he gives a very good overview so the dangers can be understood.  Those dangers become apparent when three divers die diving on this wrecked U-Boat trying to identify it.  Even the reader must begin to wonder if the ghosts of the dead sailors are protecting their secret. <br /> <br />Out of the water, the two heroes, who could not stand each other at the outset, work together in NJ (in and out of the water), Washington and Germany to try and solve the mystery of the identification of the U-Boat.  They ultimately find that history had been revised for ease of bureaucrats cuasing them to hit dead end after dead end.  Once they think they have identified the sub (the third theory at least), they still want to find tangible evidence from the wreck to verify the research's answer. <br /> <br />The author captivatingly tells this yarn of the sleuthing on ground and in water.  He relates how the attempt - which took many years - affected the participants.  Mr. Kurson manages to tell the story with enthusiasm while still maintaining objectivity. <br /> <br />This is a great read for anyone interested in diving, WWII history, or just an outright good mystery.  It would have been a good novel .  The fact that it is true and so well told makes it a very, very good non-fiction book.	2005-02-10

Do not be alarmed, Forsythe does not trade on 9/11.  However, he tracks a Serbian underworld figure and ties him in with 1991 terrorists. <br /> <br />Forsythe crafts the novel out of a series of chapters jumping from one character's biography to the present to another biography and back to the unfolding yarn.  As he goes, you begin to see the intertwining relationships as they gather.  Eventually they build to an exciting and very clever climax. <br /> <br />The characters are terrific.  There are the black and white bad guys and good guys and one extremely thought-provoking character who takes the ends justifies the means tact.  One is left wondering at the end which is better - the really really good guy or the guy who looks at the end, then the means.  It is that conundrum that separates the Avenger from a mere thriller. <br /> <br />As all of Forsythe's books, it is well-written and researched.  Well worth the read.  Also, if you listen to the unabridged book on cassette, the reader is terrific.	2005-02-07

Ideals are good. <br /> <br />It is, on the surface, the story of a boy who dreams of growing up to be a big-leaguer and makes it.  To add far more poignancy, he is a Red Sox fan way up north in Vermont on the Canadian border.  Bastard son of a country singer who runs an \\"escort service\\" on the side, he frequestly talks to the staute on the village green of his forebear, Ethan Allen.  A drifter comes in to town and begins to give him tips on baseball.  Eventually he learns the drifter is his father.  The revelation is not sappy, nor is their on-going relationship. <br /> <br />More than the baseball are the idealistic messages of dreaming is okay, but if you dream, you must work like heck to make the dreams comes true. <br /> <br />There is also humor throughout.  The boy's mother is a priceless mine of one-line Red Sox related insults.  The mother is the dream mother for a boy growing up - a playmate as well as his home school teacher.  Her methods of earning money are as entertaining as her mother's one-liners.  The locals are all portrayed with a loving humorous brush by an author who obviously relishes small towns and their unique denizens. <br /> <br />As a sidenote, the baseball instruction is very good and true.  There is one minor rule error, but other than that, the author truly knows the nuances of the game. <br /> <br />This book will be loved by anyone who loves baseball.  It will be at least well-liked by anyone who enjoys small town stories with a considerable amount of humor.  One warning is that through the first quarter or so, this seemed to be a teen's book.  As it goes on, it becomes much more.  That having been said, this is also agreat book for teens on up.  It can be shared by parents and children.	2005-02-07
US	51152027	R37EX1IO3BS4NP	0385503490	730501801	The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony that Shaped America	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Solid History	This is a good solid history of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands, now known as New York.  Mr. Shorto relates that there has been little reported on this history because of America's Anglophilic history and a lack of documentary history.  Several years ago volumes of documents were found and they are now being translated in the archives of the NY State Library.  It is this recently unearthed and translated documentation that enabled Mr. Shorto to write this book. <br /> <br />The history is interesting and Mr. Shorto does well with what he has.  Unfortunately, there are gaps, presumably attributable to the dearth of documents.  For instance, the author goes on for pages and chapters about how Van der Donck is working so hard to get a representative government into Manhattan.  He is then completely thwarted by the Dutch government.  A few pages later, the history recommences a few years thereafter and there is a representative government although Van der Donck is still held in disregard by the powers that be. <br /> <br />Other than the unavoidable gaps, another criticism is that Mr. Shorto redundantly posits that New York/Netherlands was the first place in the colonies and the globe to be truly tolerant.  He contrasts this equally constantly with the English colonies in Massachusetts and Virginia that were founded as intolerant theocracies.  Having related this throughout the book, he then devoted most of his conclusionary chapter to reiterating it. <br /> <br />Although Mr. Shorto does well relating the Dutch-English alliance and then rivalry, he does give a bit of a short shrift to their intense rivalry in the East Indies, perhaps giving an inordinate amount of credit to New Netherlands for their wars. <br /> <br />All that criticism aside, it should be stressed that this is a good and interesting history about a very little known aspect of American history.  Mr. Shorto does bring into focus that NY was truly the original melting pot and its tolerance carried(s)through hundreds of years after its founding.  The author's love for his subject certainly came through. This is worth the time.	2005-02-01

Proving that Boston is just a small town, several characters from Spenser's world appear, most notably Dr. Susan Silverman.  You do not need to be a Spenser fan, however.  If you are one, the familiar characters lends the warmth of old friends to this mystery. <br /> <br />Sunny Randall is an attractive blond thirty-something private eye hired by a snot of a girl to find her real parents - even though her parents says she wasn't adopted.  At the same time, Randall is going through personal issues that lead her to consult Silverman in a professional capacity.  Parker teases his old fans by never revealing anything about Silverman's life (except she owns a dog), despite coming tantalizingly close a few times. <br /> <br />The mystery is a good one, with twists and turns.  It is apparent who the bad \\"guys\\" are early on; but just as Sunny knows who they are, there is a small thing known as proof to be found. <br /> <br />There is a warmth to this book not common in the PI genre.  Sunny has family and friends in support/assistance roles that makes it seem truer to life than if she was a stand-alone do-it-all PI. <br /> <br />Like all of Parker's books, this moves along on dialogue, which is always realistic and good.  The novel moves as fast as conversation. <br /> <br />This is a fun entertaining read.  Highly recommended.  It will not make you a better person except for the enjoyment it brings. <br /> <br />	2005-01-26

Not his latest entries.   <br /> <br />Once again former Detective Corey, now with the Anti-Terrorist Task Force gets to tell a story with no decent ending.  It seemed Mr. DeMille was paid by the word, for in 485 pages, very very little actually happens.  Of course you get Corey's constant complaining and paranoia with humorous barbs thrown in, but there is very little detecting or plot here. <br /> <br />The book is centered around the crash of TWA 800 off Long Island in 1996.  Corey's wife hooks him into investigating it - more particularly, trying to substantiate the eyewitness accounts that said it was shot down by a missile. <br /> <br />Of course his old nemesis, Ted Nash and an FBI agent want him to stop his unauthorized investigation, but he marches on. <br /> <br />Here's the crux - he's searching for clues and a videotape of the incident five years later - 2001.  By the time you are half-way through, the reader realizes that DeMille has brought us to September of 2001 when there was a verifiable terrorist attack.  It is just a question of how he will tie 9/11 into his novel. <br /> <br />The ending is extremely disappointing.  It showed he really did not know where he was going with the negiglible plot. <br /> <br />The writing is good and there are the usual patches of humor.  It is a very readable book and at times entertaining.  There was just so much redundancy in the investigation and Corey's paranoid kvetching/complaining.  If you enjoy DeMille's style, as I do, it is an ok read.  If you are looking for the fine complex plot lines he used to do so well, do not look here.	2005-01-25

It fits the mold well, with nothing to distinguish it from her other Plum novels. <br /> <br />Plum is after an elderly bail jumper and can't get the geezer, which leaves to some humorous action and some fairly funny lines from Stephanie's grandmother.  There is a what appears to be a side plot with a couple of druggie high school chums that is also amusing - mostly due to the druggies.  As always there is the bountiful sexual innuendo - and at times more.  She's engaged but still haunted by her commando bounty-hunter colleague.  Lula is her usual self, which leads to laughs.  Stephanie's sister tries her hand at lesbianism, there's a lost heart - literally, etc.   <br /> <br />You get it - the light-hearted fun escapades from Ms Evanovich and her main character, Stephanie Plum.  I would suggest reading at least one of the earlier novels in this line, just to have a handle on the characters.  Also, if you listen on tape, the actress reading has a terribly grating voice and accent.  Reading it is the way to go - on a beach, a plane or a bus where you do not need extreme powers of conversation. <br /> <br />	2005-01-21

Obviously a genius, he never is able to corral his personality and later his drinking to stay in one place/one job.  He lives off his dishonesty from his completely fabricated resume to his cars that are never paid for but always improving in style and cost. <br /> <br />As Geoffrey grows, we watch him begin to assimilate some of his father's habits and tendencies.  Amazingly, he does this in the face of his father's constant teachings not to lie and to always be true to self. <br /> <br />Eventually Geoffrey grows and, after a stint in England and then a semester at Princeton, he begins to see his father as he really is and draw distance from him.  After one last year living together, his father pulls one more financial coup that enables Geoff to get his life back on track.  Geoff then abandons his father (not without cause).   <br /> <br />There is no sweet ending like a novel but, rather, a bittersweet one. <br /> <br />The book often read like a novel due to the elder Mr. Wolff's highjinx.  At times a comedy, at times a tragedy.   <br /> <br />Mr. Wolff is a good writer whose stark style fits this memoir perfectly.  This is an entertaining and poignant book, well worth the time.	2005-01-21

He would look at disdain those who took the magnifying glass to the scene, The Big Four is completely different - he is right in the front line of a series of mysteries, in each of which the Big Four criminals have had their hand. <br /> <br />There is much invention here - special gases, special poisons, etc.  Almost like a Bond action yarn.  I could not tell if Ms Christie was spoofing this genre or stepping out into it on her own. <br /> <br />The book is set up almost as a series of short stories where there are separate crimes.  Each time, Poirot figures out that they are perpetrated by the Big Four masterminds who want to take over the world.  He identifies three pretty quickly.  It is the fourth that has him stymied.  A lot does not make sense in the novel - such as why didn't the syndicate take HP out when it looked as if he was getting close?  Also, there is very little explanation of how HP solved each crime and even less at the climactic last scene. <br /> <br />Making the book enjoyable, and contributiong to my thought that this may have been a spoof, was a bit more humor than usual for Christie.  Most of the time it was tongue-in-cheek and self-effacing or directed at HP. <br /> <br />This was not a bad book, but certainly not up to Christie's usual standards.	2005-01-19

This one follows the negative suit. Don't read it if you are looking for giggles. <br /> <br />The narrator is an old radical now in her fifties.  She returns to Liberia where she spent several years after being a rather small time operative in the Weathermen radical underground.  She tells her story of leaving America one step in front of the FBI and fleeing to Liberia where she marries, has children and is in the epicenter of revolutions and coups.  She (the pronoun is easiest to use because she uses three names during her story) is brutally honest about herself and her relationships.  This is about her only endearing quality.  Other than that minimal quality, she is not a likeable character at all.   <br /> <br />Truly self-centered, she constantly puts herself on a pedestal as a big-time radical, someone important to Liberian revolutionaries, attractive to diplomats, etc.  As the yarn unwinds, the reader begins to realize that she is not the big-time actor she thinks.  At times this realisation seems to touch her surface, but she quickly submerges it.  Her rants about her mother may be most telling.  Her own self-analyses at times gets tedious, however. <br /> <br />Along the way there is some great insight into the Liberian revolutions/coups/civil wars and the corruption of puppet governments.  I found these aspects of the book - the historical notes and insights to be the exceptional.  There is also an ironical twist at the end of the book that is very satisfying. <br /> <br />Although I found the book to drag a bit in the middle, it progressively got better and the last fifth or so was by far the best.  Again, this is not beach reading, but a well-written look at radicalism in its forms from the somewhat delusional American form to the concrete killing in the streets radicalism of twentieth centruy Africa.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-14

In the tradition of Ambrose's D-Day and Skyboys, and other recent WWII accounts, Mr. Hornfischer has not only researched the historical documents, but interviewed (or read interviews) of many of the participants.  It gives the extra personal account when a sailor gives his account of his personal experience and sights and sounds.  Hornfischer includes hundreds, or thousands of such accounts. <br /> <br />The only short-coming of the book was that there were so many accounts of personal experiences that the larger picture often became obscured. After reading eight or ten accounts from the sailor of one boat, a reader would has to take pause and resurrect the battle in his mind when the accounts suddenly move to another vessel. <br /> <br />All in all a good and detailed account of the last surface to surface naval battle in history.  Mr. Hornfischer aptly points out that this is the last such battle and he, as an obvious lover of ships, somewhat grudgingly gives credit to the aircraft that saved the ships.  A conclusory analysis of the relative efectiveness of the planes to the ships would have been a bonus here. <br /> <br />A good read for any WWII or naval buff.  Another feather in the cap of the WWII participants.	2005-01-08

It was a slow start to an excellent expose of people's true characters and motivations. <br /> <br />As one can tell by the prologue, a man is shot by his 12 year old daughter.  What the prologue does not tell you is who these people are or why he was shot.  Mr. Bohjalian then spends a bit too long \\"introducing\\" the characters - a brother and sister, their mother, daughters and spouses.  After the episode with the gun, the novel really picks up and grabs the reader. <br /> <br />The conflicts are endless among the characters who are related.  The author then brings in lawyers and animal rights activists who all have their agendas and want to superimpose them on the family that is quickly crumbling under the stress of the accidental (or was it) shooting. <br /> <br />There is no romance or chivalry in Mr. Bohjalian's characters.  He strips them to their basest personalities.  They therefore are not likeable, but they are thoroughly understandable.  The characters as portrayed are probably the most realistic possible - do we really have nobililty and romance in our lives?  Do we really have those assets when tragedy hits?  We would like to think we do, but this novel hits home as the characters act, think and say what we would all probably be thinking in their place, even if we do not go through with our thoughts.  For example, if you are left crippled by a stupid mistake of your brother-in-law, wouldn't you rather not speak to him than forgive and forget?   <br /> <br />The characters are very realistically portrayed.  Their emotions are brutally displayed.  The only character a reader can root for is the ten year old cousin, Willow.  Her innocence and lack of alterior motives makes her likeable and gives the view we would like to see.  The other characters display those qualities we all have but would like to keep hidden. <br /> <br />Bohjalian is similar to Wolf in his portrayal of less than sympathetic characters, but somehow, for me, he does it better.  A reader does not come to hate any of the characters (although the man shot is an annoyingly fanatic animal rights guy) because they all ring to too true to ourselves.  They do nothing hateful, only what we would do if left to our own selves in difficult situations. <br /> <br />Along with the character portrayals, the author brings to the table such issues, as gun control, hunting and animal rights.  Since both sides of every issue are presented there appears to be no agenda by the author. <br /> <br />The writing is superb.  After the shooting, when all the conflicts hit, the book really captures the reader and moves much better. <br /> <br />A very good read.  A very good portrayal of realistic characters.	2005-01-03

In Fluke, Christopher makes a comeback with a very funny book that is also a very good book.   <br /> <br />In Lamb and Fluke, Moore's outlandish humor takes a backseat to the quality of the novel (I thought Sequined was written for the whackiness rather than any plot).  He has two main heros and a few sidekicks who are all terrific characters - each with their own quirks (of course) and qualities.  In each is a major component of reality which actually makes them believeable.  They may be extreme, but everyone has met at least one person like each of them - though usually not all in one setting. <br /> <br />The setting here is the whale research community in Hawaii.  Mr. Moore includes interesting (true) information about whales in the telling of a story that at different times reads as an adventure novel, a mystery, a sci-fi fantasy, a conservationist tome and an evolution debate.  Obviously there is much more in this novel than just whackiness and humor. <br /> <br />Humor is still also a significant part of the book.  If you can't laugh at the white Rastaferean from New Jersey, there may not be a character in literature at whom you can laugh. <br /> <br />This is a fun read that is also worthwhile for the information it provides and is also thought-provoking on a few levels - evolution and conservation among them.  Read it, enjoy it and laugh at an extremely funny book that has redeeming value beyond the guffaws.	2004-12-29

Perhaps if I had developed a relationship with Sir John and the other characters I would have found more in this book.   <br /> <br />The plot, as a mystery, is only fair.  The resolution of the plot is slghtly less than fair.  The historical setting is good, but the reader does learn enough new things about the period to make it exceptional.  London in the 18th century certainly has a lot to offer.  The most unique part of this book is its descriptions of the nascent racing industry in England which was interesting. <br /> <br />The narrator character is somewhere between a budding genius and a naive waif.  Maybe that is an honest interpretation of one's self when one is younger.  I found his tone/manner annoying - it sounded as if he was narrating a PBS special.  What surprised me (not for good or for bad) was that Sir John Fielding - the lead of the series - was a secondary figure. <br /> <br />The book did move well, however, and the characters were likeable.  The dialogue was good and often had a trace of humor. <br /> <br />Based upon some of the reviews that said this is the worst of the series, I may pick up another.  Without that peroration, however, I doubt I would.  This was not a bad book, just mediocre.  I wanted to like it more due to the setting and the early likeability of the characters.	2004-12-28

The author throws in some histories of summer homes, Cape Cod, \\"old\\" money, \\"old\\" Boston families, some family pyschology and history.  All are tied to the Big House - a vacation home on Cape Cod in his family for a century. <br /> <br />The writing is very good.  At times, when Mr. Colt is describing a particularly fond memory or a feature of the house he waxes poetic. <br /> <br />Mr. Colt weaves his family's history in and out of this house well.  Along the way, he describes so many events and objects that, to the reader, it becomes more than just his family history.  It is a history that has elements that will touch every reader.  Perhaps your family did not enter tennis tournaments; but maybe they sailed, or walked beaches or swam or had a summer place.  Every reader will find reminiscences that will resonate. <br /> <br />The only short-coming I found to the book was a too-long description of the machinations the family underwent to sell the house.  The remainder flowed well. <br /> <br />The memoir uses Mr. Colt's last summer at the Big House with his young family as a catalyst.  He knows the house has been sold and that this would be his last summer there.  This led to the most poignant moments when he and his family would do something special or, something very ordinary, that had been done by three generations before and Mr. Colt would realize it would be the last time - gathering crabs, walking the beach, playing on the tennis court, etc. <br /> <br />A very good book that brings family, a slice of the twentieth century and a bit of history through the nineteen rooms and yard of a big old vacation home on the Cape. <br />	2004-12-22

Her telling switches back and forth from the events of 1992 when she started dating her husband to the summer of 2002 and back to 1996 when he struck her at least once and she was beaten.  She testified against Nate, her husband, and he landed in jail.  She landed amongst dark memories in his ancestral home where the assault happened.  <br /> <br />In 2002, she is brain-injured and appears to have plateaued to a point where she can function.  She then learns that another man in prison has confessed to the crime of beating her and her recollections come into question.  She tries to face mountains of trancripts and seas of memories to be sure she was right six years before.  As she does so she becomes more and more unhinged. <br /> <br />Mr. Jaskunis keeps the tension flowing consistently.  Maggie is so haunted and depressed, a reader will want to walk - no run - away from her the same way she keeps wanting to run away from her life.  However, Mr. Jaskunis skillfully keeps the reader engrossed. <br /> <br />The story is well-told.  The author switches back and forth between the underlying relationship and events and the present well.  Every new day brings more recollections/recountings that weigh down the narrator. <br /> <br />The characters are deep and well-portrayed.  Obviously, there is sympathy for the victim start to finish.  However, at the end, one must also feel sympathy for the husband, even though he was unlikeable almost from the first - even before the reader knew he was the one Maggie knew had so brutally assaulted her.  The portrayal of Maggie's angst is compellingly told.  Her elderly neighbor and a reporter are both integral parts of the supporting cast and portrayed equally well. <br /> <br />This is no lightread.  Rather it is an intense story of someone suffering a closed head injury and the horror of what she thought was an assault by her husband and then trying to reconcile the truth, that it was not him after both their lives have been ruined. Recommended if you don't mind being depressed by a terrifically written book.	2004-12-17

In the first seven, Reacher is the strongest, toughest, smartest action hero.  The books were fun and exciting, but did not require much thought to get through the plots. <br /> <br />In The Enemy, Child has changed gears.  The book is set when Reacher was a young major in the military police (age 29) in 1989-90.  This is a pure police procedure mystery set in the military which is a setting obviously well-known to Child.  In this book, Reacher solves the mystery with brains and legwork.  There is only one true action scene and that is minimal to the book. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book more than Child's others.  It had more substance and thought.  Reacher was treated as a developing personality rather than the automaton he seems to approach in the other books in the series. <br /> <br />This military police mystery is highly recommended both to Reacher fans and fans of mysteries in general.  As a sidenote, you do not have to have read the other books in the Reacher series, since this one predates the others in the character's life.  Enjoy a good read.	2004-12-02

Spenser follows and questions, and meets, greets and questions some more, but there is never any tension and virtually no conflict.  The wife-swapping characters are barely introduced so you really don't care about them in any fashion.  The substance of the book is the dialogue, which is good, but not good enough to carry a novel. <br /> <br />This is pure low to middle of the road Spenser fare.  A quick read that is probably worth passing up to look for a more inspired earlier effort of Mr. parker. <br />	2004-11-29

However, he does not have any homosexual sexual experience until he answers a personal ad.  The first year recounted by him (1983) is filled with his first date/sex and his obsession with sex.  He cannot go to a dinner party without checking out the \\"equipment\\" of every male there.  Sexually he was like a horny 14 year old.  It got old pretty  fast and would have even if written in a heterosexual voice.  During this period he has just started rooming in the house of the family of a rich college friend (with whom, of course, he is enraptured).  He begins to observe the family which segways into the following years. <br /> <br />The remaining years recounted - later in eighties - surround observing this family and their \\"power\\" contacts as they try to amass greater wealth and influence.  The son who tried journalism, gave it up to go after riches.  The father is elected to Parliament with virtually no sentiment towards his constituency, only the thirst for power.  He hitches his star to M. Thatcher while still not letting go of the pursuit of the almighty pound.  The son breaks an engagement with the daughter of a huge mogul who eventually takes the father down financially.  Later, the daughter - who is always fighting depression - takes the rest of the family down by publicizing less than savory affairs.  The only nearly likeable character is the uncle who got all his wealth the old fashioned way - he inherited it. <br /> <br />Throughout the last years, the narrator, who continues graduate studies, has an affair with an enormously rich college friend who supports him and gives him a gift of cash - which, of course, he invests, so he too can get in on the riches of the eighties. <br /> <br />In the end, as the family is crumbling in and on the narrator, we learn that his first loverhas died of AIDS and his current lover is dying of it as well. <br /> <br />This novel is a long indictment of the \\"me only\\" eighties.  The narrator is a terrific observer who also gives us a view from the homosexual side of the street.  There are a few homosexual sex scenes in the book.  They are not overly graphic and would not bear comment were they scenes of heterosexual acts with the same level of graphic content. <br /> <br />There is not much uplifting about the book.  It takes a stark  and dim view of the power and riches seeking of the decade.  That was its strongest aspect.  It also takes what I would say is a very realistic view of homosexuality.  The author/narrator does not glorify nor villify it; he merely accepts it as a matter of fact.  The quick view of AIDS condemns loose sexual lifestyles. <br /> <br />I found the writing to be a bit overdone at times.  I can not say I particularly liked any character nor sympathized with the narrator.  Although primarily an observer, he too was rapt in himself. <br /> <br />Frankly, I do not know why this book one the Booker prize.  I think there could have been some PC voting because of the frank and open observations of the homosexual lifestyle by an openly gay character. <br /> <br />Not a great book, not a bad book, but I would not have given it any prizes.   <br /> <br />	2004-11-29

There is enough history to make this almost feasible.  If Lindbergh had not been so over the top for the Nazis, it actually could have happened.  That makes this alternative histroy novel such a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, Mr. Roth took this brilliant idea and looked at it from a very narrow view - that of a Jewish boy, age seven at the time of the election in 1940.    After Lindbergh is elected, anti-Semitism is allowed to grow and be expressed freely.  The boy watches this unfold as his father tries to fight back, his aunt and brother align with the American \\"Firsters\\", an orphaned cousin leaves for Canada to fight with the British and loses a leg (and his ideals) and the tensions pay the expected harsh results on the family.    Roth comes up with a few good ideas leading the family to believe that America is following the Nazi path to exterminate the Jews.  However, the book is exceedingly slow to get anywhere.  80% of the book recounts the two years (1940-42) during which there is only one suspicious program enacted by the Lindbergh administration and anti-semitism is allowed to find its voice.  Then Roth packs a huge amount of action into about twelve pages of newsreel accounts and finishes the book relating how the family lived through those events.  The book would have been far better had Roth spent more time on those events which were much more interesting than page after page of family angst.    Without revealing the ending, I will say it was a weak effort and was insubstantial in relation to the rest of the book.    I found the writing was also cumbersome.  Roth writes verrry long sentences.  For the fun of it, I checked one and found it went on for nineteen lines of print.  Long sentences can be fine, but many of Roth's were difficult to follow and I had to go back to the beginning of a sentence often to get its meaning.    The story is also told by the boy.  However, he is imbued with the insight and wisdom of an adult, so it is difficult to really see the story from his perspective through much of the book.  The father was a much more interesting character and the book would have been far richer if told through his eyes.    I wish Roth had expanded his focus and given a better look at how America may have been had Lindbergh been elected.  It is such fertile ground for thought and imagination to go wild.  The concept deserves a broader presentation.	2004-11-17

I seldom take the time to look for all the symbolism and significance in the books I read.  According to Professor Foster, that makes me a \\"literal reader\\".  This book pointed out some basic tenets of symbolism, irony and significance in an interesting and amusing manner that even a literal reader could see and appreciate.  Mr. Foster foists no guilt on the literal reader - the foremost reason to read according to him is for enjoyment. <br /> <br />Mr. Foster has chapters entitled such things as \\"It's All Shakespeare...\\" and \\"Unless its the Bible\\" that track major themes and ideas in literature.  He fills each chapter and substantiates each point with a myriad of examples.  <br /> <br />He also brings to the table a refreshing view that it's okay to not see every symbol and theme in a book - again, the main thing is to enjoy reading.  But reading this book has already made me try to be more aware of what an author is doing beyond the straight plot line.   <br /> <br />One thing that truly made me feel as if I were back in college was the annoying politic correctness.  There could have been a broader scope of fiction used (unless you believe that Toni Morrison's writings encompass virtually every literary theme).  Also, every time Mr. Foster raised the spectre of a hypothetical author it was \\"she\\" who was doing this in \\"her\\" work. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable book that is a good aid to any reader.  It would also be a great help to high school and college readers.	2004-11-09

Like an adolescent peregrine falcon sitting on a ledge screaming for its dinner this almost engaging book screams for an editor's blue pen. <br /> <br />This is a terrific story of two men who decide to follow the migrations, first to the arctic then to the tropics, of a few peregrine falcons in a beat up old Cessna.  That's the terrific story - their trials and tribulations and how they get caught in their mission after bonding with the little birds.  One a crusty old war pilot, the other a wildlife guide and author seem to be as different as night and day until they hook up with the peregrines. <br /> <br />The author, unfortunately, can not stop himself there.  Every time he sees another bird he must launch into either a description or some anecdote from his past involving that bird.  If that is not enough, we get to read about his snake and bear experiences as well.  Only a few of these asides were interesting.  Fewer added anything to the book.  By about page twenty we got the point that birds migrate an amazing distance.  It did not need to be hammered again every time a new specie was seen between the arctic circle and Belize.  The book needed some major paring down. <br /> <br />That being said, the primary story line of following the falcons was an intriguing vehicle to educate the reader.  The education was not only about the peregrines, but also the ecological changes in this hemisphere - bad then better but still wanting - in the last 250 years.  The author gives this education without being a demagogue, which is a difficult task. <br /> <br />Worth reading, but it could have been a lot better and easier to get through.  If this is the kind of book you enjoy, Aldo Leopold was writing it 60-70 years ago in the Sand County Almanac and others.	2004-11-02

Fleming throws a bit of tongue-in-cheek to add to the charm of the hero. <br /> <br />The gambit as devised by the Russians is terrific and nuanced.  Bond's floundering then overcoming then....well can't give the end is classic, yet still \\"delicious\\". <br /> <br />My one disappointment is that Bond never ordered a martini. <br /> <br />A fun and terrific read.  Fleming does spies as well as anyone, including LeCarre, but he does it with excitement and a bit of humor.  Highly, highly recommended.	2004-10-25

The man was arrested for murdering a white woman and he immediately implicated the three black women. <br /> <br />Ms Lebsock gives a detailed account of their trials, appeals and new trials.  The book is terrifically researched and the story(ies) good.  However, the telling never really flows.  The trial accounts are detailed and, by their nature, contain redundencies that grow tedious.  I found myself skimming over many of them as time went by.  The author does do a good job of portraying the defendants and their black newspaper owner supporter.  There is also good information about the first underpinnings of segregation in Virginia. <br /> <br />All in all a pretty good book, especially if you like trial accounts.  I wish the writing had been a bit smoother and the athor had stepped back and looked at the \\"bigger picture\\" of the trials a bit more often rather than reciting and repeating testimony.	2004-10-18

With flashbacks to the starvation and privation of the Irish during the potato famine and their travails getting to America, Mr. Baker draws a compelling picture of the immigrants and the city. He also sketches the racial hatred the Irish held for the blacks in the city. <br /> <br />Mr. Baker's descriptions are vivid and memorable. Some of his accounts of beatings and torture are sure to stay with the reader for a long long time. <br /> <br />His characters are also portrayed in a sometimes brutally frank manor. The novel is told from the perspective of half a dozen characters, most of whom are Irish. There are an Irish woman (her account includes flashbacks to Ireland) who marries a black man, a violent ne'er-do-well (also subject of flashbacks), a couple who have brought themselves up in the world - he a soldier and she a successful housewife and non-Irish prostitute, reporter (only first person narrative) and the black man. <br /> <br />I had some difficulty at the beginning of the book getting into the flow of the story as the set-up took several chapters since it was told by separate charcters who tales were somewhat slow in coming together in a cohesive manner. After that, the book flows and the writing excellent, especially the descriptive passages. <br /> <br />A caution: only one character is truly sympathetic and that is the black man. You want to root for his Irish wife too, but somehow you just can't. The other characters are nearly impossible to sympathize with which makes this book not a warm cuddly story. Warm and cuddly would not fit the three days of riots on which Mr. Baker focuses, however, so this is certainly not a criticism of the novel. <br /> <br />This book is recommended for a period of serious reading and thought. Not a light beach book by any means.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-13

Mitch Rapp, super CIA agent who gives no quarter to terorists, uncovers an al queda mission center in Pakistan.  After the special forces take the village they find plans for the ultimate terrorist attack against America and the chase is on. <br /> <br />Flynn weaves a great plot.  Like many of Follett's better works, Flynn narrates the story of both Rapp and the terrorists so you get to see what each is doing and try to figure out who is winning at any given time.  Flynn masterfully holds back just enough from the terrorists so the reader is never very far ahead of Rapp. <br /> <br />The author also mixes in a bevy of interesting extra characters so the reader gets to watch the politicoes as well as the hunter and the hunted. <br /> <br />There is also a fair amount of political philosophy in the book - pro and anti Patriot Act, what should a terrorist hunter be allowed to do, how do our laws hamper the terrorist fight, etc.  It is clear Flynn will not be invited to many Ted Kennedy cocktail parties, but the political themes do not insult the reader nor take away from the plot.   <br /> <br />The plot is a good one and keeps getting better all the way to the end.  Not only is this a fun spy thriller, it is a sobering look at what terrorists are capable of achieving.  A very timely book as well as an entertaining one.	2004-10-02

Mr. Lovesy is a very good police procedure mystery writer.  There is a nice dry with that adds to the telling of the story. <br /> <br />This is a double plus mystery.  It starts with the murder of an identified woman on a beach.  The tide takes out all the evidence and the investigation is headed by an interesting female CID.  Once the body is identified, Inspector Diamond gets involved because the victim is from his turf.  A serial killer then emerges and the investigations go hand-in-hand - sometimes. <br /> <br />Inspector Diamond is an obviously evolved character.  \\"Hen\\" as she is called is new to the series and a very good character with depth and personality.  The supporting characters are also believable and have their own characters.  It is a compliment to Mr. Lovesy that all the characters have depth and uniqueness. <br /> <br />The solving of the mysteries is interesting and fun.  My only criticism is that they get wrapped up so very fast.  I looked and so there were only ten pages to go and the serial killer still had to be identifed and caught.  It was disappointing, especially compared to the terrific build-up to that point. <br /> <br />A good mystery and highly recommended.	2004-09-29

Miraculously she survives and is saved by a near hermit former DA investigator (Hiassen seems to find nobility in hermits).  Together, they conspire to drive Chaz crazy by hiding the fact she is still alive and messing with his mind - much more fun than reporting the crime to the authorities. <br /> <br />Giving them assistance in driving Chaz over the edge is a good cast of supporting characters.  These include: a cop (who keeps pythons in his condo much to the chagrine of his elderly small pet owning neighbors) who knows, without any basis in fact, that Chaz murdered his wife; a hairy \\"bodyguard\\" hired by the rich polluter to watch over Chaz; Chaz' mistress who he describes as his housekeeper to the police (she'll give him some payback for that)and his sheepherder brother-in-law. <br /> <br />The humor is classic Hiaasen.  Off-color, out of main stream and in some cases, frankly, bizarre, but always witty and clever. <br /> <br />The ending was a weak point in this novel.  There were so many ways to finally get Chaz, it seemed as if Hiaasen could not decide the best way to do him in. <br /> <br />Although this is, in so many ways, typical Hiaasen in that it includes the save the everglades theme, has some strange characters, much off-beat humor and a hermit or two, Skinny Dip is sufficiently different from Hiaasen's other books to be fresh.  The unexpected twists and turns keep the reader's interest beyond the humor. <br /> <br />An thoroughly enjoyable romp through south Florida.	2004-09-20

This one is middle of the road for the series or mysteries in general. <br /> <br />Janeway buys a Richard Burton (19th century explorer, not the actor) book at auction, is interviewed on NPR and then is confronted by an elderly lady who tips him off to a valuable Burton collection \\"stolen\\" from her family.  He promises to recoup it and the chase is on leading him from Denver to Baltimore to Charleston.  Along the way he crosses paths with a psychotic henchman who follows him and his allies. <br /> <br />The mystery is not a terrific one.  The solution, sadly, is packed in the end with superpowers of deduction that the reader is not able to share.  The muscleman who chases him adds needed tension to the plot, but when all is said and done, he really was not part of the plot in chief - only there to add the tension and some violence. <br /> <br />What improves the book is the historical context of Richard Burton and a diary account of his trip south right before the Civil War.  Evidently there were some months missing in biographies of his life when he was in the United States.  Dunning has put him in the south with a suspicion that he was spying for England.  I wish Mr. Dunning would have given us more on what was historically accurate, theorized and full fiction in his historical note at the end of the book. <br /> <br />All in all this was a pretty good book.  As always, the tidbits on book collecting were interesting.  Most of the supporting characters to Janeway were good, although the mobster type was a cardboard cutout.  An enjoyable read, although not one of Dunning's better efforts. <br /> <br />	2004-09-15
US	51152027	R20AFL2G06T707	0385335814	370438124	The Summer Guest	Books	5	93	97	N	N	A Terrific book	Simply put, this is a terrific book. <br /> <br />The primary setting is a fishing camp/resort in northwest Maine.  The characters either have run, are running or will be running the place.  Their lives have all been touched significantly by one man - the summer guest who has returned to the camp every summer for more than thirty years. <br /> <br />The novel acounts for the six main characters' lives in the present and in reflections of the past.  The lives of the camp people are all tightly interwoven, since four are related (father, son and wife and grandson) and the fifth looks like he will marry into the family.  What shows through the telling of their stories is the major affect that the summer guest has had on their lives - and them on his. <br /> <br />The novel is written so that chapter to chapter the first person narrative changes from character to character.  A legitimate criticism is that Mr. Cronin does not give each a distinctive voice.  If I put the book down in mid-chapter, I might have to go back to see who was speaking.  The quality of this book well overrides this short-coming, however. <br /> <br />The stories of these characters are interesting, poignant and real.  They are accounts of lives, loves and deaths touchingly told.  What could have been a soap opera is so artfully told by Mr. Cronin that the book never became maudlin. <br /> <br />The characters are all likeable, yet very different in their own right with very human weaknesses and strengths.  They are perhaps the most believable characters I have read of in a long long time.  Except possibly for the gift given by the rich summer guest, Mr. Wainwright, the characters and their lives are all believable.  There are no superhuman efforts.  No pristine pure and perfect people.  It is easy to imagine each person and every event.  It is a tribute to fine writing and story-telling.  By the end of the book, not only does the reader feel as if he knows each character well enough to recognize him on the street, but it is conceivable that such people really do walk the streets - and it would be good to meet them. <br /> <br />This is definitely one of the best books of the year.  Read it and weep and laugh.	2004-09-10

However, it needed focus - or one hundred fewer pages. <br /> <br />The story surrounds the drowning/murder of a society debuttante on the beach in the Hamptons on Long Island.  What looks to be an obvious drowning does not satisfy the deputy chief (who is chasing his own demons) nor the fisherman who found the body.  They go off on their search for the truth independently of each other.   <br /> <br />The fisherman is an excellent character.  The deputy chief only okay.  I could never quite figure him out - his downfalls from before or his motivations currently.  They never added up to a believable persona.  The supporting characters are all good. <br /> <br />What detracted from this book are the constant reflections.  Those that had something to do with the primary characters added to the book.  Unfortunately, many did not move the book along at all and became somewhat tedious distractions.  At times, I felt as if the author had spent years researching the history and culture of eastern Long Island and wanted to use it all in this novel.   <br /> <br />Another positive of the book is that it did not fall into the trap of being a voice of the age-old conflict of rich summer folk vs poor year-rounders which it easily could have done.  Mr. Mills recognized the different cultures without slamming them over the head of the reader. <br /> <br />The book was good enough that if Mr. Mills writes another novel I would probably pick it up.	2004-09-07

More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting, it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.  There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.   <br /> <br />There were, however, HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors, actors, film-writers, magazines and books.  There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader. <br /> <br />Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again, there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book. <br /> <br />If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.   <br /> <br />There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between. <br /> <br />If you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.  I think Mr. Baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest.	2004-09-02

This one is no different in those positive attributes. <br /> <br />What is different is the book is written in two voices.  One a third person narrative and the other the narrative in the first person of Colin Lamb, one of the investigators of the murder. <br /> <br />The book also has two story-lines/mysteries, which takes Mr. lamb in and out of both. <br /> <br />As is so frequently the case with Agatha Christie, the murder is set up well.  A typist is requested by a blind woman who gives instructions to enter the house if she is not yet home.  When the typist enters the house she finds the body.  Of course, the blind woman never called her to type, the man was not identifiable and the inspector and Lamb are off on the hunt.  Lamb brings in Peroit, who does not take much space in the book, but, of course, solves the crime from his armchair. <br /> <br />As usual, a thoroughly enjoyable novel by Christie who never writes the same story twice and always, as here, seems to have an added twistl.	2004-08-27

I appreciated the good writing but was disapointed in the plot line, so vowed to pick this book up and give Mr. Wolff another try.  I was very pleased I did. <br /> <br />One's first thought after reading this book is: How could someone with such a messed up up-bringing turn out so well?  It must be like the blues - you have to have a tough youth to make it in the memoir category. <br /> <br />This is the story of Mr. Wolff's youth where he follows his mother from one abusive man to another.  Much of the book is centered on the years with his first step-father who is: a) a drunk; b) abusive to him; and, c) constantly accuses him of being a liar, a fraud and a cheat in one form or another.  It turns out that the step-father is right.  However, most of the time young Wolff gets away with his drinking, stealing and fraud, thanks in part to his mother's belief he can do no wrong.  <br /> <br />One of the most impressive things about this memoir is that Wolff gives himself no quarter.  Not only does he recognize the bad things he does, he recognizes his bad motives and bad thoughts - even those that do not get acted upon.  He is brutally honest about himself.  Also, without saying outright, he recognizes his mother's weakness in picking men. <br /> <br />Again, Mr. Wolff's writing is terrific.  It is fittingly stark for the portrayal of the subject matter.  The descriptions of the other characters in his life and Chinook and Concrete (the towns in which he lived and went to high school, respectively) draw a perfect picture.   <br /> <br />This memoir is well worth the time.  It will stay with you for long after the reading.	2004-08-23

Rather than worrying about reviews, the time would have been better spent proofing the copy.  Besides countless typographical errors, there were more basic errors.  For instance, I never could tell whether one character lived on a houseboat or in a boathouse. <br /> <br />This is ostensibly a thriller.  The plot is very basic.  So basic it gets completely lost in the over 400 pages of ridiculously irrelevant detail.  The story is amateurish and the writing mediocre. <br /> <br />An example of the amateur nature:  There are three female characters.  All are drop dead gorgeous and all three are willing to lay down their lives for men they had met only a few days before.  Such love and romance begs reality. <br /> <br />The plot plods through a few different disparate story-lines.  First there is an interminable travelogue description of the \\"heroes\\" trip to Pakistan.  Then an interminable hospital stay in Pakistan - from which they are rescued in a flash of about eight pages.  Then a research doctor's instant love affair with a grad student that takes scores of pages to complete followed by an explosion, murder and turning of the doctor to an Afghani operative - in about ten pages.  Then...well it goes on.  This is the nature of the writing.  The \\"set-up\\" for every action in the novel is at least thirty times as long as the action part. <br /> <br />The author is an ophthamologist and it is apparent.  His attention to detail is maddening - good for a doctor, not for an author.  In the midst of scores of pages of romance between two characters (who are not that important in the grand scheme) he tells us such important things as the coffee was made with eight scoops of grounds!  Maddening! <br /> <br />The concept of the plot was good.  Unfortunately it was pounded into oblivion by plodding story-telling and mountains of irrelevant details and minor subplots.  It could have been a decent 230 page novel rather than 450+. <br /> <br />This book can easily be skipped.  Read Kite Runner - it is a classic - if you want a dose of Afghanistan.	2004-08-17

I enjoyed the beginning; by a third of the way through I was ready to put it down; two-thirds through I was enjoying it and did so until the disappointing end. <br /> <br />The novel follows a handful of Chicagoans who are tangentially related to each other.  Very few are likeable.  The ones with the most written about them seem to be the least likeable.  There is really no plot line, per se, only the tracking of these lives from early winter of 1979 into 1980.  There are no major awakenings or epiphanies - only the plodding of the characters. <br /> <br />Mr. Langer does, however, bring out all the self-centerness and narcissism of the early eighties. At times he nears the satirical with some of his character portrayals.  This view is the best aspect of the book.   <br /> <br />He also shows that there can be books written with Jewish characters set outside of New York City.  There is a lot about the Jewish culture here.  Perhaps were I a bit more familiar with that culture, more would have been understandable or I would have had more empathy at times. <br /> <br />This is a dense book with very little dialogue.  Much of what is spoken is described rather than put in print, much as someone telling a story would relate a conversation.  Unfortunately, in this novel that trick came off as cold and cynical rather than warm.   <br /> <br />Cold and cynical are the adjectives most apt for the characters and their views on life.  Both the youth and the adults seem to have lost their way and purpose in life - if the purpose is other than self-interest. <br /> <br />This was an interesting book - at times difficult to push through and at other times pulling the reader along into these characters lives.  In all, I am glad I read it, but I did not find it nearly as good as Little Children, another book trying to capture the everyday lives of everyday people in an interesting light.	2004-08-17

It is more like a 2 1/2 star effort. <br /> <br />As usual his main characters are very likeable - a suburban housewife and her kidnapped husband are people you want next door.  The housewife/artist is the star and the presumptive solver of the mystery. <br /> <br />The mystery starts off well with a mystery picture slipped into apple-picking prints at photomart.  From there the story spirals, occasionally out of control.  There is a cool bad guy, but the reader is given no real idea of who is or why he is there until the plot is sorted out at the very end.  There is really no build-up.  There is only event after event after event, none of which go together well.  Suddenly - like an epiphany - the plot is resolved in the last ten pages or so.  The answers seem to appear out of no where.  htere is little telling how Mrs. Suburbia unraveled it all. <br /> <br />Besides the good characters - and there are a few good ones other than the couple and the abductor, there is not much to recommend this book.  All of Coben's others are far superior.	2004-08-09

It is a wonderful look at the values held by folks just scraping by in a hard-hitting (literally), hard-dancing hard-living area. <br /> <br />The novel gives a look at a young  - in age and maturity - couple living deep in the bayou.  Starting during the oil boom, it continues ionto the bust.  The couple starts together for a very short time, breaks up, head west separately, return home separately and end up together.  Throughout this odyssey, they both grow at different paces and for different reasons.  They both come of age through some very hard times. <br /> <br />Mr. Gautreaux's is very good.  The story moves well carrying the reader along on a relentless dance of the two characters' lives.  Dancing is throughout the book - in reality and metaphorically.  Better than his writing is Mr. Gautreaux's depiction of his characters.  They are given depth that makes them realistic.  They both have foibles that make them believable and they both have the inconsistencies of youth trying to reach their dreams and adults who find their dreams were not what they thought they were. <br /> <br />A great homage to family roots and small towns, this book is entertaining as well as thought-provoking.	2004-08-09

It certainly is a good one for discussion groups.  It has such issues as: WWI veteran with post traumatic stress disorder, love of brothers, capitalism, deforestation for profit, race relations, organized crime and police corruption.  I am sure any group can add to that list of themes and subthemes.  Somehow in all of that was a plot. <br /> <br />There is something dark and haunting about this book.  In 1923, the wealthy younger brother comes to a depressing swamp in Louisiana to operate a sawmill where his brother (veteran with ptsd) happens to be the sheriff.  The brother is there to reap the profits from clear-cutting the cypress forest and bring his older brother back into the family fold.  Against this backdrop is a running feud with the mafia. <br /> <br />There is a constant motif of death and injury in this horribly depressing locale, yet somehow the book and characters keep plodding.  I think that is the root of the haunting nature of the book.  The reader is forced to think - why are they still there and still doing what they are doing? <br /> <br />Teh two brothers are good characters as is another sheriff.  The other characters are not nearly so well developed and seem to be cut-outs whose only function is to serve the brothers' plots. <br /> <br />I can not say the plot is a great one.  Nor are the characters ones that a reader can warm to or root for.  However, taken all together, this is a dark and well-written book worth the effort.  It started slowly, but picked up to an ending that one would not have anticipated at the outset.  I expect this will be a book that stays with the reader long after completion.	2004-07-29

Mr. Perrotta strips all romance from such talismans as child-rearing. <br />  <br /> The impetus for the plot-lines in the book are children - little children. There are a few threads that run through - the parents who meet on the playground and have an affair, the child molester who moves into the neighborhood to be haunted by an ex-cop child-killer; the super-mom who loses all passion in her life and the wife of the stay-at-home dad who is envious of his life style. <br />  <br /> Throughout are characters unhappy with their &quot;plights&quot; but who lead lives that appear to be ideal, such as the mother who craves adult stimulation, the working mother who wants to stay at home and the super-mom who looks to be losing everything by the end. The character closest to happiness is the stay-at-home dad who is hounded to go to work to support his family. He is the man in the affair, but will he run off? <br />  <br /> Like all good satires, the aspect of each personality brought most to focus is the one that the author wishes to brandish so the reader can lampoon it or defend it on his own. What makes this an exceptionally good work is that the characters are very believable. Only the ex-cop is a bit over the top in his vigilanteism.  <br />  <br /> The emotions that Mr. Perrota brings to the surface are all ones that every parent of young children has felt at one time or the other. Thus the book rings so true. He just infuses these thoughts and feelings in a rather pure state in each of his characters. <br />  <br /> A very well-written book that keeps moving. An entertaining and thought-provoking look at lives of parents in our modern day of working and non-working parents. Strongly recommended.	2004-07-27

The woman is an FBI agent and, of course, something more.  Reacher and she are taken to the outpost of a militia intent on declaring its independence from the USA and doing other unmentionable (here) malicious things. <br /> <br />As usual, Reacher is up to the task - and more.  Using his inhuman ability to analyze every problem and shoot every gun known he once again prevails.  Like all the Reacher novels, this is action-packed with some good twists and turns in the plot.  The super bad guy was a bit over the top, but part of enjoying these books is suspending belief for a time. <br /> <br />A good, fun action-packed read for a period of escapism.  Great beach reading.	2004-07-21

The main character was in the former work and there are a few mentions of the battle. <br />  <br /> This is the story of a Confederate veteran returning to his home town which has been partially burned out and is now occupied by Federal soldiers. He returns to court his old love interest - the daughter of a judge who had forced him to enlist. Additionally, a leader of an outlaw Confederate guerilla group is mounting a campaign to retake the town. That outlaw band had burned out the home of the judge's daughter (Love interest's sister) and hanged his son-in-law. The outlaw's return causes conflict with the main characters and the Federals, leaving Confederate veterans fighting side by side with the federals in the brief skirmish. <br />  <br /> The book takes a hard look at the difficulties encountered by a returning veteran to a town on the losing side; the difficulties the town has in coping with its demolished and occupied state and those who do not want to say die; and, the outlaw who wants the South to rise again under his leadership.  <br />  <br /> The view is a raw and disturbing one. The characters are very memorable.  <br />  <br /> Mr. Bahr's writing is unique. At times it is near poetic. Also at times, the writing itself captures the raw emotion running through the book. Unlike Black Flower, however, at times the wording became a bit cumbersome and the writing got in the way. <br />  <br /> Still, a book recommended. If there is one word to describe the book, it would be &quot;haunting&quot;. The story-line, the characters, the emotion, all are haunting and will stick with the reader long after.	2004-07-20

Unfortunately, what plot there was was thin as well as the character/narrator.  There were passages that made reference to narrator's supposed awakenings and new awareness of his self, but I frankly did not see much progress in him.<br />Parts of the book read as if essays had been patched together.  There is an interesting portion of the book devoted to a dean of the school that did not move the plot forward nor give any greater understanding of the narrator.  It was probably the best part of the book and the only character delved into with any depth.  However, it seemed unrelated to the story line - such as it was - and did not lead to any greater understanding of the narrator.<br />Another portion of the book related to plagiarism.  It suddenly happened, was explored very little and seemed to be passed over as a minor incident in the narrator's life.  Again, it seemed like an essay patched into the book.<br />As can be seen by the book descriptions, much of the book centers around authors who would visit the school.  Students competed to write the winning story or poem.  Much of the descriptions and excerpts from these young authors were cleverly done and amusing - not in a comedic sense but in how they related to the celebrity author's works.<br />One aspect of the book I found to be extremely presumptuous.  Three authors were came, or were to come to the school: Frost, Rand and Hemingway.  Mr. Wolff gives them pages of monologue (especially Frost and Rand) in which they espouse their personal philosophies - some of which were not flattering.  I find there is a slippery slope when using real figures in fiction and I thought Mr. Wolff had slid down that slope at his peril.  What experience does he have with these people to paint such pictures of them and put those words in their mouths?  Especially such unflattering words and pictures?<br />What did not disappoint, however, as noted, was the writing.  Mr. Wolff writes a fine clear, concise prose that is enjoyable to read.  Although I can not strongly recommend this book, I will read his other works based upon the promise of that writing.	2004-07-15

If I had not read Tooth and Nail before, I would not pick up another.<br />The first hundred pages were completely muddled.  The book finally got on path, only to lose it again in the last hundred pages.  <br />Rebus - a loveable rebel cop in Tooth and Nail came off as a depressed and depressing malcontent and know-it-all.<br />The central plot is a very good one - a serial killer is emulating a serial killer from years before.  The first, Bible John, returns to stalk the second, Johnny Bible.  The first (potential) murder is also a good hook.  But then, so much is added.  At the same time Rebus is working on this (potential) murder he is still obsessing about the Bibles.  During this time he is also being investigated for a murder investigation he did a decade before.  The investigation runs among four locales.  It is no wonder much of the book is confused.  There are too many plot lines Rankin has difficulty bringing them together.<br />I intend to go on with the Rebus series since the reviews are so good.  I doubt this one is necessary to understand the series.  I wish I had skipped it and gone on to #3.	2004-06-29
US	51152027	RO1SPEM6LXXWU	0451210743	712732369	Hornet Flight	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Follett Lite	Follett's forte is WWII spy novels.  This one fits the genre but is not up to his usual standard.  It is a fast read - mostly because there is not much there.<br />A Danish 18 year old mechanical genius gets drawn into the spy game when he stumbles upon a German radar installation.  His older brother also gets drawn in by his English fiance.  When older brother asks younger about the installation they realize it would be better for younger to photograph it.  While he's on that trip, older brother gets captured and kills himself before he can be turned over to the Gestapo.  Of course, the younger also developes a romantic interest who helps him reconstruct a two seat airplane to take them and the photographs to England.<br />Follett leaves much to the imagination - or gullibility - of the reader.  Somehow these two young people repair this broken plane in just a few days while working right next to a German encampment (conveniently placed so they can get petrol).<br />The characters are likeable and believable.  The pages turn quickly thanks to Follett's good, clean crisp style.  The Danish cop with a grudge against the brothers' family is a wonderfully evil character.<br />The plot is simple, yet good.  The book just lacks depth to give it a higher rating.  Still in all, a fun read - good for the beach.	2004-06-29

More aptly, it should have been entitled: &quot;Downtrodden Women of Iraq&quot;.<br />The prologue explains that the author persuaded the Bookseller, Sultan Kahn, to allow her to live with his family.  He is a successful businessman and a traditional Afghani male head of household.  The book does not track him so much as it does the rest of the family.<br />The book takes place after the fall of the Taliban.  The author gives the reader little knowledge or information about what is going on in Kabul or the country as whole.  Instead she goes into the minutae of the family's life with an especial emphasis on the women.  There are endless descriptions of burkhas and the tribulations of wearing them.  Endless descriptions of arranged marriages and the relationship - or rather lack thereof - between unmarried men and women.<br />The writing is merely okay.  Something might have been lost in translation because there is certainly nothing challenging in the vocabulary.  At times the writing seemed demeaningly elementary - we'll blame the translator.<br />The book has intimate insight into an Afghani middle class family - the oppressively traditional father, women under the yoke of that tradition and the filthy living conditions.  For all of that it is very good.<br />I was hoping for a bit more of the &quot;big picture&quot; of a country (hopefully) coming out of decades of war.  There was very little along that vein.  This was a few month look at one family.<br />All in all, an okay book.  Good if you are looking for Afghani family life.  Not so good if you are looking for something more.	2004-06-22

There is so much to write about on the one hand, yet it is so simple on the &quot;big picture&quot; side.<br />First, the writing.  It is excellent.  At times I just wanted to savor the words and the thoughts, yet Mr. Kendra's writing style kept me moving.  That is a wonderful combination, when you want to slow, but the writing contains an innate excitement that keeps your eyes moving.<br />Next, the &quot;memoir&quot;.  Mr. Kendra's life is the ancillary aspect of the book.  He is the main supporting cast to the Father Joe.  Mr. Kendra is brutally honest about himself - one can not help but think that he was a better person than he portrays himself to be.<br />The book tracks the author's spiritual life starting with an affair with a married woman when he was 14 years old which causes him to meet of Father Joe, with whom he mantains a relationship for the next few decades.  After that meeting, the author spends several years planning and plotting to become a Benedictine monk.  After finding comedy as a new object of worship, he completely abandons his faith, loses a wife and almost a second before he comes back to the fold.<br />That rendition gives the book such short shrift.  It is filled with thought-provoking ideas about self, faith and relationships without getting sappy or tawdry.  Father Joe is his friend, father, mentor and spiritual adviser who stays with him throughout leading him without pressure into self-realization.<br />If there is one theme of this book, it is not God or religion or even faith.  It is the ability of a person to delude himself.  Father Joe is instrumental in showing Kendra that lesson.  The Benedictine idealism is Kendra's illusionary safe harbor that allows him to stray - it will always be there to redeem him if he needs it.<br />The book obviously has depth of feeling.  It has gentle humor and brazen candor that prevents it from being sappy.  It also contains philosophy and quotations from great thinkers that add a universality that will appeal to non-Catholics and even non-Christians.  Those additions give the book an intellectual heft lacking in books like The Five People I Met in Heaven.<br />One criticism and word of caution.  Have a dictionary close by - Kendra's vocabulary is envy inspiring.  The criticism is that I wish he had included a few more translations of terms and passages.<br />I can not recommend this book highly enough.  This is a book I know I will return to - if not to read in full, then at least to enjoy again portions of its wisdom and wit.	2004-06-14

Jackdaws did not disappoint.<br />It is the story of an all woman team sent to France to perform espionage just before D-Day.  The main character/hero is an engaging woman and her cast of compatriots is interesting.  The action is non-stop as can be expected.  As also can be expected, nothing seems to go right, but the good guys win in the end - that formula by no means detracts from the book.<br />Jackdaws also displays a formula that Follett uses to great success - he tracks both sides of the plot - the German policeman after the team of women and the women.  He switches back and forth in such a way as to always add tension with the switch.<br />Also adding to this book is the German spy-catcher.  He is given a personality and expresses sympathy at times.  He is not the prototypical Nazi bad guy.<br />One thing that detracted from this book are the love interests.  Out of a major cast of about ten, five fall in love in the course of the two weeks encompassed by the book.  Not to mention that three of the characters are or end up homosexual.  The odds on both counts seem skewed.<br />All in all a fun book.  As always with Follett, well-written.  It is typical of the genre, but still exciting and worth the read.	2004-06-09

Mr. Zachs obviously pored over thousands of pages of material - unfortunately, he had a difficcult time culling what was not relevant enough to add to the book.  He simply included too much material.<br />This is the story of Captain Kidd - pirate or not?  Mr. Zachs is persuasive that Kidd was not a pirate but a privateer with a commission from the King's highest confidantes.  Mr. Zachs tracks Kidd on his privateering journey along with that of a pirate living a parallel career named Culliver.  The juxtaposition of the two is well done.  Kidd - honorable to a fault, and to a noose - fights becoming a pirate.  Culliver, on the other hand, lives the pirate's life throughout, avoids the noose and walks off with a fortune in ill-gained booty.<br />Th problem I had with this book is that Mr. Zachs included sooo many details that the forest was often lost for the trees.  There were constant recitations of cargo statistics and individual's shares of booty.  These were detailed to the last bale of cloth and last piece of eight.  He carried these detailed recitations to journeys of other ships only very tangentially related to the theme.<br />I wish Mr. Zach's had left out a few hundred statistics relating to cargo and focused more on the broad picture.  He gave short shrift to how the backers of the mission avoided the scandal of being associated to Kidd and how England had been turned against the man.<br />If you want a well-detailed and well-researched tome about piracy and Kidd this is the book for you.  If you want a clear picture of the forces driving Kidd and his eventual demise, you have to work too hard with this book to get it.  I would only recommend this book to those who are deeply into piracy and its history.	2004-06-07

The young man gets involved (as a priest only) with a woman who eventually is murdered.  The confessional and the problems it brings to the priest are central to the plot.<br />I did not find the priest sympathetic.  I actually did not like him even though he was a good-hearted sort.  He came off as whiny and cold somehow.  The position of the monsignor and church higher-ups is virtually indecipherable.  I could not tell if Mr. Kenneally thought them wise or heartless.  <br />There is a lot of tension brought by what the proper role of a priest should be.  I found that part of the book interesting.  However, the plot line was predictable and, as noted, the characters did not add much to the book.  Even the &quot;bad guy&quot; was predictable, although the last portion of the book when the bad guy is identified is the best part.  Unfortunately, you have to trod through a few hundred pages of drudgery to get there.	2004-06-01

By the end, it is obvious that Mr. Parry had already written the next one.  Much of the first half of this book is a long introduction to the main character - Abel Jones - including his beliefs, personal history and values.  At times it touched on tedious.<br />Abel Jones gets chosen, for some unknown reason, by Gen. MacLellan to find the murderer of a well-known abolitionist officer.  Once the introductory portion is done, Jones actually gets on the case and the book picks up considerably.  The plot becomes the core rather than the character and that plot is fairly good.<br />Mr. Parry captures Civil War Washington very well.  His caricatures of the well-known charcters are terrific.  One could picture Gen. MacLellan by the author's description and understand his personality perfectly in just the few pages devoted to him.<br />On the last page of the book, the author tells the reader that the adventures of Abel Jones are continued in the next book.  That is fitting since the preceding few pages are devoted to his being hired on for more tasks.  Athough I did not think so on page 100 or so, I am looking forward to the further adventures of Abel Jones.	2004-06-01

This is the story leading up to the famous meeting and after.<br />Mr. Dugard does a wonderful job relating the biographies of the main characters - Stanley and Livingstone - as well as tangential men who were integral to this saga.  He also places the characters well into the historical context of the times.  He captures well not only the facts but he captures the characters including their foibles and weaknesses.<br />The best part of this book was getting to know the men involved - thankfully they were all prolific writers themselves.  I found some of the recounting of both Livingstone's and Stanley's travels a bit tedious, which is why this is a four star rather than a five.  Also the mapping might have been better.<br />All in all, a very good biography of two interesting men of the nineteenth century.	2004-05-20

I found the main character - Jack Reacher - a bit implausible at times.  He always figured everything out that no one else could and overcame his enemies against all odds.  I had difficulty warming up to him, but I imagine that is a result of not knowing the character from earlier books.  The person who told me about Child said I needed to go back to earlier Reacher novels to get the essence of the character.  In Persuader, Reacher is dropped in the reader's lap without any expalnation as to the make-up of the character, which is fine (and probably a bonus) for the reader who knows him, but short shrift for those who do not.  Even without any background, the reader can easily see that Reacher is a loner who will drive himself to achieve his ends and bend or break rules whenever necessary.  He is a cold-blooded warrior trying to &quot;make things right&quot;.<br />That having been said, I enjoyed this book.  Reacher recognizes a nemesis from ten years before who he thought was dead.  When he does some basic questioning, the DEA is all over him and puts him on a mission to help them.  He only doess so for his own ends - to get the nemesis.  Child weaves the story from ten years before nicely into the present day plot so as to add depth to the main plot line.  <br />Although, as noted, Reacher seems to be a super-hero, he and his Federal agent back-ups make some glaring errors that come back to haunt him and keep the plot moving with terrific misdirection.<br />This is a stark, well-written thriller/mystery.  Child really can do a great plot.  Not only do I recommend this book, I will go back and begin at Jack Reacher's beginning.	2004-05-20

This Civil War novel is Red Badge of Courage meets Cold Mountain.  <br />It is a terrific account of the Battle of Franklin told through several extremely interesting and captivating characters.  There are no real battle scenes.  Mr. Bahr begins with the minutes before the battle commences and then jumps to the aftermath.<br />The characters are unforgettable from the good to the bad.<br />Mr. Bahr's writing is as memorable as the characters.  It is near poetry in places, yet he also supplies terrific dialogue.  After reading - then rereading - a particularly good description, I would then become rapt in the dialogue.<br />This book captures the horrors of war.  One warning, if you have a tendency to eat while reading, you might want to diet through some of the scenes.  The author's descriptive powers are immense whether he portraying a piece of scenery or the battlefield hospital. <br />Bahr shows well the realistically ugly side of war while stringing a thread of romance between a soldier and a woman and the bonds of friendship between life-long soldiers/friends through the book.<br />This is a book to read with time on your hands so the writing can be savored.  You need not be a Civil War buff to appreciate this novel.	2004-05-11

RObert Parker writes good page-turning mysteries and this one is in his upper echelon.<br />Jesse Stone is a big-time L.A. cop who comes to be the chief of police in a small Massachusetts town.  In this novel he solves two crimes - one a local rape and the other a serial killer.  Along the way he has relationships with several women including an ex-wife he can not surrender.  (Somehow, this middle-aged taciturn guy keeps getting the babes, but somehow it works.)<br />The reader will find himself rooting for Stone in the rape matter and being very satisfied with its conclusion.  <br />In the serial killer plot, Stone's adversary is extremely unique and interesting.  To tell more would be to ruin the first third of the book but suffice it to say Parker has masterfully created a challenging nemesis for his hero.<br />Parker's writing, as always, is clean, concise and keeps the story moving.  A good page-turner of a mystery.	2004-05-11

The story is of a detachment of Marines getting themselves and any other Marines they can get to join them out of China after war with Japan breaks out.  <br />Since there is nothing from the author about how much of this tale is true, I am assuming that much of it is fiction and thus the lower grade.  Along with the Marines come fortuitous stragglers including a paleontologist who seemingly knows every inch of Mongolia - as well as the language There is also a White Russian prince who aids and abets the detachment when they get to Russia as well as teaching the Marines the handy dandy Molotov cocktail when it happens to be the perfect weapon.<br />Thus the story seems contrived.  Additionally, the star of the book, Captain Port, does something in the end of the book that does not fit the Marine's personality at all and truly seemed contrived.<br />If I could believe more of this book were true, it would be much better in the truth stranger than fiction genre.  As pure fiction, however, I found it lacking.  There was some good background material about China and the times that made it more palatable and worth finishing.  For those who, like me, loved Guns of Autumn, this was a major letdown.	2004-04-30

I had a very difficult time finishing it.  The underlying premise of the book - a man, Max, who ages backwards is great and had great potential.  Unfortunately, the potential was not realized.<br />Max is obsessed - and I do not mean that in a complimentary way -with Alice whom he first meets when she is 14 and he appears to be in fifties, although in reality is 17.  After meeting her the book consists of his seeking and wooing of her, his feelings for her and his endless analysis and self-analysis.  I found nothing endearing about the man or this(ese) relationship(s).  I got to the point where I had lost all sympathy for him, which is difficult for a person in his situation.<br />I found the writing cumbersome; like something you would expect in a romance novel.  Max is telling the story when he has reached his elder years in the body of a thirteen year old.  The tone, especially towards the end, gains an unappealing snideness that prevented me from sympathizing with him at all.  Early on, I had lost all rooting interest in the &quot;hero&quot; anyway.<br />The affair with the mother was one amusing part of the book.  The author could have done so much more with such a terrific premise.  It is unfortunate he did not.	2004-04-30

In particular, those parts recounting the author's play in the World Series of Poker, the history of card-playing, specifially poker, and his primer on the game of Texas Hold 'Em and its strategy.<br />Unfortunately, I think the author was self-conscious about making himself the star of the book.  He therefore added a superfluous account of the murder of Ted Binion and parts of the trial of his accused murderes.  These parts did not add to the book, but they did not detract either.<br />Other parts did detract, however.  For instance, there was no need for a chapter on an obscure poet who had committed suicide (except perhaps to show that the author considered himself a poet before an autobiographer).  So also his many pages devoted to other works on poker were tedious.  Worst, he repeatedly tried to put poker onto a tremendously lofty plain by making grand philosophical leaps about its place in humankind.<br />This book easily would have been a four star, perhaps a five star, effort if the author had stuck to the game of poker generally, its strategy and the hugely entertaining recap of his participation in the tournament.  An editor should have told him it would have been okay to leave it at that.	2004-04-26

After his firing by Carter he returns to law and then to his own foundation/think tank to combat addictions of all types.  <br />In addition to the professional bio he balances enough personal history to understand the man without violating his own and his family's privacy.  To leave it as an autobiography would be a great disservice to this book.<br />Oftentimes when we seek to understand our government we go back into history - to Jefferson, Hamilton or either Roosevelt.  One of the most meritorious aspects of this memoir is that it helps us to understand the workings of our government through the much more relevant history of the past three and a half decades.  Because Mr. Califano was in close to the major domestic issues of this time period (he happily had nothing to do with Viet Nam), the reader can see and understand the inner workings of the government.  When Johnson powered through his domestic agenda of civil rights and the Great Society, Califano was one of his prime engineers.  It was easy to see, and Califano shapes this point well, that the government was a smaller more intimate, less partisan institution back then run by powerful men (almost exclusively) who were not reliant on special interest money.<br />The book is a dense 494 pages with not a wasted word or page.  It would be too cumbersome to go through each and every interesting topic covered in this book.  As interesting as the topics covered is the viewpoint of the author.<br />Mr. Califano is a conservative Catholic with liberal politics.    As liberal as he is and as religious as he is - both by his own admission - there was no agenda to this memoir.<br />There are lessons, however.  One of the lessons he learned best from his Jesuit upbringing and he passes to the reader is the burden we all should share of social service.  He obviously sees social service as a higher calling.  Even when he was minting money in private practice of law he found the most satisfying cases those with social impact. He also made friend on both sides of politics.  One would not expect such a liberal to count as a best friend Al Haig, but he does.  The philosophy of doing battle during the day and remaining cordial and gentlemanly also came through loud and clear.<br />Mr. Califano could well have come off preachy or holier than thou, yet he did not at all.  He espoused his philosophies without being demagogic and was never reluctant to admit his mistakes, short-comings and foibles.<br />This is a terrific book about an interesting man who lived through the most interesting domestic events of the 60's, 70's and 80's (most of the book centered on the 90's was more personal than historic).  It is well-told and captivating.  I consider myself politically conservative and I enjoyed every page of it.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys autobiographies and is interested in the seminal domestic events of the sixties to nineties.	2004-04-14

As he hunts for the gory killer, he faces prejudice of the locals, a love interest and his daughter (by divorced wife) dating a criminal.<br />The mystery is a good one.  The serial killer mutilates his victims but, unlike some other authors, this is not a major theme.  It is raised, but not dwelled upon - leaving more to the imagination and fewer pages devoted to gore.<br />The author's descriptive passages are his strongest writing.  The description of the autopsy is unforgettable, yet he again does not dwell on long passages of grossness or gore.  He concentrates on the perceptions being experienced by the good Inspector. <br />Inspector Rebus is thoroughly likeable.  He is human, fallible and uncertain in many of the steps he takes.  Yet he pursues hunches and acts on reflex, sometimes to his detriment.  His relationship with the lead London inspector, George Flight, is described realistically through all its ups and downs.<br />I found this to be a very well-written book with characters who were believable and likeable.  I generally hesitate to read serial killer mysteries because so many use excessive gore to make up for thin plotlines.  This book had a very good plot/mystery and excellent writing.  I strongly recommend it to mystery lovers.	2004-04-05

It is filled with platitudes and the author's version of heaven and what he thinks is life wisdom.<br />The book traces the main character's death and path to heaven.  What you can read between the lines is that Eddie was a pretty unhappy and unlikeable guy in life (presumably modelled after the uncle to whom the book was dedicated).  The path to heaven according to Mr. Albom goes through five meetings with people who touched a person, eevn tangentially, during life.  Through these people, a person sees that every story is connected and there is redeeming value to every miserable happening on earth.<br />The writing was decent but I just could not get past the point that this was one person's opinion about life and heaven.  Regrettably, I did not find that opinion to be reasoned, challenging or intellectually stimulating.  There was nothing to make the reader think that author was a great mind whose opinion on such a subject as the afterlife should be given any more credence than anyone else's.  Much of what was passed as \\"Wisdom\\" could have come out of a fortune cookie, a \\"thought for a day\\" calendar of from the guy next door.<br />I actually found the flashbacks to Eddie's life the most interesting parts of the book.  The heaven part did nothing for me except make me worry that I was getting too much saccharin for one day.	2004-03-29

Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg was one of the best histories I have ever read.  This was not even good.<br />&quot;Samurai William&quot; - William Adams - is almost an afterthought in the book.  Rather the book is page after page of anecdotal information about members of Britain's East India Company in Japan.  There is far more information about their parties, girlfriends, gifts given and received and the like than anyone needs or would find interesting.<br />More troubling, is that Mr. Milton was so bogged down in the minutae, that no broad picture was ever painted.  The anecdotal history had no context.  Therefore it was merely tedious.  Had there been a thesis or broad stroke backdrop, the anecdotes might have fleshed out the narrative.  Instead the history was notably thin and left me with very little to take away.<br />The title character is most often a tangential figure.  He is always called upon to bail out the other Englishmen because of his closeness to Japan's rulers.  Mr. Milton never quite explains (or even theorizes) why he was so revered by the Japanese.  Surprisingly, at the end of the book, he notes that an area was named for Adams and he was still revered 200 years later.  No explanation was given why.<br />I strongly recommend that you skip this and go to Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg.  I got the strong feeling that the author had researched thousands of pages of East India Company documents and figured he ought to get another book out of the effort.  It needed much more Japanese history and culture explanations to make it worthwhile.	2004-03-26
US	51152027	R1I1GPKIHCLJ2L	0446612537	289602035	Open and Shut	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good Page Turner	This debut novel is a fast-paced page turner.  The main character is engagingly witty and smart without being superhumanly clever - a terrific mix for a main character in a mystery.  <br />The plot revolves around the main character's appeal of a defendant on death row.  He was encouraged to represent the man by his father who had successfully prosecuted the alleged criminal and who had put him on death row.  The new trial is granted and the plot spins around the trial and a thirty-five year old picture of the father with three friends.  <br />The plot has some interesting twists and turns, but what sustained the tension and kept the book moving were the courtroom scenes.  The cross-examination and strategy were interesting and, again, at times amusing.  Points are scored by the defense, but there is no Perry Mason moment - much more realistic and true to life.<br />Your life will not be turned around by this book, but you will be exceedingly entertained.  I recommend it as a mystery with some laughs and some good courtroom scenes.	2004-03-26

This is a five star book because of the writing.  Never have I read a book such as this where the writing was crafted so that it became such an integral part of the telling and the novel.<br />The plot is rather simple.  Christopher, the narrator, is an autistic teenager.  He finds a dog that has been murdered and decides to solve the crime.  From there the novel moves into a family in crisis.  Christopher is told his mother has died, only to find that is not the case.  Eventually he travels on his own to London - quite a feat for him.<br />What separates this book from the norm, though is how the author uses his writing - the telling - of the story to assist in the telling.  An example is in order.<br />At one point, Christopher is in atrain station in London.  This is a boy who hates crowds, strange places, strangers, new details in his surroundings, etc.  Not surprisingly, he is on the verge of panic while trying to stay sane, no less get out of the station somehow.  While reading, I came to a point where I said to myself: &quot;Whoa! Slow down! This is too much...&quot;  At that point I realized that that was a taste of what an autistic person goes through when he is unable to process all the stimulation he is getting.  This is what I mean by the writing was an integral part of the telling of the story.  It helped craft the story.  The pace and manner put the reader in the autistic's mind for short moment.  I do not know if there is a better way to create a better empathy with an autistic person.  In this way this book is pure genius.<br />The novel also shows the pressures put on a family attempting to raise an autistic child.  In this case, it pulls the family asunder, adding more conflict to the story line.<br />I strongly recommend this book.  It gives a revealing view of autism as well as being entertaining.  This is not a &quot;cause&quot; book, but one that reveals autism whileit entertains.	2004-03-22
US	51152027	R2ZANM91PT83P3	1573222453	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Great Book	Compelling.  Gripping. Riveting.  All those cliche adjectives that get plastered on book jackets actually apply to this absolutely terrific book.    It is the saga that follows Amir, an Afghani, starting in his teens years in Afghanistan, through his years in the US after fleeing from the Russian occupation and then his return when the Taliban are in power.      That is merely the setting, however, that gives the book a unique flavor.  This is not just an Afghani historical novel.  It is a compelling story of Amir's relationships with his best friend/servant, his father and those around them.  The first person narrative delves deeply into those relationships and his own inner feelings, fears and insecurities.  Eventually he overcomes a crisis of guilt, but not without much internal and external struggle.    It is difficult to describe this book without making it sound like a psycho-drama.  I do not want to give the plot lines away.  It is far from that.  There are some brutal scenes and brutally honest scenes.  The author gives the reader the essence of Afghanistan in the seventies before decades of war, the flavor of the Afghani refugee community in the US and lastly, Afghanistan under the Taliban.  But the heart of the book is the narrator's personal struggles.    I believe The Kite Runner will last as a classic for years and years.  The writing is terrific, the story gripping, compelling, riveting (and all those other jacket cover adjectives).  I can not recommend this book highly enough.    This is by far the best Afghan book out since Afghanistan became a popular subject.  It is far superior to Winter in Kandahar and Bookseller in Kabul.      Since reading it I have recommended this to several very diverse people.  Every one has loved it.	2004-03-17

His personality quirks and love of food only get more entertaining with each book rather than tiresome.  This character carries the book.<br />Of course, there is a mystery.  Like Terra Cotta Dog, there are actually two mysteries the good inspector solves.  One - a seemingly straightforward murder - is obvious and he solves it almost as an afterthought.  The other - involving government intrigue - is much deeper and difficult to solve.  Camilleri coordinates and intertwines the two story lines marvelously.<br />The writing is consistently good, the mysteries interesting and you can not help but like Inspector Montalbano.  This is a winning combination.  This is billed as a series of Inspector Montalbano mysteries.  However it is not essential to have read the preceding books.  This book is recommended for an enjoyable mystery romp through Sicily.	2004-03-15

A reader will laugh out loud one chapter and be in tears the next. It is a love story that endures the tragedies of the second world war and subsequent Greek civil war. Sited on the Greek island of Cephalonica, the author points a sympathetic eye towards the Italians forced to war, and an unsympathetic eye towards the Germans and communist Greeks. It is a viewpoint still held by many Greeks who lived through the era.  <br />The characters - both main and ancillary are rich and unforgettable.  <br />The image of the elderly lovers riding into the sunset will stay with the reader always. A truly wonderful book!  I do not see how a movie could live up to images and character depictions deBerniere's brings to this novel.  <br />A word of caution to those who may have read this author's other books.  Corelli's Mandolin is nothing like his South AMerican fantasy trilogy - it is much better.  I highly recommend this book.  It is humorous and poignant with a touch of historical fiction thrown in for good measure.	2004-03-09

Rarely is tenseness sustained page after page as it is in this book.<br />Charles Schine, the main character - an advertising executive - recounts how his life becomes completely dismantled - derailed.  A series of awful incidents compound each other after an entertaining flirtation/affair.  The horrible incidents, which are caused by Charles' own actions, are played out against a background of depressing family news that are not of his making.  He gradually loses control of both his out-of-home downfall and in-home downfall.<br />Page after page, chapter after chapter, Charles is beaten down withouot respite.  The reader finds himself almost cringing with the turn of every page because he knows things are only going to get worse.  He can not help but root and root hard for Charles.<br />The format adds to the overall sense as well.  There are a few short chapters inserted that are entitled &quot;Attica&quot; and pertain to a teacher in the NY State prison.  These chapters bring the book togather at the end.<br />Perhaps the best part of this book is that at every turn the reader is with that most intriguing question: &quot;What would I do?&quot;  Most often the answer is the same as that of Charles, making the reader connect and become invested in Charles' plight.<br />The plot takes some absolutely wonderful twists. A review is made difficult because to give away one element may leave to a giveaway of another.  The writing is very good.  The book moves at a tremendous pace aided by the constant tightening tension.  This is a terrific read.  Entertaining and clever in all its twists and turns.  Throughout the book the reader is constantly faced with that most intriguing question: &quot;What would I do?&quot;  Often the answer	2004-03-07

Those who would criticize it as anecdotal need only look at the extensive notes.<br />Much of this book a reader would already have surmised from observing fast food joints - under paid workers with high turnover, fat content of food, etc.  However, Mr. Schlosser adds the facts and shows that its even worse than one would have thought.<br />More of this book is probably new to the reader (it was to me).  The author goes into great depth about the new huge agribusinesses, how they are controlled and how they control the market, governmental agencies and politicians.  Our  meat producers are reaching trust proportions and are abusing their power as the old trusts did at the turn of the twentieth century.<br />Frankly the book is quite depressing, and I'm not sure how savory I will find ground beef and hamburgers from now on.  The epilogue and the afterword holds out some hope though.  McD's has been making some responsible choices and it holds more sway in the industry than our federal and state agencies.  Countering that optimism, however, is the recent incident of mad cow disease. Mr. Schlosser addressed mad cow in the European context, but before the incident occurred in this country.<br />At times, the author is a bit alarmist.  If one figured the odds of the \\"super e coli\\" infecting someone in such a manner as to make him sick, using the author's percentages, one would see just how threatening it is - or rather is not.<br />A major criticism I had of the author's style is that at times Schlosser beat the proverbial dead horse and then beat it again.<br />Overall, the book was interesting, very very informative and well worth reading.	2004-03-03

Akunin's next book will not be out until April 27!!<br />This is a terrific book by an author who has evidently been selling huge numbers outside of this country for years.  It is easy to see why.  <br />Winter Queen is the first in the series that follows Erast Fandoring a very young policement in 1880's Moscow.  The writing is very good (as is assumedly the translation) and the author captures the main character's youthful exuberance wonderfully.  There is a certain innocence and humor underlying the writing that is very entertaining.  <br />Through luck and youth's belief in infallibility and immortality, Fandorin stumbles into discovering an international plot.  It is a typically good mystery as the plot winds into this conspiracy.  Mr. Akunin then rewards the reader by making the primary culprit pretty obvious -- but then it blows the reader out of the water with an amazing ending.<br />It was impossible not to like the main character.  The villains are an interesting lot.  The plot is very good with the absolutely great ending.  The place and times of the setting add to the book as well.  I defy anyone who likes mysteries to read this one and not get excited about getting his hands on Mr. Akunin's next one.  It promises to be an extremely entertaining series.	2004-02-26
US	51152027	R19WHZXK7ANS2L	1400030382	321194841	The Piano Tuner	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Difficult to Categorize	If I were to give a three word description of this book it might be Shangi-La meets reality.  It is the story of a British piano tuner who is sent to Burma to tune a piano of a British Army surgeon.  The surgeon is either idolized or reviled as the Brits attempt to completely colonize Burma.  The tuner is convinced that since the surgeon wanted a piano in the jungle and then wanted it tuned, he wants to make peace through music rather than force.  The tuner's idealism has a focus and that idealistic view carries through his Burmese experience.<br />The book traces the tuner's trip and then his experiences with the doctor.  There is more description than plot.  The writing is best described as elegant, and the author captures his character's rapture at the country and its people.  The descriptions of both are terrific and the historical references are informative.  The reader also gets an interesting primer on piano tuning.<br />The tuner himself is a shy innocent easily taken in by Burma and several of the people he meets.  He believes he has found his Shangri-La.  The book seems to float with him through his travels and interaction with the piano.<br />There is an undercurrent throughout of intrigue that wraps up nicely in the end.<br />One criticism I had is that there are a few instances where the character may or may not have dreamt a sequence.  I do not think the author had to leave those sequences up in the air.  He is adept enough to have carried them through either way or at least identified them as dreams or reality.<br />As noted, the writing is elegant and at times almost dreamy (which makes those few possible dream sequences more frustrating).  Combined with the author's unique ability at description this book will be one long-remembered for the writing, if not for the plot.	2004-02-20

Although it is not essential to have read Cannery Row before Sweet Thursday, it certainly helps.  Sweet Thursday carries on the stories of the misfits of Cannery Row and their unceasing cause of paying Doc back for all the good he has done the misfits' community.<br />This sequel takes place after World War II.  A few characters are vets, one was lost in teh war and the canneries have closed.  The main characters return in full favor and flavor.<br />This is a rarity for Steinbeck - a humorous love story.  The characters, as always, are interesting and very engaging.  The wit and wisdom of the unemployed men and brothel denizens keep the pages turning.  A new store owner, a visiting professor and a new &quot;hustling&quot; lady are added to the cast of the previous book. With every page there is a smile a bit of thought-provoking philosophizing.<br />A wonderfully entertaining book.	2004-02-18

Unfortunately, the book was way too full.  There easily could have been two books made of what is packed into this novel.  There are two major threads with several sidelights thrown in as well.<br />The first portion is mostly introductory and plods.  The narrator hero then finally gets on the scent of one of the killers he is out to find and the story flows very well.  The plot then moves from New York to New Orleans and again the reader is subjected to some plodding introductory information and some sidelights that seem superfluous.  The New Orleans portion dragged again until the narrator is directly on the scent.<br />Another weak point is that the real killer was pretty obvious - or at least easy to guess at.<br />All that having been said, Mr. Connolly is a terrific writer and the writing keeps the reader in the book through the times it gets bogged down.<br />This book was recommended to me by a friend with the cautionary words that all of his books are not this gory and the others are better as the character develops.  A warning - this is very gory, it is nearly impossible to keep count of how many gruesome murders are described in this book.<br />I reluctantly recommend this book.  The two plots are good, even though so unrelated they probably should have been in two books.  The writing, as I've noted is very good.  The narrator character seems as if he could be interesting if and when developed more.  The writing and character is enough for me to read Mr. Connolly's next books since I've been told this is the foundation to better enjoy the others.	2004-02-12

Unfortunately, he is not one of the better story-tellers.<br />Once again set in Albany, this novel goes back into the 1880's to begin.  We see young versions of some of the characters to arrive in Kennedy's other books.  Unlike most of his other novels, politics and bootlegging do not play a big role.<br />The book starts as a love story between a young Irish man with some education and a beautiful upper crust old money girl.  The characters are engaging, the writing wonderful and the dialogue terrific.<br />The novel then begins to go off the deep end.  It seemed to me to cry out for an editor.  Suddenly it became non-lineal without reason.  Nor did the non-lineal aspect add a thing to it - it only made the plot difficult to follow.<br />By the end there has been a love triangle (told in snippets of retrospective) and a murder-suicide.  As the main character/narrative slips into depression after the beautiful wife has died in a fire ending her life of quasi-madness he turns into crime solver and seeks retribution.  If you had difficulty following that recap of the last fifth of the book, imagine when it is spread over 40 pages.<br />Kennedy's writing is superb.  Unfortunately after the first half I began to hurry to the end.  By the last portion I was shaking my head in wonderment that such a fine writer could have told a story so poorly.	2004-02-04

Like others in this series, Dortmunder goes to commit a burglary, it gets bungled and Dortmunder, with his incredible genius, not only gets the burglary right, but a whole lot more.<br />The humor in the book is hilarious in some areas, cumbersome in others (there are conversations by the regulars in a saloon that are always on the hilarious side).  <br />I find some of Dortmunder's sidekicks to be cartoon-like characters.  Unfortunately for this novel, the cartooning goes beyond the characters and into the very thread of the mystery/thriller.  Dortmunder and his crew have to swipe the femur from an obscure saint so that one even more obscure fourth world nation can get into the UN rather than another.<br />The engineering of Dortmunder's revenge against those who mucked up his original burglery is ingenious and makes the book.<br />This is fine airplane or beach reading.  You won't be a better person for reading it, but you will have some laughs.  Depending on your sense of humor, you may have many laughs.	2004-02-04

He captures so well the characters and the times in which they live.  The characters - both main three-four and the supporting cast jump out of the pages at the reader.  (He reminds me of a German Steinbeck in the way he able to portray characters.)  As the three friends plod on fighting to live well and happily in a depressed economy and a depressing time, one finds himself rooting them on.<br />Somehow, Remarque makes the reader have complete empathy with characters - even though we are now eighty plus years away from when they lived.

Inspector Montalbano is at times a curmudgeon, a sweet tender man, a genius, a bumbler in news conferences and a man with a sense of humor and of himself.  Other characters in the book - the good guys and the bad guys are equally engaging.  This was my fiorst Inspector Montalbano book and I will be rushing to read more.<br />There are two plot lines that are intertwined.  One is current - gun-smuggling tipped off by a mafia boss who turns himself in (only with a fake arrest, however).  The other is fifty year mystery that is unveiled only after the gun running is revealed.  Although this book is airy and at times humorous, the mystery that is solved is done so in an ingenious, yet believable manner.  The Inspector is terrific at deduction and, like other fine mysteries, one can read along and keep up with the unraveling of the yarn.<br />The writing is terrific.  This is a mystery that is intellectually challenging but keeps a smile on the face of the reader.  Inspector Montalbano does not take himself overly seriously and the author invites the reader to take him in the same vein.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for good writing and a good mystery.  If you like Italy and Sicily it will be even more engaging.	2004-01-20

At times the author jumps decades, even a century into the future.  It took me a while to warm to the style, but not only does it work, it is the way one person would tell the a story about another person: &quot;He did this and this. Little did we know that he would become a ...&quot;  <br />There are few authors who can portray characters as well as Mr. Jones.  I would put him in Steinbeck's class.  The reader gets to know all the characters in this book well.  At first, I thought Mr. Jones was merely introducing the people who populate this book (and there is a significant population of characters).  I then realized that this was what the book was all about - the lives of these people in Madison County Virginia.  And what interesting lives they were. <br />The central theme is slave-owning blacks.  The slave-owners, white and black, are followed as are free blacks and free whites.  At the center is the plantation and its denizens of a slave-owning black named Henry.  He was bought out of slavery as a boy by his father who now disapproves of his son's holding slaves.  When Henry dies, his widow tries unsuccessfully to hold the plantation together with what she perceives is the benevolence that would allow her to follow her husband to heaven.  Heaven accepted benevolent slave-owners.  One ned not free his slaves to get through the Pearly Gates. It should be noted that some of the descriptions of this book portray the central theme as this disintegration.  However, it comes near at the end of the book and is almost an afterthought.<br />The heart of this book is the tenuous intertwining of whites and blacks in the ante-bellum south.  Rather than the usual handling of these tensions, this book adds the compelling component of blacks owning blacks.  This addition of a fourth class of southern citizen after rich whites, poor whites and slaves enriches this book and makes it a five star read.  The rich characterportraits carry the story-line rather than vice versa.<br />I strongly recommend this book.  It was wonderfully written, the characters hauntingly unforgettable and the topic a little known one that is compelling.	2004-01-20
US	51152027	R38LFTPCNYAOAE	0140177388	713608567	Cannery Row	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The Players Tell the Story	At the outset of this book, Steinbeck tells the reader that the only way for the story of Cannery Row to be told is to let the characters tell it.  That is exactly what Steinbeck does and he does it with his usual genious.<br />The characters of Cannery Row are brilliantly portrayed by Steinbeck.  He is in his element writing about the survivors in the lower echelon income brackets.  Without the reader realizing it, in addition to the brilliant portraits of the characters, there is also a story being told.  The down-and-out want to do something &quot;nice&quot; for Doc - the research scientist who is everyone's friend, mentor, doctor, banker, etc.  The first attempt is an abysmal failuer.  So might the second be characterized, except it is just what Doc was expecting - what he was not expecting was his enjoyment of the failure.<br />Cannery Row is on par with Steinbeck's other fine works.  His characters are, as usual, unforgettable.  Although the story-line does not have a lot of depth, it is the vehicle to get to know the characters.  The characters are the star of this work.  I strongly recommend it.	2004-01-20

Little of this book is devoted to facts about the Express.  That is appropriate, because as Mr. Corbett proves beyond doubt, there are not that many facts to be known.  There is, however, legend and buncum.<br />Mr. Corbett devotes most of the book to the buncum (a word he aptly uses often) and the legends.  He then debunks them with proofs that have been well-researched.  He also gives interesting profiles of the &quot;journalists&quot; and dime novel writers who both made up stories out of whole cloth and created legends out of men such as Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill Hickock.<br />Some of the writer/character profiles are priceless.  They could be characters in spoof novels.  So are the men who attempted to establish their bona fides as riders for the Express - often getting years and places absolutely incorrect.  The most hilarious was a man named Murphy touted by no less than the NY Times as the last of the Pony Express riders when he died in the late 20th century.<br />Mr. Corbett does a very good job at giving all that is known and can be proven to be true about the Pony Express.  He then also does an excellent job tracing the inaccuracies as presented in histories of the Express.  Lastly, he traces the origins of the legends that grew long after the Express had ridden its last ride.  An entertaining and informative book about an interesting topic.	2004-01-13

They actually only meet a few times.<br />The theme of the book is the renewal and regeneration of these characters; one through her work and one through an affair with a much younger woman he knows he will never keep for good.<br />The strength of the book is the fine writing and the character development.  The most interesting character, however, was a gardener, Peter, who worked as an assistant to the sculptress and wrote disturbing prose on the side.  He was the only character with any tension or mystery.<br />The disappointing aspect of the book was that Peter was the only really interesting character.  The others were likeable enough, but not gripping.  There were some nice small insights into sculpture and experiences as a war correspondent in places like Bosnia.  Unfortunately there was not enough tension or conflict among the main characters to really keep the readers interest at a high level.  There were other characters brought in who never really enhanced the story.<br />Not a bad read, especially since the writing was so good.  Unfortunately, the story-line lacked depth, tension, conflict or mystery.	2004-01-08

This book is little better than the one he wrote about Christmas and WWI.  <br />This book traces Washington's journey from West Point, through New York City, Philadelphia, Wilmington and Annapolis to Mont Vernon.  It is filled with tedious toasts and responses, and accounts of his going-away parties.  Many of these are in the difficult to read spelling and syntax of the times.  There are also countless repititive cites of comparisons made of Washington to Cincinnatus.  <br />I found the writing disjointed.  Often I had to go back to see who was being quoted and in what context.  Mr. Weintraub would leave the narrative of the farewell trip to make historical references without setting or foundation.  In perhaps the most telling historical reference, he carried on about how Christmas was not really a big deal in 1783 - despite the title and his oft-repeated assertion (without foundation I might add) that Washington wanted to be home for Christmas.  <br />Equally disappointing was the short shrift given to Washington's actual farewell and resignation before Congress.  It was given a scant few pages whereas the account of Washington's fetes in NYC went on and on interminably.<br />There really is not much to this book beyond the fairly obvious points that Washington was extremely popular and his return to civilian status was impressive and noteworthy.  Perhaps the best allusion in the book was the quote by the imprisoned Napoleon that &quot;they wanted me to be a Washington&quot;.<br />I wish I had skipped this book.  The only knowledge it imparted was Washington was wined and dined from West point to Annapolis as he bid farewell to public life.  It could have been a good 12 page magazine article.	2003-12-29

It should be at least 259 pages shorter.<br />The author fills the pages with irrelevancies, speculation and thesis-like sociological postulations.  <br />This book is ostensibly about the murder of a prostitute in the 1830's and the trial of the man accused.  Why then must we be subjected to several pages on the following topic: the family history of the man who hired Helen Jewitt to work as a servant before she moved to Portland then to Boston then to NYC?  If that were not enough in the irrelevant department, we also got some information on this man's grandfather's competitor in the general store business nearly a century before the events in the book.  These irrelevant facts added nothing to the book.<br />Added to this frustration were page upon page of the auhor's speculation about events unknown and motives of people long gone.  She gets more out of an undated letter than anyone I ever knew.<br />Lastly, are the author's often redundant postulations and theorizing about the socialogy of the age. Some would have been helpful, but by the fourth or fifth time the same theory was repeated it was decidedly tiresome.<br />It is a shame this book was not cut and cut again.  The story is a good one and the points the author made were good.  It was the presentation and the stretching as if she felt compelled to write  400 page book rather than a short concise one that ruined the experience.  You could read the first chapter, then skip @150 pages to the account of the trial and hardly miss a beat.	2003-12-22

No one could capture the personalities of characters as well as Steinbeck and this is one of the best examples.  He uses the breakdown of a bus and then an ill-fated bus trip to bring a disparate group together.<br />There's a half Mexican driver/mechanic, his acne inflicted young helper, his wife the depressed cafe manager and the Hollywood dreamer waitress who populate the bus station-cafe where most of the book transpires.<br />Added to these are a successful businessman, his frigid controlling wife and their college sexual daughter, a stripper, a salesman and a complaining curmudgeon.<br />Only Steinbeck could flesh out their portraits so well and make their interactions so believable.  Every character is a comment on a group or facet of America a few years after WWII.  However, all the characters and their representative groups could be put into today's society.  That is why this book ages so very well.<br />The writing is a joy to read.  The descriptions are so good you can see every character as if you were in the cafe or on the bus.  I will also go so far as to say there is a little bit of every character - good and bad - in each of us, which makes them all so familiar.<br />I strongly recommend this book.  It is a wonderful piece of American writing and it portrays a truly realistic slice of Americana.	2003-12-10

A few years ago, I thought the series got stale and stopped reading them.  This book was a pleasnat surprise because it was as sharp and fresh as the early Parker/Spenser mysteries.  The characters have again begun to evolve and have some depth.  Back Story has a better than usual plot which brings it to the four star level.<br />Spenser is asked to solve a 28 year old murder and bank heist(for the fee of 6 Krispy Kreme donuts).  Hawk is in on the action early and Susan is always there as well - as well as a new Pearl. Spenser has to go back to the hippy/radical world of the early seventies and the question and investigate the players who have now grown to middle age.  The plot has some clever twists and interesting characters woven in to give it depth.  The mobsters are in on action to add the requisite danger and intrigue.<br />I recommend this to any Spenser fan as the best in the series in a while.  It was good to enjoy these characters once again after a hiatus.  I recommend it to any mystery fan who enjoys witty dialogue and excellent repartee among characters.	2003-12-02

I had read Flag of Our Fathers by Mr. Brady and truly enjoyed it; but, that book was partially about his father and I was afraid he would not be able to carry through on another book.  I was thrilled that my apprehension was misplaced.<br />This is a terrific book.  Mr. Brady uses the story of eight aviators shot down over an island called Chicha Jimo (neighbor to Iwo Jima) as the thread that holds the book together.  Fortunately, the book is far more than that.  <br />Mr. Brady gives a thumbnail history of Japan for the 250 years preceding Pearl Harbor.  With that history he explains the evolution (devolution?) of that country's thinking about colonization (why can't it do in China what the European powers were doing all through Asia?), the Kamikaze military and honor system and then the bastardization of that system.<br />He is even-handed in his relating Japan's history as well as our own hypocrisies in the waging of the war.  Although he points out our short-comings, he by no means takes the revisionists' side in the anti-atomic and anti-American strategy debate.  <br />He also provides the history of aviation in American military history starting with Billy Mitchell's extremely accurate predictions on air dominance and its ability to ruin Japan.  As he follows the air war in the Pacific, he provides great insight with amazing supporting statistics about the effectiveness of our air power in the that theatre.  He also includes surprising insight to our aviation losses.<br />I could not put this book down.  It is readable, although graphic at times.  Mr. Brady effectively uses the thread of the eight downed flyboys to tell the story of aviation in the Pacific theatre which is nicely set up by Japn's history leading to the war.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-11-26

It tells the story through the eyes of an American raised in Japan who grew up fraternizing with artists/pornographers/actresses and came to run a nightclub.  The plot weaves back and forth from his youth, ostensibly &quot;formative years&quot; and December 5-6, 1941.<br />I found that the flashbacks did not add much to the book.  It only showed that every urban center has a seedy side.  So also his girlfriend added nothing to the book except for an unlikeable character and a relationship that had all the warmth of an ice cube tray.<br />The last stage of the book has some action and is far less stagnant than the first two thirds.  As the attack on Pearl Harbor nears, his protection from the higher ups for whom he had done work, begins to falter.  He also has to escape from his nemesis - a blood thirsty killer who had made his mark in the Rape of China.<br />The book was filled with details that did nothing to move it along.  The main character was interesting, the rest seemed like cardboard cut-outs.  All-in-all the cultural aspects were fairly interesting and the last portion's action and intrigue lifted this to a three star.  I give it only a lukewarm recommendation.	2003-11-25

Parker does smart tough guy dialogue as well as anyone.  Spenser's self-deprecating humor always rings true.<br />So why only three stars?  There is nothing to distinguish this book from any of the other Spenser novels.  The plot was fairly good, but so are all of the books in this series.  It is -as are all the Spenser novels - goos light reading.	2003-11-17

I doubt it is possible to cram any more information into 470 or so pages.  In college I took a course entitled &quot;Physics for Poets.&quot;  This is a sceince book with the same intent - science for the non-scientific.  It covers everything from the history of the universe to atom construction to the history of living things to human development, etc., etc.<br />I found the book inconsistent.  The first third is a history of scientific discovery.  On top of telling the story, Mr. Bryson adds amusing anecdotal information about nearly every scientist named.  At times these digressions got too far off point and I found I had to go back to remind myself of the topic being covered.  Very often, Mr. Bryson would spend an inordinate amount of time describing scientific theories that were proven false.  Occasionally these were interesting.  Many times, however, I felt they were added only for humorous effect and did not add to the book.<BR> <BR>Later in the book, it is straight science.  Perhaps it is my liberal arts bent, but I found much of this to be tedious.  <br />This book is hard work.  It began as history and ended as dry, often complex science.  <br />The best part of the book is that it relates how little we actually do know about our world, its history, atomic structure, and really every scientific field.  The title perhaps should have been &quot;The More we Know Tells Us How Much We Don't Know.&quot;  That is the best lesson learned from getting through Mr. Bryson's epic tome.	2003-11-17

Purchase was a &quot;steal&quot; perpetrated during the Jefferson administration, that Bonaparte needed the money, that Lewis and Clark explored the territory and Jefferson skirted the Constitution to make the deal.<br />This book tells in very readable prose all that you probably did not know beyond that skeletal history - like the Lewis and Clark mission started as a military reconnoiter and only later turned into a scientific one.<br />Mr. Fleming takes the reader into the palace and diplomatic intrigues of France, Spain and England to tell us how the purchase really came about.  He includes the bribes and backdoor dealings emanating from Paris and how they were understood or misunderstood in America.  Mr. Fleming also portrays well the fledging politics and &quot;spinning&quot; in the new UNited States. Included are the views of the naysayers on both sides of the ocean in all four countries as well.<br />This is well-written and interesting throughout.  Fleming's short descriptioins of each major character are brief but very concise.  There is not a wasted word in the book.  I strongly recommend it to anyone with even a passing history of the United States.	2003-11-03

He has an uncanny insight into his own insanity (as he refers to it).  Many of the character's infatuations were reminiscent of a pubescent teenager's.  His analysis of the \\"relationship\\" he was fostering with a real estate agent he never met but had seen was humorous.<br />I did not find the character very likeable.  He was not sympathetic in any way and frankly, I got tired of his rantings.  Nor did I find the book hilarious as the reviews had promised.  Several of the scenes resonated with Steve Martin's comedic voice and I could imagine him playing the part.  This was what made Shopgirl so incredible - it was well-written and you could not imagine it was Mr. Martin doing the writing.  This book seemed like more of a screenplay than a novel.<br />The ending was pure Hollywood; again making it seem more a screenplay than a novel.  After loving Shopgirl, this was a huge letdown.  The writing is still good and that is what got it to a three star rating.  I can not whole-heartedly recommend this book as I can Shopgirl.	2003-10-30

The way they played their roles - as well as blackjack - was entertaining as well as a testament to their talents.<br />I expected and got a fairly captivating account of these MIT nerds taking on the casinos.  What I did not expect, and what made this book a five star from a four was the mysterious ending.  From a straight-forward account it turns into a riveting page turner I could not put down.  Strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys gambling, casinos, David and Goliath yarns or just plain good reading.	2003-10-28

It started well then slipped into some bizarre fantasy.  Originally it captured well the youth of a boy in 1960, but then it went over the edge. <br />The second story is an interesting tale of the awakening of a college freshman in 1968.  The next two stories (progressively shorter) deal with two veterans from the neighborhood of the boy (who tangentially come in contact with the college freshmen).<br />The four stories all have a girl in common.  She is never a main character, but is always around the periphery.  The last story is a feeble attempt to bring all five together that again bumps up against the fantasy.  <br />The reason this book gets three stars is that the writing is good and I thought two of the stories were good, one fair and two weak.  TO be honest, I do not enjoy fantasy/sci fi, maybe those who do would not be so put off by those aspects.	2003-10-10

Not only did I not like them, but it is obvious that neither likes him/herself and during much of the book each other.  The characters are girl and boyfriend.  She gets pregnant, they break up, he insists he wants to marry her, she insists on going home (why is never clear to her or to a reader) and he insists on taking her.  On the way they get married and talk and talk and think and think.<br />There are many books that are enhanced by characters who are not likeable.  This, however, is not one.  The author goes back and forth from one to the other telling the story.  They do not only tell the story, however.  The reader is treated to their inner-most thoughts and dime store psychoanalysis of themselves, the other one and any other person who happens into the book.  <br />This constant analysis gets tedious to say the least.  Not only is it tedious, it does not fit the characters.  The male, for instance can hardly string a sentence together - at one point he uses the word &quot;perturbed&quot; hoping he used it correctly - yet his thoughts are filled with what we are to believe are intellectual insights and deep analysis.  Frankly, the characters were too dumb for the thoughts the author was putting into their heads.<br />I always shudder when I hear someone say: &quot;I'm the type of person who...&quot; because most of the time they are the furthest thing from that type of person.  This book was page after page of that same type of high-brow psycho-analysis.  Mr. Hawke may be a great actor and may have been jilted out of an Oscar, but as an author I put him in the so-so range and would not recommend this book.	2003-10-01

It is better than good for several reasons.<br />First, it is novel in that it describes the first voyage beyond the histroy we get in grade school.  It describes Columbus' luck as well as his skill which when combined enabled him to make the journey and how he kept the crew thinking that land was always just over the horizon.  He establishes every sailor of the time knew the world was round - the fear was the unknown size of the sphere and what lay beyond the horizon.<br />Next, it describes Columbus' next three voyages.  I had seen maps showing them, but never read any accounts.<br />Perhaps the most interesting part of the book, though, was Mr. Least-Moon's accounts of how Columbus treated and perceived what he named Indians.  The author puts these acts and attitudes into the context of the impending slaughter by the Spaniards of the Indians in the name of Christianity.  The most remarkable aspect of the author's accounts and comments is that he makes the observations without a hint of political correctness or bias.  His nearly emotionless rendition makes the reader's own conclusions more poignant. <br />This book is a terrific historical account of events about which most of us only have a superficial knowledge.  It is strongly recommended.	2003-10-01

He would be terribly angered that Hemingway would grab a bottle of whiskey, walk up to his writer's garrett and whip out a novel.<br />My impression after reading this Heminngway work is that he did just that - grabbed a bottle of whiskey and whipped out a novel.  The parts of the books are headed as seasons in Harry Morgan's life and much of the book that is devoted to him is okay.  He is Florida Keys boat owner trying to get by with money-making trips - both legal and illegal - between Florida and Cuba.  However, especially near the end, there are other characters brought in who have absolutely no relation to the book.  The impression the reader gets is that these characters and their descriptioons were sitting on Hemingway's desk and he threw them in as filler.  Most annoying were a series of character descriptions of people on yachts in a yacht club when the Coast Guard was towing in a boat - completely useless to the book.  A freshman in college may cite them as some examples of class disparity, but I think that is giving too much credit.<br />Unless you are completely enamored by Hemingway, I'd skip this one.  Frankly, if it weren't by Hemingway I doubt it would have ever been reprinted - if printed at all.	2003-09-24

I do not think I needed to read its predecessors (although there were a few vague references to Bosch's prior problems with the police brass).<br />I found this to be a pretty run-of-the mill detective story.  The characters were good, the writing fine and the police procedures interesting when analyzing 25 year old human bones.  I thought the plot was going very well - including a few erroneous leads being followed.  However, the ending left me disappointed.  In the last 75 pages, one suspect is arrested, then the charges dropped and then the real killer identified and the crime solved.  After such a long set-up it concluded too fast and in an unsatisfying manner.<br />I enjoyed the book, but I did not find anything in it to recommend it over other detective stories.  It was solid but no more.  If you are a fan of this genre, I think you will be amused but not ready to rush out a buy some more Bosch books.	2003-09-22

The story is fast-paced, the characters likeable.  <br />My difficulty with the book is that the reader has to suspend reality.  The militia is too powerful; the &quot;star&quot; character's father (who really is the star character in this novel) is too good or too lucky (In one place he is able to plant a bug in a completely ridiculously lucky set circumstances.); and, the twists in the story-line are never quite believeable.  The man is also immediately taken in as a blood brother by this super-careful super-paranoid group.  Also, the killing of the main character's fiance at the outset is absolutely superfluous to the story - although it was a good way to hook me into the book.<br />If you can suspend reality it is okay beach reading.  If you can't, it is a trumped up mystery where the author pulls all the strings to make the story work.<br />Although this novel can be read in a matter of hours, there are other better ways to spend that reading time.	2003-09-22
US	51152027	R1HHNXCV1SQ5UV	0440237238	201563244	The Edge of Justice	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Good Page Turner	This is a good page turner of a mystery.  The plot is a good tight mystery with some great twists and turns.  The leading man - an agent with the Wyoming AG's office that investigates politically sensitive cases - is compelling and sympathetic.  He battles his own demons as he battles the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  Woven throughout are his rock-climbing trips up the sides of mountains that add a different ingredient to the tale.  The other characters - a wheezing, possibly dying boss; a near love-interest reporter; a group of on the edge rock climbers (and two clearly over the edge) and the ambitious up-and-coming politico-prosecutor - are all good and add to the book.  The best supporting cast member may be Oso, Agent Burns' bear-like dog.<br />My primary criticism of this book is the super-human physicality of the main character.  During the several days and nights this novel takes place, he is beaten severely more than a few times.  Twice he ends up in a hospital room.  Despite the beatings and lack of sleep, he not only keeps on ticking, but rock-climbs mountains in bad weather and at night that he would advise against doing in daylight.  The credibility of this part of the book is diminished more as Burns constantly reminds us that he has not climbed in eighteen months.<br />The author also bails the hero out a few times with the near miraculous appearance of the county's only good cop - who happens to be a mountain of a man in a mountaineering novel - and Burns' brother, whose appearance on the scene is even more improbable.<br />I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.  The above criticisms bring it from a 4 star to a 3 - but it is still enjoyable.  The character is likeable so I expect to pick up the prequel which has been published.	2003-09-08

It was a huge industry producing millions of dollars a year and employing thousands (many on a seasonal basis), yet because it was not taxed there is very little hard data.  Moreover, ice appears to have been a primarily American love in the last century.  Only after WWII did the rest of the world pick up our affinity for cold drinks and food.  These perspectives make the book more than a biography or &quot;how they done it&quot; book and makes it worth reading.<br />Although I thought the book weakened towards the end (as if he was looking to fill a few more pages) it was a joy to read.  Gavin made the history of a unique industry into a good story.	2003-09-04

Worse, Abbey takes shortcuts.  For instance:  all the old characters are brought back; all meet Hayduke again who asks for their help; all refuse and then suddenly, without explanation, all are on board to help him destroy the huge earth-mover, GOLIATH.  The object of their sabotage and the fact that they are back together is very predictable.<br />Also, the final scene of destruction is disappointing.  It too, &quot;just happens&quot;.<br />The message is still great.  The cast of characters still appealingly eccentric, Hayduke still a demi-god, but it does not come near to the overall excellence of The Monkey Wrench Gang.  Due to the shortcuts, I would strongly recommend not reading this book unless you've read Monkey Wrench.  Even then, you better have really loved Monkey Wrench and want some more of the same.	2003-09-03

Mush of the story was kept classified until the last few years (although the author never tells us why or when it was declassified). Unfortunately, the book is poorly organized.  <br />The author also gets bogged down in minutae which often is not relevant to the story or just plain uninteresting.  The book is at its best when it steps back and looks at the big picture of this small company or is describing the methodology it used. Those parts are too thin in the book.<br />Also, the author tries to walk the tightrope of relating a very specialized aspect of the US Army in WWII while at the same time attempting to put that small aspect into the overall.  Thus the reader gets two sentence analyses of major events, which are often insultingly simplistic.  One would expect that if a reader is going to pick up this book devoted to one company, he would know the general aspects of the war.<br />Many of the characters are compelling as are the battles (for lack of a better word for the activities of deception troops) in which they contributed.  The technology is also interesting.  I think this would have been a much better book had it been 100 pages shorter.  <br />It also could have been improved if the author did not gush so over Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  The amount of space devoted to him in the opening chapter is disproportionate to the role this Navy man in the US Army deception comapny.  An example of the author's obsession with Fairbanks and the unorganized nature of this book is seen when, in the middle of a long chapter on the deception techniques the company is using France on its way to Germany, the author breaks in with a two page update on what Fairbanks was doing at the time -- in the Mediterranean and in the Navy and nothing to do with deception!!! Nothing at all to do with what was going on in the 75 pages before and after.  A glaring example of the superfluous anddisorganization running through the book.<br />I wish I could recommend this because of teh great accomplishments of those described in this book.  Unfortunately, it is a long hard journey to get from beginning to end.	2003-08-23

He discovers that they are contolling an entire island population for their own nefarious designs and comes to the rescue of the backward islanders.<br />The Love Nun has hilarity and off-beat humor but not much else.  The plot in and of itself was so goofy as to aid the unfortunately shallow humor.  This book is good for laughs, but not much else.	2003-08-21

This sequel is no where close - not even mildly enjoyable.<br />Three Musketeers is filled with action, laugh out loud humor and intrigue.  This, its sequel, is filled with mind-numbing palace and political intrigue that is not very intriguing. <br />The only part that was mildly interesting was how the four characters turned out after twenty years.  There is also an intriguing descendant of deWinter, but his role is only sporadic.<br />When I think of the original Three Musketeers fondly, I am sure I will have long forgotten this long interminable book of palace political maneuverings.  If you loved the original and want to leave your recollection untainted - skip this one!	2003-08-20

Mr. Slack turns this bit of history into a thoroughly entertaining and informative book.  Of course, he had the whacky Charles Goodyear to help along the way.  To say Goodyear was obsessive would be to understate the case.<br />Mr. Slack weaves the efforts of Goodyear and his rivals to make rubber a useful commodity into a compelling read.  Goodyear's successful efforts - after years of amusing failures - are purloined along the way by a rogue's gallery of figures.  The title would imply a greater role for Hancock than he appeears in the book, but Mr. Slack shows his scientific methodology and buusiness sense in contrast to Goodyear's lack thereof to great effect.<br />As we watch Goodyear trip and fall repeatedly on his way to stumbling onto the answer, Mr. Slack explains the science behind the experiments well.  Adding to the book is Mr. Slack's ability to give the historical perspective.  He relates well the times and the burgeoning industrial age, so that when the answer to production of rubber is found, its impact on the age is comprehended by the reader.<br />A terrific and well-written history.   Strongly recommended.	2003-08-20

Its primary sources are  Franklin's voluminous writing and the letters and writings of his contemporaries.  Mr. Isaacson added some pertinent observationss by historians. The mix makes for not only interesting and well-researched reading, but entertaining reading as well.  <br />Mr. Isaacson ties his themes (or theories) of Franklin from the begginning to the end.  Thus one can see characteristics of the man that started in his youth and carried through to old age sometimes with no or minor changes, a few times with significant metamorphes.  The end result is that the biography flows naturally.<br />The author also used well chapter and sub-chapter delineations which aid the reader throughout.<br />The perspective is a unique one.  Therefore if you have read another Franklin biography, do not hesitate to pick this one up.  It is strongly recommended for both those who are familliar with the man and those who know little of Franklin.	2003-08-01

Hardly a page was turned where I did not learn something.  One of the biggest mysteries about this book is where does the non-fiction end and the fiction begin.<br />This is a wonderful mystery centered around the old faithful hunt for the holy grail.  But this takes the grail to several new levels - what it is, who is keeping(?) it and what it means in history and especially to the Christian church.<br />The plot twists and turns just as any reader of the mystery gendre would like.  But there were several things that made the twists and turn special.  Good guys turned into bad guys and visa versa and seemingly tangential characters end up playing major roles.  The reader can also work on solving the main question - where is the grail? - since he gets the facts the same time as the main characters (what he does not get is all the background maneuverings).  Also some of the clues I was actually able to get before the main characters.  Lastly, this is the kind of mystery that I particularly enjoy - although one of the characters is a professor so he knows an inordinate amount about the subject matter - the main characters are regular humans with no superhuman qualities.  Everything they do is believable.<br />This book held me in its grasp tighter than any I have read in a long time - it is the kind of book you wish you could just sit and read without interruption.	2003-07-20
US	51152027	R2CH95UYZ1KGXQ	0525947299	468712802	No Second Chance	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Another Coben Hit	This is a mystery/thriller at which Coben excels.  It begins with the murder and near murder of the main character -a plastic surgeon.  At the same time, his 6 month old daughter is abducted.  Predictably, he becomes the main suspect.  However, The search for the girl goes on for more than eighteen months.<br />Most of the main characters are introduced early on, although how they will interact is not known for quite some time.  The solving of the mystery is kept from the reader until the very end - another Coben trait.  Also like Coben's other stand-alone books, there are dark and twisted characters.  <br />For readers who enjoyed Coben's other works, there is virtually no humor in this work although there is the obligatory Batman TV show reference.  The main character is not very likable, but the plot carries the reader despite a lack of warmth to the father/surgeon who lost his daughter.  Many of the other characters are very likeable and all are believable, including the doctor.  I think the reason the main character was not more likeable was he was an egomaniacla plastic surgeon (which may be redundant).<br />This is a very good beach read.  You may not be a better person for having read, but you'll have a good time while you're turning the pages.	2003-07-20

First, this biography is well-researched and well-written.  Mr. Thomas was particularly adept at describing the battle scenes and was careful to site more than Jones' as a source for his depictions.<br />What truly added to this biography was that Mr. Thomas made no effort to &quot;gild the lily&quot; that was John Paul Jones.  He depicts him as he probably was - a pretty unlikeable, womanizing, whiny, glory-seeking martinet who eventually wore out his friends with his complaints and pleas for a fleet.<br />If there is a criticism of this book, it would be that the recitation of Jones' whinings get repetitive and somewhat tedious - but - that is exactly how they must have seemed to those who through the years tried to help him since they all abandaned him in the end.<br />Mr. Thomas effectively shows both sides of Jones who today would have been on mega doses of Zoloft (at least).  At the same time he was pestering the powers that be for ships and complaining about favoritism (that was not shown his way), Jones was making observations, predictions and suggestions about an American Navy that were prescient and obviously knowledgeable.<br />This was a very good and non-biased biography.  If there were one thing I came away with from the book, it was that in the end - through no fault of his own - John Paul Jones did not really do much &quot;on paper.&quot;  One great battle and a few good skirmishes.  However, by bringing the Revolution to Britain's doorstep his victory(ies) had a huge psychological effect on Britain - a nautical terrorism if you will.  Mr. Thomas does well to put Mr. jones in true perspective - both his deeds and his legend.	2003-07-15

Unlike the prior books, this one takes place in Los Angeles rather than Rome.  The change in venue does not detract.<br />The Bernini Bust is one of the more enjoyable of the series.  <BR>Is there a bust or not?  Is it a forgery or not?  At least the reader is sure there was a murder early on in this thoroughly enjoyable novel.<br />Mr. Pears' all-to-human heroes go through their usual mistakes and miscues and end up solving the crime.  There is also a bit of shaving the ethical edges that always adds an interesting twist or two to these books.<br />What adds to this series is that Mr. Pears keeps the characters - and their relationship - developing.  He also adds humor - one can imagine that when Mr. Pears writes about Argyll and Flavia he does so with a wry grin.<br />There's no heavy-lifting in these books, but this book, like the others is a great light, quick read.	2003-06-30

This detailed history gives us that history.<br />More than a book about a &quot;war&quot;, or rather America's largest covert operation ever, this is a book that chronicles the congressional machinations and maneuvering of one congressman who made sure he was on the committee that counted - the appropriations committee.  <br />Mr. Cline relates how this liberal democratic communist hating congressman from eastern Texas - Charlie Wilson - fell in love with the mujahideen and the Afghan cause after the Soviet invasion.  In this incredibly detailed chronicle, Mr. Clive tells how he began his mission with the power of the purse without a realistic game plan.  Then how a &quot;black sheep&quot; CIA operations officer bought into the war and began to focus the money and energy.  Ultimately, a young operative came on board who put the proper strategy in place to truly take on the Soviets and, not only bleed them, but beat them.<br />Cline has done incredible research.  The book is filled with detail that is at times amusing, interesting, fascinating, ironic, historically fascinating and then, just plain head-shaking.  One of the best aspects of the book is that Clive interviewed many of the amazing cast of characters after the events had completely unfolded.  He added their restrospective perspective on some of the events which added perspective.<br />This book is a well-told account of a part of our history not only unknown to the American public, but also obviously unknown to most of the Congressmen who voted to fund the &quot;war&quot; to the tune of billions of dollars.  It is also the story of some VERY unique renegade characters who pull off this huge covert war.  It is clear that the million and billions put into the war was orchestrated by two to three men.<br />When I started this review I had pegged this for four stars.  As I wrote, I changed it to five.  The history and characters are so amazing and Mr. Clive relates it all so well that it has to be five.<br />The epilogue is disturbing as it looks at the support of the Afghanis in the light of post 9/11 - probably a subject worthy of another book.  But knowing now the history of our support for the mujhahideen against the Soviets, I feel Mr Clive has given me a better understanding of Afghanistan's (and Islam's) role in the world and America's place in it for the last twenty-five years.  This is an important book, well-written and amusing to boot.	2003-06-27

It has a fascinating murder plot line that follows Dante's work (the murders are staged as re-enactments of portions of Dante's hell), terrific personality profiles of Boston's literary geniuses of the nineteenth century and captures much of the forgotten aspects of the post-Civil War.  <br />So why only two stars?<br />The writing.  It is uneven throughout and frequently cumbersome.  The first third of the book - or canticle as the author calls it - drags interminably.  What took 150 pages should have taken thirty to sixty.  The author retells so much in different ways in this part of the book that it is near insulting to the reader.<br />The last two canticles are better but still a task to get through.  Not only is there repetition but there are many superfluous and meaningless asides in the plot.  For instance there were several pages devoted to an instance of sexual harassment in the workplace.  Not only was this a bit of marginally believable gratuitous political correctness, but it added absolutely nothing to the story line or character development.<br />The book is a true disappointment.  If written well it would have been an intriguing Richard Patterson meets Longfellow and friends.  As it was written, it was a long and arduous journey suffered to get a few pearls which mostly surrounded the character portraits of Longfellow, Holmes, et al.	2003-06-26

Perhaps the writer's view of his \\"return to Batavia\\" is skewed by the fact that he still does not live in Batavia, but a neighboring town.<br />Of all the characters in the book, only Rep. Conable and the author's father are not ripped (one way or the other).  At least the author does not spare himself from the same tone and negativity.<br />There is nothing interesting about the book.  You can read (over and over) about the urban renewal mall that replaced the old buildings in downtown Batavia.  But the author just does not make the reader care (or sympathize) about it.  He does nothing to make you want to know anything about Batavia, nor is there anything else to make you read this book (from beginning to end).<br />Even the writing is difficult to follow.  It is choppy and filled with references that a) do not matter; and b) are so obscure you would need a reference library to keep track (of them).<br />About the only thing the author accomplishes (in the book) is to persuade the reader that upstate New York really has not contributed much in the literary and arts fields.  This book did not improve that woeful record he portrays.<br />(Oh, by the way...if these parenthetical references drove you nuts, do not even open this book.  I have never seen so many parentheses in a book.  Not only are parenthetical references multiple sentences, there are entire paragraphs  so enclosed.)<br />Dispatches from the MuckDog Dispatch is simply a dog of a book.	2003-06-05

For me, this is by far his best.  A story of an elderly fisherman who catches his greatest fish after days of bone-wearying battle only to lose it to sharks.<br />One can see so much in the book - winning/losing, catching dreams/losing dreams, dreams not living up to expectations - if one wants to go the literature class route.<br />Or, one can just savor the language and the human angst so wonderfully portrayed.  I felt I was in the boat with the old man and when he was talking to himself, he was talking to me.  Plainly, a terrific book.<br />One other note.  Years ago I listened to this book on tape.  Although not as good as reading it (obviously), it is a good book to listen to on tape.	2003-05-28

Gordon relates this story well from the pie in the sky innocent dreaming of those who first promoted the idea, to the amateurish first attempts to finally, the professional successful laying of the cable. He is concise and interesting.  The book is filled with contemporaneous quotes from pro-techies and and anti-techies of the time.  <br />I enjoyed the &quot;big picture&quot; better.  Gordon relates well the era of the early industrial age when fortunes were seemingly made in minutes and Americans and Englishmen thought anything possible.  He conveys to the reader the huge leaps and bounds made in technology during the first half of the nineteenth century and uses the laying of the Atlantic cable as not only a shining example of such advances, but also a crowning achievement of the age.<br />The book is as readable a history as one will ever find.  Gordon takes his subject, puts it in perspective and sprinkles the book with off-topic history that aids in the telling of his story.	2003-05-28

There is actually more about geology that stone walls themselves, although the author tried mightily to write a few hundred pages about them.  <br />The geology and history is well-written and interesting.  I learned quite about when walls were generally built and how the stones came to be that comprised them.  However, the last third or so of the book - that part devoted to the walls themselves was often redundant.  It seemed the author was searching for words to fill the pages and stretching - like the last pages of a term paper you know should be eight pages but you have to make the assigned ten pages.<br />A chapter on builders and technique would have been more useful than the stretched parts.<br />There are pearls of interesting history and I am not sorry I read the book.

I kept wishing for more.<br />The mystery plot did not have much in it and was summed up in about a page at the end by the narrator/main character.<br />The main character/narrator has Tourette's syndrom.  This was a great idea full of potential.  Unfortunately, soon into the book this became an impediment.  As obsessive and compulsive are the sufferers of the syndrome, so was this author in describing the syndrome.  Page after page, time after time, the narrator would launch into the effects of the syndrome.  It got tedious, interrupted the flow of the story and, after the first several passages, did not add to knowledge about the syndrome.  These descriptive passages added nothing to plot nor the character.<br />On the positive side, the main character shows that Tourette's does not make the sufferer less intelligent.  He does solve the mystery.  There is some good writing, unfortunately it was interrupted as I described above.  I did learn something about Tourette's (it just did not have to be repeated).  <br />In sum, I feel the author missed hitting the mark in his use of the Tourette's.  The character was neither amusing nor sympathetic and after teh pounding of the explanatory passages, got plain tiresome.	2003-05-23

His syntax is not common and his descriptive sentences and passages are often over-written.  This was particularly true for the first third to half of this book.  I felt the second half was much more clearnly written and less cumbersome - fewer times did I have to go back and reread a sentence to figure its meaning.<br />Mr. Lent's characters in this book are far stronger than in In the Fall.  Blood and Sally, the two main characters are strong, unique and haunting.  Lent draws the reader into their growing relationship using their pasts effectively to explain their present personalities. These characters were the best part of the book.  My major criticism of Lent's main characters is they are prescient beyond believability.<br />The plot line is very good until the end when it gets a bit hokey to fit with the rest of the hard-bitten story-line.  The epilogue is useless and I could not figure out why it was included.  It did nothing to add to the book.<br />This is not a book to read if you are looking for a sunshine view of humanity or the world.  It does paint a good picture of an area in the wilds where people settled because they had a past they were not to be asked about - a seedy side of America's wilderness where people settled for reasons other than arable land or good climate.  The characters in this book will stay with me for a long time.  Unfortunately, I found it a task to plod through too many parts of it to rate it higher.	2003-05-13

A fan of Buckley's novels with Blackford Oakes as the CIA agent involved in international crises, I looked forward to this historical novel.  I was sorely disappointed.<br />Buckley's main character is flat.  The conflict he will face is apparent and obvious early.  The &quot;big twist&quot; at the end was predictable and meager.<br />Worse, I was never sure if Buckley knew what he wanted to write.  A novel about a participant in the trials? A novel with a philosophical debate?  An expose on the legal tenets used in the Nuremburg trials?  Unfortunately, all of these were touched upon in the book, but none satisfactorily probed or developed in depth.  Instead, the book was scattered and disorganized with the reader left to want more in each area.<br />Overall a very disappointing book about a topic that has so much to offer.	2003-05-07

The series need not be read in order as I found when I read this one out of order.  <br />Pears' ironic humor is abundant and his main characters all so human.  The cultural aspects always add to the plot and Pears' writing style also adds.<br />The plot of Titian Committee is good.  The author presents the reader with members of a research committee who are all - at some time or other - suspects, prime suspects or murder victims.<br />Like some of Pears' other books, there is a moral decision/question that throws an extra twist.  Are the good guys always good?  Or is it good to be a good guy and not so good?  <br />Somehow the reader gets the warm feeling throughout this book that Mr. Pears writes with a constant grin on his face.  This is an enjoyable light read.	2003-04-17
US	51152027	R2ROE4MB002NTF	0446611921	269463589	The Millionaires	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very Good Thriller	This is a thoroughly entertaining thriller in an area seldom plowed by mystery/thriller writers - high finance banking. Don't let that put you off, it is merely the setting for the thrills to follow. The writing is fast-paced and switches from first person to third. However, the switches fit and keep the book moving. The plot twists and turns and has all the surprises one would want from this genre.<br />Another point I appreciate is that the two main characters - two brothers with \\"normal\\" strengths and weaknesses - do well against a cast of \\"bad guys.\\" What makes this work for me is that they do nothing super human or out of the realm of possibilities given their talents (and weaknesses) unlike, say, Grisham's characters who always outrun and out think the professional killers.<br />This is great entertainment. It won't make you a better person, but you sure will have fun reading it. I had difficulty putting it down. I will move on to Meltzer's others.	2003-04-14

It is poorly written and is bad history.<br />When the author stops digressing, he has many unimportant and trivial anecdotes about the dollar in American history.<br />His interpretation of American history is terrible.  Just a few examples:  Early in the book he cited Hawthorne, Thoreau and Twain (who lost a fortune trying to be an industrialist) to reach the conclusion that Americans did not collect and hoard money in the nineteenth century.  Apparently he did not read the rest of his book which went on ad nauseum about Americans in the nineteenth century chasing and counterfeiting the dollar.  In another instance he concludes that all civil rights were suspended during the civil war (not that this had anything to do with $) - completely ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Lincoln's attempt to suspend habeas corpus.  Lastly (I could go on and on), he finished the book by noting that on our dollar bills are the icons that were present at the birth of our nation.  This, after telling how Grant and Cleveland were on our bills!  Last I looked they lived late in the next century.<br />I kept hoping that some pearls about the dollar would come shining through.  Whatever pearls there might have been were muddied by his erroneous history and his horrible interpretations of the history he included.  <br />I felt I wasted a good deal of time reading this book.  If one wants to read the only useful part of this book, limit yourself to the chapter(s) describing the private banknotes.  Nothing before or after is at all worthwhile.	2003-04-09

As I have written in other reviews, after the reading the first couple hundred pages of Instance of the Fingerpost, I bought the first three books of this series.  The first, The Raphael Affair, was very good and I was looking forward to the series.  The next, Giotto's Hand was a disappointment, due to a lack of development in the main characters and a disappointing plot.<br />This book restores all my faith in Mr. Pears.  The main characters, Flavia and Argyll, develope and become a bit more human than in Giotto.  The plot is terrific.  As usual for the series the art world and culture are wonderfully portrayed and add depth and color to the book.  A bit of history is thrown in to add even more to this novel.<br />Both Flavia and Argyll are truly likeable characters (they got lost Giotto) and investigate the art and the art crime in their usual different ways.  This dichotomy works well.  One is seeking the policeman's answers, the other the scholar's.  When they come together, it forces the reader to smile and wonder.<br />You need not have read both the prior books in the series to enjoy this one; however, I would recommend reading Giotto's Hand first, since one of the protaganists comes from that book.  Knowing her and her prior escapades would certainly help.	2003-03-27

This was another typically strong effort.  Although you need not have read prior books in the series, it would not hurt to know the characters.  The author does ot leave his characters stagnant but continues to make them grow so you feel you know them personally.<br />In Elvis Cole, Crais somehow combines the hard-boiled LA private eye of the old-time genre with a character who possesses sympathy and a sense of humor.  All his characters are believable.  With the exception of his partner, Pike, there are never any superhuman efforts.<br />In Indigo Slam, Crais has woven a terrific plot with twists that just keep coming.  Not only does the mystery plot twist and turn, but so do the characters.  Until the very end, the reader never really knows about either the plot nor the characters.  <br />If you are an ardent reader of this series (as I am), you will be pleased to know that this is one of the better ones.  If you have never read the series, be ready for some very enjoyable mystery reading.	2003-03-27

I thoroughly enjoyed the first, The Raphael Affair; however, this was a step down.<br />The two main characters, Flavia and Argyll, did not seem to progress from the earlier book and actually seemed somewhat flat. Too much of the book was driven by Flavia's boss's bureaucratic battles and intrigues. The plot was okay, a bit hokey.<br />Still, the cultural setting was very good and lifted the book from mere ordinariness.<br />Although not as good as the first in the series, I will read some more...I think the potential is still there and I still want to like the two main characters as much as I did in the first book. Besides, the art world scene as portrayed is interesting enough to bring me back. Also Pears writing is good. All in all, this was an amusing fairly light read.	2003-03-26

I can not help but think it could have been and should have been better.<br />The book follows two and a half themes - the building of the Chicago's great fair, the Columbus Exposition, a serial murderer named (alias) Holmes and the half theme, another murderer named Pendergrast.  <br />Although the Pendergrast theme is the least of the three (only about 25 pages devoted to it) it was the most gripping.<br />Larsen's account of the fair itself is, as one might expect, extremely well-researched.  However, the telling is filled with redundancies.  There were probably as many pages devoted to the landscape artist Olmstead's physical maladies as there were to Pendergrast's madness.  By the end of this book, you will surely know he suffered from insomnia, toothache, etc.  Mr. Larsen must tell it six or eight times.  More space was devoted to building delays and weather induced problems than in descriptions of what actually was built.  Since there are a dirth of photos of the architectural wonders Larsen wants the reader to appreciate, this was a short-coming.  The book devotes more to the problems of building than the end result.<br />The story of Holmes' murders never grips the reader as it should.  Possibly because there are few firm facts.  Mr. Larsen acknowledges this in his Notes and Sources at the end of the book.  Holmes is an interesting story unto himself and Larsen does well to try and weave him into the fair story.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of hard facts, the story of the killer never raises the tension as one might think.<br />Mr. Larsen's emphases just seemed to be misplaced making what could have been a riveting read a somewhat tediously plodding one.	2003-03-19

This book can be looked at as either an historical piece about the war in Afghanistan or a Special Forces propaganda piece written by Mr. Moore who is unabashedly, unashamedly and unapologetically a major booster of the green berets.<br />The distinction is needless, as the historical account of what the green berets accomplished in that war naturally extols their virtues as amazing fighting men.<br />The first 50 pages grabbed me unlike any other historical account I can recall.  It read like an exciting war novel.  The book bogged down a tad as each special forces team's campaign was related.  Several were so similar I am not sure why they were accounted for separately except that Mr. Moore wanted to give all the credit where it was due.<br />Beyond the straight historical account, this book presented a valuable and thought-provoking look at special forces' type of unconventional warfare versus conventional warfare.  I do not think Mr. Moore will be invited to Gen. Tommie Franks' house for dinner very soon as he repeatedly rips the general for old-fashioned bureaucratic laden warfare strategy.<br />That Mr. Moore knows his subject is obvious.  What warms the historical account is that he also knows the people involved.  The added personal descriptions and anecdotes added much to the book. <br />As we approach a war in Iraq, this book left me with mixed feelings about our prospects there.  On the one hand, a reader could only have confidence in our fighting men and women if the special forces \\"dogs of war\\" are let loose.  On the other hand, one is left to wonder about the effectiveness of our conventional forces. As Mr. Moore extolled the virtue of the special forces in Afghanistan and pointed out the short-comings of the conventional forces there - including how they screwed up (I cleaned up Mr. Moore's language there) the only operation in which they participated, I wished he addressed where - if anywhere -he thought the more conventional forces would be an asset.<br />This book is a wonderful account of truly great American warriors, a thoroughly entertaining read and more thought-provoking than one would have thought at the outset.  I strongly recommend it.	2003-03-10

I was not disappointed.<BR> <BR>There are three elements of this novel I found strong.  First, the three main characters.  They are likeable with endearing foibles.  Argyll is a loveable bumbling genius type; Flavia the beautiful, smart, action person who isn't quite as smart as she thinks she is; and the General, the affable smarter-than-he-looks detail man.  I look forward to joining them in future escapades.<br />Second, I found the mystery to be a good one.  There were good twists and turns and the final twist was a dandy.  There are no superheroes here which I think always enhances a mystery.  <br />Third, the cultural aspect.  I enjoy a novel, whether a mystery or otherwise, that resides in an area of knowledge obviously known to the author but different from my experiences.  It is obvious that Mr. Pears knows art and the art world (including the criminal aspects).  He uses this expertise to enhance the plot and add depth to it without &quot;showing off&quot; and making the reader feel like a dunce.<br />This was a thoroughly enjoyable mystery placed in the middle of the art world.  I will continue on this series - joyfully.	2003-02-25

The book is, as one would expect, extremely well-written.  The author's self-effacing and engaging style that works so well on TV works equally well as he tells his stories.<BR>The book is a newsman's view of the news he reported.  <br />Most impressively, Mr. Schieffer walks that thin line of relating recent history to give enough background without insulting the reader's intelligence by treating him as if he has been living in a shell for the last 35 years or so.<br />This is a typical memoir in that it relates Mr. Schieffer's professional career.  The subtitle - &quot;What I Couldn't Tell you on TV&quot; is unfortunate, however, because there are not really any secrets in the book.  This is a memoir and not a &quot;tell-all&quot;.  I do not think this author would be amenable to tablois style tell-all yarns.  That does not detract from the book, only makes the title a bit misleading.<br />Mr. Schieffer has reported and/or been close to most of the major stories in America for the last few decades.  This is an enjoyable look at those stories through his eyes which had a close-up view.  The writing is as good as the view he gives the reader.	2003-02-21

The tail end includes the the three years covered by Gospels.<br />This book is humorous.  Some of the humor is clever, some is very clever and some is sophomoric (although still funny).  What made me enjoy this book more, however, were the correlations Moore drew between eastern religions - Confuciousism, Hindu, Buddhism, etc. and Christian thinking through the teachings of Jesus.  It gave the book depth beyond the giggles and guffaws.<br />His interpretation of the portions of Jesus' life that were related in the Gospels were clever, still humorous and thought-provoking.  Through the humor and philosophy there was a poignancy to his three main characters that will stick with me for a long time.  There is the lost and unsure Jesus trying to figure out how to be a Messiah, the thoughtful and loving Mary of Magdalene and Biff, the wise-cracking inventor of sarcasm who is truly devoted to his best friend who happens to be the Messiah. The afterword is worth reading, esp[ecially as it pertains to Mary of Magdalene for whom the author- and Biff -ahs an obvious affection.<br />My initial impression of this book was that it was going to be a light tromping through some humorous and absurd situations.  It quickly developed a depth that made the humor secondary to the characters and the theme.  I will look for more books by Moore.	2003-02-16

In reality, it is in three parts:  When the narrator is 12-14 years old, when he is just out of college at age 24, and a decade later.  The part told by the youthful Ned is more than half the book.<br />The characters are all introduced by the teenager.  As he tells the story, the characters are like cut-out cardboard figures.  This is true even of his father who is the main character and motivator behind the telling of the story.  Although one would not expect a 12 year old to depict characters with depth and sympathy, the voice telling the story was ot that of a twelve year, thus the incongruity.  This was a major disappointment to a reader who found the characters to be the best part of \\"Empire Falls.\\"  The disappointment was so deep that I almost put the book down for good.<br />When the narrator leaves college and heads back home to Mohawk and renews his relationship with his alcoholic father the entire book turns around.  Suddenly the characters have some depth so there can be empathy with them - particularly the father.<br />When  Ned resumes the story ten years later, the characters have been completely fleshed out and the relationship between father and son is completely compelling.  At that point I did not want to see the story end, but knew that if it had been lengthened it would have been cheapened.<br />This novel depicting the relationship between a dysfunctional (and somewhat bizarre) father and his son finally became gripping.  There is some humor to the book as you would expect from Russo.  However, the characters are so down in the dumps it rarely reaches the light-hearted nature of his books.<br />Although  \\"Risk Pool\\" is not nearly as good as \\"Empire Falls\\" due to its major problem getting the reader to know and sympathize with its characters, I was glad I stuck with it to get to the narrator's adult years.  The last third of the book lifted it from a two star to a four star.	2003-02-10

Add to this that only one, the last, has access to most of the facts, and the tale told four times is wonderfully intriguing.  Mr. Pears also captures well the narrators' personalities in the tone of their &quot;manuscripts&quot;.<br />The first portion I found spell-binding (I rushed to get more books by Pears while in the middle).  Not only did the story grip me, but I thoroughly enjoyed the references to the medical practices of the 1660's.<br />The next two portions almost drove me mad.  The story got lost in long-winded philosophical and religious sermons.  These two narrators lay out political plots, counterplots and espionage so complex that the story line became muddled.  I actually wished at one point I had kept notes to keep it all straight.  By that time, however, I was wondering if I would finish the book.<br />The last portion was almost as great as the first and tied all four manuscripts together with a knot tied with a terrific twist.<br />This novel was the equivalent of four books written about the same instance.  Two were terrific, two were not.  Some of the history was a welcome treat, other parts of the history supplied - especially all the political intrigue - needed more explanation unless you are well-familiar with this period of English history. I am sure a devoted Anglophile would love every bit of this book. <br />All in all I am glad I suffered through the two middle narratives to reach the end.  I was sorely disappointed those two did not reach the high standards of the first and fourth.	2003-01-28

I am not surprised Hollywood embraced it - I am surprised it took so long (he author is no slouch at self-promotion).  The book read like a bad movie in the sense that I had to constantly remind myself that it was non-fiction.  The story is captivating.  A nervy, overly mature teen fakes his way into Pan Am cockpits to get free rides and fake paychecks.  He scams everyone from a French printer, to judges to patients and other doctors in a hospital.  His exploits were amazing and humorous - hubris such as his has to be humorous.<br />The story line (I'm not sure an autobiography can have such a thing, but this one seems to) is terrifically entertaining.  The only thing that holds it back from a five star rating is the writing was merely adequate.<br />I don't know how the movie will be, but I definitely enjoyed the book.

He said to make sure I started with &quot;A&quot; which I have now done.  The book is okay - just okay.<br />The plot was good.  Written in the classic private eye mystery manner, the plot twists and turns as one would like.<br />However, while I was reading it and enjoying it to some extent - but not a great extent - I was trying to figure out why I like Block's, Crais' and Coben's books better.  I realized it was because I did not particularly like Kinsey Milhone.  She does not have a sense of humor and seems negative about a lot of things in life - having children, dogs, etc.  She was not a character I had any particular desire to get to know nor with whom I had any great desire to spend time.<br />Since this series is so popular, I can only imagine that Ms Grafton fleshes her out better in up-coming books.

The premise is a good one.  Unfortunately, Mr. Lehrer goes no where with it.<br />This book really contains very little.  Very little history, very little mystery, very little archeology, very little forensics - well, you get it.<br />The story line could have been good if fleshed out more.  The author spends way too much time recounting his hero's imaginings of the battle at Antietam Creek.  There was also much redundancy in the recountings of the battles.<br />Lastly, the last chapter containing a modern day murder is completely incongruous and superfluous.<br />This is a book to skip.  I was hoping for some interesting insights into the battle or some in depth accounts on the archeology.  The book delivers neither.  It is mostly an ode to the Civil War by the main character, a National Park Archeologist, who apparently wishes he was there.	2003-01-04

A middle-aged couple is murdered and left on an isolated beach.<br />Mr. Crace's writing occasionally approaches blue prose, occasionally poetry.  But it has an intensity all its own.  A reader will never forget the haunting description of the murdered bodies' decomposition.  Nor will the reader forget the individual's personalities - the little they are revealed.  One can just imagine the man's excitement the morning of his death as he planned and orchestrated a romantic day with his long-time and uninterested wife.<br />This book is unlike any other I have read as it starts with the murder then jumps between subsequent events (such as decomposition on an empty beach and then daughter's learning of the death, etc.) in chronological order and then back to what happened to the couple the day of the murder in reverse chronology.  It all really comes together when the couples' estranged daughter enters the mix.<br />I recommend this book; but do not expect light beach reading.  It has an intensity that kept me rapt.	2003-01-02

One sees the difficulties both in expanding environmental conservation as well as the pitfalls and errors made in the area (with all good intent) since the forties when Leopald wrote.<br />Interestingly, especially to me as someone who hunts, much is written in the context of hunting.  He also has some insightful words about why people do hunt as a connection to nature.  As only a hunter can, he identifies the hunter's reverance for the land and nature.<br />Portions of this were assigned when I was in college. Now, 28 years later, the entirety means much more. It should be required reading for everyone, especially lovers of the outdoors.	2002-12-11

The author obviously did his homework with hundreds of quotes and references.  The book was so detailed as to occasionally lose the reader.  A map certainly would have helped.  I got the feeling that every single guerrilla attack was accounted for in this book.<br />On the strong side were some amusing and touching accounts of individuals and incidents.  On the weak side was the page after page of oh-so-so similar accounts of attacks.  The book also centered on the Virginia area guerrillas with hardly a mention of those in Missouri and Kansas.<br />The author's theory, that the Civil War - or at least Lee's surrender - was delayed by at least months by the work of the guerrillas is well-substantiated in the book.  However, I think the author would have been better served to apend more time on the larger picture and overview and less time on every derailment on the B&amp;O Railroad.<br />Worth reading for a serious Civil War buff.  A bit too much for the casual reader of Civil War material.	2002-12-02

The narrator (later named Paul Watkins) weaves the stories of his three lives - East German soldier/spy in Afghanistan, spy in America and lover in America - into a quilt made up of wonerfully woven words and twisting plotlines.<br />From the first page, Watkins interjects a mysterious tensionthat trails through the book as is a constant undercurrent adding significantly to this yarn of a spy left in the cold when the Berlin Wall falls.<br />I strongly recommend all of Watkins.  This one should be one of the first and not to missed.	2002-11-17

I differ from one of the panning reviews in that I thought it was refreshingly not leftist liberal journalism. The author seemed to take a non-political view of the characters with an expected sympathetic eye towards the first ladies. I also found some factual discrepancies that a fact checker should have found which - as always - puts a cloud on the author's credibility; i.e.: Ford was an All-American center for Mich, not a star quarterback at Yale. But her countless quotes from insiders were well chosen, very informative and interesting. She did her homework on those. If there were half stars to give, I'd give this a three and one-half. Certainly worth the time.	2002-11-13

Minutae.  The last two chapters - regretably brief - gave a much better overview and analysis.  This book was a very detailed look at a limited area.  I would have appreciated a more worldly view and analysis rather than the details of the inner workings of Henry Morgenthau.  It was fairly interesting, but could have been better.	2002-11-11

The author interjects deep philosophocal soliloquies into the thoughts of a) an uneducated Vermont farmer folk, b)  a freed slave woman, c) a home school dropout bootlegger, etc. It is a shame the author went this route so often, for the story line and theme were excellent.

None of his books show off his talent as this one does.  It is the story of his life as an American schoolboy in England's swankiest schools.  More than that it is about a boy growing up adhering to rules and recognizing that that adherence is endemic to his English life but not his American life.<br />Best of all about this book, though, is the writing.

At the outset, he admits that his publisher recommended this topic to him. I suspect his publisher needed an Ambrose book on the shelves for the summer of 2000 and magde this suggestion in May of the same year.

The plot is good, but enhanced by the timeliness of the setting - Hussein's Iraq and UN involvement.  The characters - especially the bad guys are not very convincing.  <br />North's own involvement in the plot gives it a nice twist.  It also makes much of the background material more believable - one must imagine that Ollie knows much about his topic.  I actually thought the book was made more intriguing by deciphering North's barely hidden agendae.<br />Lastly, be prepared for, but not offended by, a few chapters of fundamentalist Christian proselytizing.  A bit more of North's agenda thrown into the mix.<br />All in all an amusing spy/thriller with good hard current events thrown in.  Worth the read.	2002-10-18

This may have been an experiment on the writer's part, or perhaps plain ego alone.  Either way, it failed miserably.<br />The jacket relates that the author was self-taught in the classics.  He decided to show off all he learned in grossly overwritten prose throughout two-thirds of the book.<br />The other third is written in gross language.  He makes himself the protagonist/hero, yet you never get to know what kind of man that character is - except ego driven in fiction as well.  <br />The plot had potential, as did the underlying theme of Dante's soul-searching and difficulties writing his classic.  None of it came off, however.<br />Perhaps the best part was a thirty page diatribe about the publishing industry.<br />If ever a book was \\"jus' showin' off\\" this was it.  I am sorry so much potential was wasted.	2002-10-14

Roscoe is number seven in what has moved from a trilogy to a &quot;series.&quot;  For me the series has gotten old.  More of the same characters, strange relationships, and unique writing.  If you like Kennedy's writing style and other books, there is no reason you would not like this one.  I, however, found this one to be a tired retread of the same formulae Kennedy used in his earlier works.<br />In Roscoe, the main character is another Albany pol who skirts the line between illegality and legality while fostering the political machine's criminal element.  The character is not very believable and certainly not sympathetic.  His relationships are even less believable.  <BR> <BR>I should have stopped with Ironweed.  I will not go back to numbers four through six of the series.	2002-09-30

He did not miss a beat after leaving Elvis Cole and Pike.  Gone is the humorous wise-cracking p.i.  This book centers around a tormented cop, loser small time thugs and big-time organized crime members.  There are as many, or more twists and turns as the Cole novels, but the characters leave their humor behind - there is no time for it in this tense hostage situation.<br />This book is set up in a unique manner.  The story progresses by the telling of several characters' points of view.  A few pages of Talley - the tormented cop; a few by one of the hostages; a few by one \\"bad guy\\" and a few by another \\"bad guy\\", etc.  Crais adroitly keeps the story moving fast in this manner.  More importantly - and impressively - he does not give the reader any tips even though both sides - or rather, all sides - of the story are told at once.  It only adds to the suspense of this thriller/mystery.<br />This book would have been a solid five star, but it seemed to drift a bit in the middle.  On the hand, you better have time to read the last fifty pages non-stop because you won't be able to put the book down.	2002-09-16

The author weaves into the history the mechanical progress of the times as well as the public's yearning to view automatons and to be bamboozled.  <br />The &quot;Turk&quot; had an interesting history unto itself which included meeting many important world figures during its long career, including Twain and Napoleon.<br />In addition to giving the reader what would be only a fairly interesting history, the author did not disclose how the Turk worked until the very end.  He shared the many theories posed and the debunking of them.  His self-control in holding back the secret kept reading the book as if it were an Ellery Queen novel rather than a piece of non-fiction.<br />The finishing touch was a chapter on a real chess-playing machine, Big Blue and its human opponent.<br />This was an interesting and thoroughly entertaining read.	2002-08-26

He also writes with amusing witticisms either voiced or thought by his first person narrator.  He also can weave a decent mystery.  This book contains all those qualitities.  <br />In addition to those qualities one expects from Mr. Demille, however, too much of the first half of this novel was a Vietnam travelogue - scenery, city life and growing economy.  Too much of the next thirty percent was a battle history of Vietnam (which was generally interesting).  Much of the rest was an up and down love affair.<br />In the too few pages where the mystery unfolded, Up Country was not up to Mr. Demille's high standards. (Out of the 704 pages, those pages may have totalled 100.)  I found the end result of the plot fairly predictable.  However, after the main character solved the mystery, his extraction from the resulting predicament was interesting.<br />All in all, too much up and down romance, landscape and weather description. The historical component may have enhanced the novel, but by the time I got there I was too impatient for something substantive to happen to move the book along.<br />Not a bad book, but I've come to expect much more (not in number of pages) from Mr. Demille.	2002-08-06
US	51152027	R3DB0N7ID8K5RK	0375726403	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Characters Make This Book	I was not a big fan of Russo after \\"Straight Man\\" where I thought much of the humor to be forced.  In Empire Falls, the humor takes a back seat - appropriately and fittingly - to the characters.  This is the kind of book where you get to know the characters so well that you will remember them a very long time, as if you had actually met them.<br />Set in a small dying, nearly dead, Maine mill town, the main character is a near college grad who returned to his hometown against his dying mother's wishes.  Many years after his return, it is apparent he thinks he is a step up on all the other town folk, yet he realizes he has been unable to achieve the one thing his mother lived for - to get him out of Empire.  The first and most obvious of many dilemmas he faces is how to make sure he gets his daughter out of town after high school.  This is especially poignant since he recognizes this is where he failed his own mother.  He recognizes what he believes is holding him in Empire, yet deep down he knows it (or rather she) should not be gripping him so. <br />Throughout the book he is constantly being cornered by people and situations.  He is a complex character made more so by his inability to face problems directly complicated by the confines of his Catholic upbringing.<br />This book rang true on almost all levels.  Russo threw in a bit of the absurd which made it more fun, yet interestingly no less believable.  It, and its characters will stick with you, and maybe even grow more on you, over time.	2002-07-30

The beginning captured me, the middle 300 pages nearly killed me.  The characters were unsympathetic and I found the story line inconsistent and filled with scenes that did not fit nor add to the book.  There is an entire segment where Kavalier is posted in Antarctica during WWII.  Although I could see how it might fit, overall this segment was incongruous.<BR>    <BR>After pages and pages of angst and emotion, suddenly something major would occur - usually something somewhat strange.  I think the author had a difficult time deciding whether he wanted to write fantasy or straight fiction.  Mr. Chabon also had an annoying habit of writing circuitously.  He would tell what had happened in about three sentences, then spend 35 pages re-telling it.  <br />In the uncertainty between fiction and fantasy I got to the point where I was happy to see Kavalier and Klay head off into the sunset.  The sunset they rode off into was as unnatural and unbelievable as most of the book.  With the exception of a few flurries of brilliant writing and the opening few chapters, I did not find this book worth the effort of over 600 pages.	2002-07-22

The author obviously researched this con and others well.  However, I found the book to be a bit thin.  If there was not more to flesh out the primary tale - and I doubt there were since the author clearly had read everything ever written on it -  then I wish Mr. Raynor had included more about the other cons he had researched.  Often he went to interviews of other confidence men to substantiate a point.  He easily could have added their tales to show just why the Drake Fortune con was so outrageous.<br />All in all though, worth the read.	2002-07-22

That washes away into a classic thriller involving all sorts of father son relationships that are unpredictable and, like true life, not easily explainable or pidgeon-holed.<br />What makes Coben so good - and he shined in this in Gone for Good (his latest novel) - is that his characters have far more depth than are usually exhibited in this genre.  He is so good at it that one wonders what Mr. Coben could accomplish in fiction other than thrillers.     <br />Darkest Fear shows Coben's maturity as a writer.  I strongly recommend all his Bolitar series and Gone for Good.	2002-06-25

I bought it on the basis of being a Pulitzer winner - oh well.<br />It could probably make some freshman lit student a good term paper to discuss American industrial ambition being primary over personal relationships, etc.  Unfortunately, a good prof would say that message was way to apparent.<br />The main character keeps building and building bigger and more unique hotels until finally things go awry.  One of the biggest problems I had with the book is there was page after page after page of lists of things Martin Dressler put into his hotels.  The author must have spent nights developing these lists - either that or tapped into a &quot;Disney's most outrageous rides ideas&quot; web site.<br />Some of the writing was interesting and as was much of the book.  It was just overdone.  I believe that was the author's intent to help drive home to the reader the grandiose ideas of his character.  However, it tended to get tedious.<br />A different book from the norm, I was not disappointed I took the time to read it.  I just would not have given it a big-time prize.	2002-06-20

The characters all, for the most part, come from one island, although there are appearances of others from a sister island.  Once you get used to the fact that not much is - or will happen -  the writing is good and the characters rather quirky.  The book - and its main character - only seem to progress in the last sixty pages or so.  Another reviewer is right on the mark when she said the book cover is misleading.  The blurb appears to be written by someone who never cracked the cover of the book.  Any similarity drawn between Stern Men and Shipping News is a tremendous disservice to the latter.  <br />Unfortunately, the good writing does not get this book out of the quagmire the author produces by making inbred characters with no place to go on these two isolated islands.	2002-06-17

(If you are not a Bolitar fan, keep reading.)<br />It is a unique tear-jerker of a mystery.  At some point, the main character's mother, old girlfriend and current girlfriend all die - two murdered one natural.  All are wrapped up in his brother's possible run from justice.  Like Coben's other novels, the plot twists and turns and takes the main character and the reader through the labyrinth together.  In this book, Mr. Coben piles on layers of emotions tied to the deaths, both violent and natural.<br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of this novel is that the main character can not and should not be referred to as the \\"hero.\\"  Unlike Grisham's novels where the amateurs always outsmart the professional killers, Will Klein is an admitted coward and keeps coming up on the short end of both the mental and physical battles he undertakes.<br />A great read.  Different enough from the Bolitar series that those who might not have loved that character (I am not one of them) will enjoy this book; the style abnd fine writing are similar enough that Coben's fans will continue to enjoy him.	2002-06-17

His background information, such as the life of an apothecary in the 17th century, was more interesting than the central story - the gory mutiny after the Batavia's shipwreck.  At least fifty per cent of the book is spent relating such background.  At times it was distractingly tedious (especially his relating of religious fanaticism in Holland), but overall it added depth to the book.  Since the plot line after the wreck is fairly thin - the thugs killed and then killed some more - Mr. Dash did well to make this into a full-length book.  If you enjoyed this book, you should definitely read Nathaniel's Nutmeg.  It is a more captivating history of this period.	2002-05-28

He drew several parallels between the Third Crusade and current times.  I was expecting great things to come.  The rest of the book, however, was just an adequate history.  If the quotes from bards, chroniclers and poets were removed, it would probably be 100 pages shorter.  Obviously well-researched, I found the historical part of the book to be rather thin.  Overall though, I found it worth reading.  The period is one colored in myth and legend.  The book cut through the fictionalized accounts.  Mr. Reston's honest assessment of the strengths andd weaknesses of his two heros - Richard and Saladin were interesting and worthwhile.	2002-05-13

This one did not.  Simply one of the best books I have ever read.<br />Watkins writes with a grueling sensitivity that is unparalleled.  He writes realistically of the hard, dirty, unrelentingly difficult life of a fisherman with a sensitive hand but without maudlin sympathy.  Watkins' succinct writing style adds to the tone.  You get to know his main character without really understanding him.  Indeed, it is clear he does not understand himself.  It would be unfair for the reader to do so.<br />A book of dreams clashing with reality - a place we have all been, especially when youth is meeting adulthood.

In fact at one point I thought it would be a much better book had he been the primary charcacter.  <br />As I neared the end of the book I came to this site to see if there was any historical basis to the book.  At first I was pleased to learn that it is based upon the lives of these two characters.  Then I became disappointed again.

I found it tedious.  The main character and his father were unsympathetic.  Mostly they left me flat.  His younger third grade sister had a genius all out of proportion with reality.  The first few pages captured me, the remainder left me difting.  The writing itself was terrific, but the characters and story line left much to be desired.	2002-04-15

Some parts extremely interesting - especially the portion on President Polk.  For instance the White House was considered completely public, so he had difficulty working.  Also, there was much insight into a little know president.  Other parts were tedious, such as the older ancestors.  All in all I thought it was an interesting way to portry history.  The author used an extremely interesting and accomplished family to walk us through the decades and centuries.	2002-04-13

The plot had the same twists and turns and the same main and entertaining characters.  The characters were only truly understood, however, if you had read Deal Breaker, Coben's first in the Bolitar series.  I also had the plot figured out about forty pages before Myron did (maybe I was lucky) which certainly did not happen in Deal Breaker.<BR>     The same sardonic wit was displayed throughout.  An very entertaining mystery.  I look forward to Mr. Coben's future Bolitar novels going back to the five star level though.	2002-04-08

At page thirty you have the entire story.  At page 38, I recall wondering what the remainder of the book was about.  The author had already described the Christmas truce at a few locations on the battle line and added that headquarters was not in favor of the temporary peace.  The remainder of the book is devoted to giving more and more examples of the same.  A nice magazine article, as a book it became tedious.	2002-04-02
US	51152027	R10X5IZSTC83LP	0440220440	971761343	Deal Breaker: The First Myron Bolitar Novel (Myron Bolitar Mysteries)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Great Start to a New (for me) Author	My son (age 13) and I listened to this on tape on a road trip.  We had trouble turning it off when the car stopped.  Although I had to remind him he was not to use the language - which was appropriate for the characters and not overdone - we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  He was not a mystery fan before this.  I believe he, like me, will want to read more Corben as soon as possible.<BR>    As other reviewers have said Corben is very similar to Parker (early stuff) and Crais.  Two leading heroes (?) and excellent mystery story lines.  Corben, like Dick Francis' racing based novels, centers his story in the world of sports and agents.  The setting gives it a uniqueness.<BR>    I strongly recommend this book for a totally enjoyable read.	2002-04-02

This book was a major disappointment.<br />When a person is playing tennis or squash, the worst thing he can do is think of two shots at once.  Invariably, he tries both at once and loses the point.  This is what Dunning did in this too long novel.  It is a novel about radio and a mystery novel.  In trying both &quot;shots&quot; at once, Dunning loses the point in a big way.  He should have chosen either and stuck with it.  The mystery never convincingly wove into the radio novel.<br />In Dunning's other works, he successfully uses his intimate knowledge of bookselling and journalism to enhance the mystery.  Here his radio marathon smothered a tenuous mystery plot.  Read his earlier novels, but skip this one for sure.	2002-03-06

Despite a slow spot in the middle when the main character goes out for a midnight stroll with her husband's soon to be exlaw partner, the book kept moving on the suspense built from a cat bite.  Fox captured the moment to moment inexplicable ups and downs of even a successful marriage.  Until I read this book, I thought they only happened to me! I strongly recommend this book.	2002-01-15
US	51152027	R2D80810QDG7RY	1569472564	120001981	The Vault	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Mediocre	This book just missed on any number of levels.  The Frankenstein references were tangential and never really wrapped into the story-line.  The character (admittedly this is my first Diamond book, so I do not have a history) never quite hits curmudgeon or genius - two character profiles for which I think the author was aiming.  The Times said this was an &quot;unguessable&quot; ending - I thought it was fairly obvious.  I would go with Block, Crais or early Parker any time.	2002-01-15

McNeal, however, weaves into the novel a group of characters each of whom is interesting in his or her right.  Each character experiences a metamorphosis that may or may not be expected.  I strongly recommend this book.	2002-01-04

He developes his characters as well so you get to know them and root for them. Elvis Cole - the main PI - has a sense of humor and irony.  Many scenes are laced with a wry comment and his own editorial comments on it.  Pike is similar to Hawk, but Cole eyes him with a speck of humor also.  Oh- and also - the mystery part is darn good too!  This was my first of Crais, I've read another, and am hooked.	2002-01-04

The author makes some good observations (with a decidedly liberal bend) but they did not warrant an entire book.  Sunday New York Times would have been a better placement.	2002-01-04

Requiem (Elvis Cole)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Come Back to This One	IF you have become a Crais fan, you've got to come back to this one to get to know Elvis' sidekick, Pike.  In the tradition of Parker (early) and Block, Crais gives his characters some depth in addition to weaving a good mystery yarn.  LARequiem develops Pike and gives us his life story while putting him into the spell-binding mystery.	2002-01-04

It is difficult to put this book in a traditional pigeon hole, but it is sure worth the read.  Hunter gives us interesting characters in an interesting place and time with just enough real folks and history that you keep thinking it really happened.	2001-10-16

Mr. Snyder is brutally honest recounting his period of unemployment and the emotions he experienced.  It is  great book whether a reader has been unemployed or not.  Mr. Snyder's writing was clear and entertaining.  I will move on to his novels based upon the writing style he evidenced in this very personal memoir.	2001-10-16
