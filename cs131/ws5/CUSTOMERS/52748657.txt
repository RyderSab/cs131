I like to watch modern films, but just as often I like to pause in front of the classics section at the video store and pick something out I feel I should have seen. This book is the one I usually take with me, and it has paid off handsomely. I'd have never seen the wonderful \\"Touch of Class\\" (Glenda Jackson/George Segal) without this book, or \\"Lilies of the Field\\", or many others. <br /> <br />The book has useful lists of all Academy Award winners, and I like the way he keeps separate lists for the \\"big four\\" (director, picture, actor, actress) and all the other awards. A movie that wins one of the big four awards is almost always worth seeing; a movie that wins one of the others is a bit more of a risk, especially after forty or fifty years have passed. <br /> <br />The book is useful for reference, but less valuable as a source of information about the quality of the films. It seems clear Pickard hasn't actually seen every one of these movies. He does give clear and (I've found) reliable opinions about many films, but quite a few of the descriptions just give the facts and some background information. <br /> <br />Recommended, as a reference at least, and for the comments on some of the films.	2005-09-16

The books are remarkable: detailed, thoughtful, poignant when tragedy intrudes, but never sentimental; sharp, witty, affectionate and truly insightful. <br /> <br />Hughes's family was middle class, so that being poor, for her, meant being barely able to afford to go to school, rather than work.  They usually had servants, though only one or two.  All four older boys are intelligent, interesting people, though Mary claims only one of them as \\"clever\\".  Yet it's clear from the first volume that they were all lovers of literature, art, and intelligent conversation, and as Mary grew up the youngest in such a household she not unnaturally grew to love the same things, despite lacking a formal education until she was eleven. <br /> <br />Her stories span all of life, from schooldays and children's games in the first book, to married life and heartbreaking tragedy in the last.  She visits America to attend an educational conference at the Chicago World's fair in the early 1890's; and sees Washington, Montreal and Boston, too.  She visits Cornwall and Wales, and of course there are many, many stories of London and London life.  There is an enormous amount of detail here, loving told and a delight to read.  This is the best kind of history to read -- true and faithful to the facts but more interesting than almost any novel could be. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.  If you're hesitating, I recommend at least the first volume, which you can buy separately here on Amazon; though I feel sure you'll want the other two when you've read that one.	2005-09-05

During that time, while still single, she visits the World's Fair in Chicago to attend an educational conference, and manages to visit Washington and Boston as well. <br /> <br />There are stories about her prospective in-laws; her brothers and their families; her fianc; and her work as a teacher and a trainer of other teachers. The stories are uniformly well-told and interesting, but the book feels a little more episodic than the first two, both of which have a densely textured feel, as Hughes recounts in loving detail old memories.

This volume may be the best of the three, because in the first one Mary Hughes is just a child, but in this book she more clearly shows what a remarkable person she was. <br /> <br />She was raised in a family that valued education and literature, and although she attended no school until she was eleven, she was an outstanding pupil and was one of the first women in a new teacher's training college in Cambridge.

Her stories of school, family and college life are detailed enough to feel intimate and closely-observed enough to be truly informative about what life was like in the 1880's.

This book helps fill the gap so thoroughly you will feel like a friend of the family at the end of it. <br /> <br />The books are moving, too: her large family was not immune to tragedy, and it is an emotional shock when a death occurs. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended; but I would suggest you read the first volume before this -- it is just as good, and if you read it you will enjoy this one even more.	2005-09-04

I'd think that's about as good as most non-academics are going to get, so take this review for what it's worth on that basis.    Without a single exception, every one of those 125 books I'd read is a book I would recommend.  Some of those recommendations would be with caveats: for example Thucydides \\"History of the Peloponnesian War\\" is not for those uninterested in history in the first place, and it's best if you have an interest in historiography.  But there are no duds at all in the list.    I was surprised at some of the choices, and some of the omissions.  I know that a good many books are omitted for copyright reasons -- Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and others.  Others are due to be added to the series soon: the Christian Bible, for example.  But the choices, while debatable, are uniformly excellent.    I'd give this five stars, but it's unrealistic to expect anyone to actually buy this.  Instead, I recommend you use this as a checklist: pick a couple of the authors you've never heard of on here and try them out -- or try a book you don't know by an author you do know.  If you've read Steinbeck's \\"The Red Pony\\", try \\"Of Mice and Men\\", or the incredible \\"Grapes of Wrath\\"; if you liked Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", try \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\".  The authors represented by only a single work are also worth a shot--Jerome's \\"Three Men in a Boat\\" is supremely funny, and there are more -- Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", for example.    Enough lists: the whole thing is just a list.  Use it to refer to for your own reading and you won't be sorry -- and buy it if you really do have the shelf space, the money, and the time.	2005-08-25

The two should be regarded almost as a single (very long) book: only someone already expert on the history of the period would read this one without the first. <br /> <br />When this book opens, in November 1641, the country is not yet at war.  The manoeuvres between King and Parliament are by this time open conflicts: in January the King's men attempt to seize the Parliamentary ringleaders by force, but are foiled; by July the descent into warfare has begun. <br /> <br />Much of the book is concerned with details of the campaigns from the autumn of 1642 through the end of 1645, though some military action did continue into 1646.  As in the first book, Wedgwood takes the slightly unusual approach of sticking very closely to a linear narrative of the events, instead of providing an overview and filling in details.  This technique worked excellently in covering the political intrigues in the first book, but is weaker here, where the ebbs and flows of a military campaign are sometimes best understood from a distance.  She keeps it as interesting as she can, but the book improves again when the fighting is over and she relates the last year of Charles' freedom. <br /> <br />Charles was utterly intransigent over the points which he would have had to concede to save him.  Wedgwood has little respect for his political or intellectual capabilities, but she fully recognizes his integrity, a quality which dooms him but makes him admirable despite his failings. <br /> <br />Wedgwood writes clearly and without too much ornamentation, though her style is not at all simplified.

The coverage is necessarily incomplete--if Wills had identified every culture and conflict alive in that year there'd have been only a sentence on each.  It's thorough even so, and by 1688 the world was truly a global network:  the Spanish mining silver in Bolivia; the Dutch bloodily extracting spices from the Indonesian archipelagoes; the British making their first military probes into India.  The Tsar of Russia visited London; there were Armenian traders in Lhasa, English scientists in Australia, and Jesuits almost everywhere.<br /><br />The coverage is so broad that Wills cannot do any one story real justice.  He copes with this by picking specific narratives and telling them in detail, interspersing these stories among the general cultural and historical background.  He covers the progress of the great religions, and literature and science as well as the struggles for empire -- this was the age of Locke, Leibniz and Newton, after all.  And 1688 is a good choice for other reasons: the English Revolution of that year is the hook on which Wills hangs much material about the religious strife of the seventeenth century, for example.<br /><br />The writing is clear and transparent.  The book's only real weak point is that nothing is described in much detail; nothing gets more than a few pages.  The result is that when you've finished you feel more as if you'd been reading newspapers about the year than a history text.  You don't feel you know these cultures in depth -- you know them the way a slightly educated contemporary might have known them: by reputation, with a few high points.  However, I think that's a fine result for a book like this.  It certainly made me want to read half a dozen more books to get more details.  I don't think this is a good book to start with, though, if you don't already have some awareness of this period of history; it is not truly introductory for any of the cultures covered.  For those interested, though, it is well able to whet your appetite for more.cultures covered.  For those interested, though, it is well able to whet your appetite for more.	2005-06-20
US	52748657	R1V0WFSA179A75	0002727463	277351758	The Steel Bonnets: The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers	Books	5	89	89	N	N	Thorough, well-structured, and entertaining	Until England and Scotland were united under a single king in March 1603, the border between them was, unsurprisingly, a natural place for strife and disorder.  The two countries had been at war intermittently for centuries, and many armies had passed back and forth across the border counties.  Fraser's history covers the last hundred years of the border, from 1503 to 1603, a period during which the decayed (and astonishingly corrupt) administration could never cope with the local gangs -- known as \\"reivers\\" -- who terrorized the district with cattle theft, murder, and arson. <br /> <br />The book is very well-organized.  Fraser starts with a few pages on the long historical background, then takes about half the book to cover the reivers by topic: chapters on arms and armour; on reiving technique; on the key families and their alliances; on cross-border relations; on the administrative structure.  Fraser gives a lot of details, and plenty of quotes from the original sources (with the original spellings!). <br /> <br />This painstaking coverage sets up the second half of the book perfectly: one hundred and forty pages that cover the history of the border chronologically through the sixteenth century.  With the details in hand, the second half is easy to follow and put in context; the writing is also clear and entertaining. <br /> <br />The last section of the book details the uncompromising way in which King James I destroyed the reivers in a few short years after 1603.  It is a startlingly bloodthirsty story: Fraser includes quotes from blanket pardons that King James issued to some of his enforcers, which essentially say \\"whatever murders you did, I'm sure it was in a good cause, and you're absolved\\". <br /> <br />There are separate chapters on some of the most famous events, notably the raid on Carlisle Castle that freed Kinmont Willie.  Fraser is at some pains to dispel the romantic ideas that cling to stories of the borderers -- as he points out, they were essentially a Mafia, with little of Robin Hood about them. It's clear, though, that he finds their adventurousness and style endearing and fascinating; and he writes about them so well that you are likely to feel the same way.	2005-06-09
US	52748657	R2R11FQA4TR1F1	0192803875	4897038	Mission to Tashkent	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Adventure in Central Asia	Central Asia, from the Caspian to western China, was the arena for \\"The Great Game\\", the nineteenth-century war of espionage and diplomacy between Russia and Britain.  The Russians wanted domination of central Asia; the British wanted to protect India and expand their empire, by influence at least if not by conquest. <br /> <br />Bailey's story comes right at the very end of the Great Game.  At the end of the first world war he was sent to Tashkent, in what is now Uzbekistan.  The Bolsheviks were taking over Russia which had conquered this part of central Asia (called Russian Turkestan), but at that time, as Bailey says, \\"no one quite knew what a Bolshevik was or what were his aims and objects\\".  The goal of Bailey's mission was to find out more about what was going on, and if possible persuade them into the war on the Allied side. <br /> <br />Bailey travelled to Kashgar (now in China) and then via Andijan (now in Kyrgyzstan) to Tashkent.  Much of the book is about his stay in Tashkent and the deteriorating relationship with the Bolsheviks.  As more information came in about the British fighting against the Bolsheviks elsewhere, and as Bolshevik central control improved, Bailey's position became more and more dangerous.  He had a good local counter espionage network, and was able to get warning of impending arrests and take measures to neutralize the information against him, but ultimately it became clear he would have to leave secretly or be executed very soon. <br /> <br />After some time (and some adventures) hiding in a village nearby, he returned to Tashkent where he lived using a succession of false papers.  When he realized from the limited news he had access to that there was no chance of the regime being overthrown by any of the civil wars or Allied offensives, he decided to head back to British territory.  It turned out the Soviet counter-espionage group believed Bailey was in Bokhara, and had sent fifteen agents there to find him; all had been killed.  Using his false papers, Bailey volunteered to be the sixteenth and in a move straight from a Bond novel was sent to Bokhara to try to locate himself. <br /> <br />In Bokhara the adventure was not over, as there was a long stretch of hostile desert to cross (what is now Turkmenistan).  The group was fired on by bandits as they made the last dash to cross into Persia, then a friendly country. <br /> <br />The book is exciting, primarily because the events are completely believable yet often amazing.  Bailey's no great prose stylist, but his writing is clear and straightforward.  One oddity that will strike modern readers is that he frequently lists the local wildlife (including the Latin names) in terms of what he was able to shoot.  However, after a couple of chapters, the true espionage story starts, and the book becomes absolutely gripping.  One other note: Bailey refers to several photographs, but these are not in this paperback edition, which is the one I have.   <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.  If you're interested in the history of this time and place, you may also want to read Peter Hopkirk's \\"Setting The East Ablaze\\", which recounts Bailey's story in considerable detail and provides a great deal more background information and historical setting.	2005-05-19
US	52748657	R2YUPBTKMXIG2E	0802137660	342863234	Cromwell	Books	3	52	59	N	N	Detailed, pro-Cromwell, and a bit too long	Cromwell is perhaps the single most controversial figure in English history.  Only John and Richard III have attracted as much venom as he has, and there are still people alive today who hate him -- see some of the other reviews here for at least one example.  Naturally the truth is complicated, and Fraser lays out a good deal of detail in support of her case, which is that Cromwell was much maligned, and was on the whole a good and religious man trying hard to do what he thought was right.<br />I had no prior belief about Cromwell, but I have to say Fraser convinced me rather of the opposite -- that he was a religious fanatic, brilliant but limited, who was neither a great ruler nor personally very admirable.  Her apologies for some of his worst sins, such as the terrible events in Ireland, are outlandish.<br />On the plus side, this is a thorough and detailed book, with enough information to allow a reader to make up their own mind.  Fraser does at least keep the facts separate from her opinions.  The book is excellent on Cromwell himself; it's pretty good on details of the Civil Wars, though it doesn't go to the level that an exclusively military history might.  However, it's surprisingly weak on the overall political background.  To truly understand Cromwell you need to know what came before and after.  I would have liked to see more about the religious state of the country, and why it got that way, and also about the Revolution of only thirty years after his death.  But in concentrating on Cromwell the man (at perhaps too great a length), Fraser has skimped on the surrounding politics.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this only if you're deeply interested in knowing a lot about Cromwell's life, or if you already know the political and religious framework of the years 1640-1660.  If you know both, this is a fine book (allowing for Fraser's open bias) but it's no place to start.<br />One other note: the paperback edition (which is what I have) does not have any of thephotographs or other plates that are apparently in the hardback -- Fraser makes occasional reference to \\"the plate opposite page 709\\" and so on, so I would bear that in mind in choosing between the two editions.	2004-01-18

Almost nothing gets a lot of detail, but almost nothing is omitted.  The chapters cover the following topics:<br />1 - history of offshore drilling<BR>2 - the move into deeper and deeper water in the eighties<BR>3 - exploration<BR>4 - drilling and completion<BR>5 - development systems<BR>6 - fixed structures -- compliant towers, concrete, etc.<BR>7 - floating systems -- TLPs, FPSOs, spars, and so on<BR>8 - subsea systems<BR>9 - topsides<BR>10 - piplines, flowlines, and risers<BR>11 - technology and the future<br />The writing is sound, and there are plenty of decent graphics -- pictures of the gigantic Bullwinkle platform; photographs and schematics of equipment and layouts; and a couple of colour plates showing seismic analysis displays.  The chapters are really just overviews -- although there's a fair amount of detail in some areas, particularly in platform construction and assembly, there is so much to say that they can't do more than scratch the surface.<br />The book does give you quite a lot of vocabulary to work with, which is valuable.  There are a multitude of online oil and gas glossaries that you might want to search for via the web, but the narrative form that this book provides is a pretty good way to understand them too.<br />If you are new to E&amp;P and would like a good overview, this is a pretty good place to start, but it won't take you very far in any one direction.	2003-11-28
US	52748657	R3AQASHFJ63ZF8	0765602431	675898396	Azerbaijan Diary: A Rogue Reporter's Adventures in an Oil-rich, War-torn, Post-Soviet Republic	Books	3	26	29	N	N	Eyewitness reporting of the post-Soviet aftermath	Thomas Goltz spent six years as a  reporter in and around Azerbaijan, starting in 1991.  He saw the collapse of the USSR and the start of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, and filed many war-zone reports.  The result is fascinating, though a little uneven in places: Goltz is a fine war reporter, but not the best historiographer in the world.<br />Despite the title, the book is not quite a diary, although there is a good detail of day-to-day detail about life in Azerbaijan (he spent most of his time in Baku).  The book's two main foci are the political history of Azerbaijan during this period, and the conflict with Armenia.  The political history is done very well -- Goltz introduces a large cast, keeps them fairly distinct, and through his personal acquaintance with almost all of them brings them to life.  It's clear that Goltz acquired a good deal of affection for the Azerbaijanis, and he is enraged by the corruption and indifference of many of the Azerbaijan political class.  When, in the end, the old Soviet-era fox Heydar Aliyev wins power and actually gets the Caspian oil (and concomitant money) to flow via deals with international oil companies, Goltz is grudgingly respectful -- Aliyev may be lying about his democratic credentials, but he did achieve some benefit to Azerbaijan, which is more than most of his predecessors did.<br />As I said, Goltz is fond of the Azerbaijanis, and this does come through in his reporting of the war, which as a result feels a little less even-handed.  There's no doubt about the accuracy of his central complaint, often-repeated: that the Armenians, apparently with Russian help, were directly involved in the Karabakh conflict, despite all their claims that it was mere \\"volunteerism\\"; and that the media has generally been much kinder to the Armenians than they deserve.  He is also scathing about the Azerbaijan military's incompetence and corruption; and he finds the time to make positive comments about Armenia, though he spent relatively little time there.  Still, he is pro-Azeri, and it occasionally shows.<br />The blurb urges you to read this for the adventure if you're not interested in the politics or history, and there are certainly some scary moments as Goltz barely makes it out of some of the more dangerous places alive.  But I can't recommend it for that alone.  If you like politics and history, this is a great source on Azerbaijan in the 90's; it's not great writing but it's interesting and has details you won't find anywhere else.	2003-10-25
US	52748657	R2E6USSRGOX6ZD	0345404335	46057174	The Wars of the Roses	Books	4	187	194	N	N	Clear, readable, and well-narrated	The Wars of the Roses are one of the most confusing periods of English history.  From the origins in the rivalries between Edward III's children to the final resolution with the founding of the Tudor dynasty by Henry VII, there are eight kings, including some of the best and worst England has had; and literally scores of major figures and families: the Nevilles, the Percys, the Woodvilles, the Beauforts, the Cliffords, the Bourchiers -- the list is endless. <br />Making this all comprehensible the first time through is simply impossible.  Weir almost manages it, though; her style is very readable and friendly, and exciting without being sensational.  Weir begins with a short section describing what England was like in the fifteenth century; then she starts the story proper with Edward III, whose five sons and their families are the central players in the history.<br />She ends her story in 1471, with the defeat of the Lancastrians and the subsequent murder of Henry VI.  She only gives a page or two to the remainder of Edward IV's reign, and to the story of Richard III and the princes in the tower, and Henry VII's ultimate accession in 1485.  This is almost certainly because she has covered this ground in another book, &quot;The Princes In The Tower&quot;.  The omission is understandable but still rather a mistake -- the conflict doesn't end till the Tudors are on the throne (and not even then, really -- there were pretenders for years).<br />The only other criticism I have is that the genealogy tables at the back are too small to read easily.  I tried using a magnifying glass but the reproduction is poor enough that some letters are blurred into unreadability.  Even when it's readable, it's more work than it should be; this is a real problem for a book about the Wars of the Roses, where understanding the genealogy is crucial to keeping your bearings.<br />Overall I can recommend this strongly, just because it'll give you the overall narrative clearly and excitingly,but you'll need another source to cover the period from 1471 to 1485.	2003-10-10

The result is entertaining and full of good factual information, but as a story it is so lopsided as to be useless if you're not already familiar with the history of the period.<br />Seward writes well enough, though his style's not as entertaining as Alison Weir's (whose history of this period is a much better place to start).  The problem is not his style, though; there are simply too many threads in the story for this to be a good way of telling it.  Seward tries hard to make the historical sequence mesh with the stories of his five protagonists; he cuts the story into chapters which are in chronological order and each of which revolves primarily around one of the five.  However, the points at which the book flows most smoothly as history are exactly the points where he focuses least on his protagonists.<br />If you don't think of this as a history of the Wars of the Roses, though, and instead think of it as five interlaced biographical sketches, this is a very worthwhile book.  Because of the focus Seward has chosen, there is a lot more detail about these individuals than you will find in most of the histories.  The men in particular stand out: the Earl of Oxford, William Hasting, and John Morton.  The women (Margaret Beaufort and Jane Shore) are less memorable, sadly; mainly because there is so little actual information about them, and they were perforce only indirect players in much of the political manoeuvering of the age.<br />Recommended; but read something else first -- this is better as background material than as an overview of the period.	2003-10-10
US	52748657	R11FSNW3M81SIJ	1582369607	278655781	Maps of Middle Earth: The Lord of the Rings Map Set	Books	3	103	107	N	N	Attractive maps but doesn't cover all of Middle Earth	This set consists of six maps, each of which folds out to about 22&quot; by 16&quot;, and a booklet.  The maps don't cover all of Middle Earth -- instead they are regional maps that cover all the main action of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.<br />The six maps are as follows, in more or less the order in which the characters in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; encounter them.<BR>1. The Shire.  Includes all of the Shire, and goes beyond to include Lake Evendim in the north, the beginning of the Gulf of Lune in the west, and Bree on the far eastern edge.  Hence it also includes the Old Forest and the Barrow Downs.<BR>2. Eregion. From Lothlorien in the southeast to Bree in the northwest; includes the Misty Mountains from just north of Fangorn up to the southern edge of the Ettenmoors.  This one is at 30 miles to the inch; the others are all at 20 miles to the inch.<BR>3. Rohan.  Includes Isengard at the western edge of the map; all of Fangorn forest, north as far the field of Celebrant at the southern edge of Mirkwood, and east to the east shore of the Anduin, including the Emyn Muil.<BR>4. West Gondor.  The Lefnui river runs down the west edge of this map, which covers Pinnath Gelin, the Blackroot Vale, and Dol Amroth in the southeast.<BR>5. East Gondor.  Belfalas in the southwest, with Dol Amroth just off the map; the mouths of the Anduin and east as far as south Ithilien and the foothills of the Mountains of Shadow.  Minas Tirith is there, of course, and Osgiliath, but Minas Morgul is off the eastern edge of the map.  Cair Andros is right at the north edge.<BR>6. Mordor.  Mordor is a nice rectangular shape for a map, and the map covers it more or less exactly, with the addition of Ithilien as far as Osgiliath down the west edge.<br />The maps are not colourful--click on the image of the box on the Amazon page and you'll see an enlarged view that shows the legend areas of all six maps; the colouring there is just as it is on the maps themselves, so that should give you an idea.  However, despite the lack of strong colour, the calligraphy and cartography are beautiful.<br />Reeve does not appear to have taken any liberties that I can see with the topography as described by Tolkien, either by inventing extra names to fill in blank spaces or changing anything.  I was a bit surprised to see how large the Shire was, though; it's the same land area as Rohan, which simply astonished me -- I thought of it as a tiny place, perhaps sixty or so miles across, but Reese makes it over 250 miles from west to east, including Westmarch and Buckland.  I went back to the original maps at the back of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, and realized that Tolkien had in fact drawn it at least 150 miles across--the scale is so small it's hard to be precise--but it's still surprising.<br />The booklet includes information about all the major regions of Middle Earth, whether or not they are on the map.  On the back cover is a map of all of Middle Earth.  Sadly, there's no overall poster to go with it--I'm still looking for a good one.  The booklet is informative and moderately detailed; I would guess it's a handbook for a role-playing game, since a game is mentioned in the cover, but there are no more details.<br />Overall, this is an attractive set of maps for a good price.  The weak points are the lack of colour, and the fact that only parts of Middle Earth are mapped.	2003-09-21
US	52748657	R3FY6PVE7T9LS	0094719306	390155966	Attila, King of the Huns: Man and Myth (Celtic Interest)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Needs maps and more real information	Every book on Attila shares the same problem: there are simply not enough sources for there to be much real information that a historian can share.  Howarth struggles heroically to find enough to fill a book, but even with substantial padding there are less than 190 pages.  The last three or four chapters review the myth of Attila, rather than the man: in other words Howarth tells the tale of various operas and stories that feature Attila.  These are mildly interesting but aren't history in any sense of the word.<br />The book's worst fault, however, is that there are no maps.  This is an inexcusable omission, particularly since even readers familiar with European geography are not likely to know the areas by the names current sixteen hundred years ago -- do you know where Pannonia is?  Instead, there are several photographs of films and paintings of Attila; a poor substitute, considering that the renditions are all completely fanciful -- no good likeness survives.<br />Even with these criticisms, though, this is a worthwhile book if you simply want to know the background and basic facts about Attila and the Huns.  Partly because there is so little direct information about Attila himself, Howarth gives quite a bit of background about the Huns and the state of the Roman Empire at the time.  The book is well-written and a pleasure to read; the lack of sources is not Howarth's fault, after all.<br />One other note: there is only one surviving eye-witness account of Attila, and Howarth quotes quite a bit from it here.  However, there is rather more of it quoted in the &quot;Eyewitness to History&quot; edited by John Carey, which I can strongly recommend.	2003-08-03

I am a member of a word puzzle organization ... and this is our standard reference, along with the unabridged version, \\"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\\". Many very obscure words show up in puzzles, but it is relatively rare I find I have to go to the unabridged dictionary to look them up.<br />In addition to being thorough (with excellent sections such as biography, geographical names, and foreign words and phrases (such as \\"en plein jour\\" or \\"inshallah\\") it includes compressed but informative etymological data. For example, the entry on \\"spacious\\" has this - ME, fr. AF spacioux, fr. L spatiosus, fr. spatium: space, room (14c)\\"; in a little over a single line you get a long lineage; though I should mention that this has been slightly corrected since the tenth edition of this dictionary.  You may have to learn some of the abbreviations (Middle English, Anglo-French, 14th century) but I found them generally intuitive and didn't need to look them up much at all.<br />In addition, there are excellent usage paragraphs scattered throughout. These are of two types. One type compares the usage of different words with very similar meanings. For example, the entry on \\"satiate\\" provides a usage paragraph that compares \\"satiate\\", \\"sate\\", \\"surfeit\\", \\"cloy\\", \\"pall\\", \\"glut\\" and \\"gorge\\", identifying the precise differences of usage between them. The paragraph is cross-referenced at each of the other six words, so you don't have to just stumble across satiate to find it.<br />The other kind of usage paragraph discusses correctness. A good example is \\"hopefully\\", which in its sense \\"I hope that\\" is controversial. The dictionary asserts the validity of this controversial use, which is sure to annoy some purists, but it does acknowledge the debate and cite grammatical arguments for its position.<br />There are quite a few new words (my favourite is \\"dead-cat bounce\\") and edits to all sections.  The only major change, though, is that the abbreviations section has been eliminated; abbreviations are now included in the main body of the dictionary.<br />The dictionary is available online at m-w.com, and I strongly recommend you take a look at it. There is a CD-ROM for sale too, which is worth getting as it adds some fancy search features, though if you're like me you'll want the paper version to keep by the bed.  Note that if you have the unabridged MW CD too (the third edition of their New International Dictionary) then the same interface allows you to choose which dictionary to search -- a very nice feature.  Purchase of the dictionary also gives you a complimentary year's subscription to the m-w website, which is worth having -- though be warned that it will automatically renew in a year for $ unless you choose to auto-cancel.<I> --This text refers to an edition which conatins a CD-ROM.

US	52748657	R1NXHKFT7GPBY1	0874778883	651232010	Seven Years in Tibet	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Across the Himalayas	Heinrich Harrer was a member of the Austrian Olympic skiing team in 1936, and a capable mountain climber.  When World War II broke out he was in northern India, with a climbing expedition; and was interned by the British before he could make it back to the Europe to join up.  He and several companions made several attempts to escape, finally succeeding and making it across the border and into Tibet.<br />At that time Tibet was extremely difficult to enter.  For a wonderful history of western attempts to reach Lhasa, I recommend Peter Hopkirk's &quot;Trespassers on the Roof of the World&quot;.  The Tibetans had adopted a policy of complete isolation, and it was only after an appallingly difficult journey and many hazards, along with much trouble with local officials and bureaucracy, that Harrer and his companions finally reached Lhasa.  Much of the story deals with the journey itself; the chapter &quot;The Worst Trek of All&quot; ends with them within reach of Lhasa itself.  A chapter or two later, they are granted asylum there -- a very rare event -- and they find useful employment in civil engineering works around the city.  Harrer includes a great deal of observation of Tibetan private and public life.<br />Harrer was also fortunate enough to meet and make good friends with the Dalai Lama.  Unfortunately Harrer is a bit vague on dates, but it appears he was the Dalai Lama's tutor for a bit less than a year.  In that time he got to know him well, and was clearly a strong influence on the boy, although the Dalai Lama was a powerful character in his own right, knowing clearly what he wanted and what he thought was right.  Harrer built a cinema for him and shot movie film for him around Lhasa, and talked to him about Western technology.<br />Finally, in November 1950, Harrer, the Dalai Lama and many other Tibetans fled as the Chinese invaded.  Among the photographs in the book is one of the Dalai Lama's caravan escaping through the Himalayas.  The book was published in 1953, but there is an epilogue, written in 1966, covering events in Tibet since then; a sad story.<br />Harrer is no great stylist, but this is a famous travelogue for good reason.  Recommended.	2003-07-24
US	52748657	R33BTFL645EELX	1568361270	697623546	Like Hidden Fire: The Plot to Bring Down the British Empire	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Engrossing and enthralling	&quot;Like Hidden Fire&quot; is another of Hopkirk's wonderful books about central Asia.  He begins in the 19th century with some political backstory, but this is essentially a book about a subplot of the First World War.  Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany wanted to find a way to destabilize the British holdings in south and central Asia, and had lost no opportunity over the previous twenty years to win the friendship of Islamic nations, particularly Turkey,the core of the tattered Ottoman Empire.  When war broke out, the Germans set plans in motion to incite revolts in India and Afghanistan, and to take over control of Persia, nominally neutral but in fact a battleground for the great powers.<br />Over the four years of the war, the consequences of this German plan played out in individual dramas of espionage, diplomacy and military action.  Hopkirk covers both sides of the story, and does a better job than in his &quot;The Great Game&quot; of keeping a fairly even-handed tone.  Some of the German exploits were astonishing -- particularly those of Captain Niedermayer, who by a horrifying series of forced marches penetrated the Persia-Afghanistan border with a diplomatic mission to the Emir of Afghanistan.  The British heroes are covered too: Ranald McDonell, Edward Noel, and most interestingly, Reginald Teague-Jones, who disappeared at the end of the war in mysterious circumstances.  Hopkirk did a good deal of work and ultimately did manage to trace Teague-Jones.  I won't spoil the surprise by telling you what he found, but there are clearly still mysteries waiting to be revealed when the UK goverment opens up the 100 year old files in a few more years time.<br />Political events of the time had an impact on the story too, most notably the Bolshevik revolution, which changed the course of Russian involvement and hence the balance of power in south Asia.  One event is covered in detail -- the massacre of the commissars in Baku in 1919.  Once an icon of Soviet political mythology, the vast memorial built there was torn down in 1990 after the collapse of the USSR.<br />If you are new to Hopkirk, I'd recommend reading &quot;The Great Game&quot; first, because as well as being immensely entertaining it will give you a broad and thorough grounding in the political background to imperial politics in Asia.  But after that, this is a great follow-up.	2003-07-22

Any book that can simply be coherent and readable while covering so much ground is an achievement. John Keay's &quot;India: A History&quot; is more than that, though; it is superbly-written and powerfully narrated.<br />Keay notes in the introduction that he has deliberately avoided focusing more on recent history than on ancient: &quot;a history which reserves half its narrative for the 19th and 20th centuries may seem more relevant, but it can scarcely do justice to India's extraordinary antiquity.&quot;  Naturally the availability of more historical sources does increase the attention paid to recent events, but still the Raj does not appear till nearly three quarters of the way through, and the 20th century and the real start of the struggle for independence is close to the end of the book.  The result is a long, thoughtful and detailed telling of many of the dynasties and civilization that flourished in India -- though, as Keay also says in the introduction, only the highlights are mentioned, since &quot;with perhaps 20 to 40 dynasties co-existing within the subcontinent at any one time, it would be [. . .] sado-masochism [to include them all]&quot;.  So even at this extra level of detail there has been substantial editing.  And there could have been more; the book's only fault is that Keay mentions just too many of the endless dynastic dramas.  The essence of a one-volume history is selective editing, and the book could have been shorter and a little less dry in places.<br />However, the picture of India that emerges is deep, complex and fascinating, from the earliest Harappan archaeological relics through to the Gandhis.  The Raj is of course particularly interesting: although technologically and industrially the British clearly surpassed them greatly at the time of the Raj, some of the diplomatic exchanges that Keay retails show the Indians as being more sophisticated, morecivilized, and in many ways just smarter than the British.  It was inevitable that the yoke would be thrown off; the only question was what India would be able to do with its independence.<br />Keay's prose is also a great pleasure; he has a wonderfully dry sense of humour, and he conveys exciting events with panache but also with precision and clarity.<br />Recommended.	2003-07-22
US	52748657	R2RW1OO46UL7JG	0140132716	961055788	Eastern Approaches	Books	5	65	65	N	N	Spectacular entertainment	In the mid-thirties Fitzroy Maclean was a junior diplomat at the British embassy in Paris.  Bored with the pleasant but undemanding routine, he requested a posting to Moscow, and &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot; opens with Maclean on a train, pulling out of Paris. Most of this first section of the book covers his repeated attempts to explore Soviet central Asia.  He reached Bokhara, Samarkand, Tashkent and many other places, and though there are sadly few pictures it is a riveting story -- fighting Soviet bureaucracy; being trailed by the NKVD; negotiating with locals for food and a place to sleep.  At one point he manages with difficulty to persuade the Soviets to let him cross into Afghanistan: communicating primarily in sign language he manages to obtain an escort to Mazar-i-Sharif, through a lawless area with a cholera outbreak.<br />Maclean was in Moscow until late 1939, and so was present during the great Stalinist purges.  One long chapter is devoted to one of the largest of these, in which Bukharin, Yagoda and other stalwarts of the Stalinist regime were accused (and of course convicted) of heinous crimes.  The details of the trial, and the responses of the accused, are utterly fascinating; Maclean's analysis equally so.<br />When war broke out, Maclean was prevented from enlisting at first because of his position as a diplomat.  He eventually managed to sign up by a subterfuge, and in North Africa Maclean distinguished himself in the early actions of the newly formed SAS.  He rose from private to officer rank, and Churchill personally chose him to lead a liaison mission to central Yugoslavia, where Tito and his partisans were emerging as a major irritant to the German control of the Balkans.  The last third of the book recounts how over eighteen months Maclean built Allied/Partisan cooperation from nothing to a key element in the last phases of the war.  By the end, Maclean was a Major-General, and a friend of Tito's.<br />Maclean is a fine writer, with the British gift for understatement and wry humour.  His exploits are said to have formed the basis for the character of James Bond, though Maclean would never confirm or deny this.  The sequence when he personally kidnaps a Persian general who is collaborating with the Germans is certainly straight out of a Bond film. The book is spectacularly entertaining: if you have any taste for history, adventure, travel writing or war-time memoirs, this is as good as it gets.	2003-05-03

All his books since then have been worth reading, though they vary in quality: &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; was unusually thoughtful (and very good), but by and large he became famous as the champion of the cutting remark and the unkind anecdote.<br />&quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; shows him mellowing a little.  He still has a penchant for visiting odd things and places, and bumping into strange people -- giant earthworms, a town called Tittybong, and the proprietor of the Lambing Flat museum all come to mind -- but he's nice about them.  It's an odd thing to say if you're used to reading Bryson, but this book is a traditional travelogue.<br />It's still entertaining.  Bryson is a good writer, and there is so much in Australia to write about -- aborigines, myxomatosis, Ayers Rock, the Great Barrier Reef, and a huge array of lethal wildlife, some of which he comes a little too close to for comfort.  He does a good job of summing up history and adding a dollop of what's going on today, and he conveys a good sense of place.  Occasionally the old caustic note comes through again, when he recounts the story of a self-important early Australian administrator, or has a hard time finding decent food in Canberra, but it's no longer the dominant note in the book.<br />I can still recommend this as a fine travel book.  Classic Bryson it isn't, though; so if you're a Bryson fan you may be a little disappointed.	2001-06-03

At age 13, Michael Dirda chanced upon Clifton Fadiman's &quot;The Lifetime Reading Plan&quot;, a collection of short essays about a hundred great books.  These days, Fadiman is regarded as middlebrow, says Dirda, but &quot;for a young boy [it] did precisely what it intended: it made classics sound as exciting as Tarzan or Fu Manchu.&quot;  Thus began a lifelong infatuation with reading and books.<br />&quot;Readings&quot; collects forty-odd essays about a book fanatic's life, all taken from the &quot;Washington Post Book World.&quot;  Dirda is a fine critic, with thoughtful and perceptive comments scattered throughout this collection.  But I say book fanatic, rather than critic or reviewer or even reader, because these essays are not about literature.  They *are* literature; they're reminiscences and ruminations about things bookish.<br />I'm a book collector, like Dirda, and I find him wonderful: precise, witty and entertaining -- but I wonder how many others, who don't suffer from book addiction, will really understand this book.  If you've ever lusted to get every book by an author; or to get a first edition of your favourite book; or to collect a full set of books of some special kind (like those fifties Ace double paperbacks, with an upside down book in the back -- cool!) then you'll understand Dirda perfectly.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, you may not.<br />However, James Herriot once said that enthusiasts are endearing but fanatics are irresistible, and I think most people will find Dirda a delightful fanatic.  He is funny when he relates a diary of his Saturday (including sneaking off to a book fair and picking up several good finds), or a list of writer's secret fantasies (J.D. Salinger loves your work and invites you to visit!); he's argumentative when he asserts that Homer, Plato, Ovid and Dante are better assignments as high school reading than Kingsolver, Styron, Dorris and Tan; and he's always informative.  Everything sounds so interestingwhen he writes about it.  He makes you want to read it all -- Wodehouse, Shakespeare, even the erotic novel he found lying in a puddle at age 14.<br />His anecdotes are good, but readers will also find his habit of lists invaluable.  I started to make notes of books I'd like to read as I went through this collection, but soon gave up -- every other essay provides a list.  It's easier just to bring this book to the bookstore to refer to as you browse.  One essay lists a hundred recommended comic novels; another gives the essential Wodehouse; another recommends twenty-odd children's books; and there are more: vacation reading, genre bests, an alphabet list.  Between the lists and the offhand recommendations you are likely to find yourself a lot poorer when you've finished the book.	2001-05-13

The benefit is that the document you create contains only the content -- if you want to generate web pages, or a printable file, the same source text file will do both for you.  This can save you a lot of time in maintaining parallel print and web versions.<br />I used this book to create an employee handbook for my company in both print and web formats, and found it very handy, though it does have a couple of problems.  Good things first: it contains a complete reference to every element in the DocBook standard, so you can look up Note or SimpleList or Article or RevHistory and find everything you need to know.  This is the bulk of the book, in fact, and is what it is mostly useful for.<br />However, even these entries have one big flaw: they don't give you much of an indication of where they can be used.  For example, if you want to add a Note to your text, can you do it from the section level, or do you have to be inside a para tag?  The book won't give you this information if you look up Note--you have to look up all the different things it might be inside to find it.  In practice this isn't too bad since you tend to settle down into a default set of tags you know well; it's more of a problem when you run into an exception.<br />The first five chapters give you an overview of SGML and XML, and then take you straight into the basics of creating DocBook documents.  This section is good explanatory material and will definitely help orient you if you're not sure what DocBook can do for you.  There's also a section on how to interpret OpenJade errors, which are among the least comprehensible error messages I've ever seen.  This section is well-intentioned but not much use--the error messages are just too poorly written to be useful.  They do give you the line number though, so that's usually where you have to start.<br />Installation and setup is another matter.  There's anappendix which is helpful but there are a lot of pieces to get right and you should be prepared to take some time over this.  Get help from someone who's done it before, if possible.<br />I would have liked to see a diagram of how all the pieces fit together--SGML, the parser, transformation, the DSSSL files, and the output formats.  I had to draw my own to understand it.<br />Overall, recommended, for the explanatory material and the reference section; but it could be improved.	2001-05-12

The eight chapters cover number theory, set theory, calculus, group theory, topology, probability and the application of mathematics to the physical world.  The discussion in each chapter, couched generally in English, not mathematics, is so clear that a math-phobic can understand it.  By the end of each chapter a great deal of fascinating mathematics has been described, and in some cases the formal basis is sketched--but the emphasis is always on narration, and a lay reader who doesn't even want to understand mathematics can still read this and get a sense of the dramatic history of mathematics.<br />Devlin states at the end that he decided to exclude many areas of mathematics in order to focus more effectively on what he did cover. As a result there is little or no coverage of chaos theory, game theory, catastrophe theory, or a long list of other topics.  The fact is there will always be holes in a book this size--mathematics has expanded so much in the last hundred years that even a book ten times this size could barely survey it.  The decision to focus was a good one, and the subjects chosen are good: the truly exciting stories are here: Archimedes, Fermat, Gauss, Galois, Riemann, Wiles, and many more.<br />Potential purchasers should note, by the way, that this book was reworked from Devlin's &quot;Mathematics: The Science Of Patterns&quot;.  In Devlin's words (not from either book): &quot;The Language of Mathematics is a restructuring of Science of Patterns that omits most of the color illustrations (a minus) but has two new chapters covering topics not in Science of Patterns (a plus). If you want lots of color, go for patterns; Language of Mathematics covers more ground.&quot;  I've read both, and I have to say they're both worth getting.  The two new chapters in this book are the ones on probability and the applications of mathematics in science; they're well done and interesting.  However, the pictures in Science of Patterns are very high quality.<br />They're both fine books, and I can strongly recommend each of them.  If you have to get one, I'd say get Science of Patterns.  Even though Language of Mathematics does have some colour plates, Science of Patterns is really a gorgeous book to read with many good illustrations.  I ended up buying both, and you may end up doing that too.	2001-02-02
US	52748657	R1AVVLQR3S0RH	0883855089	315842051	The Search for E. T. Bell: Also Known as John Taine (Spectrum)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	A mathematic detective story	Eric Temple Bell, (1883-1960), was the first person to truly popularize mathematics with his classic 1937 book, &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot;.  Many mathematicians, including Reid's own sister Julia Robinson, later to become famous as one of the finest early women mathematicians, cite this book as the reason why they turned to a career in mathematics.<br />But his early life was rather a mystery, and when Albers and Alexanderson, two mathematicians who were attempting to profile Bell, talked to Reid, she became intrigued by the contradictory statements and minimal evidence about where he lived up until the early 1920's.  He'd always claimed to be Scottish--but was he born in Aberdeen or Peterhead?  He said he'd traveled around the world as a teenager--but never said exactly when or how.  He claimed to have been at the University of London, which didn't fit with what else was known about his education.  Reid talked to Bell's son Taine, and soon decided that she had a mystery to unravel.  Initially she agreed only to write the story of his early life, but eventually wrote a full biography.<br />The book is told in the present tense, as Reid walks us through her early discoveries.  This is a device that works well in the early chapters, when she is talking to folks in Peterhead and San Jose, trying to find clues; but it palls later.  By the twenties Bell's career was enough in the public record that it would have been pointless for him to lie about it, and from that point on Reid's occasional interjections in the present tense, as she relates a discovery or inconsistency, are a little jarring.<br />That's a minor point though.  The book is fascinating, both in its portrait of Bell, who was multi-faceted--a distinguished mathematician, a prolific sf author, and a top-flight popular mathematics writer--and in the story of the detective work Reid had to do.  Eventually Reid does uncover almost everything one could hope for, though Bell's motivation for lying about his past will probably never be known.  It becomes apparent by late in the book that Bell never even told his wife the truth about his first years.<br />His mathematical career is covered in reasonable detail, with some input from Lincoln Durst, who has spent much time studying Bell's papers.  It's clear that Bell was original and influential, though oddly it appears that the gift of smooth exposition so in evidence in his popular work was sometimes missing from his mathematical papers.  Apparently there have been many instances when later mathematicians have rediscovered results originally due to Bell, mainly because his papers were often obscure or poorly written.<br />The only real criticism I have is the lack of a bibliography.  Even a list of twenty or so important papers would have sufficed for the mathematics, but for the books I think it is a real omission.  Other than that, however, this is a great biography and a fascinating read.  Recommended.	2001-01-28

The narrator of &quot;One Christmas&quot; is six years old and the child of divorced parents.  He travels to New Orleans by bus to spend Christmas with his father, and the story is about his coming to terms with reality, as much as he can.  The third story, &quot;The Thanksgiving Visitor&quot;, is the tale of how Miss Sook invited the school bully to Thanksgiving dinner one year, and what happened.<br />All three are perfectly formed short stories.  The first two are sad, or at least nostalgic; the third, the longest of them, is surprisingly upbeat.  Capote was witty, precise and talented, and these three stories are a wonderful showcase for his talents.  Recommended.	2001-01-26

It's an enthralling book--I found myself staying up late to finish it, as if it were a thriller--but it's much more exciting than any thriller could be.<br />ADM sells chemicals and feed additives on a huge scale.  Mark Whitacre was the executive in charge of their lysine operation, and for reasons that only became completely clear years later he began talking to the FBI in 1992.  Soon he found himself as a cooperating witness, taping his colleagues covertly as they fixed lysine prices with Japanese and European companies.  At one point, Eichenwald notes, they reach an agreement to lock up the entire Canadian market (worth about $100 million) at an artificially inflated price; it takes them ten seconds, and comes as a postscript to a more global price fixing agreement.<br />The story is convoluted because it gradually became clear that Whitacre wasn't telling the entire truth.  Eichenwald has made the decision here to tell the story more or less as it appeared to the FBI, rather than telling it from Whitacre's point of view.  This means that the reader may not find out the true meaning of some of Whitacre's actions until quite late in the book.  Eichenwald's approach actually makes the story more exciting--it's this that gives it its thriller-like feel, since the reader fairly soon realizes there are more surprises in store.  Few readers will guess the full truth before Eichenwald reveals it, however.<br />Ultimately convictions and fines were obtained.  One wonders whether ADM has really changed, or has just gotten more careful; certainly the book makes it clear that consumers were cheated out of billions of dollars without a second thought, and it's also clear that such behaviour was rife throughout the food and feed industry.  There arealso strong hints that the Justice Department was susceptible to pressure to ease up on the case.  Eichenwald, who sticks scrupulously to what he can prove from the innumerable tapes and transcripts relating to this case, does not speculate, but it's hard to believe the industry is immaculately clean.  The free market won't seem quite so free or so desirable to you when you read this, assuming you ever believed corporate America was a good guy in the first place.<br />A great book, and an eye-opener.  Strongly recommended.	2001-01-24

The three hundred and sixty anecdotes collected here by Howard Eves deal primarily with mathematical trivia.  Most of the tales are stories about individuals--what foolish claim did Alhazen make about the Nile?  Did you know Thomas Carlyle had a mathematical background?  Sometimes he adds a little research to a well-known story.  For example, there is a famous tale about a meeting between Euler and Diderot at the Russian court.  Eves includes De Morgan's early version of the story and compares it to his source, Thiebault, concluding that, sadly, the anecdote as it's usually told is mostly wishful thinking.  There are also some notes on odds and ends--the origin of the word &quot;sine&quot; was new to me.<br />If you like popular mathematics books you'll have heard quite a few of these before, but many will still be new to you. My own favourites are the last few in the book, about Norbert Wiener, the famously absent-minded MIT professor.  Here's one, to give you the flavour: one day Wiener was asked in class how to do a certain problem.  &quot;He thought for a moment, then wrote the answer on the blackboard.  The class was nonplussed, and finally a bold spirit asked, 'But, Professor Wiener, is there any other way to do the problem?'  The professor thought again for a moment, then brightened up and said, 'Why, yes, there *is* another way.'  Then he wrote the same answer on the board.&quot;...  However, it's a fine book, and if money is no object I can assure you you'll enjoy it.	2001-01-20

Constance Reid, who also wrote a biography of Hilbert's student Courant, initially ran into some resistance from Hilbert's associates when she started work on this book.  Max Born was not keen on the idea of a woman, who was neither German nor a mathematician, writing a study of Hilbert's life.  Born was enthusiastic about the final product, however, and it has become a classic.<br />Hilbert took over from Poincare the title of the most famous mathematician in the world.  His mathematical achievements are numerous and varied; Reid does a good job of providing an overview of the impact Hilbert had on many different fields, and of his style; his strengths and weaknesses.  There is a good deal of coverage of the famous twenty-three Hilbert problems, presented to the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900, including a large section of the talk Hilbert gave.<br />Reid paints a vivid picture of the mathematical circle at Gottingen, a luminous collection of talents.  Minkowski and Hilbert were close friends; Klein was the director of the institute there; Emmy Noether was there; Hurwitz; Zermelo; Landau; the list is long and impressive.  It's all the more sad to read about the way the Institute was destroyed by the Nazis in the name of racial purity.  Almost without exception the leading mathematicians emigrated, one by one, to America.  Hilbert, who had retired in 1930 (retirement at age 68 was mandatory) was forced to watch as the work of decades was dismantled.  The last years, of age, fading memory and the privations of war, are mercifully given less than a dozen pages.<br />Hilbert's life leads from the great days of the mid-nineteenth century to the Nazis and the atomic bomb.  Reid has done a wonderful job of capturing the feel of Germany over his long life, and the mathematic impact and importance of his work.  A compulsory book for those interested inmodern mathematical history.	2001-01-20

Her mother has just died at the start of the book, but her forceful character looms over the plot, gaining importance as Toni realizes she has inherited some of her mother's magic.  It's an unwelcome gift though: the &quot;riders&quot; are something like ancestral spirits, except that it's not clear they give a hoot about Toni's well-being--most of the time, anyway.  They take over Toni's body, as they did her mother's, whenever they feel like it.<br />This is not fundamentally a book about magic, though, or about multiple personalities, though it has a little of that feel.  It's about Toni learning to cope with life; coping with her sister, with her love-life; with her job, and most of all with the memories of her mother.  Stewart doesn't put a foot wrong with his characterization of Toni; a remarkable feat for a man and a sign of his skill.  The writing is clean and clear, and frequently very funny.<br />However, in some ways I think the book is a failure.  I think Stewart wanted Mockingbird to be meaningful and deep.  He was aiming at being Isabel Allende, but in the end I think he only achieves humour, affection and interest.  It feels a little unfair to criticize the book for not being brilliant, but I think Stewart can do even better than this.  Meanwhile, this is a fine novel, and I unhesitatingly recommend it.	2001-01-20

The story takes place in four time periods; around 71 AD in the Roman Empire; 870 AD in Britain in the Dark Ages; 1358 in northern France; and finally 2028 in America--this last section accounting for over half of the book.<br />Vitellan captures your sympathy pretty quickly.  He's sharp, tough, and sympathetic, and it's easy for a reader to care about his misfortunes.  Which is a good thing because the plot is a bit too episodic--the first two sections have almost no plot consequences for the last two; we don't meet the major bad guy until almost halfway through the book; and the love interest (a very odd subplot) is also a late arrival.  The result is the book feels like two or three long stories cobbled together into a novel.<br />Having said that, the book is worth reading.  The historical sections are rather better than the 21st century sequences, which read like rehashed Neal Stephenson--lots of action and plenty of high-tech gimmickry.  The section set in 71 AD, in particular, is well done; especially the part dealing with the Temporians' fortress.<br />This is worth a try if you like historical sf; it's not going to become a classic, though.	2001-01-20

Hadamard, a world-class mathematician best known for his proof of the prime number theorem in 1896, wrote this in the 40's, basing it on correspondence with many of the great living mathematicians of his time.  The actual questions he posed are preserved in an appendix.<br />Most of his respondents were mathematicians (and he limited his correspondence to the best minds in the field), but he did get information from several other fields, and cites data about physicists (a letter from Einstein forms another appendix), chemists, physiologists, metaphysicians, and so on.  What he is trying to examine is a slippery subject, perhaps best explained by a quote.  Here is a discussion of Sidgwick, an economist: &quot;His reasonings on economic questions were almost always accompanied by images, and the images were often curiously arbitrary and sometimes almost undecipherably symbolic.  For example, it took him a long time to discover that an odd symbolic image which accompanied the word 'value' was a faint, partial image of a man putting something on a scale.&quot;<br />Hadamard gives his own mental images that accompany his following through the steps of Euclid's famous proof of the infinitude of primes.  I won't reproduce that here for space reasons, but the contrast with Sidgwick's--and with other reports of mental activity--is fascinating.  Many other examples are given, from Mozart to Polya to Galton to Poincare. Hadamard makes it clear that language and thought are not the same thing, contrary to a commonly expressed view among linguists.  He cites Max Muller's comments equating thought and language, and acknowledges that for Muller it may be so, but convincingly demonstrates, by quoting numerous other mathematicians, that it is not true for everyone.  The further conclusion, that the process of creative thought, while following similar patterns in similar discipline, can vary dramatically, is as far as Hadamard can go with the data he has.<br />One other note: this book was retitled &quot;The Mathematician's Mind&quot; and republished in the Princeton Science Library series; it's not immediately clear from the Amazon page that this is so.  The Dover edition is substantially cheaper.<br />A fascinating and informative book.	2001-01-16

The majority are of museum specimens, which oddly is what makes the pictures so attractive: we're used to seeing high quality pictures of wildlife, but the displays here juxtapose many different beetles and have more impact than wildlife shots would.<br />The pictures are beautiful but the text is high-quality too.  The authors start by reciting some statistics on the number of beetle species.  Linnaeus, two hundred and fifty years ago, described 654 species; and Fabricius added another 4,112 species between 1775 and 1801.  By 1876 Gemminger and von Harold's catalog contained nearly 77,000 species; and when Junk and Schenkling's catalogue was completed, in 1940, it listed nearly 221,500 species.  It's now estimated that there are 350,000 described beetle species.  However, recent work by Terry Erwin, extrapolating from detailed studies of a small area, suggests that there are more than eight *million* species of beetle just in the tropics!<br />The rest of the book is a fairly detailed survey of beetles in all their aspects.  The authors are enthusiasts as well as experts, and it shows in their writing, which is crisp, clear and engaging.  They cover beetle anatomy, fossilized beetles, habitats and niches, the beetle life cycle, and mimicry.  There is also substantial coverage of beetles and humans: naming, appearance in mythology, use as jewels (really!), a discussion of pest control, and use in education.  The book has more scientific depth than is usual for a coffee table book, without sacrificing interest value.<br />There is a website that appears to be maintained by one of the authors (Evans) that contains some material from the book; I recommend you take a look if you are hesitating about buying this.  I found it by searching for the book title using a standard search engine; when I looked it was on the Lorquin Entomological Society's website, but it may have moved.<br />Recommended.	2001-01-16

Not all the pictures are flawless--anyone who's ever photographed birds knows how hard it is to get a good, detailed, well-lit close-up shot--but they are very high quality and make this both a gorgeous coffee table book and a valuable identification aid.<br />The coverage is not as complete as, say, Peterson's Field Guide to the Birds of Texas, which I also own.  The Peterson has, for example, many more of the confusing fall warblers; the Tveten explicitly says that detailed coverage of the warblers is outside its scope.  But the differences in coverage are generally of the rarer birds; anything a casual bird-watcher is likely to see will be in the Tveten; and the Peterson has few good colour plates.<br />This is a larger book than is really convenient out in the field, though.  Plus the descriptive sections, while well-written and interesting, aren't organized in a way that makes it easy to quickly find important field marks or check the range.  If you want to get just one book I'd recommend this one; get another for completeness or for use in the field.	2001-01-14

Where appropriate he also has sections for voice and nest.  The emphasis on field identification is good, with additional sections showing, for example, silhouettes of accipiters, falcons, kites and harriers to show the differences.<br />However, many of the plates are black and white, or line drawings, and this is a significant drawback.  For that reason I'd recommend John Tveten's The Birds of Texas instead, although it's not as handy out in the field, and has less coverage of casuals and accidentals.  The organization of the Peterson is good enough that you might want to get both.	2001-01-14

Francis Crawford is an Elizabethan James Bond; dashing, capable, scintillating in conversation and deadly in battle.  His character is engaging and his relationships with the other characters are the highlight of the book.  But the plot itself is  difficult to follow; in addition to requiring close attention, it really helps to know a fair amount about the political landscape of Scotland in 1547.  And the prose is sometimes smooth, and sometimes opaque.  Dunnett likes complicated similes, which I suspect are a matter of taste--here's an example, where she describes a voice rising above a hubbub: &quot;An anonymous voice skirling through the din gave it its leitmotif.&quot; Or a fight scene: &quot;His chin hit the blue tiles like a pharmacist's pestle; he tried, swimmily, to roll over and found himself pinned by a relentless matrix of bones.&quot;  I could have handled the prose, but combined with the difficulty of following the complex and elliptically described plot it was just too much for me.<br />The numerous positive reviews lead me to believe the underlying story is exciting and fun to read, if you enjoy Dunnett's style.  My advice is to pick up a copy and read two or three pages before you buy it, however; the negative reviews, though less frequent, make it apparent I'm not alone in finding this hard to read--and you may have trouble with it too.	2001-01-13

However, this is not an &quot;Illuminatus&quot; novel; there is no conspiracy to take over the world here; no secret cabal controlling presidents and monarchs; no &quot;Protocol of the Elders of Zion&quot;.  This is a business, and they just want to make money.  Of course they do it on scale that even General Motors might envy; much of the book's plot turns on their desire to get a seat at the UN by getting control of one of the tinier nations.  (Quite openly, and with the agreement of that nation's government.)<br />The protagonist is Kathryn Telman, adopted into the business at an early age, and now, at 38, a rising executive with a sharp eye for company politics and a strong sense of ethics.  She is faced with several ethical choices in &quot;The Business&quot;, and she makes, by and large, intelligent decisions.  However, the book is also, in a quiet way, a political thriller, and though there are no actual dead bodies, there is certainly some skulduggery for Kathryn to get to the bottom of.<br />One of Banks' greatest assets is his ability to weld a good story to a worthwhile problem, and tell the whole thing entertainingly.  &quot;The Business&quot; is no exception.  It's not his best book: I'd recommend &quot;The Bridge&quot; or &quot;Complicity&quot; if you want to start somewhere else, or &quot;The Player of Games&quot; if you like science fiction; but it's a fine, smooth, and thought-provoking read.	2001-01-05

Bentley spent fifty years painstakingly recording snowflakes, frost, rime, sleet and ice in all its forms.  Even before &quot;Snow Crystals&quot; was published in 1931, his work was well known, and so popular that eventually a donor provided the (apparently large) amount of money needed to assemble this beautiful collection.<br />There is a small amount of text at the front of the book, which is moderately interesting.  It contains a description of how to take these pictures for yourself, if you'd like to; and a classification of the kinds of snowflake and other ice forms depicted here.  The bulk of the book, however, is made up of well over two thousand black and white photographs, the vast majority of them of single snowflakes.  You can get an idea of what they look like by clicking on Amazon's image of the cover picture, above; in the book, the images are white on black.  You may also want to visit snowflakebentley.com, which contains more examples, and more information about Bentley himself (there is almost none in this book).  In most or all cases, Bentley went to the trouble of making a duplicate negative of each snowflake and then cutting out, by hand, the finely detailed image, so that the background to the picture would be pure black.<br />The results are spectacular.  The snowflakes are ethereally beautiful, and the variety is just stunning.  However, in case it's not clear from what I've said so far, this is a contemplative book.  It's not a book to read: it's a book to browse through, put away, and get out again another snowy day.  Children will like it, but just to glance at, not to go through steadily.<br />Recommended.	2001-01-05

Banks has done a fair job of putting together interesting essays on various topics, though he's frankly not a very good writer.<br />His topics do a lot of the work for him, though.  For example, he spends a couple of chapters on the engineering problems associated with towing and melting a large iceberg to provide fresh water.  It's neat to watch him make his way through one question after another: what's the great-circle distance from the Antarctic to Los Angeles?  When you stop towing it, how long till it coasts to a stop?  How do you melt it?  Can you get useful energy out of the heat difference between it and its surroundings?  Banks' ease with numbers is contagious, and reading this one can see just how powerful applied mathematics is, and how many questions you can ask--and answer.<br />However, it's not for everyone.  I have a pure maths degree, and am not particularly scared of a differential equation, but I found myself skimming the innumerable equations and calculations.  Which is OK: you can just let your eyes glaze over at the symbols and still pick up the narrative.  You'll get the idea of what can be done; you just won't really understand how.  But this is not really a book to teach people who don't already know these techniques.  It's a fun book if you already like maths, and a terrific book if you enjoy engineering calculations, but it's not likely to make many converts.<br />One extra point I'd like to make: a couple of times, Banks brings up a really interesting idea that highlights very effectively just how powerful and surprising mathematics can be.  My favourite is the calculation of the economic energy of a nation, which is an offshoot of Banks' analysis of the success of smaller nations at getting Olympic medals (interestingly, Cuba is by far the most successful Olympic nation according to his numbers).  Let P be a nation's population in millions, and G the gross domestic product in billions of US dollars.  Then E, the economic energy of a nation, is (PG^2)/2, or one half times P times G squared.  This is analogous in form to the standard equation for kinetic energy, with population substituted for mass, and GDP for velocity.  Banks goes on to present a whole series of analogies between the two fields, and calculates comparisons of economic power, energy and momentum for the US, Europe and elsewhere.  It's a fascinating excursion.<br />I've only given the book three stars, partly because Banks' style, while endearing, is awfully clunky, and partly because the book has such a very narrow appeal.  But if you know what a differential equation is, if you think it's interesting to try out calculations and compare results, and particularly if you enjoy seeing just what the engineering mindset can do, you should give this a try.	2001-01-05

It taught me, and tens of thousands of other children, that a &quot;sense of wonder&quot; is something you can get from science, as well as from science fiction.  I found it in a bookstore seven or eight years ago, and was immediately transported back to when I first read it, in my school library, at the age of ten.  I was swept off my feet at ten years old, and the book can still sweep me off my feet today.<br />The original film was potent too; more so in the directness with which it expresses the scale of the world.  But the book, with its annotations and additional pictures, has its own power.  You can flip back and forth, and take as much time as you want absorbing the incredible range of scale in the universe.<br />The book's first picture is scaled at about a billion light years across--ten to the twenty-fifth metres.  On this scale even super-clusters of galaxies are just clots of dust on a black background.  The right hand side of each page, as you go through the book, zooms in by a factor of ten, and we dive into galaxy clusters, into our galaxy, our spiral arm, our solar system, through the moon's orbit and into the earth's atmosphere, down into North America, and then Chicago, and a picnicker asleep in a park.  After twenty five pages we're at a human scale; the pictured scene is a metre across.  But the camera continues to zoom in; to the picnicker's hand, through his skin to a lymphocyte, and on down through the cell nucleus to coils of DNA, to a carbon atom and through its electron cloud, and down to the nucleus and beyond.  Sixteen pages from the picnicker have brought us to the quarks.<br />The left hand side of each page provides companion pictures and comments, some drawn from the history of science.  For the nanometre picture there's a copy of John Dalton's two-hundred-year-old models of simple molecules; at the millimetre and tenth-millimetre scale there are pictures of radiolaria, seeds, and other microscopic beauties.  All are interesting and informative.<br />I can't recommend this book too strongly--it's a fundamental work of scientific culture, and should be in every house.  However, I particularly recommend that you buy this for any nine-to-fourteen-year-old child in your life; it's the best way I know to introduce a child to a love of science.	2001-01-01

The six chapters cover number theory, set theory, calculus, group theory and topology; but to state it baldly like this is to miss the main value of this seductively illustrated book.  Devlin titles his chapters innocuously--&quot;Shape&quot;, or &quot;Position&quot;--and the initial discussion, couched generally in English, not mathematics, is so clear that a math-phobic can understand it.  By the end of each chapter a great deal of fascinating mathematics has been described, and in some cases the formal basis is sketched--but the emphasis is always on narration, and a lay reader who doesn't even want to understand mathematics can still read this and get a sense of the dramatic history of mathematics.  And of the dramatis personae, too; one nice feature is the large number of good pictures of mathematicians, including several more recent figures such as Ribet and Thurston.<br />Devlin states at the end that he decided to exclude many areas of mathematics in order to focus more effectively on what he did cover. As a result there is little or no coverage of chaos theory, game theory, catastrophe theory, or a long list of other topics.  The fact is there will always be holes in a book this size--mathematics has expanded so much in the last hundred years that even a book ten times this size could barely survey it.  The decision to focus was a good one, and the subjects chosen are good: the truly exciting stories are here: Archimedes, Fermat, Gauss, Galois, Riemann, Wiles, and many more.<br />The illustrations deserve an extra comment.  I've already mentioned the pictures of mathematicians.  There are good diagrams, of the quality you'd expect from Scientific American.  There are also plenty of pictures of the sort you see in every maths book of this kind--Escher tessellations, Kepler's nested Platonic solids, a Durer perspective drawing.  But there are several more that I've never seen (and I've read a lot of these books).  Two notable pictures: a cardboard model of an aperiodic tiling of space, by John Conway; and a picture of a set of tiles at a Dutch high school, designed by Escher: I'm an Escher fan and have never seen these before.<br />Potential purchasers should note, by the way, that this book was reworked into Devlin's &quot;Language of Mathematics&quot;.  In Devlin's words (not from either book): &quot;The Language of Mathematics is a restructuring of Science of Patterns that omits most of the color illustrations (a minus) but has two new chapters covering topics not in Science of Patterns (a plus). If you want lots of color, go for patterns; Language of Mathematics covers more ground.&quot;<br />This is a fine book.  Strongly recommended.	2000-12-31

Recommended.	&quot;The Math Gene&quot;  presents a theory of how mathematical ability and language are related, and how they might have evolved.  Devlin starts by separating &quot;number sense&quot; from mathematical ability.  Many animals as well as humans can estimate the quantity of something; rats can be taught to press a lever about sixteen times to get a reward.  The &quot;about&quot; is significant though; it's an estimate, not an exact count, as far as the rats are concerned.  So if number sense and mathematical ability are not the same, what else is needed for mathematics?  Devlin lists eight other attributes, including algorithmic ability, a sense of cause and effect, and relational reasoning ability.<br />Then there's a fairly long discussion of mathematics from the inside--are mathematician's brains different?  What is it mathematicians do?--including a moderately detailed description of the basics of mathematical groups.  I think Devlin does this to provide non-mathematicians with a sense of what mathematics is about, to make the rest of the book more plausible.  This section is well-written and fluent, but I found myself getting a little impatient for the meat of his argument, which comes in the last half of the book.  I suspect any reader with a good mathematics background would react the same way.<br />The next piece of the argument is to demonstrate that language is unlikely to have developed solely as a result of evolutionary pressure towards communication.  This is a subtle point I haven't seen made before, but Devlin (who acknowledges his debts to other workers in this area) makes the case quite convincing.  In summary: apart from extremely simple messages like &quot;Danger!&quot; and &quot;Mammoth here&quot; you can't communicate what you don't have a mental representation of.  The evolution of communication can't have driven representation; it must have always lagged a half-step behind.  So mental representation must have evolved first.  I am not doing thisargument justice here, but Devlin buttresses it well.<br />The inference is that language is simply a natural but lucky result of our ability to represent the world in our minds.  Devlin's key point, however, is that since mathematics is essentially the ability to construct and work with increasingly abstract representations, the same mental changes that gave rise to language have also given rise to mathematics.  His conclusion is that we all have the ability to do mathematics: there is no &quot;math gene&quot; except in the same way there is a &quot;language gene&quot;: it's universal.<br />As a side note, not critical to his main argument, he points out that the most likely reason for the growth of representational ability in human brains was to foster understanding of other humans in the group; to encourage a sense of group-ness.  For a creature that was more effective in group actions (e.g. hunting) there would have been a strong evolutionary advantage to having an emotional investment in the success of the group.  Hence much of the early use of this ability would have been to represent others in the group; when language was added, it would have enabled people to talk about each other.  In Devlin's words, &quot;Having arisen as a side-effect of off-line thinking, language was immediately hijacked to facilitate gossip.&quot;  (Off-line thinking is used to mean representational thinking that doesn't result in or from actions in the immediate environment.)<br />Two particular items in the book are worth mentioning.  One is a followup to some famous experiments done by child psychologist Piaget in the 1930's.  Piaget thought he'd demonstrated that children don't acquire a fully-developed number sense till around six years old. More recent work has demonstrated that children are much smarter than Piaget realized: there was a subtle and fascinating methodological flaw in Piaget's experiment.  The second item is a little test of logical reasoning, presented with fourcards on a table.  Even mathematicians, who will probably get the test right, may be surprised at the coda to the test, which forms one of the few methods of direct verification of Devlin's claim that everyone can do mathematics.<br />The case is well-argued, but one problem with theories like these is that there *are* so few ways of finding out if they're true.  &quot;The Math Gene&quot; is reminiscent of Julian Jaynes' &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; in this way; a fascinating argument that we may never be able to test.  However, it's thought-provoking and plausible, and left me, at least, convinced of its likely truth.	2000-12-31
US	52748657	R1FV6G48E27NAW	0140440399	872483286	History of the Peloponnesian War	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Brilliant and absorbing; could do with more annotation	In 431 BC war broke out between Athens, the dominant empire in Greece at the time, and Sparta, her main rival.  The first twenty years of the war are chronicled in this absorbing work: book eight breaks off mid-sentence, and Thucydides' account of the last seven years of the war has not survived.<br />Apart from fifteen pages in book one, in which he briefly recounts the events of the fifty years prior to the war, Thucydides never strays from the day-to-day and year-to-year details of the war.  The only significant Greek historian who predates him is Herodotus, whose account ended where Thucydides' begins, in 479 BC; but Herodotus was a story-teller where Thucydides is a scholar.  Reading Herodotus' &quot;Histories&quot; is more like sitting by the fire with a glass of brandy and an interesting friend.  Thucydides reads like a textbook, and though this is one of his strengths, it also makes him a little harder for modern readers to approach.  On the other hand, the very density of information feels quite modern, so that although the politics is alien, once you find your feet you'll be swept up by the story of a terrible war.<br />The book is full of names, places, and account of battles and intrigues.  There are several maps at the back, which are a great help, but over and over again I found that a key place wasn't on the map, and there are no notes to help out. Where is Naupactus?  Who are the Carians?  Where do the Illyrians come from?  Unlike the Penguin edition of Herodotus, which is packed with helpful notes, this edition provides the reader very little help.  Too often I found I just had to wing it, guessing the importance of a name or the approximate location of a place from context.  I'd recommend having a good classical dictionary handy while you read, if you're the sort who wants these questions answered.<br />Thucydides style is to alternate plain narration with speeches.  The introduction (by Finley) makes it clear that these speeches are generally madeup by Thucydides to fit what he thought would or should have been said.  On the other hand, he was there for some of them, and did his best to interview eye-witnesses wherever he could, so the speeches tend to sound quite convincing.<br />Thucydides' passion for accuracy is what makes this book special.  The account of a night battle in Sicily makes it clear how hard he worked to get the details right; he comments that this account is less likely to be accurate because the witnesses he interviewed were unable to see the whole battlefield, as they could in a day battle, and there's a fascinating chapter (book seven, chapter 44) where he talks about all the difficulties of reporting factually in these circumstances.<br />He sounds quite modern, and he is.  He's the first truly modern historian, and would be worth reading for that reason alone.  However, the story he tells, of twenty years of bitter conflict between two fine civilizations, is enthralling, and brilliantly told.  Recommended.	2000-12-26

It's true that this is one of this book's charms, but I found something more to be prized.  The &quot;Treasury&quot; is exactly what it claims to be: a treasury of the hundreds of songs you're familiar with but don't know by heart, and don't know where to look up.<br />Everyone will have their own list of works they think they'll never find again.  Here's a partial list of mine; perhaps some of these are ones you're hunting for too: Langdon Smith's &quot;Evolution&quot; (When you were a tadpole and I was a fish/In the Paleozoic time); Oliver Wendell Holmes' &quot;The One-Hoss Shay&quot;; Robert Service's &quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee&quot;; Henley's &quot;Invictus&quot; (source of &quot;I am the captain of my soul&quot;).  And dozens more.<br />I found much I didn't care for here, but much more I did.  This is truly a remarkable collection.  It belongs on every bookshelf, if only because you'll never find another source for so many of the poems within it.  Buy it; you'll discover a lot of old friends here.	2000-12-26
US	52748657	R1KDG817F4PW8V	006105903X	589672323	Moonseed	Books	3	6	7	N	N	The science is better than the plot	Twenty five or so years ago, you never saw books like this.  Moonseed is a traditional science fiction disaster novel, but it's been written in a mainstream style, presumably for marketing reasons.  What we have here is &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, except that it's the earth that's sinking.<br />The lead character, Henry Meacher, is a geologist.  When a nano-threat from the Moon starts collapsing the Earth's crust and causing increasing vulcanism he is on the scene and soon becomes part of the race for a solution.  His ex-wife, colleagues and acquaintances form more of the cast.  There are dozens of viewpoint characters; each followed till they die horribly or reach safety (safety being something that changes its definition as the book progresses).  The plot suffers a little from data-hiding--Baxter can't tell you what Henry's great plan is, because then the last couple of hundred pages are little more than the playing out of the idea.  And in fact that happens anyway--the last thirty pages are subtitled every dozen paragraphs: &quot;A year later&quot;, &quot;Ten years later&quot; and so on, as Baxter traces down the results of Henry's mission.  Not a terrible ending, but not a very satisfying climax either.<br />The science is neat, and as another reviewer said here one wishes he'd done more of it.  Baxter is clearly very knowledgeable about the space program, and we get page after page of detail about technology that exists now--when a character goes up to the Space Station it takes forty pages to get from launch to where they're going.  I'm not saying it's boring, but that section is going to be a hit only if you're a real space buff.<br />Apart from problems like that with the pacing, though, the book is a good hard science techno-thriller.  Baxter does a more than competent job with the characters, and the gradual breakdown of the earth's geological stability is lovingly detailed and very convincing, and rises on occasion to the sense of wonder found inbooks like Greg Bear's The Forge of God.  Not an unconditional recommendation, but worth a try if you like sf disaster novels.	2000-12-03

Leonardo da Vinci became interested in mechanics and science, not art; the Medici are not returned to power in Florence, and indeed Savonarola is still alive; and Machiavelli (spelled Machiavegli here), instead of falling from favour when the Medici return, as happened in our world, is brought down from power by the suspicion that he is a Medici sympathizer.<br />However, a reduced Machiavegli has opportunities he did not have in our world.  Da Vinci's focus on science has brought Renaissance Florence technologies from the printing press to engines of war, and Machiavegli has become a journalist.<br />The protagonist, Pasquale, is a young artist, and art is big business and major politics in this world.  A major figure is murdered, and Pasquale and Machiavegli get on the tracks of a conspiracy.  Pretty soon the conspiracy is on to them, and the book is a fairly straightforward thriller after that.<br />The period detail is good, and the ways in which the new technologies have changed and yet not changed the world are well-imagined.  The characters occasionally sound more like twentieth century actors wearing period costumes, but McAuley maintains the tone pretty well, and he's a clean, transparent writer, without clumsiness or affectation.<br />On the plot level, there are a couple of implausibilities.  When you finally find out how the locked room murder was committed, a couple of fairly serious problems with the explanation will doubtless occur to you as they did to me.  The conspiracy does seem a little hydra-headed and all-seeing; in places the book starts to sound like Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;, and not in a good way.  But Pasquale is a good character, and the book is a satisfying though not exceptional read.	2000-12-02

Then we get more viewpoints: Angelica Elizalde, a psychiatrist who had a disastrous seance a few years ago; Sherman Oaks, who seems at first just to be a crazy homeless person; Solomon Shadroe, a strange L.A. landlord who has some long ago connection to Sullivan's boss, Loretta deLarava; Neal Obstadt, who still works with deLarava.<br />It's a little too much.  The stories eventually entwine, but to start with almost all these threads are separate, and it's difficult to keep track.  It may be more of a problem if you read the book in twenty or thirty page chunks, as I did, instead of sitting down for a couple of hours at a time and absorbing large parts of it.<br />Having said that, the story is strong and interesting, with well-drawn characters and a helter-skelter ghostly denouement on the moored luxury liner, Queen Mary.  The internal logic of &quot;Expiration Date&quot;, where ghosts are visible to some people, is perfectly done.  In this world some people have become addicted to absorbing--&quot;eating&quot;--ghosts; snorting them up like powdered cocaine, swallowing up their essences.  This unpleasant habit drives much of the book, though you're halfway through before you start to piece all the information together.  As a result the first half of the book is a little dream-like, with so many disconnected storylines, and so much unexplained weirdness.<br />The book works, in the end, and is a fun read.  But it really doesn't need to be over 500 pages.	2000-10-30
US	52748657	RQ1NGXY162SGV	0345435249	147883919	Darwin's Radio	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Great science, good characters; could be shorter and tauter	Kaye Lang, the heroine of Darwin's Radio, is a world-class microbiologist, whose ideas about unusual genetic influences on evolution become relevant when Herod's flu strikes, causing hundreds of thousands of miscarriages.  She is one of the few who suspect that it's not just a disease, and is soon caught up in political fights as the US government tries to understand the disease--a kind of retrovirus--and find a cure.  The science is well-researched and very believable, and the characters are well-drawn.<br />So why only three stars?  Partly it's just that the book is too long, as several other reviewers have noted below.  Kaye's relationship with Saul Lang takes up perhaps fifty or sixty pages out of the first two hundred, but is almost never referred to thereafter.  Bear must have put this in to round out Kaye's character, but it seems unnecessary to the plot or to our sense of who Kaye is.  The few connections Saul's actions have to the rest of the plot could have been done just as well in many fewer words.<br />The sections about the politics and science of the surgeon general's office are also too long, though since this is the lens through which Bear focusses on Washington politics it's an essential part of the thriller.  However, the ending of the book throws all this preparatory material away; Bear abandons all the standard techno-thriller machinery he has gone to so much trouble to set up, and the reader follows Kaye away to a different kind of ending altogether.<br />Kaye Lang is a good character, and her life and work are what make this book as good as it is.  But Bear's decision to write the book as a techno-thriller, when it could have been done more simply just as Kaye's story, seems to me to be a critical mistake.  It's a mark of how good a writer Bear is that this mixture is as powerful as it is.	2000-10-15

Then there are four sections, one for June 29, 1863, and three covering the battle itself, July 1 through July 3.<br />&quot;The Killer Angels&quot; is written as if it were a novel, and this is its strength.  Stuart, scouting with the cavalry, was late back to Lee with little information, and this is often cited in the history books as a key point in the battle: Lee did not know to start with just how many Yankees he was facing.  Shaara makes this come alive: we see Lee in his tent, worrying about where Stuart is; we hear gossip about court-martialing Stuart; we walk with Longstreet, thinking black thoughts about Stuart's irresponsibility.  Time and again key points become vivid and unforgettable when seen through the lens of fiction.  Pickett's charge; Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top; Reynolds' death; Longstreet's urging of a defensive stance.<br />The book contains material that is invented by Shaara.  He went to great pains to make it accurate, but he says in the introduction: &quot;I have not consciously changed any fact.  I have condensed some of the action, for the sake of clarity, and eliminated some minr characters, for brevity, but [. . .] I have not knowingly violated the action.&quot;  The book can't be used as a reference work on the battle.  However, if you read it, the battle will be etched in your memory in a way that no dry textbook could ever achieve.<br />Powerfully written, and highly recommended.	2000-10-14

The first, a commentary on Grimm's Fairy Tales, is a good historical overview of the field of folktale research.  Campbell ends it by touching on some of the topics that interest him in the rest of the book--archetypes, myths as repositories of wisdom, the genesis and dissemination of folklore and myth.  He ends it by saying: &quot;The folk tale is the primer of the picture-language of the soul&quot;, a gnomic utterance that I can't quite decode.<br />The rest of the book varies between these two poles: good historical overview and fascinating data on folk tales and myths, and complex, blurry statements about shamanic wisdom and human nature.  One essay analyzes a specific American Indian tale in great detail; others delve into psychoanalysis and religious practice.  I found all of them frustrating.  I kept looking for a clear statement of what Campbell believes, and I couldn't find it.<br />I was recommended this book by a friend who really likes both it and Campbell.  I went back to him and asked him to explain what Campbell was saying.  After I spoke to him I think I got it, but I have a low opinion of the clarity of Campbell's writing.  It shouldn't be that hard!<br />As for the content, I'll refrain from making judgements, and simply say that Campbell's primary interest--if I understand him correctly--is in the relationship between the huge body of myth worldwide, and human nature.  His language is sometimes mystical--a word he dislikes; but here's a sentence of his: &quot;The shaman, then, is not only a familiar denizen, but even the favoured scion, of those realms of power that are invisible to our normal waking consciousness, which all may visit briefly in vision, but through which he roams, a master.&quot;  It's very hard to tell whether this is his transcription of the shaman's viewpoint, or whether Campbell believes there really are &quot;realms of power&quot;. This ambiguity pervades the book, and I suspect is why he is often referred to as mystical.<br />Overall, I can't recommend the book, unless you are already familiar with Campbell's ideas.  If you're not, I think you'd find it as frustrating as I did.	2000-10-13

This book has seven more, from around the  world--Paraguay, Australia, Ghana, the U.S. (a Navajo string figure), New  Guinea, Alaska, and Ireland.  Each is accompanied by photographs of the  children who taught Johnson the figures, and good detailed diagrams of how  to make the figures.<br />The presentation is more spectacular than in  &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;, but when you get down to it the figures are what  counts, and these are no more fun than the first book.  In fact, they're a  little more difficult to learn.  We bought this for our five year old  daughter, who'd enjoyed the first book (despite one of the patterns being  too difficult for her); she found this one much less interesting.  I think  an older child would like the extra details about the children in the  different countries, however.<br />I'd recommend that you buy &quot;Cat's  Cradle&quot; first.  If you or the child you buy it for enjoys it, this is  a good follow up gift, but it doesn't have anything as easy to learn and  fun as Cup and Saucer or Witch's Broom, from the first book.	2000-09-19
US	52748657	R1S7CVRB9W60CO	006099486X	418849151	The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of The Oxford English Dictionary	Books	3	110	120	N	N	Interesting and well-researched, but a bit melodramatic	James Murray, the editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, corresponded  with Dr. W.C. Minor for many years; Dr. Minor was one of the most  indefatigable contributors to the OED.  Minor was committed to an Broadmoor  asylum in 1872, having murdered an innocent man.  Nowadays we would call  him a paranoid schizophrenic; in those days they just called him  insane.<br />In the asylum he had plenty of time to locate and submit  thousands of usage slips to the OED, and thus began his relationship with  Murray.  It is an extraordinary relationship, and Winchester wrings every  last drop of melodrama from it--to the point of irritating the  reader.<br />For example, for many years there was a standard tale about the  first meeting of Murray and Minor, in which Murray only finds out when he  actually arrives at Broadmoor that Dr. Minor is not on the staff, but is an  inmate.  Winchester opens the book with the phrase &quot;Popular myth has  it that . . . &quot; and proceeds to tell the tale; it is an engaging  story, and he tells it well.  However, halfway through the book he points  out that it is false, and has been known to be so for several years.  He  does eventually give the true version of events, but dangling the  attractive lie in front of the reader like this while delaying the less  exciting truth is a sign of his weakness for sensationalism.<br />Another  example (p. 195 in the paperback edition): after describing a particular  gruesome episode of his madness, Winchester speculates for a whole page  about a possible cause for which there is not even a hint of evidence--that  Minor had an affair with the wife of the man he murdered.  Winchester  freely admits this is a complete fabrication, but includes it as  &quot;legitimate speculation&quot;; to me, it feels more like tabloid  journalism.<br />There's more of the same, but that's enough examples; I think  part of the problem is that there is simply not much material here to work  with.  The basic facts are few, and Winchester had to embroider and  imagine.  It must be said, though, that where he *does* relate factual  information, as opposed to speculation, the book is fascinating.  The story  truly is remarkable, and despite the style is very much worth reading.   It's just a pity that Winchester felt unable to let the story speak for  itself.	2000-09-15
US	52748657	R133ZYGVMFI1CW	0932592007	273788217	Juggling for the Complete Klutz	Books	5	5	5	N	N	It's really true--this book can teach ANYONE to juggle	I learnt to juggle in the early 80's from this book, and since then I've bought it for half a dozen friends aged from 9 to 40, and recommended it to  dozens more.  I'm as klutzy as they come: no coordination, awkward, two  left feet--but this book had me juggling in thirty minutes.  No kidding.   Only three or four tosses, but I was hooked, and by the end of the week my  back ached (from picking up dropped balls!) and I could juggle for as long  as I wanted.<br />Cassidy and Rimbeaux give four basic steps to learning: The  Drop, The Toss, The Exchange, and The Jug.  As they make clear, the toss  and exchange are really all there is to it.  The fact is that juggling  three balls is *much* more straightforward than it seems, and this book  does a terrific job of breaking it down into pieces in such a way that it  seems obvious.  Last week I bought a copy for the son of a friend of mine,  and the clerk asked me if the book was good.  By the time she'd finished  running my credit card, I'd explained to her the basic steps.  It really is  that simple.<br />It's that simple, and this book can take a lot of the credit  for making it that simple.  Oh, there's more in the book than those four  steps--they talk about common problems, how to juggle four and even five  balls, juggling with two people, and lots of cool tricks.  But the fun part  is getting those first three balls up there, and keeping them  there.<br />Actually the fact that there's so much about tricks in a 75 page  book tells you there's not much to learn to juggle three balls.  All you  need to know you get in the first 20 pages.  But it will keep you (and your  friends!) entertained for the rest of your life.	2000-08-17

I bought it not that long after I moved to  Texas, and it was a welcome companion--it was nice to read in print what  I'd just found out the hard way in conversation, and even nicer to be  forewarned.<br />Moss has included most, but not all, of the words that  frequently baffle one side or the other.  On the plus side, there are some  wonderful anecdotes in here--such as one in the &quot;Yankee&quot; entry,  about a Brit who mentioned to his Tennessee hosts that he'd seen a lot of  Yankee money and enterprise down in Mexico, to be greeted by a cool silence  and finally the resentful retort: &quot;Well, I bet there's some rebel  money and rebel enterprise down there too.&quot;  If you don't understand  what the problem was, you need this book.<br />On the other side of the  ledger, however, the book is incomplete.  Naturally it is missing some very  recent slang, such as the very new British use of &quot;pants&quot; as a  synonym for &quot;naff&quot; (which he *does* define); but it is also  missing some words and phrases I'd have fully expected to find here:  fortnight, counterpane, and &quot;Bob's your uncle&quot; on the British  side; cobbler and punt on the American side, just as examples.<br />There are  also some entries which, though sometimes entertaining, are not well  attributed or are out of date.  The use of &quot;scrump&quot; for pilfering  fruit from fruit trees is one I never heard in the UK; it is almost  certainly local to the West Country, where scrumpy (apple cider) is the  local moonshine; similarly, &quot;taproom&quot; is a word I knew from  literature but never ran into in real life.  On the American side, there  are occasional oddities that are perhaps regional: &quot;locate&quot;  meaning to find a job doesn't square with what I've heard here in Texas,  nor does &quot;frog&quot;, for the crossing plate on a railway, seem like  an entry that deserved its place.<br />Still, with these flaws, it's a fun  reference book to have. Perhaps (and it's not really a criticism) it's  really more entertaining than it is useful.	2000-08-15

In &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; Gould does a  masterful job of surveying both, and of showing how much damage IQ testing  and the ideas behind it can, and have, done.<br />The most interesting part of  the book is the historical detail Gould provides about each of the  scientists he discusses.  Take Cesare Lombroso, the founder of criminal  anthropology, which is the idea that criminals have distinctive and  identifiable body and facial characteristics.  This idea seems silly to  most of us now, but Gould drives the point home by citing some of  Lombroso's daftest ideas--for example, that prostitutes have prehensile big  toes (there's even a picture to show this!) or his claim that animals have  criminal types too, citing an ant &quot;driven by rage to kill and  dismember an aphid&quot;.  And although Lombroso was criticized at the  time, he was enormously influential.<br />The twentieth century figures in  this story typically made more complex mistakes in science, but Gould,  merely by repeating their own work, demolishes their credibility.  H.H.Goddard, who tested early American immigrants, found 87% of Russian  immigrants (and similar numbers from other nations) to be feeble-minded, a  result so ludicrous even Goddard couldn't believe it.  He fiddled with the  data and got the number down below 50%, ultimately explaining this number  by saying that only the poorest of each nation were emigrating to  America.<br />Gould takes the time with each failure of science to show just  where the foolishness lies.  After Lombroso and Goddard he reviews the work  of Terman, Yerkes, Burt, Spearman and Thurstone; the question of  &quot;g&quot;, general intelligence, is raised and dismissed, and many more  ridiculous stories appear.  Towards the end he goes into some detail on the  question of factor analysis; the flaw here is not trivial to explain, and  this is technically the hardest part of the book to follow.  However, by  this time the pattern of self-delusion is so clear that the reader takes  little persuading.<br />It's been said for years that what IQ tests measure is  how good you are at IQ tests.  Gould makes the case for this utterly  convincing.  This is a profound book, written by someone who understands  how science should work, and also how it really does work, all too often,  in the real world.dest part of the book to follow.

Cherry-Garrard starts his story in June, 1910,  as the _Terra Nova_ is leaving Cardiff, and ends it in early 1913, with  Robert Scott and four of his men dead on the ice.<br />The book has two  separate climaxes.  The first is the &quot;Winter Journey&quot;, which  Cherry-Garrard took with Birdie Bowers and Bill Wilson, to recover Emperor  penguin eggs, which were then (erroneously) thought to be scientifically  important.  Cherry-Garrard's prose is archetypically English, restrained  and transparent; but his language almost fails him here.  Only his  understated style tells you how bad it must be for him to say of an  Antarctic hurricane that hit them: &quot;The earth was torn in pieces: the  indescribably fury and roar of it all cannot be imagined.&quot;  Later he  makes it clear that for him there are no words that can convey it.  This  journey is, despite what comes later in the book, in some ways the most  memorable chapter.  It took five weeks, in Antarctic winter darkness.  A  temperature of -40 when they camped was a warm night for them.  They lost  their tent--certain death--blown away in a three-day hurricane, and  miraculously found it again.  It's no use; I can't give you an idea of it  in this review; all I can do is tell you to read this chapter, if you won't  read the whole book--you will never forget it.<br />The second climax is of  course the story of Scott's expedition.  Five men died; Edgar Evans of  scurvy; Titus Oates, who not long before the end, with horribly gangrenous  feet, walked into the blizzard to die in the hope that the party would be  less burdened without him, and Scott, Wilson and Bowers, found dead in  their tent by Cherry-Garrard and the others of the search party eight  months later, only eleven miles from a depot that might have saved them.  Cherry-Garrard went with them as far as the top of the Beardmore Glacier,  and tells the story from that point on using various diaries and journals  of the rest of the party.  Some of the secondary stories are in themselves  amazing feats of heroism and endurance, such as Crean, who walked thirty  five miles non-stop alone in the terrible cold to bring medical help for  Lieutenant Evans, dying of scurvy.<br />The one flaw is the maps; I wished for  more of them, and more detail, though the two main journeys are covered  well enough.  I don't agree with those reviewers who found the book  ponderous, though; it's detailed, but well-written. I found little I wanted  to skip except the occasional list of stores.<br />If you want the most recent  historiography, analyzing why Scott's expedition failed while Amundsen's  succeeded with so little trouble, you may want to go elsewhere.  Here  you'll find the record of a contemporary, a polar expert, passionate and  sincere.  An unforgettable book.the story from that point on using various diaries and journals  of the rest of the party.

The chapters are a lively mixture of  anecdote and analysis, and should entertain anyone with any level of  interest in chess.<br />Soltis knows his chess history, and tells some neat  stories, such as the history of Capablanca's Composition.  This is a  problem composed by Capablanca in 1908, in which flaws were found after his  death.  The problem itself is fascinating, but Soltis makes a good story of  the ups and downs of the subsequent analysis, and points out that chess  fame still awaits anyone who can save the composition.<br />Soltis is also  good with anecdote and wit; my favourite section perhaps being the very  tongue-in-cheek instructions on how to annotate a master game, e.g.  suggesting safe adjectives: &quot;positions are 'difficult,' 'winning,'  'critical,' 'hopeless,' or--the safest dodge of all--'shown in the  diagram.'&quot;<br />Very entertaining; recommended.	2000-08-14

The hundred short essays here are a hard-to-describe cross between humour and  serious scientific speculation.  The humour is actually in the science  itself, which sounds hard to believe until you read it.<br />For example,  Daedalus comes up with a scheme to generate electricity from the Rockies,  not by hydro-electricity, which lets the descent of water generate power,  but by the descent of the mountains themselves.  After all, he points out,  there is an enormous amount of energy locked up in all that high-altitude  rock.  His scheme for &quot;geo-electric power&quot; solves far more of the  difficulties in this plan than you might think, though (in this case) not  all of them.  The plausibility is itself the joke--it's not so much that  the scientific reader likes trying to spot the error, though that *is* fun  to try to do; Daedalus just presents these outrageous ideas completely  deadpan, and with a great deal of supporting evidence.<br />In fact, there is  no flaw at all in many of his schemes.  A column of his, collected in the  earlier &quot;Inventions of Daedalus&quot;, is actually cited by the  inventors of buckminsterfullerene as an early paper talking about the  possibilities for hollow carbon molecules, and several other articles have  been either prescient or have turned out to track current research.  But  the book is not just for scientists and engineers--anyone with a lay  interest in science will love it.<br />I recommend leaving it in the bathroom;  each essay is a couple of pages--just right.  It'll keep you entertained  for months.	2000-07-24

Then there's a chapter on general visitor information for the  region, and a section for foreign visitors.  The remaining chapters  are:<br />Getting to Know Santa Fe;  Where to Stay in Santa Fe;  Where to Dine  in Santa Fe;  What to See &amp; Do in Santa Fe;  Santa Fe Shopping;  Santa  Fe After Dark;  Excursions from Santa Fe;  Getting to Know Taos;  Where to  Stay in Taos;  Where to Dine in Taos;  What to See &amp; Do in Taos;   Albuquerque<br />The organization is good, with the hotels, for example,  clearly broken out by price range (&quot;Very Expensive&quot;,  &quot;Expensive&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot; and &quot;Inexpensive&quot;).   But the real value of the book is the author's candid evaluations.  We've  been burned in the past by guide books that gave every establishment a  glowing review, so it was pleasant to use this book to find lunch in Taos  one day last month.  Here's some of what we found:<br />Ogelvie's Bar and  Grill: &quot;The food here is not flavorful, and the atmosphere is  dated&quot;<br />Eske's Brew Pub: &quot;The crowd is local, a few people  sitting at the bar . . . .  At times it can be a rowdy place, but mostly  it's just fun, lots of ski patrollers and mountain guides . . .  .&quot;<br />Outback in Taos: &quot;My kayaking buddies always go here after a  day on the river.  That will give you an idea of the level of informality  (very), as well as the quality of the food and beer (great) and the size of  the portions (large).&quot;<br />It's clear that the author really loves the  area, and knows it inside out; we went to eight or ten places (hotels and  restaurants) that she recommends, and didn't regret a single one.	2000-07-18

The story he tells in &quot;Breaking the Maya Code&quot; involves his friends, his colleagues, and--in a couple of cases--his academic foes.  The story is a scientific one, but Coe provides a look at the human history too.<br />Mayan writing has only really started to give up its secrets in the last twenty five years.  Coe's primary thesis (for which he makes a convincing case) is that there are two reason it took so long: first, there was no large, widely available corpus of Mayan writing for epigraphers to work on; second, there was a widely held belief among Mayanists that the writing did not represent spoken language, but instead represented &quot;not Maya words or construction, but universal ideas&quot;.<br />He spends some time on the story of Champollion's decipherment of Egyptian writing in the early nineteenth century, in order to be able to draw parallels with the state of play in Mayanist studies.  Then he moves on through the history of the subject, with short biographies of many of the key academic figures, bringing the story up to 1992.  There's a short postscript for the 1999 edition.<br />Coe makes no bones about the academic in-fighting.  A couple of the reviews below object to his tone: he is very clear about who he thinks obstructed the field (Eric Thompson, for example), and who he thinks was critical to the successess (Yuri Knorosov).  His comments about Thompson, while sometimes affectionate, attribute much of the delay in understanding Mayan writing to the deadening effect of Thompson's influence. Thompson, a well-respected and very influential Mayanist, believed that the glyphs had no relationship to any spoken Mayan language, and poured scorn (Coe quotes some reviews) on those who disagreed.<br />In the end, I think Coe gets the balance about right.  There really is in-fighting in academe, and what he shows of it doesn't obscure the excitement of the decipherment.  Coe tellsa whole story: it's his personal view, but it's a view from the inside.  He's enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and he writes well.  Recommended.	2000-07-15

Jardine has pulled off quite a feat here: she weaves  together the interconnected stories of medicine, physics, astronomy,  cartography, anatomy, chemistry, biology and botany, along with a clear  look at the society in which the key figures moved.<br />Most histories of  this period that deal with science at all fall into a couple of easily  defined categories.  They may take a single thread and follow it: there are  many accounts of the discovery of calculus, for example, that discuss  Fermat, Descartes, Leibniz and Newton.  These books shed only a tangential  light on the social background and say little or nothing about the state of  the rest of science.  Other books may neglect the details of the science in  order to convey the society; or may provide biographies of individual  figures.  Jardine points out one of the dangers in this last approach:  Robert Boyle's first biographer decided to focus primarily on his  contributions to chemistry, and actually destroyed much source material  related to other interests of his.<br />Jardine's approach here is to give a  chapter to each of several fields, and trace the history of the field over  fifty or sixty years.  The first chapter, for example, covers astronomy,  including the identification of Halley's comet and the founding of the  Greenwich Observatory.  Once the players are introduced, the reader finds  them recurring over and over again in subsequent chapters; this is what  unifies the book.  By the end of the book the effect is that Hooke, Boyle,  Newton, Halley, Flamsteed, Oldenburg and the rest are so familiar that the  stories are strongly coloured by the personalities and politics involved,  adding another interesting layer to an already fascinating history.<br />The  Royal Society, which was founded in 1660, was of course a key player in allof this, and Jardine gives a good sense of both the gentlemanly biasses of  the group (and the times) and the political complications of its work.  For  example, Margaret Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle, despite having an  able mind and a great interest in science, was restricted by her gender  from scientific life outside her salon; and it was also clear that only  &quot;gentlemen&quot; could really participate.  On the political side,  Oldenburg, the first secretary of the R.S., got in trouble because of his  voluminous correspondence with scientists on the continent in countries  with which England was periodically at war.<br />Jardine includes a very  useful short chapter of capsule biographies of key figures at the end of  the book.  One thing she does not include that would have been useful is a  chronology, either in timeline form or just as a list.  This would be handy  as a skeleton for the information in the book.  The only other omission I  regret is that, as another reviewer here has noted, there is not always a  great deal of detail about the science itself.  This is a result of  Jardine's focus: she talks about the airpump experiments, for example,  rather than how the airpump itself worked.  These are minor shortcomings,  however, and I strongly recommend the book.	2000-07-10
US	52748657	R2Z3QHVE97351Y	0375406247	760899506	Lives of the Poets	Books	3	35	39	N	N	Fascinating but a little long	&quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; covers seven hundred years of English  language poets and poetry in a little under a thousand pages.  Schmidt  starts in the early fourteenth century--early enough that he takes several  chapters to get to Chaucer--and continues right up to the present day,  ending with Seamus Heaney and his contemporaries.<br />Schmidt's style is to  take several contemporary names and treat them together in a single  chapter.  Sometimes he gives a poet a chapter to himself (Edmund Spenser,  William Blake); sometimes he deals with half a dozen at a time.  The  chronological approach (which he acknowledges is disdained by some in  academe) works very well in providing a narrative, a sense of unfolding of  poetic skill and poetic tradition.<br />The period up to about 1900 is  beautifully done.  Most of the poets whose lives and work Schmidt describes  are well-known, either for their poetry, or at least as names.  He includes  quite a few, however, who will be familiar only to academics or real poetry  buffs--Juliana Berners, Robert Manning, Mary Wroth, William Cullen Bryant.   Schmidt's prose is lively and engaging, and his love for his subjects and  their poetry shines through.  I found myself inspired to read the poets I  didn't know.  I also found his discussion of the poets I did know  useful--he gives a lot of biographical detail, and makes thoughtful (and  sometimes acid) comments on the poetry itself.  For example, he's not a big  fan of Swinburne, and while he acknowledges his popularity and influence  has sharp things to say about his work.<br />However, Schmidt's coverage of  the twentieth century is less satisfying.  He covers more poets (about 130)  of the twentieth century than of the previous six hundred years (about  115).  He's aware this is a problem, and makes excuses for it at one point,  but it causes some difficulties for the reader.  When you read about  Richard Rolle or William Langland, even if you don't know their work,  Schmidt's placing of them in their historical context around Chaucer's time  allows you to fit them into the poetic scheme of things.  But when he  covers very recent poets, such as Edward Kamau Braithwaite, the historical  positioning Schmidt does is less convincing, and without even a quoted line  or two to judge him by the reader is unlikely to remember much about  Braithwaite at all.<br />The net effect is of a set of newspaper profiles of  modern poets.  This effect gets gradually worse towards the end of the  twentieth century poets, though many twentieth century poets are well-known  enough that the reader can supply some of the context for themselves (and  probably is familiar with the poetry).  Auden, Eliot, Yeats, and Kipling,  and even Larkin, Plath, Hughes and Heaney, need very little introduction to  those who've read even a little recent poetry.  The book would be better  for some culling of those poets whose work is not yet in this  class.<br />Overall, a fascinating read.  But if you're not the sort of person  reading modern poetry fairly regularly, the last three or four hundred  pages will probably be largely skimmed.	2000-07-09
US	52748657	R3691YMOKD4DJ4	0201657880	526837068	Programming Pearls (2nd Edition)	Books	5	111	115	N	N	A course in how to think like an experienced programmer	The thirteen columns in this book appeared in the Communications of the ACM between 1983 and 1985.  There can't be more than a couple of technical books on computing from that era that are still worth reading.  Kernighan  &amp; Ritchie's book, &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;, is one that  springs to mind; this book is definitely another, and will probably outlast  K&amp;R as it has almost no ties to existing or past hardware or  languages.<br />What Bentley does in each of these columns is take some part  of the field of programming--something that every one of us will have run  into at some point in our work--and dig underneath it to reveal the part of  the problem that is permanent; that doesn't change from language to  language.  The first two parts cover problem definition, algorithms, data  structures, program verification, and efficiency (performance, code tuning,  space tuning); the third part applies the lessons to example pseudocode,  looking at sorting, searching, heaps, and an example  spellchecker.<br />Bentley writes clearly and enthusiastically, and the  columns are a pleasure to read.  But the reason so many people love this  book is not for the style, it's for the substance--you can't read this book  and not come away a better programmer.  Inefficiency, clumsiness,  inelegance and obscurity will offend you just a little more after you've  read it.<br />It's hard to pick a favourite piece, but here's one nice example  from the algorithm design column that shows how little the speed of your  Pentium matters if you don't know what you're doing.  Bentley presents a  particular problem (the details don't matter) and multiple different ways  to solve it, calculating the relationship between problem size and run time  for each algorithm.  He gives, among others, a cubic algorithm (run time  equal to a constant, C, times the cube of the problem size, N--i.e. t ~  CN^3), and a linear algorithm with constant K (t ~ KN).  He then  implemented them both:the former in fine-tuned FORTRAN on a Cray-1  supercomputer; the latter in BASIC on a Radio Shack TRS-80.  The constant  factors were as different as they could be, but with increasing problem  size the TRS-80 eventually has to catch up--and it does.  He gives a table  showing the results: for a problem size of 1000, the Cray takes three  seconds to the TRS-80's 20 seconds; but for a problem size of 1,000,000,  the TRS-80 takes five and a half hours, whereas the Cray would take 95  years.<br />The book is informative, entertaining, and will painlessly make  you a better programmer.  What more can you ask?	2000-06-17

Antonia Barber has produced a superb story, based on the legend of the Cornish village of Mousehole.  Tom is an old fisherman who lives with Mowzer, his cat, who is also aging gracefully.   Their lives--organized around fish, firesides, milk, and scratching of  ears--fill the first few pages, and then the Great Storm-Cat arrives,  howling around the harbor and bottling up the fishing fleet.  Food in the  village starts to run low.  Finally, the day before Christmas, Tom and  Mowzer go out to fish together in the teeth of the storm, so that the  children of the village should not be hungry on Christmas Day.<br />The text  is powerful--remarkably so for a children's book.  But Nicola Bayley's  paintings are, if possible, even more astonishing.  There is a gorgeous  picture of the Great Storm-Cat and Mowzer at sea; fine, characterful  pictures of Tom, Mowzer and the village of Mousehole; and among other  treasures, one picture that always moves me to tears.  Another reviewer  said the book made them weep: I know the page they were talking about.   It's where Tom and Mowzer sail back to the village, to discover that the  villagers have realized they are gone, and are waiting for them.<br />Enough.   It's a beautiful picture.  Buy the book, even if you don't have kids,  though you'll get far more pleasure from reading this to a child.  The  language is a little complex for a child under five, but you can simplify  as you read.  And you'll read it again and again.	2000-06-02

I should have been tipped off by the fact that every single review in the book is glowingly positive; a dead giveaway that the book is  not independent.  It seems very likely to me that this is one of those  guides where the inns and hotels pay to be included, and may even write  their own reviews.<br />The book is divided up by types of place, so there's a  &quot;Country B&amp;B&quot; section, a &quot;Romantic Getaway&quot;  section, a &quot;Lakeside&quot; section, and so on. We booked one of the  &quot;Gourmet Getaways&quot; and one of the &quot;Farms&quot;; the former  was a disaster, but the latter was OK.  The gourmet place, a fancy inn in  Ludlow, was described as providing &quot;sumptuous feasts&quot; for  breakfast, with &quot;excellently trained and most personable&quot; staff,  and the option of picking up a &quot;sophisticated picnic lunch&quot;.   It's hard to imagine the editors actually ate at this place: the staff  clearly hated the management and were close-mouthed and unfriendly (and we  overheard the owner loudly berating one of the waitresses); the cooking was  very good, but not extraordinary, and the picnic was ridiculous--for $25 a  head we each got a nice little ash bucket with a quarter bottle of very  cheap champagne, a chunk of cheese, and a hunk of bread.<br />The farm was  described a little more accurately--the views were truly incredible, and  the cooking was home-cooking, wisely not praised in the guide book.<br />At  the gourmet place, in Ludlow, we met up with a couple of friends from  Britain.  They'd booked on our recommendations, but had bought a guide book  anyway, and we were alarmed to discover a much harsher evaluation of where  we were about to stay. In the end, we enjoyed ourselves enough--good  company and Vermont scenery can overcome most ills.  When we shop for a  vacation now, though, we always look for a guide book that seems willingto  criticize.	2000-05-27

This book documents a trip by car around America, starting and ending in Des Moines, after many years in the UK.  The ostensible theme of the book is a search for the perfect small town; a  sort of Ray Bradbury idealization of fifties America.  There's no such  town, of course, but Bryson just uses the theme as a springboard for some  of the funniest descriptions, stories, and digressions I have ever  read.<br />When I started reading this book, I laughed so much my wife  wouldn't let me read it in bed.  Then she picked it up and discovered how  funny it was, and wanted to read it before me.  Eventually we compromised,  and kept it in the car; the rule was that whoever was driving had to read  it to the driver.  Several times, however, the reader was laughing so hard  that they couldn't get comprehensible words out, and the driver had to pull  over to the hard shoulder and grab the book for themselves.<br />Yes, he's a  curmudgeon, as other reviewers here have noticed.  That's just his style.  He's not deep, either; his occasional ruminations aren't negligible, but  he's no Mark Twain.  But he has an acidly sharp eye for inanity and  stupidity, and his anecdotal technique is flawless.<br />His other travel  books are along much the same lines, but to me this is the funniest, though  &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; does show he is capable of good  introspective writing.  &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is sharp, satirical,  acute, and unkind--wickedly funny in every sense of the word.	2000-05-26

This book makes it easier to  understand the woman behind the two very different kinds of work she  produced.  Oppenheimer has gathered enough detail to paint a picture of a  talented, not very pretty, but determined young woman.  There are plenty of  details about Jackson's work--including, for example, quite some detail  about the creation of &quot;The Lottery&quot;, which Jackson's husband, the  critic Stanley Hyman, apparently recognized at once for the masterpiece it  was.<br />However, the children are as interesting as the books.  If you have  read Jackson's collections of stories about her children, these portraits  will be among the most fascinating parts of the book.  Oppenheimer follows  up somewhat on the children's lives after Shirley's death, helping to fill  in the picture--the youngest, Barry, was only twelve when she  died.<br />Recommended.	2000-05-19

And if you're in college, hoping for a job in computing when you graduate, this book is for you too.  It's an anarchic compendium  of the anarchic vocabulary, habits, and style of the programming  profession.<br />The New Hacker's Dictionary is mostly arranged as a set of  alphabetical entries, but there are a couple of excellent appendices, on  hacker folklore and on the hacker lifestyle and habits.  (Hacker is used  here in its original sense of someone who enjoys and is good at  programming--Raymond has included both &quot;hacker&quot; and  &quot;cracker&quot; as entries, of course.)  The entry on folklore is  simply hilarious; I wish I could just include Guy Steele's &quot;more  magic&quot; story here, but I'll just have to tell you to buy the  book.<br />The entries are a real mixture.  Many, such as &quot;indent  style&quot;, go beyond just defining the term: this entry gives examples of  the four major C styles and mentions the holy wars (another entry . . .)  which have occurred over them.  Some are quite current: Easter egg, kluge,  Trojan horse; others are arcane or dated, but still interesting: NeWS,  CP/M, chiclet keyboard.  All the entries are interesting and  well-written.<br />Newcomers to the field may find a good deal of  enlightenment here, and old-timers will find a lot of memories.  My own  favourite entries relate to the old text-based game Adventure, which I  encountered on a CDC machine in 1981.  &quot;I see no &lt;X&gt; here.&quot;   &quot;Plugh!&quot;  &quot;Xyzzy!&quot;  *Sigh*  It almost makes me miss  those old teletypes.	2000-05-17

He introduces each interview (his subjects include Chomsky, Eysenck, Laing and  Skinner, and nine others) with a few pages giving a survey of the  interviewee, their history, their theories, and their place in the field.   There's also an introductory essay, and a final essay, entitled  &quot;Tentative Conclusions&quot;, that tries to draw some common threads  out of the disparate responses given by Cohen's subjects.<br />Cohen's  analysis is interesting and useful, but he is really just setting the  stage.  The interviews are illuminating and thought-provoking.  Most of  all, however, one gets a sense of a field in flux; a field where there are  few universally accepted truths.<br />The book is now a little dated: it was  written in 1977.  However, overall, it's clearly written and informative.   Recommended.	2000-05-16

Most readers will come to this book after having read one of his better known collections, such as &quot;The  Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;, though in fact I believe this  precedes all of them except &quot;Awakenings&quot;.  &quot;A Leg to Stand  On&quot; has much in common with those books, but it is much more personal,  and it tells a unified story.<br />The first chapter, &quot;The  Mountain&quot;, tells how Sacks suffered a terrible injury to his left leg  while hiking high above Hardanger Fjord in Norway.  He was alone, and  nobody knew where he was; he would certainly die of exposure if he didn't  reach help by nightfall.  The chapter is as gripping as anything in a  thriller, and much more believable.<br />The next chapter, however,  &quot;Becoming A Patient&quot;, is the one that will give readers of Sacks'  other work a frisson of recognition.  Many times Sacks has taken the reader  through the doctor-patient relationship from the doctor's side, but now he  must experience it from the patient's side, and it is a revealing chapter.   It ends with an extraordinary transition: Sacks has realized that he has a  neurological problem with his leg--he can't &quot;locate&quot; it; it feels  like it's made of wood--but the surgeon who operated on him refuses,  point-blank, to accept that there is a problem.<br />The remainder of the  book--about half--is devoted to the path to Sacks' ultimate recovery.   Sacks has deep powers of observation, and there are luminously informative  sequences here--my favourite is perhaps the exchange with the  physiotherapists, when they are trying to show him how to walk, but he has  forgotten how.  The book closes with a chapter of musings on the nature of  Sacks' experience and its relationship with his work.<br />This is a  thoughtful book, and a good introduction to Sacks' work, but I think  readers of Sacks' other books will like it the most.	2000-05-14

This is one of the  best popular science books around, and I don't even think Gregory intended  it to be a layman's book--it's just so well written and interesting that it  will delight lay readers as well as its intended student  audience.<br />Gregory starts with a short chapter intended to outline some of  the less-obvious issues in understanding how we see.  Here, as well as  throughout the book, he uses optical illusions to make points.  The next  chapters cover light itself, and the structure and function of the eye and  brain, including accounts of how the eye evolved.  The rest of the book  discusses brightness, colour, and questions such as &quot;How do we  visually determine size?&quot; and &quot;Can machines be taught to  see?&quot;<br />The book is full of accounts of intriguing experiments and  case-studies.  Two examples of many: Gregory and a colleague, Jean Wallace,  worked in 1961-1962 with a man of 52 whose sight was restored to him after  a life of blindness.  The account of his slow and incomplete adaptation to  the world of sight, and his ultimate slide into depression and death (he  had been active and capable as a blind person) is fascinating and moving.   Another example: Gregory discusses various researchers who spent some time  wearing vision apparatus that dramatically changed their perceptions, such  as Stratton, Ewert and the Paterson's.  In these cases--where for example  the wearer could see their own body suspended in front of them, or see  everything upside down--the details of the adaptations of perception are  thought-provoking and still not completely understood.<br />Strongly  recommended.	2000-05-13

Like other reviewers I approached this with a little trepidation, thinking that it would be a dry study of ancient history.  I  was surprised and delighted to find that Herodotus, at least in this  translation (by Aubrey de Selincourt), is lively, witty and frankly more  readable than many modern history writers.<br />There are copious footnotes,  provided by John Marincola, and I found them very valuable in providing  context.  For example, Herodotus gives, in book seven, an incredible  account of how Xerxes had a channel cut through the Athos peninsula a mile  and a half long and a hundred feet wide, just to pass through on his  invasion of Greece, and not for permanent use.  Marincola points out in the  footnotes that later writers of antiquity ridiculed this account, but that  in fact archaeological evidence has been found to support it.<br />Marincola  also provides a structural outline of the histories, several maps (which  are absolutely invaluable), and a chronology, plus lists of the most  important kingships.  The histories cover quite a bit of territory and  time, but the focus is on the war between Persia and Greece, waged first by  Darius and then by Xerxes.  The timeline, in modern terms, is about 560  B.C. to 480 B.C.; however, particularly when talking about Egypt, Herodotus  goes back much further.<br />Herodotus' general style, in fact, is to use the  political events of the history as springboards for relating the  information he has about the customs of the various Mediterranean  societies.  There are many digressions on the customs of the Babylonians,  the Thracians, the Libyans, the Indians, and so on; these are placed  whereever they seem most relevant in the story.  But the digressions do not  obscure the fact that Herodotus is simply a terrific story-teller.  He  relates little anecdotes about how so-and-so became king or incurred the  wrath of Xerxes or died in battle with tremendous gusto; he is opinionated,  coherent, and just plain fun to read.<br />More than just the pleasure of  reading well-written history, however, there is something else to be gained  from reading Herodotus.  The histories are now almost 2500 years old.  It  is impossible to read them without wishing to have met Herodotus; without  realizing that whatever we think about our technological progress, men of  wit, genius and breadth of learning have existed for millenia and are not  confined to the present day.  When you read the Histories, and perhaps  especially when you read the section on Egypt, which was, incredibly, as  old to Herodotus as Herodotus is to us, you start to feel the true depth of  human time in a way very hard to achieve.<br />A classic, in every sense of  the word.  You'll love it.died in battle with tremendous gusto; he is opinionated,  coherent, and just plain fun to read.<br />More than just the pleasure of  reading well-written history, however, there is something else to be gained  from reading Herodotus.

It's a Panther paperback, printed in 1964, bought by my parents, and found by my sister and myself on their shelves a few years later.  I can still  remember the shock when I read this, at the age of perhaps eleven, at  realizing just how inhuman people could be because of something as  seemingly trivial as skin colour.<br />Griffin spent a little over a  month--parts of November and December, 1959--with his skin artificially  darkened by medication.  In that time he traveled through Louisiana,  Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, finding out at first hand what it is like  to be treated as a second-class citizen--or, as he says, as a tenth-class  citizen.  Everyone now know the story of the big injustices, the lynchings,  the civil rights cases, and for most people those are now just another page  in the history text book.  Griffin's experiences take the daily evils of  racism and thrust them in your face, just as they were thrust in his--the  rudeness of the clerk when he tried to pay for a train ticket with a big  bill; the difficulty he had in finding someone who would cash a traveler's  check for a Negro; the bus-driver who wouldn't let any blacks off the bus  to use the restrooms; the white man who followed him at night and  threatened to mug him.<br />I've heard people worry that this is the white  experience of racism: that whites can read this book and feel good because  a white person felt the pain too.  I'm white, so I don't know that I can  judge that argument completely impartially, but I can tell you that this  book profoundly shaped my views on racism, and that any book that can do  what this book did for me is a book that is good to have around.<br />One more  thing.  I've said a lot about how powerful, and how influential the book  is.  I should add that it is also a gripping story.  Though Griffin only  spends a month with dark skin, by the time you finish the book it feels  like an eternity.<br />A wonderful read, and a truly amazing story.	2000-05-08

However, most  of the parents I know who have used this book have a much more basic  need--their child, who may be anywhere from three months old to five years  old, or even older--won't fall asleep by herself, and/or who wakes up in  the night and cries.  The book explains clearly why this happens so much,  and how to fix the problem.  This is all covered in the first two chapters  of the book, and if the problem described above is your problem then that's  all you'll need to read.<br />The first chapter briefly describes the problem,  and talks about identifying other problems, and about normal sleep  patterns.  The second chapter starts with a section called &quot;What Your  Child Associates with Falling Asleep--the Key Problem&quot;.  When I read  this, I knew that what he was describing was exactly the problem my  daughter Jesse (then five months old) was suffering from; by the end of the  chapter I knew how to solve it.<br />What I had feared was that I would be  told to let her cry herself to sleep.  However, Ferber thinks that this is  a cruel and not very effective approach.  Instead, he outlines a method  based on two things: reassuring your child, and making sure they are alone  when they do finally fall asleep.  The truly astonishing thing about this  method is how quickly it works.  It took just three days for Jesse to go  from waking up three times a night and fussing for an hour before falling  asleep to sleeping for at least six or seven hours straight and falling  asleep within ten minutes of going down.<br />You sometimes hear people  talking about how a book &quot;changed their life&quot;.  Well, if your  child isn't sleeping well, this book could change yours.	2000-05-07

The first half, &quot;Doorways to the Future&quot;, is an eighty-odd page history of science fiction art.  Di Fate goes back to Bosch and da Vinci, and then  gives several pages to the late nineteenth century illustrators such as  Robida and the early pulp artists before moving on to the genre work that  fills most of the pages.<br />Di Fate's history is sound, and the stories are  interesting, but he accompanies them with pictures that are distractingly  gorgeous to look at and which make it hard to concentrate on the tale he  tells.  Page 34, for example, has a full page reproduction of the Startling  Stories cover for van Vogt's &quot;The Shadow Men&quot; that shows a black  robot firing a ray gun, with green rays shooting from its eyes, and a  beautiful scantily clad woman struggling in its arms.  How can you  concentrate on the text with that sort of thing going on?<br />The second half  (actually two-thirds by page count) of the book is called &quot;Masters of  the Infinite&quot; and consists of (mostly) two page spreads of each of  about a hundred artists.  There's a little text too, maybe two or three  paragraphs, to give you some context for the artist.  Only the most  influential get more than two pages--Freas of course, Frazetta, Whelan,  Paul.  Richard Powers gets four pages, which is good to see--he's not as  well known now as he should be, perhaps because he did so much work for  book covers rather than magazines; but he is a major figure.<br />There are a  couple of odd omissions, which other reviewers have noted below.  I'll just  mention one: Chris Foss, who was perhaps the single most influential  British sf artist ever.  What makes the omission even more extraordinary is  that di Fate acknowledges Foss' tremendous influence twice, on pages 82 and  84.  Perhaps there were copyright problems, and Foss' work wasn't  available; whatever the reason, it's a pity.<br />The only other negative  comment I have is that the book is no more than a survey.  Lovers of the  work of any of these artists will have to go elsewhere for their fix of  Bonestell or Finlay or Barlowe--no one artist has more than half a dozen  works here.  But that's what the book is designed to be, and *as* a survey  it works wonderfully well.e  comment I have is that the book is no more than a survey.

This book collects 38 pieces he wrote over thirty years, half book reviews and half articles.  All of them attack, and in most cases dismember, pseudoscience and its  claims.<br />The book reviews are acid and make interesting reading, but the  articles are the meat of the book, because here is where Gardner assembles  fully coherent arguments not just to demolish a foolish book, but to show  in detail how someone like Uri Geller fools people.  It becomes abundantly  clear as you read this book that any competent magician (Gardner is one)  can duplicate any of the feats of ESP or spoon-bending cited.  It's sad,  but not surprising, that this never makes the headlines the way Geller's  original claims did back in the seventies.<br />In addition to pieces on  modern figures, some less well-known than Geller, Gardner also writes about  figures such as Conan Doyle, who was a passionate believer in spiritualism;  and Freud, who had a long and very close friendship with a numerologist.  There is a short piece on Einstein, who is often cited by parapsychologists  as an establishment figure who nevertheless believed in ESP.  Gardner  comprehensively demolishes the basis for this citation, quoting letters  from Einstein showing that he had no such belief, and was in fact very  sceptical.<br />The only reason I haven't given the book five stars is that  its very nature as an anthology prevents it from really achieving  coherence.  It's an excellent addition to the sceptic's armoury, though,  and I strongly recommend it, along with another of Gardner's along similar  lines: &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;.	2000-05-06

His &quot;Lost Continent&quot; is one of the funniest books I've ever read, and I've liked everything he's written.  &quot;The Mother Tongue&quot; is less  sidesplitting than much of his work, but it makes up for that by the  endless anecdotes about English.<br />Not all his facts are straight, though;  see other reviews here for a list of some errors.  One among many: he  repeats the old and thoroughly discredited claim that the Eskimo language  has more words for snow than English does; fifty words.  In fact English  has many more words than Eskimo (Inuit), though the agglutinative nature of  the language means that it is hard to limit the word count in Eskimo.  The  claim is covered in detail in Geoffrey Pullum's &quot;The Great Eskimo  Vocabulary Hoax&quot;.<br />&quot;The Mother Tongue&quot; is structured as a  history of English.  However, reading it, what one remembers are the little  details.  When he talks about the rising call for spelling reform at the  end of the eighteenth century, he cites Noah Webster, lobbying Congress to  make bad spelling a punishable offense.  In the dicussion of Americanisms,  to  illustrate the inexplicable British hostility to American English, he  quotes the stylebook of the Times of London: &quot;'normalcy' should be  left to the Americans who coined it&quot;; in fact, 'normalcy' is a British  coinage.  These touches are what makes this book so good.  They add a  personal and amusing feel to material that is already fascinating.<br />Bryson  covers quite a few topics.  In addition to the chapters on spelling and  Americanisms, and several devoted primarily to history, there are chapters  on swearing, wordplay, pronunciation, word origins, names, usage and  dialects.  Each is full of colourful stories and is a pleasure to  read.<br />Highly recommended.  Just don't believe every single story.	2000-05-06
US	52748657	R2NF382PVENND0	0671628186	651935791	Men of Mathematics (Touchstone Book)	Books	5	82	85	N	N	Opinionated, entertaining, informative and riveting	This book has entertained, educated and intrigued two generations of young aspiring mathematicians, as well as people who would never grow up to do research mathematics, but who could see the beauty of number.  Bell's style  is addictive; he makes every personality come to life--from Galois,  brilliant, unlucky and doomed, to Gauss, the &quot;Prince of  Mathematicians&quot;, to Pascal, mystical and tormented.  No one who reads  this book can forget, for example, the section entitled &quot;Galois' last  night&quot;, where, the night before Galois knows he will die, he spends  &quot;the fleeting hours feverishly dashing off his last will and  testament, writing against time to glean a few of the great things in his  teeming mind before the death which he foresaw could overtake him.  Time  after time he broke off to scribble in the margin 'I have not time; I have  not time,' and passed on to the next frantically scrawled  outline.&quot;<br />Which is sad, in a way, because it is, according to modern  accounts of Galois' life, not accurate. The work Bell is describing was  written before his last night, in no such hurry.  This has been known for  some time, and yet few who know, and who perhaps should know better, will  relinquish their affection for this marvellous book.  It so captures the  enthusiasm one can feel for the beauty and poetry that mathematics brings  to the mind that errors of fact are minor flaws.<br />And the errors are few  enough that they really don't matter.  In Galois' case, for example, one  takes away a deeply etched portrait of an astonishing mind that descended  on revolutionary France like a meteorite, and which had about as much  chance of being understood.  This is accurate, and Bell tells his stories  so powerfully that they stay in the mind--for decades, in my case and that  of others I know who have read him.<br />Bell includes many wonderful quotes  and stories.  The whole first section of the book is just a series of  quotes--my favourite is perhaps Weierstrass, &quot;A mathematician who is  not also something of a poet will never be a complete mathematician.&quot;     But he lards the book with quotes, and since this book can profitably be  read by an enthusiastic 12-year-old, and often has been, for many people  this book is the first time they will meet with such famous quotes as  Newton's line about being merely a child, playing with pretty pebbles on  the seashore.<br />Bell claims that the book is not a history of mathematics,  and he's right.  It's a series of chapters that provide biographical--and  mathematical--sketches of thirty-odd great mathematicians, from Archimedes  to Cantor.  You'll learn a lot about the history of mathematics from this  book, but mostly you'll be infected by the passionate enthusiasm of someone  who knows and loves his subject.  Buy it; read it; if you love mathematics  you won't regret it.	2000-05-06

The stories are not &quot;original&quot;: there's no such thing when they were  almost without exception passed down orally; but they are in old, not very  modernized tellings.<br />Many readers who have only seen or read modern,  Disney-fied versions of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty or Snow-White will not  recognize some of the darker twists in these tales.  For example, in  Sleeping Beauty, when the Prince wakes the Princess and marries her, the  story is by no means over.  The Prince's mother is an Ogress, whom his  father married for her wealth, and it's suspected that she likes to eat  little children; that &quot;whenever she saw little children passing by,  she had all the difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them&quot;.   The happy couple have two children, named Day and Morning, and the Ogress  decides to dine on them one day when the Prince is away.  Yes, it still has  a happy ending, but Disney it isn't.<br />The illustrations--8 full page, plus  130 smaller ones--are all from the original 1891 edition.  They're black  and white woodcuts; very atmospheric, and I think most children will like  them.<br />The only thing that might have to be explained to a child is the  occasional use of vocabulary that is no longer current.  Most often this is  the use of &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot;; but a few other words  will crop up.  However, they're usually inferable from context, and the  stories are marvellous entertainment regardless.	2000-05-06

Some are eyewitness accounts of important historical events, but more often they are pieces that give you the flavour of a time and place in a way no history text can possibly manage.  These stories stay in the mind long  after a dry textbook narrative would have faded away.<br />Some examples:  there is a first-hand account of a survivor of the Black Hole of Calcutta  in 1756, a story I had read about as a schoolboy but which finally came  alive for me when I read this piece. There is a piece by Fanny Burney  relating her mastectomy in 1811, performed without anaesthesia of any kind.   There's an excerpt of an interview by a British Parliamentary Commission  in 1815 with a twenty-three year old woman severely deformed as a result of  the terrible conditions in the Leeds factories; this one had me practically  in tears.  There's an account from someone who had dinner with Attila the  Hun; an account of a pipefitter who was at Pearl Harbour; Charlotte  Bronte's account of the Crystal Palace--the list is seemingly endless, and  endlessly fascinating.<br />The book rewards skimming, and is hard to put  down--just one more story about Trafalgar, or the Civil War, or Caesar . .  . .<br />The only thing I'd like to change about the book is that most of the  accounts are from the last 150 years; I'd have enjoyed reading more older  pieces.  However, it's not John Carey's fault that it is far easier to find  recent accounts than old ones, and the many twentieth century tales are  just as much fun to read as the older ones.<br />A terrific book.	2000-04-30

Each is different; most are fairly successful, but all are illuminating.  The book is written well enough that it is a much more engaging read than most business books.<br />I was particularly  interested by their study of W.L.Gore, which has perhaps the most  remarkable structure (or lack of it) of any company in America.  They  provide enough detail to get a sense of a really remarkable company; most  of the other case studies, which involve providing autonomy to small groups  rather than completely demolishing the traditional company hierarchy, are  both less impressive in their achievements and easier to implement.<br />The  book does a good job of making the case for autonomy, and the authors  include the necessary caveat that you can only build a crack team out of  good quality employees.  The fundamental argument is that people work  better and harder when they're given autonomy, and that companies can  therefore reap big rewards from doing so.<br />Readers interested in this area  might also like to look at Ackoff's &quot;The Democratic Corporation&quot;.   Both books, however, in reviewing how to improve a company's performance  by changing its internal structure, don't address the ownership issue at  all--i.e. whether employee ownership is a necessary or at least valuable  part of the mix in creating the right incentives for employees to  &quot;behave like owners&quot;.  That aside, however, I can strongly  recommend this book: it's a fascinating survey of some unusual but very  powerful management strategies.	2000-04-29

The target age (I'm guessing, since the book doesn't say) is about 9-12.  The book takes the beginner all the way from introducing the pieces and how they move to some example games, including the beautiful Morphy/Duke of Brunswick game.  The very last  chapter provides information on how to locate a chess club, and  encouragement to join.<br />Snyder uses algebraic notation throughout, which  is an important point to check.  He does explain descriptive notation at  the end, for readers who look through older books.<br />The book is well  structured, with general guidelines for the opening preceding an  introduction to the Ruy Lopez.  He also briefly covers the Giuoco Piano,  and there are sections on the Sicilian and the Queen's Indian and  Nimzo-Indian defenses.  The information is at just the right level for a  beginner; taking just one or two lines, with few digressions, but  explaining the reasoning behind the moves.  There are excellent sections on  basics such as the use of rooks, king and pawn endgames and the use of  opposition, and basic checkmating positions such as back-rank mate.<br />The  only caution I'd add is not to buy this book for a child younger than eight  or nine.  It's for someone who is mature enough to stick through the first  couple of chapters, up to where it gets fun. My daughter, who is about to  turn five, has been pestering me to teach her chess, since she sees me  enjoying it.  Since she's not old enough yet to understand strategy or  really tactics either I have had to invent little games involving just a  couple of pieces to get her familiar with the moves--e.g. spending several  lessons showing her how to checkmate me with two rooks.  What I need is  help with inventing fun ways to learn these things.  This book doesn't  provide that--it's a little dry till you actually get to the chessboard ,  which doesn't happen for fifty pages.<br />However, I don't know of a better  book for kids to learn from.  With an enthusiastic adult to help, I think  this book can really deliver the goods.	2000-04-29

The first covers &quot;Core Javascript&quot;, defining the language itself with only occasional references to how you  might use it in a browser.  This initially seemed to me to be a roundabout  way to approach the language--why wouldn't you want to explain it by  examples in a web page?  However, after becoming more familiar with the  language I think it was absolutely the right decision, since it avoids  confusing the document object model (see below for more about that) with  the language itself, a confusion common among beginners.<br />At the end of  the first section (which developers experienced in other languages can  skim, but shouldn't skip) you know what Javascript code looks like and how  to do assignments, define functions, and so on.  The second section,  &quot;Client-side Javascript&quot;, is where examples start to show up that  you can really run in a test page of your own.  The examples are good and  there are plenty of them.<br />The heart of the second section is the  discussion of the document object model.  After some introductory  discussion, covering windows and frames and some of the more common  Javascript tasks, there's an overview of the DOM.  Subsequent chapters  cover it in more detail.  This organization makes it pretty easy to find  what you need without even resorting to the index.  For example, I find the  forms chapter, and the chapter on how to use cookies to save state, to be  very useful, and easy to find information in.<br />Finally, there's a  reference section at the back.  This is the most valuable section once  you're well on your way with the language, and is what I now use most of  all.  It's comprehensive and clearly written.<br />The book does have one  weakness, which has been noted by other reviewers here: it doesn't have a  &quot;cookbook&quot; section, showing you how to do common tasks with  Javascript.  This is a seriousomission because of the nature of Javascript  usage.  Very often a webmaster for a small non-profit or a small business  will decide they want to do a rollover, or add an alert for form validation  failures, or something similar.  Users like this need something equivalent  to the &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;; a &quot;How to . . .&quot; section that  gives you an example close to what you need.<br />Despite this caveat,  however, this is still the best book around: an excellent reference, and a  great way to learn the language.	2000-04-27

The coverage is very complete; in fact the main problem with the book is that the authors go into so much detail that it can be a little frustrating  when you try to  use the book as a reference.<br />For learning, however, it is perfect.  I  worked through the book from the beginning, and found that it guided me  accurately and fairly quickly through setting up a 1200 man-hour 4 person  project.  What I particularly liked was that it covered some special  settings I happen to need in the course of covering the related topics,  rather than having a chapter for each pulldown menu.  For example, there  are many things you can do with the Task Information dialog, but the book  goes back to that screen at different points in order to explain different  details.  I needed to set my tasks as &quot;Fixed Work&quot;, rather than  &quot;Fixed Units&quot; or &quot;Fixed Duration&quot;; failing to make this  setting would have caused chaos for me, but chapter 10, &quot;Assigning  Resources and Costs to Tasks&quot;, made the right answer quite  clear.<br />The book covers every aspect of Project 98.  There are excellent  sections on reports, views, and formatting, and good tips on how to tailor  the input screens to your needs.  It also covers integrating multiple  projects and the use of macros and VB.  Perhaps even more usefully, it  reviews some basic project management guidelines as it goes through the  tasks involved in setting up and tracking a project, so that it is almost   possible to learn project management (or at least the planning and tracking  skills needed) from this book at the same time as learning the tool  itself.<br />The book is long--close to 1,000 pages of material--but project  management is a complicated subject and the book is not to blame for that.   However, the very thing that makes the book valuable for learning makes it  a poor reference.  For example, if you have a question about task data, a  look in the index reveals six columns starting with &quot;Task&quot;.  The  answer you want is no doubt there, but it may take some digging.  Another  example: there are four separate chapters, covering 130 pages, just on the  topics of allocating resources and costs.  This is a complex subject, but  it makes it hard to swiftly dive in and get an overview of the tool's  capabilities in the area.<br />Overall, I think this is a terrific book to get  for learning to use Project 98.  I'm still looking for the perfect quick  reference though.	2000-04-25

When I got this book in 1980, I had access to a Unix system and worked through much of the tutorial  material in it.  On the way I learnt a great deal, not just about C, but  about good programming style, code reuse, the value of clear comments--in  short, I was introduced to the skill set of an experienced computer  professional.<br />The book was a trendsetter in several ways.  For example,  the very first exercise given is to print &quot;hello, world&quot;; this is  now seen as the first exercise in innumerable other, more recent books,  many of which may not realize that they are borrowing from K&amp;R.  The  rest of chapter 1 (there's a chapter 0, an introduction; another geek-cool  change which has been widely copied) is a tutorial that takes you through  assignment statements, data types, if/else, for, while, printf, function  definitions, arrays, and variable scoping, in less than 30 pages.  If you  work your way through the embedded exercises you'll have written utilities  to strip tabs, reverse input by lines, strip trailing whitespace from  input, and several others.  This is much more challenging than most  tutorials, but the effect on the student is that you feel you are being  treated as an equal.  The book doesn't talk down to you; it gives you  accurate and concise answers.  It's written for programmers, in other  words.<br />The next few chapters go back over the elements of C in more  detail, and should also be treated as a tutorial.  Going through this  material religiously will be far more valuable than any college class could  possibly be.<br />There is a reference section at the back, which is good to  have.  But the real value of this book is in the tutorial approach: it is a  rare pleasure in the computing field to find a book that is simultaneously  clear, stimulating and informative.	2000-03-13

I am a member of a word puzzle organization (puzzlers.org) and this is our standard reference, along with the unabridged version, &quot;Webster's Third New International Dictionary&quot;.  Many very obscure words show up in puzzles, but it is relatively rare I find I have to go to the unabridged dictionary to look them up.<br />In addition to being thorough (with excellent sections on abbreviations, foreign words and phrases (such as &quot;en plein jour&quot; or &quot;inshallah&quot;) it includes compressed but informative etymological data.  For example, the entry on &quot;spacious&quot; has this - ME, fr. MF spacieux, fr. L spatiosus, space, room -- more at SPEED (14c)&quot;; in a little over a single line you get the lineage, with a reference to yet more information.  You may have to learn some of the abbreviations (Middle English, Middle French, 14th century) but I found them generally intuitive and didn't need to look them up much at all.<br />In addition, there are excellent usage paragraphs scattered throughout.  These are of two types.  One type compares the usage of different words with very similar meanings.  For example, the entry on &quot;satiate&quot; provides a usage paragraph that compares &quot;satiate&quot;, &quot;sate&quot;, &quot;surfeit&quot;, &quot;cloy&quot;, &quot;pall&quot;, &quot;glut&quot; and &quot;gorge&quot;, identifying the precise differences of usage between them.  The paragraph is cross-referenced at each of the other six words, so you don't have to just stumble across satiate to find it.<br />The other kind of usage paragraph discusses correctness.  A good example is &quot;hopefully&quot;, which in its sense &quot;I hope that&quot; is controversial.  The dictionary asserts the validity of this controversial use, which is sure to annoy some purists, but it does acknowledge the debate and cite grammatical arguments for its position.<br />The dictionary is available online, and I strongly recommend you take a look at it.  There is a CD-ROM for sale too, which is worth getting as it adds some fancy search features, though if you're like me you'll want the paper version to keep by the bed.	2000-02-27

The vocabulary is tight--71 words (I wrote them out separately to help Jesse!)--and presented  very well, with simple, exciting and fun illustrations.<br />All the activity  involves dogs--blue dogs on red trees, big and little dogs, dogs in cars,  in mazes, in boats and on rooftops.  The text of the first five pages is:  &quot;Dog./Big dog./Little dog./Big dogs and little dogs./Black and white  dogs.&quot;; this is perfect for a child learning to read, with the  repetition building confidence very quickly.<br />The artwork is good and  straightforwardly entertaining; perhaps not up to Dr. Seuss' standards, but  then very little is.

As a result the book pays little attention to the spiritual meaning of the bible, and I wouldn't advise buying this if  that is your main interest.<br />However, whether you are Christian or not,  Asimov does an excellent job of placing the events of the bible in a  historical context.  There are dozens of maps, which I found  invaluable--for example he provides a sequence of maps that cover from 1  Samuel through 2 Kings that show the changing boundaries of Israel and  Judah from the reign of Saul through David and Solomon and onwards.  He  also provides a chronology of important events in biblical times, covering  primarily biblical events but also other historical events.<br />Although  Asimov was not a Christian, there is little here that can be construed as a  direct attack on Christianity, unless you feel that a secular approach to  the bible is already an attack.  Occasionally his approach highlights  points which an atheist will be happy to see, such as the fact that the  later gospels ascribe more miracles to Christ than the earlier ones do, or  the fact that the gospel of John has many inconsistencies with the other  three.  For the most part, however, Asimov sidesteps the question of  Christian truth.<br />The book is now thirty years old, and as a result does  not contain the latest scholarship.  However, it is not intended as a  scholarly work: instead it's a very readable presentation of a great deal  of the fascinating background to the most influential book in Western  civilization.	2000-02-12
US	52748657	RTUFTE3ED6QEO	0028649257	129293349	Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing Piano (The Complete Idiot's Guide)	Books	2	83	84	N	N	Too much talk and not enough practice pieces	I bought three books on learning to play the piano, and this was easily the weakest of them.  The book is wittily written, but it is very short on actual pieces of music to play.  The first time you put your fingers to the  keyboard is in chapter 7, on p.48.  Then there's another very short  practice piece.  Then there's a whole chapter on sharps, flats and  fingering, with no practice at all.  The first six chapters, instead of  getting you started, cover things like the history of keyboard instruments  and how a piano works--fascinating, but not what you expect from a book  entitled &quot;Guide to Playing the Piano&quot;.<br />I think the intention is  to very simply explain what all the notation means, and in fact the text  does a reasonable job.  However, if you're interested in actually playing  the piano and having fun this is a very frustrating book.  Even the  practice pieces aren't songs; it's fun to play things you know, even if  it's only &quot;Row, Row Your Boat&quot; and &quot;Frere Jacques&quot;.   The first practice piece in this book that is clearly an arrangement of a  song is &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, on p.103.  This is almost halfway  through the book!<br />I should add that Hill has included some chapters that  are not in the other books I bought which are interesting.  These include  notes on buying a piano, maintaining it, and on things like what classical  music to try and how to stay motivated. There's also a section on MIDI and  home music studios.  However, if you're primarily interested in getting to  the point where you can have fun with songs you know, this is not the right  book for you.	2000-01-23
US	52748657	R16YQ00Z5DB30N	079350242X	117099981	Easy Adult Piano Beginner's Course	Books	5	403	405	N	N	Excellent for the complete beginner	I tried three beginner's adult piano books, and I found this by far the best.  The other two were The Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing the Piano, which had too much talk and not enough practice pieces, and You Can Play Piano, which was OK.<br />Another reviewer mentioned that the book uses an  unorthodox notation.  This is true; the musical notes have the letter  written on them, so that, for example, a middle C is not just a black spot,  but a black spot with a white C inside it.  This is certainly non-standard,  but I found it very handy--at the early stages of learning you're trying  very hard to coordinate your sight of the notes on the page with your  fingers and your understanding of which notes on the keyboard are which.   Every little helps, and this helped me a lot.  It doesn't hurt much,  because you do get familiar with the standard notation at the same time,  and it makes getting started much less painful.<br />The best thing about this  book, however, is that there are lots of songs you can play to practice.  Within a week I was playing (not perfectly, but recognizably) Cockles and  Mussels, When the Saints, Londonderry Air, Skater's Waltz, Home Sweet Home,  Row Row Your Boat, Now is the Hour, Marianne, Long Long Ago, Frere Jacques  and Greensleeves.  This is *lots* more fun than playing the same one or two  songs over and over again.  Plus these songs are all arranged for two  hands, with very simple left hand arrangements to start with.<br />At the back  of the book are twenty more songs arranged both for complete beginners and  for people who have completed the first half of the book.  Even at a very  early stage it is fun to poke around in this section and pick out at least  the melody line with the right hand.<br />Overall, very strongly recommended.   I've had a lot of fun with this book and I expect to have a lot more.	2000-01-22
US	52748657	R1UPOFV9DP1GFT	0201823764	46613578	UNIX for the Impatient (2nd Edition)	Books	4	23	24	N	N	Ideal quick reference for an experienced IT professional	If you just need to get something done--using Emacs to write some C++, or zipping up some files on a Unix box and ftp'ing them somewhere else--then this is the book you need.  The authors assume that you know what a file,  or a directory, or a compiler is.  The target audience is someone for whom  Unix is the third or fourth (or more) operating system they've had to work  with.<br />The book is indexed by function, not just by command.  For example,  suppose you want to compress a bunch of files.  Looking up compress takes  you to p.140; reading the possibilities you soon discover that gzip and tar  are probably the programs you want to use.  You can check out tar and  discover the alternatives, cpio and pax, and find out which might be most  portable in your situation.<br />I use this book for several projects at a  client site where I had to write Perl and Tcl/Tk apps.  I found it  invaluable for everything from help with Emacs to locating utilities.<br />I  should also add that the book is written very much in the style of a  reference manual, *NOT* of a tutorial or guide.  You should be comfortable  with digging in reference books before you buy this, or you might find it a  frustrating book to work with.  I think most programmers pick up this skill  very quickly, so I think this will exclude mostly beginners.	1999-12-29
US	52748657	R3OT5K6CMVMN4N	020163337X	696011044	Tcl and the Tk Toolkit	Books	5	36	38	N	N	The best way to learn Tcl/Tk, and a great reference	Although more detailed books like Welch's 'Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk' are very useful, Ousterhout's original book is still the best way to learn the language.  His style is clear and concise, and he covers the  core of the language with good examples and thorough explanatory  text.<br />The layout is clean and easy to read, without any space wasted on  fancy graphics or eye-candy.  Instead, you get clear tables laying out what  happens, or listing the commands in a certain functionality area.  For  example, page 122 has a table I've gone back to many times that lists the  different return values from catch.<br />Even though I have and use other Tcl  books, when I just want to check a point of syntax or verify functionality,  this is the one I go to.  It's an invaluable book for a Tcl/Tk developer.	1999-12-29
US	52748657	R11BO7520D45CA	1565922433	895755295	Perl Cookbook	Books	5	36	38	N	N	Useful both to explain Perl concepts and to solve problems	The &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot; condenses into code algorithms that are both beautiful and helpful.  Paired with the &quot;Programming Perl&quot; book, which despite problems of organization is undoubtedly the best Perl  reference, the cookbook is simply indispensible for both the serious Perl  programmer and anyone who wishes to learn how to write Perl  naturally.<br />Every language has a natural idiom; even COBOL.  Perl, having  convenience so strongly in its genesis, is not very similar to its  predecessors in many ways, and along with solutions to individual problems  what one learns from the cookbook is how a Perl programmer would write such  a program.  You learn twice reading these answers: not only how to solve  your problem (how do you read a file line by line in reverse?  how do you  trap signals in your program?) but also what the natural idioms are which  both simplify your code and make clearer to you how Perl works.<br />I  reviewed &quot;Programming Perl&quot; and had reservations about it: I have  none about this book.  It is not a reference to solve all your questions  about the language--buy &quot;Programming Perl&quot; for that.  It is not a  tutorial--for that, get &quot;Learning Perl&quot;.  What it is is a  distillation of some smart people's work in Perl; well-explained, clearly  laid out, and highly informative in every area a programmer is likely to  work in.  Buy it if you love Perl.	1999-12-27
US	52748657	RZVIACVNQGQ2K	1565921496	291037037	Programming Perl	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Invaluable, but very annoying as a reference	There are some great things about this book.  The information is accurate, detailed, clear, and concise.  However, there are too many places where a clear expository style is badly needed.  One example of several (see other  reviews here for other examples): if you already know what the m// operator  does, and how to combine it with =~, you are OK; but if you don't know,  there is no easy way to figure it out.  Here's what you have to do.<br />First  you go to chapter 3, the function reference, and see in the category  listing on p.143 that there is a pattern matching function called m//.  The  alphabetical listing doesn't have it, however.  If you're lucky, you notice  that they've listed it under // instead of m//, and you are referred from  there to a section of chapter 2 called regular expressions (p. 58).  But  the first mention of m// is on p.66, 8 pages later.  What's more, the first  example is:<br />/(\w+)\s*=\s*\1/;<br />which doesn't show the m// notation  (which is how it's indexed, after all), and doesn't show the =~ notation  because it makes use of $_ without saying so.<br />If instead you look up =~  in the index, you are sent to p.80, which assumes you already know about  m//, s/// and the fact that m// is //.  The definition is &quot;Binary =~  binds a scalar expression to a pattern match[. . .].&quot;.  This is not  very helpful if you're looking it up because you haven't used it before  (and only newbies are *going* to look up m// in the first place).  So an  example would be nice, something simple like:<br />$fred = &quot;abcd&quot;;  if ($fred =~ m/bc/) {     print &quot;matched!\n&quot;; }<br />but instead  they jump into fine points.<br />I repeat, a great book, and a compulsory  purchase if you are serious about Perl.  But it will drive you crazy while  you're learning.	1999-05-20
US	52748657	R1RINO750TD7RA	1565922387	750667549	Advanced Oracle PL/SQL Programming with Packages (Nutshell Handbooks)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Clearly written with good examples; not a reference work	The book is structured around a set of packages called PL/Vision.  Eighty percent of the book is devoted to describing how to use PL/Vision and what it can do.  PL/Vision is a useful set of tools; the P package in particular will be useful to any developer, though most will have already written something similar (though maybe not so fancy) for themselves.  P is a packaged version of the dbms_output routines, and allows formatted output, debug output and other similar facilities.<br />However, the book is not really a reference for Oracle packages.  Most of what you need as a reference can be found in Feuerstein's &quot;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&quot;, which I recommend. This book is more to give you an idea of what you can do with packages.  I found it interesting, but I rarely refer to it--the other Feuerstein book is so comprehensive it covers almost all my questions.	1998-05-08

When I run into a problem (e.g. when to use POST vs. GET in WebServer; or how to use the OWA utilities) there is a little information there but not enough.  However, I haven't found a better reference yet.	1998-05-05
