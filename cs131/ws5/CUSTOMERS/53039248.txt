To a man thay lambast Mr Pullman's religious views - of which they know precisely nothing. Can his views be inferred from the books? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Just having a thought that's \\"anti-Christian\\" ( whatever THAT means ) does not mean you hold that thought as your dogmatic world view. The intolerant can never understand this point because to them, the thought and the action are the same thing. That comes from that stupid \\"committed adultery in his heart\\" line from the Bible.<br /><br />This logic leads inexorably to checking your citizenry's reading habits - \\"just to be on the safe side\\".<br /><br />Great writers have always railed against authority figures. And now in our more frightening world of entrenched religious camps, its a good thing to call attention to fanaticism and to say \\"hold on, perhaps our side isn't always on the side of the angels\\" ( pun intended ).<br /><br />And as for those people who simply resort to saying \\"he can't write\\", check out the prizes Mr Pullamn has won. Heck \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" was in the running for the Booker prize in the UK - that country's most prestigious literary prize.<br /><br />These books are darkly subversive and so are excellent books for kids.<br /><br />Because if they don't learn to kick against authority when they are young, they'll just end up as the people in town hall meetings who say \\"I love you as my President\\".	2005-07-16

This was well worth the wait - a little slow? Sure, but both trilogies also were slow off the mark. But this is Linden Avery, Donaldson's most sympathetic and of course empathetic female creation.

And naturally we have THE WRITING. \\"Exigency\\" makes a happy return to us - along with many other Donaldson favorites. I cannot wait until the book appears where Linden will enter Andelain. Her meeting with her own dead is sure to be one of the highlights of this new series.

It is about her finding happiness.<br />\\"Hannibal\\" is a way more ambitious book than SOTL and<br />ultimately more satisfying too. It is nice to see an author<br />prepared to let evil win out in the end and have virtue to be<br />so completely vanquished.<br />That makes the ending exquisite - to take a character and have<br />them end up happy and contented in a life of ( from any rational<br />standpoint ), monstrous depravity.<br />And all this stuff about \\"feminist icon\\"? Hmm. Why can't she<br />still be a feminist icon? Finally emerging as an equal partner?<br />I think all this \\"feminist icon\\" nonsense came from the fact<br />that in SOTL, there were no intruding male characters ( except<br />Crawford and he was too old for her ) amd she got to figure it<br />all out and shoot the bad guy.<br />Now Dr Lecter has shown her her true nature and she is not under<br />any hypnotic or chemical influences, she can be an \\"icon\\" again,<br />fully in control, doing whatever she wants, confident and smart.<br />But just \\"playing for the other side\\".	2002-03-13

It could just as well have been set in the present day, with the hero horribly disfigured in a fire or car accident. Colonial Savannah is described not at all. There is no sense of atmosphere or place in this book - all there is is &quot;her secret passion&quot; and &quot;strange yearning&quot; type of purple prose.

Two maybe described as 'new school' and two as 'old school'. The newer novels are 'The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant' by Stephan Donaldson and 'The Book of the Old Sun'  novels of Gene Wolfe. (The Shadow Of The Torturer, The Claw Of The  Conciliator, The Sword of The Lictor and The Citadel of The Autarch). The  older novels are the Gormenghast trilogy of Mervyn Peake and of course  J.R.R.Tolkein's 'The Lord Of The Rings' of which 'The Fellowship Of The  Ring' is the first book. All of the books I have quoted have one thing in  common and that is an astonishing depth of characterization and the  invocation of a sense of a whole, new, fully consistent and fully realized  place. These novels draw you in, you believe the places are real, you  believe in their independent existence 'out there' somewhere. Once you read  any of these books, the characters are with you forever.

Or...&quot;Its name was Cirith Ungol. A place  of dreadful rumour&quot;. The 'Lord Of The Rings' novels are excellent in  both scope and imagination. A landmark of fantasy.	2000-02-01

I will not read them again; unlike the Thomas Covenant novels. These books chart the continuation of Mr Donaldson's downward spiral into misogyny which so far has reached is high  point with Morn in the Gap novels. I'm of course, sliding right by all the  uses of 'celerity' and 'exigency', but his obsession with Terisa's  &quot;aching nipples&quot; on just about every page is a little  disconcerting.	2000-02-01

Every 'professional' review of this book that I have read has been incredibly favorable. Just see the synopses given here. But for myself, I found this book very hard to read, very pretentious (&quot;I opened up the throttle and Pheadrus said 'What is truth?'&quot;) and really, really boring. I find that books in which the author revels in his intellectual superiority to me leave me cold. Of course, there are lots of people who profess to liking this book because it it seems to coat them with a veneer of intellectuality. My mother calls that 'putting on airs'. And of course as we all know, a veneer is only on the surface.	1998-02-11

My original copy that I purcahsed as a teenager has long fallen apart because of excessive rereading. This is a book that I can go back to again and again and find something new. I read it for just the thrill I get from certain passages; like when the Emperor says to Count Fenring &quot;Kill this upstart Duke&quot; and the Count &quot;Knew that he could kill him. He knew it for a fact&quot;. Yet, he declines! The later books in the Dune saga to me are all lesser works. 'Dune' will forever be, my favorite.	1998-02-11

(Adventures of a Curious Character)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	'So, Physicists Are Not All Boring, Mr.Feynman'	Physicist, bongo player, safe cracker, artist... This collection of stories is a delight. Richard Feynman's enthusiasm for everything he did ( with maybe the exception of learning Japanese ) shines through. These stories are wry and funny and come some way to explaining the great character that was Richard Feynman. Nothing for him was ever boring and no problem was ever trivial or  uninteresting. In these stories, his love of life along with his awe and reverence of Nature shines through and by that light we, perhaps, glimpse genius.	1998-02-09

There is so much to like in The Second Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant. Linden Avery is a totally believable and ( for me ) sympathetic character. I like Vain, the Sandgorgons, the meeting with Elena in Andelain; that tears my heart out every time. I like the Bloodgaurd's admonition to Linden, &quot;You must give him succour. We see that he  holds you in his heart&quot;. I like the camorra for the Giants at the end of &quot;The Wounded Land&quot;.  Strangely, I like the Second Chronicles more than the First, even though, yes, I realize that events in the first trilogy have big consequences in the second. The six books that comprise the Thomas Covenant novels stand out as the best that sf/fanatsy has to offer. I put them up there with Frank Herbert's 'Dune' and that is no mean company to be in.	1998-02-09

As usual, if you read a book and then see the movie, you are disappointed, even if the movie was pretty good. There is so much more here in the novel - the description about the difficulty of holding a freshly removed human skin comes to mind. I first read the book after hearing Roald Dahl recommend it on a particularly snooty BBC radio show about books. On the radio show, guests picked books and everyone had to read everyone else's selections. Roald Dahl chose 'The Silence Of The Lambs', the other guest chose something like 'Travels In The Holy Land With A Camera'. She was particularly incensed at Mr.Dahl's selection and had to admit she had had difficulty retaining her copy as people picked it up and did not return it. &quot;Urgh&quot;, she said and &quot;it is repulsive&quot; and &quot;once I started it, I had to finish it&quot;. That got my interest and of course, Roald Dahl's recommendation sealed it. This is a tremendous, dark, foreboding story with probably the greatest bad guy in recent times. If you still can, read the book and then maybe see the movie.	1998-02-09

Clarke's 'Rendezvous With Rama', but this book stands on its own merits. The plot is great, the technology is not unbelievable, it's just how great science fiction should be. If you read it, you will not be disappointed.	1998-02-09

Mr.Asimov is able to really spin great stories just out of the three laws of robotics. My favorite? It has to be 'Little Lost Robot', I think this is a better story than 'Nightfall', a story that perennially wins the title of &quot;Best Ever Science Fiction Short Story'. Of course, as everyone knows, the best science fiction short story of all time is &quot;A Boy And His Dog&quot; by Harlan Ellison.	1998-02-09

A few years ago in the UK ( and I'm sure on PBS in the USA ) there was a television show called &quot;Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected&quot; in which some of his  stories were dramatized. It was not too successful and I suspect that the reason was that Mr.Dahl's stories are stories to be read. That is, read on a dark night, with a strong drink close at hand, by the light of a single reading lamp.... Then you get the full effect. Yes, these stories are chilling and bizarre and simply wonderful. Though it is not in this book, everyone should  read Mr.Dahl's story entitled 'Pig'. In this reviewer's opinion that was the best story that he ever wrote. The word 'shocking' does not even come close.	1998-02-08

When you read a novel that has been translated from another language, you can sometimes sense it's a translation. Maybe some forced metaphors or strange syntactical constructs, something always gives it away. But saying that, I enjoyed the book and it was refreshing to see a heroine like Smilla; both ballsy and smart. If anything, the 'translation feel' of the book for me added to its foreignness. I don't think I have ever met an Inuit person and this book  definitely held my interest, describing cultures and people I have never encountered.	1998-01-22

But if Mr.Robertson is working for Christ's  second coming and he's telling us that it's near, doesn't that involve somewhere along the way, the destruction of the State of Isreal? Mr. Robertson's ability to turn aside hurricanes is described in this book. He managed to 'save' Virginia Beach, it's just a pity about South  Florida and destruction wrought by Hurricane Andrew. This book amply demonstrates the complete absurdity of Mr.Robertson's prayers on the '700 Club'. Read this book and learn.	1998-01-22
US	53039248	R35LBLZSRCS7ZY	0385315910	213926532	The History of Danish Dreams	Books	4	11	13	N	N	A little hard going, but worth the effort.	When I was reading this book, I was thinking &quot;will this ever end?&quot;. I am glad I persevered with it. More than six months after I finished it, characters are popping back into my head and making me smile. I think that is the highest recommendation that you can give a novel. The way all the threads of the story were interconnected and in particular how they were resolved at the end was very satisfying. But, people who enjoyed 'Smilla's Sense Of Snow' may find that 'magic realism' is not the genre for them. In fact, the two books are so unalike that they don't even feel like were written by the same author. And that I think says something about Peter Hoeg's ability.	1998-01-22

I think when you read it, you can get a feeling of how an audience, hearing the Iliad in the oral tradition must have felt. It's about action and blood and snot and heroism. In a word this poem is STIRRING. But take care, this is not a literal translation. I prefer to  think of it as a 'feeling translation'.	1998-01-22

I see clear and cogent argument. &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God&quot; is not an argument, it is a statement of faith and this book amply demonstrates why we don't have to revert to belief in a Creator when we look nature firmly in the eye. In fact, this book is worth the price just to see the evolutionary response to the Creationist cry of &quot;The eye is so complex. Eyes can't have evolved&quot;. But oh yes dear reader, they can have and this book convinces me that they did. Highly recommended.	1998-01-22

I think those are the ones about which I have some firsthand knowledge. It is good to see someone writing layman's articles about quantum physics and special relativity. But all that guff about 'The Wizard Of Oz'? Trying to cram so much erudition into one book leaves Mr.Gardner looking somewhat pompous and self-opinionated AND leaves the rest of us feeling just a little dumb. So, I suppose the question must be, who was this book written for? How many people can there be in North America who can understand and heaven forbid, critique the all-knowing Mr.Gardner?	1998-01-22
