Sneller writes mostly about her family, including stories about her aunts and uncles' childhoods, which must have been heard while she was growing up.  She also gives us a glimpse of what life around the turn of the century was like in central New York, north of Syracuse.  Some of the information, about language, food, and clothing in particular, was fascinating.  Sneller is quite frank and does not try to hide the ugliness that existed in the late 1800's, broaching such ugly topics as drunkeness, consumption, and incest.  This was a quick, enjoyable read.	2005-02-15

Tim Mix is not an instantly likeable character, but as he grows throughout the novel, he becomes so.  The relationship between Tim and his schizophrenic brother Pierce is reminiscent of Wally Lamb's I Know This Much is True--both young men seem to have been awfully damaged by their father but build a beautiful relationship in the aftermath of his death when lack of finances on Tim's part throw them together for the first time in years.  Descriptions of New Jersey, specifically travel around auto-packed central Jersey, were right on.  The humor throughout the novel was sly. It was fun to figure out at just whom Lennon was poking fun at the cartoonists' convention.  A worthwhile read!	2005-01-17

The reactions of the heroine are unbelievable, going against social mores of the time--she far too willingly goes to bed with a \\"pirate!\\"  I also have an issue with her \\"best friend\\" being a slave who will be sold off.

Donoghue managed to take a historical footnote and create a rich, 600 page novel that showcases the Beau Monde, theater, and scandalmongering during the late 1700's in England.  The effects of the French Revolution on British society and government were interesting.

The plot moves very quickly.  Naomi is not a particularly endearing character.  It is difficult to become attached to a character who is not attached to anyone around her.

When I purchased this novel to use for my thesis on adolescent lit, I didn't realize it was published by a vanity publisher (or I most certainly would not have bought it).  The first few pages were well written and edited, but then the punctuation and grammar went down hill.  Weinstein does a great job of showing how homophobia has infiltrated America's middle schools.  The story was interesting, yet incomplete.  I understand this is part of a trilogy or series, but it really is not finished--there's far too much of a cliff hanger.	2004-08-18

However, it is the young adult novel that began a trend of high quality YA lit with homosexual protagonists who are not punished for their sexuality.  The world of Annie and Liza is a far cry from today's world where gay teens populate WB dramas and teen movies (not to mention are out and proud in high schools everywhere).  These girls had no role models on TV, in novels, in movies, or, really, in life.  They depended on each other to explore questions of sexuality--I won't say they actually explore their sexuality, as there is little more than a chaste kiss in all of the novel.  They were isolated and made mistakes.  Anyone reading this can see how far the country has come in its attitudes towards homosexuals.  Annie on My Mind is a bittersweet love story worth the read.	2004-08-16

I was totally absorbed in the world of Mirabelle for a single day, as I could not put the book down!  Steve Martin has a remarkable understanding of depression--Mirabelle's struggles are so real, despite the brevity of the work.  He manages to convey so much in such little space. I've never been to LA, but he seems to capture the people and environment, juxtaposing the people of California and Vermont masterfully and showing them to be remarkably similar--shallow.  I highly recommend this brilliant fiction debut.  I am impressed.	2004-08-15

Michael Cart is well known in YA lit circles, especially for writing for and about gay teens.  However, this novel perpetuates many of the myths concerning homosexuals that Cart rails against--gay boys as bookish, gay youth as isolated, gay men as identifiable because they are more sensitive, gays coming from alcoholic/abusive homes, and the list goes on and on.  The story is compelling and well written.  It is just too rife with stereotypes for me to recommend to any teen struggling with sexual identity.	2004-08-14

This is a great introduction to the Sneaky Pie Brown series, especially if you are like me and absolutely HAVE to read a series in order.  These are really fun, quick reads.  The cats and dog have some serious attitude, and the citizens of Crozet, VA are people you would want for neighbors and friends, other than the odd murderer inhabiting the tiny town.  To a certain extent, these stories are similar to that old show Murder, She Wrote, because you just wonder how Harry constantly becomes involved in murder investigations in an otherwise peaceful town. You would think people would start avoiding her to save their own lives.  I only gave it four stars because the mysteries are too easy to figure out!	2004-08-14

Both were rich with detail and backstory for all of the characters. In this novel, Maguire left me with too many questions. How the heck does Bianca survive for years in a coma? What's with the magical cottage in the woods that the &quot;dwarves&quot; inhabit? Really, what's with the dwarves? Wicked certainly had a magical element, but it takes place in Oz, a land somewhere over the rainbow that does not follow the same rules as the one we all inhabit. With Confessions, Maguire transported Cinderella's story to Holland, but there didn't seem to be any real supernatural element that required complete suspension of disbelief. Obviously, Maguire enjoys retelling well-known stories from the point of view of characters on the fringe, but with this novel he only gives us glimpses of each character, not complete character sketches. I think no single character was well-developed. It was a quick read and largely enjoyable. I just would have liked more.	2004-08-01

Clare seemed like a strong character and then she just lost her backbone.  Niffenegger handled the time shifts reasonably well, though she never does adequately explain the final tragedy. I found Henry's attraction to Clare as a teenager, and vice versa, to be a bit creepy.  I also don't understand how this guy could keep a job when he's always disappearing, leaving behind his clothing and reappearing naked. If you are an observant reader, the obvious flaws will bother you.	2004-07-29

The dialogue no longer feels authentic and many of the situations are just too over the top.  The ending is thoroughly preposterous and feels as though Ms. Evanovich slapped it on because she had written enough.  I agree with other reviewers that there is not enough interaction between Steph and Morelli or Ranger  (Though I am happy to see more of Connie).<br />Throughout my reading of the novel, I often wondered if Janet is even still writing these, or if they are some sort of team effort like her romance novel redux.

Thursday once again has to battle one of the diabolical Acherons, save the book world from destruction, and try to un-eradicate, or at the very least remember, her husband, Landen.

While I believe Nancy Garden has done more than any writer to include homosexual characters in YA lit, her novels always seem like they are written by someone trying to get in the mind of a teenager.  Myracle manages to write a compelling story while really reflecting the attitudes of teens.  The use of flashback is great.  Unlike many authors, Myracle manages to write a gay character who is not guilt-ridden.  She is filled with doubt and must come to terms with her sexuality, and what it has done to her friendship, but she never worries that she is mentally ill or otherwise disturbed.

And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness.  Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together.  So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls.

I absolutely despise this attempt at an 18th century novel.  The language, spellings, and vocabulary are fairly true to time, but as any author who attempts to write a book in the style of another era is often just off the mark, so is Pynchon.  It reads as pretentious rather than authentic.  What could be a great tale is completely convoluted with talking dogs and other anachronistic happenings.  I know Pynchon fans everywhere will want to lynch me, but if you are not a Pynchon fan, don't bother reading this.  It's too long.

Perhaps it is because he writes plays--something most people never take the time to read.  I can only imagine how great these would be performed.  Milner's works are largely didactic--I have read reviews that liken them to Christian morality plays.  But, the didacticism is not necessarily preachy--Milner writes what he knows.  What he knows is the life of inner-city, poor, African-American youth and the temptations they face.  Dealing with those temptations--drugs, sex, easy money--is the thread that connects most of Milner's works.  Even Checkmates, which is ostensibly about the generation gap, has a certain amount of tension because of \\"easy money\\"--the older generation thinks the younger generation has it too easy.  Critical reception of Milner's works has been mixed, though predominantly reception has been poor.  He has a few stalwart supporters (Amiri Baraka and Woodie King) who feel Milner is the chronicler of the inner-city African-American youth rising out of the Black Theater movement to become the chronicler of middle class African-Americans.  I think his works are certainly worth a read.	2003-07-10

The imagery of this novel foreshadows the impact industrialization will have on the farms and open spaces of the west.  Her characters are likeable and sympathetic.  Cather clearly shows the difficulties of immigrants in the late 19th century--the prejudices they faced, the cons and swindles they could easily be duped by.  The hardest part of this novel for me was facing the reality of what Antonia, that strong, intelligent girl, becomes when she is grown up.  I wanted her to go to college right along with Jim Burden.  However, Cather wrote an realistic novel about life on the prairie in the late 1800's--there is no fantasy here.  This is beautifully written.  A story that will stick with you forever.	2003-07-09

Artemis is a kinder, gentler teenage criminal mastermind, and it's nice to see his conscience has grown.

While I was glad to finally have some of my questions answered and to be given information that will probably be important for the next two books, I found OOP quite long and overly expositive.  I once had a writing teacher who insisted we \\"show, don't tell.\\"  I think Rowling could have used this advice.  Harry doesn't even get to school until page 200!  It was nice to visit old friends after three years.  Sometimes I found it hard to drown the voices of the child actors who portrayed the main characters in the movies, but by page 400, Harry and friends where talking in the voices I heard them use before the movies came out.  There were a few inconsistencies--including one where Harry loses his wand and somehow has it back in the next chapter!  (If you know what page it was returned to him on, please let me know, because I couldn't find it anywhere!)  The changes in Harry, Ron and Hermione as they are becoming young adults are great!  Tempers flare a lot more in this latest installment.  In all, an enjoyable read.	2003-06-28

Censorship, homophobia, the religious right, sexuality, suicide--I can't think of a book that attempts to tackle so many issues at once.  Not that Garden doesn't handle all of the issues well.  I am particularly impressed with how she works in a minor physical altercation--a level of homophobia not seen in her earlier novels, and, I suspect, a reaction to the homocide of Matthew Shepard the same year.  This novel raises many questions and is a must read for gay and straight teenagers.	2003-05-22

She loves birds, and keeps many caged in her room.  Birds become an important part of the novel-symbolizing both freedom and captivity.  Her older brother, Edward, a monk, suggests that she should keep a diary to help her \\"grow less childish and more learned\\" (2).  She keeps a diary of her days, documenting everything from mundane flea-catching to her attempts to drive off would-be suitors.  Her diary gives a realistic portrayal of life in a medieval castle, with all the dirt, crudeness, small-mindedness, and hard-work intact.  Her father, Rollo, is intent on marrying her off to the richest man who will have her.  Catherine is brash and outspoken, often slapped or hit for impertinence or bad behavior.  She drives off one suitor by blackening her teeth, putting mouse bones in her hair, and acts the idiot.  To another, she pretends to be a villager and tells how Catherine has a stooped back and marks on her face, and is mad.<br />Between trying to dismiss suitors, she rails against the injustices of the life the daughter of a poor knight.  She hates lady's work-sewing, making soap, doctoring-and wishes to have adventures.  She vacillates between wanting to be a goat-herder, a traveling puppeteer, a troubadour, a crusader, or a monk--anything other than a \\"lady.\\"  Throughout the year, she is told many times by many people to stop trying to be someone or something else.  An old Jewish woman tells her, \\"'Little Bird, in the world to come, you will not be asked `Why were you not George?' or \\"Why were you not Perkin?' but `Why were you not Catherine?''\\" (17). Catherine's diary chronicles her search for self.<br />Catherine's search for identity and her growth from girl to adolescent provide the underlying theme of the novel.  When she runs away to her Aunt Ethelfritha on the eve of her marriage to a despised man, Catherine finally realizes that she cannot remake herself by becoming a crusader, goat-herder, or Saracen dancer.  She writes, \\"I cannot survive if I am not myself.  But who am I?  I am no minstrel and no wart charmer, but me, Birdy, Catherine of Stonebridge, daughter of Lord Rollo and lady Aislinn, sister to Robert and Thomas and Edward and little Eleanor, friend of Perkin, goat by and scholar\\" (202).  In a trite, end-of-the-novel rush, Catherine makes the startling revelation that she is who she is, and accepts that.<br /><br />Like modern day 14-year-olds, Catherine is prone to exaggeration and being emotional.  She asks, \\"Am I doomed to spend my days stirring great vats of goose fat when not writing for Edward?\\" and often spends her days sulking in the dovecote (12).  Everything is all or nothing with Catherine.  Despite a setting very different from modern-day America, Catherine has the same insecurities, desires, and worries that many young women do.  She is insecure about her appearance (very easy when one \\"picked off twenty-nine fleas today\\") (3).  She does not know what she wants to be when she grows up-and her options are much more limited than a modern girl's.  She suffers normal crushes and disappointments.  She struggles in her relationships with her parents and her brother, Robert.  She is a decidedly modern girl in a very un-modern time.a crusader, goat-herder, or Saracen dancer.

US	52611759	R13J5UT6VA6MIB	0140374558	888337111	Daddy-Long-Legs (Puffin Classics)	Books	5	10	16	N	N	I loved this book! **Spoiler Alert***	Daddy-Long-Legs is an epistolary novel, written as a series of letters from Jerusha \\"Judy\\" Abbot to her anonymous benefactor, whom she calls Daddy-Long-Legs.  A sixteen-year-old orphan earning her keep in the John Grier Foundling home, Jerusha has an active mind and pen.  An anonymous benefactor sends her to college to become a writer, paying all her bills and providing a wardrobe and allowance, in exchange for monthly letters on her progress.  Jerusha, having caught a glimpse of her extremely tall benefactor, begins addressing her letters to Daddy-Long-Legs.  She tells him more than her academic progress in her chatty letters.  She shares her insecurities about her social status, her crush on Jervis Pendleton, a floor mate's young uncle.  She is outspoken and opinionated, never afraid to tell her \\"Daddy\\" about her political or moral views.  She is a socialist, a suffragette, and a satirist.  She lets him know when she is angry with him, and does not take his orders submissively.  She questions everything.<br />The plot is very much based on a Cinderella tale-poor Judy Abbott, orphan, falls in love with the rich Jervis Pendleton.  The set-up of the story is not entirely realistic, and the resolution of the love story plot is rushed at the end of the novel.  Daddy-Long-Legs, who heretofore has only financed boys' education, decides to send Jerusha to college based on a funny essay criticizing the very orphanage of which he is trustee.  Mrs. Lippet, head of the orphanage, tells Jerusha, \\"On the strength of that impertinent paper, he has offered to send you to college\\" (12).  Based on Jerusha's observations of the dignity bordering on oppressiveness of the trustees, this decision seems to go against her characterization. The communication between Jerusha and her benefactor is strange-he does not want his identity to be revealed, and she cannot address him as \\"Mr. Smith.\\"  She immediately starts addressing her letters to Daddy-Long-Legs and often refers to him as simply \\"Daddy.\\"  He is obviously a father figure to Judy, which is disturbing when it is revealed that Daddy-Long-Legs is also her love-interest, Jervis Pendleton.  After Daddy-Long-Legs' identity is revealed, Webster quickly ties up the novel in a few paragraphs, but never resolves the father-figure as love interest.  Judy writes in her final letter concerning addressing her Daddy-Long-Legs as Jervis, \\"Just plain Jervie sounds disrespectful, and I can't be disrespectful to you!\\" (160).<br />The first person point-of-view of this novel allows the reader to get into the head of the main character, but limits characterization of others in the novel to Judy's impressions.  She says of two of her classmates, \\"Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world-and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least so. ...Sallie thinks everything is funny-even flunking-Julia is bored at everything.  She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable.  She believes that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further examination.  Julia and I were born to be enemies\\" (22).  Despite the fact that Judy has such opinions of Julia, they become roommates, travel to New York City together, and Julia invites Judy to spend Christmas with her.<br />Through her attempts at friendship, Julia doesn't seem as bad as Judy writes.  However, because the point-of-view is limited, Julia is an uninteresting snob.<br />Despite limitations, the voice and opinions revealed through the point of view seem authentic to the time and place of the novel.  After learning her crush, Jervis, is a socialist, she decides to do some research on socialism.  In her next letter to Daddy-Long-Legs, she writes, \\"Hooray!  I'm a Fabian.  That's a Socialist who's willing to wait.  We don't want the social revolution to come tomorrow morning; it would be too upsetting\\" (119).  The enthusiasm with which Judy embraces socialism, shopping, and Jervis Pendleton is typically adolescent.  Her triumphs and failures expressed with enthusiasm or despair, and her letters reflect the vacillation of adolescent emotions.<br />Key adolescent experiences and problems include embarrassment concerning family background and the flush of first love.  Judy is justifiably embarrassed by being an orphan and wary of sharing her background with her upper class schoolmates.  Most teenagers experience a certain amount of family embarrassment.  Of course, for most teenagers, being raised in an orphanage is not something that they are familiar with.  Judy's infatuation with Jervis Pendleton is also typically adolescent-she loves him, but doesn't realize she loves him.  She cannot stop writing about him, and thinks about him a lot.  She doesn't realize she's in love until late in the novel.  To the reader, Judy clearly has a crush.  It is interesting to watch her deal with her crush as an observer, hoping she is brave enough to share her feelings, and knowing that she already has in her letters to Daddy-Long-Legs.lures expressed with enthusiasm or despair, and her letters reflect the vacillation of adolescent emotions.<br />Key adolescent experiences and problems include embarrassment concerning family background and the flush of first love.

US	52611759	R2KX94M9I7FK9U	0440414806	159975375	Holes	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Holes is great!	Holes is the engaging story of Stanley Yelnats, accused of stealing the stinky sneakers of a famous baseball player that were supposed to be auctioned for charity.  He is innocent, but, like everyone in his family since his \\"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather,\\" he was in the wrong place at the wrong time (7).  He is sent to Camp Green Lake where there is nothing green and no lake.  He and the other boys spend each day digging individual five by five holes in the now-dry lake bed.  They rise early to avoid the hottest part of the Texas day, but cannot return to their tents until their whole is complete.  They also have to avoid the yellow-spotted lizard-one bite is deadly.  Stanley is heavy and out of shape, and digging holes is very hard work for him.  Stanley makes a deal with a camper, Zero, to teach him to read for one hour a night in return for one hour's worth of digging.  Zero runs away, and Stanley chases after his new friend.  Juxtaposed with the primary tale of Stanley and Zero is the story of Stanley's great-great-grandfather, a famous lady-gunslinger named Kate Barlow, and Kate's love, a black man named Sam who is killed for kissing a white woman.  The tale of Kate and Stanley's grandfather eventually resolves the mystery of Camp Green Lake and what the \\"campers\\" are searching for all day in the hot sun.<br />This story is built around the absurdity of Stanley's crime and punishment.  However, beyond the absurd circumstances of his incarceration, Sachar manages to build a community and explore the importance of friendships-especially among those who don't necessarily fit in.  Even though he was the biggest boy in his class, Stanley was bullied and tormented.  Sachar writes, \\"The teachers never took Stanley's complaint seriously, because Derrick was so much smaller than Stanley.  Some teachers even seemed to find it amusing that a little kid like Derrick could pick on someone as big as Stanley\\" (23).  Stanley is obviously sensitive and non-confrontational to allow Derrick to bully him, but on his first day at Camp Green Lake, he becomes \\"Caveman.\\"  His new bunkmates warn a larger boy, \\"You don't want to mess with the Caveman\\" (44).  By sticking together and giving each other nick-names, the boys create a community in a very inhospitable place.  They help each other with advice about digging holes and avoiding the counselors.  Stanley and Zero help each other both at camp, and in the desert.<br />Characterization is very important in this novel.  Sachar makes it clear from the beginning that Stanley, a nice boy, is not used to taking responsibility for his actions.  Everything in his, and his father's, and his father's father's, life has been blamed on his great-great-grandfather, who was cursed by a Gypsy.  Sachar writes, \\"Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to blame someone\\" (8).  Stanley is a character who is acted upon, rather than one who takes action.  He allows Derrick to bully him.  He allows X-Ray to take credit for finding something in the dry river bed, losing a half-day of freedom.  When he finally takes some action by running away to try and find Zero, things start to go better for Stanley.  He still has doubts about his ability to make things happen, but Zero tells him, \\"When you spend your whole life living in a hole, the only way you can go is up\\" (159).  Stanley takes this sentiment to heart, and manages to dig his way out of the hole that is his life.<br />Learning to take responsibility for one's actions is the key experience in this novel.  Students will relate to Stanley's growth from someone who is ready to blame his long dead great-great-grandfather for everything that goes wrong in his life to someone who takes an active part in what is going on, willing to accept the consequences.nd non-confrontational to allow Derrick to bully him, but on his first day at Camp Green Lake, he becomes \\"Caveman.\\"  His new bunkmates warn a larger boy, \\"You don't want to mess with the Caveman\\" (44).

The oppressive heat of August, along with the oppressiveness of her home, inspires her to run away in search of the \\"elf music\\" her grandmother has heard from the woods next to the family home since she was a child.  Lost in the woods, she runs into a teenage boy drinking from a hidden spring.  Jesse Tuck does not let Winnie drink from the spring, but he and his family kidnap her to prevent her from telling anyone about it.  Scared and far from home for the first time, Winnie does not understand why the family is so afraid of her drinking from the spring.  The family is so unlike her own-warm, relaxed, and loving-that she warms to them even before they tell the family's tale of drinking from the spring and becoming immortal.  She becomes attached to the family and risks her own safety to break the mother out of jail.<br />The author does an excellent job of introducing the fantasy element.  Before sharing the mystery of the Tuck family, Babbitt writes, \\"It was the strangest story Winnie had ever heard\\" (37).  The reader and Winnie both find the story unbelievable, but the supporting details-Jesse falling from a tree and breaking his neck, the horse being shot, Miles's wife and children aging, leaving and dying while he stayed 19-make Winnie believe their story.  Miles's experience tempers Jesse's excitement about living forever.  There are other ramifications to immortality besides adventure.<br />The setting is well drawn and provides the perfect atmosphere for the novel.  The juxtaposition of the ordered Foster home in the oppressive August heat with the \\"homely little house\\" nestled in a cool glade by a pond opens up a world of possibilities to Winnie (50).  Not only is the Tuck story fantastic, the disorder of their home-\\"the gentle eddies of dust, the silver cobwebs, the mouse who lived-and welcome to him!-in a table drawer\\"-are so foreign but welcome to her.  Babbitt writes, \\"Into it all came Winnie, eyes wide, and very much amazed. It was a whole new idea to her that people could live in such disarray, but at the same time she was charmed\\" (52).  The Tuck's tale opens her eyes to fantastic possibilities-their home makes her realize that there are other ways to live.  She realizes that she can escape the confines of her own home and family to be comfortable.<br />Winnie is dissatisfied with her strict, oppressive life.  She learns that there are other ways to live, to be happy, and to be safe.  Many teens find their own lives oppressive-too many demands from school, society and parents.  They often think about running away, fleeing the oppressiveness.  However, after her immediate adventures with the Tucks are through, Winnie does decide against the uncertainty of adventure and immortality.

US	52611759	R1RQXJ5Y46GVL7	0440995779	879872706	The Witch of Blackbird Pond	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Interesting story, hokey love plot	The Witch of Blackbird Pond centers around Kit Tyler, a 16-year-old Royalist from Barbados who journeys to Connecticut after her grandfather dies in 1687.  She is unprepared for the vast difference between her sumptuous, free life in Barbados and the puritanical economy of Connecticut.  From the beginning, she is obviously different-her clothing, her attitudes, her education, politics and religion.  She fears she will never fit in, and is not sure she wants to.  She befriends Hannah Tupper, against her uncle's wishes,  an old woman who lives isolated on Blackbird Pond because she is a Quaker, a reviled religion at the time, and suspected of being a witch.  The two isolated, \\"different\\" women create a small community that includes Nat, the son of the captain of the ship that transported Kit to New England, and Prudence, a neglected child Kit teaches to read.  After trying unsuccessfully to fit in for months without giving up her own identity, Kit finally manages to become part of her uncle's family when her cousins become ill and she has to take over caring for the sick and all of the household duties.  But the illness, which strikes many in the village, causes the suspicious and close-minded villagers to persecute the \\"witch\\" living on Blackbird Pond.  Kit risks her own life to save Hannah.  Despite her hard work and attempts to fit in, Kit is arrested and stands trial for being a witch.<br />Kit's attempts to fit in while maintaining her independence are a very realistic adolescent experience.  Used to a very free lifestyle, Kit does not realize she is doing things that others find shocking or strange.  The first time she meets residents of her new home, she jumps into a river to save Prudence's doll.  Invigorated by her brief swim, her spirits are dampened by the reactions of the others in the boat.  Speare writes, \\"Shock and horror and unmistakable anger stared back at her\\" (9).  Her innocent attempt to return a little girl's doll is met with immediate suspicion.  Kit has no idea most people in New England cannot swim-she grew up swimming in the warm waters of the Caribbean.  Kit's failure to fit in while not even realizing that she is doing things wrong is true to adolescents today, as well as in 1687.  Teens feel isolated for so many reasons: they think they don't dress right, or they aren't accepted by the right clique, or they feel smarter or less smart than their classmates.<br />Kit's main internal conflict centers on her desire to be independent while fitting in with the staunch Puritan society.  She knows that her family and the villagers would not approve of her friendship with Hannah Tupper, but sneaks away to meet Hannah and Prudence anytime she is free.  Kit asks Hannah, \\"What would happen if they found us out?\\" (173).  Hannah gives her no answer, she merely states, \\"I know that soon thee would begin to consider that\\" (173).  It is up to Kit to reconcile disobeying her family's implied order to stay away from Hannah with her desire to continue her friendship with Hannah, Prudence, and Nat.  Kit's conscience wins out-she rescues Hannah from the mob at great risk to herself.  She tells her uncle, \\"She's just a poor helpless old woman!\\" before she sneaks out to assist her (184).  In helping Hannah, Kit resolves her internal conflict between being accepted and being true to herself.  She chooses to be true to herself.Kit has no idea most people in New England cannot swim-she grew up swimming in the warm waters of the Caribbean.   Kit's failure to fit in while not even realizing that she is doing things wrong is true to adolescents today, as well as in 1687.  Teens feel isolated for so many reasons: they think they don't dress right, or they aren't accepted by the right clique, or they feel smarter or less smart than their classmates.  <br />Kit's main internal conflict centers on her desire to be independent while fitting in with the staunch Puritan society.  She knows that her family and the villagers would not approve of her friendship with Hannah Tupper, but sneaks away to meet Hannah and Prudence anytime she is free.  Kit asks Hannah, \\"What would happen if they found us out?\\" (173).  Hannah gives her no answer, she merely states, \\"I know that soon thee would begin to consider that\\" (173).  It is up to Kit to reconcile disobeying her family's implied order to stay away from Hannah with her desire to continue her friendship with Hannah, Prudence, and Nat.  Kit's conscience wins out-she rescues Hannah from the mob at great risk to herself.  She tells her uncle, \\"She's just a poor helpless old woman!\\" before she sneaks out to assist her (184).

Jerusha \\"Judy\\" Abbot comes to life in her letters to Daddy-Long-Legs, the anonymous benefactor who pays for her college education. (I particularly love the up-close look at women's higher education in the early 20th century--though the college is never stated, and is probably Vasser, I can imagine it is my own alma mater, Wells).  Her hopes, fears, and frustrations are very real--from insecurity about being an orphan to her struggles with Latin.  While some experiences and circumstances are dated, the emotions and life situations of Judy are timeless.  Judy is an outspoken woman in a time when women didn't even have the right to vote; she is a socialist, a reformer, and an author.  She is not perfect, but she is wonderful.  This is a must read for any young woman!	2003-02-13

It is the fairly fast-paced tale of Rafe McKettrick, one of three brothers forced to compete to be the first to produce an heir in order to inherit a sizeable ranch, and Emmeline Harding, niece of a brothel madam, and, maybe, a prostitute, who is his mail-order bride.  This novel is thick with fun, interesting characters, love (so many couples!!), and a certain amount of mystery in the shape of one &quot;Sister Mandy&quot; who everyone doubts is actually a nun. I look forward to seeing how marriage turns out for the other McKettrick boys.	2003-01-16

Amy Tan once again manages to weave storylines of modern Chinese-American women w/ those of earlier Chinese women.  However, I have a hard time liking her Chinese-American women.  They are so flawed, and usually so critical of their mothers, that I wonder what sort of terrible childhood, mother-daughter relationship Tan is working through with her writing.  These American women, unlike their Chinese mothers, seem to blame everything on Mom (typical American?), while the Moms survive and usually gain a measure of success without ever laying blame on the backwards time or village they grew up in, they flourish despite wars, terrible husbands, and miserable families.  Anyway, this novel was particularly interesting because the inspiration came from real life.  Despite finding the strained  mother/daughter thing to have been done to death by Tan (can you name a novel of hers where a tough mother/daughter relationship was not at the center?), I actually enjoyed this novel very much.  The daughter's struggle with mom's dementia was particularly moving and well written.	2003-01-16

Of course, things can't be that simple.  Neighborhood decorating warfare ensues, leading to a near arrest.  Gossip and pettiness abounds.

While it is refreshing to read a critique of American education that doesn't blame everything on the teachers, one must read this book as critically as Berliner and Biddle read the Bush administration report.  Certainly, as an education grad. student, I found the idea that our government, by publishing A NATION AT RISK, falsified statistics, and, basically, made a flawed educational system seem disasterous.  However, I feel it necessary to consider B & B's agenda--very liberal, and as another reviewer pointed out in discussing exchange rates and the per student expenditure of foreign countries, the pair may be as guilty of \\"shady statistics\\" as they accuse the authors of A NATION AT RISK.  In all, I find this book provides a nice balance to all those education doomsayers, but must be taken with the same grain of salt.	2002-12-05

But if you enjoy sophisticated language and language manipulation (read: English majors), this is a wonderfully creative book.<br />Dunn creates an idyllic island nation, Nollopton (formerly Utopiana), that quickly descends to a military state reminiscent of Orwell's 1984, with neighbor turning in neighbor and students reporting teachers when letters from that famous panagram, &quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog,&quot; start falling off the statue to honor the sentence and the man who created it, Nevin Nollop.  The High Council, politicians elected for life, take this as a sign from Nollop himself, disregarding the fact that the glue that holds the letters on is over 100 years old.<br />And so, the people of Nollop, who because of inconsistent phone service are a letter-writing people, must, one by one, eliminate letters from their lives or face serious punishment, including banishment for the third offense.  The letters become truly hilarious as more of the alphabet disappears--just imagine a world with no &quot;D&quot;!  Dunn manages, despite all of this alphabetical mayhem, to build in love interests for the two young cousins who most consistently write to one another.  A completely enjoyable afternoon read that I think has found a place as one of my favorite books.	2002-12-05

While I am mired in the realities of grad studies in education--lesson plans, theory, pedagogy, etc.--this book helped remind me of why I wanted to pursue teaching in the first place.  Counts calls for teachers to become leaders, not just in their schools or local communities, but as an effective, powerful political force.  We are the ones in the trenches, aren't we the experts on education in America?  Shouldn't we know how to fix it?  Shouldn't we try?<br />The book is a bit dated--I couldn't help by shake my head in disgust when I read Counts ideas of what a teacher's union could and should do and compared it to my limited experience with those organizations.  He presents an idealized movement where social problems that are the root of educational problems are addressed/eliminated, where teachers are respected leaders and seen as the professionals they are, and where our schools, in the end, effectively serve more students than they currently do.	2002-12-05

Davis presents a side of the suffragette movement, the first wave of feminism, that many people will never be aware of--the conflict between women's rights and African American rights, and the underlying racism of the movement spearheaded by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  Davis then effectively juxtaposes the first wave of feminism with the second wave of feminism in the 1960-70's to show the correlation between the two movements.<br />In both cases, the fight for African American rights took prescedence over the rights of women.  While during the first wave of feminism, black women were ignored by the suffragettes, during the second wave of feminism, black women were faced with the choice of going forward in a women's movement that, once again, didn't really include them, or supporting the rights of African Americans as a race.  A difficult choice.  Davis clearly elucidates the failings of the both waves of feminism to include ALL women and shows how necessary it is for women, regardless of race, to work together.	2002-12-05

Waters accurately captures the seedier side of Victorian England--the pickpockets and fences, erotic book dealers and collectors, madhouses and inmates--in a richly complex novel that starts out slow but becomes un-put-downable at the end of Part 1.  The characters are well-written; the dialogue seems real; the intrigue is engrossing.  Unlike much of the trite, stereotypical works that pass for \\"good\\" lesbian fiction, Waters manages to write three dimensional lovers facing realistic obstacles to be together.  Waters even manages to pay a certain amount of homage to Victorian erotica--where the lesbian novel got its start by tittilating repressed men--by taking the themes that one comes across in such novels (bad girls vs. good girls who always seem to come under the power of very bad men, etc.) and turning them into something realistic.  This is a gritty novel that evokes the underside of the Victorian era in all its sensual reality.	2002-12-04
US	52611759	R36IODGG1EBPGP	0061032425	325593509	The Family	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The original "family"	Though choppy, this fictionalized tale of the Borgias was a quick, satisfying read.  Puzo transports the reader to Italy at the time Columbus discovers the New World, to a world where popes have children and mistresses, the cardinal's hat is bought and bartered, sons and daughters are political pawns to be married for gain or connection, the Church is rich, rich, rich and oh so corrupt.  Better than any modern soap opera, I understand why Puzo refers to the Borgias as \\"the first Family.\\"  More powerful than any don, Rodrigo Borgia becomes Pope and uses his children to gain alliances and riches.  Despite their father's teaching that the family always comes first, the Borgia children have their own alliances and enemies within the family, further adding to the intrigue of the already politically trecherous Rome in the late 1400's.  Puzo's focus is on the family--he writes about each Borgia in their turn--but he also does a wonderful job of supplying the historical context of treaties and wars(The map at the beginning of the book doesn't hurt!).<br />Lucrezia fairs better in this novel than in history, becoming an almost likable character.  I enjoyed the richness of this historical novel.	2002-12-03

I also agree that it reads more like late 1990's lesbian relationship than 1980.  For a more accurate picture of lesbian relationships and coming out in the early 80's, read Annie on My Mind, written during that time.  Once you've read that novel, you will realize just how utopian and false this novel reads (for the time in which it is supposed to be set).  I found it easier to get into the novel by just switching the time in my head.  Brown does write an incredibly steamy sex scene or two, and the characters exude that Southern charm Brown writes so well.  This novel does not rank among her best but was enjoyable.	2002-12-03

Aerin is stronger and smarter than any female protagonist I have come across in the genre.  The storyis compelling.  McKinley effectively uses flashbacks to show instead of tell why Aerin is stand-offish, stubborn, and nearly invisible in her father's court.  Aerin possesses a bravery that neither Harry Potter nor Lyra do--she goes willingly to face evil and save her world, knowing full well the magnitude of her quest.  The supporting characters are brilliantly drawn, from Tor, her only friend, to Gallana, her nemesis at court, to Talat, her horse, each has a personality and a place in the tale.  I highly recommend this novel and look forward to reading others by McKinley.	2002-12-03

While I did find some of Lyra's actions to be atypical of the feisty, brave girl that we met in The Golden Compass, I understand that Pullman had to introduce the character of Will to continue to flesh out the Paradise Lost parallels, and to give Lyra someone to journey with.  There is a lot of death in this and the third book, and a lot of religious themes that some might find offensive or confusing (though one must remember that this is a novel, not an editorial or non-fiction piece; it is fake).  I like Will and still love Lyra.  I found this to be the weakest of the trilogy, but a must read to fully appreciate the series.	2002-11-20

This is a coming of age novel--both for the girl and her Viet Nam vet uncle.  As Sam learns more about the war and her father's part in it, those readers who did not go to war or were not alive at the time, gain a deeper appreciation for the sacrifices and struggles of Viet Nam vets today.  There are many interesting juxtapositions of the different kinds of vets, the non-functional to the highly functional.  Each carries baggage from that war.

The characters are thinly drawn--Alfred's treatment of Enid belongs in a world fifty years ago, as does Gary's treatment of his wife.  Chip is a screw-up of the most annoying kind--brilliant and bored. The sibling rivalry and parental preference is outlandish and sickening.

The story seems unrealistic and overly dramatic to me.  The mother has no redeeming qualities and is infuriating in her desire to control/destroy her daughter.  I read the novel because I like to read the book before seeing the movie.  The novel took away my desire to see the film.	2002-10-20

The Kiss and Exposure were great books. The Binding Chair does not disappoint. Harrison makes early 1900's China come alive. Her descriptions of foot binding and bound feet are detailed and horrifying.<br />The main character is May, a Chinese prostitute with bound feet who manages to marry the brother-in-law of a British businessman living with his family in China.  She quickly becomes a commanding figure in the house.  The flashbacks to her foot binding and early marriage are fascinating. An engaging, gripping story.	2002-10-20

If you are considering buying it as a foray into the world of Evanovich's brassy Jersey girl bounty hunter, do yourself a favor and start earlier in the series.<br />While Stephanie's mad cap exploits made me laugh, I found some of the situations to be over-the-top ridiculous.  I agree with the reviewer who wonders how, and why, Stephanie has not only not improved her bounty hunting skills, but has gotten worse!  I love Stephanie, but she does seem to be getting dumber (maybe it's the Jersey water or too many hairspray fumes!).  Not that she should ever become too apt at apprehending FTA's, but a little improvement would be nice.  She has often said that she doesn't make the same mistake twice, but that no longer seems to be the case.  The sudden coldness between Stephanie and Morelli was also off-putting, as well as the near obsession with Ranger.<br />Of course, I will read number 9 when it comes out, but I might not be so quick to buy it on the day it is released.	2002-08-19

He was my age when he wrote this, and I cannot imagine my first work being so beautiful and well crafted. The point of view changes are smooth, plot development takes some interesting turns.  It is a gripping story.  I look forward to reading more works by the author.	2002-08-19

These books are just plain fun!  If you are going through some serious Harry withdraw endlessly waiting for the fifth book, these will help to ease some of your symptoms.

Tristan &amp; Iseult!	&quot;The Romance of Tristan &amp; Iseult&quot; is the tale of one of the earliest pairs of star-crossed lovers in literature, heavily researched and drawing from many versions of the story.  Having come across the tale in many forms, from the opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; to cameo appearances in &quot;The Mists of Avalon,&quot; this telling is refreshing and spirited.  The authenticity of language, as well as the narrator's own action and moral interpretations make one feel that they are sitting near a fire in the great hall listening to a seneschal tell the tale of doomed love.<br />&quot;Tristan &amp; Iseult&quot; is fast-paced and beautiful.  It is also an invaluable tale to read as an example of the archetypes and symbols of the tragic hero, imbedded Christ imagery, woman on a pedestal, etc.	2001-11-12

Anna Karenina is a great novel, one of the greatest novels ever written.  Is it long? Yes.  Is the agrarian/socialist subplot seemingly out of left field and boring? After a while.  Is this book worth reading? Absolutely.  Anna Karenina as a love story/saga is on par with Gone With the Wind or Cather's The Song of the Lark.  It drags in some places and there are too many characters to count (though Tolstoy does a wonderful job of introducing each character as one might be introduced to new acquintances-you meet person A who introduces you to persons B &amp; C, B introduces you to D &amp; E, etc.-it's not that difficult to keep them straight), but the romance and richness of plot are enough to keep going.  If you enjoy sweeping tales that follow the lives of numerous people and provide tremendous insight into attitudes and mores of a particular time and place, read this.	2001-11-07
US	52611759	RLZZEYXUPW8UB	0451527666	691105951	Ethan Frome (Signet Classics)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Not as bad as everyone says	Perhaps this is one book that shouldn't be assigned in English classes throughout the country.  It seems that noone who is &quot;forced&quot; to read Ethan Frome actually enjoys it. I picked this up during an Edith Wharton phase and really enjoyed it.  It is short and gripping.  Ethan is a pathetic character who has to deal with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.  By trying to escape his shrewish wife, he only tied himself to her more completely.  Ethan Frome is a sad novel about doomed romance and the desperation of New England winters.  I would not recommend it as an Edith Wharton primer, try Summer or The Buccaneers first.  Once you have gotten hooked on Wharton, give Ethan Frome a try.	2001-11-07
US	52611759	R2SIJZGSBEM6VY	0684842580	872664967	Summer	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Summer stands alone	Summer and Ethan Frome are often referred to as companion novels.  The only thing these two novels have in common is location and doomed romance.  While doomed romance seems to be a major theme in much of Wharton's work, this book pushes the envelope by dealing not only with sex (The House of Mirth also implies some sexuality), but also abortion.  I found this novel more engaging than Ethan Frome, perhaps because the central character is a young woman, flawed and realistic, who is able to deal with the consequences of her failed romance (however horrid they may be) rather than a brooding man who seems to think if he can't be in the relationship he wants, leaving his shrewish wife for a sweet young woman, he would rather not live. By the end, I was hoping for a happy ending for Charity.	2001-11-07
US	52611759	R2ZJJC3DTW0RT0	0395345308	436553278	The Song of the Lark	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A long, worthwhile read	The Song of the Lark is not the easiest Cather novel.  It is beautifully written, richly descriptive and full of interesting, multi-dimensional characters.  Thea Kronberg, a small town girl with a big city talent, strives to become an opera singer with the help and support of family and friends.  At the beginning of the novel she is endearing and delightful, you want her to be in the limelight.  But as she becomes more deeply involved in the competitive world of opera, she becomes bitter, vindictive and ungrateful.  She forgets the people who helped her cultivate her talent in her ruthless drive to be the best.  Thea is flawed and beautiful.  Her great talent and modest beginnings create a heroine you want to root for, but when she realizes the full potential of that talent and ignores her modest beginnings, she becomes the heroine you love to hate.  This is definitely not the Cather novel for the uninitiated.  Though, if you are a singer, yearning to become an opera diva, read this.  Thea's realities are the realities of today's opera world-unfair, unstable and lonely.	2001-11-07
US	52611759	R1IUL974XGUKPF	0064471284	751783969	Deliver Us from Evie	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Not so much about Evie	While the title would imply that this novel was about Evie, it really is about Parr, a young man struggling with his desire to get off the farm, have a girlfriend and deal with his family.  Evie is really a secondary character, and one that is pretty one-dimensional.  Evie and her girlfriend fall into the butch femme stereotype and never grow past it.  As far as being an accurate portrayal of what it is like to be gay in a small town, I don't think so.  Both sets of parents took the affair between the girls pretty mildly and seemed to give up protesting all together when they &quot;proved&quot; they really wanted to be together.<br />If you are looking for a good, realistic depiction of lesbian relationships, read something else.	2001-11-07
US	52611759	R34FM4M50SMNZ7	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Long and enchanting	The Mists of Avalon presents an interesting take on the Arthurian Legend--the women's points of view. Bradley does an excellent job of drawing her female characters as rich human beings as enmeshed in the intrigue and chaos of early Britain as are the men who are at war. Perhaps more so, because they bear and raise the next generation of warriors and mothers while being left to themselves in isolated castles.<br />  I did, however,find the character of Gwynhyfar the least three dimensional, she starts out as an agoraphobic Christian, but somewhere that agoraphobia dissipates and Christianity turns to zealot. Unfortunately, we don't really see that transition.<br />  Bradley also did an excellent job of bringing real historical figures, namely St. Patrick who has finished converting the Irish and is hell bent on converting the British heathen.<br />  Her characters are rich and whole. They certainly have their flaws and failings. Sometimes the novel tended to be slow or jumpy, but at 900 or so pages, I couldn't really fault those few less than stellar moments.<br />  One of the main themes-Christianity vs. Paganism- was enlightening. I had never before thought of the Arthur legend as taking place at a time when Christianity wasn't firmly established throughout the land. I don't know how authentic Bradley's portrayals of pagan ritual really are, but they seemed real to me.<br />BTW-- the book is soooo much better than the miniseries!	2001-09-20

Stories deal with such varied topics as homosexuality, the Holocaust, Native American mysticism and small time crooks. Women writers are well represented. This collection features some very different choices, including a ghost story from Joyce Carol Oates.<br />This collection will prove an invaluable resource for budding writers and literature majors alike. This would also be a great primer for someone unfamiliar with the most contemporary short fiction.	2001-09-20

Montgomery Books)	Books	2	14	18	N	N	Disappointing after Anne	Looking forward to reading some of Montgomery's other works, I spent several days laboring over Magic for Marigold.  The book is well written, sometimes enjoyable and entertaining, often slow and boring.  Marigold is no Anne.  She isn't Rilla, either.  She has no spunk, no fire-- and that is what I always loved about Anne and all of the women in the Green Gables series.<br />That is not to say that Marigold doesn't get into Anne-like scrapes.  She just doesn't get out of them in Anne-like ways.<br />The Princess Varvara incident is a great example.  Marigold is lead-practically dragged- into mischief by a mysterious girl who insists that she is a princess.  Not only is Marigold unable to be bad on her own, but she can't be good on her own either.  She lacks decisiveness and a will.  Perhaps that comes from being raised in a household with an over-domineering great-grandmother, a domineering grandmother and a push over mother.<br />A true L. M. Montgomery fan will have to read this book to experience another side of Montgomery, just don't have your heart set on meeting an engaging, enchanting girl.  The most enchanting thing about Marigold is her name.	2001-09-20

This is one of two historical mysteries featuring real people that I have read (Seneca Falls Inheritance being the other) and perhaps I just don't enjoy the genre.  Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor is contrived at best.  There are far too many betooks and bethought me's (in one sentence, mind you!) for my taste.  The real Jane Austen didn't write like that.  It is missing the characteristic Jane voice that is sarcastic, feminist, judgemental and proper all at the same time.  The footnotes and accuracies of Jane's life are interesting, but probably not interesting enough to make me pick up the second in the series.  If you are a true Jane Austen fan, from Emma to Northanger Abbey, you'll probably read this book anyway, but I don't advise it.  And if historical mysteries are your thing, it is probably worth your while.  For everyone else, STAY AWAY!!!	2001-09-19

For that reason, I found that &quot;A Music I No Longer Heard&quot; was lacking in substance.  The authors did relay a tremendous amount of anecdotal evidence of the impact of early parent loss, but there just did not seem to be much scientific/psychological support, nor did the authors assert any new theories/ideas about early parent loss.  I found Maxine Harris' book, &quot;The Loss that is Forever&quot; to be much more helpful and inclusive.	2001-09-19

Maxine Harris captures the tremendous impact of early parent loss through both anecdotal and scientific support.  This book is a tremendous asset to anyone who has experienced early parent loss.  For women dealing specifically with mother loss, Harris' book works well in conjunction with Hope Edelman's &quot;Motherless Daughters.&quot;  I would say this is a must have for anyone who has lost a parent before they were 21 and are still trying to come to terms.	2001-09-19

Evanovich does it again in this seventh installment of her Stephanie Plum series.  As usual, fast-talking Stephanie bites off more than she can chew when she has to bring in Eddie DeChooch.  She's got Joyce on her tail, mob guys on her tail, and Joe Morelli AND Ranger on her tail (though they're the only two who don't want to do her bodily harm).  Of course there's a brand new car which must be disposed of.  This novel was as enjoyable as the previous six, though the cliffhanger endings are starting to kill me.  If you are looking for a light read with New Jersey attitude, pick this up.	2001-09-18

Her tone and use of subtle sarcasm is similar to that of Jane Austen.  If you love Austen, give Wharton a try.  Definitely lighter in tone than Ethan Frome, but equally  substantial.	1998-11-04
