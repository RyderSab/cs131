My family and I recently had a 10 day visit to Orlando and I ran out and bought &quot;Walt Disney World with Kids 2000&quot;, &quot;The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2000&quot;, and Birnbaum's. I read them all from cover to cover, made lots of calls and now consider myself to be an expert  on the subject of how to cram the best stuff into the best days for your  florida trip. After reading &quot;The Unnoficial Guide&quot;, Birnbaum's  book was a big dissapointment. His book did not give half of the  information that &quot;The Unofficial Guide&quot; gave. About the only good  thing I can say is it does make a nice souvineer book, but If you are like  me and want as much info on every subject you can think of smashed into  your brain, get &quot;The Unofficial Guide&quot;. We are going back again  next February and I won't waste my time or money on anything but.	2000-04-20

Once in a while, I will get on a different author kick and I will not read a Small book for months, but then I go back and I am  always glad I did. Blaze...the perfect name for her. It is always hard to  say who is better for the heroine. You love them all. Tony was destined to  have her but Edmund made you melt. I am always reminded after reading one  of Miss Small's books just exactly why I love her so much. This book is out  of print, but definitely worth your search. Read it!	1999-09-27

I have two words to describe this book. NOT EXCITING! This book is completely boring! I had a really hard time getting through this one. Don't  get me wrong, Sebastian and Juliana did have a sweet love for each other  (although I had a hard time with his disability...YUCK) but there was  absulutely nothing at all exciting about this book. I was not blissfully  anticipating the next page or chapter. I did not squirm and my heart  strings never ached. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about. All  in all, more than a little dissapointing. I will not be in line to buy the  next one.	1999-09-27

I am a huge fan of Ms. McNaught's and I have read all of her historicals. I truly believed Judith to be incapable of writing a less than perfect novel. Well, my bubble just burst. I just finished &quot;Until You&quot; and I was very surprised. The first 100 (or so) pages were completely and  utterly boring! I was tempted so many times to put this book back on the  shelf and not pick it up again. I had to force myself to keep reading. I am  happy to say that it did pick up as soon and Clayton and Whitney showed up  and it did have a good ending so I gave it 4 stars however, The family  thing was a little far out there but hey, nobody's perfect even though I  was beginning to think Judith was. This one is not bound for the keepers  shelf but &quot;A Kingdom of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Almost Heaven&quot;,  &quot;Once and Always&quot;, &quot;Whitney my Love&quot; and  &quot;Something Wonderful&quot; will be there to eternity.	1999-09-08

I loved how she kept telling him that she was never going to speak to him again and then a minute later they  were in a deep conversation. She had me in stitches when she told Duncan  that if he was killed, she would find his grave and spit on it. Very cute  book. I think the thing that I like most about Julie's books is that both  the hero and heroine are very endearing characters.	1999-07-26

Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book at the end but I thought it was a little slow and boring through the first half. I did not even smile until 3/4 into it.

The only thing good about this book was the very first chapter and because of that chapter, I thought the book was going to be a page turner. I was completely mislead. This book was totally boring. It did not reach me at an  emotional level at all. I did not find any part of this book exciting in  the least and at times, I had to force myself not to put it down and never  pick it back up because the author babbled on about stupid stuff. I had  looked forward to reading this book and am sorry to say that I was very  dissapointed. I would have to be desperate to pick up another by this  author.	1999-06-01

The characters did not reach me at a personal level, and it did not pull at the heart strings. I thought that Skye was a little bit flaky. She fell into bed and in love with both  of her men awfully quick. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with  falling into bed, but she just made it seem a little blase. It was all in  all worth the read, but if you loved this book and have not read Virginia  Henley's Pirate and the Pagan, you must pick it up. It is by far a better  book. In fact, it is one of the best books I have ever had the privilege of  reading and the storyline is very similar with one exception. NO WIGS!	1999-05-24

Don't get me wrong, I loved this book and cannot deny Judith McNaught's ability to kick out a fantastic romance, but I just don't understand why Whitney gave him her unconditional love. I will be the first to admit that  I love my hero's strong, demanding and arrogant, however, he totally  treated her like dirt. He never gave her the opportunity to explain  anything and he never said he was sorry. If you ask me, Clayton should have  been the one to grovel at Whitney's feet instead of the other way around. I  loved the dinner scene!	1999-05-24

While I don't think this book is near as good as the other 3, (and I did like the Dragon and the Jewel) it definitely held my attention. Things were very hot in the  bedroom and he did not cheat on his wife because his mistress was his wife.  Virginia Henley is the incomparable queen of hot, exciting romance!	1999-05-24

I am not a huge fan of Western historicals, I usually read Medievel, but I was so swept up in this book that I want to read all of Ms. Jordans other books. This book was awesome! Not very many books make my heart physically  ache but this one did. I felt so bad for Heather. How could she not love  the hell out of Sloan. What a man. I did think that he was a huge jerk to  her throughout the entire book and I think she should have let him sweat a  little more before she went back to him but I understand why she had a hard  time resisting him. I am very impressed with Nicole's writing. It is fast  paced and she draws you in to a hot (and I mean hot!) luscious story. I  can't wait to read the next one.	1999-03-15

I had purchased it about 6 months ago and it had been sitting on my book shelf until I had this all of a sudden overwhelming urge to read a  bertrice. Let me tell you what....this is one hot, exciting book. I was so  engrossed in it that I did not want it to end. I almost turned right back  to the first page after finishing it. Even though totally different, Zaynab  has become one of my favorite heroines. I bawled while reading this book  and will never forget how I loved it and how I felt while reading it.	1999-01-05

In fact I have never read one of her books that I did not absolutely go nuts over. She has a gift to draw you in so much that you are actually  living in that time period. I loved Connor because like all her men he is  just totally irresistable! I love a powerfully domineering (only in books)  man that loves his woman so much that he will kill for her. Brenna was  adorable of course and you just have to love them! &quot;The Wedding&quot;  is a must read if you read and loved &quot;The Bride&quot;.	1998-12-07

Virginia Henley is one of the few authors that in my oppinion can write a perfect book and Pirate and the Pagan is definitely one of them. Words cannot express how much I loved this book. Simply perfection! I could not  put it down once I picked it up. Ruark and Rory will make your blood turn  to fire and Summer/Cat will enchant you. Virginia, if you are out there,  please write more like Pirate and the Pagan, Raven and the Rose, Falcon and  the Flower and Dragon and the Jewel. They are unsurpassable!	1998-11-30

While I do agree that this book was a little hard to get through, I wouldn't be as harsh as the previous review. I kept thinking  that any minute it would get good but that minute never came. Definitely  not what I have come to expect from Virginia, however, I have read several  awesome books of hers and will continue to look for another in the same  league as Raven and the Rose.	1998-11-27

Tristan did treat Genevieve like dirt, but I don't think it was as bad as what I  read on the other review of this book. First of all, He did not kill her  father and fiance'. They were loyal to different kings and her family died  in the battle for her castle, but it was not Tristan that killed them.  second, He did slap her when he found out she was pregnant, but that was  because she told him that she was gong to get rid of the baby (and no, I  don't condone spousal abuse). Third, He did sort of drag her to the alter,  but he did not bound and gag her, he just held her with his arms and put  his hand over her mouth. I think the book was worth reading, but not in the  same league as &quot;Golden Surrender&quot;.	1998-10-30

Ms. Henley is definately one of my favorite authors if  not my very favorite. Her men are the ULTIMATE and Simon De Montfort is no  exception!

I found myself getting  totally flustered everytime I picked it up. Stephen treated Mary like crap  through the whole entire book. He was still willing himself to hate her  until the very last chapter. She devoted herself to him and he walked on  her like a doormat and used her like a slut. This book was a sequal to  &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, which I found to be 10 times the better book. I  give that one a &quot;10&quot;. All in all, Promise of the Rose was worth  it to read once.	1998-10-12

The story of a viking wounded in a raid and the irish princess  that nurses him back to health. Dag decides to keep Fiona and take her with  him back to his village (against her will). I found this to be very  different from all the other viking stories I have read because Dag cared  for Fiona right from the start and was a very sweet and sensual man. I  found this to be a refreshing change of pace compared to the lusty,  domineering barbarians I usually read about. This book is well worth your  time.	1998-10-12

I was in the mood for a change of pace from my usual historical romance  books and picked this one up in the bookstore the other day. I am so glad I  did! Rolf the hot viking has had a time travel experience from the 10th to  the 20th century. He is the most adorable thing I have ever read on a page.  He falls in love with Merry-Death (meredith), how cute! but tries to find a  way back to his own time to fulfill a promise he made to his father.  Merry-Death fights her very intense feelings for Rolf and finally lets go  of her inhibitions and goes for it. I thought this book was totally  awesome!

It is refreshingly different and totally enchanting!	1998-10-12

Granted, Falcon is full of testosterone and he is  domineering, and even a creep, but I like them that way. I don't want a  sappy, wimpy hero. I like them to take charge and be demanding. It makes  for such a worthwhile romance. What fun is it for them to say &quot;I love  you and fall onto the bed in the first chapter. I like fierce resistance on  the woman's part and &quot;I'm going to take you anyway types on the man's  part. That kind of book makes me squirm and I like it!!!

It was not so much better that any of the other books I have  read, as a matter of fact it is not even on my list of top 10.

The first of a three part series. I read all three and they were all fantastic. This one was my favorite. It just seemed to me that there love was a little bit deeper. I love viking romance and I love Heather Graham aka Shannon Drake.	1998-07-13
