Don't dig into this book expecting something normal. Lispector wasn't a normal writer at all. She wasn't a normal woman. This book was written while her cancer in her uterus was eating her alive, and you can almost taste the angst from the narrator. Not that her other books are any different, but in here it feels even more authentic. Perhaps it's due to the fact that the narrator is ficticious as well. Under the name of Rodrigo S.M., Lispector slashes open her soul and reveals nothing, because that's what it is.<br />Do not read this book waiting for a story. It tells three stories, the first one being about Macabea. The second story is the narrator talking about his writing, and the craft. The third is the narrator talking about his life.<br />Some critics claim that Lispector is \\"existencialism for the masses\\" (as impossible as that may sound) because she avoids complex theories. She refused to read other existentialist authors, because they were too pompous. Lispector admits that there are no answers to her questions, but that absence does not make the questions dissappear. There are a couple of times where her train of thought is hard to follow, but they came very rarely, and the book is definitely worth it. Saying that she was riding on her reputation shows blatant lack of knowledge on her works. Every other book of hers is written in this sinuous manner, and much of the recognition she has in Brazil was attained shortly after her death, since her books never sold well. After reading this, I can't say I don't understand why. It's not a normal book.<br />It's hard to decide which part of this book is sadder, Macabea's pathetic existence or the Narrator's angst. But both are awesome. Just don't expect anything normal, and you'll love it.	2003-05-24

I bought sacrament expecting something grand<BR>I didn't get something grand<BR>I'm not sure if I got anything at all.<br />The book starts very promising. A photographer in the North Pole. Interesting.<BR>Oh he falls into a coma, and flash backs into his childhood. Pretty interesting story.<br />Ok, I'm wrong. It's not really that interesting. It's incredibly clichéd. Maybe Barker thought if the main character was gay, it would make it original. It doesn't. But hey, it's got nice descriptions, and the characters aren't half bad either. I'll keep on going. Now there are some pretty disturbing scenes in here. But I'd expect that from a horror writer.<br />Oh, he wakes up from the coma. Now it goes deeply into his personal and love life, which is totally and completely irrelevant to the main story. But hey, if he's gay, you got to put at least a hundred pages of gratuitous romance and sex scenes that does absolutely nothing in the end, don't you?<br />Now this book keeps building up a huge mystery throughout the first two thirds of the book. That's ok, I actually LIKE that. But what I don't like is when it doesn't really solve anything.<br />In other words, Sacrament is pretty much the most unfulfilling book I've ever read in my entire life. The problems aren't solved, they just seem to fade into the background. The whole super-natural element is totally unexplainable, and when it starts making a little bit of sense it disappears completely.<br />I have nothing against having an established horror author getting in touch with his sentimental side (Hell, I actually prefer Stephen King without the gore), but if this is Barker's nice side, then by God man, HIDE IT!<br />Too much filler(the main character's love life), too much build-up that wraps it up in the most disappointing pages in the history of literature (Domus Mundi and Rukenau do not live up to the hype established in the build-up, not by a long shot).<br />I have Imajica sitting in my shelf, waiting to be read. I honestly hope that will be better than this.	2002-01-18
US	49354645	R2OMVWGJGNY5CJ	0451167538	734693861	Different Seasons (Signet)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Three great stories, one terrible.	The first story (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption) is excellent. The characters are believable, the situations are normal, yet extremely interesting. This could've been a full novel, since when I finished it, I wanted to know more about it. It's a very beautiful story about freedom, and how far a man will go to achieve it.<br />The second story (Apt Pupil) is radically different from the first. This is a dark and disturbing, and (like the first one), very very good. I felt that in the beginning, the story moved way too fast. I would've liked to know about the concentration camps, to know more about how the conversations between the boy and the old man. But in the end, the story slowed down to the perfect pace, and the perfect ending.<br />The third story(The body), although not as disturbing as the second, it's still somewhat dark in my opinion. I've seen the movie countless times, so I can't really judge it. I was bored throughout the story, because I knew all the details. But I think someone who hasn't seen the movie will enjoy this story just as much as the first two, if not more.<br />Like most reviewers here, I disliked the fourth story. There's not enough background info on the characters, not enough build-up before you start caring about the woman in the Breathing Method. But what really ruined it was the ending. The supernatural element was ridiculously gratuitous, totally out of place, and unnecessary. It started off well, but since King didn't expose the 'weird' element until the very end, it seemed rushed and improvised, as if he re-read it and said &quot;not enough blood and aliens&quot;, and decided to add them. *sigh*<br />Oh, and I really liked how the second and the third stories referred to the first one. <br />If the book maintained only the first three stories, then it would definitely earn five stars. But the title would've been seriously compromised.	2002-01-03

After reading Double Whammy, there was something about Hiaasen's style that addicted me to every word in the book. Sure, the story was only average, but the way he writes it makes it special. I wondered what he could do with a better story than Double Whammy had.<br />I wonder no more. The story here is great, the characters are unusual, the situations are unusual, and the setting is unusual (you don't see many books talking about strip clubs). The story is somewhat clichéd (good mother after her daughter, that was unjustly taken away by the bad father), but Hiaasen's talent makes you forget that.<br />I actually picked up this book without knowing anything about the Demi Moore movie. Of course, I knew of it's existence (how could you not know about it? With all the hype surrounding it), but I didn't know it was based on this novel. I can't make comparisons, but I seriously doubt Hiaasen's words could translate well into film.<br />Great book. Definitely addictive. Highly recommended!	2001-11-30

Let's just get that straight before I talk about the flaws.<br />First, I must say that the first one hundred pages were terribly boring. I mean, all this race to find this byzanium material, and we only find out WHY THE HECK IT'S SO IMPORTANT way too late. I found myself yawning as I read those pages, and it only got intersting when the Titanic kicked in (then again, way too late)<br />Another thing is the remarkable lack of accuracy. I'm not much of a realistic nut, but if you are, stay away from this novel. First of all, the Titanic split in two before sinking, but it's complete in this novel, making the entire plot downright impossible. But this isn't my biggest gripe (I managed to ignore the lack of realism) but the worst thing is the portrayal of the soviet soldiers.<br />The russians aren't simply demonized in this work. Clive Cussler goes out of his way just to bash them. They seem to constantly praise the americans when they talk between themselves &quot;The americans have an annoying habit of accomplishing what they set out to do&quot; (actual quote from the book). I mean, come on! Also, they are constantly outsmarted, as if they are just stupid monkeys with AK-47s. They are also heartless, I might add, not hesitating to do hte most horrible things (even though they always fail).<br />Although I can question the plot, I can't question Cussler's ability to describe a scene. He does it masterfully. Many of the scenes the pages just seemed to zoom as the suspense filled the plot. The rising of the Titanic seems to be the one that sticks out in my mind the most.<br />I liked this book. Really. But the thing is, it's got way too many big flaws for me to give it five stars, or even four stars.	2001-11-22
US	49354645	R1SBN17YGN3EE4	0786808012	442293804	Artemis Fowl	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Perfection? No. But pretty close.	I believe there are two kinds of people in this world. The ones that root for the good guys, and the ones that root for the bad guys. Kids aren't safe from this classification. There's always the kid in the back of the theatre wishing Bambi would just drop dead. Come on, admit it. You cheered for Darth Vader in Star Wars. Who didn't? Eoin Colfer (what an original name!) made a book for every child in every last row in every class of the entire world. That book is Artemis Fowl.<br />Artemis Fowl is a story about a boy who is an amazing genius. He kidnaps Holly Short so he'll get money from the fairy people, who have been forced to live underground years ago, since the human population has grown beyond control.<br />Artemis Fowl's biggest strength is the characters. Three-dimensional people (or centaurs or dwarves or fairies... you get my point) with flaws and qualities that makes them look real. Artemis isn't completely evil. But he's not ocmpletely good either. The same can be said about every character in the book. They are REAL, yet still simple enough so that any child will understand it.<br />The technology the fairies use is fantastic, and it is perfectly described. He doesn't go too far, leaving only enough details so the reader's imagination will have something to work with. Some great gadgets and magic.<br />The only flaw I can come up with is that the book seems too short. With the millions of things that could've happened in the book's plot, Colfer seems to have chosen far too few. It gives the reader the impression that this book is only a prelude of things that REALLY matter, that will happen in the sequels.<br />I sure hope the sequels come soon. I can't wait!	2001-11-19

Some parts will have you sweating with suspense (The scenes with Hopley, with Leda, etc...) while others you'd wish you were reading another book (what's with the gypsy chase? That was dangerously boring). The characters were pretty average (I guess it's King's formula. Good people, evil situations) but still human. But the ending, oh boy.<br />I've read all over the internet, people keep complaining about the ending. Mainly because it's not the Hollywood ending, everyone hugs and walks towards the sunset. It really seems that King came up with an excelent idea for an ENDING, not a story. And he developed it into a nicely sized novel. And he managed to make it very interesting. The whole gypsy scenario, curses and everything isn't really the focus. It's just one of the million ways King could've used to get to the real message. And trust me, the message isn't &quot;watch your diet&quot;.<br />Oh, that is definately NOT the real message.<br />Buy this book. Enjoy the good parts, bear through the boring parts, and watch in awe as the ending unfolds.	2001-11-17
US	49354645	RJ19LURPGWGIX	0345338588	474733359	On a Pale Horse (Incarnations of Immortality, Bk. 1)	Books	3	11	15	N	N	I guess I expected too much...	I must say, very few books at amazon.com receive a 4.8 overall rating. Specially one with over 50 reviews. So I bought 'On a Pale Horse' expecting something grand. I got an OK fantasy book that's not really as creative as it sounds and dangerously trite towards the middle.<br />The book is extremely interesting in the beginning and at the end (specially the meeting with the Father of Lies himself) but Luna, one of the most two-dimensional characters I've ever read in a book (Even for FANTASY books) almost ruins it. Zane has a formulaic passion over this girl, and I found the interaction between them by far the worst part of the book.<br />While some of the most exciting scenes really got me up and pumping, like the few battle scenes,  the quality was quickly slumped by the love story, in which Piers Anthony persisted on making it show up every 20 pages or so.<br />Piers seems to continuously belittle DEATH throughout the book. The main character is constantly manipulated by the other incarnations, it seems that nothing's new because they already know what's going to happen. If only Zane developed a more rebellious attitude at being so obviously controlled, the character would be even better than it is already (It only loses to the Lord of Evil himself, whose arguments would make a $2000-an-hour lawyer's arguments seem like a monkey gibberish)<br />Does this book deserve only 3 stars? No, 3.5 would be more accurate. But it's closer to 3 than it is to 4. Great concept, but the two-dimensional romance was definately the focus here in the book, and it is definately (at least, in my opinion) the weakest part of the book.<br />Even after it's flaws, this book is still a worthy addition to an avid reader's library.	2001-11-08

This is not for your children. The main characters go on for a fight against the Church, and even further at the end, so if you think any kind of media might loosen your iron-fist grip over your child's thoughts and ideas, DO NOT BY THIS BOOK.<br />Ok, it was nice to get that outta my chest. I read the Golden Compass under a friend's recommendation. It was an excellent book, the ending was fantastic, near the last 60 pages, adrenaline was pumping into my veins so much I had to go out for a run after I finished the book. But trust me when I say this. The Subtle Knife is better than Golden Compass. MUCH MUCH better. The book starts to get too-addictive-to-be-considered-legal halfway through, when Will gets the Subtle Knife.<br />Lyra and her Golden Compass (*I'm too lazy to spell it's real name*) take a step back in this book, and the new character, Will, unlikable at first, becomes the main character near the middle of the book. It would seem like a sexist move by Pullman. Maybe it was, I don't know, but it didn't seem to have any implicit message to it. Lyra is still a very important character in this sequel.<br />The plot in the first book pales in comparison to the one present here. It makes Golden compass look like a 300 page long delay for the real plot that starts here. (Don't get me wrong, I still love Golden Compass with a mad passion)<br />If you liked the Golden compass, buy this book. If you were ever close to being entertained in one slight moment at the previous book, you will love the Subtle Knife. Put this book on the Number 1 spot of your Wish list. Buy it as soon as you can.	2001-11-02

Well, after reading it all in a day, I can say that in that way I was disappointed. I did not laugh as much as I did in a, shall we say, a Terry Pratchett novel. But I did chuckle at some of the moments (specially at the end. The people at the gym must think I'm insane)<br />The thing is, it's that it seems that Hiaasen decided to divide the book in two. The serious parts and the funny parts. The serious parts are great, and the funny parts are great as well, but when he tries to mix both of them, the quality drops. If he decided to do the important parts in a serious way, then he should've dropped the entirelly serious parts altogether, because I ended up not caring about the scenes that are funny-serious. And sometimes they WERE important for the plot (which is surprisingly good, for a fishing thriller :)<br />You should definitely buy this book. The plot is a lot better than I thought, but it's not as funny as I thought it would be(with the surprising number of positive reviews and all)... A fair exchange in my opinion.	2001-10-27

I love Hitchcock, but this book is terrible. Most of the stories here are terrible. This is the first book that I have started reading and haven't finished. And quite honestly, I don't plan to. Most of the main premises are either horrible clichés, filled with stereotypes or it's not developed correctly.<br />The only story that I loved (which saved this book from getting only one star) was &quot;The Artist&quot;. My Blood DID run cold, and I WAS shocked. But from what I've read, the other stories aren't on the same level of quality.<br />What's so scary about a guy that sells different yellow convertibles every day to Mexico? Oh no!

I cannot say it is the best book ever written, for I have not read every book. But I say that if I had, Aztec would probably be the one I'd remember most dearly.<br />In other words, you're not a book-lover if you haven't read Aztec. It will shock you, it will make you laugh, it will take you close to tears. It's the most complete literary work I've ever come across and it will probably keep this title for a long time.<br />The main character is incredibly human, even more human than some people I know. I cringe when I call him a character, because after reading this book, he feels more like a friend. He makes mistakes, not stupid mistakes, but mistakes we would make if we were in his position. The people that he shares his life with are also noteworthy. Even Hernan Cortes isn't demonized here. The Spanish are noted as real people. As people with flaws, which are criticised with heavy doses of irony and sarcasm.<br />I love reading books, but the biggest book I've read before Aztec was only 450 pages long. This is 1039. If you want to start reading long books (it's a step bigger than I imagined) than Aztec would be the perfect kind. The book is huge not because it has overly-long-descriptions. It's long because it's a person's life, and a very long and busy life I might add.<br />I plan on finding a hardcover edition of this book. Just so I can keep it on my shelf, unread and in perfect condition. This is better entertainment than any other kind of media can give.<br />Buy this book. Read it. Love it. Share it.	2001-10-21

I mean, Isaac Asimov is a famous writer, if not THE famous SF writer. But after finishing this short book (around 230 pages) I believe he's overrated. At least, if all his books are as &quot;not-awesome&quot; as this one.<br />The main premise is good. 62-year-old male starts walking and with one step he goes a hundred thousand years in the future. All righty then...<br />The fallout Earth isn't described vividly enough. I often had to come up with details myself so I could picture it as vividly as I'm used to do with other books.<br />The characters varied from painfully artificial to amazingly natural. The main character is very human, and reacts as surprised as anyone would be jumping to the future, but he comes to that conclusion far slower than the average person would.<br />Also, I'm afraid a sad ending or even a not-so-happy ending would fit the story better than it's current &quot;everyone-hugs-with-a-rainbow-on-the-sky-straight-outta-hollywood&quot; ending.<br />But the conspiracy theories the villains create are surprisingly elaborate and very well thought-out...<br />On the whole, I'd still recommend this book, but don't expect the 4.5 out of 5 book that everyone's raving about here...	2001-10-20

Because this book is so bare, so naked, so &quot;should've-been-longer&quot; that I'm surprised that it got so famous.<br />I won't go into plot details because it's been gone over and over in all the other reviews. The book is divided in three parts. The shower room and it's consequences, before the prom and after the prom.<br />The book starts at a breakneck speed with the shower room scene and slows down to a screeching halt afterwards. The pace only picks up when Carrie and her mother are on scene.<br />King wrote this book in a very interesting manner. He put up fictional newspaper and book articles on the story. Without them the book would be even shorter.<br />IT seemed to me that King should've elaborated more on Carrie's past. The other pranks the kids put on her.<br />Without the prom scene (Which is described to perfection) this book would've been a two star book at best. It literally saves this book.	2001-10-20

The characters are great (although some of them are really obscure and weird) the story is amazingly original. I gotta hand it to Pullman, I would've never come up with such an original story.<br />The setting kinda reminds me of a early 1900's steampunkish world, but it's so different from ours, it would be hard to classify it correctly.<br />Undoubtably one of the best books I've ever read, if not THE best.

I recently acquired this anthology in Portuguese, and I must say it's a nice, short book, with some pretty cool stories. There are 14 different stories, with no connections between them, except that they share one quality: murder. Except for one story, the main character always:<br />a) kills<BR>b) gets killed<BR>c) sees somebody get killed<br />The quality from one story to another varies wildly, although I must say all of them are worth reading. My favorite one is &quot;Millionaire for five minutes.&quot;<br />Talking about an anthology is complicated, because new characters show up only to be discarded in 20 pages, when another story starts. Their personalities and actions vary, as one would expect, from evil to naive and so on. But they're all believable, something rare in most mystery stories.<br />If you happen to find this book somewhere, or if it get's reissued, I'd say you should definately buy it if you're into mysteries	2001-09-10

Because, simply put, it would still be worth reading if you removed the jokes. Sadly, I can't say the same about Sourcery.<br />Is Sourcery still a great book worth reading? Yes.<BR>Are there more &quot;laughs&quot; than in the previous 4 Discworld novels? Yes.<BR>Is the main premise (the backbone of the story) interesting? Yes.<br />However, the characters, although solid, aren't as good as in Mort, or Wyrd Sisters. The only memorable enough (as in &quot;I gotta tell my friends about him&quot;) is the librarian. Other characters who would otherwise seem amazing either aren't developed enough (Conina, Nijel) or are developed wrongly (the sourcerer himself) And Rincewind seems to be losing his &quot;loser&quot; appeal.<br />As you can plainly see, I enjoy talking about flaws. The book's still a great addition to the discworld series (much, much better than Equal Rites) and any Terry Pratchett fan owes himself (or herself, in some rare cases) the purchase of this book.	2001-09-10

Equal Rites, for lack of better definition, [wasn't good]. I saw great potential in the characters, but I remember laughing only once or twice throughout the whole book. Thank God Pratchett lived up to the character's potentials this time.<br />The back cover of the book says the main plot is about royal trouble, while it really is a parody of theatrical plays. Some of the scenes are laugh-out-loud funny.<br />The book is pretty slow in the beggining, but it speeds up gradually. If you ever chuckled at one of the previous discworld novels, you will love this one. Yes, the improvement is that huge.	2001-09-07

In this book, the characters wander aimlessly through the world, without much MAJOR objective in mind.<br />Is it worth your time and money? Yes. But don't think the entire series stays like this (it improves a lot!)<br />After reading this book, I wasn't really encouraged to buy it's sequels. If I hadn't read on the internet that it gets a LOT better, I would've never had. Thank God for the internet	2001-07-25

Having read the other 3 previous novels, I can say that this is rivals the Light Fantastic in terms of quality and characters. Some of the scenes weren't described so well(ie. I only discovered Mort's age a little bit too late in my opinion) and it's too short, doesn't cover ALL of the things that could've happened with the idea (Which I won't spoil it for you)<br />But other than that, a great Discworld novel, much better than Equal Rites (Which I was disapointed with)	2001-07-22

The thing is, I picked up this book after throughoutfully enjoying Gerritsen's medical thrillers (I figured they'd feature the same gripping story-telling) but what I found was a lukewarm novel, filled with two-dimensional characters and a terribly boring plot. The ending was nice, but it wasn't enough to save this book.<br />So... If you read Gerritsen's medical thrillers (Bloodstream, Harvest, etc...) don't expect the same kind of plot, characters or narration in here.	2001-07-16

I had just finished reading The light Fantastic, and that book managed to keep a smile at my face with every page. Not so with this book. Although the basic premise is great, this book is a lot slower than the first two novels. Yes, the characters are still great, and some of the jokes WILL make you laugh. I just hoped they would come up just as often as the first two books.<br />Do I recommend this book? Yes. The characters and the jokes are still good enough to warrant both your money and your time (then again, 213 pages isn't much)	2001-07-16

When I got this book, I was expecting an average &quot;use this in your campaign and shut up&quot; resource book. But what I got was an extremely flexible campaign saver. Are your villains more stupid than evil? Are the suspense parts not really suspense, but boredom? Use these great examples in this book. They can be adjusted perfectly for your camapaign and setting (some seamlessly, some... eh... not quite) Every villain has an &quot;alternate-setting&quot; version, and a couple of adventures that could spawn off him. This book includes everything, since the &quot;low-key&quot; thug that appears in every adventure to &quot;evil syndicates&quot; that span all over the globe. Very handy.<br />The illustrations in this book are one of the greatest in any RPG book you'll ever find. There are many variations, and it has to be seen to be believed. Every chapter has it's own mini-covers with various photographs in it. They really add to the theme of the book. Great job. I look forward to seeing this style in more Gurps books.<br />However, the only flaw I could find here is that there aren't enough tips on how to make your OWN villain. Sure, there are two pages or so every chapter, but quite honestly, that's not enough. And there are some worlds that aren't covered either by the &quot;alternate-setting&quot; section or the main settings. Sure, some of the more &quot;obscure&quot; settings are covered (Bunnies and burrows, etc...) but many rather interesting books aren't (Russia, Aztecs, etc...)<br />So all that I want to say is that if there is one thing would radically improve this book, is increasing it's size, putting more villains and more details into making your very own.<br />Highly reccomended. If you like rpgs, or you're the kind that always roots for the bad guys, get this book. It's definately worth it.	2001-06-29

Most of the pictures here are very unique, like a moment frozen in time (believe me, most pictures aren't) and every one of them is cool in their own way. Most of the text is also very interesting (Unlike the &quot;The blue day book&quot; were most of the comments were too simple and too superficial) You definately have to get this book. It's worth both your time and money.	2001-06-27

At first I was really dissapointed, however, soon after I discovered that this is more like a script of all his work, I enjoyed the book. Most of the jokes in here have been used on his stand-up shows. So if you're a huge &quot;I've seen all his work&quot; Chris Rock fan, than probably you won't find anything new here. If you just watched him on TV for the first time or you saw the hype all over the media, and you'd like to see more, then by all means, buy this book. I did, and I laughed my butt off.<br />His comedy makes fun of everything. Every kind of stereotype imaginable is insulted here. So if you don't dig this kind of stuff, then don't even go pass the first page.	2001-06-27

The catch phrase for this book sounded great. &quot;Can the world's deadliest virus... save mankind?&quot; Yes, I'm a sad person for falling into such a simple marketing trick. But I'm glad I did. Although clichéd (Specially the beggining in the middle of the jungle... I'm brazillian, so I was kind of insulted those stereotypes.), This story is very well written, and the characters are strong. The plague scenes are described to the utmost detail, so this is not a book for people that dislike this sort of &quot;gross&quot; scenes.<br />So what's this HUGE threat that this virus is supposed to save? Well, I won't spoil it for you (You'll find out by the 70th page or so) but it's not as intriguing as you might think. As I said in the title of this review, the action isn't very consistent, sometimes the story slows down to a turtle pace, and the action speeds up in less then a page. It's very unpredictable and that's both good and bad.<br />Overall, If you dig medical thrillers, or disease-related-novels (The Hot zone, for an example) in general, you should pick this up. It's definately worth your time and money.	2001-06-27

This book would've been suitable for all ages if it wasn't for a certain picture that includes a pig and a sheep... eh... doing it.

Now Pratchett pulls everything together in &quot;The light Fantastic&quot;. The locations where Rincewind and Twoflower pass are much more interesting, much funnier. The characters they meet are way more quirky. I would go really far to say that the #1 reason you should read the first one, is that you'll understand this sequel.	2001-06-26

No, much, much better.	&quot;Best Medical thriller since Coma.&quot; - Lots of reviewers (just because it involves the same &quot;black market organ selling&quot; idea)<br />Make no mistake. Harvest is one of the greatest books I've ever read. However, the Coma comparisons have gone too far. It's far superior to Coma. The characters are more believable, for one. The ammount of action and suspense is amazing, and most of it happens outside the surgery room (No more 200 page descriptions on how the surgeon cut his stomach half an inch too deep) so this is more accessible to the average joe (The average joe that reads 350-pages-long novels, that is.)<br />So in other words, Harvest puts emphasis on the &quot;Thriller&quot; in Medical thriller, instead of the opposite.	2001-06-24

Some people really love this book, and some people really hate this book. However, the main reason that this happened is that this isn't your average medical thriller. It has some pretty violet scenes(teenager chewed off his thumb to get out of the handcuffs, later found dead) and other scenes not often found in medical thrillers. Most of the action here takes place OUTSIDE of a hospital. It doesn't deal with the corruption in the medical system. It doesn't deal with any of the clichés found in other medical thrillers. It deals with the clichés found in other horror-thriller books. Some people have been complaining that there is a certain lack of detail in the descriptions, that seem somewhat vague. Since I've read this book just after it's release in Mass Market Paperback, I cannot honestly say if that's true or not. One thing I can say is that the medical scenes ARE well described. The characters are very well written (truly three-dimensional characters, with flaws like real people)<br />If you're not sure wether to buy this book or not, read the first 6 pages of the book(somewhere, I don't know) and see if you can resist the temptation of reading the rest. I really loved this book, but I can't say that you will too, specially after seeing the reviews differing each other so much.	2001-06-24
US	49354645	R1B1NI4CDPWNC	0671016768	401600096	Bloodstream	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Different from your average medical thriller	Gerritsen has an amazing eye for detail and gripping dialogue. The situations in this book are very peculiar. The plot mainly consists of teenagers going violent all of a sudden. It may seem cliche, but trust me, no book has ever amazed me so much. Could be the characters, so realistic. Could be the scenes, so vividly described. But I think it is mostly how everything comes together in this great novel. Read the first six pages. And I dare you to stop reading this book.<br />It's just that good.	2001-06-24

After reading Gerritsen's amazing medical thrillers, I decided to go for her earlier books. All I can say is... *Yawn* Although many people might find this story interesting and romantic, I find it awfully cliched, and the characters are too two-dimensional.<br />If you just read one of her medical thrillers and you're expecting the same fast-paced page-turning experience here, look elsewhere.	2001-06-24
