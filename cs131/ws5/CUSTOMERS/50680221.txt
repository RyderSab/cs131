US	50680221	R2L5BWJE7PUNLV	0060937319	350275263	A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present	Books	5	131	169	N	N	A note on revisionist history	Howard Zinn's A PEOPLE'S HISTORY is probably the most famous example of revisionist history. What is revisionist history?  Well, most importantly, it is an attempt to show important historical events from the perspective of those who have not typically written history, for example women, African-Americans, poor and working-class people, gays and lesbians, among others.<br />Take, for example, Zinn's very brief analysis at the end of the book about the Clinton years. The popular press portrayed, consistently and repeatedly, the 90s as a decade of prosperity and a booming stock exchange, with poverty nowhere in sight. The 90s dawned as communism, it's enemy, collapsed.  The 90s was the alleged triumph of capitalism. But Zinn looks critically at just who \\"triumphed\\" and what kind of \\"triumph\\" it was.  He gives us different \\"dispatches\\" from the 90s, voices not likely to be heard in The Wall Street Journal: workers displaced from good-wage blue-collar jobs as those jobs moved overseas thanks to free-trade agreements; welfare mothers supporting families on minimum wages because the public believes they had to \\"work for their check\\" while the defense budget soars; the degradation of public schools and services; chronic poverty among African-Americans. <br />What this revisionist history of the 90s does is two-fold: 1) it creates an alternative narrative of the 90s, as a decade in which the social safety net was sacrificed to fill the coffers of the highest 1%, and 2) in creating this coutnernarrative, Zinn revealed how \\"constructed\\" this official history is, that is, that any history that claims the 90s as the \\"triumph of capitalism\\" is able do so only by ignoring and suppressing those other dispatches from the 90s.<br />So the claim that Zinn is biased is, therefore, irrelevant.  History, as Zinn himself claims, is constructed from an endless supply of evidence and events.  The historian operates on assumptions (that is, ideology), to create history.  Zinn is quite upfront that he is \\"anti-capitalist\\" and frankly, I think he bleakly illuminates the endless pain capitalism has wreaked on the majority of the population while a tiny minority lives off the fat.  To point out Zinn's bias is merely to help him make his point. The reality is that the left is aware of its ideology; the right pretends its ideology and history is merely \\"natural.\\"	2003-03-26
US	50680221	R3Q0TUR1QIGYJ8	0066209773	650878863	The Master Butchers Singing Club: A Novel (Erdrich, Louise)	Books	3	9	20	N	N	Unfocused story	This novel started out following Fidelis, a German man, whose best friend served with him and died in World War Two: Fidelis returns home, bathes for the first time in years (finally cleansed and shell-shocked, even the sun hurts him), marries his friend's pregnant fiance, and travels to America with his luggage full of sausage.  His plan is to sell the sausage to pay his ticket-fare to Seattle, where he hopes to settle.  This 25-page section is evocative, full of imagery and empathy for the character, witty, and imaginative.<br />Then Fidelis, as a character, nearly disappears for the rest of the book.<br />The novel instead turns its focus on Delphine, a woman whose father is a drunk and who never knew her mother.  Delphine is travelling as part of an acrobatics act with her partner, a part-Obijwe, who also served in WWII.  He is also, as we learn later, a homosexual.  The scenes which focus on the gay acrobat are evocative, full of insight and empathy for his repressed longing, and alive with emotion.<br />Delphine returns home with the acrobat and moves in with her drunk father Roy, who -- for gratuitious narrative reasons -- has a cellar full of dead people.  Delphine goes to work for Fidelis and meets his wife, Eva, who eventually  is stricken with cancer.  In a glorious scene, a dying Eva rides in an airplane with her son (against the wishes of her husband) and feels an intense joy for being able to \\"fly\\" but also an intensified pain, from the cancer.  This scene, which shows how the spirt can never separate itself from the body, is evocative, painfully realistic, sad, and full of empathy.<br />Eventually, Eva dies and Delphine, out of concern for the boys, begins to mother them.  One of the boys digs a hole in the ground, and, surrounded by earth, for the first time feels both at rest and able to fully feel the pain of his mother's (Eva's) death.  This scene, which merges the human (emotions) with the natural (the earth,) is gloriously resonant.<br />Eventually, 2 of Fidelis's boys are taken back to Germany, the acrobat leaves, and Delphine's father, Roy, falls off the wagon again.  Delphine marries Fidelis and takes care of her dying father.  Just before he dies, Roy tells Delphine who her mother is: she was an Indian woman who survived a massacre.<br />The end of the novel, for the firs time since the opening, narrates events NOT from Delphine's perspective.  This closing scene takes place in the past: in it, we learn that Roy is not Delphine's father; instead, a homeless hobo woman rescued an abandoned baby and brought it to Roy to raise.  The homeless woman was the Indian of Roy's story, the woman he was in love with his whole life.  This scene left me floored.<br />Noticing a pattern?  Whenever the narrative focuses on Delphine, the writing is competent, character development is adequate, and plotting is unoriginal.  When Erdrich focuses on one of her minor characters, the story comes alive, resonant with heartache, pain, hope, and love.  Why in God's name she chose to focus the bulk of the narrative on dull-as-toast Delphine is beyond me.	2003-02-28

And that's enough to kill a book.  And it kills this one.  I second the person who said ideas and characters were lifted from Delillo's WHITE NOISE, particularly the way the young children gang up and verbally attack their parents.<br />The dialogue is uninspired; the description is unimaginative.  Franzen moves through time in a very plodding way.<br />Again, I have to second another reviewer: if you want to read a great book on families, read THE MAN WHO LOVED CHILDREN by Christina Stead.	2002-10-28
US	50680221	R8ZMHPF5VJBKW	0385720955	850910906	The Blind Assassin: A Novel	Books	2	7	9	N	N	Not Peggy's best	Atwood is one of my favorite writers.  Her novels THE HANDMAID'S TALE and ALIAS GRACE are two of my favorite books of the past 15 years.  She has also written some extremely interesting short stories.  Atwood's best writing is hilarous and disturbing at the same time, with a strong narrative thread.  This book was neither.  The storyline -- a wealthy young woman forced to marry a wealthy man because her own family's money is rapidly dissapearing -- was extremely familiar.  I believe the movie TITANIC had the same premise.  No interesting psychology.  Dreadful, flat, present-tense prose which is called &quot;lyrical&quot; because it piles up phrases and clauses to create a certain lilting rhythm.  For some reason, Atwood decides to open nearly every chapter with an uninspired description of the season; this throat clearing then segues into a very tedious rendition of old age by the narrator.  Again, no new insights into this woman's life.  All in all, Iris was an extremely flat character and her sister, whom she puffed up with a lot of hot air and wind, never materialized as anything.  Too bad this was the novel that brought Peggy her Booker.	2002-01-02
US	50680221	RTBU87IXBHA5H	0375411097	619418538	Getting a Life: Stories	Books	2	10	17	N	N	Not quite bowled over	What's the fuss over this collection?  It has been reviewed, positively, in every magazine and newspaper I read; it has a great cover; and the subject matter sounded interesting, so I bought it.  But my impressions of the first story were not that good and they haven't changed with each new story I read.  The first story has a very cynical teenager walking around town, thinking how she'll never be an at-home, fat, stifled, bored mother; then, she stumbles upon one such specimen and her child, who has a lentil up his nose.  The teenager goes into the house with the mother and child.  THe mother acts slightly hysterical.  The girl makes some callous, mean observations about the woman and then leaves.  End of story.  What in god's name am I to make of this?  Was this a satire?  And if so, of whom?  The mother or the girl?  They both were shallow.  I had no sympathy for the mother, nor for the girl.  Ms. Simpson filters everything through the girl's mind and takes no position on the material herself.  All of the stories are like this: some woman who doesn't have time for herself because she has too many children is described in somewhat unflattering light and then has to interact with a callous, mean-spirited individual (usually her husband) and then the story ends.  No conflict, really; no significant movement in the stories.  No plot.  Dialogue alone is used to carry large sections of the narrative, but the dialogue has no real shading or heft; it doesn't reveal anything about the characters.  It's hard to tell what is being satirized here.  Frankly, the writing seemed anthropological.  LOTS of describing what a mother/wife does in the course of a day but no real penetrating observations or insights.  The writing is slack.  Nothing I'd write home about.	2001-08-09

Again and again, Bush told the American people and the press that he deserved to be president bacause he had worked hardest at campaigning; not that he had a message or ideas that were relevant for the historic moment that we're in. In fact, nothing Bush says has anything to do with critical thinking. He says his greatest philosophical influence was Jesus and then can only cobble together some sort of Sunday-service style interpretation of Jesus.  Miller cites countless instances where Bush basically repeats &quot;I'm putting forward a message,&quot; without following up with a message or anything insightful.  And the critique of Cokie Roberts and Sam Donaldson was devastating.	2001-07-31

I'm a low-wage earner myself.  Granted, I work in an office, which is probably a better environment than any of those in which Ehrenreich worked.  I could barely find this book in Borders.  Borders has about eight tables inside the entrance where it displays its new books, but this one wasn't one of them.  I was surprised, particularly as I perused the tables and found the usual filler that the publishing industry is endlessly promoting. The Times had a real favorable review. Finally, I found a lone copy tucked back in the sociology section.<br />Ehrenreich writes about something dear to my heart.  Every day, in the newspapers and on t.v., I hear about what a great economy this is -- jobs everywhere.  It's a great time to be a worker.  Yadda, yadda. So I get my first job, after months of searching, at 7.24 an hour.  Not bad, I think.  Well above minimum wage.  Well, as Ehrenreich points out, there's NO PLACE TO LIVE in Portland that doesn't cost 750 dollars a month.  I rent a freaking room, unheated, for 300 a month and commute a half hour to work.  Fortunately, I can make ends meet, but only because of two things: 1) I don't have kids and 2) my parents help me out of a tight spots.  Many of the people Ehrenreich writes about don't have this luxury.<br />The book was terrific.  I can't think of another word.  She has amazing powers of observation.  I laughed out loud probably 50 times.  There's also a lot of poignant moments, such as when Tammy sprains her ankle but doesn't stop working and every time Ehrenreich &quot;comes out&quot; to her colleagues.  I found those moments interesting.  Personally, I'd be upset if I worked in the trenches with someone who later tells me that she did it for a book.<br />My only quibble with Ehrenreich is at the very end of the book, when she talks about the working-poor in relation to the more affluent, powerful part of society.  Ehrenreich thinksthat someday the working-poor will revolt and then painful change will come about.  I think she underestimates this upheavel.  If the affluent no longer hate welfare mothers who don't work, that doesn't mean that hate has disappered.  Frankly, I think that hate has been transferred to the working poor.  And I don't think that the affluent among us are going to politely succumb to the working-poor unionizing and demanding fair treatment; they're too vested in our slave-labor. The 90s has already made affluent people feel entitled to this service, and they're not going to give it up without a fight.	2001-05-30
US	50680221	R179LTZTUHQ0VL	0262112396	260635459	Bachelors (October Books)	Books	3	36	44	N	N	Fairly unconvinced	I haven't read all of the essays in this book.  I might not want to.  I think I've read five of the eight and parts of two others.  Overall, I have not been particularly impressed.  My introduction to Krauss came in an essay she authored on James Coleman, which I read for a class in college.  It was particularly sophisticated: employing ideas from Barthes and Benjamin, she touched on ideas about obsolesence and signifiers that fail to signify, and in doing so brought a fresh perspective to an artist I never understood.  In short, Krauss took difficult art and made sense of it.  Unfortunately, in this book, Krauss takes on the foundation of the feminist canon but refuses to do feminist readings of their work.  In fact, she attempts to perform an overhaul not just of critical appreciation of Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine, Claude Cahun, etc., but attempts to dismantle feminist theory altogether.  In the very weak essay on Cindy Sherman, Krauss overlooks obvious feminist elements of Sherman's imagery (how they mimic the form of the pornographic centerfold, for example) with some talk about the &quot;fetishization of the vertical&quot; and the &quot;sublimation of the subject into the horizontal.&quot;  Worse, she tries to undo Laura Mulvey's seminal essay on film theory by pointing out a few assumption's Mulvey makes. Krauss never fesses up to her own assumptions. It's not persuasive art criticism.<br />Basically, Krauss's method is always to locate in the art some formal element which can then be tied to a critical theoretical term.  Thus, the horizontal is a rejection of &quot;the fetishization of the vertical&quot;; Sherrie Levine putting single objects in glass cases is an enactment of Deleuze's &quot;machine&quot;.  Krauss reveals how artists thematize critical theory rather than perform critical readings of the work. Thus, important artists for her are those who anticipate theoretical developments.  Frankly, I think Krauss is attributing meaning to formal elementswhich do not inhere to the element itself.  And how many times can an art critic point to multiplicity and a destabilizing of identity as &quot;avante-garde&quot; and subversive?	2001-04-13

Everything about this book screamed &quot;NON-WESTERN!&quot;  The rhymes and puns and capitalized words that &quot;interrupt&quot; the narrative, a non-linear plot, and symoblism that symbolizes other symbols(!)  For a few paragraphs, this was refreshing.  But Roy's narrative technique -- taking a simple story, stuffing it in a cuisinart, and letting the resultant globs of narrative fall where they may -- seems to preclude a critical perspective on Indian history and Western cultural influence.  Instead, the reader gets vertigo and is confused as to where to go and what to do -- the exact byproduct of a postmodern, multi-national capitalist world that she supposedly is criticizing.	2000-12-06

Every time I'm on Amazon I look up intelligent, literate books and NO ONE has written about them.  Can't people read books other than those that win the literary prizes.<br />Anyhow...this is an excellent collection by Beattie. It was her second collection after DISTORTIONS.  Although several stories use the present tense and portray emotionally dead people, none of them are the minimalist, four-paragraph type story that crop up in her next collection, THE BURNING HOUSE. All the Beattie trademarks are here: excellent dialogue, sparse but evocative detail, and surprising humor in unlikely spots.  I've recently begun to reread this collection in hopes of writing an essay on Beattie's fiction, and I've discovered how finely crafted and structured these stories are. Clearly, she's more than a distinctive prose style.  I look forward to PERFECT RECALL, coming out in early 2001.	2000-11-27

Is this the latest attempt to break the bounds of &quot;realism&quot;?  (Another example is ALIAS GRACE by Margaret Atwood, which resembles the form of this novel closely.) POSSESSION is at its best when it sticks to the genre conventions; it builds palpable tension with some hilariously delineated characters.<br />Byatt questions what we mean when we talk of an author's &quot;voice,&quot; and the oscillation from one form of text to another creates a nice energy, although I'm tiring of this narrative at this point and hope the new millenium brings some other perspectives.  I recommend this book strongly, although skip ahead whenever Byatt feels the need to talk about psychoanalytic sexuality.	2000-11-15

Maya has taken a narrow slice of her life and seems to have described events and states of mind at random, without regard for coherence or continuity.  She starts out with a gossipy bit on Billie Holiday, then jumps to her first experience of a writing group, and is all over the map from there on.  The worst thing of all is her lack of a critical perspective on her life.  These events happened over thirty years ago but Maya has made no attempt to place them in a larger context, analyze what she felt at the time as compared to what she feels now; in short, she has a disregard for history.  These are really rambling vignettes, and her views on literature and race are embarassingly naive, even for the times.  Her opinion of the literary value of the Genet play fluctuates according to whether she's had a good or bad encounter with a white person!  Unbelievable.  She also makes gross generalizations about African men, black American men, teachers, sons and lovers, and everyone under the sun.  These type of generalizations are what you'd expect to find in a diary, not a piece of published writing.  Does she have an editor?  Does she think that her off-the-cuff opinions are really worth anyone's time?  I only was able to keep reading because I was laughing so hard.  Good for a laugh, unless you're a struggling writer.  You'll be kicking the walls, trying to understand how this got published and your work doesn't.	2000-10-13

McCullers has an incredibly unpretentious way of writing that never preens or demands attention, but the cumulative effect of this book is amazing.  It is definitely a &quot;Southern&quot; book, and I read it before ever reading Faulkner, Capote, or O'Connor, so its blend of the grotesque and tragic had a tremendous effect on me.  This effect might be lost on readers who are already steeped in the Southern style. A lot about the characters is suggested but never said, particularly the cafe owner's dubious sexuality, and this unstated quality adds real texture to the characters.  In the hands of a contemporary writer, this story would have devolved into identity politics, but McCullers is a real writer, as interested in the individual heart as well as the social.  She earns the added distinction as being the only white writer I've ever read who created complex, sympathetic but multi-dimensional black characters.  Highly recommended.	2000-10-13

Funny, tough, and compassionate, this voice mirrors her characters, some of whom (especially the eponymous Faith) are people you wish you knew, or already do.  At every turn, her characters avoid stereotype, something most self-professed &quot;political&quot; and &quot;feminist&quot; writers fail to do. Three volumes of stories are collected here; the first volume, I think, is the richest.  Here Paley is content to represent the hilarious, yet tragic, travails of her characters.  In the later volumes, aside from being more experimental in form, she tackles overtly political themes.  But the voice never fails her, and even the most dogmatic, contrived story is lifted above the ordinary.  Paley never loses her compassion for mankind.  At the end of her career, this was her abiding them: when faced with cynicism or compassion, she always extended the latter to her fellow human beings.  These are great, tough stories, worthy of reading several times over.  Please buy this collection and spread the word.  Paley is that dying breed -- an American original.	2000-10-13

Although critics, to a man, preferred the longer stories, I find the shorter ones equally compelling.  The writing is first-rate; it is nuanced, poetic, and contains a wealth of psychological insight.  I think this is Phillps's greatest accomplishment: her merging of the psychological and the political in stories that are always accessible.  Those looking for pretension will find it only with reviewers who trash sophisticated story-tellers while including the (see more about me) tag at the beginning of their own reviews.	2000-10-05

This is obviously beginner fiction and it is very good by that standard;  unfortunately, beginner fiction really isn't deserving of the money we pay  to read it.  I've been in several writing workshops at an undergraduate  level (I just graduated,) and you wouldn't believe how horrible most  aspiring writers are (myself included).  I mean, even in the best  manuscript you found uneven pacing, semi-developed characters, incoherent  ramblings, and a few (and I mean a few) redeeming images. The truth is,  writing is very hard.  I enjoyed reading these stories to see how the  writers tried to get themselves out of tight spots where they might be  stuck and not know how to get from A to B or B to C (other beginning  writers will know what I'm talking about.) I agree with the other reviewers  that some of these stories are without substance, but I don't think it is  acceptable to say that a story is bad because the characters or the  author's vision is bleak.  Perhaps these young writers are only being  honest about what they see around them?	2000-08-22

I'm very picky about fiction, and when I read that this collection of  stories had been a finalist for the NBA, I was expecting something more  than what I got.  Bloom is good at writing a certain type of story -- it  starts off with an interesting hook that grabs your attention; proceeds in  a very conversational tone about characters who are usually confused (in  one story VERY confused); and sort of peters out without any real climax or  deepened insight.  I found these stories very agreeable and sometimes  provocative (the woman who sleeps with her stepson, in particular.) But all  in all, even thoush some of these stories are interrelated and examine the  same characters from different vantage points, the characters still lacked  richness.  Nevertheless, as I said at top, I'm very picky about fiction and  would still recommend this book to someone who wants to read a short story  collection.	2000-08-22

Spence has written one outstanding story (the title story) and has churned  out many acceptable, workmanlike efforts as well; but this, unfortunately,  does not make an interesting collection. The funny, juvenile Seventeen  story (&quot;Isabelle and Violet&quot;,) in particular, sat uncomfortably  beside the more depressed, serious pieces about adults. It seems to have  been crammed into the collection because it was published somewhere.  Most  of these stories I forgot after I read them; some I even forgot as I was  reading them.  Judging from the final story, Spence has got real talent,  but even the brightest talent needs a decade or two to develop, and I hope  she isn't in a rush to publish anytime soon.	2000-08-22

Unlike most people, I came to  Meryl Streep very late in her career and so wasn't around to read all the  press that surrounded her in the late 70s and early 80s.  This book is very  generous in relaying information that Meryl gave in interviews, as well as  what other actors and critics say about her (Pauline Kael should get a  life, or a new prescription for her eyeglasses).  There were tons of  pictures as well.  Clearly, a more interesting and complex ARTIST than the  fashion-conscious eye-candy that passes for serious actresses these days.	2000-08-10

I had very high expectations, which were not  met.  Although passages of this book are quite beautiful and sensitive  (most of which concern his wife and her dying mother) I was overwhelmed by  how Bellow uses the main character as a megaphone through which to  pontificate on contemporary race relations. He dramatizes nothing and  leaves nothing for the reader to do. The setting, side by side, of a  racially-inspired murder in Chicago and the death of an old woman in a  communist country is certainly interesting, but way too subtle for me,  especially in light of how heavy-handed Bellow is in other parts of the  narrative.  Still, I read this novel over two years ago and am still  thinking of it; parts of it come back to me like a sepia-toned postcard,  very fleeting.	2000-08-10
US	50680221	R25KM1CA2DOD5H	038072717X	692126822	Katharine Hepburn	Books	2	4	9	N	N	Astonishingly mediocre	For me, Katharine Hepburn was one of the great screen actresses of the  20th century; her work in LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT is harrowing.   After an earlier career as a comedienne and leading lady, she began doing  extremely difficult character work in motion picture adaptions of Tennesse  Williams plays and others. Her later work was brilliant. But the book only  alludes to her flowering as a great tragic actress and instead focuses, as  all Hepburn bios must, on her romance with Spencer Tracy and other men who  were either married or not able to bring Kate to her knees.  As a person, I  find Hepburn to be unbearable, or, more kindly, bull-headed and aggresive.   I guess this makes her a feminist hero. But it's interesting that bios of  Hepburn, for all the nods to how proto-feminist she was, still focus on her  love life whereas discussions of Bette Davis (her equal in talent and  personal strength) focus more on her work and how determined she was,  career-wise. Personally, I find Hepburn's work much more inspiring than her  relations with a married man and would like to see a critical discussion of  her distinguished career.	2000-08-10

It delves into her  acting in much more detail than the other biographies, which seem to only  list her acting awards and leave it at that.  I was extremely pleased to  see a discussion of Streep's work in PLENTY, which was so understated and  low-pressure and unlike anything she had done before.  It's interesting to  watch Streep's performances and discover not only the different characters  she plays, but the different acting STYLES she seems to have at her  disposal.  Her work in PLENTY was certainly different than her fettered,  mannered (but equally brilliant and appropriate) interpretation of Karen  Silkwood.  This kind of attention to her craft really places this book at  the top of the heap.  I would love to see an updated version of this book  because of all the great performances she has given since then (A CRY IN  THE DARK, POSTCARDS, DEATH BECOMES HER, MARVIN'S ROOM, BRIDGES, ONE TRUE  THING, etc.) but I realize that excellence doesn't sell books anymore to  the public, so let's all buy the juicy Gwyneth Paltrow bio and find out  what the new fall fashions are.	2000-08-10

Don  Delillo takes up the challenge and, I think, hits a home run.  This book  isn't perfect, but it is filled with so much insight into contemporary  pop/urban/postmodern culture that I kept turning the pages with my jaw  hanging.  Delillo has the gift to make familiar things look strange and to  see contemporary culture with a fresh eye.  The narrative is incredibly  sophisticated, as it jumps from character to character.  At times, the  narrative seems to be following the mythic home run ball that one of the  characters is searching for.<br />The one criticism I cannot tolerate of  Delillo's work is that he doesn't write full &quot;three-dimensional  characters&quot; involved in tightly written plots and narratives which  build to a climax, ala John Irving and Charles Dickens.  Delillo can't be  expected to write novels like Dickens because he's not writing about the  19th century!  The shape and flow of Delillo's narratives seem more akin to  the movies and television, and the cool sheen of his language is a more  honest representation of our superficial times.	2000-08-09

Maybe an essay?  I've always felt that the essay is Walker's true form but that after  inserting cliched dialogue and onion-skin thin characters, she thinks it's  a novel.  Clearly her fans like this type of writing, judging by the  testimonials (&quot;I read it until I cried...&quot; &quot;It will change  your life&quot;)in full display on this site.  Unfortunately, those looking  for a rigorous reading experience or even a finely wrought story need to  look elsewhere. Walker's writing style can best be described as an  elementary school primer, and her insights into African culture are bland.<br />I'm appalled that an American (no matter how oppressed) presumes to  speak for Africans and puts their cultural practices in the framework of  20th century American culture.  Read the response of the reviewer from  Senegal to hear what an African thinks about this representation.	2000-08-09

After having finished this novel, I have now read six of Ann Beattie's  books -- her first four, written in the late 70s and early 80s, and two  recent novels ANOTHER YOU (1995) and this book  PICTURING WILL (1989).   Clearly something happened during the intervening years.  Whereas Beattie's  early fiction was full of odd characters, delightful non-sequiters, and  brilliant dialogue, PICTURING WILL is dull, dull, dull.  The characters are  totally bland and whereas a muscular plot might have fleshed them out more,  there is no plot to speak of.  Beattie looks at the lives of character and  explains, explains, explains; she doesn't DRAMATIZE.  This tendency not to  dramatize was brilliantly exploited in her earlier work, which recreated  the ennui and anomie of her characters lives in prose that was razor sharp.   PICTURING WILL is filled with none-too-original characters doing nothing  much in prose that is lackluster and undistinguished.  PICTURING WILL is so  bad it makes ANOTHER YOU look distinguished.	2000-08-08

Her writing style is best described as a manic rush, as clauses and phrases and complete sentences bump into each other, without punctuation, to recreate the fever  pitch of life on edge. This style, naturally, works better in compressed  form than when dragged out across a 700 page narrative.  (Believe me, I've  tried reading many of her novels.) In the WHEEL OF LOVE she is a little  more restrained.  This is an early collection of hers and contains some of  her best and best-known stories.  Forget &quot;In the Region of Ice,&quot;  the first story, but &quot;Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been&quot;  is a classic. It's frightening and can be read on so many levels. Oates is  very good at describing the seamy side of otherwise &quot;normal&quot;  people, but after a point I began to wonder what she thinks the point of  her writing is.  More interesting as a pschologist and sociologist than  literary writer.	2000-07-26

All of these flaws are brought  together, exponentially, in this text. The faults are too many to go into  great depth: the narrative is too fractured; too much &quot;poetry&quot;  (poetry, Toni, is concrete and minimal, not flowery); one-dimensional  characters.  But the worst flaw is how Morrison dodges saying anything  critical about black people or women, and instead, after a brutal  execution, everyone is forgiven and lives on in paradise.  Toni, this  response to the world is too easy.	2000-07-26

Granted, I'm not a Phd. in art history, so I can't claim how much of Foster's thinking is his own and how much he &quot;borrows,&quot; but these essays, all interrelated and commenting on each other, carefully dissect  postwar art, culture, politics, theory.  I've read these essays four or  five times and come away with a different insight on art each time.  The  definite highlight for me was the essay on traumatic realism (which ranges  from the opposing simulacral and ideological readings of Warhol, to the  tearing of the screen in Cindy Sherman, to the abject in art, to the  opposing needs to deconstruct the subject and also reaffirm the subject in  racial/sexual/cultural discourse.) Whew! It's a daring essay and is the  rosetta stone, I think, of the entire book. His insight on the loss of  critical distance (which accounts for why the Left and Right sound so much  alike these days)needs to be heeded. Long live all the October writers!	2000-07-26

These are truly menacing portraits of ordinary people in ordinary  situations.  I felt very uneasy reading these plays, as if language in  Pinter's world is steadily losing its ability to signify.  I imagine acting  in a Pinter play must be incredibly difficult. &quot;THE BIRTHDAY  PARTY&quot; was fantastic.  What exactly is a Pinter play?  I wish I could  say, definitively, but I'm at a loss.  Mostly these people are terrified by  people on the fringes of their lives(outside their windows, in the basement  of an apartment, in the same inn) who don't reveal their intentions but  seem to want to do harm to the main characters.  Sometimes, I think that  Pinter's characters recognize the menace within themselves and project it  onto other people.  Part of the greatness of Pinter's work is that I'm at a  loss to explain it.	2000-07-26

Her interest in myth, history, a decentered narrator, racialized images of self, and aural language were well ahead of most critics and theorists, who  are only now recognizing the full worth of her work.  These collected  interviews allow us to hear from the horse's mouth what her narrative  project is.  For Morrison fans, it is particularly interesting to see how  the various white interviewers grapple with Morrison's insistence on  writing about the culture she knows best -- black culture -- and not  putting whites front and center.  It is also interesting to see how  Morrison herself switches positions throughout her career, from an  insistence that she writes only for herself (early in her career) to  writing for &quot;the [black] tribe&quot; (middle of her career)to writing  for seemingly everybody (later career).  A particular treat, for me, were  references scattered throughout to how &quot;prickly&quot; Morrison can be  and how catty she was about not being nominated for a National Book Award  for SONG OF SOLOMON.	2000-07-26

It defies easy summary, so I'm not going to even try.  Needless to say, this is one of those great novels that other novels will be compared to if they too want to be considered great. It's  black, vitriolic humor, coupled with Dickensian characters, biting social  commentary, complex symbolism, and picaresque adventures combined to make  this the best read I've head in years.  Oskar Matzerath is permanently  etched in my mind, right along with Hamlet, David Copperfield, Heathcliff,  and Oedipus.  His hilarious take on his parents (including his presumptive  father, Matzerath) and just about every other grotesquerie in Germany is  unforgettable.  This book is only for those who need a strong dose of  SERIOUS literature, a blast to their brains; no Oprah book-clubbers need  apply.

Doctorow is one of the few historical novelists who has something significant to say about American history and  doesn't just appropriate famous historical figures to give their books  marketing value (yes, I'm talking about BLONDE, by Joyce Carol Oates.)   This book is pretty great.  If you haven't read it, you'll enjoy it.  If  you like a good read -- interesting characters, humour, vivid imagery, and  a suspenseful plot -- you'll love it.  If you're interested in literary  form and ideological engagement (like the capitalism comment above) you'll  also enjoy it.  This seems to be Doctorow's strength -- combining good  old-fashioned narrative with serious literary critique in a way that should  make Tom Wolfe jealous.  The opening, where the gangster gets his feet  cemented, sets a dazzling tone for the rest of the novel, and this is one  book that keeps getting better as it goes on.  Buy this one and enjoy.	2000-07-26

He shows how metafictionists like Calvino and Barth try to represent the world in its totality at a time in history  (Post WWII) when racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual differences were  exploding into the public consciousness.  Calvino, especially, struggled  bravely, but Francese sees in his project a totalizing attempt at  universality which cannot recognize the power of difference.  Against this  strategy, Francese positions Toni Morrison, E. L. Doctorow, and Tabbuchi,  who disperse authorial power in their narratives and do not attempt to  represent the world in any grand, overarching scheme.  The section on  Morrison's novel BELOVED is particularly impressive and shows how  incredibly talented and philosophically informed she is. The use of the  choral narrator, and aural gaps, allow the readers to participate in the  telling of the tale.  Additionally, Morrison intervenes in history by  telling a story that has been &quot;written out&quot; of history, and in  doing so, her readers are able to make connections between the past and  present.  This may sound heady but Francese is extremely clear.  My only  criticism is that Doctorow's book THE WATERWORKS doesn't really illustrate  the point he is trying to make.	2000-07-26

Read &quot;The Beggar Maid&quot;  immediately, and then proceed directly to &quot;Fits&quot; and  &quot;Material.&quot;  There isn't a weak link in this collection.

This was the first time Morrison tried to deal with contemporary life (the  second time was Paradise) and she fails, miserably.  Insted of offering an  intelligent critique of consumer culture, Morrison contrasts consumer  culture (here identified, in all forms, as &quot;white&quot; and  Eurocentric) against a mythical blackness, represented by the character Son  and his podunk hometown, Eloe.  Son escapes some ship and hides in the  house of a wealthy white couple, who just happen to have paid for a young  black model to go to the Sorbonne.  Morrison carefully sets her stage: on  one side, Jade (the model) who is as white as snow because she rejects her  black heritage and is grateful that the white couple paid for her  schooling; and on the other side is Son and mystical ghosts who visit him,  or some nonsuch.  Naturally, this being a Morrison novel, neither side  wins, but the white people get a good spanking when Morrison reveals that  the wife used to abuse her son and the man is more interest in classical  music than his family.  This couple was written about more memorably, many  times over, by Edward Albee in VIRGINIA WOOLF.  Is this the best critique  Morrison has to offer?  Against consumer culture she posits, what, ghosts?   Myth?  Myth is the very tool of capitalism. Again, Morrison has failed to  show how real black people actually live (watching television and reading  the paper, not listening to ghosts; living in multi-racial communities, not  conveniently isolated all-black ones)in order to make some sort of point  about the importance of not forgetting your heritage.  When given the  choice between two polar opposites -- mythic blackness or false whiteness  -- why should either Son or Jade choose. Both strategies are complicit with  the capitalist culture Morrison tries to undermine.	2000-07-26

This book isn't, as it is promoted, a dialogue between historicism and  psychoanalysis in which psychoanalysis wins.  Rather, Copjec examines how  historicists misuse or misinterpret Lacan in their theories, which she  seeks to right my proposing different readings of Lacan.  If this review  makes no sense it's because I can't possibly wrap my brain around  everything that Copjec says.  Needless to say, if you have an interest in  theory, read this book.  The first essay on film theory is fascinating, and  the emphasis on the failure of language to signify and how this failure is  marked in language provides an exciting platform on which to rethink the  social subject.

Atwood  imagines a complete WORLD for Grace, a world we enter right into: Grace in  prison, Grace on the voyage to Canada from Ireland, her life as a maid.   The detail is spectacular, as is the writing.  And the narrative is so  propulsive that I literally could not put this book down.  I read huge  hunks of it -- 200 pages or more -- in one sitting, which is extremely rare  for me.  My only complaint is that the ending is a bit of a cop-out; the  answer to the mystery of whether or not Grace killed her employer is  handled too much like farce.

At no point does Walker give her narrative over to anything like rising action, metaphor, characterization,  or a believable narrative voice.  Instead, she harps on her themes about  the differences between black women and black men, and the solidarity that  can be found between all women (oh, and how a womanist consciousness can be  achieved by wearing overalls and a man's hat!)  What a scream. With  absolutely no ear for dialogue, Walker plods on through banal image after  banal image until the final scene, which uses a crazy old woman who thinks  she's pregnant as comic relief.

I'll try to stick to this one book, the only one of his novels I managed to finish, thus the two stars instead of one.  This book seems to be a tongue-in-cheek  commentary on magic realism, which was quite popular in some quarters  during the mid-80's.  Updike who usually treats the infidelity of the  white-middle class, here treats infidelity among a group of white  middle-class witches.  Some stretch.  All I really want to say is that  there is no strong narrative (as usual with Updike), minimal  characterization (none of the three witches stand out in my mind, except  for the one with cancer,) no tension or drama, but meticulous attention  paid to lush imagery and symbolism, lushness to the point of rot. If only  Updike didn't say the same thing over and over again he might be freed to  streamline his prose by saying something new. I really wish people who call  Updike a genius would read something like THE TIN DRUM or GRAVITY'S  RAINBOW.	2000-07-26
