After a while I felt like I was sinking in the bog that Capote was describing.  The main characters were not very belivable - very two dimensional.  However, because of the descriptive language, I really felt that I was in the time aplace - I'm just not sure it was a time or place I wanted to be.	2005-10-13

This strongly reflects the character of the American people, as well as the nation itself. <br /> <br />But the strength of Look Homeward Angel is in the prose.  Wolfe's writing brings to light those passing moments in time that stay with us forever but which we don't recognize at the time as significant - the glory of the air in an early spring morning, the sensual stimuli that are all around us walking down a dark street late at night, and many other unforgetable scenes.  His writing has the power and vitality of Faulkner, without the sometimes impossible sentences that cause one to lose track.  It is challenging and rich.  Look Homeward, Angel is a masterpiece of place, time, and style.	2005-10-09

War Trash brings this war back into focus with power and insight.  Today the media show us two Koreas - South Korea as a hot spot for capitalism and power - North Korea as a member of the Evil Axis.  This division did not exist prior to the Korean War.  War Trash gives us insight into how that split came into being and why the two nations, although sahring a long history, are now so very different. <br /> <br />We also get insight into the difference between Taiwan and mainland China.  The power structures and beliefs are expressed in the setting of a POW camp, but they are equally applicable to the countries themselves.  Both have their cruel and harsh sides, yet both are capable of compassion and caring.   <br /> <br />This struggle between cruelty and compassion are the backbone of War Trash.  Jin's first-person story is chilling and touching, shocking and emlightening.	2005-09-13

Anything that Ms. Smith endorses, I will be glad to try.  And When the Finch Rises turns out to be well worth the price.  Yes, this book is about friendship and love, but it is much more than that.  Mr. Riggs delves into issues of taking responsibility for ones actions and willingness to face life head on.  Strangely enough, it is the children who are the strongest characters since they have not succumbed to their weaknesses as the adults have.  This book is both charming and thought provoking. <br /> <br />The only negative comment I have is that each chapter, although linked by plot, seemed almost like separate short stories.  This is not necessaily bad, but it does keep the book from flowing quite as smoothly as it could. <br /> <br />But this is only a minor criticism.  It is well worthg reading.  Enjoy!	2005-09-06

The writing is very simple, yet in no way shallow.  This is most appropriate since the story is seen through the eyes of a largely illiterate yet very sensitive young woman.  Vermeer's paintings, reproduced in color, help make the story more relevant and meaningful. <br /> <br />My only gripe is that the story was a bit too hard on the gender roles.  All the men seemed letcherous, although many of the women were not paradigms of virtue.  But this is a persponal gripe and does not detract from the quality or beauty of a great little book.	2005-09-02

Russo is very adept at painting a picture of a small, blue collar New England town that is slipping from prosperity into oblivion.  This slip portrayed in both the town and its citizens.  Following the plight of the whole cast of charatcers was fascinating and engaging. <br /> <br />However, the plot was rather predictable.  I was disappointed that so many of the twists were predictable, making them lose some of their punch.  Also, the ending left me with an incomplete feeling - and then what happened?   <br /> <br />I definitely recommend reading Empire Falls.  It is a fast read and very well written.  Unfortunately, for me, it left me feeling a bit unfulfilled.	2005-08-25

This easy to read book draws some fascinating conclusions, many of which have been discussed in other reviews.  However, I'm not sure that this is Economics at all.  By my dictionary, Economics is defined as \\"the science of the production, distribution, and consumption of comodities.\\" (Concise American Heritage Dictionary).  Other than oblique references as to how to get ahead in a crack ring, this is not touched on at all.   <br /> <br />This book is about the use of statistics, plain and simple.  Statistics can be molded to derive most any conclusion.  Levitt makes interesting use of statistics to come up with unusual conclusions.  But this is not Economics.  All that Levitt is advocating is for us to think outside the box and see beyond our foregone conclusions.  This is a valuable lesson, but certainly nothing new. <br /> <br />I can see why this is a best seller - it is very simple to read and it is very clever.  But that is all.  Nothing more.	2005-08-18

Maybe I was too young or maybe it was truly a mediocre book, but I was not at all impressed.   <br /> <br />My father (a wise Eiropean who knows me too well) bought The Human Stain for me so I thought I would give it a chance - and I'm very glad I did.  This book digs deep into my soul and forces me to question the stains that make me human.  What are those stains?  How have they transformed my life?  Are they stains that need to be bleached out or should they be worn with pride?  All these questions and so many more are raised by Roth in this most probing novel. <br /> <br />In addition, I have been treated to some truly brilliantly developed characters.  Although the motives of some are opaque to me, they in some way are reasonable.  After all, we do often accept that which we cannot understand and grow from that acceptance. <br /> <br />Get this book.  It will make you think.  Scary!!!!!!!!	2005-08-13

We bought the book immediately, but it took a while for me to read it.  I am really glad that I did though.  Mr. Fleming's upbringing in the very depressed south was fascinating and opened my eyes to a life that was very foreign to me.  However, the most powerful part came close to the end, and I quote from page 416: \\"In a fancy new Jackson mall, two young black women having lunch at Primo's Restaurant lectured me at passionate length on how nothing was better.  A decade earlier they might have been beaten or killed but here they were, eating stuffed flounder surrounded by white patrons not paying any attention, with a white waitress asking, 'Can I get you ladies anything else?'\\" <br /> <br />These changes and our acceptance of the status quo make this book essential reading.  We cannot forget history and its lessons, no matter how unpleasant those lessons might be.  Karl Fleming gives us an inside view of a most important part of human history.  Lest we forget... <br /> <br />Thank you, Mr. Fleming for sharing your story with us.	2005-08-01

It was recommended by the tour guide.  I visit Miami about once a year and always hope to have the opportunity to visit the Everglades.  I have known that they are a very special, spiritual place on the edge of a huge city. <br /> <br />However, River of Grass has helped me better understand the unique place that this wilderness holds.  It is an ancient area that was the sight of much fighting, greed, and sorrow.  It is one of the very few places left where the Native American people fought and, to some degree, won.  This, in and of itself, is fascinating.  There is a deep and ancient culture that Ms. Douglas discusses and explains with great beauty and respect. <br /> <br />And then there is the River itself.  The Everglades have been the sight of some of the most contentious environmental battles in North America.  Ms. Douglas identifies the warring parties and comes down firmly in the camp of the environmentalists.  This adds a great deal of power and conviction to the book. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this book if you have an interest in South Florida beyond the beaches and the tourist sights.	2005-07-27

However, as I read on, I realized that the anti-smeitism that is discussed is truly a universal feature of modern day life.  I took this knowledge and was able to apply it to other groups as well as to Jews.  Very blatant stereotypes are everywhere.  Blacks are only proficient as musicians and athletes. Gay and inter-race marriage destroy the traditional family.  All Mexicans are poor and uneducated.  Genide in Rwanda is not our problem.  What is particularly scary now is government-endorsed hatred within the United States - Bush calling for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage - the strong support received by the Minutemen force on the Mexican border. <br /> <br />If these issues bother you, and they should, I would recommend reading this book.  I would also recommend supporting the Southern Poverty Law Center in their fight against hate groups.	2005-06-29

The characters are well developed and Kidd paints a very vivid picture of the times.<br /><br />However, I had two major problems with the book.  First, the sociological background is questionable.  Somehow, I cannot fathom a fourteen year old girl living in rural South Carolina being ignorant of racism in 1964 and being so shocked when confronted with it.  She grew up in a town full of good old boys and field workers.  Come on - get real here - racism was (and is) a fact of life.  Kidd presents a whilte child hitchhiking with her black servant.  She would be shot rather than passed up by cars.<br /><br />The other problem that I had was with Kidd's treatment of men.  Although there are a few positive male images in the book, generally men are portrayed as unfeeling, uncaring and ignorant.  Let's let that stereotype die, along with the one that says that all women are caring and sensitive.<br /><br />Both of these problems resulted from trying to put more into this book than was warrented.<br /><br />For those interested, I would recommend anything by Lee Smith (especially Oral History or Failr and Tender Ladies) or The Little Friend by Donna Tartt.  Both of these Southern women writers do much the same as Kidd, except more successfully (IMHO).	2005-06-21

As an EFM mentor of 7 years, I highly recommend this book as background and supporting reading for Years 2 and 3.  It contains a wealth of information covered in these years as well as lots of additional information about many of the documents that did not make ther final cut into the New Testament.  White covers his material in very clear prose and relies heavily on boxes to summarize complex material.  This should be invaluable in your EFM studies.  So, I recommend getting this book and using it throughout year two and in the beginning of year 3. <br /> <br />To the general public, I do issue a caveat related to this book.  This is not a book about Jesus.  It is a book about the environment in which Jesus lived and about the growth of the Jesus movement through the first two centuries.  It is NOT a Bible commentary, although it is a great companion for Bible study.	2005-06-17

Gad Beck was an organizer and friend to many who lived illegally during that period, finding shelter and food and providing friendship and support.  That he was openly gay was not important during that period - there were more important thiongs to worry about.   <br /> <br />I found this book at the bookstore of National Haulocost Museum in Washington DC on a recent visit.  It fits in perfectly with that museum, in that it fleshes out the life in hiding.  If you have an interest in the struggle for human rights and length to which people will go to survive, this is an excellent read. <br /> <br />One fact that is underemphasized in the book is Beck's youth during this period.  By the end of the war he was in his younger 20s.  Yet he had accomplished so much and had the strength of one much older.  Bravo!	2005-05-31

The first part covers the childhood of the hero, Pi.  I found this part fascinating for its insights into French-dominated areas of India and Pi's understanding of the universality of faith. <br /> <br />This faith is carried over metaphorically into the second half of the book.  This is where the book loses steam.  The metaphor is a bit weak at times and the story becomes beyond incredulous.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good book, but it is not a great book.	2005-05-31

This is the perception most of us have of Francis.  Cunningham's book serves to take this image and place it in a historical context.  Francis was a devout and very orthodox Christian.  He was very literal in his understanding of the mission, life and death of Christ.  His understanding led him to radical views on life - while remaining firmly planted in his church and its traditions. <br /> <br />This book is part theology, part history, part sociology.  It is an easy and thought provoking read, although the teminology Cunningham uses is sometimes theological and obscure to those without some basis is Christianity. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-05-24

The writing is excellent and engaging.  The situation covered - the Rwandan slaughter of Tutsis by the ruling Hutus - is frightening in that it truly shows the worst in humanity.  The descriptions are vivid and alive. <br /> <br />However, I do have a couple of issues with the book.  The first is that Gouravitch definitely has a bias in relating this story.  It leaves one with a feeling of only hearing half the story.  Although this is possibly inevitable, a more balanced presentation would have helped me better understand the rationale for genocide, if one can possibly be found. <br /> <br />Secondly, I got lost in all the acronyms and the names.  An appendix with a list of the acronyms would have been very helpful in following the events described.  So too would a list of the main contacts that Gouravitch uses in his book.  Many of the names are very long and unfriendly to English-speaking ears.  Again, the book would have been easier to read and even more powerful with these listings in an appendix. <br /> <br />But overall, the book is extremely enlightening and deeply troubling.  If you read this review before reading the book, begin an appendix of your own as you read.  Your work will be well rewarded.	2005-05-16

Midrash takes a story from the Bible and weaves a tale around it that helps explain and embelish the meaning of the incident.  It uses references from the original source to help explain how and why an incident occurred and how it relates to our lives today. <br /> <br />The Red Tent takes the story of Dinah and uses it as a window to explore the world of women in world of early Old Testament times.  Women lived in a separate world, but one that was very rich and full of life, pain, and most of all love.  We don't usually get a glimpse of this because so many of the stories told about this period are told by men, who were excluded from the women's world.  (Is it so very different today?)  Is the life presented 100% accurate?  Probably not.  But it seems to carry the spirit of the times and opens a world that is obscured by the patriarchal writing of the Old Testament. <br /> <br />The book is graphic in places and even blasphemous, but that is viewing the world through today's very narrow vision.  Worship of idols was (and is) common.  Birth, life and death were seen as part of the natural flow of life. <br /> <br />I recommend this book as a path to opening our eyes to things that we don't usually see.  This is the best that fiction can do.	2005-04-30

It is very limited in that the poverty and lifestyle of the time discouraged travel and worldliness, and yet the book is very full because the characters are universal.  I find this to be Jones' strength both in this novel and in his short stories.  Hard times destroy some and build up others.  How we react to our own Known World is determined by so many factors, only a few of which are obvious.  It is not our wealth or poverty.  It is not the character of our parents.  It is not our level of education.  But it is our soul.  Jones is supurb at elucidating this point. <br /> <br />As for the text itself, it opened up a new world for me - the world of black slaveholders and the class structures of the antebellum south.  Great stuff!  The very fluid writing kept the book interesting and moving quickly.  The list of characters in the appendix was a great help in keeping track of the many characters.  It is meant to be referenced, especially at the start when the characters are still being developed.	2005-04-18

Except for the Grapes of Wrath, I have found them too long for the point they are trying to make.  Of Mice and Men is much more concise and yet provides a real punch.  The punch is not so much in the ending as in the character development.  In such a short piece, we have the priviledge of seeing the power of a true friendship that is based on caring and respect.  The setting is vivid and intense - much like the country where it takes place.  This is an excellent, quick read and I highly recommend it.	2005-03-28

This is interesteing to read, but is there truly anyone who is even vaguely political who doesn't know these things?  As a life-long democrat, it is fun to read books that bash those who I find lacking, but this is the best thing about the book.

Everything just happened to fall into place perfectly.  After the tone of reality that was present in the rest of the book, this was a let down.

If you want a nice story about a piano teacher, please look elsewhere.  The Piano Teacher is a bit raw, dealing with very unhealthy relationships and twisted understandings of self.  These twisted understandings are manifested sexually, in rather extreme ways.  Are these characters a bit skewed?  Yes, but we are all a bit skewed, each in our own way.  Admitting this can be terrifying, and this is what makes this book so terrifying.  Is it easy to face?  No!  Is it necessary to face?  Yes!   <br /> <br />The writing is excellent.  The short, dramatic language is perfect for the subject - very direct.  The impressive use of metaphore often leaves one gaping. <br /> <br />So, if you are looking for something easy and light, this is not your book.

Is he a total schmuck?  Should I pity him?  How can he live in his own skin?  These characteristics and contradictions within one character testify to the depth and talent of Highsmith's writing.  The other characters are less well developed - a bit two dimensional.  But Ripley's character is enough to keep the book interesting.<br /><br />The plot line comes and goes.  There were some points where I got bored and tired of the self-pitying characters.  But this is who they were and this is how we should see them.<br /><br />Another nice plus is that the book is not set in any particular time.  It was first published in the mid 1950s, but it has a feel of the 1960s \\"beautiful people\\" or of the 1920s.  This lends a feeling of mystery to the writing.	2004-11-30

The book is very logically organized, moving from the atomic level to the macrobiological level of ecology.  I read this book last summer because I really wanted to refresh my knowledge of biology, a subject I studied in college in the mid 1970s.  I now feel that I have a much greater appreciation of the intricacy and depth of life, in all its many fascets.	2004-11-02

Lee Smith is a master of the southern genre, with characters who are completely emersed in the South, and this is her best to date.  The letters in this books keep it moving and keeps the reader engrossed.  It is sad, hopeful, and very full of life.  Read it if you need a treat.	2004-09-14

I was already a fan of Ms L'Engle.  However, this book brought her into a new realm.  I followed the readings quite faithfully during two yearly cycles.  I must say that they provided my those glimpses of grace that were needed during that very difficult time of my life.  These are only glimpses because they are relatively short and easy to digest over breakfast.  However, as so often happens, glimpses open doors that reveal so much more.  My faith in the God of Creation was reaffirmed through this book.  This God accepted me as I was (and am) and affirmed me as good.  What more can one ask from a book of daily reflections?<br />Thank you Ms L'Engle.  I'm proud to call you a fellow Episcopalian!	2001-12-29

I have spent some time visiting a Benedictine monastary and have a good friend who was a postulate there, so I have some basis for my observation.  The sisters were too sweet and kind.  Life seemed more of a Disney fairy tale than anything that would exist at a true convent.<br />That said, the question that the book raises - how does God become known and present in my life and what form does that presence take - is a very relavent and difficult question.  I have pondered this in my life and wondered about why there are times when God seems so far away and other times when God is so near.  Lying Awake asks this question and answers it for a few of the characters.  But it compels me to ask the question for myself and for my life.<br />So, 4 stars because the message is good even if the setting is flawed.	2001-12-27

Restaurant reviews are very helpful and the walking tours get you into the tourist parts of town.  But don't trust the telephone/fax numbers.  Of the three I tried, all were wrong.  Overall, worth using though.	2001-10-29

It speaks about our human relationships - how we tend to place those we love on pedestals and then are deeply shaken when the pedestal collapses.  We make gods of those we love.  We worship that which is missing in ourself.  Some dance to Remember discusses these themes in the context of San Franncisco, but the themes are universal.  For those of us who lived through the gay 70s and 80s in the hinterlands, the insider insights are fascinating.  Get this book and read it.  It is one of the more important books of our time, especially for the gay communitee.  For all who have ever loved and lost, it helps name what we have been through and gives us hope in the resurrection of the self after loss and disillusion.  Good stuff.	2001-06-11

I love books that teach me about things that I don't know about and that help me understand more about what it means to be human.  The Wild Man definitely fills that bill.  The entire world of bull fighting juxtaposed against the rural Spanish setting and the class struggles between the upper class and others in Spain was fascinating.  Ms. Warren surely knows what she's writing about and writes in engaging prose.  I read this book on vacation and it was perfect.<br />Except for the ending.  Somehow it just did not ring true.  There were tremendous shifts in the characters that remained unclear to me.   Also, from my experiences, gay couples rarely stay together for so long, especially those where the partners are so different.  I had trouble with this ending.  I wish things always worked out as positively as they do in The Wild Man.  <br />But overall, it is a good book and well worth reading.  Give it a try for something very different in gay/lesbian literature.	2001-05-28
