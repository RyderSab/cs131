Musgrave writes with clarity and grace, taking the reader to the heart the theory of knowledge. Unlike most introductory texts or short histories, which merely summarize the conclusions of great philosophers, &quot;Common Sense, Science, and Scepticism&quot; focuses on the arguments of the philosophers. Thus, the book is an excellent introduction to what it means to &quot;do&quot; philosophy. The text is rewarding, and anyone interested in philosophy can read it with profit.	2001-01-22

In his preface, Lacey indicates that in writing this dictionary he wanted to \\"give the layman or intending student a pocket encyclopedia of philosophy, one with a bias towards explaining terminology.\\" He fulfills  his purpose admirably; the student can include this dictionary in a back  pack or book bag so that it is available at all times. The more exhaustive  dictionaries, such as the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy or the Oxford  Companion to the mind are simply too big to carry around, and thus are less  likely to be at hand when the student needs them. The entries in Lacey's  dictionary are clear, concise, and sufficiently cross-referenced.  Particularly useful are the substantial bibliographies that follow many of  the entries. I rate this book as four stars, rather than five, because some  of the entries could actually be longer. I believe that this dictionary  could expand on some of the entries without adding significantly to the  length of the book. For example, the entry on Wittgenstein's private  language argument is simply to short to be very useful. Otherwise, when  viewed in light of its purpose, the dictionary is a job well done.	2000-04-26

Although I have an undergraduate degree in philosophy, I have been too busy building a law practice to read much philosophy for the last two decades. I have recently begun to read philosophy again, however, and have started by  reading introductory books. I have found Hollis's &quot;Invitation to  Philosophy&quot; to have all the ingredients of a classic of its kind: 1)  it is concise; 2) it is clearly written; 3) it is a reliable exposition of  the fundamental problems of philosophy; and 4) above all, it is  entertaining. In fact, the book is so enjoyable that I was left thirsting  for more, which is itself an indication that Hollis has succeeded.  Congratulations to Hollis on a job well done.	2000-04-23

Scholars fortunate enough to be familiar with Berman's earlier book, \\"The Nature and Functions of Law,\\" will immediately recognize  Berman's approach to law as a social institution; an approach that is  firmly grounded in history and experience, but which also takes into  consideration the realm of ideas. Berman's thesis is that the Western legal  tradition was created by a series of social \\"revolutions,\\" and that we are  currently at the end of an era and experiencing a \\"revolution\\" that will  transform our legal institutions. \\"Law and Revolution\\" is Berman's attempt  to trace the development of our Western legal tradition in order to glean  knowledge that will be useful to us in weathering the storm of the current  \\"revolution\\" in our legal institutions. As Berman states, \\"So I have had to  view the Western tradition of law and legality, of order and justice, in a  very long historical perspective, from its beginnings, in order to find a  way out of our present predicament.\\" The result of Berman's approach is a  long book-Berman simply could not achieve his purpose in a brief essay.  Berman writes well, however, and he manages always to fascinate the reader.  Berman's depth of thought is as beautiful as it is rare. This is a book to  read, to ponder, and to re-read. It deserves a broad audience both inside  and outside legal academia.	2000-04-10

Shapiro's \\"American Legal Quotations\\" is notable for its ease of use. It is more than simply a listing of pithy quotations. The sections of the book are arranged alphabetically by 208 topic headings and it has a rich index  of authors and key words. Moreover, the quotations are keyed to precise  legal citations so that legal writers can use the quotations with  confidence. As a bonus, the book is fun to browse and read at leisure.

Friedman wrote his landmark \\"A History of American Law,\\" he remarked that American legal history has been a neglected field. Some progress (although not enough) has been made in the field since Friedman  published his History in 1973. Part of that progress has been the  publication of Grant Gilmore's little book, \\"The Ages of American Law,\\"  which is justly considered to be a classic. The book is based on the  lectures Gilmore gave during the 150th Anniversary of Yale Law School for  the Storrs Lecture Series in 1974. Although \\"The Ages of American Law\\" is  an \\"expanded\\" version of the Storrs Lectures, the book is still remarkable  for its concision as well as for its clarity. Gilmore does not purport to  offer an authoritative history of American law in the same vein as  Friedman's History. Rather, he captures the grand sweep of history and  condenses it into a gem of 154 pages. It remains in print nearly  twenty-five years after first publication for good reason-it is well worth  reading.	2000-04-09

The United States, he noted, has no work of legal history comparable to  Holdsworth's monumental \\"History of English Law.\\" Friedman was right about  our neglect of American legal history, and his attempt to remedy that  neglect by writing his History remains the most authoritative history of  American law. Friedman's History is not only authoritative, however. It is  written with clarity and grace, and it is accessible to the general reader.  Any attempt to gain a full understanding of American law will necessarily  be incomplete without a careful reading of this book. It should be required  reading for all law students.	2000-04-08

Is there anyone, save the Marxian fanatic, who would argue that Karl Marx wrote with clarity and grace? English speaking  readers often find even the great English political philosophers, such as  John Stuart Mill, to be somniferous. Thus, a well-written history of  Western political philosophy is not only welcome, but it is a relief.  McClelland's \\"A History of Western Political Thought\\" is such a book.  McClelland not only writes well, but he presents the story of political  philosophy in an interesting and enjoyable way. Both the specialist and the  general reader will profit from this book.	2000-04-08

Richard Popkin assembled a small army of experts to write this history. The result is a text that is useful not only to the scholar, but to the general reader and  student as well. Although a book like this suffers the danger that it will  be simply a collection of unrelated essays on each philosopher or school of  philosophy, Popkin provides notes that connect the separate articles. The  thorough bibliography and index make this book particularly useful. Every  student of philosophy should own a copy. Highly recommended.	2000-04-08

Watch a television game show, such as \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\\" and determine how many questions regarding philosophy are asked of contestants.  The American public seems to have little knowledge of philosophy, lacking  even knowledge of trivia regarding the philosophers (such as names, dates,  doctrines, contributions, or nationalities of philosophers).<br />Perhaps  sensing the need for books on philosophy that are accessible to the general  reader, Oxford University Press publishes quality books on philosophy that  are introductory in nature. One of OUP's recent books targeted at the  non-specialist is Ted Honderich's \\"The Philosophers,\\" which is a short  introduction to twenty-eight great Western philosophers. Each chapter  contains a concise introduction to a great philosopher that is written by  an expert. The book is illustrated with portraits of each of the  philosophers, and includes a Chronological Table of Philosophy. In  addition, each chapter includes a guide to further reading (worthy  additions because the book itself gives the reader just enough information  to spark an interest for further study).<br />Overall, \\"The Philosophers\\" does  an admirable job of introducing the great Western philosophers to the  general reader. Hopefully, Oxford University Press will continue its  commendable effort to bring philosophy to the general reader by publishing  similar books in the future. Highly recommended.	2000-04-08

He states that he wanted to publish a text that introduces law students to the theoretical  underpinnings of the law. He has succeeded admirably in reaching his goal.  It is unfortunately the case that most law schools in the United States  fail to introduce law students to the philosophy of law-such courses are  usually elective, and most students take only courses that will help them  pass the bar or assist them in their jobs. As a result, many American  lawyers have only a superficial understanding of our legal system-they lack  an understanding of the nature and functions of law that would not only  enrich their lives, but that would also prepare them to make more  meaningful contributions to the profession and to society. The Blackwell  Companion can fill this void in law school curriculum, and it should be  required reading for all law school students. Moreover, the approachable  nature of the Companion should prove inviting to the undergraduate. It may  even encourage students that are interested in the nature and functions of  law to attend law school-an institution that is often the haven of those  that are only interested in pursuing or preserving money and prestige.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-08

It was not until recently that I realized the importance of Hobbes's political thought. Therefore, I decided to read Hobbes's &quot;Leviathan.&quot; Having  previously discovered the outstanding little books in the &quot;Past  Masters&quot; series published by the Oxford University Press, I first  looked to see if the series included a title on Hobbes, and I found Tuck's  book, which I read before reading \\"Leviathan.\\" Tuck's &quot;Hobbes&quot;  provided me with a good foundation for reading &quot;Leviathan,&quot; and  Tuck greatly increased my appreciation for Hobbes. Tuck is particularly  careful to describe not only Hobbes's political philosophy; he also  provides an introduction to Hobbes's thought regarding religion, science,  ethics, and philosophical method. By gaining an overall picture of Hobbes's  thought, I came to appreciate Tuck's claim that &quot;Hobbes created  English-language philosophy.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone  approaching Hobbes for the first time.	2000-04-06

His &quot;Short History of  Modern Philosophy&quot; is worth reading for two reasons: 1) it is a model  of fine expository writing; and 2) it is an accessible overview of modern  philosophy that will provide a foundation for further study of the central  philosophers.
