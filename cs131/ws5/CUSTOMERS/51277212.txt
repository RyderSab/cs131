While it does not give a nuts-and-bolts approach as to how to manage one's money, it does give some bedrock principles that will help a person live below his/her means.  The authors here present the case that there are many millionaires in our country who don't appear to be millionaires.  The reason is that the focus of their lives is on building wealth, not consuming goods.  They are also frugal, a quality that most non-millionaires don't possess.<br /><br />This book is an excellent read.  I recommend it highly not as an instructional book on good money management, but as a motivational book on money management.  It is well worth the small price!	2005-10-08

I have a new puppy in my house, and the tips given here are working to this point.

Regardless of our worship heritage, I am confident this title will in some way broaden our horizons when it comes to worship.  The points made here by Rognlien don't really conform to any particular worship tradition.  Instead, his comments transcend worship traditions, drawing upon the best of several and offering fresh new insights as well.<br /><br />This title would definitely be helpful to a minister of worship or a worship leader.	2005-09-17

I'm using this book as a text to teach a class on pastoral care, and I love it!  There is a myriad of books available today on what it means to be a pastor, ranging from titles bashing church growth techniques to works heralding the modern-day pastor as a church CEO.  This book covers the Biblical basics of shepherding for church leaders and pastors, and covers them well.  The author acknowledges a place for managerial skill, but he asserts that the primary role of a church leader/pastor is to shepherd the sheep.<br /><br />I recommend this book enthusiastically!	2005-09-07

As a pastor of over 20 years, I can't recommend this book highly enough to church leaders experiencing conflict in their churches.  Most conflict has its root in offenses of one form or another.  Bevere here provides a long-overdue resource for Christians who have been sidelined from service due to hurt feelings, bruised egos, unfulfilled expectations, etc.  This book is a MUST READ for every church leader, and a MUST BUY for every church library.<br /><br />I've read many Christian books, but I have not found another title that addresses a common root of interpersonal conflict as this one does.  I only wish I had read this book sooner.  If Amazon had a six star rating, I'd give it!	2005-09-03

For many of us, the miraculous nature of the American Revolution has been buried with the history books of a much younger time in our lives.  In this volume, David McCullough brings all the tragedy and triumph of the American Revolution to life once again.  The drama of this year of our nation's birth belongs to history, but the masterpiece of the storytelling belongs to McCullough.  This title is a treasure for young and old alike, for all who now enjoy the freedom so valiantly obtained.	2005-07-23

Instead, I found a smorgasbord of various religions that didn't really seem to do justice to any particular one.  I realize this book is more self-help and self-discovery oriented, but the spiritual overtones were too strong and too garbled to be of any real help.  Ford is a good writer, and she does have some helpful insights on personal care habits, so I give this one two stars.	2005-07-23

For the pastors of board-driven churches, this book is long overdue.  There is a plethora of Christian leadership titles on the market, but they all are geared towards pastoral or individual roles.  In this book, Malphurs focuses on the need for church board members to be well-trained as they lead congregations into the 21st century.  With his rock-solid thought processes and meticulous attention to detail, the author presents a volume that is destined to be a God-send to many struggling churches.  I've read many church health authors, and Malphurs is one of my favorites.  I recommend this book highly.	2005-07-23

The author answers this question with solid research and Biblical values.  In a nutshell, Rainer's research reveals that the secret to keeping members is expecting more of them.  Other insights from his research are presented here as well, but the focus of the book is powerful effect of \\"raising the bar.\\"  This title is a keeper for my pastoral library.	2005-07-23

While most of the tips and insights here offer few ideas that are new to books on Christian marriage, the way in which they are arranged is refreshingly original.  The authors are right on target when they claim that the greatest enemy facing marriages today is isolation.  Other resources touch upon this danger, but this work focuses upon it.  It's not a great book, but it's very good.	2005-07-23

This book focuses on the administration of present ministry.  The title issue aside, the content of this book is extremely helpful and practical for both lay and clergy leaders in the church.  It can be read through from cover to cover, but its best use would be as a reference to consult in specific situations.  The theology here is conservative, while the methodology is very progressive.  I'm pleasantly surprised with this little volume!	2005-07-23

For someone seeking a comprehensive time management system and philosophy, I highly recommend Stephen Covey's writings and audio books.  This title offers many good tidbits on honing time management skills, and for those tidbits I give it three stars. The author fails however, to give any clear cut methodology for determining personal values and highest priorities.<br /><br />This title is good as a supplement on time management, but for a primary volume look for something associated with Covey.	2005-07-03

Rather than just lumping all men and all women into two separate categories, the Parrotts lead each reader through a process that identifies his/her own unique communication style.  Once both partners' styles have been identified, it is then that true \\"Love Talk\\" can begin.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all couples seeking to improve the communication in their marriage. (What couple couldn't use some improvement?)  Although possessing a strong Christian background, the Parrotts do not come across as \\"preachy,\\" but as helpful, insightful, and even transparent as they draw from their own struggles as husband and wife.	2005-06-25

While certainly not politically correct, this volume is Biblically correct in its affirmation of the husband as the servant leader of the household.  Walker divides his work into two halves, the first half addressing men who won't lead, and the second addressing women who won't follow.<br /><br />This book is not to be used as a defense of a complimentarian view of marriage.  For Christians who have a complimentarian view however, it is extremely helpful in putting that view into practice.	2005-06-18

While the theology is a refreshing change from the works of LaHaye and Jenkins, the writing quality is surprisingly poor.  The plot rambles through the first three-quarters of the book, with ancient Roman names abounding and no real story unfolding.  The pace does quicken at the end, but there is no real point made other than the Beast of Revelation being Nero.<br /><br />After reading this title, there is still a need for a top-notch, end-times thriller that presents an \\"Exegetical Eschatology\\" (a term mentioned in the author's afterword).  The effort here is commendable, but the end result earns only two stars.	2005-06-09

As someone who juggles many different responsibilities and a crowded calendar, I approached this title with high expectations.  I was not disappointed!  Covey here offers a revolutionary resource for time management.  Rather than following the standard theme of how to do more in a given period of time, the author emphasizes the importance of setting priorities and planning ahead.  His analogy of the clock and the compass is priceless in describing the two elements that should both be balanced in our prioritizing and scheduling.<br /><br />I've been exposed to many varied techniques of time management, but have not experienced anything as revolutionary and life-transforming as this title.  For anyone who can't find enough time to \\"get everything done that needs to be done,\\" I highly recommend this book.  It's been a huge help to me!	2005-06-04

I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to learn more about ultimate frisbee.  Twenty years ago I was playing this game in a midwestern college, only to return to West Virginia and receive blank stares when I mentioned the term.  Now the sport has grown, with West Virginians as well as people from all over the globe playing!  This title is evidence of the sport's growing popularity.<br /><br />Studarus starts with the basics of ultimate, including the rules of the game, the spirit of the game, and numerous descriptions of how to throw a disc.  He then covers a number of offenses, defenses, and drills to sharpen skills.  The book concludes with some historical information regarding prominent ultimate teams and well-known ultimate players.<br /><br />If you're new to ultimate frisbee and want to learn more, this title is the one to get.  If you're a seasoned ultimate player and don't have this book in your library, it would be a wise investment as a basic primer.	2005-05-18

It does not delve into deep theology, but that direction is not the intent of the authors. Instead, they desire to see Christian couples drawn closer to one another and to encouraged in their commitment to their marriages.<br /><br />I would have given this book five stars, but the Parrotts simply stopped too soon.  Several more days worth of devotionals would have made this title an even better purchase.  The ideas are excellent, but there are simply not enough of them.  Still, it is a good investment for anyone involved in a Christian marriage.	2005-05-14

Her theme is reconciling ourselves to the darker side of our human nature, the things we suppress, the things we deny, the things we resist that all are vital parts of who we are.  While her theology and her therapeutic approach may not be as refined as some people would desire, the point of her work strikes home in the hearts of her readers.  The goal she presents is not permissiveness, but wholeness and healing.  This title is not written from a theological or a psychological viewpoint.  It is written from a personal viewpoint by woman who has a powerful story to share.  In her sharing, she inspires struggling readers with refreshing insights and renewed hope.	2005-05-10

Instead this title is written from the standpoint of higher biblical criticism, looking down on the Scriptures, determining what is and isn't truly historical.  The underlying premise of the author is fatally flawed -- he implies the biblical account is not to be taken as reliable without somehow having to verify it.<br /><br />There are far better treatments of the life of Christ that aren't so undermining of Scriptural authority.  Lee Strobel's work is one example. Strobel's investigative approach is far more scrutinizing than the approach of Thomas, and at the same time is honoring of Scriptural integrity.	2005-05-07

Just about everyone who takes the time to read this title will admit that volunteer ministry is a very good thing and should be greatly applauded.  The problem however, is that those of us who are leaders would appreciate Hybels doing more than just \\"preaching to the choir.\\"  The people needing to hear the message of this book are the very ones who won't be reading it.<br /><br />I respect Hybels and have benefited enormously from his other writings.

I purchased this volume with great expectations, and was sadly disappointed. Perhaps the main reason for my negative response is that this title came across to me as a Christian-oriented guide to management.  For me, the best part of the book was the short postscript at the end.

Still, I have felt for some time that history has been revised in light of the politically correct notions of recent years. After reading Woods' thoughts here, my feeling has been confirmed.<br /><br />Woods starts all the way back at the American Revolution, and moves forward in national history to the Clinton era.  At each point along the way, his words ring true.  He provides a perspective on national events that is not offered in modern texts.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants a different view of American history than what is commonly taught today.	2005-04-08

I was given this book by a friend some time ago, and decided last week to pull it off the shelf.  I'm glad I did.  Dennis and Barbara Rainey, cofounders of \\"Family Life\\" ministry, have a real gift for providing tools that will enhance and invigorate any marriage.  Whether newlyweds or long-time partners, the comments made here by the Raineys will offer insights any husband or wife will find helpful.<br /><br />The first major portion of the book is addressed particularly to wives, written by Barbara.  The second major portion of the book is addressed particularly to husbands, written by Dennis.  The goal of each section is to help each partner better meet the emotional and physical needs of the other.  Reading through the portion addressed to one's spouse will reveal just how on-target the comments are.<br /><br />I've read several books of this nature, and this title is one of the best available for Christian married couples.

Do you need a church mission statement?  Are you trying to find help in determining one?  Then look no further, for this title by Aubrey Malphurs will guide you through the process.  After stressing the importance of a mission statement, the author carefully defines what a mission statement is and isn't.  He then instructs the reader as to the ways to develop a mission statement, to communicate a mission statement, to implement a mission statement, and to preserve a mission statement.<br /><br />Having an entire congregation on the \\"same page\\" for ministry is a tremendous help in mobilizing a congregation to work together in Christian service.  A mission statement establishes that common ground.  For any Christian leader involved in strategic church planning, this volume is well-worth the small investment in time and money.	2005-03-19

For anyone who has read much on the subject, Barna really doesn't share anything new.  What he does do however, is to put many of the trends and concepts together in one volume.<br /><br />There are certainly better books on the market describing specific methods of \\"evangelism that works.\\" This title just identifies the problem in American churches today -- we are falling far short of communicating the gospel of Christ with a lost and dying culture.

Written in 1998, it was a very timely, well-crafted work that gave a wake-up call to the church in America.  As I read it in 2005 however, I wonder, \\"What would Barna say today?\\"  He states here that the next five years for the church would be critical.  Well, the \\"next five years\\" passed by 2003.<br /><br />There are many points here that still apply to the church, just as points made in Barna's \\"Frog in the Kettle\\" still apply.  This book however, is clearly dated.  I would encourage a potential reader to look for a more recent treatment of the church as it presently stands in American society.	2005-03-16

Unfortunately, these two traits are the strengths of the title.

I can also appreciate his tips for tempering the control freak within me.  His words are candid, thoughtful, and enlightening.<br /><br />This book is a good read for anyone who interacts a great deal with people.  Strained relationships can be mended and strengthened by taming the control freaks around us, and most importantly the control freak within us.	2005-03-14

While being a bit too harsh towards church health proponents, the author overall makes a very strong point about the necessity of prayer in experiencing the movement of God in a fresh way.  If America's churches are to experience another \\"great awakening\\" as in times past, the key is found within these pages.<br /><br />Pastors would do well to read this book, as would all church leaders.  It calls us all back to the basics -- crying out to God and experiencing what only He can do.  This title is definitely a must-read.	2005-03-13

I read my first book by Aubrey Malphurs while completing a doctorate in ministry eight years ago.  Recently it has become my goal to read everything he has written, because his insights for church ministry in the 21st century are simply unparalleled.  This title is the second in a three-part series on leadership.  Here he continues where he ended in his first work, \\"Becoming Leaders.\\"  The third title, \\"Leading Leaders\\" is due to be released in the near future.<br /><br />This book, for all its merits, is not an easy-read.  Malphurs is extremely detailed and thorough as he examines the leadership building process for the local church.  Still, any pastor serious about developing leaders in his congregation should not be without it.	2005-03-13

If the original book could give me so much valuable insight into loving my wife, this title could certainly help me with my teen.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Chapman here not only covers the five love languages as they relate to teenagers, but also offers help for the challenges that many teens and their parents face.  Dealing with anger, failure, and blended families are among the issues that the author addresses.<br /><br />This book is excellent reading material for any parent of a teen, or a church worker who interacts with teens.  Buy it and see -- I'm confident you won't be sorry.	2005-03-12

I've heard many comments about this title, but have never taken the time to read it until now.  I HIGHLY recommend it to any married couple as a way to enhance emotional fulfillment in their marriage.  Using five different ways of expressing love, or \\"love languages,\\" Chapman provides key insights as to how to meet the emotional needs of our mate.  In the process, we also learn a great deal about ourselves.<br /><br />These love languages, once identified, also give us insight regarding other relationships in addition to our marriages.

Having read through the 100 pages fairly quickly, I am now disappointed.  I was hoping to find either a very concise guidebook to digital photography or a more substantial work on the subject.  I didn't find either one.  Instead, I encountered a book that takes too many pages to cover too little content.  The information is more technical than practical for an individual new to the field.  For someone more experienced, it would be far too basic.<br /><br />I gave this title two stars because it does have a few helpful points.  If you are looking for a beginner's primer, look elsewhere.  Better books can be purchased for the money.	2005-03-02

Some of us do better with the balancing act than others.  Many of us wonder, \\"Are there better ways I can commune with God on a regular basis?\\"  Thomas states here that there are better ways, once we have discovered as God has placed them in us.<br /><br />Thomas identifies nine \\"sacred pathways\\" that are present in differing degrees in Christians.  Naturalists love God in nature.  Sensates worship God through their five senses.  Traditionalists walk with God through ritual and symbolism.  Ascetics draw strength from solitude with God and from simplicity.  Activists energize themselves spiritually through confrontation.  Caregivers best worship God by caring for the physical needs of others.  Enthusiasts love God with mystery and celebration.  Contemplatives interact with God via adoration.  Intellects love to serve God with their minds.<br /><br />The author includes at the end of each chapter a questionnaire, so that reader can quiz himself to see how strong of an inclination he has in each pathway.  Most people have two to three pathways that are dominate.<br /><br />This title is excellent.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of consistent devotional time with God.	2005-02-23

I've reviewed many books here, and seldom do I say that one is a must-read for every pastor.  This title however, falls into that category.  Not only is it of enormous benefit to pastors, but it will be very helpful in granting insight to others who want to understand better the enormous challenges we face and the dark side we all possess.<br /><br />For pastors, this book is eye-opening in asserting that all of us must deal with a dark side in one form or another.  For people supportive of us, this volume takes us off any super-human pedestal (we never really belonged there in the first place).  It does so by providing insight into our very unique humanity that we too often deny.<br /><br />This book is the first of its kind, and hopefully not the last.  It is well worth the small investment required to purchase and the short time required to read.	2005-02-19

In this title, the author describes the pastor of smaller, struggling congregation that needs to establish a godly direction for its future.  Pastors of single-staff churches have challenges of a completely different nature than pastors of multi-staff churches.  Malphurs here makes sure that strategic planning principles are seen as helpful to smaller church bodies as well as the larger ones.	2005-02-18

I'm a little disappointed with some of the negative reviews here.  This book does nothing to dilute Christian theology, but instead seeks to offer new methodology to meet the needs of younger generations.  So many of the titles on the market today are addressed towards builders and boomers, while this book focuses more on busters and bridgers (youngest generations).<br /><br />Kimball doesn't insist that everyone follow his particular methodologies here, he just offers new ideas for previously unreached people.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly, especially to worship planners.  The insights it gives are extremely helpful for reaching post-modern worshippers.  These generations are becoming increasingly prevalent in our world today.<br /><br />This volume is simply great!	2005-02-11

As such, it offers a variety of practical lessons and insights on the man and his mission.  This title is good, but not great.  It is however, the best leadership devotional I have read based on Paul's life.

While some people may feel his tone is zealous to a fault, the truth of his words cannot be denied.  Caffeine IS an addictive drug.  Caffeine IS harmful for the body.  Granted, there are many other things we consume that are harmful as well, but that does not negate the author's argument.<br /><br />I have been a coffee lover for many years, but have been a believer in physical fitness and sensible nutrition for an even longer period of time.  In the back of my mind I always have been aware of the perils of caffeine.  This author has brought all those thoughts to the forefront.  As a result, I am weaning myself off this harmful, yet widely accepted, substance.<br /><br />Yes, pretty much everyone in our society drinks caffeine, blind to the dangers.  Fifty years ago pretty much everyone in our society smoked tobacco, blind to the dangers.  We've realized the dangers now of tobacco -- will the dangers of caffeine be the next great realization?<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I especially recommend it to people who have lives with high-stress and are mindlessly guzzling caffeine.  Buy this title -- it will make you think, and will probably put you on the path to a much more serene existence.	2005-01-30

This small book is just right for a novice/beginner photographer who wants to get familiar with the D70.<br /><br />There are plenty of color photos that show clearly the various buttons and settings required for different functions.<br /><br />If you want detailed, advanced instruction, look elsewhere.

The first two parts of this three-part volume offer insights as to why the church is increasingly ineffective in ministering to buster and bridger generations.  They describe how throughout its history, the church has been slow to harness technological advances for use in the cause of Christ.  After making a convincing argument for the need for relevance in an information-based world, father and son offer a short rationale in part three as to how the church can use the Internet in a very positive manner for ministry.<br /><br />This book is NOT a \\"how to\\" book on ministry via the Internet, but a \\"why to\\" book.  It is a good introduction of the rationale for the church ministering online.  For the Christian wary of the Internet or uncertain of its usefulness for the church, this book is fine choice.	2005-01-26

I read this book twenty years ago, and after reading it once again it still speaks volumes about why new life in Jesus Christ is so vital.  It is ideal for the intellectual non-Christian who is struggling with the claims of Christ, mentally wrestling with the truth of His message and the need of salvation and new birth.  It is also helpful for the new believer to understand better his faith and his relationship with his Lord.<br /><br />Lewis here is profound, yet practical.  His words are holy, yet extremely human.  This book is actually a compilation of three separate titles by Lewis, the first of which was copyrighted in 1943.  Over the decades that have followed, his words have proven timelessly inspiring.<br /><br />For the non-Christian with intellectual questions, and for the Christian who dares to think about his faith, this classic work is a must-read.	2005-01-23

While he does a bit of stereotyping with his various labels, he effectively communicates his message of identifying the more challenging aspects of relating to numerous people around us.<br /><br />He wisely advises each of us to look within ourselves to identify each of the flaws that tend to annoy us in others.  Usually, we can find the same quirks within us that are so bothersome around us.  He then offers particular remarks on how to better handle each type of high-maintenance relationship covered.<br /><br />I only gave this book three stars because it was more entertaining than enlightening.  In other words, I could relate to the characteristics he was describing, but there wasn't a substantial amount of solid advice on how to respond to them.  This title is a quick, easy read, but for in-depth advice on any high-maintenance relationship, I would look elsewhere.  Parrott simply tries to cover too much ground here in too little pages.	2005-01-23

This title is one of several books I have read by Aubrey Malphurs.  He is, in my estimation, the best authority on church strategic planning for established, evangelical churches.  In this volume, the author gives an overview of church strategic planning, ideal for a seminary graduate beginning his first pastorate or an older pastor who is just beginning to think strategically.  To get the full scope of Malphurs' thought, the best title is \\"Advanced Strategic Planning.\\"  This work could have been entitled \\"Basic Strategic Planning\\" -- it is a good introduction to the subject.<br /><br />If you're looking for a resource person on church strategic planning, you simply can't go wrong with Malphurs.

All of these resources provide insights as to what the church should be, but fall short of training the leader of an established congregation how to get there without getting fired or destroying the fellowship in the process.  This book is one of the few, invaluable roadmaps available.<br /><br />This title is long overdue -- it addresses how leaders with heads full of new ideas and hearts full of energy can actually bring into reality the things they are envisioning for God's people.  This book is not for the church planter, but for the pastor and/or leader of an older, well-established church.

Malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches I have found to date.  In place of the term \\"advanced\\" in the title, a better word would be \\"comprehensive.\\"  Nonetheless, Malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight.<br /><br />As a pastor of twenty years, I wish this book had been available when I first started in ministry.  I hope this title is now offered in many seminaries, because its content would be a gold mine for young, soon-to-be church leaders.  Pastors, church staff members, and lay leaders, this volume is a must-have.  In my opinion, it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership.	2004-12-23

He defines core values as those unique intangibles that drive people and ministry organizations, and highlights their critical nature in planning for future undertakings.  This book elaborates upon the core values chapter found in his wider-focused title, \\"Advanced Strategic Planning:  A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders.\\"<br /><br />Discovering individual and institutional core values is an invaluable part of ministry planning, and this book offers a wealth of insight on the topic.

He only gives a passing treatment of why a worship war begins within a church body, and what can be done to diffuse it or to discourage it.<br /><br />I recommend \\"America's Worship Wars\\" by Terry York instead of this title by Towns.

I've read this book now, as well as his other titles.  I just don't see that problem with his writings.  He does speak of the depravity of man, and how Christ is our only hope.<br /><br />I admire how Eldredge takes the Christian message and makes it so culturally relevant.  He doesn't change the content of the message, only the way in which it is conveyed.  He uses life experiences with which most people can identify.  He also is obviously a movie buff, using many scenes from Hollywood classics to illustrate his points.<br /><br />Eldredge doesn't offer lofty theology, nor does he offer nuts and bolts advice on Christian living.  He falls somewhere in the middle of the two, communicating timeless spiritual truths to the heart.  I enjoy his work, and recommend it to any Christian who wants a bit of refreshment in his/her devotional life.	2004-10-09

If you want a better understanding of the man however, and the spiritual journey take has taken him to the Oval Office, then this title is a must-read.	2004-09-19

The author really doesn't tell me anything new about political conservatism, but he does bring a myriad of issues together under one cover.  Smith's writing style is entertaining and enlightening.  For people with more of a leaning to the left, this title shouldn't be seen as a piece of trash or propaganda, but as an informative description of the positions of the political right.  Although I admit to being a political conservative, I'd enjoy reading a similar volume summarizing the views of the political left!<br /><br />Among the many politically right-leaning books on the market today, this one is a must-read!	2004-09-17

While this title doesn't present itself as a classic, it does offer a different way of viewing leadership.  Woods contrasts a successful leader with a faithful leader.  The Christian's goal is to be a faithful leader, which has a biblical standard of achievement.<br /><br />If you are fairly well-read in the area of Christian leadership and are a Baptist, particularly an American Baptist, I recommend you read this work.  If you are just beginning to read on Christian leadership, there are other titles by Hybels, Malphurs and Barna that would be much better investments.	2004-09-15

He correctly identifies the players and describes the various strategies.  He falls short however, in offering a solid plan of action for Christians and others who still adhere to absolute truth.<br /><br />This book is a good, quick read for anyone wanting to get the conservative Christian's perspective on the unifying thread behind many of today's \\"hot button\\" issues.	2004-09-15

Since this book was recommended by Amazon to accompany \\"Unfit for Command,\\" I read it as well.  While I find credibility in \\"Unfit for Command,\\" this title gives a much broader scope and support base for the argument that modern Democrats are extremely soft on defense.  It describes Kerry's shortcomings, but it also goes all the way back to blunders of Kennedy and Johnson.

I must say it is well-written and provocative.  I'm disappointed with the attempts to dismiss the swift boat vets in general and this title in particular as being a smear tactic of the Republicans.  While it is an election year and mud-slinging is certainly present, the questions raised by this book merit further investigation.  Rather than crying foul over repeated questions over his war record, why doesn't Kerry just file a standard form 180 and set matters straight?

For many years, believers have been misled to separate their influence upon souls from their influence upon society.  The former has been encouraged, while the latter has been seen as undesirable.  Minnery restores the biblical and historical balance by admonishing the church today to be both salt and light in a fallen world.<br /><br />The author emphasizes that for too long the church has remained silent regarding the moral decay surrounding it.  While political involvement and social action are not the only means to make a difference, they are important means that believers have neglected in the last several decades.<br /><br />This book is a must-read for all Christians who desire to have a balanced, biblical approach to the society around them.	2004-08-20

Dobson begins by describing the present state of marriages in America.  He then gives a brief history of how we have slumped towards increasing acceptance of gay marriages.<br />The best part of this volume is the latter half.  Dobson makes several powerful, convincing arguments as to why same-sex marriages have a harmful effect on our entire society.  The author then concludes his work by prescribing how people can get involved, stopping the moral erosion and preserving the very institution of marriage itself.<br />This book is short and to-the-point.  It could easily be read in one sitting.  I recommend it highly to everyone who desires an understanding of the Christian, Biblical perspective on America's marital crisis.	2004-07-03

Taylor is hard-to-follow as he attempts to weave a web of diabolical intrigue and Divine omnipotence.  The author jumps from one character to another, leaving the reader to question exactly who is doing what to whom.<br />I give this book two stars for the good intentions.  I had hoped it was on the same literary level as Harry Potter with the addition of a clearly defined Christian theme.  The Christian theme is here, but the literary workmanship of a Rowling or a Tolkien is painfully absent.  Obviously, I was disappointed.	2004-06-28

For those of us who have abided by biblical morals, the pressure is growing to succumb to a politically correct, homosexuality-affirming agenda.  The subtitle of this volume reads, \\"Exposing the principal threat to religious freedom today.\\"  These words summarize the theme of the book.<br />Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are both in the process of being curtailed in light of the new, growing state religion of tolerance.  While many of us may not believe that American society could come to such a point, the authors present case after case to show how these freedoms are being restrained, and how if present trends continue these freedoms will be diminished even further.<br />This title is an eye-opener for Christians with a biblically-based morality and sexuality.  Get it, read it, and realize the great peril we face as believers who condemn homosexuality as a valid, alternate lifestyle.	2004-06-27

There is a lot of confusion in Christian marriages today about sex.  Most Christians resources don't give enough attention to this most physical aspect of marriage, and society has twisted it into anything but pure.  Gardner brings husbands and wives back to a Biblical standard, asserting that sex in marriage is not only special, it is sacred.<br />If you feel the term \\"sacred sex\\" is a contradiction, then you need to read this book.  This title is well worth the price for Christian husbands and wives.	2004-06-19

He encourages the church to speak, claiming that for too long the body of Christ has been silent on the decline of biblical marriage. He encourages Christians to take a fresh look at the Scriptures, allowing the Word of God to speak for itself on the subject of homosexuality in general and same-sex marriage in particular.  He also encourages the church to act now and to seek God in this moral and spiritual crisis regarding the institution of marriage.<br />Lutzer is very clear in stating that concerned Christians can and should be developing friendships with homosexuals, while at the same time working fervently to preserve biblical marriage.  The author here does not participate in any kind of bashing of homosexuals, but does assert God's standard for sexuality and for marriage.<br />If you want to bury your head in the sand and ignore the present peril of biblical marriage in our country, don't read this title.  If you are concerned however, and want more information and suggestions for speaking the truth in love, get this book.	2004-06-10

This book describes very well the shift that has occurred in American society over the past twenty or so years.  The authors correctly portray the new tolerance as a new state religion, a belief system that demands allegiance by everyone who desires to be seen as civilized and cultured.  The result is that absolute, propositional truth becomes a relic of an unenlightened past.<br />For Christians who are seeking to defend their biblical faith and values from the onslaught of relativism, this book is a must-read.

I've read several reviews on this site and at other locations that bash the Biblical integrity of this book.  After reading it from cover to cover, I like it!  I see it as true to the Scriptures, and helpful for all who read it.  Warren here presents an easy-to-read, easy-to-follow guideline for experiencing greater discipleship.<br />Granted, the purpose outline can be seen at first glance as very self-centered:  \\"YOU were planned for God's pleasure, YOU were formed for God's family, YOU were created to become like Christ, YOU were shaped for serving God, YOU were made for a mission.\\"  The point however, is that all of these statements answer the essential question \\"What on earth am I here for?\\" with GOD-CENTERED answers!<br />I recommend this title highly as a Biblical, non-technical reference to promote Christian discipleship.  Reading it with a group is much more beneficial than reading it alone.  If you haven't experienced this book yet, give it a try and see what you've been missing!	2004-06-01

I read this book when it was first published years ago, and have just finished reading it again.  After twenty years of pastoral ministry, I find the conflict stories of well-intentioned dragons to ring true with my own experience.  I can also see how the insights gained from reading this book the first time have helped me in dealing with many difficult church members I have encountered.<br />Shelley's theme is found in one of his introductory remarks:<br />&quot;The rest of this book deals with various kinds of dragons, their tactics, and the ways to handle them.  But from the beginning a premise stands clear:  the goal in handling dragons is not to destroy them, not merely to disassociate, but to make them disciples.  Even when that seems an unlikely prospect&quot; (p. 34).<br />This book is directed towards pastors, but contains helpful lessons for all church leaders.  I can't think of a better, more insightful title on church conflict.  This one is essential reading for everyone who even occasionally has to respond to conflict within a congregation.	2004-05-30

This book is the third title I have read of Christian rebuttals to &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot;  While the first two books were good, this one is the best yet.  Bock's points are clear, concise, and easy to follow.  The author here doesn't simply advance his own agenda, but instead offers a defense to the various accusations leveled against Christianity in the best-selling fictional novel.<br />Bock gives detailed attention to Mary Magdalene, a personality central to Brown's hypothesis. Bock explains logically and historically why the idea of Jesus being unmarried as a Jewish rabbi is completely acceptable. Bock then addresses the lack of credibility of the secret, Gnostic gospels.  He emphasizes that they were considered as non-authoritative long before the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325.<br />The author here also makes a few points of his own about the mindset present in &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; and why it has such a powerful appeal to today's society.  If you want to read just one book to provide a scholarly, Christian rebuttal, this title is it.  The insight contained in these pages is well worth the price.	2004-05-21

While his theology is flawed Scripturally, I must admit his series of &quot;Left Behind&quot; books has inspired millions to give more serious thought to the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Because God has used these works so powerfully, I've read each of them.<br />The title of this work is self-explanatory for anyone who has read at least one of the other Left Behind titles.  Although Glorious Appearing is deemed to be the last in a highly popular, highly lucrative series, the epilogue leaves open the possibility of a sequel being published sometime in the future.<br />Whether or not you agree with LaHaye's stance, these books have been a phenomenon in the secular marketplace.  I recommend that all believers in general, and pastors in particular, read them.  While we may disagree on the particulars, Jesus Christ IS returning in bodily fashion.  These books, especially this last one in the series, focus attention on that reality.	2004-04-03

His depth and breadth are more extensive than any author I have read previously.  This work is divided into three sections:  the reality of church abuse, ministers whose personalities and/or disorders bring pain upon themselves, and ways to recover and to heal.<br />For me as a pastor, the best portions of the book were the last two sections.  Most ministers are aware of the horror stories of clergy being abused by their churches, but far less are aware of traits in their own lives that increase the probability of injury.  Also, few ministers who are wounded are aware of the many ways that healing and recovery can occur.<br />This volume is a must-read for any pastor or associate pastor.  If he hasn't experienced yet the heartache of ministry, I am convinced it is not matter of when it comes, but how intensely it comes.  This book will help a minister in caring for himself and in supporting colleagues who have been wounded in their service.	2004-02-22

Throughout his other works, Malphurs demonstrates that he has an excellent grasp on principles essential to Christian leadership.

What is refreshing is the fresh way he communicates those principles.  My favorite aspect of this work is the servant-sayings scattered throughout the pages.  For example, the author remarks, &quot;You will never become a servant leader until you first become a servant to the Leader.&quot;  Another excerpt says, &quot;You are not the leader until the group you are leading says so.&quot;  A third quote reads, &quot;Servant leaders humble themselves and wait for God to exalt them.&quot;<br />This book was highly recommended to me, and I in turn recommend it to all Christian leaders.	2004-01-31

This book is the second one I have read by Aubrey Malphurs.  The first one dealt with values-driven leadership in general, this one focuses on the role of the pastor in particular.  His comments in both volumes are insightful and inspirational.<br />The most memorable point Malphurs makes is that the primary job of a shepherd is not just to love, but to lead.  He refutes the popular notion that being a shepherd of God's people implies focusing on the ministry of pastoral care.  While pastoral care should not be neglected, the biblical truth is that the shepherds primarily lead.  Getting back to this scriptural pattern will empower the church to be a more effective, transforming force in the world today.<br />Malphurs' work is always top-notch.  He is profound, yet not difficult to follow.  He is deep, but never bogged down.  I recommend this work highly to all Christian pastors.	2003-12-27

This title was recommended to me by a friend who is a PRP (Professional Registered Parliamentarian).  I've read a number of books on RONR (Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised), but this is the first one that applies specifically to churches.  Too many congregations dictate that RONR are their authority on conducting business meetings, but have little or no understanding of what RONR actually say and mean.  Having served as a pastor for over twenty years, I have witnessed (and contributed to) church business meetings being sloppily conducted because of a lack of familiarity with RONR.  McCarthy here provides some very helpful pointers for all church leaders in general, and for church moderators in particular.<br />I recommend this book highly to church leaders and moderators, along with two other &quot;must-have&quot; titles.  McCarthy should be read as a follow-up to &quot;Robert's Rules of Order in Plain English&quot; by Doris P. Zimmerman.  Zimmerman's work provides the best summary of RONR I have read to date.  McCarthy can then be used to build upon that summary with a specific application to churches.  Of course the latest edition of RONR itself should always be on hand as the third &quot;must have&quot; title, since it is the actual and final authority.	2003-12-25

This book is a very realistic volume about the dangers present on the Internet, and what just about anyone can do to be safer.  The author begins by describing her own experience with being stalked online then offline.  The impact of her story is that this kind of thing CAN and DOES happen.<br />Hitchcock then begins moving through a variety of online dangers, from stalking to spoofing to scamming.  Each danger she describes is very much present.  Her words should not be taken lightly by a reader with little or no experience with the Internet.<br />The best pointer I received from this book was the lack of security in email.  The author describes email more as a postcard than a letter written and sealed in an envelope.  Since I write many emails and sometimes address sensitive ministerial issues, I have begun using and promoting free encryption and digital signature software.<br />For people who spend any amount of time online, whether it be email, chat or shopping, this book is a MUST.  It is one of the best summaries of online hazards I have read.  This one is well worth the price!	2003-12-18

He does a good, thorough job of addressing the flaws of the extremely popular dispensational premillennialism (&quot;Left Behind&quot; theology).  He avoids excessive use of technical jargon, and is easy to follow.<br />Waldron here, contrary to what many people may think of amillennialists, is very emphatic about the Bible being God's inerrant, inspired Word.  He uses a simple approach to interpreting the Scriptures' stand on the end times -- start with the clear, literal passages as a basis, then build upon them with the less clear, figurative passages.  He provides a several diagrams to make his views even easier to grasp.<br />This title is an excellent alternative to the &quot;Left Behind&quot; theology so prominent today.  I recommend it highly.	2003-11-21

I frankly was disappointed with lack of applicable content.  He does address pastors directly, but he seems to ramble when he could be making one point after another.  Most pastors will find something in his words of value.  I did.  For the nuggets of truth this book does contain, I give it three stars.  Still, Peterson seems to be capable of doing so much better.<br />There is no doubt that Peterson is a man of God who has a message for the people of this age.  I just sensed that the &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; was garbled somewhere between the prophet and the written proclamation.  For the money, this title is a good, but not great, read for pastors and other church leaders.	2003-11-16

There IS a growing persecution of Christianity today, stemming from the popular notion that there is no such thing as absolute truth.  The author again and again illustrates dramatically that Christians are under fire along many fronts in our American society.<br />As I moved through the book, I kept thinking, \\"Yes, I agree, America IS biased against Christianity and HAS departed from her Christian foundations.  Now what can I DO to reverse the trend?\\"  Limbaugh offers a few tidbits of insight in his closing pages, but not nearly enough for the believer who wants to make a difference in the world of the 21st century.<br />I would have given this title five stars, but the lack of any direction and course of action diminishes the power of the message.  Perhaps Limbaugh could write a follow-up that describes the cures available to concerned American citizens.  This book makes it clear there is a problem -- now let's have a sequel that provides a plan.	2003-11-15

It is tempting to get so bogged down in the particular rules of procedure that the underlying principles of order and efficiency for the assembly are overlooked.<br />The author says in the opening portion of her book, &quot;Parliamentary procedure should be used to help and not hinder decision making.  Robert said, 'The assembly meets to transact business, not to have members exploit their knowledge of parliamentary law.'&quot; (p. 6).<br />I recommend reading this work first, then referring to the full volume of Robert's Rules if more detail is needed.  For most people however, this work should be all that is required to possess a working knowledge of parliamentary procedure.  As a Baptist pastor, I see this book as being particularly helpful to church leaders and members for their participation in business meetings, board meetings, and other decision-making assemblies.  The knowledge contained in this volume is well-worth the price!	2003-11-13

I am beginning to understand why he is seen as such a classic apologist.  His principle is timeless -- one's pre-suppositions and worldview must begin with the truth of the Scriptures.  He shows why other systems of thought are flawed, in that they do not have their foundation on the Word of God.<br />While his principle here, profoundly stated, is timeless, his presentation is tiring.  This book is hard to read and to follow.  Perhaps if Van Til's work had been more recent his presentation would have been easier to digest.<br />Van Til also makes his point by focusing on Arminians and Catholic thought systems, rather than on secular thought systems.  The author gives the impression that he is defending his own reformed position, rather than defending historic, biblical Christianity.  While he IS defending the Christian faith, using a wider variety of examples would have made defense clearer and more compelling.<br />This book is NOT for the faint of heart.  Van Til is a deep thinker and a dogmatic, reformed theologian.  I recommend it only to those people who have a strong interest in apologetics in general or in Van Til in particular.	2003-10-26

I don't see it as persuasive however, for unbelievers.  It offers valuable tools for believers in their interactions with people who have not yet followed Jesus, but by itself it has little to offer critics of Christianity.<br />Strobel examines the record of the biblical account of Jesus, the person of Jesus himself, and the Resurrection of Jesus.  He interviews various experts who all add intellectual support to the truth that Jesus is the Son of God, and that Christianity is based upon absolute truth.  These arguments themselves however, will do little to reach most skeptical non-believers.<br />This book is an excellent tool for Christians who are building loving relationships with non-Christians.  In the context of that relationship, a believer can use this volume as a resource in responding to objections raised regarding the Christian faith.  Don't just hand this title to a non-believer -- use it as a reference in personally, lovingly leading that individual to Christ.	2003-10-25

Having now finished it, I must say I am a little disappointed with the content.  I expected profound and striking ideas.  In these pages however, were no new principles I have not already learned.<br />The smallness of Baxter's content however, is far exceeded by the substance of his character.  It is his character, his pastoral passion for ministry that makes this book the classic it has become.  His single-minded devotion to God and his tender, shepherd's heart for his flock have inspired pastors for over 300 years.<br />This book is not an easy read.  The English language has changed substantially over 300 years, and as a result the essence of Baxter's pastoral passion is undoubtedly distorted.  Still, this volume IS a classic, and is a must-read for any pastor wanting to refine and/or restore his motivation for ministry.	2003-10-19

I have exercised regularly for years, and am well-acquainted with the benefits of aerobic conditioning.  Although I have been aware of the importance of proper heart rate, I've always just guessed at it.  On my last visit to my physician, he suggested that I exercise using a heart rate monitor.  Sally Edwards' book was the one I chose to inform me on heart rate training.<br />This book presents the basics of heart zone training, which are exactly what I need as a beginner.  A more experienced heart rate trainer might find the volume too simplistic, but for a novice it is ideal. Edwards' work is easy-to-read, and the training stories of friends and acquaintances personalize the presentation.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who is considering a heart rate training program.  It's basic, it's believable, and it's built upon solid medical and athletic experience.  Once you've read this title, you'll want to buy a heart rate monitor immediately.  Take your time, learn about features and prices, and then purchase accordingly. The appendix at the back of the book gives some good advice on how to select a monitor that is right for you.	2003-10-01

This book could have also been entitled &quot;Theology for Dummies,&quot; and I say that as a great compliment.  Having received seven years of seminary training, I have waded through my fair share of deep, hard-to-read theological works.  From Emil Brunner to Dale Moody, I have covered a spectrum of authors.  I cannot remember one of those theological titles that I would recommend to the average church member in my congregation.<br />This work however, I recommend wholeheartedly.  People in our churches today are starving for straightforward, biblically based, easy-to-read theology.  Jeffery here speaks to the layperson as he outlines key doctrines of the Christian faith.  Among the doctrines explained are:  God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the Trinity, Sin, Grace, Regeneration, Justification, Sanctification, and the Second Coming.  I'm recommending this book to my church librarian as an addition to the materials available to our congregation.  It is simply a superb primer on Christian theology!	2003-09-29

I began reading this book on shepherding rather skeptically, thinking it would denounce church growth concepts and advocate a return to ineffective methodologies of a by-gone era.  Instead, what I found was a very helpful, relevant and insightful work that offers practical tips for the 21st century pastor.  Stowell divides his book into four sections:  perspective, personhood, proclamation and proficiency.<br />When I first entered the pastoral ministry 20 years ago, I was given the classic book &quot;Lectures to My Students&quot; by Charles Spurgeon.  I've read many titles in that time period, and hadn't found another one in its league until I read this one by Stowell.  Buy it, read it, and see for yourself!	2003-09-28

In a scholarly yet straightforward manner, the author presents nuggets of truth that will enrich the prayer lives of his readers.  While I appreciated his exposition of numerous New Testament passages, his most helpful remarks were practical instructions based on his own spiritual development.  Chapter one, for example, offers many useful lessons from the school of prayer.  Chapter four emphasizes the necessity of praying for others.  Chapter seven examines common excuses for not praying.<br />This book is directed towards the more educated reader or the trained Christian leader.  It is somewhat wordy in spots, and drags a bit in its pace.  Still, Carson presents solid, spiritual, Scriptural advice that will strengthen the prayer life of each person who reads his work.	2003-09-20

He encourages readers to get a better understanding of today's society, emphasizing that we as a church can't provide Biblical answers if we don't take time to listen to the questions.  The author stays true to his title and draws outside the lines to explore new means of bringing people to Christ.<br />Some people may misunderstand this book, thinking that Richardson is forsaking the time-honored gospel by substituting church growth gimmicks and man-made strategies.  Actually Richardson is very conservative in his theology, but very progressive in his methodology.  Unless the reader distinguishes between the two, he/she will have a difficult time benefiting from this work.<br />I recommend this book to all believers, especially church leaders, who are looking for new ways to cultivate relationships with the lost and to bring them to salvation in Christ.	2003-09-19

Susek in this volume provides a simply excellent treatment of the vicious, destructive nature of church conflict.  In the first part of his work he gives the account of an actual church, describing how the sparks of conflict were scattered, the flames were fanned, and the fierce firestorm was unleashed.  While Susek's example is extreme for many churches struggling with lesser issues, the escalation of conflict is basically the same regardless of the scale.<br />In the second part of his book Susek addresses the various causes of a church firestorm.  The third portion offers practical instruction on getting a firestorm under control.  The fourth and final section gives suggestions on binding the wounds of the various parties who have been burned by the conflict.<br />I recommend this title to all pastors.  For most of us, it is not a matter of IF we encounter a firestorm in our ministry, but WHEN we will experience one.  I also see this book as being very helpful for church leaders who are dealing with conflict situations, regardless of their severity.  Susek's work here is well-worth the price, offering healing and hopes for the conflict-scorched congregation.	2003-09-05

Books	2	8	14	N	N	Short on Scripture, Simplistic on Shepherding	As a pastor of twenty years and a student of church health, I was disappointed with this volume.  Obviously the author has been burned by the abuse of church growth/health principles, and now swings the pendulum in excess to the opposite direction.  He makes a sharp distinction between pastors who use a shepherding model and pastors who use a corporate model.  The idea that the two both may be used together apparently never occurs to him.<br />Wagner hammers again and again on his point that the people of God throughout the Bible are depicted as a diverse flock with the pastor as the shepherd.  Each sheep is in need of one-on-one ministry.  He is certainly correct, but he omits Paul's analogy of the people of God as one body.  Wagner gives no attention here to the corporate (gasp) need of the body, or of the flock as a whole, to receive loving care and nurture.<br />With all of its shortcomings, I still give this book two stars because it provides a good critique of church growth/health principles.  It also emphasizes something modern pastors must never forget:  according to God's Word, we ARE undershepherds to the great Shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ.	2003-09-02

There was no meaty theological discussion, just basic, almost simplistic spirituality.  Then it occurred to me that as pastors we tend to get so busy and so preoccupied with the &quot;meaty&quot; theological matters and the more &quot;advanced&quot; spiritual issues that we lose touch with the fundamentals.  Here Peterson offers pastors a slower, change-of-pace that is refreshing and renewing.<br />I especially appreciated his chapter entitled &quot;The Ministry of Small Talk.&quot;  There is a place in our busy lives as ministers to discuss more trivial things with other people.  Through spending time conversing about smaller issues, we can make larger strides in relationships.<br />This book is the first one I have read by Peterson.  I don't plan for it to be the last.  If you are a busy, burdened pastor, it will do you good to read this insightful work.	2003-09-01

This book, more than any other I have read to date, describes the changes that must take place as youth ministry enters the 21st century. The authors focus upon the necessity of having spiritual, youth relationships rather than just social, youth recreation.  The crying need today is for churches to minister as only they can do to the emptiness young people face in their lives. Rather than competing with secular programming, Christian youth ministries are called to offer something entirely different from the secular world.<br />The authors describe in detail various measures to be taken that will energize youth in their Christian faith.  This title is far from a book of programming ideas, but rather a very readable volume of philosophy and theology on youth ministry.  I recommend it highly to all youth pastors, and other Christian professionals who will interact with teenagers on a regular basis.	2003-07-15

While this book gives good advice on how to rest in God's grace, it still does not equal the intensity of his best-selling work \\"Classic Christianity.\\"  George continues his strong emphasis upon the believer's ability to rely upon and to rest within God's grace rather than striving and struggling in the Christian life.<br />This work, like all his others, is very readable and easy to understand.  The reader must keep in mind however, that George is speaking as a counselor, not a theologian.  He is also coming from a background of having struggled with legalism, and having counseled with many Christians who had the same struggle.  At times George overstates his case, possibly to jolt any readers struggling with legalism into a new understanding of a life dependent upon the grace of God.<br />At this point, the only book by George I can strongly recommend is \\"Classic Christianity.\\"  Once the reader has grasped the truths it presents, the need for this volume decreases.  There are many other books on the market that do a much better job of enhancing spiritual maturity than this one.	2003-07-04

Rather than starting with the timeless truths however, McGee begins with the problems we experience because of our lack of those truths.  He then works his way back to the theological principles that will set us free from the ills we face.<br />For example, he describes how many of us believe we must meet certain high standards in order to feel we are of worth.  God's truth is that we have been made faultless in Christ, that we have been justified.  In other words, in God's eyes we have met the perfect standard through our relationship with Jesus.<br />Another point McGee makes is that many of us feel shame, believing we are nothing but hopeless cases unable to change.  God's truth is that we have been regenerated as new individuals.  In other words, if anyone is in Christ the old passed away, and the new just keeps on coming!<br />After reading this book, I have an even greater appreciation for the new life I have as a believer.  McGee presents a volume that sheds much light on who Christians are because of their relationship with Jesus.  I recommend this title highly.	2003-06-28

After reading &quot;Faith that Pleases God&quot; and being disappointed, I wanted to read his best-selling work.  Now I understand why so many people have shown interest in this particular author.<br />George addresses a problem that is all too prevalent in Christian circles today:  legalism.  Far too many people have found salvation through faith in Christ alone, only to be enslaved by a long list of religious duties and spiritual obligations.  George brings his readers back to the Scriptural basics here.  He repeatedly makes the point that God saves us and KEEPS us saved through grace alone.<br />I recommend this book highly to all Christians, especially those believers from conservative or fundamentalist backgrounds.  George proclaims God's Biblical truth about salvation and sanctification.  In doing so, he sets his readers free.	2003-06-19

I've read several books by John Maxwell, each one of which has been excellent.  This latest read is no exception.  Maxwell offers 15 steps here of how to make the best of failure.  He emphasizes early in his work that the cardinal principle underlying all of these steps -- one must refuse to think of himself as a failure even though he may fail repeatedly.<br />Using the failures of notable, successful personalities, Maxwell illustrates each one of his steps.  Among the most well-known personalities are:  Mary Kay, Truett Cathy, Erma Bombeck, the Wright Brothers, Arnold Palmer, and R.H. Macy.  Throughout the book the author is entertaining and easy-to-read, yet profound and thought-provoking.<br />Anyone in leadership will be a better leader for having read this title.  &quot;Everything rises and falls on leadership,&quot; Maxwell says in another one of his works, and there is nothing like responding properly to failure to refine it.  With this book the author has proven once again his leadership expertise, expertise that pays both sacred and secular dividends.	2003-06-13

The six traits he offers are:  a dislocated heart, a broken spirit, a radical faith, a strategic plan, a personal commitment, and a courageous soul.<br />Ingram weaves Scriptural passages together with his own experience to provide support and illustration for each characteristic he names.  For the Christian reader who has digested numerous books on increasing devotion, there won't be any startling revelations here or radical insights. Instead, the value of Ingram's work is that he gathers together widely known Biblical passages on spirituality and organizes them in an easy-to-follow manner.	2003-06-09

Before moving to this book's greatest shortcoming, I'd like to mention its greatest strength.  George here gives a very strong message of God's grace for the believer in Christ.  For people who have been struggling with a legalistic view of Christianity, his words are like a deep drink of cool water to parched and thirsty lips.  There are many Christians who will benefit enormously from his emphasis on the centrality of God's grace in the life of one who is born again.<br />The greatest shortcoming of this work is that it has little if any regard for church history and theology.  In the opening pages, George describes the message he felt God was impressing upon him early in his Christian development:<br />&quot;'Bob, your mind is like a blackboard covered with all sorts of religious information. . . .  Bob, today let's erase the whole thing and start over.  I don't care what the Baptists or what Campus Crusade has taught you, or your pastor, relative or friend.  I want you to erase it all and start over again, allowing Me to teach you.  Are you willing?'  I answered, 'Lord, am I ever!'  'Good,' God said, 'Now, open your Bible.'  As I did, over the course of the next several months, God began to teach me the fullness of His grace -- starting with the very basics.&quot; (Pages 30-31)<br />The rest of this work describes the garbled view of grace that George learned in his private, exclusive tutoring from God.  Because he places a high priority on the integrity of the Scriptures, the bulk of what he says rings true.  He loses however, the clarity and consistency that would have resulted from openness to the Biblical theology and teaching from other believers. Three examples of this deficiency are his shallow remarks on sanctification (mainly forgiveness of sin), intercessory prayer, and predestination.<br />In short, George's work has a very powerful, positive psychological effect on someone who has experienced little of God's grace.  Theologically however, his words are sorely lacking in the clarity and the consistency that learning from other believers throughout church history would have provided.  The danger is that uninformed Christians who read his book will follow in the same footsteps of his isolated spiritual development.<br />For all the people choosing to read this book, it would be wise to remember that George is writing as a Christian counselor, not as a theologian. To develop any sort of doctrinal system based upon these views would be very risky business for believers.tle of God's grace.

It covers the basics such as regeneration, joy, temptation, Christian conduct, Bible study, prayer, sharing one's faith, life direction, and worldliness.  These topics would make good material for a study group of people new to the Christian faith.<br />I would have given this work five stars, but the format is poor.  The Scriptures used are given in their entirety at the end of each chapter, and are difficult to distinguish from the rest of the text.  Had Scripture references only been cited within the text, the book would have been much better.  Study questions would also have improved this book's usefulness.  Still, this book is a great resource to offer to a person who has just been born again into the kingdom of God.	2003-05-29

Berkley.  Various church leaders give their input on a vast array of topics related to church management and administration.  Had I known a reference work of this scope was available, I would have purchased it when initially published.<br />This work is divided into seven parts:  personal management, transitions, leadership, paid-staff supervision, volunteer-staff supervision, management, and finances.  Contributing authors include:  Leith Anderson, Peter Drucker, Jack Hayford, Aubrey Malphurs, Joseph Stowell, and Chuck Swindoll.  Each part of this volume is filled with words of wisdom from men and women who excel in their fields.<br />I highly recommend this book, and the two other volumes in the series, for all experienced and inexperienced church staff members. There is something here for everyone that will help in working with the various nuts and bolts of ministry.  I know of no other title that compares to scope and excellence found here.	2003-05-27

Every Christian needs at least two Bibles versions, one for study and one for reading.  While the New International Version is still the best choice for study, The Message is now the best choice for devotional reading. It belongs on every believer's bookshelf.<br />The Message is not a translation, but a paraphrase.  A paraphrase is not as accurate as a translation, but is much easier to read and to understand.  The Living Bible is a tremendously popular paraphrase of the past.  After decades of use however, it has become dated and is now difficult to find. The Message is clearly its successor for the English-speaking church.<br />With the plethora of study Bibles on the market today, it is easy to get lost in all of the notes, graphs, charts and other helps.  As a result, one can lose the joy of just READING the Bible.  Study Bibles with all their helps play an important role, but for simply reading God's Word devotionally &quot;The Message&quot; is by far the best choice.	2003-05-24

His book is also on mentoring, and is far superior to this one.  This volume seems to come more from the standpoint of a mentoring enthusiast rather than a saint who is set on building godly, life-transforming relationships with members of the same sex.<br />While overusing the term \\"mentoring,\\" Biehl does give some very helpful points for developing a mentoring program in the local church.  Rather than appointing mentors to prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, he suggests developing lists of persons willing to serve in each capacity.  Personal chemistry and mutual attraction then would work to bring the two together.<br />Hendricks work is much stronger in its treatment of mentoring.  I recommend it as a first choice in learning more about this important, long-neglected biblical practice.	2003-05-09

This book was originally published under the title &quot;The One Minute Manager Gets Fit.&quot;  An even better title would have been &quot;The One Minute Manager Takes Care of Himself.&quot;  The entire volume emphasizes the importance of taking of oneself so that effectiveness in all other areas of life will be at a maximum.<br />There are four components presented here to insure a fit, healthy life:  autonomy, connectedness, perspective and tone.  Autonomy pertains to getting control of one's personal schedule so that there is enough time for self-care.  Connectedness refers to having a strong, interpersonal support network to keep on track with proper fitness, nutrition, etc.  Perspective pertains to how well one views his own life.  Tone refers to the actual physical condition and health of a person's body, mind and emotions.<br />This title should be at the top of the list for &quot;One Minute&quot; fans.  The format is the same as all the other books in the series and the principles are life-changing.  For some persons, this book may even be life-saving!	2003-04-26

I thoroughly enjoy reading John Maxwell's works, and this latest volume is no exception.  He opens in his first three chapters with a presentation of why it is important to use good thought processes.  He then proceeds in the main body of the book to describe eleven cognitive skills every person should possess:  big-picture thinking, focused thinking, creative thinking, realistic thinking, strategic thinking, possibility thinking, reflective thinking, critical thinking, shared thinking, unselfish thinking, and bottom-line thinking.<br />While Maxwell has written at least one previous book on attitude, this work pertains to attitude and goes further to address effective patterns of reasoning.  I personally appreciate the author's Christian perspective, although non-Christians could benefit by much if not all of what he has to share.<br />Maxwell is tops when it comes to cultivating leadership skills.  Anyone in a management/leadership position would do well to read this one.  Get it and see if you think the same!	2003-04-26

In this book, he does a superb job of presenting the tremendous worth and transforming power of a mentoring relationship between two men.  While these principles would also apply to a woman-to-woman relationship, Hendricks is writing to provide support for the Christian men's movement &quot;Promise Keepers.&quot;<br />There are two sections to this work:  how to find a mentor, and how to be a mentor.  Hendricks emphasizes there are many more men seeking mentors than there are men who are willing to be mentors.  He discourages actually using the title of &quot;mentor&quot; when establishing such a supportive relationship, for fear it will intimate one of the parties.  Instead, he promotes referring to the interaction as what would occur between two friends.  Hendricks also describes how to spot a mentor or a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, then how to avoid common pitfalls of such an arrangement.<br />For anyone seeking to learn from a respected male friend, or for someone seeking to invest his life-lessons of experience in a younger man, this book is simply invaluable.	2003-04-26

This title is the first one I have read by Dr. Kevin Leman.  I am so impressed with him and his humorous, helpful style that he will likely be on my list of favorite authors.  Leman's personality comes through strong in this volume about married life, laughter, and the language of love.<br />I read this book first, and then my wife was so intrigued by my interest that she read it as well.  My wife is normally not a reader of non-fiction, but this title held her attention to the very end.  Both of us later described this volume by remarking, \\"This guy is so right on target with his description of what makes men/women tick!\\"<br />Leman is a devout Christian, and as such remains within biblical guidelines in his sexual advice.  He definitely is NOT however, puritanical by any means.  He describes sex in marriage as a gift from God to be thoroughly enjoyed, not as a necessary evil to be endured.<br />For years as a pastor I've recommended one other particular title to newlyweds as an \\"all-you-wanted-to-know-about-sex-but-was-afraid-to-ask\\" book.  I am so impressed that this title will now replace it.  Buy it for your marriage, read it in your marriage, and learn even more about this wondrous gift God has provided!	2003-04-26

This one is easy-to-read yet intellectually respectable.  His stated goal is to be down-to-earth and concise, and he achieves it.<br />Green addresses such common themes as:<br />&quot;It doesn't matter what you believe as long are you are sincere.&quot;<br />&quot;Aren't all religions pretty much the same?&quot;<br />&quot;But surely all religions lead to God?&quot;<br />&quot;What makes Jesus so special, then?&quot;<br />After replying to these themes, Green makes a solid case for the uniqueness of the Christian faith in general, and Jesus in particular.

McIntosh offers an excellent overview of the rationale for having more than one staff person, and the pitfalls to avoid in hiring additional staff.  For anyone leading a church from a single staff to multi-staff ministry, this book is not one to miss.  The graphs and tables he offers are particularly insightful.<br />When I purchased this book, I was looking for an aid to keep a multi-staff church moving smoothly, not something to start it effectively.  McIntosh's work is very weak in the help it offers to senior pastors who are looking for insights into better leadership of existing staff.

His depiction of the results with the Father's children is sickeningly sweet and overly dramatic, but he makes his point.<br />For any father who has read \\"The One Minute Manager,\\" I encourage him to read this book also.

Once the reader grows accustomed to the parable presentation, the principles are much easier to grasp.  The author in this volume interestingly defines selfishness as neglect of self.<br />There are three basic concepts promoted:  take care of me, take care of others, and take care of the relationship I have with others.  Johnson asserts that a person is most loving when his own needs have been adequately addressed.  He feels that self-denial is destructive to ourselves and others, rather than helpful.<br />Jesus encourages us to &quot;love others as we love ourselves.&quot;  Based upon this admonition, there is a biblical basis for what the author is stating.  Until we love ourselves and give attention to our own needs and desires, we are not truly free to love.  Once we have taken &quot;one minute&quot; to look inward and assess our own needs, then we are much better equipped to relate to the persons around us.<br />This book is an easy read -- I finished it in one sitting.  If you have been raised to think that self-denial is always good and self-indulgence is always bad, I encourage you to read this volume.  For the price, the insights gained are well worth the money spent.	2003-01-31

Three lessons are given to managers:  the one-minute goal, the one-minute praising, and the one-minute reprimand.  The material is presented in a parable-like format, which makes the concepts even easier to grasp.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

The author offers various thoughts and insights into what makes a great leader.  Many of these lessons he has learned through his own &quot;school of hard knocks&quot; at Willow.<br />I recommend this book very highly to all pastors, regardless of church size or denomination.

What I found was a lengthy parable about a Christian businessman re-evaluating his life with the help of a seasoned minister and a leadership professor.<br />This book is an easy read -- I finished it in just a couple of sittings.  Technical leadership jargon and sociological statistics aren't present in this volume, and their absence is a welcome relief for busy executives.  The entire concept of merging spiritual principles with management principles is an excellent one.  I also enjoyed the comradery depicted among the three men -- it serves as an inspiration for Christian men to seek and to find accountability partners from whom they can learn and grow.<br />I recommend this book to all Christian leaders, whether their vocation is in the church, the university, or the business world.

I am eager to his latest release, &quot;Love Beyond Reason.&quot;<br />Perhaps the best way to describe this book is to parallel it to Dallas Willard's classic work on spiritual formation.  Willard's writing is profound and powerful, yet is often difficult for an average layperson to follow.  Ortberg comments in his preface, &quot;...one of my private working titles for this book was 'Dallas for Dummies'.&quot;<br />The author here introduces the concept of spiritual disciplines. He then describes several disciples in easy-to-understand, entertaining language.  Ortberg includes the practices of celebration, slowing, prayer, servanthood, confession, guidance from the Holy Spirit, secrecy, and reflection on Scripture.  He concludes with comments on a well-ordered heart and the importance of Christian endurance.<br />This book is simply excellent.

It is not technical, but it is very profound and deep.  Based upon other reading I have done, it provides a good, basic description of the &quot;shadow&quot; concept.<br />This work does not follow a rational progression of thought.  Instead, it strikes a chord of common humanity deep within the heart of the reader.  It promotes inward reflection and self-evaluation.<br />I would only recommend this book to other Christian leaders who want to learn more about the psychologist's concept of the shadow.  As a non-Christian work, it offers no lasting solutions to the human dilemma.  It provides only a greater understanding of and sympathy for that dilemma.	2003-01-12

I started reading this book thinking it was primarily directed only to &quot;Neanderthal&quot; Christian men who don't have a heart or a brain when it comes to interaction with their wives!  The pace does begin slowly, but in hindsight this pace would be helpful to those men who need to start at square one in their relationships.  There is much here however, that will refine happily-married Christian men who have been living with contented spouses for years.<br />The author starts by describing how marriages grow cold.  He then progresses to offer his instructions on how to return the warm glow to the grey embers.  The bulk of the book focuses on the concept of being a bondservant to one's wife, both in heart and in mind.  This concept really makes the book, and the author's exposition of it is well worth the purchase price.  The volume concludes with a description of how submitting to one's wife, and her needs, can totally revive and rejuvenate an ailing marriage.<br />I recommend this book to all Christian married men, regardless of the strength or the longevity of their marriages.  After all, none of us as husbands have arrived!  Get it, read it, practice it, and see the difference!	2003-01-08
US	51277212	RQU5RQLH7IZB3	080546297X	261477937	The Power of the Call	Books	2	7	7	N	N	Don't Buy This Book Because of Its Cover!	I must say I was disappointed after reading this book.  I have seen my own life and the lives of many church members transformed by Blackaby's &quot;Experiencing God&quot; material.  Based upon the book jacket comments, I had hoped this volume would have similar significance for pastors particularly.  I was mistaken.<br />First, the majority of this work is written not by Henry Blackaby, but by Henry Brandt.  Blackaby follows Brandt's chapters, giving his own thoughts on the material Brandt has covered.  Brandt is solid biblically and theologically, but he simply isn't Blackaby.<br />Second, the title of this book is misleading -- &quot;God's Standards for Christian Leaders&quot; would have been much more accurate.  There are four sections presented by Brandt and Blackaby:  God's standard for your calling, God's standard for your message, God's standard for your heart, and God's standard for your ministry.<br />Third, this volume does NOT focus upon the unique calling and experience of pastors.  The book jacket states, &quot;God Himself is the power in the pastor and the Christian leader's call!  Pastors spend their days -- and often their nights -- ministering to others.  But who ministers to pastors?  God does!&quot;  The sections listed in the previous paragraph of this review are addressed to Christian leaders in general, not pastors in particular.  While a few comments are made that focus on pastors, the vast majority of the content could apply to anyone serving in a Christian ministry.<br />This book isn't bad; it is just entirely different than the work described on its jacket.  If you want a book written by Henry Brandt describing God's standards for Christian leaders in general, with comments interjected by Henry Blackaby, then buy this one.  If you want a volume directed specifically to pastors describing the power of God's call to ministry, then look elsewhere.	2003-01-04

I have been fascinated by the concept of this classic work of Stevenson for years, but never took time to read it until now.  It is a very quick, easy read, more like a short story than an actual novel.  Some persons have misunderstood this book as a detective mystery rather than a psychological reflection upon the dual natures residing within every person.  Stevenson here strikes a chord within us all by illustrating the potential darkness and evil of even the most exemplary of individuals.<br />The introduction by Vladimir Nabokov, included with this version, is best read after the story itself.  Nabokov's analysis is difficult to follow if the reader is not acquainted with the details of the plot.  He provides valuable, thought-provoking insights into what Stevenson has accomplished in this timeless tale.<br />I strongly recommend this classic to pastors, psychologists, and other persons who are interested in learning more about the struggle between good and evil within each human being.	2003-01-01

It is easy to read, but profound in nature. Many Christians may be inclined to miss the impact of this book because of its simplicity.<br />Moore here does not seek to be informative, but inspiring. There are many other volumes on the market that offer much better insight into the darkness of human nature. If a person is desiring that sort of deeper understanding, then this book is not the one to purchase. If a person is looking to find motivation to overcome his/her darker side however, then this title is the one to choose.<br />Moore divides her work into three basic sections: the Warning, the Watchman, and the Way Home. The Warning section describes the attacks Satan makes against devout believers. The Watchman section unfolds ways in which a disciple's defenses can be strengthened to resist such attacks. The Way Home section, as the title implies, points Christians in the right direction to recover from having succumbed to temptation and seduction from the Enemy.<br />I recommend this book highly to persons who are intent upon living consecrated, victorious lives for Jesus Christ. Moore's honesty, transparency and humility serve only to strengthen the arguments she presents. This one is not a book to miss!	2002-12-21

I don't normally read fiction, but this book has been getting so much press that I decided to explore it for myself.  After the first few pages I was spell-bound -- I could hardly put the thing down!  Rosenberg has a smash hit on his hands, and I, like many other readers, am eager to read a sequel.<br />This work could be described as a combination of a Tom Clancy novel and a Jenkins/LaHaye &quot;Left Behind&quot; volume.  Global crises, military action, political intrigue, compelling characters, and a conservative, Christian mindset are all present in this book.  The Christian aspect by no means dominates, but as a Baptist minister I quickly noticed the two or three times it surfaced and was pleasantly surprised.<br />Perhaps the most appealing characteristic of this fictional, future tale is its closeness to present-day reality.  With the current war on terrorism, the escalation of tension between the United States and Iraq, and the development of military and communications technology, the scenario described here could very well happen.<br />I recommend this book very highly to anyone enjoying a good fictional read.  The narrative consistently moves along at a rapid pace, never once dragging.  Order it, read it, and see for yourself!	2002-12-11

This book is the first I have read that addresses the challenges of the interpersonal relationship between a grown child and an emotionally-draining parent.  All the other books have dealt with the physical ailments of aging, or the individual challenge of being a caregiver.<br />The authors address several different types of interaction between a grown child and parent that are common today.  Any reader frustrated with a difficult parent will find some area of this volume to which he can relate.  The authors are quick to emphasize that since parents can't be made to change, the only hope for improving the relational situation is in changing as grown children.<br />Role-playing is frequently used to illustrate \\"before\\" behavior, then to illustrate \\"after\\" behavior as a result of using the specific principle suggested.  The authors also encourage developing a mental strategy that plans ahead for confrontational situations.  By identifying certain phrases and comments that trigger stress, the grown child can redirect the conversation and move it in a healthier direction for both parties.<br />This book does not address responding to serious diseases with parents, the decision of a nursing home, or major financial frustrations.  It does deal with the constant irritation that can and often does develop between an aging parent and a grown child.  I recommend it highly to all persons who are dealing with the stress resulting from interacting with a difficult, older parent.	2002-11-30

This title is the first work I have read by John Ortberg.  I now intend to read his other books as well, so impressed was I with what I experienced here.  I have read the writings of many, many Christian teachers, and this book has become one of my few favorites.<br />Ortberg is very profound in his exposition of the Scriptures, while at the same time being very readable and understandable.  He draws upon a wealth of contemporary illustrations to support his points, which makes his teaching even more powerful.  His words strike a chord common to the hearts of all readers.<br />Ortberg targets Christians rather than non-Christians, believers who are &quot;sitting in the boat&quot; rather than &quot;walking on the water.&quot;  He encourages persons to launch forth in faith, to take chances, and to live life to its fullest.  He discourages persons from playing it safe and never putting themselves in a position to see God do what only He can.<br />I strongly recommend this book to all Christians.  Laypersons as well as ministers can benefit from this powerful message.  If you want to walk on water, you've got to get out of the boat!	2002-11-24

This autobiography of Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham, is inspiring as well as informative.  Graham gives the reader an insight into what it was like being raised in the shadow of the most famous preacher of the twentieth century.  He shares honestly and from the heart.<br />While by today's standards Graham was not that rebellious of a child, it is still refreshing to see that even the son of Billy Graham had his struggles.  Smoking, drinking, and defying authority were three of his greatest vices.  He describes his journey from a rebellious son of a minister to a servant of Jesus Christ in his own right.<br />I admire Franklin Graham for being his own person, rather than trying to become a mere imitation of his father.  While struggling for years to find his own, unique place in God's plan, as time passed he did finally discover it.  He serves today as the head of &quot;Samaritan's Purse&quot; ministry, a ministry much different than the well-known crusade ministry of his dad.<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone wanting to learn more about Franklin Graham.  I especially recommend it to the children of ministers, who may be struggling to find their own identity in the shadow their father.  This work is also a good insight into the personal dynamics of the Graham family.  Buy it, read it, and discover more about this rebel who finally found his cause!	2002-11-23

Keener here provides a superb treatment of how the Biblical passages on divorce and remarriage would have impacted first century hearers.  This book is NOT another summary of how Scriptural directives should be applied today.  Instead, it is a look at these particular verses in their first-century, Jewish, Greek and Roman historical contexts.<br />Many readers may not agree with the conclusions Keener draws, but all readers will benefit from his presentation of first-century customs regarding divorce and remarriage.  I highly recommend this work to teachers and preachers who want to research this controversial area of Christian teaching.  It is definitely well-worth the price!	2002-11-16

This book is the authors' extensive revision of their earlier work \\"Every Man's Battle.\\"  The initial book was not very helpful or accurate for older, married men. This book however, is right on target for the needs and situation of young, single men in today's sexually-charged society.<br />The theme of this work is obviously maintaining sexual purity.  The authors define authentic manhood from a biblical perspective, and then offer strategies for young men to achieve it.  Substantial attention is given to the practice of self-satisfaction and sexual release, with a commendable mixture of promoting absolute abstinence while at the same time offering empathetic encouragement.<br />The authors then present several techniques to channel visual activity and mental thought processes in a godly direction.  Perhaps the best parts of this book, unique to this version, are the two final sections.  The first section addresses sexual honor, giving a young man the perspective of a young woman's father.  It also provides insight as to what young Christian women really seek in a man, which is far different than what most young Christian men would think.  It then closes with a challenge to live a life that is sexually pure.  The second section briefly addresses young men struggling with homosexual desires, encouraging them to use the same principles to achieve biblical, heterosexual purity.<br />I recommend this book highly to Christian fathers with teenage sons, youth pastors, and young single men.  If you or a young man close to you is struggling, then this volume will undoubtedly be a great help.  This small investment is sure to yield huge dividends!	2002-11-09

A few years ago the women's Bible study in my church went through the video version of &quot;A Heart Like His.&quot;  I heard glowing reviews from one lady after another, speaking of how pertinent and powerful the material was.  Unfortunately, it was then geared exclusively to women, so I never watched the videos myself.<br />With the memory of those glowing reviews still fresh in mind, I decided to purchase the book version and see for myself if Beth Moore's teaching lived up to its reputation.  I was certainly NOT disappointed.  This book is an outstanding treatment of the triumphs and the tragedies of Israel's most famous king.<br />Moore takes practically every significant incident from David's life and applies the spiritual principles to life today.  Through her exposition here, the reader gets to know David much better, and learns why he has been called &quot;a man after God's own heart.&quot;  The author's treatment is chronological, starting from the events surrounding David's emergence on the Biblical scene as a young boy to the transfer of his throne as an old man to his son Solomon.<br />I recommend this book very highly to anyone wanting to gain a better understanding of the life of King David.  The book is very easy reading, yet is profound in its insights.  Men and women, clergy and laity alike will benefit from Moore's painstakingly thorough work.	2002-10-30

Offering answers based on church tradition is not sufficient -- persons want to know what God's Word has to say.  In this book, Jay Adams provides a very concise summary of the Biblical understanding of marriage, divorce and remarriage.<br />I commend Adams for his loyalty to the Scriptures in this volume.  On the one hand, he departs from the ultra-traditionalists who would say that any remarriage after divorce is sinful. On the other hand, he doesn't join ultra-progressives who would imply that divorce really isn't a major theological issue in today's society.  While I do not agree with his interpretation of the Matthew 18 passage as applying to divorce proceedings among two Christians, he offers many other excellent, helpful points.<br />This small yet substantial book is the best treatment I have found to date on what the Bible itself says on this knotty church issue.  Every church leader's bookshelf should have a copy.  This volume is well worth the price!	2002-10-30

The authors are determined to keep their eyes and their hearts pure, and present their means to do so.  While their intent is commendable and even contagious, their instruction is lacking in depth and substance.<br />Their techniques of \\"bouncing the eyes\\" and \\"starving the eyes\\" could very well create more problems than they solve.  Sights from everyday life that men cannot avoid are better handled by the transforming grace of God, rather than by looking away from every attractive woman encountered or by ripping the covers and selected pages from the women's magazines that wives possess.  The techniques of finding victory in one's mind and heart are a little more valid, but are still missing any emphasis on Divine activity.<br />This book is much more of a \\"why should I\\" manual rather than a \\"how do I\\" manual.  Every sincere, biblically-based Christian man desires sexual purity, but the primary way to achieve it is through surrender to the power and presence of God.  The practices of bouncing and starving the eyes, corralling thoughts and cherishing one's wife have their place, but are no substitute for Divine transformation of character.<br />For a much better treatment of male sexuality from a Christian perspective, try \\"The Sexual Man\\" by Archibald Hart.	2002-10-19

In his other books, Yancey is much more biblical and direct.  In this volume, he waxes philosophical as he speaks of the Christian's challenges to live by faith and not by sight.<br />He describes the challenges of longing after God, believing in God, interacting with God, being transformed by God, growing in God, and finally being liberated by God.  This book has some good insights along the way, and is an enjoyable read.  Yancey's reputation as a leading Christian author is reinforced here once again.<br />While good, this book was lacking in greatness.  His work here pales in comparison to \\"The Jesus I Never Knew\\" and \\"What's So Amazing About Grace?\\"  For die-hard Yancey fans, this volume is undoubtedly another winner.  The rest of us are left longing for the punch that is so powerfully present in Yancey's other writings.	2002-10-18

Franklin Graham in this outstanding work provides a prophetic wake-up call to the church of the 21st century. Drawing upon the recent Columbine tragedy and the very recent terrorist attacks, the author asserts that more spiritual guidance is needed than mere references to a generic God. He encourages Christians to pray and to speak as Christians, boldly calling upon the name of Jesus Christ.<br />Graham does not bash other religions -- he does bash the tendency of American society today to be tolerant towards all religions EXCEPT Christianity. He also insightfully states that the framework for our current tolerance of various beliefs is founded upon a Christian value system. He describes the lack of tolerance and freedom of religion in countries that have another religion's value system as a basis instead of Christianity.<br />Graham in this book is right on target. This work should be read by every Christian pastor, leader and teacher. The Church needs to realize that the Name of Jesus Christ is not to be avoided, but affirmed. To do otherwise would deny the very heart of the Christian faith.<br />As a Christian response to the politically correct religious climate that has arisen since 9/11, this book is second-to-none.	2002-10-04

The main reason for my reading is to be familiar with the works so many persons in my congregation are reading.  LaHaye's view of the end times reads into the Bible a timeline theology that the Bible does not promote.  LaHaye and Jenkins have succeeded however, in making a mint from their sensationalized presentation.<br />The only redeeming point of this book, and others in the series, is that it encourages persons to be ready for the bodily return of Jesus Christ, which is very much a biblical event that will occur in the future.  LaHaye leaves no doubt here as to how a person can become a follower of Christ.  He clearly explains the gospel in a way that is easily understood and readily accepted.<br />If all you want is a good Christian fiction series that provides a clear presentation of the need to follow Christ, then read this book.  If you want a book on what the Bible says about the end times however, then save your time and money and invest them elsewhere.  The soteriology of LaHaye and Jenkins is solid, but their eschatology is shabby and simply doesn't square with Scripture.	2002-09-29

As a pastor, I am always receptive to learn more about leading God's people in worship.  This book is an excellent resource that would be an asset to every pastor's bookshelf.  Allen and Borror do an outstanding job of presenting key components of Christian worship.<br />The authors define worship, then proceed to speak of the necessity of balance in worship services.  Worship services should be characterized by upreach, inreach and outreach.  In other words, worship services should consist of loving God, loving one another, and loving the world in a desire for their salvation.  In the latter portion of this work, the authors focus on various components of worship services, such as the use of &quot;amen,&quot; physical participation, public Scripture reading, music ministry, and an appropriate environment.<br />I recommend this book highly to all pastors, worship leaders, and other persons who will be leading the body of Christ in adoration and praise.	2002-09-25

His points are simple yet profound as he makes his case for the necessity of a strong and systematic prayer life.  This tenth anniversary edition reinforces and elaborates upon the truths Hybels illustrated previously.<br />In the first portion of his book, Hybels focuses upon God and his willingness to answer prayer. He then moves to the role we play, describing various challenges and obstacles to effective, life-changing prayer.  The best part of this work is the third portion, in which he emphasizes the importance of listening to God, responding to His leadings, and living in His presence.<br />There are many books available on prayer, a large number of which I have read.  I cannot think of one other single volume however, that describes the vital nature of prayer, and offers practical tools for prayer, than this book.<br />Get it, read it, then see for yourself the difference God makes in your own prayer life!	2002-09-23

This hardback edition of Tolkien's trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Twin Towers, and The Return of the King) is a MUST for the bookshelf of any J.R.R. Tolkien fan!  I watched the first movie before reading the book, and I must say the movie is a disappointment.  While it is fascinating to see Tolkien's characters depicted on the big screen with dazzling special effects, the movie still pales in comparison to the vivid word pictures and painstaking attention to detail the author presents in this classic work.<br />With all the publicity surrounding the Fellowship of the Ring movie, most persons are familiar with the basic plot:  the hobbit, Frodo Baggins, is given the daunting task of destroying the great Ring that offers ultimate power and conquest for its bearer.  This tale describes the adventures Frodo and his company experience as they make their way towards Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed within the fires of the dark summit.<br />I recommend this hardcover version highly over the paperback edition, for it likely will be read more than once in one's lifetime.  The extra money paid for the hardcover edition is well worth the additional investment.  If you enjoy Tolkien, buy this book, read it, then read it again!  It will serve as an excellent point of reference for the current and the future movies based upon it.	2002-09-23

He then addresses various principles of success or greatness:  power, commitment, servanthood, humility, obedience, and joy.  Following an explanation of each principle and its biblical basis, Hybels includes a current-life illustration to drive his point home.  He concludes his work by sharing his own personal story of descending into greatness, appealing to the reader to follow the biblical pattern.  His conclusion is the most powerful part of the entire book.<br />I wholehearted recommend this book to all Christians, but especially to Christian leaders who are pursuing success.

Regardless if one's position is Calvinistic or not, this book provides a classic, timeless defense of five-point Calvinism.  Sproul's arguments are persuasive and biblically based, so staunch Arminians will face a formidable challenge.<br />Sproul begins by sharing his own personal struggle as a former-Arminian (advocate of free-will salvation).  He then relates that as he studied the Bible more intensely, he learned that it is more important for us to believe what the Scriptures SAY rather than what we would LIKE for them to say.  Sproul didn't savor the prospect of being a Calvinist (advocate of predestined salvation), but moved to that stance because of the biblical support for it.<br />The author address each of the five points of Calvinism:<br />Total depravity of man<br />Unconditional election<br />Limited atonement<br />Irresistible grace<br />Perseverance of the saints<br />Sproul gives special attention to the \\"total depravity\\" of man, renaming it \\"radical corruption.\\"  He modifies other points of the well-known \\"TULIP\\" acrostic, using more accurate terms where necessary.  He closes his book by offering responses to commonly raised questions regarding the Reformed (Calvinistic) position.<br />This book is a definite MUST READ for pastors and teachers.  I am unaware of any other volume that defines so clearly and concisely the Reformed position.  Buy it, read it and grow in your understanding of Reformed theology!	2002-08-05

There are thousands of books available on how to prepare for marriage, how to improve upon a marriage, or how to affair-proof a marriage.  Mason here departs from the crowd and exults in the institution of marriage itself.  His perspective is one of reverent awe rather than analytical examination.<br />Mason ponders the mystery of marriage from several different angles:  otherness, love, intimacy, vows, sex, submission and death.  His words are readable, yet profound.  His book considers the greatest delights of marriage as well as the greatest demands.<br />I recommend this volume to anyone wanting to get a better understanding of how God has created marriage, and how He manifests His glory and His grand design through it.  I have read many other books on marriage, but none with this unique, awe-inspiring approach.  This work is a true classic!	2002-07-30

Crabb introduces this work by claiming he has experienced a shift in thinking.  He proposes that more is needed to minister to emotional needs than just psychological training or biblical theology.  He asserts that connected relationships are the missing link in touching the hearts and souls of hurting people.<br />Crabb describes three elements of &quot;connecting&quot; with others, and then through the remainder of the book elaborates on each.  The first element is a taste of Christ delighting in us.  As we display this same kind of delight in the personalities and lifestyles of others, our relationships are transformed.  The second element is a diligent search for what is good.  Rather than just identifying what is sinful, or trying to fix what is wrong, we discover what God is doing in others lives then affirm it.  The third element is an engaging exposure of what is bad or painful.  This element must always follow the first two elements, but may not always be necessary.  When it is exercised however, it exposes the bad in order to unleash the good.<br />I wholeheartedly endorse Crabb's work here -- the more we as believers can &quot;connect&quot; with other believers in the body of Christ, the stronger and healthier we can become.  For the depth of the subjects covered, Crabb does a remarkable job of making his words pleasant to read and his train-of-thought easy to follow.  I recommend this book to all persons wanting to discover new strength and healing through connected relationships in Jesus Christ.	2002-07-29

If you are looking for a book to provide guidelines for Christian journaling, your search will end with reading this work by Luann Budd.  This devout Christian and minister's wife shares valuable insights gleaned from years of journaling.  Her book is an easy, enjoyable read.<br />Budd begins by making a case for effective journaling.  She covers organization, direction, and preparation.  After having made her case for the necessity of journaling, she moves to the bulk of her work, the process of journaling itself. She elaborates on various methods, one of which will surely appeal to every reader.  She closes with some practical tips on putting all the knowledge presented into practice.  She also adds three helpful appendices:  fifty journaling possibilities, a brief list of Bible studies, and a substantial bibliography of books on journaling and other closely related issues.<br />I recommend this book enthusiastically to anyone wanting a practical guide for Christian journaling.  My sole complaint is that the volume is not available in a hardback edition.  Before you start your journaling, read this book and benefit from a wealth of training!	2002-07-26

His theme, in accordance with the title, is that Christian maturity must come from the inside out.  His goal is not just for believers to do good, but to be good.<br />The author opens his book by describing three common ways Christian maturity is mistakenly perceived to occur.  The first way is by doing our Christian duty.  This method is primarily a matter of willpower, and ends in discouragement.  The second way is by depending on a special work of the Holy Spirit.  This method is an improvement, but still does not compel us to face directly the sins in our hearts that may lie below the surface.  The third way is by working through obstacles to growth.  Psychologists who encourage us to examine unresolved issues in our hearts and minds champion this method.  The shortcoming of this approach is that repentance of hidden sin never occurs.<br />In the remainder of his book, Crabb describes a new understanding of Christian maturity that combines the three ways just mentioned.  The author then adds another dimension, that of repentance of deep sin.  To identify this sin we must take an &quot;inside look&quot; that is illuminated by the Spirit of God, the Word of God, and the people of God.<br />I recommend this work highly to Christian pastors, leaders, and professionals.  For many believers the language may be too technical and intense, but apart from that shortcoming it is a very enlightening read.  It is definitely worth the price!	2002-07-23

I agree wholeheartedly with her conclusion, but wish she had chosen a better means to support it.  This volume draws heavily upon the sociological definitions of &quot;boomer&quot; and &quot;buster.&quot; It interviews various worship leaders to get their perspectives on what is currently effective for them in ministry.  It rambles in an almost endless explanation of what is required to reach &quot;Seeker Bob&quot; and &quot;Shopper Bruce.&quot;<br />The bottom line here is that Morgenthaler's destination is commendable.  Genuine worship CAN reach the unchurched for Christ.  Her method of getting the reader to that destination however, is mediocre at best and could stand much improvement.<br />I would recommend that if anyone is interesting in learning more about this book, borrow, don't buy.  Skim, don't read.  The time and energy spent in covering every page would be better invested elsewhere.	2002-07-21

His presentation however, is lacking in readability and relevance.  His intention is to describe how God works to transform persons into disciples of Christ.<br />The author throughout this volume elaborates on the six human dimensions in which God brings change:  thought, feeling, will, body, social context, and soul. His insights are very helpful, especially to Christian leaders and pastors.  He stresses that discipleship is not an option for the follower of Christ, but is the essence of what it means to be a follower of Christ.<br />Willard undoubtedly is a gifted thinker and devout believer. If his writing style were not so bland and even boring at times, he would minister to a much wider audience.  As it is, I can recommend this book only to professional Christian leaders who have the time and the motivation to mine the nuggets of truth found here.	2002-07-08

I have now read all three of the books in the Sacred Romance series.  The last two volumes authored by John Eldridge are far superior to the first volume co-authored with the late Brent Curtis.  It appears God has used the painful, tragic death of a close friend to make a much better writer of John Eldridge.<br />This work is not so much about desire for life in itself, but rather about the lack of desire for life and the regaining of it.  Eldridge speaks of a passion for living, and how multitudes of Christians have lost it by settling for little or no passion at all.  The author takes the reader through a literary journey to recapture the deepest desire of one's heart, which is ultimately nothing less than a love relationship with God himself.<br />I enthusiastically recommend this book and the third book in the Sacred Romance series, \\"Wild at Heart.\\"  The author is Scriptural, spiritual, and sound theologically.  Your devotional life will be greatly enhanced as a result of reading them.	2002-06-30

This work by Richard and Henry Blackaby is the absolute best book on leadership I have read.  Having recently graduated with a doctorate in evangelism and church growth, and possessing a passion for reading pastoral material, I have read numerous books on leadership.  All of them pale in comparison to this volume.<br />The authors focus upon a leader's relationship with God as the key to effective leadership.  From this relationship flow a leader's vision, goals, influence, and decision-making.  All of the basic leadership principles are covered in this book, but they are addressed from the perspective of one's relationship with God.  This perspective is what makes this work so unique and so valuable.<br />I strongly recommend this book to all pastors, church leaders and even to Christian leaders in secular organizations as a &quot;must read.&quot;  Before reading the volumes of material available from Maxwell, Schaller and other noted leadership authors, try this one!  It will transform the way you view leadership as a Christian.	2002-06-24

Curtis and Eldridge provide a new perspective here on a human being's need for a love relationship with God.  While containing many references to the Scriptures, the basic themes within the book are elaborations on Biblical truth rather than expositions of Biblical truth.  In other words, this volume is built AROUND the Bible rather than UPON the Bible.<br />The fresh, vivid nature of this work may motivate some readers to open their hearts to a more intimate walk with Jesus Christ. After reading Eldredge's third volume in this series, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; and being favorably impressed, I was disappointed in the quality of this initial undertaking.  A far better book on the same subject is A.W. Tozer's &quot;The Pursuit of God.&quot;	2002-06-21

Yancey has a fine reputation as a Christian author, and this work adds to his credentials.  The theme of this book is not simply Jesus Christ, but how the true Jesus of the Scriptures contrasts the traditional Jesus of history.  Yancey weaves his own thoughts and experiences throughout this volume, a feature that makes his presentation even more appealing.<br />The author begins by describing the traditional Jesus, the Jesus he thought he knew.  He then turns to the Bible and begins to unfold the authentic account of this historical God-Man.  He describes in detail who Jesus was, why He came, and what He left behind Him.  Yancey's words strike home to Christians, speaking prophetically to them and challenging them to follow anew the radical call of their Lord.<br />I have read several of Yancey's books, and have yet to be disappointed.  This volume is well worth the money and the time required for reading.  For a refreshing, Biblical presentation of the life of Jesus Christ and its centrality to the Christian faith, buy this book!	2002-06-08

Philip Yancey strikes a chord here that resounds in the heart of every true believer.  He speaks of the unique nature of grace, and how it is desperately needed in the Church today.  Yancey confronts modern Christians with the problem of &quot;ungrace,&quot; the striking absence of the grace that so characterized Jesus Christ.<br />While targeted primarily towards conservative Christians, this work also applies to those persons who have more liberal views.  Believers on both ends of the spectrum can be sorely lacking in grace, a quality that can only be shown by the Church.<br />Up to this point, the best modern book I have read on grace is &quot;Grace Awakening&quot; by Charles Swindoll.  Yancey's work surpasses Swindoll's volume by virtue of its contemporary applications and illustrations.  There are few recent books on grace available today, and this one is the best of which I am aware.<br />I recommend this book HIGHLY to all conservative Christians, especially persons who would identify themselves with the &quot;Religious Right.&quot; Yancey truly emphasizes the fundamentals here.  One note of caution:  if you DON'T want your heart to be warmed by God's grace and compassion, then avoid this book!	2002-06-04

Many of those books are shallow theologically and draw little if any from the rich heritage of the Church.  Foster's volume combines a knowledge of church history's classic devotional writers with a freshness appealing to the 21st century.<br />Foster describes various forms of prayer, dividing them into three general categories:  inward-focused prayer provides us with personal transformation, upward-focused prayer offers us intimacy with God, outward-focused prayer places us in the ministries that God would have us fill.<br />Don't let the title fool you. This volume is NOT just another book on what some persons may call &quot;prayer lite.&quot;  Foster presents a solid work that is grounded in the theology as well as the history of the Church.

Usually only one chapter is devoted to sex, and then the attention is focused on the activity of marital sex itself rather than the broader subject of male/female sexuality.  In this book, Hart provides the feminine counterpart to his earlier, masculine work, \\"The Sexual Man.\\"<br />This book has a strong Christian perspective, and the author makes no apologies for it. In fact, one of the main reasons Hart wrote this work is to give an accurate treatment of CHRISTIAN female sexuality, which differs in several ways from secular treatments of the same topic.<br />Reading this book will enhance your marriage, and will be especially helpful if you have a Christian marriage.  It will also be a tremendous asset if you are single.  This work isn't just for women -- it is a work ABOUT women, for women as well as for men.

After 15 years, Harley's work is as profound now as it was when first published.  Harley has revised his book in various places, updating it based upon lessons learned since the previous edition and making it applicable to marital challenges of the 21st century.  His concepts are powerful and practical.  While written by a conservative Christian author, these principles are applicable to persons regardless of their religious background.<br />Harley's approach to \\"affair-proofing\\" a marriage centers on a concept he labels \\"the love bank.\\"  Every husband and wife has a love bank that encounters both deposits and withdrawals from the opposite sex.  A crucial distinction is made, however, in that deposits and withdrawals are made differently with men than they are with women.  These differences are based upon the ten most felt needs of a relationship with the opposite gender.  Husbands, in general, place the highest importance on the following five needs:  sexual fulfillment, recreational companionship, an attractive spouse, domestic support, and admiration.  Wives, in general, place the highest importance on the following five needs:  affection, conversation, honesty and openness, financial support, and family commitment.  Both genders express need for all ten items, but typically husbands and wives have contrasting priorities.<br />According to Harley, when an individual meets one or more of the partner's greatest felt needs, deposits are made into the partner's love bank.  When one or more needs are not met, withdrawals are made from the partner's love bank.  An affair occurs when a spouse finds fulfillment for a strongly felt need elsewhere because it is not being met satisfactorily within the marriage.<br />Harley's love bank concept is the centerpiece of his best-selling work.  While his list of felt needs may not apply precisely to every man and woman, he does present a very accurate picture for most men and women in our society today.  He concludes his book with giving tips on surviving an affair, and offering hope to couples struggling with a sense of incompatibility.<br />If you are serious about preparing for marriage, protecting your marriage, or propelling your marriage to even greater heights, this book is a must.

Most Christians struggle with the demands and frustrations resulting from their everyday relationships.  Cloud and Townsend have produced a true classic in this volume, presenting Biblical concepts that address those demands and frustrations.  I have just finished reading this book again for the second time, and chances are good I will read it again in the future.<br />The authors introduce their work with a short section entitled, &quot;A Day in a Boundaryless Life.&quot; Most persons can easily identify with the young woman depicted in this typical life situation.  The authors then describe the concept of boundaries in detail, and how boundaries are developed in our lives.  They present ten laws of boundaries, and then proceed to describe common myths regarding them.  These laws and myths, as well as the rest of the book's content, are very readable and easy to understand.<br />In the second portion of their work, the authors touch upon the areas of life in which boundaries can be helpful.  I cannot think of any area that is unaffected.  These areas are: family, friends, spouse, children, work, self, and God.<br />The authors conclude by describing typical resistance to boundaries.  They also summarize the benefits to be gained as persons persevere through that resistance to a more ordered life. Before ending their book, Cloud and Townsend revisit the young woman depicted in the opening section.  This time the title is, &quot;A Day in a Life with Boundaries.&quot;  She now has learned to incorporate boundaries into her own life, and the change for the better is amazing.<br />This book is a must-read for every Christian believer who wants a wealth of Biblical insight into Christ-honoring relationships.

I just finished reading Richard Foster's &quot;Celebration of Discipline&quot; for the second time.  I read it many years ago in seminary, but wanted to refresh my memory with its principles.  I am so glad I did!<br />Twenty years later, Foster still offers a superb work here that focuses on the devotional life of the believer.  This book is divided into three sections:  the inward Disciplines, the outward Disciplines, and the corporate Disciplines.  Foster acknowledges that God is the author of all spiritual growth, but indicates that the Disciplines help us position ourselves so that the growth will more easily occur.<br />He says, &quot;God has given us the Disciplines of the spiritual life as a means of receiving his grace.  The Disciplines allow us to place ourselves before God so that he can transform us&quot; (page 7).<br />This book is a true classic, and should be a part of every Christian's library.

Broyles covers six types of journaling:  from the events of daily life, in response to Scripture, with guided meditations, from dreams, in response to reading, and in reflection on conversations or dialogues.<br />This book is definitely an easy read, but is sorely lacking in solid content.  I will most likely purchase another book on this topic that is not specifically oriented to Christians.  The best thing I gained from this book was news of the Upper Room devotional website, where a person can subscribe to a variety of Christian devotional emails.<br />I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a book giving good, solid journaling techniques.

I have been in the pastoral ministry for twenty years, and I cannot think of one ethical issue for ministers they have not addressed.

Still, the tone of the chapters and the treatment of the issues are presented in such a way as to apply to all ministers, regardless of denomination.<br />I recommend this title very highly.

Coming from the perspective of a person who is Biblical grounded and well acquainted with the concerns of women, Kassian offers priceless insight on the pitfalls of the feminist mindset.  The concept of &quot;naming&quot; flows throughout this book.  Naming refers to women defining their own identity, creating their own place in the world, and even establishing God as the person/force who most effectively exalts the value of women.  When Biblical truth clashes with any aspect of this naming process, the truth is sacrificed or &quot;reinterpreted&quot; in a manner that will support it.<br />Kassian's work has four basic sections:  naming self, naming the world, naming God, and assessing the right to name.<br />In the first three sections, Kassian describes the evolution of feminism both outside and inside the church.  Most readers will get bogged down in these sections, because she is so painstakingly devoted to detail.  In section four, however, she pulls the previous three sections together as she assesses the right to name from a Biblical perspective.<br />Kassian offers an excellent review of feminism in this work. The motivators behind the issues of women serving as elders/pastors and gender-neutral Bible translations are much easier to identify as a result of Kassian's effort.  I recommend this book highly, especially to pastors, church leaders and teachers.	2002-04-06

I began reading this book with high expectations regarding the insights the author would have to offer.  I was certainly not disappointed.  Foster divides his work into two parts.  In part one, he lays a foundation for a life of simplicity based upon the Old and New Testaments.  He also draws upon church history to illustrate the advantages of not being distracted by worldly possessions and pursuits.<br />In part two, Foster puts the concept of simplicity into action.  He speaks of inward simplicity which aligns our lives properly with God.  He then refers to outward simplicity, which relates us in a fitting manner to persons around us.  He closes his book by referring to corporate simplicity in the church and in the world.  Sadly, his work would have been better had he omitted these last two chapters.  In them, Foster's liberal economic and political views rise to the surface, strongly overshadowing the Biblical argument he has so skillfully presented earlier.<br />Still, in an age characterized by materialism within and without the church, this book gives a fresh new perspective on focusing on things eternal that cannot be bought or sold.  I recommend it highly.	2002-04-02

Perhaps it was a case of the title having to fulfill so much of the hype it has received.  While the author gives helpful tips on Christian marriage, there are definitely better books available on this topic.<br />Smalley opens his book with an example from his own personal experience of counseling a troubled couple.  While he is certainly sincere and full of compassion, the repeated references to his own ministry distract from the points he is trying to convey.<br />He continues by giving specific guidance on how the husband and the wife can be more understanding and supportive of their spouses.  He then moves to the relational aspects of marriage, identifying practices and concepts that can breathe life back into a stagnant union.  He closes his book with advice on making the most of severe trials, saying we must celebrate God's purpose in them rather than questioning God's plan.<br />There are three other books on Christian marriage I would recommend above this one:  &quot;His Needs, Her Needs&quot; by Willard Harley; &quot;Boundaries in Marriage&quot; by Cloud and Townsend; and &quot;Saving Your Marriage Before it Starts&quot; by Les and Leslie Parrott.<br />Unless you are a Gary Smalley fan or have an extremely strong curiosity about this book, I would recommend one of the three titles listed above for solid, Biblical tips on marriage enhancement.	2002-03-28

It is easy to see why Kent Hughes' book has been such a best seller.  The author has compiled in these pages an invaluable collection of helpful, spiritual advice for men in the 21st century. I am not aware of a more comprehensive volume that covers so many topics within one cover.<br />Hughes identifies the following life areas: relationships, soul, character, ministry, and grace.  He then provides specific disciplines that each cultivate a more dynamic Christian lifestyle.  His advice is Biblically sound, culturally relevant, and easy to understand.<br />This book will be very helpful to any man who desires to grow deeper in his devotion to Jesus Christ.  While it is only an introductory work, it provides a solid foundation on which to begin a more structured approach to discipleship.  I recommend it highly.	2002-03-25

One of reasons could well be a confusion on the roles the Bible prescribes for marriage.  Although this book presents the idea of the husband as the head of the relationship, it does not present him as the &quot;boss&quot; or as a modern-day Archie Bunker.  Instead, men are strongly encouraged in this book to take the lead in serving, in supporting, and in sustaining the other members of the family.<br />The authors begin by defining the confusion over marital roles today, and the resulting chaos.  They then outline the husband's role as servant-leader, and describe his core concerns.  The wife's role is then outlined as helper-lover, and her concerns are also presented.<br />Two chapters are devoted to the idea of submission, dispeling many myths regarding it.  Common problems are addressed, and practical applications are provided.  The book closes with two helpful appendices recounting the breakdown of gender roles in ancient Rome, and the impact that Paul's words had on that generation.<br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly for both husbands and wives desiring to gain a better understanding of a Biblical-oriented marriage.	2002-03-15

One camp believes that modern scholars are being motivated by a feminist agenda to re-write the Word of God.  Another camp believes that complementarian Christians are promoting their own specialized agenda in their opposition to &quot;gender accurate&quot; translations.  Carson does a fine job of diffusing the issue by allowing persons in both camps to understand one another better.<br />This book basically has three sections.  The first section describes the crisis that occurred in 1997 when the IBS and Zondervan initially announced plans for a &quot;gender-accurate&quot; update of the NIV.  It details the positions of both sides with fairness, including the hasty compromise agreement reached in Colorado Springs.  The second section is difficult reading, for Carson describes extensively the painstaking process of Biblical translation from Hebrew/Greek into English.  The third section is a rather brief but extremely beneficial summary of the ongoing controversy regarding gender-accurate translations.<br />Carson, as a complementarian, does not endorse all gender-neutral translations, but neither does he condemn them all.  Rather, he sees benefit in judicious use of gender-accurate translation when necessary to communicate the initial meaning of the ancient text.  He sees value to the NIVI (Gender-neutral translation of the NIV in Great Britain), but highlights instances in which gender translation has been done poorly.<br />I recommend this work highly to anyone, particularly a pastor or a Bible teacher, who is struggling with the recent flood of gender-accurate translations.  Carson's goal is to bring understanding and reconciliation to Bible-believing Christians who are divided over this issue of Scriptural semantics.  He has assisted me in my own struggle, and will likely do the same for many other believers.ill likely do the same for many other believers.	2002-03-14

All of these authors could have made their arguments much more concise and readable, but none of them chose to do so.<br />Hick basically states that many different religions lead to the same God.  Pinnock holds that salvation in Christ may be found through other religions.  McGrath asserts salvation is found in a relationship with Christ, and persons who have had no chance to enter that relationship MIGHT receive God's mercy in some unknown way.  Geivett and Phillips maintain salvation is ONLY found in a relationship with Christ, and persons who have had no chance to enter that relationship will spend eternity separated from God.<br />This book could have and should have been written in such a manner to appeal to the average layperson.  These individuals are the ones who struggle with these issues and want to be better informed.  Instead, all of these essays are directed towards other scholars.  The overly-technical manner in which they are written will not appeal to most persons without professional theological training.<br />For pastors and well-versed teachers, this book provides a helpful summary of four current views on salvation.  For everyone else, this volume will be confusing and hard to follow.	2002-03-09

Obviously, it consists of four authors submitting defenses of their particular positions.  A couple of the writers are more persuasive than their colleagues.  This persuasiveness, however, stems more from the positions themselves rather than from the skill of the persons penning them.<br />Walvoord begins with a simplistic, fundamentalist position of literal, eternal fire.  Walvoord does a decent job of making his point.  The issue is muddled, unfortunately, with the mantra of literal interpretation as the only method for persons who believe the Bible is inerrant.  The connection with dispensationalism is apparent in the frequent, literal application of passages in Revelation.<br />Crockett steps to the plate next with the metaphorical view. His presentation is the most convincing of the four, partially because of his skill but mainly because of the strength of the argument itself.  Crockett sticks to the point and drives it home.<br />Hayes takes his turn defending the purgatorial position.  I was a bit surprised to find a serious consideration given to the idea of purgatory in a work of this nature.  Hayes deserves credit for making a valiant attempt to communicate a Catholic belief to a predominantly Protestant audience.  He offers little Scriptural support for his position, simply because there is little Scriptural support to be found.<br />Pinnock concludes the presentations with his view of annihilation.  Pinnock is not as convincing as Crockett, but gives some substantial Scriptural evidence and theological reasoning to support his position.  Crockett does an excellent job of refuting Pinnock's argument in the brief response he offers.<br />I intially planned to give this volume three or four stars, because at least two of the arguments presented are extremely weak. On second thought, however, the presentations are all fairly well done -- the problem is with the positions themselves. For anyone wanting a good overview of four doctrines of hell, I strongly recommend this book.lves.

I've read a few of the other reviews here, and I frankly can't agree with the negative sentiments.  Whether or not a person has a complementarian perspective, this book is still very informative and well written.  It is not intended to be a book that is read from its beginning to its conclusion (although I did).  Instead, it serves more as a reference volume, addressing various issues of men and women in marriage and in ministry.  There are five sections that comprise this work.<br />The first section is an overview that moves rather quickly and sets the stage for the sections to follow.  Exegetical and theological in nature, the second section is very meticulous and may be boring to some readers. The third section addresses male/female issues in church history, biology, psychology, sociology and law.  After establishing a strong basis of support, the fourth section proceeds to apply the ways in which men and women can complement one another today in the the church, in the home, and in society.  The fifth section briefly summarizes and comments upon the many points that have been made.<br />I recommend this title as a REFERENCE book.  Reading it from cover to cover will prove challenging, much like trying to read an encyclopedia.  Still, this work is a classic.  I know of no other book on the market that provides such a strong, comprehensive explanation of the complementarian position.<br />For the pastor or teacher who is dealing with the issues surrounding the roles of men and women in marriage and in ministry, this book is a MUST READ.	2002-03-01

Strauch hits all the major points, and provides a good summary of complementarian thought.  He definitely achieves his intended purpose.<br />This volume would be an excellent basis for a Bible study with a group of laypersons, or as an addition to a smaller church library.<br />For a MUCH more elaborate, detailed and scholarly treatment of the complementarian viewpoint, try &quot;Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood&quot; by John Piper and Wayne Grudem.<br />If it's a quick, easy-to-read overview of what the Bible says on gender relationships that you want, however, then this book is the one to buy.	2002-02-16

Especially after striking a deal with James Dobson and other reputable, conservative Christian leaders NOT to produce a gender-neutral NIV at any time in the future, I was fit to be tied when I read the news!  How dare they &quot;water-down&quot; the translation of the Bible I have used in my twenty years of pastoral ministry just to appease a minority of vocal, feminist interests in the evangelical church!<br />Anyway, Strauss approaches the issue of gender-neutral translation from the standpoint of a complementarian who has a very high view of Scripture. He definitely does NOT have a feminist agenda.  He actually identifies merits of the gender-neutral translation process that help make God's eternal truth more understandable in today's culture.<br />Particularly of help to me was his detailed description of the translation process.  A gender-oriented Hebrew or Greek word can be used in a variety of different ways in the ancient manuscripts, just as a gender-oriented word can be used in a variety of different ways in modern English.  Strauss emphasizes the struggle sincere, conservative scholars have with gender-related issues as they pursue Biblical ACCURACY, not feminist APPEASEMENT.<br />I'm still not happy with the way the release of the TNIV has been handled, and I don't agree with the need to be as gender-inclusive as the CBT translators have been.  Strauss' work has helped me greatly, however, to understand the motives of the &quot;other side.&quot; It has also opened my eyes to the truth that there is actually some merit to gender-neutral translation when it is done for the sake of communicating clearly the original message of the author, and not for the sake of advancing a particular theological or political agenda.<br />If you're struggling with the TNIV as I have done, I strongly recommend you purchase this book.strongly recommend you purchase this book.	2002-02-16

Gender-neutral &quot;translations&quot; of the Bible have been on the market for more than a decade, but with the recent introduction of the TNIV by Zondervan and the International Bible Society, they are suddenly getting much more attention and scrutiny. Poythress and Grudem are very scholarly and thorough in their approach to the gender-neutral translation issue.<br />I must say that unless a person has an INTENSE interest in this subject (as I do as a pastor), purchasing the small booklet &quot;What's Wrong with Gender Neutral Bible Translations?&quot; would be a much better investment of money AND time.  (It is available from the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood for a modest fee.)<br />This book describes how the modern feminist agenda has influenced the translators of the Bible, compelling them to mute the patriarchalism inherent in the ancient texts.  It may be polite and politically correct today to avoid using the &quot;generic he&quot; and other masculine language in written documents. The authors assert, however, that translators cannot avoid masculine overtones and at the same time accurately translate the Scriptures.<br />This volume identifies and describes in detail the numerous arguments used by scholars who support gender-neutral language in Bible translations.  It then proceeds to show the fallacies present in their reasoning.  Poythress and Grudem are far from intellectual lightweights -- they each hold degrees from both Harvard and the University of Cambridge.<br />I recommend this book highly to any pastor or scholar who is interested in a superb intellectual rebuttal to the gender-neutral Bible translation rationale that has been promoted over the last decade.	2002-02-15

If you as a Christian are looking for a good book to help you discuss differences of belief with a Muslim friend, then look no more!  This volume is an excellent summary by a noted Christian apologist.  It is a great start on understanding Islamic beliefs from a Christian perspective.<br />It must be understood from the outset that this book has a definite Christian bias.  It is not likely to be warmly accepted by Muslims, nor is that kind of reception its intent.  This volume is a Christian apologetic work, summarizing Islam, identifying weaknesses in its major beliefs, then elaborating on the ways in which Christianity is superior to it.<br />Geisler and Saleeb (a former Muslim) begin by describing the Islamic positions on monotheism, creation, prophets, Muhammad, the Quran, and the end of time.  They then move to responding from a Christian viewpoint to these positions. The subjects of monotheism, Muhammad, and the Quran are given particular attention.<br />Geisler and Saleeb conclude the main body of their work with a defense of the Bible, the deity of Jesus, the trinity, and the substitutionary death of Christ.  Four helpful appendices are included.  They describe Muslim sects, religious practices, the Gospel of Barnabas, and Islamic objections to the authority of the New Testament.<br />For a Christian wanting to share his faith relationally with a Muslim friend, this volume is the one to buy!	2002-02-12

As a former Wordsearch user, I wanted more &quot;muscle&quot; in my Bible software.  As I switched to Logos 2.1, I was not disappointed with the increase in abilities.  I was frustrated, however, by the complexity of the interface.<br />When Logos Series X was released, I upgraded directly through Logos to the Scholar's Edition (which I feel is by far the best buy for a pastor or teacher familiar with the original languages).  I couldn't be happier with this product!  The interface has been completely revised, providing ease of use and intensive search capabilities of all unlocked resources.  I am also impressed with the vast number of books that are available now in the Logos format.<br />I see hardbound reference libraries becoming a thing of the past for ministers and teachers.

I have read a few of the other reviews on this book, and I must respectfully disagree with the idea of it being biased against the complementarian view.  On the contrary, I feel the main text is very balanced, with the large appendix by Blomberg (a complementarian) tipping the scales towards the complementarian position.<br />I doubt if this work will change anyone's mind who already has a firm grasp of where he stands on this issue.  It does, however, provide a fair and accurate presentation of both viewpoints so that they can be thoroughly examined.  There are actually a total of five essays here; two essays by egalitarians, two essays by complementarians, and one large appendix by Blomberg, which is somewhat of a hybrid between the two positions.<br />As a complementarian, I have developed an even greater appreciation for the role of women in ministry as a result of reading this work.  The spirit of Ann Bowman's remark (as a complementarian) is particularly memorable for me:  &quot;Rather than focusing on what women should not be doing, I believe it's important to focus on what they should be doing.&quot;<br />This work is the third title I have read in the Counterpoints series.  Although the scholarly tone may be rather heavy for some laymen, pastors and teachers will be greatly benefited and enlightened by the presentations found here.  I recommend it highly as a good, concise summary of today's viewpoints on the issue of women in ministry.	2002-02-02

I was disappointed in what I found.  The author does not present clear lines of thought, and tends to ramble in places where a brief summary would be more in order.  The book is clearly dated with an overly &quot;clerical&quot; tone that would be unfamiliar to a person considering ministry.  The use of the King James Version for Scriptural references would also be a distraction for younger readers.<br />Still, there are some good points scattered throughout the book that make it worth the reading for an older minister working with ministerial candidates.  For the candidates themselves, however, an easier-to-read, more modern presentation would be much more useful.  My search for a small book providing a helpful summary for God's call to ministry continues.	2002-01-28

It is the only integrated postmillennial eschatology I have found to date.  It is a must-read for end times scholars, but would be rather weighty for most other believers.<br />Gentry introduces his work by speaking of the significance of eschatology, showing its relation to all other areas of theology. He comes across as somewhat condescending, unfortunately, in his assessement of all other millennial views as &quot;pessimistic.&quot;  On this very complex and controversial Biblical topic, an ability to agree to disagree MUST be cultivated.<br />Gentry shows how postmillennialism is weaved into all aspects of Biblical history with five chapters on creation, anticipation, realization, expansion, and consummation.  Each chapter is filled with Scripture references.  Gentry allows the Bible to speak for itself, and does not try to impose his theological system upon it. The author then moves to various eschatological themes and characters, interpreting each in the light of postmillennialism.<br />An added bonus is the inclusion of a brief commentary on the book of Revelation.  He addresses various concepts and characters in Revelation, then skims through the book chapter by chapter.  Gentry closes with a response to several common objections that have been raised to postmillennialism.<br />This work is more like a textbook, and is definitely NOT light reading.  Having made those two points, however, this volume IS very readable for its scope and size.  For the scholar or the pastor, this book is a great investment providing a thorough explanation and solid defense of postmillennialism.	2002-01-24

Having counseled many couples in 20 years of pastoral ministry, I have read several books on marital, interpersonal relationships.  The authors present sound principles that are easy for persons to understand and to apply.  I had a few older favorites I would recommend to couples until reading this book -- now I have a new favorite to share instead!<br />One of the unique, most admirable qualities of this work is that it is very helpful to persons regardless of their marital status.  A single individual will find it helpful for insight during dating. A person who is engaged will find it helpful in identifying issues that are sure to arise within marriage.  A newlywed will find it helpful in responding to the major adjustments of sharing his/her life with another person.  A person who has been married for several years will find it helpful in understanding how a marriage deepens and grows over the course of time.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to enhance the relationship with his/her &quot;significant other.&quot;  The Parrotts also have video tapes available to use in a seminar or as part of pre-marital or post-marital counseling.

In his work &quot;End Times Fiction&quot;, Gary DeMar responds to the specific beliefs promoted in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series.  In this book, DeMar responds more extensively to the general beliefs of dispensational premillennialism.  Before going any further I must add that a good understanding of dispensational eschatology is a pre-requisite for reading this book.  If one needs a primer on eschatology, this work ISN'T it.  If a person, however, needs a good Scriptural assessment of the amazingly popular dispensational eschatology, then this book is the absolute best!<br />DeMar's volume is annotated enough to be respectable to the average scholar, yet straightforward enough to be readable to the average student. He is thorough, yet concise.  Even for persons who may not hold a preterist viewpoint, this book is a classic critique that no theological bookshelf should be lacking.<br />DeMar explores all the hot end-times themes, including the rapture, the great tribulation, the nation of Israel, the &quot;seventy weeks&quot; of Daniel, the antichrist, the dragon, the beast, the mark of the beast, the man of lawlessness, mystery babylon, the battle of Armageddon, and the &quot;day of the Lord.&quot;<br />I have a very high regard for the Bible, believing it is God's inerrant word and MUST be allowed to speak for itself.  I am very pleased with the way DeMar has simply sought to interpret what the Scriptures say, rather than trying to fit them into a preconceived system as so many other persons have done.<br />Get it!  Read it!  It will be money well-spent.	2002-01-16

This one is the best yet on the millennium.  I would have given it five stars, except for the mediocrity of the premillennial presentation.<br />Gentry, as usual, expresses himself very well and is very convincing, both in his own essay as well as in his responses.  Strimple, considering the limitations of this work, does a fine job of covering various Scriptures that address the amillennialist position.  The worst essay of the three is penned by Blaising, who takes entirely too many pages to explain the premillennial stance.  He gets bogged down in the history of premillennialism, and then is so technical in the actual presentation of his own view that he is very tough to follow.  The reader comes away scratching his/her head wondering what in the world did Blaising actually say!  Premillennialism, however, is so commonplace that it requires the least explanation of the three positions.<br />Bock provides a very cordial, conciliatory conclusion, touching upon points that are crucial to formulating one's own view of Revelation 20:1-6.  I was rather surprised when he revealed his own position near the end of his essay, for I certainly did not detect it through his earlier remarks.<br />This book gives a great presentation of the postmillennial and amillennial views.  The presentation for premillennialism pales in comparison, but other readers may find Blaising's essay more helpful than I did.<br />Overall, this work is a good investment for anyone wanting to compare the three basic millennial views.	2002-01-09

I was also pleased with his conciliatory tone, especially manifest in his closing chapter.  He extends a hand of fellowship to non-dispensationalists who stand upon the authority of God's inerrant Word.<br />I really cannot identify any weaknesses in this book.  While there are certainly weaknesses in the dispensational position, Ryrie does a very thorough job of accurately describing this ever-popular theological viewpoint.

My rating is for the book as a whole, though my rating for each individual writer would differ.  As an editor, Pate makes a commendable effort to be fair and open-minded with the views differing from his own position.  If Pate had requested each author to respond to the criticism voiced by the others, this book would have been much more helpful.<br />The first writer is Kenneth Gentry, representing the Preterist view.  His work is the best presented of the four positions, worthy of five stars.  If anyone wants an very good explanation of the Preterist view in a nutshell, Gentry offers it here.<br />The second writer is Sam Hamstra, representing the Idealist view.  He is a bit wordy in his presentation, and comes across as rather dull. I give him three stars.<br />The third writer is Marvin Pate, representing the Progressive Dispensationalist view.  Ironically, his argument is the weakest and most difficult to understand of the four.  He appears to be seeking an interpretation that will have something for everyone, but sacrifices substance and clarity in the process.  What seems to be a combination of a preterist/futurist position is not appealing in the least.  I give him two stars.<br />The fourth writer is Robert Thomas, representing the Classic Dispensationalist view.  Thomas voices the usual mantra for this camp, claiming that his dispensational view is the only position that interprets Revelation literally. He then proceeds to explain the &quot;actual meaning&quot; of the various &quot;symbols&quot; described by the Apostle John!  Still, he does a commendable job of presenting a very brief summary of this very complicated viewpoint.  I give him four stars.<br />In summary, this book is more suitable for the college classroom than for the church congregation.  I would recommend it to a fellow pastor or theologian, but not to a layman.  Overall, it serves to refresh the memory of a person who has already determined his viewpoint, rather than to persuade the mind of a person who is still undecided.he memory of a person who has already determined his viewpoint, rather than to persuade the mind of a person who is still undecided.	2002-01-06

His book reads more like a compilation rather than a work expressing his own views.  In fact, he never clearly identifies what his own view is.  One would guess that he is a preterist, but he never articulates it. To Sproul's credit, he holds a very high view of the authority of Scripture.  He also tries to summarize accurately other viewpoints besides preterism.<br />Sproul's work is helpful for an overview of preterism... \\"The Last Days According to Jesus\\" is a book I would recommend for others to borrow, but not to buy.  Perhaps the greatest strength of this work is the additional credibility given to preterism by Sproul's integrity and prominence.	2002-01-03

This book is a keeper for any pastor or teacher wanting to understand an eschatology different than the popular dispensational premillennialism.  Ladd draws upon his extensive knowledge of Scripture and church history to define what he sees as the church's &quot;Blessed Hope.&quot;  Obviously, he does not see that hope as a secret rapture of the church before seven years of tribulation.  Ladd possesses a high view of the inspiration and authority of Scripture in this work.  I recommend his book highly.	2002-01-01

This book is a MUST READ for pastors and teachers alike who are more concerned about discovering what the Bible says about eschatology rather than what dispensational pre-millennialists say.  Gary DeMar in \\"End Times Fiction\\" provides a strong, biblically-based rebuttal to the views promoted by Tim LaHaye in his \\"Left Behind\\" series.  For several years, many Bible-believing Christians have thought the outlook of LaHaye and others is the only truly Scriptural position on the end times.  DeMar dispels this notion using biblical literalism and an equally high (if not higher) view of Scripture.  Hopefully this book will give more Christians the boldness to allow the Bible to speak for itself, rather than reading into the Bible an eschatology that is foreign to it.	2002-01-01
