I was hesitant at first when i bought this book but i am glad i bought it.The author does a great job in narrating the life and tribulations of Victoria's daughters.He analyses the political turmoil in which all the daughters were involved which gives the book a lot of interesting things to read.The author doesnt just tell us what is like to be a daughter of Queen Victoria but it relates to us what problems they faced with other royal families,how marriages were arranged and the feelings and emotions that everybody in that family felt.I found really interesting the author's descritption of William II,son of Queen Victoria eldest daughter,Vicky.He is described, basically, as a moron and a bully without any regard for his father and mother.The author tells us the rude manner in which he treated everyone in his family.Great book for a rainy night	2005-09-14

Great work by Mr Phillips.I have been reading a lot about the Crusades lately and this book is definetly a must for everyone wanting to understand what happened in Constantinople during those times.Mr Phillips is a master at narrating the events and great at explaining the factors and consequences of the events of this fourth crusade.His narrative is clear and well presented to the reader.I liked, in particular, his description of the places in Constantinople and the political plots that derived from the sack of the city.For example he explains the consequences for pope Innocent III and the consequences for the rest of the Holy Lands and why another crusade was worthless.Magnificent book!!	2005-09-10

This is one of those books that i called \\"walking with a good friend book\\". What i mean is that when you read this book, it is so well written and so informative and so true that it feels that you are walking with a good friend who is talking to you about a subject in which he is an expert.The author is magnificent when explaining the political situation in Iran.Her approach is very simple but very informative since she is not in the business of predicting the conditions in Iran,just to give the reader a taste of what's going on in Iran and what the people in Iran are thinking.I truly enjoy this book as i was looking to understand and learn more about a country so difficult to understand.Truly a magnifivent work!!	2005-08-22

Once in a while you read a book that really feels like the author is walking next to you while explaining so easily a topic that you dont know much about.But at the end of the walk you feel like you know everything there is to know about that subject.That's how i felt with the author of this book.Mr Kinzer explains the political situation in Turkey so easily and with great narrative and insight.He also talks about his conversations with people he met on the streets, with politicians in high offices and with kids down the street.In this conversations you get the inside track of what people in Turkey are thinking.He addresses every major topic in Turkey during the 20th century like the Kurdish War, Turkey's relationship with Greece and the Army's intervention in politics in Turkey.Great Book!!	2005-08-11

The first time i read about The Grand Armee's adventure into Russia was just a chapter in a great book by Erik Durschmid called The Weather Factor.In this book, the problems and tribulations of Napoleon's army was explained.But Mr Zamoyski takes it to a whole new level.He relates in every detail the inmense obstacles Napoleon had to hurdle in order to get to Moscow and then the humiliating retreat into France. I also like the fact that Mr Zamoyski doesnt use too many military terms to explain the strategies of both armies.His account is very clear and easy to follow.His account of Tsar Alexander was very truthful and sincere,describing Alexander as he was,a wimp when facing Napoleon,at least during this campaign. I also enjoyed the pictures that are in the book which gives you a very good idea of all the problems the french army had to face plus it puts a face in the middle of so much tragedy..........great book!!!	2005-07-13

Mr Beevor explains every aspect and every faction of the war.He explains in basic terms what was the agenda of every political party and political group in Spain.He also does a very good job explaining the strategies and tactics of both sides.Altough his narrative is a little dry for me,he gets the main points across.If you want an introduction to the spanish civil war this is your book.	2004-12-02

When i bought this book i was very curious as to what i should expect from it.I was raised a catholic but i no longer practice the catholic faith and i have never encounter or talked to a mormon in my life so i thought i was going to be impartial with this book.I think Mr Krakauer did a terrific job in researching this job and his narrative is excellent.He tells the story pointing out his sources and with exactitude towards the truth.If he had any intentions as to debunk the Mormon Faith, i certainly never saw it.In other words, it is my opinion that Mr Krakauer's work is very well presented and rationale.The book  is very interesting and i consider it a page turner.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand what's going on in the Mormon Faith and who wants to know mora about the history of that faith and the state of Utah...Kudos to Mr Krakauer	2004-11-21

It's been a while since i read such a poor work like this one.I had my hopes when i started reading this book.But as i read it,i realized the author doesnt care about the reader because he never explains anything.He never explains who's who, what's what.He just describes what he's seeing but without troubling himself with explaining the reader important facts necesarry to understand.His narrative is dull and,simply put it,boring.It makes you wonder if the author was being punished and writing this book was his punishment.I never really understood what was going on in Spain at that time,nor did the author made any effort to explain it to you.I had to stop reading it at page 198 and then i tossed the book.I realized that explaining the different situations and turmoils of the Spanish Civil war is difficult but Mr Thomas just makes it more confusing.Right now i am reading Anthony Beevor's Spanish Civil War and,altough i am just on page 54, the book is good and with good and simple explanations as to what really happen in that war.Dont even bother with Mr Thomas' book.	2004-11-01

At times i felt like i was reading a gossip column on a supermarket tabloid.Mr Hibbert wastes too many chapters on things like her servants, dinner parties and the sort.The book is too tight since most of the times it covers the Queen's opinion of non-important things.	2003-05-31

My purpose in reading this book was very simple: i wanted to have an idea on one of the most famous kings in french history and i wasnt dissapointed. The author makes  an interesting accounting of Louis XIV.It covers important areas like major constructions ordered by Louis and his political struggles with other european nations. It is interesting the way the author explains Louis relationship with some of his family members like his oldest son and his oldest grand son, the King of Spain,Philip V.On the other hand, Mr Dunlop uses  way too many french words and sentences.This is annoying because you are left trying to make sense out of what was said and it's relation with the rest of the paragraph.Also, the author dedicates too much pages to Louis desire for architecture and construction.He gaves too many details that are not that necesary when you are talking about a very prominenet and influential king as Louis XIV.In short, it is a very good book for someone who is beginning to get interested in the matter.	2003-03-29

Mr Carroll used the first 25-30 pages to just talk about his life.I thought that the book was going to get better but it didnt.Mr Carroll keeps talking about his childhood, his teenage years and adulthood while mentioning the history of anti-semitisn once in a while.The book is certainly very dull and boring.It is also very hard to read because everytime Mr Carroll start to talk about history, he almost inmediatly deviates into his own insights and life. The book is certainly too long because Mr Carroll makes it long.	2003-02-26

Mr Tefertiller's book is by far,one of the most accurate books on Wyatt Earp's life.Without any prejudice, Mr Tefertiller presents facts,reports,paper articles and all sorts of sources of information which makes the book a fascinating journey thru Earp's life.I was surprised by the enormous information Mr Tefertiller brings about Wyatt Earp&quot;s last days in California.This book is a must for ,not only Wyatt Earp's followers but for Old West in general.	2002-09-14
