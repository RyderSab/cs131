I love this trilogy. The first fantasy series I've ever read and now I am hooked on fantasy. Anne Bishop has combined all the things I love most about fiction in these stories; Romance, adventure, fantasy, humor and suspense. The characters are unforgettable long after you put the books down. There are so many memorable moments that pull at your heart. Who else is going to create a Hell in which you actually find yourself wishing you were in it. I found myself wishing Saeten and his sons were my own father and brother. I've read these books at least 3 times and still when I reread them I'm impressed. The four stars are because I fell in love with so many characters and felt that any of them could carry their own stories. So there should be more Black jewel stories.    I read these books several years ago and have reread them several times since. My favorite is the first book Daughter of the Blood. I was drawn into the story very easily and hated to see it end. That's the sign of a good book. What I liked most about all the stories is the relationship between Saetan and his sons. I was touched at how tender and caring a father he was and found myself wishing I had those kinds of relationships in my own life. If people like these characters populated the world we would be a lot better off.     I even loved the dark theme of the novels though I usually like and read upbeat romances. There is a romance in the story but it is very subtle and for me could have been stronger but this is a fantasy novel so I accept that.     My one complaint is that there were some consistency issues with the series. At the beginning Saetan called his son \\"Namesake\\" but it was dropped in latter books.   There are so many tender and funny moments that you have to let it slide.     I loved these stories but by the end they lose some of their steam. Still I found myself wishing for another story and found some satisfaction with one of her other novels which is a prequel to this \\"The invisibleRing.\\" SO if you like these books you will love that one too.

I recently picked it up and started reading it again one night and could not bring myself to put it down. It was still fresh and funny the second time around. I don't understand the other reviews that say it is not funny or who compare it to Sandra Hill. Thank God it is not as bad as Sandra Hill who I just don't get. I can see her lame jokes coming a mile away. <BR>Is Tempted laugh out loud funny? No. but then are you looking for romance authors or comics? <BR>I thought the characters were fresh and original. I realy liked Mike and No Account. Theirs was a match made in heaven if ever there was one. No one is more deserving of love and happiness that these two characters and just seeing them learn to love and trust each other is worth reading about.  <br />As for the other two writers that another reviewer spoke of, well Sandra Hill I tried to read two of her novels and both were wall bangers that I never finished. And the same fate happened to Dara Joy. They just didn't appeal to my sense of humor and to be honest I didn't know they were trying to be funny. I just thought their characters were mentally challenged or dumb or something. <BR>But I always say whenever you try hard to be funny usually all the audience sees is the try and not the funny.	2003-03-25

I am not a crazy regency fan, but this book is so smart and charming that I have to say it almost makes me a believer. I say almost because I know that this is the exception that proves the rule. This rake and this spinster dont follow the unwritten regency rules of acting stupid so they come across very refreshingly. The witty dialogue and engaging plot that grows from the characters and not plot device are a breath of fresh air. There is no formula here just wonderful characters that you wish you could always read about. If only other regency writers would take note.	2002-08-05

I loved it to the very last page. Not a stickler for all that regency historical accuracy...I had no problems with these characters. In fact I'm glad they weren't too stuck in their time. This is a fairy tale. I knew that the minute I first met Alain. Who but prince charming could be so wonderfully perfect? Surely we all read to escape our real lives. So why be disappointed when a fiction novel turns out be... well fictitious? <br />The problem with romance enthusiasts is that they start taking it too seriously. It goes against everything that romance is about. I don't read for a history lesson. That's what history books are for. I read for pleasure. And this novel pleased me very much. <br />This was my first by this novelist but it wont is my last. The characters didn't act like typical romance novel characters and believe me that am a great compliment. When we start knowing everything a silly chit in a novel is expected to do then we are lost. The choices Katherine made blew me away because they were so unregency like. There are none of those silly misunderstandings none of the stupid plot devices that could be easily solved if only the characters were not too stupid to live. NO these characters were smart and unique and too smart to care that they aren't regency. They could exist anywhere at any time. That's what makes this the perfect fantasy.	2002-08-05

The characters were carbon coppies of all her previous novels but without all the nice touches. Maybe I am being hard on this book. But I couldn't finish it. after the scene where marcus and that girl meet I was really turned off. The dialogue was just too formal and stiff. Formal maybe good but stiff and strained is not. The characters were boring and I had the been there done that feeling all while I read it. I found myself skipping all discription and just reading the dialogue because the pace was so slow. But the dialogue was no better. Finally I (...) cut to the chase. Only there was no chase. Just more of the same pointless mindless dialogue. <br />I usually like Amanda Quick. Sometimes her stories really hit the spot. Not this one. It was a wall banger. Did I mention the whole premis is weak?  I just couldn't suspend disbelief for this one. So I tossed it for a julie garwood. <br />Like I said Mistress? Miss this!!	2001-12-07

I don't hate this book but it's nothing to write home about. In fact i've had it for several weeks and still havent finished reading it. It just doesn't hold my attention like some of my favorites. You know that feeling you get when you read a really good book? You just cant put it down. You cant sleep because you have to finish it tonight? I just dont get that feeling. But maybe it's only the first novel. I havent finished it yet.<br />I just cant seem to care over much about these perfect characters who can do no wrong. I don't relate to them in any way. Their lives seem too perfect to me. They are so happy and in love from the start where does the book have to go? I dont want to spoil it for anyone and I doubt that I could since I am not even done reading it yet, but the book just seems too polished. It's a nice read to distract yourself while doing other stuff. In fact I've read several other better novels between reading chapters of this book. I picked up Robin Schone's \\" the lady's tutor\\" and couldn't put it down, also I read \\"Hawk's way the virgin groom\\" and couldn't put it down. Then there was \\"Every wish fulfilled\\" not great but still more engrosing than this. <br />Every body else seems to love this novel but I just don't know why. I mean it is perfect. Too perfect. It's all plot and no passion. It's like a diamond, perfect brilliante, and cold.	2001-12-02

I wanted to see if he practiced what he preached so to speak. Well I was rewarded with a heck of a good read. I was really left wondering why I had never heard of him before. This novel is really great. <br />For me it is the characters. Their voices are so strong and vibrant. I liked every one. And not a one of them sounds the same. The plot was great too but the characters really make the book. I love them. <br />When I finished this book I went right back to &quot;on writing&quot; and read it again.

This was a good story don't get me wrong but it could have been better. Something is missing here. It just doesn't get four stars from me. I think her plots are too formulaic. Too much purple prose. Too much drama where there need not be. But really the purple prose is annoying. Too many stupid names for men and womens you know whats ;-) Also the characters could have been a little smarter.

The beginning was sort of slow for my tastes and i never really understood all the dynamics at work here. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that this is a sequal. Some character motivation was unclear but otherwise i loved these characters. Isobel and Gilmour really belong together. I loved his secret. You will too. This is not your typical formula romance. It jumps out of the box. <BR>But I must say the ending left something to be desired and that's all i'm gonna say!! Buy this and see for yourself!!	2001-11-19

My one complaint is that it should have been longer. That way we could have been with the characters more and watched them learn about each other. But it is still good.

But all Samantha James novels leave me feeling that she could have done more. There is a sweet tender love story here but for me it just wasn't sweet or tender enough. It was memorable though. There just wasn't any wicked sutff in it. When you name a novel his wicked ways the Hero should have some wicked ways about him. This should have been called his wicked deed or something. it is a good read. <br />Oh, by the way, the dialogue was bad. I mean the characters said everything twice. e.g. &quot;i don't know&quot; &quot;i don't konw&quot; It really became distracting. But still i liked these people and their love story enough to recomend it.	2001-11-19

A lot of people don't like the dark aspect of the husband but that is really blown out of proportion. Ive seen much worse behavior from a hero or two. Anyway the story was filling. That is the only way i could describe it. Not really romantic but satisfying all the same. Ginny was annoying sometimes but I still liked her. It's one of \\"those cold winter nights\\" kind of books. Makes you feel toasty.<br /><br />Update 2013:<br />After all these years I still remember this book as one of my favorites. I love long novels that take you through many emotions and ups and downs. But I also understand why some people hate this novel, it's not your typical historical romance with more erotic scenes than sense. This story actually shows the sometimes ugly side of love and marriage. So if you like trashy erotic novels that titillate this may not be for you.	2001-11-08

This is nothing like Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. It does not have the spirite or the heart of those two books. For years I tried to figure out what was wrong with me that I should not love such  a classic. But now that I am more mature and a more seasoned reader; ...It just is not to my taste. Sometimes I like books that others do not and sometimes others like books that I dont. This book lacks the hope and sense of awe for life that I desire in a novel. For me the hero and herroine must be worthy of my time and attention. Something good in them must prevail. That just doesn't happen here. This story is really sad because it is a love story writen by a woman who never know what it was like to love and be loved in return. IF she had she would never have writen this abusive version of love. But you know as well as i do that some women truely belive that abuse is love. So like I say to each his own.<br /><br />P.S. Read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall By Ann Bronte instead. It shows the real face of an abusive relationship with a happy ending. Her characters are realistic and true heros of their lives.	2001-10-26

I really loved every word of it. It was warm, romantic, charming, sexy fun from start to finish. I wish I had the courage and spirit of Amanda. I think she is just plucky. And Jack!!! I adore him. This couple is one of my all time favorites. Their story is so sweet and innocent somehow in spite of that fact that it is also so spicey. Their relationship is very hot. There is simply no other way to put it. They just burn up the pages. The only fault the book has is the silly plot twist near the end. I suspect that the book was a little shortish so she stretched it out here. Asside from that the book is perfect. I have to admit it had me blushing for a long time. I must have blushed all the way home from work on the bus. But it was worth it.<br /> After this book Lisa Kleypas became an instant buy for me and I have never been disappointed with her yet. Even her early novels are good. Not great but still you can see where she was going. In Suddenly You she got there.<br /> What more can I say, this book is perfect. I wish every book could draw you into it's world and hold you within from page one. Once Amanda and Jack meet the sparks fly and they don't stop until the very last page. Lisa is very good at what she does. She turns on the heat and lets it slowly simmer to a boil throughout the story. And when it boils you only want more.	2001-09-07

They really tell you what there is to like and not like about a story from a different point of view. So I have to say that I somewhat agree with be bad reviews of this book. The ending was not what I expected. That part of the plot she could have left out. Also there were a few words in the novel that just felt out of place, but since Karen Robards is a historical writer as well, I will give her a pass. I really loved this book however. It was great. The few criticisms I have don't take away from this great story one bit. It was romantic and suspenseful and fun. Sure Johnny was a stereotype right out of Dirty Dancing or Grease, but if you like those stories then youll love this one too. The Four stars is only because of the ending where I detect a bit of author meddling. I won't give it away except to say that it was very convenient. Otherwise the book was just plain fun and I was sad when it was over.	2001-07-30

I know i love Sandra Brown and just about everything she writes but not this one. Maybe it is because I see a little too much of Sage in myself or myself in Sage. OR maybe I was just sick of the Tylers by this point. I suspect the former though. I just see all those spoiled traites in myself and I don't like them in me so I sure as heck cant stand them in someone else. Plus when I put myself in Sages boots I just felt that we deserved a better story. I mean damn , who wants to fall in love, make love for the first time, and get pregnant all in the course of a few months?. The plot was just too predictable this time. Maybe since I read The Texas trilogy all in one sitting, by the time i got to book three the charm had just worn off.  I just didn't like the characters, plain and simple. O.K. the love scenes were good but hey this is Sandra Brown we're talking about here. Whatever it is Sage only gets 3 on account of Sandra Browns reputation.	2001-07-11

After the night is tawdry and silly and doesn't really pass for a good romance or a good mystery. What it does pass for is fun. I stayed up late into the night reading it and I laughed at the silly parts, cried at the touching parts that I could relate to, and was shocked at the shocking parts. And I liked the love scenes. That's why I bought this book. I had read an excerpt of the main love scene somewhere on the net. It whetted my appetite. So I guess I am just like a Devlin.  I like trashy things. Sure the hero was annoying. Sure the Heroine was simple. Sure the mystery was non existent. It was good ol' fashioned fun I was after and that's what it delivered. Yes the ending was rushed but to tell the truth there was really nothing else left to say. So why not end it? Just like Faith, by that point I was spent anyway. As for Gray, he was a jerk. Just like a Devlin jerks must be my weakness. My only real complaint is that the story could have had a little more depth. Show more of the other characters. Don't just brush past them. Maybe that is what the bad reviews are all about. They just wanted a little more.	2001-07-11

I am so tired of writing bad reviews, you'd think that the authors would be tired of writing bad novels. In all fairness this book was written 10 years ago. Maybe back then it did pass for good writing. I really don't know even how to review this novel since I only got to page 165. After that I just gave up. It was just that bad. Really at about page 5  I wanted to hit the wall with it but I decided to give it a chance because I had read the Elusive Flame and sort of liked it even though it took a while to get going. But this one never got going. It just went nowhere very painfully slowly.  The characters were more like caricatures. The hero just wants sex at first sight of the beauty. She in turn wants the same thing although she doesn't know what it is called that she is feeling (lust).  Then the whole farce of an escape followed by wedding was all I could take. Only a fool couldn't see where the story was going from there, and that's really being unkind to fools.  This story is way too long.  Cut it about 200-300 pages and maybe it will be readable. As it was I found myself skipping pages and pages of unneeded description and narration.  All in all, the blurb on the back of the book sounds good but the writing just doesn't live up.     Two stars is really being kind on my part. I paid full price for this novel unlike another reviewer who merely borrowed it from a library. I wish i had saved my money and done the same thing. I know a lot of people love this novel. Some people even love tripe. The world is diverse.	2001-07-06

Then as I got older and began to like to read, I discovered what was inside that cover and the rest was history. I love it. It was a great read from start to finish. Over the years every member of our house has consulted it to plunder its wisdom. I don't know much about astrology nor do I believe in it, but the writing style is what keeps me coming back for more. I love it's whimsical spirit and wisdom. The bits of original poetry are wonderful and inspiring. Of a rainy evening you could do worse than to sit down with this one. There are no boring parts, just charming anecdotes about love and relationships. You will enjoy reading about every sign and combination trying to glimpse descriptions of yourself or of people you know. I just don't have a bad thing to say about this book except that it is too short. I wish there were more signs in the zodiac just to read what Linda Goodman has to say about them.  Her other books are good too but this one is definitely the keeper of them all.	2001-07-02

It was too long on mundane discription and too short on plot. And the liberties that the author takes with common sense is shameful. I won't give away what little plot there is except to say that it was unbelievable especially the ending. I wanted to throw the book against the wall on that susposedly dramatic scene. It was so soap opera melodrama. If you like to read books just to see how bad they can get than do buy this one. It started out with so much potential but took the dreaded easy slide into clich`e ville.     p.s. just for the record the secondary characters of Jack and Charlotte are the best thing here. Too bad they don't have a book of their own.	2001-07-02

I bought this book because of the reviews here on amazon. I must say that they are a bit misleading. This is not a romance but a love story. And a bad love story at that. I just didn't believe these characterd from jump street. I read chapter after chapter waiting for something to happen with them but it never did. 300 plus pages of pure fluff. Nothing happens in this story and the little that does pass for plot was predictable and clich`e. If you want to read a good book about deafness read Sandra Browns' Eloquent silence. It demonstrates what good writing is all about. Really i think this book would not have been so bad if were about 100 pages shorter.	2001-07-02
