US	52092680	R1UG873FW0FPXT	0515119784	417080124	Range of Motion	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Fantastic and moving	This is one of the few books that have brought me to tears... tears rolling down my face, dripping across my nose and onto my pillow.  Elizabeth Berg never handles a situation like you'd think it would (or probably should) be; she handles it in the way in which it would truly happen.  What would I really think if my husband were in a coma?  No really, what would I be THINKING?  It's an incredibly complicated concept, even more heart-wrenching than other books about actual death that I've read.  She has a wonderful, intimate way of bringing the same hurt, confusion and intensity of emotions her characters experience into the mind and heart of her readers.  It's a very genuine thing that keeps me reading her stories with open ears.	2004-03-09

Caleb and April are getting married in a chapel/hotel that's rumored to be haunted, which pales in importance next to the baggage that haunts their hastily-planned wedding... April's family can't figure out why she's broken things off with her ex-boyfriend whom they all loved, her father had to beg her out of just saying her vows in front of the justice-of-the-peace, and her grandmother is so distraught that the ceremony isn't taking place in a church that she arrives early to hang a crucifix in the chapel.  At the same time another story is taking place in suite thirty-three where an argument between a husband and wife turns deadly.  Ansay tenderly draws a line between these two stories in a way that can be startling, but not disturbing.<br />Ansay brings back the art of story-telling in such masterful way.  With so much emphasis being placed on an author's verbal flair these days, it seems we've forgotten what a truly good story is.  Midnight Champagne encompasses both these talents in a remarkable way.  Ansay's explorations of what love is and what it means in a marriage is very courageous, but expressed so tenderly... that love does not eliminate loneliness, but often creates it.  She places Chekhov's astounding quote at the very beginning of her book, \\"If you fear loneliness, then marriage is not for you.\\"  It's a bold statement that sets the pace for this very bold story.	2004-01-29
US	52092680	R2VYX7N7N9KPX3	0385318782	405219559	Talk Before Sleep	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Written in classic Berg style	In `Talk Before Sleep' Elizabeth Berg displays the dynamics of the female friendship in such a moving and realistic way that this could be a true story, only it's not.  Berg explains that she wrote the story to help sort out her experiences during her own friend's death, and this connection between herself and her characters keeps them real and alive.  You will not often find a book in which the characters so confidently propel the story forward.<br />Ruth is dying of caner, it's plain and simple.  Though she toys with the idea of `curing' herself, it's pretty apparent that she will be leaving her friends before she should have to.  But like so many of Berg's books, this story is really about  Ann, Ruth's maternally-inclined friend, who temporarily sacrifices her husband and daughter to care for Ruth in her home.  While Ann is waiting on Ruth hand and foot (emotionally, physically and medically) there is plenty of time for flashbacks that take the reader through the women's friendship; through divorces and children and all the messy stuff that life is made of.  While Ruth's other friends also play intricate parts in the story, the focus really is on Ann and what she will choose to retain from her friendship with Ruth and this phase of her life.<br />Even though the subject is somewhat grim, I enjoyed reading this book.  One thing that is always consistent in Berg's writing is that she doesn't skip over the less-attractive parts of the human nature, so when you're reading you find yourself easily relating to one or more of her characters.  Reading is so often such a solitary thing, but when it becomes interactive it stays with you.	2003-12-12

The reason I love Elizabeth Berg is because she has that unique talent for taking a plot that sounds clich, and pulling the truth out of it, line by line, till my preconceived notions are completely shattered.  In `Never Change' we  meet Myra Lipinski, who seems to have finally resigned herself to a life alone, finding comfort in its advantages and resignation in its shortcomings.  She was the girl who sat in the hall selling prom tickets, who held secret admiration for Chip Reardon, popular football player and steady boyfriend to equally-popular Diann.  Years slide by and Myra is settled into her career as a home-care nurse when Chip appears again... this time as a brain tumor patient who is spending his dying days with dignity instead of pursuing aggressive treatment.  This could read like a soap opera, especially when Diann comes back to help care for Chip and they all end up living together in Myra's two-bedroom home.  But Berg is more intelligent than that.  She digs in deep and finds what it is about people that bring and keep them together.  Every character is challenged, every topic gently peeled and exposed and consumed.  It's beautiful and real and anything but ordinary.	2003-09-01

Young readers will have a great time helping Ned look for Pistachio through twenty-eight pages of colorful, collage-style illustrations.  <br />\\"Of course you know it's not much fun<BR>To lose a cat upon page ONE.\\"<br />The rhyme and rhythem in this book make it perfect for reading out-loud while the kids search the page for Pistachio.  They'll find him popping out of a cupboard door, disguised as a castle guard or camelphloged in a monkeys cage.  Of course Ned never seems to see him and enlists the help of a courtly queen, a memory-challenged old man and a faithful horse (who eventually gives up on page twenty-six).

Samantha (Sam) Morrow is so hurt when her husband leaves her and her pre-teen son Travis that she sends herself into a whirling dervish to correct what must be `wrong' with her.  But (don't worry) this isn't a story about her `finding herself', it's about her remembering herself, and Berg pinpoints that complex set of values and emotions with reassuring clarity.  You don't have to stare off into space and fiddle with your bookmark to find the deeper meaning between these lines... it's all right there in front of you, softly spoken yet boldly accurate.  If you like stories that delve right into the messy lives of real people, then you will truly appreciate this book.  You may also enjoy `Blue Shoe' by Anne Lamott.	2003-06-19

The tone of this W.W.II drama is lyrical, wistful and bold, and her characters bend and sway in the nostalgia she so openly releases.  It is narrated by Gwen Davis a single 30-something horticulturist who joins the war effort by volunteering to lead a group of girls in growing potatoes on a deserted estate in the English countryside.   Used to working in a solitary lab environment, Gwen has to face her shyness and lack of self-confidence as she forms her relationships with the girls in her crew.  Her amateur gardeners are young and energetic and would rather be flirting with the soldiers who are also stationed at the estate while awaiting deployment.  One of the girls, however, is different...  Jane.  Since Jane's fianc√© has been declared missing in action she's been slowing fading away, just barely holding onto that fragile thread of hope.  Jane and Gwen befriend one another, as well as two of the soldiers staying in the estate house.  Then Gwen finds the best companion of all... a secret garden hidden within the grounds.  With her knowledge of horticulture and some research into the inhabitants of the estate, Gwen beings to piece together the story the garden has to tell... and finds that it is telling her story as well.  <br />If someone would've told me that I'd learn quite a lot about gardening techniques while reading this book, I might have passed it up, because I wouldn't have realized that there is a beautiful and sensitive language gardens can speak.  I think any reader who enjoys creative expression will find they can relate to this story.  Humphreys delivers her tale with perfect timing, swiftly wrapping-up after the climax, yet leaving just enough loose threads to keep you thinking about the characters long after the last page has been turned.	2003-04-18

When I first picked up this book, I began to read it with my safety net of doubt firmly in place.  Most of the biblical fiction I've encountered over the years have been full of stiff dialog or narrowly researched story lines that lose the readers interest in it's quest to drive home a moral or spiritual point.  This one is different.<br />Rivers tossed that bad habit of stiff dialog out the window when she wove together this partly fictional account of Ruth, Naomi and Boaz. As one of my favorite stories since I was a little girl, it was so warming to read more about Ruth, and I was delighted that Rivers kept her character true to her original, biblical presentation.  She didn't try to remind us that Ruth was a girl like any of the rest of us, by pointing out her flaws or catching her in her weak moments.  Instead she portrays her as a strong, faithful, trusting woman whose faith in God matures as she makes her new life with her mother-in-law after her husband dies.  Rivers understanding and research of biblical culture and customs more fully explains the impact of Ruth leaving her family to move back to Naomi's home town, this enlightenment brings even more meaning to a story I assumed I already completely grasped.  <br />Rivers also adds a great deal of humor in her character's dialog and actions.  She gives the reader a great visua,l which is especially important when we already know the basic outline and outcome of the story.  <br />I fully recommend this book to anyone who has read the story of Ruth and Boaz a hundred times and still finds themselves thinking about the details we might never know the full truth of.	2003-04-15

This is a very funny, very engaging story.  Yes, it's true, there's no deeper meaning or hidden agenda, but the concentration of the comedy and the unique way in which it is presented is what makes the story so enjoyable.  Webb doesn't clutter up the story line with descriptive narrative.  Instead, he focuses on the dialog that makes up everyday life and omits nearly everything but the bare essentials. This keeps the story strong and consistent and anything but boring.<br />Colin Ware is an English artist who finds himself in the rural town of New Cardiff, Vermont after Vera breaks his heart by marrying someone else.  Mandy Martin is a depressed, nursing home aid who is obsessed with the good times high school gave her.  Colin and Mandy begin a sweet little relationship and all is going along quite nicely... till Vera shows up.  Webb makes it impossible for the reader to feel anything but pride and sympathy for Colin and his sense of humor in character interaction is priceless.  I will read this book over and over... it is a gem.	2003-03-24

In \\"The Adventures of Miles and Isabel\\", Tom Gilling brings back the classic story of fated romance, but without any of the frivolous swooning our twenty-first century culture prefers to do without.  This love story is set in the pre-aviation era of the 1850's and 60's... only it's not so much about the love between a boy and a girl as it is between a boy and a girl and their obsession with flight.<br />Miles is an intelligent, restless boy who is bursting with the unwavering confidence of his own ideals.  He is the only son of Eliza McGinty, famed Australian stage actress, who went into labor with him during her controversial rendition of Hamlet.  Isabel is an independent young lady who is submissive to nothing but fate.  She is very much like her progressive and headstrong mother, Lousia Dowling, who was in the audience the night Eliza fell into labor with Miles.  In a manner only providence can predict, Louisa's own contractions begin as she witnesses Eliza's laboring... and so Miles and Isabel enter the world.<br />The first two-thirds of this book set-up the inevitable meeting of the two young characters.  Isabel is taken for a brief, impromptu flight in a hot air balloon by Tobias Smith, the area's first aviation entrepreneur.  Several years later, Miles encounters a broken-down Mr. Smith who passes to him his personal journal full of notes and sketches of various flying machines.  This is the beginning of  a series of what some skeptics might call `coincidences', but what the rest of us will firmly believe is `fate' by the time the story is finished.  <br />Gilling displays a commendable amount of research in this book.  His grasp of the historical facts keep the story strong and intact.  The engaging dialog between his unique characters is one of the facets that keeps you glued to the page.  I highly recommend this book to any creative person.  It combines the perfect mix of history, human interest and fantasy that makes a book truly timeless.	2003-03-12

John Fulton explores the breakdown of the dysfunctional family so thoroughly and so intimately in this book that while I was reading I often felt the embarrassment of one who is caught snooping.  Steven Parker and his sister Jenny are caught in the downward spiral of their parents hopes and regrets about the lives they've chosen.  Living in the, primarily Mormon, society of Salt Lake City is making it difficult for Billy Parker, the father, to pass on his strong disbelief in God to his children.  Jenny makes friends with a girl on the cheerleading squad and begins memorizing the Ten Commandments, while Steven deals with the after-effects of being bullied by some rich neighborhood brats.  Mary Parker carries the financial burden of her husbands lack of work ethics and swears every time Billy goes a little nuts that she's taking the kids and leaving.<br />What captivated me about this story is the way that Fulton dissects this falling-out so carefully... taking the length of a book to narrate the couple of months it takes for this family's inevitable disintegration.  This kind of information gives birth to gossip in the real world, but here we get the whole, messy, painfully honest story.  While the ending did leave me feeling slightly depressed, it is also very realistic and, therefore, leaves that small crack of hope open.  This is a wonderful story written by an author who truly knows his characters.	2003-03-05

While there is no shortage of mind-stimulating poetry and literature for young kids these days, I still can't help but stand up and cheer for collections such as these.  I think that helping kids learn the entertainment and enjoyment side of reading is so crucial at this age, and this book fills that need perfectly.  McNaughton has a talent for giving you both the creeps and the giggles at the same time with his icky prose and imaginative illustrations.  <br />Are all these Silverstein-esque poems about monster's?  No, but they pretty much all appeal to the young readers sense of humor.  \\"Call a doctor/Call the vet!/I've just been bitten/By teacher's pet!\\"  The grossest one to read aloud would probably be \\"Ogre My Dead Body! (The Ogre's Song\\" which goes a little something like this, \\"An wen I needs a midnite snack,/Heer them hewmin bones go CRACK!/CRACK, CRACK, midnite snack,/Heer them hewmin bones go CRACK!\\"  OK, this might not make the best bed-time reading.

Or that a particular red ant supplies food to a caterpillar in exchange for its honeydew that they, in turn, eat?

The down-to-earth language and charming illustrations perfectly bring together education and entertainment.  <br />There are fourteen descriptive pairs of animals in this book, all with full-page illustrations, and a handy pronunciation key for sounding out some of the trickier names.  Just because it's informational, don't think you can't sit down and read this to your little one at a whim.  When read from cover to cover it makes a great little story with lots of room for discussion.  This would also make a great addition to any school library or classroom.	2003-02-23

William Wellnitz teaches a course called \\"Wizard Wellnitz\\" out of Augusta State University and this book is just a sampling of his nifty little tricks.  It would be perfect for home-schoolers, or even just kids in need of rainy-day activities.  Experiments range from as simple as cleaning a dirty penny to the more complex, such as using a battery to change a nail into a magnet.  There are also some really fun ones, like homemade slime.<br />The layout of this book will really appeal to kids, because each experiment is presented as a `magic trick'.  Each activity includes a `What You Need' list, `What To Do' (in easy-to-read steps), and an explanation of `What's Happening and Why'.  Another nice thing is that each experiment is left open-ended and an `Other Things to Try' section at the end of each activity encourages young minds to explore the subject further.  This section also gives special notes, such as \\"DO NOT PUT THE SLIME IN YOUR POCKET\\".  This guy really knows kids!<br />Contents include eleven units: (1)Rubbery and Gooey Things (2)Color  (3)Water  (4)Mass and Density  (5)Motion  (6)Properties of Air  (7)Sound  (8)Light  (9)Heat, Electricity and Magnets  (10)Fun With Foods  (11)Biology; a glossary; an introductory note to adults.

The classic theme of friendships that break the usual mold is revitalized in this story by Mary Elizabeth Hanson with quirky and emotion-filled illustrations by David Webber Merrell.<br />While the old man is enjoying taking his tiny little friend to the movies, the beach and even a whale-watching cruise,  the ever-skepital townspeople begin to whisper among themselves.  \\"He's knotted his noodle.\\"  It's true that they mean well, but  it seems that the townspeople would feel a bit more comfortable if they could actually see the pal the old man is chatting with.<br />This is a fun, fun book with a strong message about friendship that your kids will want you to read over and over.

If you read and enjoyed the first novel in this series (Confessions of a Shopaholic) then you'll probably enjoy this book too... because it's practically the same story over again.  Girl shops compulsively,  buries herself in debt,  contributes to a blunder that affects nearly everyone she knows within a 50 mile radius, blindly stumbles upon the solution that not only brings her success and recognition, but the affection of the one and only Luke Brandon.  Girl gets boy.  Girl saves day.<br />The first three chapters of this book were so monotonous I considering chucking the whole thing.  Kinsella's over-zealous reintroduction of our friend Becky crossed that gray line where humorous becomes annoying ridiculous.  She gives us page after page of Becky's inner ramblings, her shopping philosophies and her self-absorbed outlook on life.  I wanted to shout, \\"OK, I get it!\\"  Then, around the fiftieth page, the story finally takes off with a hilarious account of Becky and Luke's first weekend getaway where certain obstacles present themselves and pave the path for the rest of the book.  <br />After its awkward beginning, Kinsella's writing becomes clear, concise and downright funny.  While the overall theme of this story clearly mirror's her previous one,  I was still able to find myself laughing out loud at many of the scenarios.  The creation of such lovable characters should be considered an accomplishment, and I look forward to reading Becky's next adventures in Shopaholic Ties the Knot.	2003-02-16

The opening title page has a \\"To;\\" and \\"From:\\" slot in a red heart and the lines of the poem read like a greeting card.

Harvey (Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards (Awards))	Books	2	21	42	N	N	Talk about being blind-sided	I was about half-way through the reading of this book when I abruptly slapped it shut in order to protect my four-year-old son.  I thought I was reading him an educational story about a fireboat.  This is, after all, a picture book with all the elements intended to hook the interest of a very young audience (note:age category 4-8).  I was shocked to find graphic images portraying the September 11th tragedy.  There was absolutely no warning on the front or back covers that this was yet ANOTHER Sept. 11th book, and no summary of the content on the inside cover or copyright pages (the copyright information and summery of the story are barely readable on the very last page before back cover; the text written in squiggled, wave-like lines).  I thought it was simply a story about a fireboat.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.<br />This book is clearly designed for very young children.  The text is large and inviting, with the clever word play that kids enjoy.  The word big is printed very large, the word down slopes downward, the description of the George Washington Bridge is shaped into the gentle suspension of the bridges design, etc...  The illustrations take up the entire page and are very bright, colorful and, at times, beautifully abstract.  The writing style is simple and direct... The Harvey was the largest, fasted and shiniest fireboat of them all.  Were given a grand description of the fireboat and all its qualities, stuff our kids love learning about... like how many engines the boat ran on, mini-pics of the control dial, steering wheel and water pump, and what jobs the crew members had.  To make a long story short, the John J. Harvey becomes so out of date that it retires until 1995 when a group of friends buy, and restore the boat and float it back out on the Hudson River.  <br />Then whole book shifts gears with a dramatically empty, gray page where the tragedy of September 11th is announced in plain, white text.  The next page is a double-spread showing a bright blue sky, the two Twin Towers of The World Trade Center and two airplanes headed straight for them.  The text switches into a dramatic swell, Two airplanes crashed into the Twin Towers.  CRASHED, CRASHED, CRASHED into these two strong buildings.  The book goes on to assault young readers/listeners eyes with three more double-spread displays of fire and debris (one of the towers actually falling down) while the John J. Harvey heroically pumped water at site.  <br />I was horrified when I finally (in my sons absence of course) examined these pages.  Havent our kids seen enough of these graphic images on the television and in the newspapers?  In my opinion, this book used these images in order to grab the attention of young readers the same way that movie-makers use blood and gore to attract adult viewers.<br />Im of the opinion that children this young do not need such specific information about September 11th.  I wouldnt recommend this book to any child under the age of eight.  This really is an unfortunate circumstance, especially since so much heart, hard work, and good intention was involved... but this type of education really is a tragedy when you consider that the intended audience is still afraid of monsters under their bed and the boogie man in the closet.	2003-02-11

It is told from the point-of-view of the young girl who rescues the lizard from the dryer (after it escaped from the washer of course) and then can't seem to shake it lose.  The illustrations are funny and eye-catching with lots of detail to absorb after the text is read.  Keep an eye out for that sneaky reptile... he's good at hiding.<br />The author also explores the emotions involved in moving away from a familier home and saying goodbye to family.  She mixes these details in with the humor of the storyline fairly well, although I tend to feel that kids don't appreciate being tricked into reading a self-help book.  This book is targeted for ages 9-12, but it seemed more appropriate for my four-year-old son (who thoroughly enjoyed it by the way).	2003-02-08

This creative piece of fiction by Nicholson Baker is really more than just that.  Baker's main character, Emmett, runs a parallel, rural life not unlike the authors own.  Baker throws all his own feelings about the tiny things around him and their vast impact on his life into his character's daily ritual.  It all starts out with the flare of a match.  \\"Good Morning, it's 4:45 a.m.\\"<br />If you think an ordinary man with an ordinary life has nothing to say at four o'clock in the morning, you couldn't be more off-base.  While sitting in the dark and sipping hot coffee, Emmett explores everything from the nuisance of having a hole in his bedtime sock, to the perplexity of life \\"passing him by\\".  The beauty of this book is that Baker takes these thoughts and pushes them one step further, bringing the eating habits of a pet duck or a root beer-stained brief case full circle.  This kind of writing always bring validation to our normal lives.<br />\\"I've just ridden my tricycle, gone to school, greased my bearings, gotten a job, gotten married, had children, and here I am.\\"<br />Each chapter starts out with Emmett's familiar greeting, a quick, usually comical, quibble of his morning run-down, and then a thoughtful stream of whatever is on the top of his mind.  Whether he reminisces about his youth or contemplates the lives of chimney sweeps, he wraps each section up in a pointedly keen observation about the meaning of these things in life.<br />While this book is categorized as a `novel' I find it really hard to thing of in such a way.  If it weren't for the fictional name of the character I would've just assumed this was a personal memoir.  Also, besides the message that the everyday coming's and going's of our lives make up who we are, I felt this book didn't carry a very strong theme.  I fully believe in Bakers underlying philosophy, but was hoping that there would be some kind of a story line to tie all these vignettes together (there were a couple of chapters where Emmett battles an illness that I thought would lead to something, but it never did).  Even so, there's so much to enjoy in this book.  Anyone who's raised a family, gotten married, or lived an `ordinary' life would thoroughly enjoy reading this.	2003-02-08

I picked this book up because I wanted to read the story before I saw the movie, but I now know that I never want to tarnish the beauty of this experience by watching Hollywood's theatrical version.  Cunningham brilliantly paints a picture of one day in the lives of three different women in three different era's.  First is Virginia Woolf, famous and eccentric writer, plagued by her past and a mind she can't control.  While under the watchful care of her husband, who removes her from London in the 1920's in the hope of saving her from her \\"disease\\", she begins working on her piece, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Then there is the present day Clarissa Vaughan, who creeps into the visions created by Virginia's mental weakness and helps shape the famous literary character, Clarissa Dalloway.  Clarissa Vaughan has even been nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her ex-lover and friend, Richard, due to her likeness of the character, which leaves one wondering, \\"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\\"  Caught up in the middle of this weaving tale is Laura Brown, a 1950's housewife battling her own conflicts and reading Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Her gentle existence, though seemingly not outstanding at first, becomes the force that pulls the tendrils of Cunningham's philosophies into order and existence.  All three characters face similar battles; mental and physical illnesses (either of themselves or loved ones), the social barriers and private emotions of homosexuality, the confines of domestic responsibilities and expectations, the preoccupation of death.<br />Cunningham constructs this story so smoothly that it's hard to put down.  When I first heard of his book I assumed it would be somewhat awkward to read; shifting back and forth between decades and characters while trying to somehow find their commonality, but his craft is flawless and the story flows beautifully.  His style is comforting because it blends together new and abstract ideas with familiar detail and images of everyday objects.  <br />I truly believe that any fiction reader will be amazed by this book.  The talent of twisting a relatively preordained pattern of reading into something this fresh and intriguing is so hard to find.  I think a lot of readers will find some of their most private struggles and unnamed thoughts in these women.  This story challenges what you will admit about yourself and brings you a little bit closer to a truth that you're not quite sure is out there.	2003-01-26

When I first picked up this book I thought that Becky Bloomwood represented all of us in the \\"recreational shopper\\" category.  She loves clothing and makeup, cappuccinos and clearance sales.  A few pages into this hilarious and pitiful story, however, I realized exactly what Kinsella meant when she labeled her young, quirky lead a \\"shopaholic\\".  Ok, think \\"alcoholic\\", but replace the alcohol with leather boots, designer scarves and cashmere sweaters.   Becky's spending habitb are the culmination of a society that demands financial responsibility while showering its consumers with an overwhelming array of sale ad's, credit card offers and product displays.  So even while she's in debt up to her ears, avoiding over-due account notices and inventing excuses (such as her dog dying or her leg breaking) for late bank payments, she still can't get though one day without whipping out her Visa card and digging herself in deeper.   Sound sad?  Well, it gets better.  Becky is a financial journalist for a popular money magazine, writing articles to help people manage their personal funds.  No irony is lost in this story.<br />There's something so validating about a character that spews out in black-and-white what half of us think but can't admit.  \\"I honestly feel as though this piece of paper has nothing to do with me.  Perhaps, if I carelessly let [this bill] drop down on the floor behind my computer, it will disappear.  The cleaners will sweep it up and I can claim I never got it.  They can't charge me for a bill I never received, can they?\\"  Anyone who has ever anguished over their bulging credit account or fantasized about a computer glitch wiping the slate clean will feel a kinship with Becky, and anyone who hasn't will be humored by a glance inside this turmoil.<br />To fix her sticky situation Becky goes through a series of self-improvement adventures, each designed to either \\"make more money\\" or \\"cut back\\" her spending.  Of course she's doomed to repeat history no matter what idea she tries, and we, the readers, enjoy a good chuckle at her attempts.  <br />Every good story ends with a distinct feeling of closure, and Kinsella doesn't disappoint.  I'll admit I was afraid that Becky would find the easy way out (by winning the lottery or falling into a high-paying job), but the irony continues when a financial blunder she makes in the fourth chapter of the book turns out to be the story that brings her fame, financial freedom and a little romance.  <br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  The supporting characters are believable and detailed.  Kinsella gives no physical description of Becky at all, so I was able to plug in any features I wanted without feeling like I was messing up the character she intended.  I'm sticking with four stars for two reasons:  (1) It's pretty predictable for the most part.  There were a couple surprises for humor's sake that left me giggling, but as a whole we knew where this story was going.  (2) If you've read Bridget Jones's Diary then this story line will be strangely familiar.	2003-01-21

The little boy in this book is looking through his telescope in the park and is sure he keeps seeing a shark.  The lense is an actual hole in the pages of the book, and as each page is turned the fin of the shark turns out to be something quite ordinary (ie. a cat, a crow, even the dad's Elvis-style haircut).  This brightly illustrated book contains clever rhymes and pleasent repetition so kids can begin to chant along with the reader, and a surprise at the end leaves them giggling every time.	2002-12-24

I liked the story, however it lacked the snap that usually grabs my attention.  If you're looking for a story that dives into the complexities of real, everyday relationships pick up Joe Jones (a five star book by any means).  <br />If you're a fan, don't pass this book up because it's getting a three star average.  It's a really nice story and contains enough Anne humor to make you snicker in public.	2002-12-21

But the fact that I'm an adult can't keep me from reading these books.  I've never seen an Amelia book that I wouldn't give five stars.<br />I recently bought this book as a Christmas present for a girl.  I also purchased a blank b/w composition notebook and a packet of pens to put with it.  Moss's illustrations are hilarious and thoughtful as usual.  One set of pages I especially liked was a list of sounds that Amelia tries to explain to the deaf friend she has made (ie. a cat purring is like a sweater right out of the dryer).  Very cute.	2002-12-12

It starts out really slow as Graham sets up the characters, but it all unfolds very beautifully.  <br />This story is about five Airforce wives... Peggy, Betty, Lois, Audrey and Gayle and follows their lives through divorce, death, children and numerous moves.  It is told in the voice of Peggy, who is the glue that holds the clan together.  <br />This book is light, funny and very easy to believe.  I give it four stars because it wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, but it was obviously worth the time to read it.  Very entertaining.	2002-11-29
