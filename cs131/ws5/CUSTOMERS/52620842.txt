It gets pretty suspenseful in the end.  I would only recommend it if you like real classics.

I think this book is a good book to read because it gives a lot of information about the Navajo way of life.  I also liked it because it makes you want to  know what is going to happen to Kee and his family.  They are  captured by the U.S. government and made to walk out of their sacred land  to a fort controlled by the government.  They have to do many things  differently.  They have to build new homes and grow crops from a place that  does not supply the right materials for them.  Kee learns many things on  the walk and at the fort.

My favorite character was Mary Rose because she was really brave.  Some of the situations were silly, like leaving your kids in a car  alone at night, not noticing two girls in a library, and blue strobe lights  coming from the library after it was closed.

When a character was introduced, the author gave a good description of that person, and that's what caught my eye the most in the book.  It also  illustrated how cruel it is to make fun of people and how hurtful it is to  be on the receiving end of it.  Plus it was a good size book and it gave  just what you need to know.  Other books seem to go on and on and on and on  making them hard to follow.  The reader can barely tell what the plot is  because there are too many things going on.  My favorite part was when  Harriet was spying on her nanny by the lake.  I liked the fact that Harriet  thought of herself as a spy because that's something that I'd like to do,  too.  If I had written the book I might have had her using more gadgets  than the author does.  Harriet spends most of her time spying on people and  writing in her journal.  I would like to have seen more &quot;James  Bond&quot; type of action and suspense.  I really liked the book!	1999-04-07

Jerry loves baseball.  In the beginning he is playing baseball and gets hurt.  He got a base hit and he thought he could make it to second base.  When he did, the big second  baseman fell on his leg and Jerry was hurt.  Jerry went to the hospital,  and the doctor said he would need therapy.  The swimming coach said he  could do exercises at the pool for his leg.  The first day he went to the  pool he met some classmates that he knew.  After some days the coach asked  Jerry if he wanted to practice with the team for his leg to get better.   The coach told him he had a natural stroke.     In the end he decides to  try out for the team.  He was inspired by his friend.  At the first meet he  swam for a kid that was sick.  In another meet he asked to swim the 500  yard freestyle, and then later he swam the 50 yard freestyle race.  The  person that was supposed to do the relay race had sprained his ankle so the  coach asked Jerry to swim for him.  After that event the kids said he had  the winning stroke.        I liked this book because even though he wanted  to play baseball, he never gave up in swimming and he tried as hard as he  could.  By Kevin	1999-04-07

He makes lots of  friends at his first school, but his school is swallowed up by a sink hole.   His parents move him to a harder school where he becomes friends with all  of the &quot;tough kids&quot;.  All of the tough kids are on his soccer  team, he realizes that they are some of his best friends.  Another strange  thing that happens is:  lightning strikes the same field everyday at the  same time and place.  A boy on Erik's football team was killed because he  was standing in the place where the lightning struck when it struck.  At  the end of the book, Paul tells his parents that he really isn't blind.   They are surprised but happy.  Paul reveals all of his secrets of what he  knows Erik has done.  Erik was a thief and a murderer.  He killed a brother  of a girl and boy on Paul's soccer team!  I really liked the book because  it was funny, sad, and interesting.
