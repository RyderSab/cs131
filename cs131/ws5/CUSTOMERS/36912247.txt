You will be frustrated. If you want to sink into another time and explore another facet of human existance and let the author take you along at his pace, then by all means pick up the book and enjoy the ride. This is not a book to be quickly read, but one to be savored and thought about - there are lessons here. The author is imparting something meaningful. Will you be able to pick it up?<br /><br />The list of characters is longer than most books, yes. And it is quite surprising how enmeshed human lives become, just as a web. Luckily, the author has provided a well laid out list of characters in the back of the book to assist his readers in keeping track of who is who, although I never needed it. The author has a unique ability to introduce many characters yet keep each one individual, fleshing out a personality for each one until I could envision them as separate from each other.<br /><br />I will admit this was not an easy book to start, but it was impossible to put down once it had me swept up. Non-linear stories are often difficult to follow, I agree. But once a reader can get in tune with the author, this story will have you thinking.	2005-08-01

This book was a huge disappoint. It starts off pretty much like Grisham's more exciting books, and quickly devolves into a badly written Italian travelogue. If you want to learn all about Bologna, get this book!! If you want to learn Italian, get this book!!! If you want a \\"edge of the seat\\" thriller, go somewhere else and save your money.	2005-06-20

With his life somewhat out of control, he moves in with his daughter on her farm in a rural - and tumultuous - part of South Africa. There they are brutally attacked and each must come to terms with what has happened to them. This book is strangely disturbing and thought-provoking. The characters are not given much depth. In fact, it is difficult to say whether they are truly known or not. The ends without an ending as well. However, it is a story that stays with a reader. It is also an interesting study into life as a white person in South Africa and how the balance and blatant racism - on both sides - is prevelant. Not a book for those interested in pure entertainment, but for deeper reading, I would recommend.	2005-06-04

While the writing style was the same, and I truly enjoyed the descriptions and narrations of Elizabeth I and Queen Mary, I found the heroine, Hannah (Verde) Green, to be a bit of a stretch. Unlike Mary Boleyn in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" Gregory seems to have sold out to the romance novel ideal in attempting to set a 21st Century girl in 16th century England. It doesn't work in tawdry romance novels and it doesn't work here. The novel is a quick read and does hold interest, but I really wish that Gregory had made her heroine more true to her time. It would have continued the magic of her other novel. A good escapist read, and some interesting perceptions of two of England's most interesting monarchs, but not as engrossing as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\"	2005-05-16

Unless one is into the typical formulaic romance story, save your money and your time. When I did read romance novels - and there were quite a few - this one would not measure up in any way. <br /> <br />The thing that bothered me the most was the lead character Juliette Clemente. She is irritating, selfish, demanding, and, worse than anything, a know-it-all. I could have cared less about her and was dismayed to discover her personality never changes and she is most of the book. For me, there is nothing that destroys an historical fiction more than placing 21st century characters in past centuries. Does Ms. Johannson truly expect her readers to be entertained by doing this? I think it is so tiring when \\"writers\\" (and I use the term loosely here) try to infuse the typical \\"rebellious, independent, modern female, but with a heart\\" into past history, when she would obviously be more at home in mid-town Manhattan. <br /> <br />If you are looking for mindless drivel to while away time, go ahead and check this book out from the library. If you are looking for a well written story - romance, historical, or both - you will need to keep searching.	2005-05-16

It is not a work of fiction. It is not a traditional non-fiction book in that it cites a bunch of facts and figures from well-known sources. It is grusome in some regard. It will make you think. It may even make you cry. <br /> <br />Now...I have seen just one bullfight in my life, and for some strange reason I had enjoyed it. I didn't understand it, but I got caught up in what was going on. I read this book because I am going to Spain and was thinking of possibly going to a bullfight and wanted to know more about it. This book has really done a lot for me - including to help change my mind! <br /> <br />This is not a typical Hemingway book! The reader gets the feeling that Hemingway is sharing a table at a Spanish taverna, sipping wine and eating tapas, while sharing his thoughts and views on bullfighting. There are no sources. Hemingway is his own source. He outlines and describes the tragedy (as he calls it, for bullfighting is not a \\"sport\\" as Anglo-Saxon people understand the word) to those who have no understanding. At times, he does ramble. Just as some one who is truly sitting next to you talking to you would likely get off topic at times. It makes it more real. Much of the material is dated, but the book was written in 1931! <br /> <br />However, the basic principles of bullfighting remain the same. It is a tragedy that has continued since Roman times, and with just a few changes over the centuries. Hemingway does a terrific job in helping readers from countries who do not have this tradition try to understand this play of life and death. <br /> <br />If one is looking for a book to entertain and escape, this is not it! If one is looking to understand what bullfighting is, from some one who admired the play of tragedy, then this could be a very helpful read. But do expect this book to change you. For me, I once supported bullfighting wholeheartedly. After reading this, I find it disgraceful. Yourmileage will vary. This book packs influence!	2005-04-18

Granted, I have not read everything Hemingway has written, but I find it difficult to believe he could have written anything to surpass this novel. I am thankful that I read \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" before reading this book, as it would have set the standard too high. <br /> <br />In the previous books by Hemingway that I've read, he didn't seem to develop the characters fully and many of the scenes were only the sparcest of details. It seemed much had to be filled in by the reader. But 15 years after writing \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" Hemingway breaks through with \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls!\\" In this book, Hemingway gives depth to his characters - the reader comes to know, understand, and identify with each character in this book. Hemingway also provides a wonderful description of the area. One can almost envision the mountains and villages and the bridge, which plays a central role. During the scenes involving fighting, the reader can almost hear the gun shots and watch the anguish of those injured or killed. Even in the quiet times of the book, the reader can easily place themselves at the same table as the characters and truly feel they are a part of the story.  <br /> <br />The ending is easily figured out, but that doesn't seem to matter. Even though the reader might suspect or even know what is to happen, the events leading up to it keep the reader enthralled. <br /> <br />This book is a real page-turner, and Hemingway at his best. This is not just a \\"guy's book\\" - not at all! This is a story for both genders. Treat yourself to a literary masterpiece! You will not be disappointed!	2005-04-18

Pottinger brings the reader in with a series of vignettes that keeps the reader guessing as to how these people will fit together. The beginning action is fast-paced and a real page turner. <br /> <br />The middle of the book begins to get bogged down in its own technology. I don't think Pottinger really understood exactly what theory he was trying to explain. Because it can't be explain fully, the reader has to make logic where none exists. <br /> <br />At the end, I really didn't care how it ended. In fact, I thought it ended several times before it did - and it could have. I was very disappointed with the ending. I can understand that Pottinger tried to not make a neat and tidy ending, but in reality he gives the ending away long before it happens.  <br /> <br />I would actually rate this book 2 1/2 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow for that. This has more of a feeling of a \\"guy book\\" to me. That isn't bad, just not what most women would feel comfortable reading. Pottinger spends most of his time developing the male characters fairly well. He needs to devote as much time developing his female characters if he wishes to capture a female audience. <br /> <br />Can't say I would personally recommend this book, however it wasn't all that bad. The violence does get very graphic and over the top, but then again, I think that might be a \\"guy thing\\" so I'm not condemning the book for that. I think Pottinger wrote this book for a male audience, not female. (Yeah, I know...I'm throwing the gender card in along with the race card, aren't I? Well, it's how I see it!)	2005-03-17

As this story is 400 years old, I expect this book to be dry and dull and written in difficult to understand language. I could not have been more wrong in my life! This story is totally engrossing and, more than once, will cause the reader to laugh out loud.<br /><br />This is known as the world's first novel, and while reading it it was difficult to keep in mind that Cervantes did not have a blueprint to follow. Everytime I opened this book to read more, I felt like Cervantes was sitting there, spinning this tale for me. I've never been a fan of stories of knights and adventure stories, but this book kept me fully interested. I couldn't wait to finish it!<br /><br />What is truly wonderful is this is a story for all ages: young, old, and everyone in between. The size of the book may intimidate some at 1,000 pages, but don't let that happen. When a reader becomes involved with Don Quioxte and Sancho Panza and all the characters they encounter, the reader simply doesn't want the story to come to an end.<br /><br />In all fairness, this book was written in 2 parts. Once writing the 1st part, and seeing its popularity, Cervantes wrote part 2 just before he died. I have to admit that the 1st part is more compelling that the 2nd part, but not by a whole lot. There are adventures brought up in part 2 that one can only guess at in part 1. If one can only read some of this novel, then read part 1. But really, do yourself a favor and read the whole book. I doubt anyone would be disappointed.<br /><br />I seldom re-read books, but this is one I plan on re-reading in the future. Thoroughly enjoyable!	2005-02-08

The book did what I bought it for - kept my mind occupied for those times during the cruise when I wasn't doing anything.  <br /> <br />The story was predictable at best and the characters undeveloped. I didn't really care what happened to Santiago, the lead character. The story was trying too hard to be some big inspirational block-buster, but it just falls short of the mark.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a quick read to occupy your mind, this book might fill the bill. If you are looking for a well-written piece of literature, then look elsewhere.	2005-02-08

In fact, they may find it silly, sugary, and simplistic. The characters are not young, healthy, and vibrant, so I would suggest the younger crowd stay with those books who practice slick marketing. <br /> <br />However, if you have ever witnessed a person fade from disease and ultimately die. Or if you know of some one who is going through this now, then you might find comfort in this book. My father passed away from cancer 13 years ago, and I visited with him several times a week. Much of what I thought and felt could be reflected in the pages of this book. To witness a loved one die with dignity teaches you how to accept death in your own life. Albom has shown his readers this, and with great sensitivity. <br /> <br />Some here have said this book is filled with platitudes and simplistic philisophical phrases. Well...perhaps. Yet when people are facing death their thoughts often turn towards these things, and there can be a wealth of knowledge in their words - if we only take the time to absorb and listen. <br /> <br />To those who have not yet experienced the death of a loved one in their lives, I am happy for them. It is a pain I would not wish on anyone. However, if you have experienced the loss, and pain associated with that loss, of a loved one then you may have some nice quiet time with Morrie and his \\"simple platitudes\\" that just might help you look at life a bit differently.  <br /> <br />Oh, and don't forget the tissues.	2004-12-15

I bought this book because I so enjoyed \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\", and I am not disappointed one bit. Mitch Albom has a unique style of writing that will either appeal to one or not. I feel because he is a journalist first, his writing style reflects that in that he writes short, quick, and to the point. He doesn't go into \\"over detail\\" - something I detest in books. <br /> <br />The main character of Eddie is a man I think a lot of people will be able to relate to. He is everyman. Neither outstanding nor evil. Just.....ordinary, but likable. At the beginning of the book we know very little about Eddie, other than what he looks like and what he is experiencing that particular day. <br /> <br />However, through the 5 people he meets in heaven, we learn just who Eddie was. And we are glad we had the opportunity to meet him. Along the way Eddie even finds out a lot of himself, and his discovery of himself through others is interesting. <br /> <br />This is not the tissue dampening book that \\"Morrie\\" was. In fact, I closed the book happy that I had met Eddie and cheering for him in the end. This was a man that, even though I never met him, I would have liked to. <br /> <br />For those who have strict, unforgiving boundaries of what heaven and spirituality mean, they will find this a difficult book to get through. It does not follow the normal, orthodox Christian view of what is supposed to happen to one in the afterlife. But if one is open to differing viewpoints and interesting concepts, if one likes to cheer on the \\"good guy\\", if one likes to think that good ultimately prevails then this book just might be what you're looking for. Curl up in front of a fireplace with a good cup of something warm and this book, and prepare to meet Eddie - a man not easily forgotten!	2004-12-15

While it does not go into great depth, it does provide the reader with an overall basis of beginnings of the Spanish peoples, the civilizations that invaded the Iberian pennisula (Visigoths, Romans, Moors), and describes each of the monarchs.  <br /> <br />In addition, the author does provide an insight into the greater known artists of Spain and some of their more well-known works. He also explains the literary talent that Spain has contributed to the world. <br /> <br />The is a good, if not in depth, summary of the events leading up to the Spanish Civil War and what it meant politically to the country. The author covers a good deal of the Franco era, possibly because he was in the country during that time. Still, it provides the reader with a conceputalization of the period. I was a little disappointed that the author did not bring out the less valued parts of Franco's Spain. By reading this book one would think Franco was very nearly a saint. Still, I was thankful for the knowledge of international affairs during the Franco era, and America's reaction (or should I say non-reaction) to it. <br /> <br />The last chapter, \\"Spain Today\\", I feel is totally irrelevant. I would recommend not bothering to read it. This book was first written in 1963, and the last update to it was 1984/85. As the author describes \\"Spain Today\\" it is 20 years ago. A lot can, and does, happen in 20 years and I feel this chapter should either be updated or completely left out of the book. If one is reading this to educate themselves on current mores and values in Spain, this is not the chapter to gain that information. Because of the dated material in the final two chapters, which I feel are a waste of a reader's time, I felt I had to give this book 3 stars.  <br /> <br />If one is looking for a book to provide a brief, easy to read history of Spain, including artistsand authors, then this might be a worthy read. If one is looking for the modern day Spain, then this book is not of much use.	2004-12-14

At first I was caught up with the discovery of the body of a young woman murdered and the beginnings of a murder investigation. Beyond that everything went off-kilter. <br /> <br />The characters are not developed fully and I could not identify with any of them. I felt as though a string of eccentrics were passing by a window and I was simply watching the movements. I truly didn't care about any of these people or if Dora's murder was ever solved.  <br /> <br />The author leaves entirely too many ends unraveled. She brings up interesting tidbits, enticing the reader to believe these are important clues, only to leave them without any resolution. I can respect an author attempting to put the reader off onto another trail, but some of these clues are so obscure as to leave the reader questioning why it was even brought up in the first place. <br /> <br />As far as a \\"who done it\\", it is far too simple to solve. I had the \\"mystery\\" uncovered roughly mid-way through the book, but because I am usually so dense with these things, I kept reading hoping it would turn out to be some one else. When it was the person I believed it to be, I was totally dissatisfied. The joy of reading a murder mystery is to have some one revealed who a reader never expected. <br /> <br />I have to admit that the auther did a great job of describing Vienna at the turn of last century and that did hold my interest. Also, the excerpts from an old police crime \\"how to\\" book was somewhat interesting. It is for these two things that I'm giving this 2 stars. Outside of that, maybe 1 star.  <br /> <br />Save your money and pass this one by.	2004-12-07

The story concept is truly different and compelling. A young girl is raped and murdered, but she is caught between heaven and earth with the ability to see what effect her death has upon everyone who knew her.  <br /> <br />The book is a tad bit long (at times I found myself wanting the author to simply \\"get to the point\\"!), and the language could be a bit more down to earth. However, all in all, this book is a nice diversion and truly gives the reader something to think about about regarding life, death, and the hereafter.	2004-12-07

In speaking to a friend of mine, she suggested I read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and then read &quot;The Hours.&quot; Her suggestion was I would get the best understanding from both this book and the movie. She was absolutely correct!<br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt as though Michael Cunningham had a deep admiration for Virginia Woolf and her work. Yes, almost all of the characters in &quot;The Hours&quot; are lifted from the pages of &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; However, Mr. Cunningham makes these characters interesting and alive and people I would like to know. He writes in an organized fashion, as compared to Mrs. Woolf's stream of consciousness gibberish. The characters seem to have more depth, curiously, than the ones they are based on. They are easier to understand and sympathize with.<br />I would highly recommend this book, but I would equally recommend reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; first. My own perception of &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; was that it was duller than dull, but it does provide the basis for the characters the Mr. Cunningham brings to life and makes their stories easier to understand. I suppose one could read this book without reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; but I would find that difficult, personally.<br />The one facet that Mr. Cunningham brings up that I either missed or was too bored with &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; to pick up is the passage of the hours and their impact on the people in this book. It was obvious to me that Mr. Cunningham not only appreciated &quot;Mrs. Dallowy&quot; but he seemed to have an understanding of what VW was attempting to tell her readers and failed at. Here, he has succeeded.<br />If you are a Virginia Woolf fan or purist, you will probably not appreciate Mr. Cunningham's attempt at incorporating her characters into this story. However, if you like stories that have characters thatare alive and are people you can relate to, this story will like hold your interest.	2003-12-23

I fall into the second category.<br />I bought and read this book as a precursor to &quot;The Hours.&quot; While I would highly recommend reading this book before &quot;The Hours&quot; I will also admit that I found it difficult to get through and dull as old rain water.<br />I think what bothered me the most was the stream of consciousness writing. It's hard to really follow where VW was taking this story, and well, exactly WHY. Also, there are no chapters, and I personally find that a more difficult read. On top of these things, VW switches from one character's perception to another, leaving the reader wondering just who is doing what and necessitating a re-read to figure out just what happened to the character one was reading about and who this new character is.<br />The weird thing to me was, it seemed as though one could almost feel/read the disorganization and distortion that was perhaps VW's mental illness.<br />I know there are many books which have been deemed &quot;classic&quot; by some literary force but which people in modern day can't figure out exactly why. This is one of those books. It's reputation does not live up to its actuality. If you plan on reading &quot;The Hours&quot; this book should precede it. Otherwise, find something more engaging.	2003-12-22

I liked the slow, gradual unfolding of Dina's character and history, but it shows that what the book is truly about could have been written in half the amount of pages. Dina's &quot;punishment&quot; seemed unrealistic and contrived to me. <br />Ms. Ragen does have a way about her in telling a story, but her plots are overly predictable. This truly became apparent after I had read two of her books. Maybe she has expanded her storylines, but I doubt I shall seek her out in the future.<br />However, in all fairness to the author and fellow readers, I am not particularly a fan of romance novels and both of the books I read by Ms. Ragen were loaned to me. If one likes to read romance, I am certain they will find this book interesting, engaging, and fulfilling.	2003-10-30

From the very beginning, the reader is swept up into another time and place. I've read historical fiction before, and one thing I've always appreciated is when an author relates even small details of what life was like in the period they are writing about. Ms. Gregory does just that with this book. A reader can almost visulize what court life was like during the reign of Henry VIII - as well as smell the food at the feasts and feel the cloth used to make gowns. <br />This book is longer than most at 600+ pages, but I still finished it in a week. It moves along very quickly for the most part. There are a couple of times in the book that scenes seem repeated, but it truly comes together at a later time. Also, there are a few historical inaccuracies, granted. But that is to be expected in historical fiction - operative word here being fiction. If this book were to be a biography, it would fall far short. But it is a work of fiction, and as such, the author does a fine job.<br />I would give this book 5 stars, however, I felt the ending was a bit weak and contrived. But then again, anyone who knows about Anne Boleyn knows how it is to end, right? Yet, I felt Ms. Gregory could have worked in something a little more entertaining. However, this book is nicely written, moves along at a good pace, and draws the reader into its presence. With all of that, it is certainly worth the effort.	2003-10-30

The book does give a glimpse into a world seldom ever shared with outsiders, and I found this intriguing. The book certainly \\"grabs\\" its readers from the beginning. However, the flashback scenes to the main characters childhoods, even though providing necessary information, was almost a distraction. As well, the flashback takes up a good 1/3 of the book and I felt it might have been better stated at the beginning of the book. <br />When the book is half finished, it becomes rather predictible. The main character is raped by a black man, has sex with her husband the same night, and give birth to a white child. That would seemingly end the story, yet it continues. This leads the reader to pretty much figure what happens next.<br />Even with that, I enjoyed the book as a pleasant diversion. (And enough to go ahead and begin \\"Sotah\\" as well) 3 stars is lower than I would give this book, but it doesn't quite reach 4 stars, in my opinion. I would truly give it 3 1/2 stars, if that were possible.<br />I thought the more interesting points in the book were below the surface and how three differing points of view, from three very different women, were demonstrated: from the rebellious Hadassah, to the accepting Tamar, to the reflective Jenny. All three women are strong characters in their own right, and all follow different paths. The relationships between the three and within their own worlds is a fascinating character study.	2003-10-20

I truly expected to dislike this book, and and was more than pleasantly surprised when I found myself drawn into the story from the first Chapter!<br />If you are looking for fluff and fairytale endings, this book isn't for you. It is a story that is dark and descends into a world that very few ever truly get to experience. There is not much joy in this book, granted. But it is the reality of many children in the foster care system - and I work in that system and have seen things very similar to what this book brings to light.<br />Previous reviewers have stated they felt the book had a soap operah feel to it. That might be true to those who have not talked or listened to kids who have spent a good deal of their life in foster care. Granted, it is difficult to believe that all that happens to Astrid (the main teen-aged character) could possibly occur to one person, but the reality is that many kids do go through these things.<br />The beauty of this book is that we are told the story of Astrid through Astrid's eyes. Therefore, we are not given the hard line, third person, totally objective point of view. We are given her point of view, and how she changes and adapts to the situations she is presented with. Her vision is not objective - whose is? She tells her story, as she sees it, as she feels it. Reading of how Astrid's view of her mother changes over the course of the years she is in foster care helps to show the reader that kids see their parents very differently than adults do.<br />Astrid's mother does come across as some one totally unlovable - but that is also towards the end of the book. When Astrid is a young girl she sees her mother as some one who is a free spirit, marches to a different drummer, and a bit odd. Yet, she loves her mother. This paradox propels the entire story, until Astrid learnsto deal with this internal struggle.<br />If you are looking for a book to breeze through on a lazy afternoon, pass this one by. If you are looking for a book that will show you the reality of a child's nightmare, and a book that causes you to think long after the last page is finished, then I highly suggest giving this book a chance.	2003-09-17

I am a total fan of his work! This particular story is moving and touching, and the characters have the potential to continue to haunt one's imagination.<br />Hemingway wrote in a style that is hard to get used to. He didn't write in a way that involved a lot of over-descriptive phrases or indepth character studies. It seems he left his readers to use their imaginations and not be told every single detail of a story. For some people this works and for others it doesn't. But if it works for you, then this story will envelope you and take you to a distant time and place. Even though we are not told very much about Fred Henry and Catherine Barkley, the two seem to become very intimate and familiar. Perhaps from developing them in one's own mind.<br />Perhaps the storyline could be considered somewhat tired. What wartime romance isn't? However, Hemingway wrote this book in the 50s, and it is easy to get the feel that he was writing about himself. (Hemingway was an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI) That touch of possibly revealing himself to the reader makes this book even more touching.<br />I would not recommend this book if it is the first Hemingway some one is to read. Start with one of his shorter works or his short stories to get used to his style of writing. Work your way up to this book and you most likely won't be disappointed!	2003-08-27

It moves along at a good pace. The descriptions of Prague in the 1600s is captivating.<br />The only character who seemed to have any depth was the emporer, who I don't think the author wanted to be the main character. The Jewess, Rochel, is simply not a very developed character, making it difficult for the reader to identify with her or care very much about what happens to her. While her plight was interesting at a certain level for me, I didn't really &quot;get into her skin&quot;.<br />There is more comedy in this book than I had imagined, and that was appreciated. I don't think the author took this book extremely seriously, and the brevity helped me get through the book.<br />I also was bothered somwhat by the lack of historical accuracy. More modern terms, such as &quot;hold your horses&quot;, and other slang phrases seemed out of place and more distracting to the story. Truly, the author should have left them out completely.<br />This book is not deep, nor is it overwhelming. It is a nice companion to take along to the beach or those long train/plane rides. Enjoyable.	2003-08-13

It's about an American dream, how 4 unlikely misfits came together to achieve that dream, and how an unlikely hero captured the heart of American racegoers in the 30s.<br />I have loved horse racing from the first time my father took me to Santa Anita almost 20 years ago. I've seen the statues of Seabiscut and George Woolf at that racetrack many times, but never knew their story. I am thankful to Ms Hillenbrand for writing a story so compelling and so well-researched that I came to know all of these characters so well.<br />As a side note, I liked the way Ms Hillenbrand takes the time to explain to the reader about horse racing, its terms, and what it means to the owners, the trainers, and the jockeys. She makes it a world that is simple to understanding, while at the same time never losing the true heart of this book.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and yeah, it'll even make you cheer!	2003-08-13

I do not anticipate reading anything else that he publishes. The plot has been stated numerous times, and is really not worth repeating here. The first 30 pages of this book are interesting and somewhat engaging. After that, it is simply a chore to read. It is the sort of book that one keeps reading because they expect something will happen. Alas, nothing does, and when the book is closed the story is soon forgotten.<br />If one believes their life is totally useless, uneventful, and without meaning, then read this book as it is bound to ease your depression. Surely no one has ever had a life as truly boring and dismal as Lucy Gault's.<br />Quite frankly, I'm still perplexed as to exactly how this book was ever published.	2003-07-22

Although not the most boring book I've ever read, &quot;The Story or Lucy Gault&quot; rates up in the top 5. The plot and storyline has been gone over ad nauseum, so I will spare any who are reading this.<br />Quite frankly, by the end of the book I couldn't figure out exactly why it had been written. Well, unless Mr. Trevor's idea was to write about the most singularly boring life ever. This book firmly stretched the bounds of credibility as the years go past and Lucy never does anything with her life. The reader is lead to think she awaits forgiveness, yet when it comes she does not remember what it was for and cannot accept it. So, it leaves one asking, &quot;Just why did this book need to be written, and how did it ever get published?&quot; <br />I could not identify with any of the characters in this book, and especially felt nothing but contempt for Lucy's self-pity. It was suggested in the book that perhaps Lucy had meant to be killed at 8 years of age. I wish in fact that had been the case, as the majority of anything interesting takes place during the first 50 pages.<br />William Trevor is, I understand, a short story writer. That is perhaps what he should stick to. Novels require too much development and involvment for him, evidently.	2003-06-10

The writing was dull and the story simply plodded along. This book was a chore to read. The &quot;surprise&quot; ending is contrived and seemed as though the author simply could not figure out how the book should end and pulled a rabbit out of her hat. <br />A disappointing piece of writing and I simply cannot recommend this book to anyone.	2003-05-19
US	36912247	R3J4PN9WNOCRMG	080411868X	293874514	Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Cute, Sweet, Historically Inaccurate	First, I have to say that I genuinely liked most of the characters that Fannie Flagg developed in &quot;Welcome to the World, Baby Girl&quot;. Especially well liked were Norma and Macky and Aunt Elner. There was a sweet charm to these characters that made me smile and wish that I actually knew people like these.<br />The layout of the book was a little frustrating for me. Ms. Flagg jumps back and forth between time periods, which makes following the story more than a bit confusing. Also, because the shifts can be dramatic - going from 1974 to 1952 - means the reader must make some real mental shifts to follow along. I realize that Ms. Flagg is trying to build suspense, but this was overly much.<br />I'm not certain if it is because it took Ms. Flagg 12 years to write this book, or because of the back and forth nature of the way she tells the story, but historical inaccuracies abound and are very, very apparent. For me, they drew away from the story being told, and I am quite frankly amazed that no other reviewer has mentioned this. Ms. Flagg has the 911 emergency number fully operational as of 1968 (when in fact it was 1973), and an 87 year old woman giving birth. (A woman born in 1808 giving birth in 1895 - a little far-fetched) There are scores of other historical inaccuracies until the book simply becomes comical for a reader to find all of the errors. <br />If one is able to get beyond these inaccuracies and this book as pure &quot;fluff&quot;, it might be quite enjoyable. Otherwise, it might be interesting just to pick out the inaccuracies.	2002-12-30

I was soon very disappointed, and am not certain exactly how I waded through the 143 pages. \\"A Woman's Education\\" gave me no insight into the person who is Jill Kerr Conway. I do not know her any better than I did prior to reading this book. (I have not read her prior two books) Her concentration appeared to be focused on the male-dominated educational system, and the fact that she is a feminist and wanted Smith College to be known as a feminist insititution. One hundred and forty-three pages is a little overly long to drill this message into a reader's brain.<br />It would have been more interesting to know about Jill Kerr Conway. While she does describe her struggles with an aging faculty and touches on the backbiting politics of Smith College in the mid-1970's, she comes across as a person completely devoid of any human emotion. Even her husband's bi-polar condition and her mother's death are treated as mere facts and the reader is left wondering what, if anything, Jill Kerr Conway truly felt about these traumatic events occuring in her life at the same time as taking over the position of president at Smith College. I came away from this book knowing only that Jill Kerr Conway considers herself a feminist, that her major area of study was history, and nothing more. Surely, no one is that uninteresting?<br />The feel of this book reads as a textbook, and it seems Ms. Conway wrote it more from the position of a history professor than from a more human aspect. This is the type of book that a Women's Studies professor would deem required reading, and I truly felt that it is to those students who Ms. Conway was writing to.	2002-12-30
