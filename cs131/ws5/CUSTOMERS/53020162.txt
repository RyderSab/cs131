US	53020162	R1EN4ZELIG30MH	0964243512	852742850	Construction Spanish (en inglés y español) (Spanish Edition)	Books	4	25	25	N	Y	Handy little book	I bought this book because I wanted to round out my overall knowledge of Spanish. What I found was a very handy book. I mean this literally: it's a very tiny book that you can easily carry around in your back pocket.    Right up front, the author says \\"This is not written in textbook Spanish, but it is Spanish used on the job.\\" I would concur. Mr. Scott shows his jobsite experience in the last phrase in the book: \\"No soy de la migra\\" (\\"I am not from immigration\\"). The only real downside is that there are some questionable translations and some Spanglish - \\"aguantar\\" instead of \\"sostener\\", \\"ahorrar\\" instead of \\"guardar\\", \\"concreto\\" instead of what I believe is the (sometimes) more proper \\"hormigon\\", etc. (To his credit, he translates \\"hold this\\" as \\"agarre esto\\" instead of \\"coja esto\\", which may get you smirks.) But I am sure the people would understand what you mean.    There is also no information on the hardest part of Spanish: conjugating verbs. But as I tell people, you can probably get by in most any language with only pronouns, the infinitive, and forget the articles and gender. \\"Usted recoger herramientas, pongalo aqui\\" sounds pretty \\"Me Tarzan-You Jane\\"-ish (\\"Pick up the tools, put them here\\", literally \\"You to pick up tools, put it here\\") but it gets the idea across. As you can see, some verbs are conjugated in at least the imperative - although the book's a bit inconsistent between formal and informal.    As another reviewer mentioned, some words that would be useful are missing - such as concrete related terms (screed and footing, though trowels are included) - but that's to be expected: no book can include everything. With the number of Latino concrete workers, though, it may be useful to include some in the next revision.    All in all, it's a very good little book, and you can't beat either the portability or the price. Although you definitely can't use it to learn Spanish (try \\"Dicho y Hecho\\", along with \\"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish\\" if you'reserious), you can certainly use it to pick up important words you will need on the jobsite, and I highly recommend it for anybody who either needs a bit of Spanish on the job or would like to round out their general Spanish knowledge with some work-related terminology.	2005-09-21

I have read many, and overall I think it is the best. It is probably best for those of intermediate skill level (those they call \\"handy\\" in their 3-level self-rating scale) because my guess is that people with absolutely no construction or design knowledge probably won't find enough information to really understand what the structural issues are. For example, the joist/beam/post spacing tables are rather sparse: enough information to do the calculations if you know what you're doing, but probably difficult to figure out if you don't. <br /> <br />However, for many of us, it's just the thing. One of my favorite parts is all the Work Smart hints scattered throughout the book. These are tips from pro builders giving ideas and information that us non-pro wouldn't know. There are even tips in there about what to do if you make a mistake in building. <br /> <br />The pictures are great too, better than any other deck building book I've used. This is where the book really shines. They give you step-by-step instructions with full pictures of several different decks under construction. The concrete pouring sequence alone is worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />Despite all the tools they list that are mentioned in a previous review, it seems pretty honest to me: for example, they tell you, under mixing your own concrete: Pros don't mix their own concrete, they get trucks to deliver it. Pretty good, considering that Home Depot sells concrete mix and all the tools required to mix it yourself! <br /> <br />The only major thing I can think of that it doesn't cover is composite decking materials. These are all the rage nowadays, of course, but they require some changes in design. It would be nice to have information on these changes, and hopefully future editions will have this information. <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent book, and well worth its price. <br />	2005-08-10

This is a very good book on the varieties of Spanish spoken in the Americas. In addition to a general description of the factors involved in differentiating the Spanish of different countries, it goes through each country with Spanish as their official language and talks about the lexical, syntactic, and other aspects of the dialects. It also mentions special characteristic vocabulary of each country.<br /><br />It's marketed as a linguistics book, which it is, but I say that all serious students of Spanish should buy it because the Spanish you learn in the classroom is going to be representative of a small segment of the Spanish world in general at best. There is such a variety of Spanish spoken in Latin America and some of it, sadly, you get very little knowledge of. As long as you're only speaking in your classroom, it doesn't matter that much. But as soon as you step outside and try to start speaking with native speakers of one country or another, you become painfully aware that your general Spanish education has been missing a few things.<br /><br />For example, all Spanish students learn there are three main forms of the second-person pronouns: \\"t&uacute;\\", \\"usted\\", and \\"ustedes.\\" Many student also know that in Spain they use \\"vosotros,\\" but not in the Americas. Well, in my recent experiences I find out that sometimes (in formal speech, especially in Bible quotes) \\"vosotros\\" is used in the Americas (I went to Costa Rica), and that there is yet another second- person pronoun, \\"vos\\", that has its own rules; conversely, in some countries (Costa Rica, Argentina, and some others), \\"t&uacute;\\" is used very rarely, at least among native speakers. On the other hand, they will readily use \\"t&uacute;\\" with foreigners like me. This explains why central American speakers immediately use \\"t&uacute;\\" with me, yet they may use \\"usted\\" or \\"vos\\" among themselves.<br /><br />I give my \\"vos\\" example to point out where this book really shines. It explains in great detail the tendancies of people to either use or refrain from using \\"vos\\" and how it stacks up against \\"t&uacute;\\" and even \\"usted\\", country-by-country. It describes the class stigmas and norms associated with each form in each country. This is information that you just can't get in a Spanish class. Even if there was time, you may not get it: I asked a friend who is a Spanish teacher, and she doesn't even know about \\"vos\\". Her teachers may not have either.<br /><br />This book does not cover the Spanish of Spain to any great extent (obviously), nor does it spend much space on Spanish of the United States. The latter would be interesting and would further one's main purpose in reading this book. The only coverage I've found of US Spanish is related to Mexican Spanish, which shows a bit of a western US bias. Here in the east, we have more Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Cubans, and (in my area of Washington, D.C.) Salvadorans and Peruvians than Mexicans. To see how these various native language forms interact with English would be interesting and add to the value of the book. It also does not cover other countries whose language is not officially Spanish yet have large Spanish-speaking populations, such as Brazil and the Phillipines. On the other hand, the book would have to be frightfully long to cover all this.<br /><br />My other little problem with the book is that it's written a bit from what I would call an \\"anti-snob-snobbery\\" view: that the ideas of language standards are antiquated and that people should never strive to change the way they speak to fit what they term \\"prestige norms.\\" This is, I take it, the same idea behind Ebonics: the way people is speak is just fine, no matter how it is; and that any attempt to change your linguistic habits to conform to norms (of any type) is ill-advised and comes only under pressure from the man. I don't agree with this idea, at least not in full. I would agree that no form of language is (objectively, and based solely on linguistic criteria) \\"better\\" than any other. Thus, with the author, I don't believe it's true that the closer the spoken Spanish matches the written Spanish, the \\"better\\" it is from some grand, almost moral, point of view. Similarly, in another realm, English is no \\"better\\" than American Sign Language; for that matter, English is no \\"better\\" than Spanish (and, which is often forgotten, vice-versa).<br /><br />But it's not a matter of \\"better\\" in some moral sense: it's a matter of ease of communication, of being able to work together effectively toward a common goal, of feeling comfortable with other people, and making them feel comfortable with you. People naturally want greater ease and comfort of communication: I see nothing wrong with letting them get it. If they want to change their linguistic habits (our way of speaking is, after all, simply a habit: it might have been different), it's their affair, and I don't blame them at all. Or let's turn it around: why should I bother learning to imitate a particular accent in speaking Spanish? Why not just speak Spanish like the gringo that I am? \\"Yaou taingouw much-uh ham-bree.\\" (Gringo-ese for \\"Yo tengo mucha hambre.\\") Answer: because I want to fit in with people and make them at ease with me.<br /><br />Finally, I should mention that since it is a linguistics book, it assumes knowledge of things like the IPA alphabet, the difference between a fricative and a velar, etc. If you're not a linguistics student you'll probably have to do a little outside reading to catch up.<br /><br />However, I urge you to look past (possible) philosophical disagreements and linguistics impediments and buy this book. It'll do wonders for your Spanish and give you great insights into the minds of Latin Americans.ue that the closer the spoken Spanish matches the written Spanish, the \\"better\\" it is from some grand, almost moral, point of view.

US	53020162	R10H8038AVYC15	0743523571	991627717	Pimsleur Spanish Level 1 CD: Learn to Speak and Understand Latin American Spanish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Comprehensive) (English and Spanish Edition)	Books	4	122	133	N	N	Good memorization approach	I have been using a number of recorded Spanish lessons to learn Spanish on my own, including the Foreign Service Institute course (Mastering Spanish, levels 1 and 2) and lessons from learningspanishlikecrazy.com. One of the best things about the Pimsleur's Spanish series is that it has more interactivity than the other courses I've used. There are many set up situations where you interact back and forth with a recorded speaker. I have found this to be very helpful in practicing for real live speakers. Mastering Spanish, for example, has a lot more single-sentence utterances you copy, but less back-and-forth. (I understand the new Platiquemos tries to correct for this problem.) <br /> <br />Another good point about Pimsleur is that it uses a repetition pattern developed by Dr. Pimsleur that has worked well in helping me memorize the material. They present a word or phrase several times, go on to other things, then go back to that recently-learned phrase again. A bit later, they hit it again. I find this to be very effective in helping me remember the material. <br /> <br />The main drawback is that the tapes are somewhat slow, and overly formal. For example, phrases like \\"Encantado,\\" \\"Que le vaya bien,\\" and \\"Por supuesto\\" are taught instead of more informal equivalents (such as \\"Mucho gusto\\", \\"Nos vemos\\", and \\"Claro\\"). But whether this is good or bad may depend on what you want to get out of the language: if you're a tourist or in business, you may want to be more formal, so the more formal phrases may work well for you. For everyday communication, however, I've found less formal is better. Some people immediately tutear (use the informal 'tu') with you, and it would be nice to immediately switch into an informal mode of communication with them. <br /> <br />To overcome the formality trap, get a book like \\"Breaking out of Beginner's Spanish.\\" I cannot say enough good things for this book. It is an indispensible companion to any self-study course, and will get you using words and phrases appropriate to the situation. You might also want to sign up at learningspanishlikecrazy.com, where you have weekly teleconferences with a native speaker. <br /> <br />Finally, this series is clearly very expensive. But, never fear: try your local public libraries before buying one yourself, either as a \\"try before you buy\\", or instead of buying. (I always try to borrow materials first before I buy them, so I can evaluate them myself.) I've been through most of the course now, and have borrowed everything from a local library. <br /> <br />In summary, there are drawbacks to the course, but I find its memorization approach to work very well for me. <br />	2005-01-10

I'm skipping over his ignorant denunciations of radio and TV preachers (\\"There I hear preacher after preacher be so absolutely sure of his bombproof answers and his foolproof biblical interpretations ... his crisis of the month [toward which you should give a \\"love gift\\" if the Lord so leads]\\" and, for the moment, of \\"church people.\\" This is old stuff and you can read page after page of denigration of media preachers and \\"old-style church people\\" all over.    More interesting are his philosophical mistakes. For example, on page xvi: \\"You see, if we have a new world, we will need a new church.\\" (He's quoting an earlier book of his in explaining where the impetus for this book came from.) This idea seems to underlie his philosophy of the world and of \\"religion\\" and is detailed throughout the rest of the book. Depending on interpretation, I suppose his proposition may be logically valid.    But there are two problems with this statement. First, having to do with the truth of his antecedent: *what* new world is he talking about? How is the world any different than it has been for at least 4,000 years of recorded history? People are still the same as they ever were: there is goodness in most everybody, evil in everybody, and varying levels of faith and trust in God. There are people who believe in the God of the Bible; people who believe in another God or gods; people who believe in no god at all; people who don't have the courage to believe one way or another, but simply to remain on the fence; people who want to know what to believe but are looking for somebody to tell them. (I am sad for those who end up talking to people like the author of this book, who essentially tells them to make their god in any image that fancies them for the moment.) There are wars, poverty, pestilence, prejudice, and hate. Sounds like the same old world to me.    If there is no new world, as I think is plain, then there must be some other good reason for McLaren's rejecting what Christianity has always taught. Another reason given in the book are the \\"19th century\\" attitudes (also old stuff - read John Shelby-Spong and you'll get an earful of it, and better written though more biased and ignorant) of typical hide-bound \\"church-goers.\\" The author makes a major mistake in assuming that objections to his new religion come from his stereotypical \\"church goers.\\" This is clearly a mistake. To take my own example, I am no hide-bound \\"church goer\\" who just can't bear to part with my cherished traditions: I am a relatively recent convert to Christianity, having gone through a \\"church goer\\" phase while growing up, followed by an I'm-sure-there's-a-God-but-he's-not-a-part-of-my-life phase, an agnostic-and-I-don't-care-because-a-god-would-get-in-my-way phase, an atheist phase, a Buddhist phase, a liberal \\"Christian\\" phase, and now a real Christian phase (although in a completely different kind of church from where I was brought up). If I haven't seen it all, I've seen a lot of it: and I still don't like what I see here.    It's not surprising to see other reviewers of this book making the same mistakes as McLaren. Anybody who would say something like \\"Don't read ... if you're convinced that if Jesus were here today he'd be a right-wing, fundamentalist with lots of Jewelry and his own tv show\\" not only has no clue, but has let his liberal bias show in an appalling manner. I expect many of them will mark my review \\"non-helpful\\", but I guess that's the price I pay.    In summary, I commend anyone who wants to learn more about Christianity, and to some extent even those (...) who want to to modify its natural parts (music, liturgy) to better suit modern people. But modifying what Christianity is all about is something different. Creating a new religion is all well and good, but please don't call it \\"Christianity.\\" It confuses those who can least well distinguish between it and the real thing.	2005-01-04

This was the first in the Franklin-in-Spanish series of books that I read with my daughter. My daughter loves for me to read it to her, each sentence first in Spanish, then in English. <br /> <br />It (as well as the other books in this series) is great for two reasons. First, they teach the life lessons that Franklin books and videos typically teach. <br /> <br />But second, for any person learning Spanish, they're also great for learning common vocabulary and expressions. You want to learn the kind of vocabulary and expressions that everybody will know? Look at a book written for five-year-olds! <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it's a bit depressing knowing that my current knowledge level is somewhat below a Latino pre-schooler. But if you can put aside your pride, this series is great for helping to learn the language. <br />	2004-12-08

If I write a book on modern popular music, for example, I would not expect it to be disparaged if it insufficiently covers medieval architecture or Roman medical advances. <br /> <br />This analogy comes to mind when thinking about this book. At first, I was myself tempted to dismiss the book. On the negative side, each word has only one sentence, and there's no English-to-Spanish section. What good is that? <br /> <br />Other reviewers have taken this tack. A book with 1000 words isn't going to be useful if you know much more than 1000 words. And a book with no pronunciation guide is not going to be very useful for beginngers. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the clear purpose of this book is one that I feel it does quite well: it's for the intermediate student (like me) and shows you which words to concentrate on learning. In other words, it helps me build my working useful vocabulary. I have several dictionaries: the problem for me is to know which words out of the 80,000 to concentrate on learning and which to ignore. <br /> <br />In some cases, you can look at the English and take a guess: the word meaning \\"talk\\" is likely to be very useful and \\"disambiguate\\" less so. Again, though, it's that middle category I want to know about: the ones that are useful even though, not having made a serious study of word usage, they don't seem so to me. And that's where the book really shines. It's a handy list of those words. <br /> <br />Its small size is also a plus. I carry it around with me and look at it from time to time when I have a free second. <br /> <br />In summary, this is a good little book that will help the intermediate student build his working vocabulary. It's not perfect, but it's a decent little book to have around. <br />	2004-11-26

Among the chapter highlights are:    - Ten Ways to Avoid Being Taken for a Gringo: Excellent things to think about if you want to fit in and not insult people by your actions.    - Minding Your Verbal Manners: Things Spanish-speakers would take for granted that any considerate, well-groomed person would know.    - The Secret Life of Verbs: Almost everything you need to know about verbs in general. (I like the summary of the future tense: for the most part, forget about it. But he does give a good summary on the use of the \\"Future of Uncertainty\\" construction.)    - The Twilight Zone: All about that beautiful, nasty subjunctive mood. Those who have studied Latin or Greek will not find the subjunctive terribly scary, but for everybody else... well, that's probably another story. I find Keenan's categorizations of the subjunctive usages very, very helpful. He does it differently than any grammar I've ever seen; taken together with a grammar, you have two different ways of looking at the same thing, which greatly helps you remember. For example, one of his categories is the \\"Traveler's Subjunctive\\"; when in Costa Rica, it was because of this book that I asked \\"¿Hay autobuses que vayan a Birri?\\" instead of the incorrect \\"... van a Birri?\\".    - Sixty-four Verbs: Better descriptions on their range of meaning and usages that the one-liners usually provided in dictionaries don't cover. Coverage varies from short to comprehensive. Has many good parts but some of the treatments are a bit weak. This is a common place for unexpected things to be thrown in due to his train-of-thought writing style (see below).    - Cranking Up Your Spanish: All those sentence starters (\\"En fin,\\" \\"Es que,\\" \\"A ver,\\" etc.) that don't show up in grammars and can drive you crazy since they set the scene for the rest of the sentence.    - Snappy Answers: Quick responses to things that may catch you off-guard.    - Invective and Obscenity: Survey of forceful, rude, and obscene speech (with the obligatory warnings about things that may get you in a fight)    - Which is Which: Words that English speakers often confuse.    - Influences of Spanish on English and vice-versa    From my point of view, among the good points of the book are:    1. It helps with many problems the beginner is likely to have. Most language books are written by native speakers of the language. In this book, Keenan takes a different approach: he is going to explain all of the problems he had himself while learning the language and using it for many years among native Spanish-speakers. Since I expect I will have most of the same problems, having them laid out is very helpful.    2. It is extremely engaging. I have spent many nights up late reading it. Yes, you read that right. Don't think in terms of your typical grammar book: think in terms of an long article where a fellow Spanish learner says \\"Ok, here's everything I learned about the language.\\"    3. It has filled in my experience with my other Spanish courses. Often, idiomatic words or phrases will come up in them that don't make a lot of sense. Keenan explains virtually all of them, including which sound stilted or odd to Spanish-speakers.    4. It has excellent sections on the difference between ser and estar, between the imperfect and the preterite, and the subjunctive. These are some of the bugaboos that traditionally plague us Spanish students. The ser/estar treatment in particular is better than any book I've used: he goes far beyond the typical \\"estar is for things that change\\" explanation - which is true but incomplete. I finally understand, for example, why you say \\"está muerto\\" instead of \\"es muerto.\\"    5. It has good sections on how not to give offense to people from different cultures. In every culture, people do some things completely innocently that are interpreted in other cultures as aggressive or insulting. Although there is no single \\"Hispanic\\" culture, Keenan helps by pointing out some things that are commonly considered negative that I might not expect. I should note that Keenan's experience is primarily in Mexico, so most of the cultural and localized language usage tips are centered on Mexico.    I really, really, wanted to give this book 5 stars, but I can't. So what's not to like? Just two things, really:    1. It has no index. This makes it difficult to find words or phrases. I would expect this kind of book to have a fairly extensive index, but none is provided. As I use this book more and more, I find this to be a bigger and bigger problem. Often, I'll find I need to use some verb or construction and want to look it up. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to do because it could be in one of several chapters. Let's say I'm trying to remember something about a given verb: do I look in \\"Tricksters,\\" \\"The Secret Life of Verbs,\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Sixty-Four Verbs,\\" or \\"Spanish Roots?\\" Or, let's say you are trying to remember a word or expression that you seem to recall is sometimes misused, and you want to use it right. Do you look in \\"Tricksters,\\" \\"Invective and Obscenity,\\" \\"Which is Which?\\", \\"Say it Right,\\" or \\"The Big Mix?\\" I have spent more time than I like leafing through the various chapters looking for a word that could have been indexed.    This problem is made worse by Keenan's train-of-thought writing style. He introduces verbs and expressions in places where they don't at all fit, analytically speaking. Now, don't get me wrong - the writing style works, and very well. A more rigorously outlined writing style would not be nearly as easy and fun to read. But it makes it darn difficult to find what you're looking for. I have taken to writing cross-reference notes in my own copy.    2. Keenan uses obscenities more freely than I'd like (even outside the chapter specifically on obscenities). Now, I'm not a \\"schoolmarm\\" (Keenan's words); but I don't think this kind of language is really necessary. Not that the book is full of obscenities: it's not. But they pop up here and there (again, the train-of-thought style); it would have been fairly easy to substitute non-obscene language in most of these places, but he doesn't.    For these reasons, I could not give this book five stars. But, overall it is an excellent book, and one that will greatly enrich both your understanding and your fluency.    By the way, I've read other reviews and lists saying that this book is more for advanced students of Spanish. ¡No es verdad! While I'd agree that it's probably not for rank beginners, I believe one of the keys to really learning a language is to get out there and starting speaking to people as soon as you can. And this book gives you the tools to get out there, speak confidently and semi-fluently, and not give offence when you don't mean to.	2004-09-07

I think most men know that we're not living up to all that we could or should be, but so many of us don't know what to do about it. We're not being \\"real men.\\" So many of us didn't have good role models in our own fathers, and this book can help fill in the gaps. For example, I use this book when working with young men whose wives or (more often) girlfriends are pregnant at the Crisis Pregnancy Center where my wife and I volunteer.<br /><br />Now, for those of you who may be thinking \\"Oh no, not another 'get naked and beat tribal drums' book,\\" Weber discusses several of the \\"drum beating\\" types of books, fairly discussing their positive points but concluding that they fall way short of where they need to in their search for authentic manhood. To find what men are made to be, you have to go back to the Author himself: past one man's personal insights into himself, past ancient tribal customs, past the \\"old stories\\": to the original Author Himself. This is a very Biblically-based book, and Weber makes no apologies for that.<br /><br />Weber divides manhood into four divisions, which he calls King, Warrior, Mentor, and Friend. This general theme is discussed in some other books on manhood (as Weber admits) but not as Biblically as Weber does it. For example, another book calls them \\"blueprints\\" of a man: Weber says he prefers to think of them as \\"fingerprints\\" of the man's Creator.<br /><br />But Weber doesn't hang his entire book on these four (rather arbitrary) divisions. Weber then finds a common thread throughout all of them: Initiative. I think this idea of Initiative being the core of manhood was one of the most insightful single contributions Weber makes. To quote: \\"Just as a compass without a needle is not a compass, a man without Initiative is not a man.\\" Perfect.<br /><br />He also very clearly shows how Initiative is not equal to being Bossy. Taking Initiativemeans taking initiative in helping out around the house, in saying you're sorry, in asking your wife's help, in asking \\"what do my wife and kids need right now that I can help with?\\" It's about as far from bossy or (in the tiresome language of critics) \\"50's Ozzie and Harriet\\" as you can get.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the book is spent working out how the four divisions of manhood and the central thread of Initiative applies to various situations and people in a man's life. The chapter \\"Does Anyone Here Speak 'Woman'?\\" is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />I only have two very tiny negative comments about the book. First, the war-time metaphors and examples from Weber's own life as an Army Ranger won't appeal to everybody. For myself, I enjoyed reading them and they helped, but found it difficult to relate in a few cases because I my background isn't the same. One can't fault Weber that much, though: he simply wrote as who he is.<br /><br />Second, I think this book would be best with an older, more mature man alongside a younger one. (I am working with two younger men right now.) It might not impact a young man as strongly if given to him if he is not able to have an older (or at least same maturity level) man come alongside him. The obvious solution: be that older man. Don't just give it to your kids: work through it with them, and encourage them to work with their friends.<br /><br />I also bought the audio version of this book. I have two negative comments about the audio version. First, it's only available on cassette. I wanted to give somebody a copy of it, but he can only play CDs, so I had to buy it on cassette, rip it, and burn to CD. (Yes, I did this all legally.) That was a drag, and the resulting quality is rather low. Second, the audio version is not only shorter, but actually combines two chapters from the book (9 and 10). This makes it hard to track against the book. However, it is still a positive for those who are auditory learners and have more time to listen than to read. As most men probably fall into this category, I hope the publisher will consider bringing the audio version out on CD.<br /><br />In summary: get this book, read it, highlight it, re-read it, work through it with your friends. And watch God turn you into the man you know you were created to be.	2004-08-20

If you're thinking this now, please listen to me.<br />A year or so ago I heard about well-known and respected Christians like John MacArthur and Joni Eareckson Tada talk about how the old hymns were so meaningful to them and really strengthened their faith. That got me thinking: so it's not just stodgy old 80-year olds who love those old hymns. Maybe there's something to them after all.<br />So I got this book. And I have been so blessed by it. God has shown me that true worship is so much more than just a feeling. He wants all parts of me - my body, my soul, and my spirit - to be involved in worship. So many in churches today are satisfied with getting only their spirits involved; some want their body involved too (lifting hands, etc.); but the truly mature (I am coming to believe) also get their souls (or minds) involved. Your mind doesn't get involved when you just repeat &quot;Isn't He&quot; fifty times; it does when you sing (and really think about) the wonderful words to songs like &quot;O, the Deep, Deep Love of Jesus&quot; or &quot;I Know Whom I Have Believed.&quot;<br />These two songs and eight others are covered in this book. The four authors together make a very effective team, and generally write passages that use their own strong points. MacArthur (always the theologian) writes excellent Biblical exegeses behind the hymns. Joni writes messages full of feeling, often bringing in how she has felt as a quadroplegic and how God has taken her through the rough parts by showing her more and more of His grace. Robert Wolgemuth generally writes the histories, book publisher that he is. Finally, his wife Bobbie writes heartfelt reflections around the historical features and treats musical aspects from her point of view as a professional singer.<br />So, get it, sing the songs, think about what Christ has done for you, think about the circumstances of their writing. And take your worship to another level.	2004-02-02
US	53020162	RTYLJLPOLCV91	0020133405	38278387	Cassell's Concise Latin-English, English-Latin Dictionary	Books	4	15	17	N	Y	Good little dictionary	This is a good little Latin dictionary. It contains a variety of words used over the years, mostly focusing on classical Latin but including some from the ecclesiastical period. You can't expect to have every Latin word in here, because it's a very small format. The small format is very convenient, and the binding is good - I have used mine a great deal and the binding has held up very well.<br />I especially like the way they deal with variant forms of words, especially participles. They often list the participial forms of verbs separately (but under the same root verb heading, prefixed by the word &quot;Hence&quot;). Latin participles, of course, are very easily determined from the verbs, so it's not absolutely necessary; but the way they did it is tremendously helpful in two ways:<br />1. Sometimes the participle has a slightly different meaning or emphasis from the original verb. This allows them to separately distinguish the senses of the participle from the senses of the basic verb;<br />2. It is a tremendous boon to memorizing vocabulary. Very often, an English word has been taken almost letter-for-letter from the participle, while the original verb has not come across into English. (Example: the verb &quot;ago&quot; doesn't come across in English, but the participial form &quot;agens/agent&quot; does.) Relating the verb to the English is a great help in memorizing vocabulary.<br />My only real problem with this dictionary has to do with the size and printing. At this size, it is very difficult to distinguish the marks they use for long vs. short vowels. It would have been better to never mark short vowels, so you know that if it doesn't have a long vowel mark it's short. Sometimes you're left puzzling over whether a given vowel is long or short, not a good feature to have in a dictionary.<br />Other than this, it's an excellent book, and an excellent value.	2004-02-02

MacArthur presents a great deal of intelligent insights and background information, as well as outlining every chapter in the Bible. The outlines alone are worth the price of the Bible. His beginning-of-book summaries are the best I've seen, covering each book's author and date of writing, historical context, and even exegetical problems and theological issues.    About the New King James Version of the Bible: I started off as an NIV user (since that's the first Bible I ever really used). I had always felt the NKJV was sort of a crutch for people who couldn't understand the KJV but couldn't give up their King James forms. When I saw that MacArthur's study Bible was only available in the NKJV, that made me think again. Now I love this translation: it's both accurate and easy to read. I've read the evidence presented by King James Only advocates and, while I respect their sincerity, I am unconvinced that the NKJV is the Enemy's work.    For the reviewers who said that MacArthur only presents one point of view: isn't this what's expected? The whole purpose of a study Bible is that the author of that Bible's notes presents his understanding of Biblical passages, which you are then free to accept or reject (obviously, under wise council of other godly people and the control of the Holy Spirit). I have looked at many study Bibles, and they all do exactly that - Ryrie, Scofield, LaHaye, whoever. Does one expect LaHaye to provide evidence for preterism, or Ryrie for so-called \\"Lordship Salvation\\"? I am afraid that when other reviews say \\"he only presents one point of view\\" they really mean \\"he doesn't present MY point of view.\\" Besides, in the beginning-of-book \\"theological issues\\" sections MacArthur at least deals with other points of view, something that most others don't do.    A perfect example is the reviewer who mentioned 1 Corinthians 14. Obviously this fellow doesn't agree with MacArthur. Might I hazard a guess that the reviewer is charismatic? MacArthur appears to be a cessationist. But the point is that a study Bible is not the place to cover the issues in detail: if the commentary is not to overwhelm the Biblical text in quantity, probably the best that can be accomplished is to give one point of view. My advice would be to get a good book that covers those types of issues in detail: Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology does a good job of that (while also taking a particular point of view, somewhat different from MacArthur's).    I should note that I am not a cessationist nor a dispensationalist myself. I believe Spiritual Gifts are for today and all history. But, unlike another reviewer, to say cessationism \\"borders on REAL heresy\\" is far beyond what can reasonably be concluded from Scripture. \\"Christianity\\" as taught by people such as Charles Capps and Frederick Price, yes: cessationalism, no.    In sum, if you're looking for a new Bible that you'll love for years to come, get the MacArthur Study Bible. Whether you agree with everything you read or not (I don't), you will find the notes well thought out and helpful.	2004-02-02

US	53020162	RM78INX80WZX1	0310250870	179234898	Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar	Books	5	172	173	N	Y	Perfect NT Greek grammar for the self-learner	This is an excellent NT Greek grammar. Unlike some Greek grammars (notably Hansen and Quinn's Attic grammar, one I have experience with), this is ideally suited for the self-learner. Here's why:<br />- Mounce tries to minimize the amount of memorization required. Greek is a difficult language, no two ways about it: but the way the material is presented can make learning easier or harder. For those of us who come at it as adults, memorization is difficult. Some grammars require massive amounts of rote memorization; Mounce takes instead the tack of giving you a number of rules to apply, then only requiring memorization where the rules don't apply. Using this method, the amount of memorization is cut dramatically, and the effort required is reduced accordingly.<br />- To ease the remaining memorization, Mounce includes lots of good vocabulary helps. Unfortunately, vocabulary acquisition is usually another rote memorization affair. Mounce includes either derivations or cognates in other languages (drawing in some cases on Metzger's &quot;Lexical Aids for Students of New Testament Greek&quot;), or silly little memorization aids. An example of the latter is Mounce's memorable word play on the word ELPIS (=&quot;hope&quot;): &quot;Some people HOPE that ELVIS did not die.&quot; I think I can safely say I will never forget the meaning of ELPIS.<br />- In many ways (including the previous two items) Mounce includes the fruit of his years of experience as a teacher of New Testament Greek. Many books that I'm sure would be just fine when learning from a professor completely fall apart when an autodidact (like myself) attempts to use them. With this book, it's almost as good as Mounce being right there.<br />- Although I would not have believed it, Mounce has successfully integrated devotional sections at the beginning of most chapters. A combination textbook/devotional? Yes, believe it or not. The section for chapter 10, for example, is simply amazing - building off John 1:14,KAI hO LOGOS SARX EGENETO (&quot;And the Word became flesh.&quot;) This answers another big problem for autodidacts, which is that you don't have much of an inducement to continue when the going gets tough. These devotional sections (I am assuming a Christian student, of course) add greatly to your experience and make you look forward to new chapters.<br />The end result is that this book makes it possible to learn New Testament Greek on your own to just about the same depth as you would get at a seminary. That's an amazing feat in itself.<br />But be aware, this book has no exercises in it. Rather, you need to buy the companion workbook, which has all the exercises.	2004-01-28

If you're looking for a book that describes the hand(s) used in the Book of Kells (i.e. a book on paleography rather than calligraphy), this book isn't it. Let me 'splain.<br /><br />When I first started learning the celtic hand, after some early exercises (from Margaret Shepherd's excellent book \\"Learn Calligraphy\\") I decided I'd follow historical precedent and learn more accurate Book of Kells hands. (This worked well for me in Gothic capitals, for example.) So I attempted to start by copying the Book of Kells hand; whereupon I ran into my first problem: the original had 3 different scribes with different styles. So, I picked one.<br /><br />My results were disappointing. After doing my best to exactly copy the hand, I found my lettering looked less \\"Celtic\\" than typical Celtic writing! For, despite the fact that the Book of Kells is considered the prototypical example of celtic celligraphy, enigmatically the hands used in the Book are actually not very \\"Celtic looking\\", at least to my modern eyes.<br /><br />Thus, I modified my style to be more \\"modern\\" - more like the style described in this book, in fact, which brings me back around to the book. This book gives a brief history of the Book of Kells and then uses the Book's hands as a starting point to develop a celtic script that is very nice. Many aspects of this hand were not used (or not used extensively) in the Book of Kells - for example, the angled upper serifs. But it is a very nice-looking (to me) hand, very celtic-looking, and truer to the Book of Kells hands than most other celtic calligraphy I've seen. Well worth the small price.	2003-10-30

And rightly so, because the head without the heart is fruitless, and the heart without the head is without knowledge.<br />Grudem gives excellent explanations of all his positions with solid Biblical backing. He balances this with personal applications in the lives of readers, and gives us &quot;hooks&quot; to supplement our worship and devotion. What a rare combination! Another thing that really makes this book excellent is that Grudem actually gives serious consideration to opposing points of view. It is true, he argues (using extensive Biblical citations) that those opposing points of view are wrong. But then, isn't that what he's supposed to do?<br />I cannot disagree more with the liberal reviewer from Liverpool, England, who panned this book because it takes a conservative theological position that is not &quot;relevant&quot; to people's lives. I suppose that some people might consider it irrelevant. Of course, the sad part is, it's more relevant for them than for anybody, if they would only admit it. &quot;Those that are well are not in need of a savior.&quot; Besides, Grudem specifically says in his introduction that it's not true that liberals have nothing worthwhile to say (although liberals might say that about him); all he says is that for his current purposes, he has to mostly discount the liberal positions. 1,200 pages is apparently not enough for some people. Finally, Grudem DOES enumerate some liberal positions; it's just that he proves them wrong (with solid Biblical backing).<br />It may take our friend from Liverpool by surprise, but I don't agree 100% with all the positions Grudem takes; but I appreciate how Grudem lays out the positions and their support. Within the Christian world, he includes not only Reformed positions, but also the positions of all the major branches of Christianity, including Dispensational, Arminian, Charismatic, and Roman Catholic. I dare say this is as wide-ranging a survey of these topics as you're likely to find in a single book.<br />In summary, this book isn't supposed to be a comprehensive survey of all possible points of view on all possible theological topics; &quot;all the books in the world could not hold&quot; that much. Rather, it is a very well-written and fairly comprehensive enumeration of topics of Christianity. I highly recommend it and read it almost daily.atholic.

Bluegrass music is one of the latter. And I get the feeling that, while the author clearly knows quite a lot ABOUT bluegrass music, he doesn't KNOW bluegrass music. (By the way, I say this knowing full well that Cantwell is a bluegrass player himself. I hate to say it, but this is clearly the impression I get.) He treats it, very skillfully, as a sociologist treats some group of people he's studying and perhaps has lived with, but internally feels disdain for.<br /><br />I got this feeling the most clearly in Cantwell's discussion of two important areas: Bill Monroe and gospel music. About Monroe, Cantwell seems to delight in pointing out his shortcomings and hypocracies. Everybody admits that he had both. But what doesn't come out in this book is Monroe's love for the music, for the people, and for the lifestyle that the music comes out of. Sure, what neither Monroe nor Earl Scruggs did was truly original; but the fact that they popularized it and shared it with millions of others (yes, making money along the way) doesn't make them evil people.<br /><br />Even worse is Cantwell's treatment of gospel music. I came away from the book with the distinct feeling that most bluegrass musicians use gospel music as a tool to dupe the suckers, and play it not so they can \\"use their Bible as a road map\\" but as a cash cow. While I admit that there are no doubt some bluegrass musicians who so use it (but who am I to judge their hearts?), it has been my experience that at least some bluegrass musicians I play with feel gospel songs deeply. We sing and play gospel music to express how we really feel about God, and we want to share that with others. In other words, when I play gospel music my goal is truly to share not only the gospel but also the Gospel. Perhaps that wasn't Cantwell's experience, but it is mine.<br /><br />In summary, this book is very learned, and the author clearly knows a lot and expresses it skillfully, but it leaves you feeling completely flat and uninterested about the music. If you're looking for a critical book that helps you know many facts about bluegrass music, this is it.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're looking for a book that helps you to both know bluegrass music and to love it better, I would suggest instead reading \\"Bluegrass: A History\\" by Neil V. Rosenberg. Rosenberg is a guy who not only knows his subject well (the book being apparently just as well researched and painstakingly footnoted as Cantwell's) but Rosenberg clearly has the kind of love for the music and the people that it seems Cantwell lacks. Rosenberg's book is the kind you treasure and re-read.ows a lot and expresses it skillfully, but it leaves you feeling completely flat and uninterested about the music.

Now, granted, she is a girl, so it goes easier than with most boys - but it really did work. We bought the doll the book suggests (i.e. the kid teaches the doll to go and ends up teaching themselves) but never really used it.<br />What really did it was my wife spending all day pumping drinks into her. Before you start, find something that she will drink a lot of - our initial assumption, apple juice, didn't work - she likes it but would only drink so much. We went through many different kinds of juices, finally finding some kind of blend (mango-papaya or something) that she'd actually drink reasonably large amounts of. <br />Then, it was just a matter of following her around, asking constantly, and putting her on the potty every ten minutes. <br />Result: By the end of the first day, she had gone several times (when you do it every 10 minutes it's hard to avoid :-), with only a couple of small accidents. Second day, she was telling us before she had to go. By a few days later, she was telling us when \\"number 2\\" time came around. Now, two weeks into it, she has no accidents and goes by herself. It's amazing - totally in diapers 2 weeks ago, and now she just walks off, puts the little potty seat adapter on the big toilet, climbs up and goes, and washes her hands, and all you hear is the flush. Amazing! <br />I should caveat all this by saying that she was showing us she was ready by telling us after she went in the diaper. If your kid doesn't even recognize that he/she has gone, maybe you should change to (ugh) cloth diapers - they say that they can feel it better that way, and the soiled diaper makes them uncomfortable. The only discomfort they get with Pampers is a little bit of \\"crystal butt.\\" :-)<br />BTW, if you're using the book, you may be distressed that they have very little about \\"number 2,\\" saying it'll just happen naturally. In our case, at least, it really did - but remember that she knew when number 2 was coming. With a kid who doesn't know what's happening, you probably won't have the same success we had.	2003-06-09

This book is almost perfect. She gives you so much more than alphabets: key exercises to do before you start the alphabets, typical beginner's problems (most of which I have experienced!), practice pages you can reproduce. Her sections on swashes and \\"accessorizing\\" Gothic capitals are also wonderful - what had always seemed highly mysterious to me turns out to be a matter of combining building blocks, creativity, and - who would have thought - a lot of fun.    One thing she does not do is to cover every hand imaginable. There are lots of books like that out there. Rather, she only covers a small number of hands, but covers them very thoroughly, with a special eye to us novices. For example, once I got the basic hands down, I found one of my main problems was spacing the letters. Nothing looks worse than inconsistent horizontal spacing. She gives good coverage to this important issue, for example suggesting that you step back and look at it from a distance. Try it - if you're a novice, you'll be surprised at how different (and maybe bad) it looks.    I also very much enjoy the samples of projects that she shows as examples of how to apply each hand. In this she highlights the talents of (I assume) her friends, and it adds to the book. Looking at alphabet after alphabet as is done in typical calligraphy books, you don't get a good feel for how you'd use each one, and variations you can apply. Her other book \\"Calligraphy Projects for Pleasure and Profit\\" (which I also have) gives you lots more along these lines, but the ones in this book are different and I find them just as valuable.    I even like the way she letters the whole book in her (what she admits is slightly idiosyncratic) italic hand. You want examples - there's a whole book-length example. I don't agree with the other reviewer that this detracts from the book. It's as if she does it because it's fun - an important thing to remember when you're doing the drudgery of straight lines or circles.    The only tiny drawback, if it is one, is that the book doesn't contain a lot that is good to know about techniques of setting up a drawing table, selling, etc. For that (as well as an excellent chapter on type design by Hermann Zapf himself), the book \\"Calligraphy and Illumination\\" provides more than you ever wanted to know. I don't think that book replaces this one, however. I find Margaret's explanations well worth the small amount this book costs, and she is much more complete. She'll even autograph it for you (see her web site for details).    This is a wonderful book that every calligraphy student should have. If you can only have one, this is it.	2003-06-09

Or at least that it was their perseverence, not their process, that finally triumphed. This book completely put these ideas to rest. It shows how the Wright brothers' success was due to taking some basic correct ideas, applying a step-by-step thinking process, and a lot of hard work.<br />First, it explains how they started with an idea that was somehow missed by many of the other pioneers: flying experience is vitally important. This was combined with another idea: that airplanes were basically the same whether powered or gliders. To those who have studied aeronautics to any extent, this is not surprising, but many others seemed to be of the idea that powered airplanes and gliders were completely different beasts. Thus, while others were building bigger, more powerful, and more expensive machines, the Wrights were experimenting with actually flying gliders, to learn how to fly them.<br />This had two good results: (1) they actually learned how to fly, so that when they built the final plane they knew how to fly without crashing the first time a gust of wind came up; (2) not having that engine to pull them through the air and having to depend on gliding, they discovered one of the most important facts of all flight: lift-to-drag ratio. (This means how much drag a wing generates for a given amount of lift.) Low L/D meant their glider didn't go very far; thus, to get longer glider flights, they HAD to figure out a way to increase L/D.<br />At this point, the engineering process kicked in, and they realized they didn't have the foggiest notion of how to increase L/D. Thus, they realized they had to do lots of experiments with airfoils to see which had the highest L/D: the wind tunnel was born (or at least weaned).

First, the print is large and very readable. No question about whether you're looking at rough or a smooth breathing marks, for example.    Second, the textual apparatus is rather daunting but fascinating. It really lets you see why certain words are included or excluded from certain translations based on the original text. It also has a good intro listing the various sources used in the apparatus; to those who have little or no background in textual criticism this is invaluable to understanding what you're looking at and, in general, the unprecedented range of manuscript evidence for the New Testament. If you think the New Testament is the product of the fourth century church, you'll think again after reading through the apparatus (which is why no reputable scholar holds that opinion).    Finally, the dictionary in the back is quite good for its small size, separately listing many of the principal parts of verbs. One of the toughest parts of reading the Greek NT (especially for a student of Greek like myself) has to be parsing verbs you don't recognize, and this makes the task much easier.    Postscript: There has been a review that says that this is \\"really\\" the NA27. Well, it's not. There are two distinct common versions of the Greek NT: NA27 and UBS4. This book is the latter. The actual text is identical: the difference is in the critical apparatus. Which is better? It depends on your purposes. If you are doing detailed historical studies where you need to know the maximum amount about the various manuscripts of the NT, then buy the NA27. It has a wealth of information on each page that covers virtually every existing variant.    But for most of us, who primarily want the text and would like to understand the most significant variants, buy this edition. I have found the text of this UBS4 version easier to read, and the apparatus MUCH easier to read. The arcane coding system used by the NA27, while necessary tofit so much information into a manageable size, makes it much harder to use for the average user.	2003-04-23
US	53020162	R2LCMZTRLIJT0G	0310951410	243093313	Amplified Bible	Books	5	26	29	N	N	Great second or third Bible	I thoroughly concur with the other reviewers that said this should be your second or third Bible version, not your first one. I use the New King James as my primary Bible version and NIV when I want a freer translation. The Amplified Bible fills in all the gaps. Anybody who is at all familiar with the process of translation knows that often it's very difficult to express a concept wrapped up in one word of one language into one word of another language. To fully express many single words from Greek, for example, can require 3, 4, 5 English words since there are nuances of meaning (and in some cases we are not 100% sure which one is applicable). (I don't mean to imply that any doctrines of Christianity are in doubt - they're not. The nuances are not that important. But they do give you a different flavor of some parts of the text.)<br />The reason most translators don't take those 3-5 words is that the resulting translation is almost unreadable. You need to read it very slowly, one phrase at a time. Most translations don't do this because they are aiming at both accuracy and readability. (I'm speaking of reliable translations here, not biased ones like &quot;inclusive&quot; versions or the &quot;New World Translation&quot; of the Jehovah's Witnesses.)<br />The Amplified Bible takes the other approach: fully list all possible nuances, and let the reader sort it out. As a result, the Amplified Bible is virtually impossible to read the way you would read a novel. But if you want to explore the nuances of one verse at a time, it's probably the next best thing to knowing the original languages.<br />The reviewer who said that we have too many Bible translations clearly has a King James only point of view. His intentions are excellent, of course, but his criticisms are off-base.	2003-04-23

He gives a good deal of derivation information, which is very valuable. Note to fellow Greek students: even though your book may include all the vocabulary you need, you should still get this book right away. One of the hardest thing about learning languages (at least for me) is memorizing vocabulary, and having the derivations makes it much easier. Example: the word PROSWPON (face). Mounce gives the memorable phrase &quot;Pour soap on&quot; as a mnemonic; but even more helpful to me was Thayer's explanation that PROSWPON is derived from PROS+OPS=&quot;what's in front of your eyes.&quot; Another one: ENOPION (before). Thayer explains it comes from EN+OPS=&quot;in the eyes of&quot;. Beautiful.<br />Another thing I especially like is how he relates many Greek words to words in other languages, not just English. For example, &quot;IDE&quot; could be defined as look, behold, etc; but Thayer would give the helpful hint &quot;Latin: ecce&quot;. Where useful, he also lists equivalents for some words in German, French, etc.<br />The only drawback is that it's an reprint of an old (1880?) text, so some of the print is a little hard to read, and some of the references are hard to figure out and then to find. But, especially for the money, it's a great tool.	2003-04-21

Every word in the Bible is indexed. Also includes Hebrew and Greek dictionaries that have some very good information on derivations. If you are a student of Greek or Hebrew as I am, I can tell you that having these derivations is a great aid in memorizing vocabulary, which is the hardest part of language learning for me. Anything that can make it easier is a great blessing.<br />It is also very useful for the general student of the Bible. It provides definitions and cross-references of all word usages. The only thing that's a little hard to use is the \\"little words\\" listing - words like \\"the\\", \\"in\\", etc. They are listed separately, and that was done because of space reasons. My only gripe is in some of the words they included in this list, for example, \\"in\\". As a preposition I would consider that to be a pretty important word, and to relegate it to the hard-to-use brief index rather than the easy-to-use main concordance makes it much more difficult on us.<br />The other thing is that serious students of Greek and Hebrew will want to have a more scholarly reference. Strong's is not considered really scholarly by many, and I must admit that they do things that I wish they wouldn't (for example, they don't differentiate between different forms of words, they jump lump them all together). Serious students of the original languages will want something more. But, note that I say \\"in addition to\\": I still like Strong's since it's classic, and is helpful to me in general Bible study as well as detailed language study.<br />For the price (or even price-per-pound: this sucker weighs a ton!), it is an outstanding value.	2003-02-25

This shortcoming is completely covered by this workbook. Of course, the workbook is almost useless without the grammar - so you need to buy both. This is even explained in the intro to the grammar: The two complement each other, the grammar providing the deductive descriptions of grammar, the workbook providing inductive readings. The two parts together are powerful and compelling.<br />Thus, the workbook consists primarily of readings - and all from the New Testament. Unlike some grammars, Mounce gives you the NT text right from the beginning. Unfamiliar words are glossed in the text. While this is a little jarring at first, my advice is to get used to it. Even after you graduate from learning Greek (or any language) and move on to &quot;real&quot; readings, you'll come upon lots of unfamiliar words. Even then, it'll be a process to stop reading, look up the word, and figure out how it fits in the sentence. I'm not an expert in Greek, but know Latin reasonably well, and I can tell you that very often I'll have to do this same thing reading &quot;real&quot; Latin texts.<br />So, I think Mounce's method is to get you used to doing this process right from the beginning. I believe this is a good idea - sometimes I wish my Latin learning had used this method.	2003-02-21
US	53020162	R1RXMSA8ADZJR2	052144747X	119002263	Reading Medieval Latin	Books	3	39	46	N	Y	Good post-Wheelock book	I might as well start by saying that this book is by no means an introduction to Latin. Sidwell himself starts out by saying that, by and large, Medieval Latin is just Latin. It's best to start with a solid background in classical Latin (Wheelock's) and then move to this book when you want to start reading Medieval authors.<br />As another review noted, Sidwell gives good backgrounds on the changes that occurred in medieval Latin - again, medieval Latin is not some other language, it's simply Latin with some changes in orthography, grammar, and usage. In fact, without a solid background in classical Latin, this book would be almost worthless (except for its dictionary in the back - and even there, most words are defined in terms of their classical Latin equivalents).<br />Best of all is the appendix with the changes between classical and medieval Latin categorized. I refer to this appendix often when I come to an odd construct in the Vulgate, and it very often answers my questions.<br />I unfortunately have limited experience with the texts in the book themselves. What little I've looked through seem good, and the introductions are useful; but I've heard several negative comments about some of Sidwell's text choices (one person whom I respect said his choice of texts was \\"ghoulish\\".)<br />But, from my own personal experience, it's a good book as long as you don't try to use it for more than it's designed to do.	2003-02-21

Dobson does just call homosexuality a disorder: he documents why he believes this to be true. And there are a substantial number of phychiatrists and psychologists who believe similarly. Dobson quotes the original APA votes from the early 70s to show that even at that time, there was nothing like unanimous agreement within the psychiatric/psychological establishment. Since then, little has changed in the realm of science: only public opinion has changed, influenced by ...the media.<br />About the book, it is generally a very thoughtful discussion of the special attention that bringing up boys requires. Now, everybody (including Dobson, right in the forward) admits that bringing up girls have special problems too. Dobson wrote the book because the problems of bringing up boys are seldom discussed or even admitted to exist.<br />Another point is that Dobson is a very compassionate person. Whether he has an \\"agenda\\" or not, anybody who reads much that Dobson writes knows that he has a great deal of love and compassion for those he writes about, even for those who he disagrees with. (Would that certain book reviewers would have the same compassion.) He really does love the people he's talking about, and that love comes through in his books. \\"Hating the sin but loving the sinner\\" is not just possible, Dobson practices it.<br />If I have a negative comment about the book, it's that Dobson does not give much coverage to the boys who do not fit the typical \\"boy mold.\\" He mentions several times that not all boys are the rough-and-tumble type of boy, that quieter or more sensitive boys were made that way by God just as much as the prototypical boy was, and God can use them all to His glory. And I believe that he believes this sincerely. But it seems almost like an add-on to the rest of the text that's not really explored as much as it could be. I think some people who have boys that do not fit the typical mold will end up feeling discouraged when their son doesn't match up to the type described again and again.<br />But overall, it's an excellent book that gives practical tips to loving parents, grandparents, and friends.	2003-01-13

So far, my expectation has been completely fulfilled!<br />The good points of this book are:<br />1. It provides lots of practice with reading Greek sentences. Lots of practice is the only way to become fluent in any language, and this book provides it. To me this is the book's primary good point (but see #4 below).<br />2. As the other reviews say, it gets you into the language right away with few technical details<br />3. It is highly inductive, meaning it doesn't go thru lists of paradigms and rules, but gets you right into reading the text.<br />4. This book has the only really good explanation of preposition usage I've seen. They all - including Mounce - show the little boxes with arrows: eis, en, ex, hypo, etc. This is useful as far as it goes. But this book does something I've never seen: it gives multiple examples from the New Testament for each possible meaning of each preposition. For example, most books say \\"en\\" means \\"in, with, or by\\"; but this book gives you actual NT examples of \\"en\\" meaning each of these. Wonderful!<br />The bad points are:<br />1. It is highly inductive. I don't think this kind of learning style suits me as an adult at all. True, the deductive method is different from how we learned language as children. Proponents of inductive learning (such as Prof. Harris in his sometimes interesting alternative Latin grammar) always point this out and state without proof that everybody knows the inductive method is superior. And for children, they're probably right. However, we *were* children then. I think it a fairly well-established fact that children learn differently from adults: and the classical schooling model has been based on this fact for 25 centuries. As a result, based both on reason and my own experience, I don't believe that a purely inductive method is the proper framework for adultsto learn in; but then I have not surveyed all adults nor performed a controlled experiment on them all. What I think I can say with certainty is that it's not the right framework for *ME* to learn in, and I doubt I'm alone.<br />2. Going further than most NT grammars (even Mounce to some extent) that don't really explain accentuation rules, this book ignores accents altogether! (It doesn't even print them in the text.) I am still \\"coasting\\" on the accentuation rules I learned early and very thoroughly from Hansen and Quinn's Attic Greek book (H&Q does at least one thing right), and I find they really do help. Without even accents printed in the text, I question whether you can get good consistent accent placement, making it much more difficult to talk to others or probably even to remember the words yourself. I naturally find myself using Latin-like accent rules, which is sometimes correct (i.e. present tense of many verbs) but usually goes horribly wrong for nouns and adjectives. Since I have Mounce's grammar also, everytime I find a new word in Dobson's book, I write in the accent. It's a good test for my own understanding, but it shouldn't be necessary.<br />I believe these problems would make this book not work for me as a stand-alone way of learning Greek. But for somebody who is using another grammar such as Mounce and using this book as a side reading source that gives you lots of practice and another point of view, this book is very useful.	2003-01-06

You have your Wheelock's, and Wheelock/LaFleur's explanations are not quite clear. What do you do?<br />Professor Grote to the rescue! He picks up where Wheelock leaves off and often approaches explanations from another angle. Don't get me wrong - Wheelock's and (especially) LaFleur's experience as Latin teachers comes through in their explanations. But the great virtue of Grote's book is that he can assume that the basic explanation and vocabulary has already been given in Wheelock, so he can focus on explanations that may help those of us who &quot;just don't get it.&quot;<br />To be sure, Rick LaFleur adds some of these to Wheelock too, but Wheelock's would have to be 1,000 pages long to give this much explanation, and not all explanations are needed by all students. I did not need some of Grote's alternate explanations - but I'm sure somebody did. As an example, Wheelock explains the imperfect subjunctive as being &quot;essentially&quot; the present infinitive plus personal endings (essem/esses/esset/essemus/essetis/essent). Grote explains what Wheelock meant by &quot;essentially&quot;. Perhaps not absolutely necessary to know, but a good way of remembering it.<br />The only thing I would change about this book is to have more vocabulary explanations. There are many vocabulary puzzles in Latin or any other language, and Grote helps with some of these (I love his line &quot;Wheelock gives 'thing' as the primary definition of 'res' - well, forget that.&quot;) However, the ones included are few and far between, and in some cases I am sure that better and more necessary ones could be chosen.<br />But this is only a minor nit. This book is great, and I highly recommend that anybody who really wants to learn Latin through Wheelock's should get it. If you are still not sure, you can download an early version of Grote's notes (just do an Internetsearch for &quot;grote wheelock study guide&quot; and you'll find them). These are good for getting the flavor of Grote's book - for example in chapter 7: &quot;Many people consider the third declension to be a pons asinorum - but I disagree.&quot;<br />The on-line version will keep you going until your purchased version arrives. But do buy the book - the on-line version has typos, and is for an old edition of Wheelock's, and only goes up to chapter 35. Besides, with such great explanations, I want to do everything I can to encourage Professor Grote!	2002-11-06

I had seen a few matches on Fox Sports World, and was interested in actually learning something about the sport.<br />So I acquired this book. I have stumbled (I might say accidentally, as it was the only rugby book my local library branch had on the shelf) on a fantastic book about learning the game of rugby.<br />I started out by picking and choosing through the book like I would with most books, but quickly became lost in a dense forest of strange terminology. Rucks, mauls, line-outs, scrums, knock-ons, etc. So I started over from the beginning, and found the book delightfully easy to read, and quite explanatory. I would recommend that anybody new to rugby do the same thing. It has a huge number of great pictures, (many of them of Jonah Lomu, All-Black and now Wellington Hurricane). The pictures explain what's going on quite well. In less than a month, I knew at least as much about the game of rugby than my Australian friend who has been watching it for years (as he himself admits). It allows you to quickly scale the wall of terminology and get on to the meat of the game.<br />Speaking of the meat of the game, it also has a good dose of strategy. NOTE: Somebody expressed their disappointment at my review misleading him. I apologize for that, but let me be clear: I was a complete rugby novice when I read this book, not knowing the difference between a scrum and a line-out. They provide strategy useful for the kind of complete tyro that I was; what was useful for me at the time would not be for a rugby player. Some examples: in describing knock-ons it suggests when you shouldn't even try to catch the ball, and what to do instead. It also, in describing the different types of passes, talks about which would be most useful and when, and describes the role of the scrum-half. And I finally, thanks to this book's clear descriptions, understand why they always kick penalty kicks from inside their own 22 directly into touch.<br />I only have a few minor gripes with the book. First, it is not at all clear on penalties. It has the standard list of laws in the back, which is good, but it does not explain the laws other than that. In almost every other area of the game, its clear and descriptive text really makes the rules themselves jump out at you. There is also not even a one-page pictures of official's hand signals, which would be useful to those of us who watch games and wonder \\"so what's he calling now?\\"<br />Second, although it has a plethora of pictures, it does not have a single picture of a ruck. Since the difference between rucks and mauls and the associated strategies is rather important, it would have been useful to see at least one picture of what one actually looks like. And given the otherwise clear and helpful use of pictures I am surprised to find this shortcoming. (My Australian friend is also somewhat confused about rucks and mauls so I have to think confusing the distinction is not unusual. I would like to know the difference, however.) Hopefully in future editions this will be cleared up.<br />Finally, it would be useful to give an overview of the different types and leagues of rugby played. For example, the book is completely about Rugby Union (although it does not use the term), but it would be useful to at least admit that Rugby League exists and basically distinguish it from Union. To anybody who really knows rugby, of course, there is no confusion (my Australian friend was somewhat baffled at my confusion - \\"Why, they're completely different games!\\") but I think to newcomers the distinction needs to be made clear. It also doesn't give a lot of description of different teams and groups (\\"what's a Wallaby?\\"). To somebody who wants an overall introduction to the game and has not been around rugby all his life, descriptions along these lines would be very useful.<br />Other than these small nits, this isa great book and I highly recommend it to anybody wanting to learn about the game.a great book and I highly recommend it to anybody wanting to learn about the game.	2002-04-10

It's certainly not an apologetic book (as C.S. Lewis said, one can't always be defending the faith, sometimes one has to encourage those already converted), but elements of Christianity do come through (especially Chesterton's sensible view that your faith should affect every area of your life and outlook to the world).<br />The hero, Symes (who is called Thursday) is a detective and a Christian who provokes an anarchist and infiltrates a world-wide underground anarchist society. From there, I won't spoil the story but there are many adventures, twists, and turns. This part I thought very well written. Every new discovery Symes makes literally had me on the edge of my seat. Things become more and more bizarre (right in line with Chesterton's own description of his book as a &quot;Nightmare&quot;) until a very bizarre ending that I confess I have still not fully absorbed.<br />There is a great deal of symbolism and allegory in the book, which is not clear until at least a third of the way through the book. In this way, the book is similar to C.S. Lewis's book &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (the third book in his space trilogy that includes &quot;Perelandra&quot;). Like Lewis's book, &quot;Thursday&quot; starts off very realistic (although with some hints of the bizarre twists to come) and gets more and more strange as the book goes on.<br />Two things that will be helpful to understanding much of the symbolism:<br />(1) Read the afterword at the end of the book by Chesterton. Unlike Amis's introduction, I wouldn't read it before you start reading the book. I'd recommend reading it after about a third of the book, perhaps right around the time the Pole is &quot;unmasked&quot; (that is, around chapter 6).<br />(2) Also helpful is Martin Gardner's commentary on the book. There is another edition of the book that has Gardner's comments, but the most important parts of his commentary are available on the Internet (just search ye shall find them). This lays out the symbolism in more detail than the former, so if you want to figure it out for yourself don't read this until the end of the book.<br />Finally, after you read through the book once, think about it and read comments such as Gardner's, then go back and read it again. As Amis says in his introduction, you can read this book many times and get new things out of it every time.the Pole is &quot;unmasked&quot; (that is, around chapter 6).<br />(2) Also helpful is Martin Gardner's commentary on the book.

One thing that I really like (although it was slightly annoying at first, it grew on me) was Wheelock's insistence on relating every English word with Latin roots back to the Latin. (Kind of reminds you of \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" where the father keeps saying \\"X comes from the Greek word Y ... there you go.\\") For example, in chapter 12 it introduces the perfect tenses; the footnote notes that this comes from \\"per + factus\\". It really makes you understand where our words come from, even (perhaps especially) words that we use so often, we take them for granted - like \\"perfect\\" - and gives you a new appreciation for how indebted English is to Latin.<br />I would certainly agree with one thing that I have seen in other reviews: read every part of this book carefully. Everything in the main part (the chapters) is important. In fact, in this way, it shows its roots (as a set of study notes originally distributed to Latin classes by Wheelock).<br />The book, like many grammars, doesn't have a huge number of original Latin readings during the course. The later editions fix this somewhat with the addition of the translation sections to each chapter. But I would recommend you get another source of readings to be used, such as the companion book Workbook for Wheelock's Latin or Groton and May's 38 Latin Stories (or better, buy both).<br />This book takes sort of a middle ground when it comes to teaching grammar. On the one hand, there is the pure inductive method (which some of the people who gave this book bad reviews favor). For a young child, pure induction makes sense; but for an adult, I don't think it does at all. True, I learned English by induction; but I'm an adult now. I learn differently than I did then. On the other hand, there is a morphological type of approach, where you learn only a few forms and a set of rules to apply those forms. I actually think this method works very well, but Wheelock's doesn't take it.<br />Wheelock's takesthe traditional deductive memorization route of teaching, which was more difficult for me than it could have been. It has its detractors, but many, many adults have successfully been taught Latin over the years using this method, which is something you can't say for the others.<br />I cannot agree with those other reviewers who say that LaFleur's attempts at humor (such as the \\"Latina est gaudium\\" sections) take away from the book. On the contrary, though some of the puns are quite bad (I think Dr. LaFleur would agree :-) I found them enjoyable and a nice break from serious language study.<br />Two other cautions about the book:<br />1. When I first started, I didn't pay as much attention to the exercises in the back as I should have. Don't make the same mistake I did! Assiduously (\\"ad + sedere\\" - see, it's catching?) do the exercises! If you just skim the chapters, as I did at first, you will not get it! I think at least some of the negative reviews were from people trying to get by doing the minimum possible work, which means not doing the exercises. You get out of it what you put into it.<br />2. You may have to come up with some of your own devices to help memorize the endless tables of conjugations (\\"com + iugare\\"), etc. For example, I was completely (\\"com + plere\\" - ok, I won't do it any more) stumped until I made myself a sheet with \\"hic, haec, hoc, huius, ... ille, illa, illud ... etc.\\" randomly laid out and spent about an hour going through that sheet. (This is not so much a criticism of this book as of the complexity of Latin in the first place.)<br />One more hint: unless you really, really have to, don't spend a lot of your brain cells on memorizing positions of long and short vowels. Unless you're planning on writing a lot of Latin (mostly poetry), it's just not that important. If you recognize vowel length and how it affects accent, that's enough for most people. (I am not counting in this fortunate group (a) people who are taking Latin for credit or(b) people who want to teach Latin. They probably have to learn the vowel lengths.)	2001-12-28

Books	5	53	60	N	N	Excellent book on so-called &quot;lordship salvation&quot;	This was the first book by John MacArthur I read several years ago as a new Christian and it clearly explains why so-called &quot;Lordship salvation&quot; is Biblical. I put it in quotes because it is not so called by MacArthur but but opponents of it who believe that a non-commital (even flippant) intellectual agreement to the facts of the Gospel constitute true saving faith in Christ.<br />I also appreciate MacArthur's sensitive treatment of men like Charles Ryrie, L.S. Chafer, and Zane Hodges (all of the anti-&quot;Lordship salvation&quot; side). He disagrees with this teaching while affirming that they have all done great service to the body of Christ; it reminds me of how Charles Haddon Spurgeon strongly disagreed with Wesley's arminian teachings while affirmed the latter's obvious love for Christ, tireless efforts on His behalf, and service to His body. It is unfortunate that not all Christian leaders can have as tender a spirit as Dr. MacArthur clearly has.<br />I do not know MacArthur personally, but would be proud to.	2001-09-17

Lewis wrote, including letters to the editor, all three space novels, Till We Have Faces, and many others. One thing I really enjoy is seeing how bits from one work will spill over into others, and how each writing reflects on his life. I have read the Pilgrim's Regress now 4 times, and every time I see more in it. And not just about Lewis: about the development of thought up throught the years between the wars.<BR>Overall, this is a book that is well worth reading. It gives the best explanation I've seen (better than Surprised by Joy, IMO) of his idea of Joy, and of the &quot;Island&quot; (image from Regress) that drove him to finally find Christ. Passages from the &quot;Heaven&quot; chapter of The Problem of Pain are close, but I thought in Regress he uses the allegory of the Island most effectively to explain his concept of longing and Joy.<BR>At first, I must admit, Regress is difficult to understand for somebody without much background in fiction or allegory such as myself, and without much background in the philosophical movements of pre-war Europe. There are, however, two things in the book that are very helpful: (1) the afterword where Lewis explains his background; and (2) the explanatory headings on the tops of the pages that track the allegory.<BR>Lewis said he wasn't sure this was a good idea of his, but I don't agree. Now, even not being a student of allegory, I would not read the headings first, or even primarily (as a kind of Cliff's Notes of the book). Read that way, they detract from the book. Rather, I read the whole book through the first time without the headings; only then, after I finished a section, going back and reading the headings on that section. Kind of like reading the Cliff's Notes along with the book itself; very useful, but hardly anybody does it.	2001-08-29

This book is the best description of how to do the &quot;aviate&quot; part I've ever seen. True, it was written in 1943. But, then again, airplanes fly according to pretty much the same principles as they did back then.<br />Be aware - Langeweische doesn't spend a lot of time on theory. I like his approach: &quot;Bernoulli - forget it.&quot; He concentrates more on practical issues. But, to him, practical issues include a pretty in-depth knowledge of angle of attack. His description of Angle of Attack and the Working Speeds of an Airplane were revolutionary in my understanding of how an airplane flies, and how to fly it in each flight condition (glide, cruising flight, climb, power on descent, etc.)<br />One more feature (advantage or drawback, depending on your point of view): it gives you clear instruction on how to fly a tail dragger. You won't find that much of any place else.	2001-08-10

This is a typical baseless and meaningless ad hominem charge (right up there with &quot;homophobic&quot;). I know a bit about the authors and they don't have an anti-Semitic bone in their bodies.<br />As for the eschatologic comments, well, if you are pretribulational this is basically what you believe. If you are a strict Calvinist (or otherwise amillenial, or post-trib) you don't. Many people believe one way, and many people believe the other. It's as simple as that. I wouldn't say one view is &quot;waning&quot; making way for another.	2001-06-06

I had tried to read things on the market before, but never could get through them. I was always intimidated by the market. Wade Cook seems to have the ability to explain things in a simple manner. Furthermore, to a person who already knows the market, his books can give some ideas of how to make more money. Most people don't know much about options, for example, and he gives some basic information about them as well as option position strategies (covered calls, long calls and puts, etc.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's where the good part ends. The first problem is that he simplifies everything, making it seem as if you can easily make lots of money using his methods. I have lost money with his methods, and even made some money. If you read his books, you get the idea that if you follow his methods exactly, you'll make lots of money. He doesn't tell you that many people have attempted to follow his methods, and lost lots of money (way more than I have).<br /><br />This leads to the second problem: he does not really explain his methods. He says: know your exit point before you get in. That's fine, but what should your exit be? He gives little or no help there. He says: buy rolling stocks, ones that go through cycles from low to high and back again. Fine, but how do you identify them? Conveniently, you can pay him $3,000 per year for his on-line service and they'll identify some candidates. But there are so many identified, it's hard to know which ones will work and which won't.<br /><br />Overall, my biggest concern (and it is a concern) is that you'd think it was the easiest thing in the world to make lots of money in the stock market. When everything was going up in the late 90s, you probably could do it; certainly not today.<br /><br />In summary, his books are good for two kinds of people: (1) people who know nothing about the stock market and need a relatively painless introduction, but who are smart enough not to believe everything they read. (2) The fortunate few who have a gift for the stock market, who know all the risks and just need some new ideas. But please don't go into the market thinking that by simply following his methods you'll make a lot of money: unless you're already quite experienced, or read lots of other stuff, or are unusually naturally gifted, you probably won't.nd need a relatively painless introduction, but who are smart enough not to believe everything they read.

He clearly describes why markets act the way they do, and, in the process, gets you thinking about your own trading.  While he does talk about trading techniques (heavy on the technicals, thus people who like to think of themselves as &quot;value&quot; investors might not like this part), one of the main points he makes is that you can succeed with almost *ANY* trading system, if you know your own weak points and don't get wrapped up emotionally in the market.  A coach (perhaps many) once said, &quot;the best way to win is not to lose.&quot;  Elder gives great food for thought that, primarily, helps you to win by avoiding losing.  Whether you're a value trader or a momentum trader, &quot;not losing&quot; is a good idea	1997-08-22
