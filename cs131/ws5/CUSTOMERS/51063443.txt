I knew that Tocqueville was a great thinker, but I thought that his life would be boring (are thoughts worth being told? Yes, this book indeed proves it). However, the author manages to narrate Tocqueville's life and times in such a way that I could not put it down, and read it in less than a week's time. So I may not think of a better book to commemorate Tocqueville's bicentennial anniversary and I fully agree and endorse, as my own, the other reviewer's opinion.	2005-07-29

The diabolic character of Wutong illustrates that transactions with the divine realm remained fraught with uncertainty, the Wutong cult arising as much as from fear of the god's wrath and malice as from hope of securing its aid. Although China's religious culture did not simply mirror the social order and its essential values, by examining the ever-changing world of vernacular religion we can catch a glimpse of how the lives and thoughts or ordinary Chinese were conditioned by the times they lived in, given that the conception of the divine realm in Chinese vernacular religion was very much a product of active effort by ordinary people to make sense of, and gain control over, their lives, and that conformity to the state's and ecclesiastic authorities' standards of religious belief and practice remained superficial.<br /><br />All that (and much more that I do not mention in this summary) is developed in 321 pages (footnotes included), the book being divided in the following chapters: Introduction; 1. Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods in Ancient China; 2. The Han cult of the Dead and Salvific Religion; 3. Shanxiao: Mountain Goblins; 4. Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods.; 5. The Song Transformation of Chinese Religious Culture; 6. Wutong: From Demon to Deity; 7. The Enchantment of Wealth; Conclusion.<br /><br />Besides, the book is not a difficult reading (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 4 to 3).<br /><br />Other books I would recommend reading are the following:\\"In Search of Personal Welfare: A View of Ancient Chinese Religion \\" by Mu-Chou Poo(excellent too, but not at all engaging); \\"The Phenomenon of Religion\\", by Moojan Momen; \\"Vampires, Burial, and Death : Folklore and Reality\\" by Paul Barber; \\"Ecstasies: Deciphering the witches' Sabbath\\", by Carlo Ginzburg; and \\"Shamans, Sorcerers, and Saints: A Prehistory of Religion\\" by Brian Hayden.	2005-07-17

Nicholas Ostler has confined himself to languages that have been written down and which have spread geographically. They include Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian, Chinese, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and the main European languages.    Of the approximately 7,000 language communities in the world today, more than half have fewer than 5,000 speakers, and 1,000 fewer than a dozen: many will be extinct within a generation. At the top of the 20 global languages is Mandarin Chinese, which has 1.052 billion speakers, more than twice as many as the next highest, English, with 508 million. Third is Hindi with 487 million and fourth Spanish, with 417 million. How have these linguistic communities been created? Why have some flourished while others languished?     From the author's picture, it is clear that there is no single model. The most important factors in the spread of languages have generally been conquest, migration, economic might and religion. But to succeed, what a language needs above all is prestige, or the ability to attract speakers.    Besides looking back to the origins of the written word, Ostler speculates about the future. In 50 years, he argues, Chinese will probably still be the most widely spoken language, while English, at least as a native language, might have stagnated.     Ostler´s writing is easily readible and he keeps things going with plenty of anecdotes and interesting facts. So I daresay that this is a book that can be savoured by the professional historian and educated layperson alike. Besides, the book is not a difficult read (content: 5 starts; pleasure: 4 to 5).    Additionally, as a complement to \\"Empires of the Word\\", I would also suggest reading the following works, whose scope is as amazingly global as Ostler's: 1. Agrarian cultures: \\"Pre-industrial societies\\" by Patricia Crone; 2. Economy: \\"The world economy. A millennial perspective\\" (2001) plus \\"The world economy: Historical Statistics\\" (2003) by Angus Maddison (a combined edition of these two volumes is to appear on December 2007); 3. Government: \\"The History of Government\\" by S.E. Finer; 4 Ideas: \\"Ideas, a History from Fire to Freud\\", by Peter Watson; 5. Religion: \\"The Phenomenon of Religion: A Thematic Approach\\" by Moojan Momen; and 6. War: \\"War in Human Civilization\\" by Azar Gat.	2005-07-03

The authors explain that for more than two centuries, in America, the religious denominations with better scores in rates of growth were those which were organized sect-like, i.e., maintained distance with the world by imposing heavy demands upon his flock (but also granting them great rewards). On the other side, those which tried and compromised, in order to relieve tensions and differences with their society (i.e., those church-like) have been steadily declining. Difference pays, assimilation and ecumenism leads to bankruptcy.     Why? Read the book and you will find out, and although perhaps you will be somewhat shocked to see religion explained by often using economic terminology, do not worry, the book is not irreverent. Besides, it is not a difficult read (only 300 pages) though it is not a light read either (content: 5 starts; pleasure: 4 to 3).    P.S. For more information, I would also suggest reading the reviews of the first edition of this work  (\\"The Churching of America, 1776-1990\\").	2005-06-18

It is difficult nowadays to get an objective, nuanced opinion on Islam, neither flattering nor biased against it. If I were to recommend a way to try and achieve that, I would suggest reading several good books on the matter, including this among them, for in my opinion it is quite complete and fairly assessed.       This work aims to answer the following question: Which is the meaning of jihad? Holy war or spiritual striving to improve oneself?     Pursuant to the author, during the first several centuries of Islam the interpretation of jihad was unabashedly aggressive and expansive, and the conquest achieved by Islam in the VII and VIII centuries C.A. have been seen by Muslims as one of the incontrovertible proofs of Islam, so that nowadays they are unwilling to confront the fact that such conquest were basically as unjustified as European colonial conquests. The so-called \\"greater jihad\\" (i.e., the one with an ascetic and pacific meaning) seems a patently apologetic device not well attested in the hadith literature, which was adduced in order to overcome a resistance to the acceptance and legitimacy of jihad.    Cook also points out a reasonable outsider must conclude that radical Islam is indeed a legitimate expression of Islam, yet the fact that the majority of contemporary Muslims do not actively participate in militant jihad demonstrates a decisive rejection of which the radical Muslims are keenly aware. The reality is that jihad during the past two centuries has been a dismal failure, with the possible exception of the expulsion of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan. Besides, it also represents a danger to Muslims, for it is all too easy to turn it against them.    All that (and much more that I do not mention in this summary) is developed in 235 pages (footnotes included), the book being divided in the following chapters: 1. Qur'an and Conquest; 2. The \\"Greater Jihad\\" and the \\"Lesser Jihad\\"; 3 The Crystallization of Jihad Theory: Crusade and Counter-crusade,4 Jihad during the Nineteenth Century: Renewal and Resistance; 5. Radical Islam and Contemporary Jihad Theory; 6. Globalist Radical Islam and Martyrdom Operations; Afterword; Appendix: Some Translated Documents (e.g. A Communiqu from Qa'Idat Al-Jihad concerning the Testaments of the Heroes and the Legality of the Washington and New York Operations, April 24, 2002).     Nevertheless, although the content is very interesting, the book often happens to be a tough reading; therefore I have rated the book as a 4 start book (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 3 to 1).     Other books that I would recommend to read would be the following:     ASSESSMENTS OF ISLAM:     1) The best, impartial, wise: \\"Islam.

In this line, and pursuant to this work, i) although the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were a period of profound change for the noble elite of most European countries, the process of formation put new resources at their disposal, successfully employed by them for their own ends; ii) it is truth that the authority and status of noblemen was defined less in terms of autonomous power and more in terms of privileges granted by the state, and that the emphasis on physical and military prowess was toned down, and social pre-eminence was based on cultural superiority; however iii) there were decisive elements of continuity: noblemen continued to define their position in society by reference to a specific code of honour intended to set them apart from the rest of society.  <br /> <br />And throughout the period examined, the fisco-militaries exigencies of the age brought monarchy and nobility into close interdependence: the exploitation of the population to the mutual profit of rulers and ruling classes underlay much of the co-operation between them (as shown by Hillay Zmora's \\"Monarchy, Aristocracy, and the State in Europe, 1300-1800\\"). <br /> <br />The book is no very engaging, but it is not dry either. It can be savoured by the professional historian, and perhaps, by the educated layperson too.Therefore, my rate is 5 (content) and 2/3 (pleasure of reading). <br /> <br />In addition to Hillay Zmora's work, other books that I would recommend to read would be \\"Myths of Power. Norbert Elias and the Early Modern European Court \\" and \\"Vienna and Versailles : The Courts of Europe's Dynastic Rivals, 1550-1780 (New Studies in European History)\\" by Jeroen Duindam (whose books present a more accurate view of monarchy, nobility, the court and the state contrary to thatprovided by Elias's \\"The Court Society\\"); \\"State and Status: The \\"Rise of State and Aristocratic Power in Western Europe\\", by S.

Clubs ranged from political, religious, and scientific societies, artistic and literary clubs, to sporting societies, bee-keeping and bird-fancying clubs, and the author provides an account of their development, organizational structures, and membership patterns from the late sixteenth century to 1800. Clubs recruited widely from the urban affluent classes, mainly amongst men, and traditionally involved heavy drinking, feasting, singing, and gambling. Their existence is linked to new ideas about personal improvement and social reform and the rise in affluence among the gentry and professionals. Besides, Clark's comparative analysis of America serves to highlight the distinctive and common features of this institution on both sides of the Atlantic. <br /> <br />The book is a scholarly read and not always easy going; thinking of its content, I rate it 5 starts; taking into account the pleasure of reading, 3.  <br /> <br />Other books I would recommend to read are the following: \\"Consumption and the Making of Respectability, 1600-1800\\", by Woodruff D.

If I were to recommend a way to try and achieve that, I would suggest to read several good books on the matter, including this one among them: I like it because the author is extremely specific, i.e., he goes down to the detail and critizies what he does not like in muslim behaviour or thought. In that way, even if one does not agree with him on all (or part of )what he says, it is to be praised that he gives a fairly opportunity to answer back.

The outcome is that information is given in a fragmented, piecemeal fashion, without any overall explanation of evolution during this period.

In his \\"Myths of Power.

In this descriptive world, the author does not aim at providing a new model to understand European courts, but simply to compare the French court and the court of the Austrian Habsburgs, probably trying to show that there is still much work to be done before rendering any new general theory. The book is no very engaging, but it is not dry either.

In this book, Otterbein challenges the notions that there was no warfare before the Neolithic period, that early agriculturalists engaged in warfare and that military conquest led to the first, pristine, states. He identifies an evolutionary sequence that goes from no war, to internal conflict, to combat between elite warriors and to battles between massed infantry. In short, he provides us with a framework to understand the way the spread of Homo Sapiens, the origin of war, the origin of agriculture and the origin of the state are inextricably intertwined (to put it in a nutshell, PLANTS plus SOIL AND WATER plus NO WAR led to THE STATE). Besides, the book is not a difficult reading (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 4 to 3).

Therefore, I will only point out that rethinking world history has become a major concern of a significant number of historians over recent decades, and, in particular, China's role in world history is again controversial thanks to Andre Gunder Frank's Re Orient: Global Economy in the Asian Age. In this book Adshead looks at the forces which have shaped China throughout its history in order to offer an alternative interpretation of that role. He offers a survey of T'ang China, with the aim of asking questions such as how China came to occupy a central place in the world economy in pre-modern times; what forces helped shape China during this period, or how these forces may alter China's place in the Twenty-First century. More broadly, the book explores the ways in which regional changes have, throughout history, shifted the balance of the world. In order to achieve that, Adshead covers much of the political, cultural and economical history of Eurasia over the last two millenia. Besides, the book is not a difficult reading (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 3).  <br /> <br />Other books I would recommend to read are the following: \\"The History of Gov-ernment\\" by S.E.

To put it in a nutshell, his basic belief is that social competition is the driving force of cultural change, and that also applies to religions. He also emphasizes the relevance of ecstatic experiences practiced all over the world, from shamanic cultures to predatory modern cults. It is to take into account that, although he lets aside book religions, his analysis of Christianity (past and present) is lucid and (because of that, perhaps unintentionally?) depicts an image that probably many will find rather negative, even sour.    Besides, the book is not a difficult reading (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 4 to 3).    My only strong complaint about the book is its outrageous price. One hopes the publisher will issue a reasonably priced paperback edition soon, so that this timely and important work will get the wide circulation which it so clearly merits.

It summarizes very fairly the literature on this issue up to the beginning of the 80s, and concludes that Weber sketched but did not prove his thesis on the influence of protestant ethic upon the spirit of capitalism.      As far as I know, some classic books on this are &quot;Religion and the Rise of Capital-ism&quot;, by R. H. Tawney; &quot;Capitalism, Protestantism, and Catholicism&quot;, by Amintore Fanfani; or &quot;The Crisis of the 17th Century: Religion, the Reformation, and Social Change&quot; by Hugh Trevor-Roper. More recently, I would recommend to read &quot;The Reformation: A History&quot;, by Diarmaid MacCulloch, or &quot;The Spirit of Capitalism : Nationalism and Economic Growth&quot; by Liah Greenfeld.      Weber's opinion is linked one of the most controversial issues nowadays on long-term and comparative history: why Western countries have dominated the world during the last few centuries (there is no agreement on the very way the question is posed!). On this I would recommend to read &quot;The world economy.

The scope of his book is ambitious: he starts with a tremendous account of the battle of Lepanto in 1571, but then he forgoes the chronology. There are different sections on Andalucia, the Middle East, the Balkans and the Otto-man Empire.You get a bit about the romance of Moorish Spain and some exotic tales from the Crusades.    Andrew Wheatcroft is especially good on the key question of mutual perceptions. His knowledge of the Western representations of Islam in art and literature is impressive. Atrocities were mutual, and Wheatcroft wants to tell us why certain events were remembered better than others; he wishes to find out how we know what we know about the past. The tale is just that: one of difference and enmity and is clearly intended as the final word on the cultural history of the clash of civilizations. His attempt to short-circuit the 'maledicta', the words of pure hate at the heart of the relationship between Islam and the West, through a greater understanding of the history of mutual repulsion should be applauded.    All that said I had the impression that he wanted to cover too broad an issue in a new way. Certainly, he warns that his aim is not to explain why things happened that way, but how they happen, but in my opinion the very choice of some facts supposedly to be relevant implicitly asks for some kind of explanation that in this work is never openly developped.The final result is somehow confusing.    (Given that nowadays it is so difficult to get an objective, nuanced opinion on Islam, neither flattering nor biased against it, as a way to try and achieve that, I would suggest to read several good books on the matter, among them, the following: \\"The Venture of Islam\\", by Marshall G. S. Hodgson -nowadays a classic included in any bibliography on Islam-; \\"The Turks in World History\\" by Carter Vaughn Findley; \\"Muslims in the West: Redefining the Separation of Church & State\\" by Sami Awad Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh; God's Rule : Government and Islam by Patricia Crone and \\"Understanding Jihad\\", by David Cook).	2004-07-19

Mr. Laird's book is a somehow odd criticism of religion in which he reiterates once, twice, thrice...the same arguments. As a jeremiad is fairly readable but eventually becomes somehow boring. <br />He is at his best reminding us in a healthy down-to-earth commonsensical way that the Bible is full of wars approved by God (\\"if you read the Bible you could easily conclude that God likes conflict and killing\\"), God which supports male domination upon women (Ephesians 5:24; 1 Corinthians 14: 34-35; 1 Timothy 2:12) but, however, does not inform His children that soap is good to prevent diseases that He himself has created together with the rest of the world. Although he focuses on the Bible basically, from time to time he also criticises the Catholic Church, Islam, Israel and the US policy from Vietnam War times on (e.g., he bitterly asks \\"Do we seem to hold a double standard when we approve of other national leaders being charged for war crimes but demand exemption for our own leaders and military personnel?\\")<br />Mr. Laird seems to know  history (quoting several time Santayana's statement: \\"those who do no remember the past are condemned to repeat it\\") but does not care to review his final drafting for he often confuses dates: Socrates was born about 400 BCA, the Thirty-Years War began in 1616, and he seems not to realize that the Spanish Inquisition was set up in 1478. From time to time some books are mentioned or quoted (quite a good quotation is Mark Twain's sarcastic war prayer in pages 214 and 215), but no bibliography or footnotes are used.	2004-07-17

It tells the stories of the British Empire's campaigns against prostitution in India, and of the \\"comfort women\\" who served the armies in the Pacific theater of World War II. It closes with the rise of the sex-workers' rights movement and \\"sex-positive\\" feminism, and a look at risks and rewards of prostitution in the present day. Nevertheless, Ringdal's tone is so matter-of-fact that at times it seems more like a recital than a narration.<br />Ringdal illustrates prostitution's pragmatic benefits, which have dwindled only recently with the sexual revolution (with the advent of birth control and the women's movement, prostitution has lost its basic functions as a pastime and a training ground for young men; even so, women willing to have sex for money continued to fill pragmatic roles up to the present).<br />In fact, he assures us, the prostitute was regarded as nothing less than \\"a guarantor and stabilizer of morality and matrimony\\" until Victorian times; it was only during the Victorian era, with its emphasis on individual morality, that prostitution took on the cloak of sin. In his opinion, no one is entitled to sex -- paid or unpaid. But, if both parties agree that one will sell sex to the other and if both parties behave decently, then prostitution should be considered a private transaction.	2004-04-20

As the author explains, there are two different positions in historiography dealing with the European understanding of the world:     i) That stressing European exceptionalism (see e.g., David Landes's \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\"; [also -I think-, Angus Maddison, \\"Growth and Interaction in the World Economy: The Roots of Modernity \\"]);  and    ii) another current insisting that contingency and structural constraints are the key variables (see, e.g. Kenneth Pomeranz's \\"The Great Divergence\\"; [also -I think- \\"The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation\\" by John M. Hobson, forthcoming])    Liebermans book critiques the first approach, and contributes to strengthen the second by offering structured comparisons between Southeast Asia (region routinely omitted from world histories) and France, Russia, Japan and (more briefly) China and South Asia.  In that sense, Volume One of this work focuses on sustained political and cultural integration in each of the three chief sectors of continental Southeast Asia. I would point out that the author not only explains what happened in this region, but why it happened (showing with  opinions full of nuances the state of the art  on this matter). Nevertheless, although the content is very interesting, the book often happens to be a tough reading; therefore I have rated the book as a 4 start book (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 3 to 1).     Volume two (in principle to be published by the end of 2005 or early 2006) is to argue that (in terms of linear-cum-cyclic trajectories, chronology and dynamics) mainland Southeast Asia resembled much of Europe and Japan but diverged significantly from South Asia and island Southeast Asia.	2004-01-21

Chadwick ends his book by stating that \\"it had not been the expectation of historians that they would be treated as if their work was seen to have something to do with understanding the faith of the Churches\\".

It includes far more  than the history of Gregory XVI, Pius X, Leo XIII and Pius XI, it is a history of the Catholic Church in continental Europe in that period.<br />Regarding its form, the book is a pleasure for any reader  (I was delightfully surprised, for I knew his \\"Secularization of the European mind in the 19th Century\\", excellent too, but not at all engaging). I would point out, for instance, the ability of Chadwick,to vividly draw, with a stroke of his pen, plenty of characters, not only the popes (e.g., his description of Bismarck). <br />Then, I do recommend this book to anyone (urbi et orbe!).	2003-12-07

Pursuant to Hillay Zmora, until quite recently the reigning paradigm for approaching the various European nobilities has been one of a Crisis of Aristocracy but this paradigm is now itself in what looks like a terminal crisis.    Certainly, a wave of recent studies (e.g. Jonathan Dewald's European Nobility) shows that the nobles were dominant much longer than we suspected. Though small in absolute numbers, the nobility controlled most of the land and all of the politics on the Continent until well into the 19th century; facing similar probles, from one country and culture to the next nobles responded to them in very similar ways.     Throughout the period examined, we see in this book that the fisco-militaries exigencies of the age brought monarchy and nobility into close interdependence. The very oportunities, then, which the expansion of the state opened up for nobles to consolidate their hold on power, also enmeshed them in the structure and operation of the state, which was as much an arena for the regulation of conflicts inside the ruling class as an instrument of class domination (the exploitation of the population to the mutual profit of rulers and ruling classes underlay much of the co-operation between them).    In that line, Hillay Zmora, for instance, dispels the myth of the XVIIth century kings' absolutist power. In general, his work is a more accurate view of monarchy, nobility, and the state contrary to Historian Norbert Elias' classic works \\"Court Society\\" and \\"The Civilizing Process\\" which have presented a problematic view of the Early Modern court, and with it, a false view of Early Modern monarchy.

Though small in absolute numbers, the nobility controlled most of the land and all of the politics on the Continent until well into the 19th century; facing similar problems, from one country and culture to the next nobles responded to them in very similar ways. For instance, one may read \\"Myths of Power.

However, its main flaw is: how can the author tell the meaning of a myth -or a tale or whatever- for people living thousands of years ago? And why such a meaning is to be a transcendental one? Could it not just be that our ancestors enjoyed (as we do nowadays) listening to a nice story of love, death and/or conflict where beautiful women, heroic and strong men and bad enemies (whether humans or gods) are involved?     So I liked the book but I do not think that the author has proved that the meaning of myths is the one he defends. For such a purpose, a couple of more serious works I would recommend to read are: \\"When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth\\" by Elizabeth Wayland Barber and Paul T. Barber; and \\"Ecstasies: Deciphering the witches' Sabbath\\", by Carlo Ginzburg.	2003-04-11
