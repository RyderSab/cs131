Yes, definitely.  The character is much more developed, the romance is more developed, the harper bride (which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series and my sole reason for reading them) is more developed, and the plot is more developed. <br /> <br />However, it is the same old tired love story!  Is this the only kind of love Nora Roberts can describe???  Is this the only type of romance in the world?  And to you dedicated Nora Robert's fans....Don't you want to read a story where the ending is uncertain, where love may mean sacrificing a relationship, etc?  There are so many other kinds of love and romance stories out there.  And Roberts continues to use the same one...over and over and over ad nauseum.   <br /> <br />Roberts has the potential to be an awesome writer.  She just settles for being less.  It's true she's a bestseller, but are her books meaningful or important?  No.  They are just books that romance-starved women read to feel a sense of completeness in their lives. <br /> <br />The surrounding story of the Harper bride is wonderful!  The romance, on the other hand, is tired and trite.  I wish Roberts had discluded romance entirely or made it secondary to the plot.  It's just boring.  Just like we all know that in the end of Red Lily, Harper and Hayley will profess their love and hook up permanently.  No surprise.  None.  I'm only going to read it for the Harper Bride part. <br /> <br />So, overall, if you love Roberts, you'll love this.  I don't love her, so I don't love this.  Grade C- (2.5 stars)	2005-08-18

I picked up the Betsy Taylor series on a whim at my local bookstore, and I adored the first two.  The second book wasn't quite up to the par with the first, but they were completely hilarious and fun.  The third book is still rather funny, but it is disappointing. <br /> <br />In it, Betsy discovers that she has a half-sister, who happens to be the daughter of the devil all while dealing with the Book of the Dead and her evil pregnant stepmother.  Things get a little complicated with Sinclair, and she's having some trouble with her newly acquired night club Scratch.  And that's about it.  No, seriously, that's it.  There isn't any kind of driving force behind the plot; it just kind of ambles along.  I think with the other books there was a defined plot, and this one is just lacking it. <br /> <br />I have to agree with other reviewers who have called this a \\"filler\\" book between publishing dates because that is certainly how it appears.  Don't get me wrong...there are some funny scenes, but they are kind of spread out to far.  And, you get the impression while reading the book that you're really not going anywhere. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend it because it's an okay book, but I just hope the next one will be better.

Moore are hunting a sophisticated serial killer who removes women's uteruses while they are conscious.  They realize the key to catching the killer is a former victim of a similar string of killings, Dr. Catherine Cordell.    The rest of the story takes off from there. <br /> <br />I decided to break my rule of not reading crime-dramas, and give the genre a second chance.  I am not sure that second chance was warranted.  The reason I never picked up crime books before derived from my hatred of hackneyed stories.  After reading the back covers of countless crime-dramas, I realized how similar everything sounded.  So, I dismissed the genre.  Lately, I have been reading more. <br /> <br />Now, for the genre, the Surgeon is excellent.  Gerritesen creates two excellent characters in Rizzoli and Moore (both of which have a soft side, but are not always likeable).  I found Cordell, on the other hand, to be the stereotypical rape victim.  However, the writing was perfect.  A former doctor, Gerritesen brings a sense of realism to the hospital scenes and in describing much of the medical aspect of the novel.  The dialogue isn't trite, and the story moves at a pretty fast paced. But, the plot follows the exact same pattern as every other crime drama out there.  The killer mutilates victims.  The police try to solve the crime.  The killer has a final show down with the reluctant female heroine.   <br /> <br />I am giving the book a guarded recommendation.  If you're a fan of the genre, then you will love the book.  If you're a first time reader of the genre, you'll also probably love the book.  But, if you're neither an unwavering fan nor a first time reader of the genre, you will probably be a little disappointed at the formulaic nature of the novel.

The first case is pretty procedural while the second case takes up majority of the novel.  Cooper believes that the entombed skeleton was killed in the manner of an old Edgar Allan Poe story, a theory that is validated when more bodies start turning up.   <br /> <br />The plot is your standard Law & Order: SVU stuff, but it is quite a page turner.  I have to admit that I was more interested in the information on Poe than anything else.   <br /> <br />The characters are kind of your normal depictions of cops and lawyers, but coming from a law enforcement family, I have to admit that those depictions are usually not that far from the truth.  The writing was also pretty good, and the pacing was pretty fast.  I especially loved all of the information on Poe, who is my favorite author. <br /> <br />Basically, it's one of those books that's good, but not great.  You'll probably enjoy it, but you'll think to yourself once its over that it could have been better.  So, I recommend it, just don't get your hopes too high.  Grade:  B- (3.5 stars) <br />	2005-07-28
US	27609705	R35URYMNKHUGYS	0312306261	643244690	Eleven on Top	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	One Enjoyable Doughnut!	In the latest entry in the hilarious Stephanie Plum series, Stephanie has finally decided to quit her dangerous job as a bounty hunter and search for a safer job with room for career advancements.  However, she can't seem to keep a regular job, and ultimately accepts a job working for the steamy Ranger.  To add to her problems, Stephanie's sister Valerie is getting married in a week, and some psycho from her past is stalking her, leaving nasty notes and blowing up vehicles. <br /> <br />I love the Stephanie Plum series, but (at the risk of incurring the wrath of the dedicated Plum fans) I am starting to get a little disappointed with the series.  On the positive side, the book is hilarious.  There were several scenes where I was laughing out loud at the hilarity.  The quirky characters in the Plum books manage to get themselves in some pretty zany situations.  Unfortunately, I'm a little tired of the repetition.  Every Plum book follows the same formula, and it's getting a little dull.  I am also irritated that the Ranger-Morelli situation is still there into the eleventh book. It doesn't appear that Evanovich will ever force Stephanie into making some kind of decision regarding the two. <br /> <br />The Plum books remind me a lot of an hour long sitcom.  I could easily see the books working out well on television because it's basically Stephanie Plum solving different cases in a more hilarious and unconventional way than typical crime dramas follow.   <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely recommend the book.  Avid Plum fans will love it, and even the not so dedicated will be charmed by the funny dialogue.  To me, the Plum books are like the doughnuts the heroine loves so much:  they have no nutritional value, but they are certainly enjoyable going down.  Grade:  B (4 Stars) <br />	2005-07-28

Before I even really get into the meat of the review, I just want to caution anybody who did not read Retribution to do so before reading this book.  Even though Hoffman tries valiantly to update the new reader on the characters and situations from the previous book, I can imagine just how confusing it would be for a new reader.  I would even go so far as to warn you to not reading any reviews so that the whole Retribution novel isn't given away to you. <br /> <br />To continue, in this follow up, we see that CJ and Dominick are engaged, but CJ is still grappling with her old demons when a new twisted serial killer arises, known as Black Jacket.  This killer starts murdering CJ's co-conspirators from the previous novel.  Because of the gruesome way in which they are killed, the task force assigned to these murders immediately suspects a Columbian cartel connection, but CJ is not convinced.  In fact, she starts wondering if maybe there were two Cupid killers and the other one is still at large hunting down anybody who knows information that could lead to the release of Bill Bantling, the man who raped CJ and who in retribution, CJ pinned the Cupid murders on despite his innocence.   <br /> <br />Needless to say, the plot is once again filled with many twists and turns.  One of the excellent things about Hoffman's writing is its realism.  As a former attorney, she understands the legal machinations of a prosecutor and successfully incorporates them in her book to add credence to the story line.  She is also much more comfortable in her writing with this follow up, and the book flourishes because of it.  However, there is hardly any new information given about any of the characters, which I find disappointing.  We do learn a little more about Dominick, but I felt with this book, she maybe could have brought out more of each character's history.  The ending leaves room for another follow up, and I hope it is as good as this one!  Grade: A-  (4.5 stars) <br />	2005-07-20

It doesn't really matter what the reviews say about this book because everybody instictively knows whether or not they are going to read it.  I found it to be an excellent addition in the series. <br /> <br />The plot was a little slower and less action-filled than some of the other novels, but this allows for more of the background history to come into play.  We also see more character development and relationship formations than in the preceding novels.  There is a great amount of information on the younger Voldemort, which helps to explain why and how Voldemort is what he is.  There was less Quidditch, which I found to be good since you can only describe those types of scenes so often before they become dull and detract from the story.  The only thing that I disliked was the running trend that Harry thinks he is right and no one believes him.  It's quite irkesome because in every book, Rowling puts Harry in this situation.  The book also promises a climatic battle in the next novel between good and evil, which I can't wait to read. <br /> <br />Rowling also manages to keep all of her facts straight.  Sometimes with a series, authors forget what they wrote in previous novels and contradict things.  Rowling remains true, and she has a quirky way of intertwining small facts from other novels into the current one. <br /> <br />Basically, it was an excellent novel, and you'll enjoy it!

Sayre hates Destiny and all it represents because it is ruled with an iron fist by her father, Huff, and her older brother, Chris.  They own the local foundry with conditions so terrible that upper level management never wants to venture down to the floor.  Unfortunately, they also own a great deal of law enforcement officers, educators, doctors, lawyers, and anyone else who needs to be bought.   <br /> <br />Fully prepared to leave after Danny's funeral and never return, Sayre's plans are halted when sexy Beck Merchant, her father's most trusted attorney, tells her that not everybody is convinced that Danny killed himself.  Sayre decides to stay and find out the truth and help out the workers while she is there. <br /> <br />The plot is fast paced with plenty of things to keep you interested, including the labor strikes, several murders (old and new), old and painful family history, the hidden agenda of Beck, and a nasty criminal named Slap Watkins.  Despite the pace and the interest, most of the ending (which I won't reveal for you) seems a little implausible.  It's almost like Brown wanted to give you a whole new eye on Beck's character, but it just came out as if she were trying too hard to make him the Knight in Shining Armor.  Other than that, the story was good.  The characterizations were pretty good with a few rough patches here and there.  The two villains come off being a little too flat even though Brown makes a small attempt to try and \\"explain\\" them.   <br /> <br />Overall, it's a pretty good read, and I recommend it!

US	27609705	R3PC30PJFPN3W5	0441012795	142764139	Dead as a Doornail (Southern Vampire Mysteries, Book 5)	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A Great New Entry in the Sookie Stackhouse Series!!	In this new adventure, we find that Sookie's brother, Jason, is now a were-panther after being bitten during the course of the previous installment.  When a \\"shifter\\" serial sniper comes to Bon Temps, the local shifting population suspect Jason since he is brand new and was a made a shifter against his will.  To add to Sookie's plate, Sam is shot and unable to tend his bar.  So, Sookie asks the sexy Eric for help, who sends her Charles, a pirate-like vampire.  Soon, Sookie becomes the target of an assassin seemingly trying to kill her for her association with supernatural entities.  Not to mention, there's the added problem of the Were's pack leader dying. <br /> <br />As you can see, the story is interwoven from three different plots, which makes it both exciting and absorbing.  You keep reading each page waiting to find out what's going to happen!  The story is great, and for the most part resolves any lingering questions you may have about the resolution of all the subplots.  Additionally, I love the way Harris intertwines snippets from previous novels in this one.  So, if you're a first time reader of the series, you should definitely go back and read the first four books before this one.   <br /> <br />The characters are always unique and delightful, and Harris manages to keep Sookie and the other secondary characters (like Sam, Eric, and Bill) consistent throughout the novels.   <br /> <br />Now, for the reason, I am docking this one star.  As we all know, one of the most popular internal conflict sources for female writers is multiple men competing over the same woman.  Harris is no exception.  Like the Anita Blake books, Sookie has both a vampire and shifter competing for her affection, except for Sookie, it's more than doubled.  Sookie has Eric, Bill, Sam, Alcide, and Calvin Norris all competing for her.  Right now, it's not so bad, but I am starting to think that this multiple suitor problem will persist throughout the next couple of novels without any conclusion ever being made (think Anita Blake and Stephanie Plum).   <br /> <br />Other than that, it's an excellent new edition, and I highly recommend it.

When Frank Baum first wrote The Wizard of Oz as a critique on the Gilded Age, he created the evil Wicked Witch of the West, the little farm girl Dorothy's nemesis.  Maguire takes the reader back to the Wicked Witch's birth, gives her a name (Elphaba), and retells the Oz story.  Elphaba is born with green skin and razor sharp teeth to a depressed and promiscuous wife of a preacher in the wonderful Land of Oz.  From there Maguire tells of the power-hungry wizard's rise to power as he quickly establishes a dictatorship.  Despite her odd appearance, Elphaba is a very intelligent woman, concerned with the well-being of Animals (animals that have souls).  The Wizard continues to treat these creatures terribly, and Elphaba wants to put a stop to it.  The plot is so detailed that I would have to give the whole story away to summarize it!!      But some important questions are answered.  Why did Elphaba want her sister's shoes?  Why were she and her sister considered wicked?  Where did the flying monkeys come from?  Believe me there are many more.     Character-wise, Elphaba is excellent.  She's a heroine, no doubt, but she is certainly far from perfect.  The other characters in the book are also unique and well-drawn.  My only complaint is Glinda.  I have also read Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, and she reminds me greatly of Cinderella.  Spoiled, snobby, yet somehow endearing at times.  It's like the same character with only small variable shades of difference.  It seems the Maguire can only think to recreate the \\"good\\" people as being this type of character.  Other than that, the characterization is excellent.    My second complain is with pacing.  While the story is wonderful, it can be extremely slow moving!  There were times when I was ready to put the book down, never to be picked up again because I was so bored.  To put it in perspective, in the hardback version, by page 60, you have just gotten to Elphaba's first word.  The story is great, but I just feel like the book could have been shortened by maybe 40 or 50 pages and the pacing would have benefited greatly.    But, despite its flaws, the book is GREAT!  The story alone is worth the read because it so magical, imaginative, and interesting that you'll be sure to enjoy it!  So, I recommend it with a caution.  If you can trudge through the slow parts, the read is definitely worth it!  Also, one more warning!  Maguire takes a lot of liberties with the traditional Dorothy and Wicked Witch of the West Story.  Basically, he rewrites it, so if you don't want to see that story compromised than skip the book.  But remember the cliche \\"history is written by the winner,\\" so I prefer to think of this as the loser's retelling of the story.  Grade:  B+	2005-07-09

Unfortunately, the delivery does not go down as planned, and Jace is almost killed.  When he returns to confront Lenny, he finds that Lenny has been murdered.  Believing himself a suspect, Jace tries to stay one step ahead of the cops and killers.  Throw into the mix Kev Parker, a disgraced LAPD detective who doubts Jace's guilt, and you have yourself one heck of a thriller.  The plot is very fast, filled with important details, useful subplots, and red herrings.  All of the little subplots come together nicely, not all of which contribute to the final ending.  James Patterson could take a note from this. <br /> <br />The characters are excellent.  Each one has his/her own unique flavor to them, much the same way people do in real life.  Even though you may not agree with all of Jace's actions or logic, you can still understand how he came to them and respect him as a character.  Even secondary characters like Parker's rude new partner, Ruiz, are interesting.   <br /> <br />So, if I like this book so much, why am I giving it only 3.5 stars?  Two reasons.  First, Jace has a younger brother Tyler that he have been protecting and raising in secret since his mother died (thus his fear of policy stems from fear of child services).  Tyler is a genius with a 168 IQ.  Hoag tells you he has a 168 IQ no fewer than twenty times.  Tyler tells everybody he meets that he's smarter than them because he has a 168 IQ.  It gets ridiculously redundant.  I also think it's a cop out.  A lot of authors don't take on the challenge of writing a believable normal child.  They give the child a high IQ or something else to make it easier for them to write as a child.  Secondly, the very ending... (I don't want to give away anything here) falls right into a clich.  I am not talking about the big \\"twist,\\" which is totally awesome.  I'm talking about the fallout of the twist.  Let's just say...the bad person gets what they deserve even if that isn't realistic.  Combined, the novel lost 1.5 stars. <br /> <br />Do I recommend the book though?  Absolutely.  It was a great book.  I just didn't like the two above aspects, and I may just be a little harsh.  But, definitely read it.  You'll probably enjoy it!  Grade: B <br />	2005-07-03

I went to the beach for vacation, and I picked up several novels by authors I had never tried previously.  For Jonathon Kellerman, I choose Twisted, and if his other books are like this one, I'll be a new avid fan!  This was a great, fast-paced book that is very enjoyable.  Other reviewers have stated this, but I figured I would just reiterate it: there is detailed violence.  So, it's not a book for squeamish fans.   <br /> <br />Anyway, Petra Conner is a police detective who is working on her latest case, which is a drive-by shooting of several teenagers at the close of a concert.  The case is proving hard to break, and she is having difficulty locating a witness.  Moreover, she is dealing with her complicated relationship with her boyfriend Eric, who is jetting to different countries doing investigative work for the government.  As if she doesn't have enough on her plate, Isaac Gomez, a super genius working on his PhD in biostatistics, comes across a potential serial killer who kills his victims on the same day every year.  Petra is skeptical at first, but Isaac convinces her that his theory is meritorious.  From there, the plot just takes off.  It's got plenty of twists and turns for both cases to keep you interested. <br /> <br />The characters are well-developed.  Petra was very realistic and well-rounded.  Isaac was a true gem.  Usually, when an author has a really smart character that the reader is suppose to like, they botch it by making the character too arrogant or superior.  But, Isaac is very humble and socially awkward.  The only character who didn't have that much development was Eric, Petra's boyfriend, but he wasn't a major character in this book, so it can be overlooked.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great thriller with a good mystery and enjoyable characters.  I highly recommend!  Grade:  A (5 Stars). <br />	2005-06-30

I had seen it advertised before, but I was never really interested enough to pick it up.  But, I am glad I did.  This was a great, meaningful novel filled with romance, forgiveness, courage, and finding out who we really are.   <br /> <br />Julia is a 40 year old mother, daughter, and wife.  That's it.  She has defined herself for so long in terms of other people that she really doesn't even know what she wants or who she is.  All of that changes when she is on a ferry to Big Sawyer in Maine to visit her Aunt Zo.  The ferry is hit by a boat, and she and two others survive the crash while nine others die.  The story focuses on Julia coming to grips with surviving the accident and discovering her identity.  It also has a little bit of mystery about the boat crash to keep the plot going.  Julia also starts to fall in love with Noah, the man who helped save her from the ferry crash.  Noah also has to come to grips with certain aspects of his own life. <br /> <br />It's an absorbing book.  You get caught up in the characters and their lives, and they are all truly magnificently drawn.  The plot can be slow, but you really enjoy it because Delinsky is just taking her time creating multi-faceted characters.  I think the book was a little long, and probably could have stood to loose 30 pages or so, but other than that it was a really great book that I recommend.  It has some power messages.  It points out the difference between living and being alive.  Very good!  Grade:  A- (4.5 Stars) <br />	2005-06-30

What Eddie doesn't know is that he is going to die that day trying to save a young girl from an amusement park ride accident.   <br /> <br />When Eddie dies, he is transplanted to heaven where he learns that he will meet 5 people who explain certain life lessons to help Eddie forgive himself, understand his life, and accept the choices he made.  However, for the most part, these are not your \\"typical\\" kind of people like a mother, father, spouse, etc.  They are people you may have met in passing, or perhaps were never formally introduced to her; people that unknowingly touched your life. <br /> <br />The premise for this novel is brilliant, which is why it originally interested me.  The main character Eddie is a multifaceted character, and the supporting characters add a certain richness to the novel.  Essentially, the best part of this book is the plot.  Albom skillfully weaves stories together to help demonstrate these life lessons to Eddie.  An event that may seem insignificant to you may hold a deeper meaning for another person.   <br /> <br />My only real complaints with the novel are style and pacing.  The writing style can be very simplistic almost to the point of being juvenile.  But, that's mainly just a minor annoyance.  I think the pacing could have been improved.  The novel is very short.  It's 200 pages (or at least my copy is), but it's a smaller sized book and there is a lot of formatting involved to lengthen it.  I think that the stories could have been more developed, especially because Albom has such skill with interlacing common events.  Nevertheless, at the same time, I got a little bored with the book sometimes.  It seemed like certain descriptions and scenes were thrown more into lengthen the book (like the formatting).  Presently, I think the story would have functioned better as a novelette unless Albom supplemented more relevant and interesting scenes to the book. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a very heartwarming, yet heart-wrenching story with an interesting premise.  It's certainly worth reading, and I'm sure it will give you a little perspective for your own lives.  Grade:  B+ <br />	2005-06-23

After reading the first Rachel Morgan adventure, I was eager to pick up the next book, and I was not disappointed.  This book far exceeds the first book.  In it, Morgan is contracted to work as a consultant to the FIB in a series of gruesome witch murders, giving the serial killer the moniker \\"witch hunter.\\"  Along the way, Morgan taps into her own potential as a witch and discovers a few things about her past that she wishes she hadn't known.  I don't want to reveal too much about the plot because it's fast-paced and provides many twists and turns (not just involving the murder mystery).   <br /> <br />The plot itself is far more developed and \\"tighter\\" than the first novel.  It's very exciting and well-written.  I also think Harrison is more comfortable in her writing with this novel because many of the problems from the first novel are non-existent like poor pacing, loose ends, and lack of clarity surrounding the magical world.  Morgan also becomes more complex as does Ivy (a sexy living vampire who resides with Morgan), Trent (a good-looking bio-drug and brimstone runner), and Nick (Morgan's magically inclined human boyfriend).   <br /> <br />BUT (and it's a big but), if you have not read the previous installment Dead Witch Walking, I do not recommend reading this book first.  While Harrison strives to update readers who haven't read the first book throughout this novel, it's still better to read them in order.

Honeymoon is an excellent example of this. I was originally interested in reading the book after I saw an advertisement for it in one of the monthly newsletters I receive from my book club. It seemed like it would be very interesting and since it had won the 2005 Thriller of the Year Award, I figured that it would be worth my money. Well, I was wrong. I am not saying that Honeymoon is a \\"bad\\" book, but it just wasn't that good. Most of its problem had to do with the plot.  <br /> <br />Nora Sinclair is a beautiful, but deadly woman, and John O'Hara is a pursuing officer. It had the right setup to be like a \\"basic instinct\\" kind of thing, but it slips a little. Basically, Nora marries men and then kills them for their money, and O'Hara is there to (a) determine if she is innocent or not and (b) to arrest her if she is guilty.  There were several subplots involving Nora's mother and one of O'Hara's other cases, which serve no function other than to neatly tie up the ending.  Each of these subplots could have mined for its potential plot value, but instead they really just make the ending more plausible.  And the ending itself is terribly written and very sloppy. <br /> <br />Moreover, there were several plot holes, which I find most irritating because I like to feel a sense of completion upon finishing a book. The characters seemed to be somewhat inconsistent. There didn't seem to be as much of a driving motivation from Nora, as I would have expected. They set up Nora up to be a gold digger who marries handsome, rich men who are actually in love with her then kills them for their money. Money seems to be the only motivating factor for her even though these are actually decent guys who truly care about her. There are other ways of getting rich guys money that do not involve homicide. I thought that part was underdeveloped.  <br /> <br />Basically, the writing, the plot, and the character development are pedestrian and very disappointing.  I don't really recommend it. It has an interesting premise and it's a fast read, so it may be worth your time if you have nothing else to do, but overall, I'd just let this one sit on the library shelf. Grade: D+ (2.5 stars) <br />	2005-06-23
US	27609705	R1CSJCJG4T4B4Y	0060987529	558936324	Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Fresh Telling of a Stale Story	I came across this book accidentally in a bookstore, and despite the clich, I was interested in reading the book because of the cover.  I wasn't disappointed.  This is a wonderful retelling of a very hackneyed story.  The \\"Cinderella\\" story has been replayed by authors and Hollywood so many times that the story, in my opinion, hit a slump.  However, Maguire revives the tale with this witty retelling. <br /> <br />The story revolves around Clara (the beautiful \\"Cinderella\\"), Iris and Ruth (the \\"Ugly Stepsisters\\"), and Margarethe (the \\"Evil Stepmother\\").  However, these characterizations are hardly complex enough for the characters.  Clara may be beautiful but it is also a curse upon her.  She can be very stubborn, heartless, and spoiled at times, but still, the reader always feels a bit of sympathy for her.  Usually Cinderella is always portrayed as being so kind and loving, and Maguire presents a more realistic depiction of her.  Ruth and Iris are extremely well-developed and shatter most of our expectations about beauty and stupidity.  The tyrannical stepmother still embodies the clich somewhat, but her motivations are derived more from self-preservation for herself and for her daughters than for an earnest desire to cause suffering.   <br /> <br />The story is interesting and the writing is very detailed.  The descriptions of Holland during the time added credibility and realism to the story.  However, the plot seemed to drag at times, which is the reason I am giving this 4 stars in stead of 5.  For the most part, the slow plot allowed Maguire to completely develop the complexities of the characters and their relationships, but I think the book could have been shorted by like 50 pages.  It is a fast read, if at times a little dull.  I definitely recommend it, and I look forward to reading other novels by Maguire.  4 Stars. <br />	2005-06-19
US	27609705	R2HJIH7HYMDCYP	1400032717	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A different but wonderful read	The only way I can figure to describe this book is different.  I haven't ever read anything like this before, but I really enjoyed it.  Basically, the book is told through the first person perspective of an autistic 15 year old boy who is trying to find out who killed his neighbor's poodle Wellington.  Along the way, neighborhood secrets are uncovered. <br /> <br />The main character Christopher is truly unique.  Having no personal experience with autism, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the book.  What I got was a wonderfully drawn character with a very different perspective than mine.  Christopher loves math and science, and as such, the book is populated by little factoids, which, being a math geek myself, I found interesting.  However, the book also has many strong messages.  Despite his autism, Christopher is really observant about human nature and he often describes his observations in terms of math and science concepts. <br /> <br />I think the best part of the book is its realism.  The main character can be frustrating at times, so you can really sympathize with his parents, but at the same time, you can be somewhat frustrated with the parents.  I think it really shows the complex nature of living with someone with a disability and being a person with a disability, in this case autism.   <br /> <br />The writing is really excellent.  It's simplistic by nature, but it's captivating.  The story and particularly the perspective of the story are interesting.  Most of it centers around Christopher's adventures into the mundane world we take for granted, like riding on the subway.  It's truly an excellent read, and I highly recommend it.  5 stars! <br />	2005-06-17
US	27609705	R3KNKDVCQYFWLF	0452283485	1013337	Bitten (Otherworld)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	An Enjoyable Entry into the World of Werewolves	I checked out Bitten from the local library after Amazon placed it near the top of my recommendation list, and I loved it.  This debut novel creates a wonderfully vivid world of werewolves and Pack life, but at the same time crafts genuine and believable characters.<br /><br />In Bitten, Elena is a reluctant werewolf, in fact she is the only female werewolf because the werewolf gene is passed from father to son and until her, no woman had ever survived a bite.  However, Elena longs to be human and have a normal, boring existence with a family and a career.  To some extent, she achieves these goals with Phillip, her new decent boyfriend until her Pack brothers need her help.<br /><br />The plot is slower than the earlier Anita Blake books, but I think that the pacing allows Armstrong to take her time developing characters and relationships between these characters.  Elena is perhaps the most deliciously complex character I have discovered in a while.  She comes from a terrible childhood filled with foster families and abuse.  She tries to conceal the anger and rage within her through a façade of gentility and passiveness.  She is conflicted about her feelings for Clay, the werewolf who bit her while they were engaged.  Clay is also very complex and far from the perfect \\"Prince Charming\\" many writers create for their female heroine.  He has his own flaws.  However, the relationship they share was very developed and not at all simple.<br /><br />I also liked the way Armstrong handled the \\"two suitor situation.\\"  Most of the times, when a writer has two men vying for a woman's attention, one of three things happen:  one of the men dies, one of the men is found to have a terrible flaw (thus eliminating him), or the series just drags out their relationship with no conclusion.  I find all three irritating, and Armstrong breaks the mold.  She gives a definite conclusion without killing one of the characters or finding a flaw in one so as to make the choice obvious.<br /><br/>The remaining characters in the book are well-drawn, and have their own unique personalities.  Most of them play more as background characters than anything else, but they really fit into the story even for the limited parts they play.  Overall, this is an excellent novel, and thoroughly enjoyable!  I highly recommend!	2005-06-12
US	27609705	R1SHW12NUEGSBD	0505525526	992912214	Single White Vampire (Argeneau Vampires, Book 3)	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Entertaining fluff with some pitfalls	I have never tried a \\"paranormal romance\\" book before, so I decided I would give this one a try after a friend of mine recommended.  I was not disappointed, but I wasn't \\"wowed\\" either.   <br /> <br />Basically, Kate Leever is an editor with a publishing firm, and she is trying to get one of her writers, Lucern, who also happens to be a vampire, to do publicity tours and events to increase his books sales.  Lucern wants to be left alone, but Kate is very pushy about it.  Eventually, with the help of Lucern's mother, Kate manages to get Lucern to a 5 day romantic writers conference.  Hilarity and sex ensue. <br /> <br />I think the use of nanotechnology as the causation of vampirism was a fresh take on the subject.  However, whenever one tries to reinvent the genre, he/she must have a solid understanding of how they want that.  Sands does an excellent job of crafting this new idea with the exception of one aspect.  She does not address children.  Apparently vampires can have children, but what happens then?  Is there some kind of set cut-off for when the child doesn't age anymore, and doesn't that go against the whole nanotechnology idea?  I have found that children seem to be the big issue with vampires and other immortal creatures.  Most authors just take the easy route and say it's impossible.  For those that do try to grapple with this issue, it's very difficult to figure out a plausible solution. <br /> <br />The sex scenes were definitely tantalizing and there were funny scenes.  The characters were decently likeable (not that it really matters), but I kind of felt they were both being really stupid.  Anybody who has read any form of romance knows that it all follows the same \\"boy meets girl-boy loses girl-boy and girl are reunited\\" kind of plot.  I just think the \\"boy loses girl\\" part was never really that plausible.  I think it was kind of forced.   <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good read.  It's fast, and it'd be perfect for a beach or a plane ride.  3.5 Stars. <br />	2005-06-08
US	27609705	R2C8PCP6ACV707	0060572965	661385357	Dead Witch Walking	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A fast and fun paranormal mystery!	The paranormal genre, whether it is romance, mystery, or horror, has seen an influx of new writers, which carries both positive and negative consequences.  On one hand, the books and characters tend to be so similar that you have the impression of reading what is essentially the same book several times.  However, there are a few writers who manage to break through the monotony, and Kim Harrison is one of them.  With the Rachel Morgan series she combines the best characteristics from the Anita Blake books and the Stephanie Plum series (Janet Evanovich), but she still manages to keep an original and creative outlook on the genre.   <br /> <br />In Harrison's world, the discovery of DNA led the human race to focus their efforts on more microbiological research, including genetically engineered food as well as biological weapons.  Unfortunately, the humans wind up almost eradicating themselves when a lethal virus is transmitted via a tomato.  The Inderlanders (vampires, pixies, weres, etc) take advantage of this and reveal themselves since they have no fear of being destroyed by the lower number of humans. <br /> <br />Morgan is a witch who worked for the I.S. where she brought in Inderlanders for different crimes.  However, she gets fed up with her boss and always getting the `crap' assignments, so she quits.  But, nobody quits from the IS, so she is not plagued by death threats. <br /> <br />The plot is a non-stop action with Morgan desperately trying to find a way to pay off the bounty on her head.  Along the way, we are introduced to Ivy, a sexy female vampire, Jenks, a strong and funny pixie among others. <br /> <br />The characters and plot are pretty good.  Morgan is a believable character, and each character has his/her own unique characteristics.  I am giving this 4.5 stars for one reason.  Harrison needed to explain the \\"magic\\" a little better.  There were times when I was confused because I didn't understand the lingo, and I am still confused as to whether anybody who goes to college and gets a degree can be a witch.  I think she could have been clearer here, and that would have improved the cohesiveness of the text.  Excellent novel though, and I highly recommend it! <br />	2005-06-08
US	27609705	R20D2TYUU1XGN	0385507615	400682657	Blackbird House	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A wonderful haunting read	Alice Hoffman is one of my favorite authors mainly because her work has resonance.  When you read an Alice Hoffman book, you cannot help but be moved by the characters, by the situation, and even by the setting.  Blackbird House is no different. <br /> <br />The novel weaves the stories of the successive inhabitants of a house in Massachusetts with great skill.  The prose is wonderful.  While the novel does not have a story or defined plot to speak of, the reader is ensnared by the power of the house and by a genuine interest for all of the inhabitants.  Hoffman even makes references to the early generations of the house through the new tenants.   <br /> <br />Hoffman makes you believe that we leave a part of ourselves in our homes, and when we move into a house that has been lived in before, the presence of the previous owner's spirit can still be felt.  When the book concludes, the reader knows that 5, 10, maybe even 50 years from then, a new person will be living in the house.  The house and the lives of those who lived there can never truly be erased. <br /> <br />It's hard to really review this book because its best feature is practically indescribable.  It affects you.  You read the book, and you are moved by it.  Its stories haunt you, and that's why I enjoyed it so much.  It definitely is a 5 star rating. <br />	2005-06-03

However, I picked it up from the local library, not expecting much.  I was wrong. <br /> <br />This is a great book.  You can get a real picture of what is like to be raped and the devastating psychological after effects.  Chloe Larson is brutally raped and tortured while in law school.  12  years later, she is a strong prosecutor who has begun to prosecute a gory case.  During the proceedings, she realizes the man charged with the crime is her rapist from 12 years before.   <br /> <br />The book has all the elements of a great thriller.  You don't want to put the book down.  Period.  The psychological aspect is well-written, and it's a surprisingly great read especially for a first effort.  The plot has plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested. <br /> <br />I would have given this 5 stars, but the ending slipped a little.  The set up for it was there, but (without revealing anything) it seemed too hurried.  It was almost like Hoffman lost control of the wheel for a like 15 pages.  It wasn't too bad though, just a minor blemish on the book.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre and to first time readers.  However, there are some graphic descriptions which may turn some people off from the book.  Other than, it was a great, must-read book.	2005-06-03

The entire play is just Andy and Melissa reading letters they have written to each other throughout their lives, but it still packs a dramatic \\"punch\\".  Gurney loves to critisize WASP culture in his plays, but I was more involved in the love story.  Andy and Melissa are two people who want to be together, but can't.   <br /> <br />All of the letters were wonderful.  At times they were funny while others were very touching.  The end of the play is the most heartfelt, tear-inducing scene I have ever read in both drama and regular prose.  It's a short play; it'll take less than hour to read.  Just read it.  I promise you won't be disappointed.	2005-05-16

But, if you want to read a light and hilarious fluff book, go ahead and buy this one. <br /> <br />Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Taylor, dies in a terrible car crash, but somehow she manages to wake up.  It gives a whole new meaning to the expression \\"You may wake up one day and find yourself dead.\\"  Well, undead at least.  That's right!  Betsy's a vampire, but more than that she may be the Queen of the Vampires.  She finds she has to help the sexy Eric Sinclair overthrow the current vampire leader, a vampire cliche Nostro.  Needless to say, hilarity ensues. <br /> <br />This book is extremely funny, and even though Betsy is a little ditzy and vain, she's a great character and fun to read about.  The book builds off a lot of the stereotypes in movies and books, and makes fun of them.  Even Betsy seems to be caricature of the ditzy blonde heroine in horror movies.  It's a really fast and fun read, and I highly recommend it.	2005-03-14

I enjoyed the Da Vinci code, but I thought that the prose could have been improved.  Naturally, I thought this would be a great book to read.  I was wrong. <br /> <br />I may be a little biased in this review since I purchased the book under false pretenses.  This book is really two books in one.  The first book is an attempt to capitalize on the success of the Da Vinci code.  It concerns deciphering the meaning behind an ancient text, which allegedly leads to buried treasure.  The second book, which is the real center of the novel, is about the relationship four roommates have with one another.   <br /> <br />The story is told through the first person perspective of the central character.  It really concerns his experiences with his friends in college than with the ancient text.  In fact, it seems more like the text was an afterthought. <br /> <br />I found the relationship side of the text to be fairly dull especially since all of the characters were barely two dimensional.   <br /> <br />The action plot revolving around the ancient text was incredibly preposterous and quite asinine.  In fact, the whole murder aspect of the book was shabbily put together.   <br /> <br />This book may have been more enjoyable if the authors had choosen to write solely about the ancient text and improve the action sequences, or if the authors instead focused on the friendship dynamics of the four roommates.  As it is, I recommend avoiding this book.	2004-12-22

Let me say that it is not this book in particular that I am disappointed in; it's more the trend the books are following. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the first few Anita Blake novels, but the more recent ones have started spiraling in a downward direction.  My disappointment centers around Anita. <br /> <br />At the end of every novel, Anita grows more and more powerful (a pattern several others reviewers have noticed as well).  Eventually, she will be so powerful that nobody will be able to compete with her.  As a woman, it is refreshing to see an independent and strong female lead, but the stories are bordering on being ridiculous (and that's a serious comment for a fantasy series).   <br /> <br />As a result of this shift, Jean Claude and even Richard are being emasculated, and one has to wonder why either one of them care about her, which leads me to my next point. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the series, Anita was wholesome (at times even in a irritating way), and the novels are degenerating into soft core pornography.  From other reviews, I have gathered that this trend persists in the next novels.  I think that Hamilton is trying to introduce too much of the Merry Gentry series into the Anita Blake novels.  For those of you who have read the Merry Gentry series, you know that they are mostly just one sex scene tied sloppily to the next anticlimatically.   <br /> <br />I think a distinction needs to be made between Anita enjoying good sex occasionally and Anita becoming too promiscous.  I originally started reading the series for the story, but the story seems to be taking a back seat to the sex scenes.  Hopefully, Hamilton will return to the older style of the novels, and leave the sex to Merry Gentry. <br /> <br />	2004-12-22

I really enjoyed this series up until the third book. <br /> <br />I liked Phillip, and I think he was a fairly well-rounded character.  In fact, aside for the redundancy and stereotypes present in all Nora Roberts book, I found this book to be entertaining. <br /> <br />So what, you may ask, is my problem?  My problem is with Sybill.  Somewhere around page 40 in the hardback (I believe) when the reader learns (WARNING:  Mild spoiler ahead) that Sybill is Seth's aunt, my faint disinterest in Sybill turned to flat out disklike.  Sybill makes a comment to the effect that \\"although Gloria is a drug addict, Seth is her son and should be with her\\".   <br /> <br />For some one so educated, especially with regards to people, this comment puzzled me.  Either this comment was totally out of character and was a blemish on Nora Roberts part, or Nora Roberts wrote the character this way.  Far be it for me to criticize a central character wtih flaws, but I simply could not recover from this statement, particularly when similar statements and action were made later in the novel.   <br /> <br />It may seem like a petty complaint when there are so many other serious problems with the novel, but it is my opinion. <br /> <br />Hopefully, Seth's novel will improve (although I am sure he'll end up marrying some beautiful woman as all the handsome Quinn men seem to).	2004-12-22

I can't read her all the time because every book that I have read so far has had the same exact plot line copied throughout each book.  A beautiful small breasted woman meets a gorgeous man, has a hot premarital sex scene, and then marries him (and sometimes has children).  The only thing that changes is the situation during which this hackneyed \\"boy meets girl\\" story unfolds.<br /><br />Needless to say, this book follows the same premise.  I was initially interested in this book for the ghost story aspect, and I found myself wishing that the book was entirely about the ghost and not the women.<br /><br />In this particular novel, Stella is a young widow with two rambunctious little boys.  She moves back to her home town, and gets her dream job managing a nursery.  Roz, her boss, insists that Stella and her sons come stay with her.  Then, Stella meets the ruggedly handsome Logan, another employee of Roz's, and you can guess what happens.  Not to spoil it, but Logan and Stella prove that opposites attract, have a hot premarital sex scene, etc.  Well,  you get the picture.  Unfortunately, the ghost of the house (here's where the ghost story comes in) doesn't really like Stella falling in love with Logan.<br /><br />The characters are fairly well-developed, but they are the same kind of characters that are duplicated in other novels (Roz reminded me of Mia in the Three Sisters Trilogy).<br /><br />The garden talk was extremely excessive, and I frequently skimmed the lengthy discussions of plants to get back to the story.  I felt the plot was depressingly slow moving and dull.  Usually, I am absorbed by the situation the characters are in as with the Three Sisters trilogy or the Chesapeake Bay series, but I didn't even feel as though there was too much of a story.  Most of the major action takes place in the first and last chapters.  In the first chapter, Stella is widowed, and the last has a sort of \\"show down\\" with the ghost.  But, everything in the middle was just kind of \\"blah.\\"<br /><br />Overall, I find Roberts a substandard writer who caters to an antiquated idea that a woman's (although I suppose it could apply to men as well) life is only fufilled if she finds a man (or woman in the case of a man).  Nevertheless, I do enjoy a good romance story every now and then (which Roberts usually delivers), but this is not it.<br /><br />Even for avid fans of Nora Roberts, this is below her usual standards.  I recommend purchasing it in paperback if you must have it, or borrowing it from your local library.everything in the middle was just kind of \\"blah.\\"    Overall, I find Roberts a substandard writer who caters to an antiquated idea that a woman's (although I suppose it could apply to men as well) life is only fufilled if she finds a man (or woman in the case of a man).

While the novel presents a very new and interesting approach to the Autharian legend, it is limited by two very important flaws:  character development and writing style.<br />I think Borchardt's ideas are wonderful.  It is refreshing to see such a positive and strong female lead character.  Not to mention, I love the spin she puts on the legends by making Merlin and Igrane evil characters.<br />However, my first problem, which is rather small, regards Guinevere.  I like her character, but I just can not get passed one of her actions.  When she meets Arthur, she is instantly in love with him although he does not exactly treat her with any kind of respect.  Guinevere is such an intelligent and mature character (or at least that is how she is portrayed), and for her to swoon over Arthur seems unbelievable to me.  <br />However, my second criticism of the novel concerns a far worse problem.  At certain times, I felt incredibly confused and disoriented while reading Borchardt's novel.  She has a tendency to change worlds and times so quickly that the reader will spend several pages of rereading and skimming to ascertain what has just occured.  She does not transition well when an some important action occurs, leaving the reader to question whether or not he/she read thorougly.  <br />Overall, it is not a bad book, and I recommend it if for no other reason because of the fresh stance she takes on Guinevere.  However, be forewarned, the text gets very confusing and chances are you will miss or won't understand some of what takes place.  I know I didn't.	2004-01-29
