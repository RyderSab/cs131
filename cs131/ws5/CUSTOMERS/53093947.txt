It's great to have tested, proven strength training routines that don't depend on expensive equipment or trips to the gym. Pavel is a great antidote to the steroid pumped ego-maniacs who pose as strength training experts.	2004-05-19

Eugene Schwartz's book has always been high on my personal list.<br />This is an advanced, but beginner-friendly book.  Can you get it from the library for free? Yes,  if you're lucky and your library has a copy of the original edition, but if you're a serious marketer - or you want to be - this is a book you'll probably want to own and chew on for many, many years to come.<br />Here's the deal:<br />There are many excellent 'how to write ad copy' books that will teach you formulas for writing ads. They're useful and the more of them you read and apply, the better your copy will be.<br />But there are very, very few books - you can count them on the fingers of one hand - that can teach you how to think like a top copywriter.  This book is one of them.<br />By the way, what does 'top copyriter' mean? Imagine selling over 1,000,000 copies of a hard cover book with nothing more than a sales letter.  Gene did that regularly.<br />Whatever way you get a copy, if you want to become a top writer, this timless book is a must.	2004-04-15

Unlike so many 'success' authors, Scheinfeld has made the principles in his book work, not by selling 'get rich quick' or 'believe and get rich' schemes, but in the real business world.<br />The other ten elements? They're the principles 'success gurus' spout that not only don't work, but can also lead you into a world of trouble.<br />Scheinfeld's advice on widely disseminated success principles<br />that DON'T work but many people believe is easily worth many times the cost of the book.	2004-01-11

This is a well written, well researched popular introduction to an important therapeutic methodology.<br />The methodology was developed by a distinguished Russian physician, an MD, and is fully supported both by basic physiology and numerous clinical trials. It is a widely accepted therapy in many countries including Russia, the UK and Australia and at least one US hospital has fully integrated it into its respiratory the r apy department. To say that the therapy is &quot;out there&quot; is a reflection of the ignorance of the reviewer, not reality.<br />As for the supposed &quot;dangers&quot; of mouth taping shut to train nose breathing, this is not an uncommon practice and in fact a special a dh esive is marketed by 3M for this purpose (3M micropore mouth tape.)

I found this book to be inspiring and eye opening about an important subject that to date has rated a zero on the scale of public awareness.<br />The true \\"native New Yorkers\\" were in fact Native Americans. They made overwhelmingly important contributions to the creation of what we call the United States of America that have been completely edited out of the history books. (I guess the scholars took off that day.) The New York metro area and Hudson Valley are *saturated* with native history and Pritchard does a great job of bringing this history back to life. I defy anyone to read \\"Native New Yorkers\\" and not have his view of the portion of the earth called New York changed permanently. Is the scholarship in this first major effort to expose a long buried history flawless? I don't know. I'm sure if there are corrections to made, as there are in every book, they will appear in future editions. I encourage those who found flaws with the book to take advantage of the consciousness raising this book will accomplish and bring their own knowledge about this important subject to the public.	2002-08-28

The source of our present day media sewer can all be traced back to Hearst's turn-of-the-century and-beyond media 'experiments.'

But hey, no one's perfect. \\"Liar's Poker\\" about the Wall Street of the 1980s and is one of THE finest books about the realities of that perenially shaddy business. Anyone who read it, and took its message to heart, would have seen the 'dot bomb' coming from a mile away. Too bad publishers weren't buying THAT story. Lewis is a thoroughly entertaining writer. \\"Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street\\" is a newly minted subtitle of which I thoroughly disapprove. There has been no 'rising' since 1980. It's been fraud piled upon fraud as Michael knows better than most. I worked on \\"The Street\\" in the 1980s and his account is 100% accurate - which should have scared the heck out of any investor with a brain.	2002-08-22

If you need to know the 'nuts and bolts' of how to DO Internet publicity today, you won't find a more useful, up-to-date guide anywhere. In fact, this book is a standard for all 'how to' books.

From it, I learned that I could control my thoughts and substitute encouraging, strengthening, creativity-enhancing thinking habits (&quot;programming&quot;) for the less than optimal habits I'd picked up from family, friends, school, work, society etc. HOW you think makes ALL the difference and there has never been a book that clarifies the mechanisms of productive thinking better than Psycho-Cybernetics. This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of. I owe it all to my outlook and this book was where I began to make the connection between outlook and happiness and results in life. Essential reading.	2002-02-14

It's a little known fact that the federal government, when it is not funding terrorists like Osama bin Laden, uses millions of tax payer dollars each year to surveil, harass, and disrupt legitimate First Ammendment activities of groups it disapproves of here in the United States. Glick documents these activities (often referred to as COINTELPRO for the FBI program of the same name) and gives human rights, peace, civil rights and environmental groups (the most frequent targets) an undertanding of how these anti-democratic operations work and how to indentify and counteract them. As one of the founding fathers said: &quot;The price of Liberty is eternal vigilance&quot; and this is an important work in that grand tradition.	2002-01-08

This is an  entertaining and well written overview of the field of music therapy and would benefit any person interested in expanding human potential. I've been involved in music for twenty-four years including record and concert production and hosting a daily radio program. I've had the opportunity to come in direct contact with some of the world's greatest musicians and I feel certain most of them would find this book fascinating. I certainly did.

If you live in a state where the law protects its citizens from law enforcement abuses (speed traps, sloppy policework, outright lying) and judges handle motor vehicles cases fairly, this book could be very helpful. It's reasonably priced and packed with truly useful information. There's good stuff about how to avoid speeding tickets too. Unfortunately, there are many states where you can't even subpoena records in order to prepare your case. New York is one of them. How can you defend yourself without such a basic right? Answer: You can't. Most judges, especially at the level of traffic court, are hacks who couldn't care less about justice. Your community may be an exception to this disgraceful state of affairs. The best way to find out is to go to court BEFORE your court date and see how the cases are heard. Since crooked cops and judges are used to making \\"deals,\\" you can hire another crook, an attorney, to bargain down your charge to something that will have less of an impact on your driving record and insurance. It's all very legal. My advice: Drive carefully, expect to be shaken down by the crooks, I mean cops, from time to time, and find out if, like California and Nevada, your state's laws treat these kinds of offenses fairly. If so - and you're willing to really work at it - take a shot at defending yourself if nothing more than for the experience of acting like a citizen for a free country. I think the book is outstanding, but it's no magic pill for this very common form of police and government harassment....	2001-08-21

The beautiful city by the bay, the world's favorite tourist  destination, the place everyone loves to visit has also served as the home  base for one of the most industrious band of white collar thieves and  cutthroats the world has ever known. Rarely, have so few people created so  much devastation in such a short period of time.<br />If this is news to you,  then the mythologizers have done their job very well.<br />The ecological  devastation of California and other parts of the West and Pacific basin -  the horrific destruction caused by reckless mining, the deforestation on a  scale almost impossible to conceive, the ruination of millions of acres of  fertile soil - a preponderance of these disasters were the outcomes of San  Francisco-based enterprises.<br />San Francisco's elite also played a crucial  role in involving the US in destructive wars overseas starting with the  Spanish-American war through to Vietnam and Central America. San  Francisco's leadership in developing both the Bomb and the rationale for  using against Japan is also covered in detail.<br />The story isn't pleasant,  but it's real and it's essential reading for anyone who is trying to make  sense of the last 100 years.

I feel someone should respond to the profoundly inaccurate characterzations  of this book by &quot;danael@earthlink.net from California&quot; and to a  lesser degree &quot;A reader from Oregon.&quot; Contrary to claims by  Danael, NOWHERE in the book do  the authors &quot;attempt to usurp the  origin of quilting patterns and assign them to another group.&quot; In  fact, early on they state very clearly that the tradition of quilting they  describe is &quot;a cultural hybrid, mixing African encoding traditions  with American quilt patterning conventions...&quot; Another blatant  inaccuracy is the statement that no original African-American quilts appear  in the book. This is simply not true. The book contains color reproductions  of African, traditional African-American, and contemporary African-American  quilts, including a quilt belonging to Frederick Douglass. As for the  Oregon reader's statement that &quot;title is a misnomer as to total  content&quot; this is also not factual. The book's title &quot;Hidden in  Plain View: A Secret Story of Quilts and the Undeground Railroad&quot; is a  very precise and complete description of the book's contents. Another  statment by the same reviewer is so inaccurate as to be bizarre: &quot;The  amount of information contained about quilts and patterns and their  meanings could be explained in a 1-2 page article.&quot; The origins and  possible meanings of over ten patterns are discussed, each pattern  requiring several pages worth of exposition. I hope that no one is  discouraged from reading this remarkable book by reviews that fail the test  of basic accuracy. This book is worthy of attention and study.	1999-02-04
