If I can't sell it, it will make some expensive material for bbq or backwoods. I'll share what I think is of priceless value: learn to \\"pray-read\\" bible passages, so simple anybody can do it. Find a nice quiet spot as you would for meditation, then repeat the words; for example, \\"I am.. I AM the Bread.. THE Bread.. Bread of Life.. OF Life..

I wasn't happy with the software design or signals, but when the data download software stopped working only months after I bought the product making it useless, they told me they didn't know how to fix it? and I would have to \\"upgrade\\" for more money, eventually they kept all the product cost without resolving the problems and ignored all my correspondence. I am a Tradestation Easy Language expert, I have been trading and investing now for over ten years including consulting with online sites, and I know for myself how important it is from the very start to cut losses, but just as importantly to cut costs, because reality check, I never found any \\"system\\" in my own exhaustive testing that works consistently well. So if I could do it all over, as Trader Vic Sperandeo points out, capital preservation is bottomline crucial for success, I would buy absolutely nothing except a few good inexpensive books with all of the core technicals and fundamentals thoroughly covered. A somewhat useful free book is Charlie Wright's \\"Trading as a Business\\" from Omega Research, customer support has always been acceptable to me, and my brother likes his Supercharts software, a relatively inexpensive way to test ideas and find out there is no \\"system.\\" This \\"Seven Chart Patterns..\\" book was mailed to us free of charge by the way and I think it is worth reading for free, probably by contacting Nirvana Systems, but I will personally never do business with them again. \\"Piranha\\" Systems demonstrated to me through their business character and my bad experience just how much they support, value, and respect me the customer.	2002-04-25

I had an english teacher who would ask something like this, &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot; If you confirmed with a yes, it was either &quot;plus ten points&quot; to your relieve or &quot;minus five&quot; to your disappointment. Sometimes you took a real chance, &quot;minus two-hundred&quot;. I learned some things from this book that I think are of value, things that I also feel have helped me in a general way through the days. I don't want to give them away, because there are plenty of gems he shares throughout the book, but I recently found out that Jack is reportedly jacking over his second wife by jacking off with jill, and he dismisses this with the press by saying it's his personal life, none of your business, which has to take it beyond the &quot;reportedly&quot; label, which makes it just that much more inexcusable coming from a very visible celebrity. That's just the way it is, nothing is personal, nothing, once you become a celebrity. Every celebrity knows this common sense reality. That's the price you pay, and you had to know that and decided on that, at some point. Getting people to face reality is one of life's great challenges. Stop kidding yourself, Jack, and face reality. Nevertheless the overall things that Jack shares about reality, education, and integrity, at least so he shares in his writings, are worth reading about definitely, are worth feeling and thinking about. I realize that we are all just human with our mistakes and errors, we all have the fragments in our character, and I have to respect that Jack does admit some mistakes he made, including his workaholic tendencies and I take that to mean his some-what habitual neglect toward his family and first wife. And on the other hand, what I think he means, having the standard of high integrity in business dealings, as opposed to the type of bad judgement and character we see through the Enron scandal. But I was a little bothered by Jack's apparent lack of balance in trying to give more equal weight to family and business, and I am very bothered now that a man who speaks so much about integrity would reportedly do this type of thing to his present wife. Up to this point, I felt that the book was something I would like to keep in a private library collection. I have decided to dust off my shelf and sell this book for about half-price, because I generally feel that the man's words throughout the book and his present actions in reality just don't add up somehow. I'm not sure if this is what he wants us to believe, that he spoke from the gut and that he's a man of high standards; just that the behavior of cheating on one's wife is a form of stealing, of ultimate betrayal, of the worst sort. I don't want whatever is going on here on my shelf, however I do suggest that you buy the book, excellent easy reading, and read it as an autobiography of a successful businessman in his own right, but definitely not a keeper. There is something to learn at every turn, something from everybody whether good or bad. After reading the book, place it up for sale as I have done.	2002-03-16

What can I say? The man is a legend, transforming General Electric from a great American company into a great global power. I was highlighting a lot of Jack's thoughts, concepts, and feelings; such sharings as the objective to have only the number one or number two businesses, to retain only the very best employees to get the company moving toward that objective, and to have a global perspective. Jack's mom instilled in him some of the same encouragement he imparts to employees to get them to face reality and move outside the stranglehold of bureacracy, &quot;If you don't study,&quot; she often warned, &quot;you'll be nothing, Absolutely nothing. There are no shortcuts. Don't kid yourself!&quot; Jack also had his humbling experiences; such as, the time a Kidder peabody trader had created a three hundred million dollar crisis deficit in the financial records.	2002-01-30

The subject content is simple and straightforward enough: Let go of self-defeat and release your inner strength. What really annoys me to no end about this book, and why the book wasn't very helpful at all, is primarily his obnoxious writing style. He writes like this throughout the book: to NOT be aware of what you DON'T want is in truth what you CAN'T change. And you're shaking your head, what did he just say there? So, you spend more time than you should translating these ridiculous double-negative inverted statements into something simple, as they should be, that makes sense. I am currently re-reading the book to try and understand what he's really saying. I found Anthony Robbins book, 'Unlimited Power' to be clearly written without all the verbal game-playing, and much more helpful in content.	2001-07-17

It is an old world, almost archaic, style of writing that was difficult for me to read, and to understand the underlying stories. At least one of Ambrose Bierce's classic writings, &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek&quot;, was produced into a truly amazing Twilight Zone episode.

A professional trader's website emphasizes that risk, the reality, is often soft-peddled to the public. The Perfect Storm is what I consider as the perfect &quot;market training&quot; movie to emphasize just how risky the market can be, and how important careful planning and respect for risk can be. Jaws is a great example of outright bad planning. As a Market Wizard said, I 'm not surprised by anything the market can do, any sudden new parameter, low or high. This comprehensive book is a great keeper reference, and I think rightfully emphasizing sound fundamentals of a financially sound company, over charting, merely what fickle market price says, and other technicals.	2001-06-11

Mostly, the book is well organized: on one page with text explanations, including HTML code hints mostly, and the other side with the example website. Although, if I have one slight argument about books today in general, it's that the writing style should be more &quot;highlight arranged&quot;; To borrow from the book's cover: readers want to quickly access the pertinent information they need. Time-wise, this book would be cost-effective with half the words at the same price, but more useful if organized as an indexed reference; for example, similar to the excellent book &quot;A Writer's Reference&quot;, by Diana Hacker. It's not an easy book to master on first read; it covers a lot of ground, so I'll have to re-read. I wouldn't skip this book by any means, but I agree with some reviewers: to get more than just one expert's perspective, different perspectives if possible; For example, the O'Reilly book &quot;Web Design In A Nutshell.&quot;	2001-06-01

This is a very important book for all concerned, and is often quoted by Steve McConnell in his equally important &quot;Code Complete&quot; and &quot;Rapid Development.&quot; Grady Booch refers quite often to real world object-oriented application models, to thinking along that line for solving real-world problems, and uses plenty of code examples from several different OOP languages including Smalltalk and C++. The goals of the book as outlined in the preface are to provide a sound understanding of the fundamental concepts of the object model, to facilitate the mastery of the notation and process of object-oriented analysis and design, and to teach the realistic application of object oriented development within a variety of problem domains. Last time I looked, this book is a listed selection for ICCP CCP certification, the mother of all certifications, and the choice of U.S. Armed Forces and Government Agencies.

This is an excellent complement to Modern Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, by Andrew Althouse et al, or for those on the more technical side of computer applications. Even software people can and should learn something from this book. Electronics can provide a better understanding of what's actually going on inside the computer when a C++ or COBOL programmer creates a variable register, rather than the traditional approach of showing boxes on paper with hex numbers in them.

I've seen his frequent quest lectures on television and radio business channels and in business section editorials.<br />I think this book makes a great complement to professional trader Larry Connor's &quot;Advanced Trading Strategies.&quot; My perspective is that &quot;Mastering Elliott Wave&quot; contains everything one needs at all levels to master Elliott Wave, with clearly drawn pictures, complete computations, and exhaustive detail. <br />Where &quot;Mastering Elliott Wave&quot; provides the detailed &quot;language&quot; specification, Larry provides the more specific Elliott Wave &quot;code&quot; applications to trade the market. It seems that each book complements the other synergistically. Mastering Elliott Wave provides you with all of the tools, where Larry's book gets you to think more practically about logic and system design variations using the EW tools. <br />Many strict Elliott Wave tacticians hand draw their charts to get a better feel for market movement and direction.

I would never trust Robert's character or wisdom; his stuff tests positive for maybe ten percent, forty percent of the time, maybe; But they can all say, hey it works.<br />I deciphered and tested a lot of clever &quot;not a system&quot; hype, which went right back before thirty day. William's stuff seems the most disjointed, tougher to integrate test. He has some unique methodology and it seems to  work for him successfully, but his hotline calls on about a half dozen trades scared me clean away. I'm going to integrate test him soon though, somehow, maybe combining COT or AccDis with B and C and D or E, if somebody hasn't. <br />I wasted $2500 on Trade&quot;Hype&quot;station and another $500 on Omni&quot;Clutz&quot;Trader starting out.

This is not an easy certification to master or achieve, so pay attention to the detail in this book. The book terminology is relevant to the industry today, and the repetitive approach is geared toward an important cognitive technique: that you are more likely to remember something if you hear it or see it more than once. It's a wonder why somebody would bother with education, who is calling such important material 'garbage' or 'hi-tech dribble.' These people should re-examine why they are in school, why they are taking this class, and why they are reading this book? And it shouldn't be because mom or dad or anybody else wants you to. This book is designed to be interactive and therefore layered with repetition to enhance learning. It should be to LEARN as much information and technique as possible before getting a real-world job, where these skills make the difference.

It was intolerable reading. Clists are an important aspect, at least an overview, of mainframe programming; it would be far better to search the internet for an online overview. Blabbermouth's entire book reads like this disaster, &quot;[It might be noticed that in changing] the positional parameters to keyword parameters we also changed the variable names. [We would still like to use meaningful names], but the CLIST user will no longer see the variable name in a prompt for information. The user will now have to type in the variable name to equate it to a particular value. [It would probably be wise to reach a compromise, then, between variable names that are easily understood and those that will not require an excessive amount of typing]. The language, in fact, only supports keyword variable names up to thirty-one characters.&quot; Boring!

I found the true-false questions at the end of each chapter, with supporting answers at the end of the book, most helpful. For example, True or false: COBOL data-names may not contain blanks? Compare this to Kurt Bosler's dreadfully written CLIST Programming, and you will see that Belcher's handbook reads like a novel &quot;with the lights on.&quot;	2001-04-24

For example, &quot;...when we risk the first step toward our dreams, the next step will become clear, then the next, and the next- as if light begins to illumine our way ~ From Captain Picard: A Matter of Time: 45350.&quot; This is a positive step in the right direction and affirms some of the readings I have gained from such books including &quot;The Secret of Letting Go&quot; by Guy Finley and some of the works of Anthony Robbins and Dennis Waitley.	2001-04-11

This book is so well written, inspirational, motivational, and sets forth principles with many clear examples. I have marked up my paperback version with notes and highlights; each page is concentrated with so much information designed to educate and empower the reader. It includes the famous persistence story of Colonel Sanders, who started off with a chicken recipe and a big dream. I get the sense from Anthony Robbins' writing that this is a guy who transcends mere materialism to genuinely give and share what he sees and experiences- As Gary Zukav would say, a &quot;multisensory&quot; personality, rather than five-sensory, and as Abraham Maslow would say, a &quot;self-actualized&quot; personality. In light of this book, any criticisms would appear as self doubts; for it really is UP TO ME AND YOU: to keep an open mind and to decide on what it is we really want. For, in the end, everybody gets what they really want, as master-trader Ed Sekota would say. I found this book most effective when I took just a few pages a day, rather than trying to assimilate everything in one or two readings. I can effectively couple this book with the works of Dennis Waitley and Guy Finley, and it doesn't have to be about money or fame at all; it could also be about seeking &quot;...treasures that don't fail.&quot; With knees shaking and staff raised as did Moses (or Charleston Heston), I can approach boldly to the throne of God and know that faith, even simpler than a mere mustard seed, is in the speaking, &quot;...the substance of things hoped for and the conviction of things unseen.&quot; As the surprisingly insightful Starfleet Daily Meditational Manual states, &quot;...when we risk the first step toward our dreams, the next step will become clear, then the next, and the next- as if a light begins to illumine our way.&quot; Anthony Robbins walks the talk, but it is upto me and you to take the first step and balance what he says with some of our own study and search, because there's always more than one way to do things. For example, a master web designer can share an approach, but it's always a good idea to get a second professional opinion.	2001-04-11

But I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it for reading, because I think that just the premise will be re-assuring to those in any barefooted search for truth or escape from fear or whatever it is that's tripping your lights man. He has a very crystal clear vision and that's why I am currently re-reading it. I suggest you read it a few times until it sinks in. Big Guy's got it going on man. also has a web-site and gathering in Oregon. BY-JOVEY, THIS MAN IS ON A POSITIVE MISSION.	2001-04-01

Too much talk is boring; had to drink extra coffee to get through some of the verbal marathons, as with other Sam's books, just too much flapping of the mouth. I actually prefer Microsoft online tutorials, neat and concise.	2001-03-26

Mastery of a subject must be coupled with communicating effectively at all levels of student understanding and this is where the author also fails MISERABLY. Sadly, Timothy is another typical member and example of the 'Lousy Teacher Club.' After reading the first chapter, I felt that I wasted two hours of time and as I usually do, I quickly embarked on a search for somebody who can clearly TEACH the subject. I left Timothy at the blackboard mumbling to himself and scooted over to IBM Redbooks with a consortium of world experts. I don't know whether they can teach or not; You'll have to check it out for yourself. For me, effective learning usually means lots of clearly displayed illustrative pictures and hands-on interactive teaching-aids together with typed discussion. I think the instruction should be in shorter chunks so the student isn't overwhelmed by any one lesson. Scott Mueller, another mumbling member of the 'Lousy Teacher Club', wrote an equally miserable book called &quot;Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Eighth Edition.&quot; I dumped Scott's cumbersome writing style and found a great teacher named Charles K. with great coursework at PCGUIDE.COM. Great teachers usually follow one or two guidelines: SIMPLE IS BETTER and in the case of &quot;typewriter-itis&quot;, LESS IS MORE.	2001-03-12

He needs to shut his big fat mouth and provide more concrete pictorial examples. As a technician, I know that the best way to teach is interactive, either through pictures, videos, anything but pages of text. He just whizzes away one page of verbosity after another, MR FLAPPY LIPS can't teach. A failure as a teacher. He just need to SHUT UP and show lots of pictures of screw drivers and equipment and repairs in action. It does no good to make lists of tools you need with names you're not going to remember. This is not a very effective way of teaching something:<br />A) Unscrew chassis cover B) Pull chassis module out from plastic mounts being careful not to break ..... blah, blah, blah<br />This is HIM..

They fail to take the lead and present instructions in a thorough logical sequence. He has a good sense of humor in Teach Yourself... but there are  better choices for the beginner. He says you can use any editor to create &quot;.java&quot; program files, but some editors append &quot;.txt&quot; and it won't work. He also fails to tell you where to place the program files so the system can find them.	2001-02-03
