US	48288188	RWHRMT19U30GM	0941781143	162024473	Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and Her Washington Post Empire	Books	4	38	45	N	N	Liberal Biased Press My You-Know-What	I was really quite surprised at this bio of Katharine Graham, owner of The Washington Post (and Madison Council member of the Library of Congress).<br /><br />I did not realize just how filthy rich this woman was. I found the story of her family (as well as the Jewish heritage) quite fascinating. I did not know, for instance, that her father was responsible for the way stocks are now weighted. That he was able to come up with a scientific (or qualifiable) means to rate stocks was truly revolutionary.<br /><br />It was due to this wealth that Katharine was introduced to the high and mighty at an early age. Being born self-confident and rich always gives people an edge. I was impressed with her education in that, unlike many rich people, she actually tried to make a difference while at school.<br /><br />What is most disturbing is the background on how intelligence agencies completely took over the print media. That individuals like Phil Graham and Ben Bradlee were intelligence agents and believed the press should advance government positions shows just how depraved these individuals really were. Not one of them bothered to read or understand the Constitution and the need for a free press.<br /><br />After Graham died (a tad convenient, don't you think?), Katharine became one of the worst suck-ups to the government. As on page 249, Ward Just was reporting on how badly the Vietnam War was going. Can't have that, you know. Bradlee and Katharine replaced his defeatist reporting with uber-hawk, hack scribbler, and future Library of Congress Director of Communications (brought in by CIA Billington) Peter Braestrup. His take on the Tet Offensive, The Big Story, is always good for a laugh.<br /><br />There is, because of this, much speculation regarding who did Nixon in. Was it a CIA plot? Katharine's relations with the CIA went beyond Phil Graham and Bradlee. Even Bob Woodward was a former intelligence officer. After reading this book you do wonder why these CIA types can't be satisfied with writing their reports from Langley.<br /><br />This book can be a bit weak on sources, but it certainly does give a good overview of just what this woman was really all about.types can't be satisfied with writing their reports from Langley. <br /> <br />This book can be a bit weak on sources, but it certainly does give a good overview of just what this woman was really all about.	2004-10-13

One could also argue that there was nothing positive to say about Nixon.<br /><br />Summers gives an excellent review of Nixon as a young man. Born rather humble, he was the one we can thank for Republicans like Bush always referring to those who disagree as East Coast Liberals, or \\"elites.\\" Forget that Nixon and Reagan had nothing in common with the new Republicans.<br /><br />Nixon was never afraid to work for his money. He was, however, a very driven man with quite a few problems--not the least his penchant for alcohol. According to Summers, Nixon was so desperate to make it to Washington and Congress that he did not mind selling out. He also engaged in extremely underhanded smear campaigns, something raised to an art form under Karl Rove. A good example is Nixon's senate campaign against Helen Douglas, branding her \\"pink right down to her underwear.\\" (page 86) And people were surprised twenty years later?<br /><br />Nixon's role with psychiatrist Arnold Hutschnecker was detailed pretty well. I was surprised that Nixon copied his regal style after Charles de Gaulle. To think we owe so much to the French. I thought it was Nixon oversompensating for his humble beginnings.<br /><br />The real shocker is how Nixon was so abusive. He was known to be verbally abusive, even shoving his aides around. That he basically lost his mind in the end is well detailed. Where the book shows some fraying around the edges is in the foot notes on the physical abuse stories. Evidently Nixon beat Pat a number of times, even sending her to the hospital. If you check the footnotes, however, their ain't much there. There is some fleshing out by Erlichmann and Haldeman, but nothing substantive.<br /><br />Summers gives me one surprise regarding Nixon's reason for taping his conversations. Evidently Nixon was sure Kissinger was such a sneak that he would take credit for detente and other measures. Evidently these foreign policy moves came from Nixon and Nixon alone.<br /><br />This is really quite a tome and I recommend it highly.

The author can write a good story, but very often this devolves into the genre of Commie Literature. This whole thing about \\"revolution,\\" \\"liberation,\\" etc., etc., gets real tiresome.<br />As a former sapper and journalist during the Second Indochina War (using the American History terminology), I found her stories quite interesting. The fact that she was patriotic is nothing to sneer at. She, like women in too many wars, is usually looked down on as a lesbian or slut. This no matter that she is taking the same chances as the men and shows more guts than most men.<br />This book is hard to describe. In \\"The Blue Sky\\" she, as a journalist, tries to tell the truth but is put down by her male editor. In \\"A Very Late Afternoon\\" and \\"Rain\\" she also shows the corruption rampant in Vietnam and how those who travel to the West can do quite well. She also describes the grinding poverty of her country and how people become old before their time. Thanks to communist liberation (my view), the \\"working class\\" have an almost feral existence while the elites continue to skate.<br />I think her longer story \\"A Small Tragedy\\" speaks on a number of levels, most I can't understand. The former mandarin turned communist--naturally after showing his \\"credentials\\" by abandoning his first wife to the crowds--is shown to be heartless and corrupt. This passes on to his daughter, who is always unhappy. In a version of the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex, she meets her perfect groom (described as French although he is a Vietnamese refugee with a French passport), she only finds out too late who he really is. This was a fascinating story put in a Vietnamese perspective.<br />I don't care when a Vietnamese author refers to events I was in as \\"American aggressors\\" as long as they skip \\"feudal running dogs\\" or \\"puppet troops\\" (which actually describes the ARVN, not me). Her writing, though, came pretty close to that style at times. I think Vietnamese writers like her need to recognize one thing: we both showed misplaced patriotism and were used. Her regime was about as corrupt as ours at the time (I was sent by Nixon).h showed misplaced patriotism and were used.

There are two things I hate in any biography: the lack of footnotes as well as incorrect footnotes. He does imbed footnotes, so to say, as describing a certain event or comment, but that just isn't good enough for me. I want the hard stuff when I read a polemic about a creepy guy like Kissinger.<br />In horror movies, the monster always has to be shown stomping on a kitten, or some such thing. The author sets you up by &quot;noting&quot; that Kissinger abused his wife. The author also points out that Kissinger hid his Jewish roots while in the Army during World War II. So what.<br />What made me check this book out was the insistence that Kissinger was a Soviet agent. Now that is really cool. Evidently Kissinger was a communist from the get-go. At Harvard he founded the publication &quot;Confluence&quot;. In 1955 he was investigated by military intelligence (page 29) as the magazine was considered pro-communist. He started his road to fame and fortune by falsely proclaimed to all that he was a White House consultant. Supposedly, but with no footnote (page 31), one noted &quot;I feel certain that if a proper mental diagnosis had been made in 1962, he would have been declared sick.&quot; Okay.<br />What I would like to have seen really detailed was how Kissinger was supposedly a Soviet agent with the code name Bor. The author starts this story on page 74. This all came about with the defection of Col. Goleniewski and his tale of the Soviet spy net called ODRA. Goleniewski brought with him a list of 240 names, one of whom was the Harvard professor Kissinger. Kissinger was recruited rather early and in full swing while at Oberammergau, teaching Military Intelligence as a captain. Other ODRA members who made it big were Guenther Guillaume, the exposure of which brought down Willy Brandt.<br />There are the usual tidbits in this slim volume. Much has been said about Kissinger wiretapping his own people, as well as ordering the breakin of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office, as well as insinuating to Nixon (by then paranoid beyond belief) that a cabal was plotting against him. This cabal happened to be the same people who couldn't stand Kissinger for one reason or another.<br />Once again, I recommend this book for Library of Congress employees since the Librarian of Congress named a chair and lecture series after this creepy guy and indicted war criminal.ffice, as well as insinuating to Nixon (by then paranoid beyond belief) that a cabal was plotting against him.

In fact, it is because of Cat's review I bought this book. What I want to mention are the comparisons to Vietnam. It is a Vietnam vet, Larry Heinemann, who wrote the introduction (see my review of his Paco's Story). I remember when Vietnam veterans went to Russia and met the Afghan vets, but I did not know that Heinemann was one of them.<br />What we get with this book is a sort of stream-of-consciousness telling of experiences. It is as if they were being asked for the first time and they had to get it out fast. I think Heinemann is right, in that it is only a matter of time before Russian veterans start coming out with plays, poetry, movies, etc., of their experiences.<br />As I started to read this book, one thing seemed lacking to me: the ever present humor of veterans. It did, however, start coming through. It takes awhile to understand Russian humor.<br />The stories of females is similar in one way: many were viewed as prostitutes or there just for sex (being plane-janes at home). Donut dollies had to live through that in Vietnam and the Russian women in Afghanistan. What was different was that there were female medics in the field. The civilian woman's story on page 39 captures this, as well as the humor regarding an ugly woman.<br />Being a paratrooper in Vietnam I liked the story starting on page 43. The brutality of the average Russian soldier towards their own, however, is hard for me to understand. He points out how they had the \\"FNG\\" system in their war, where you were nothing until you had done 6 months. It was interesting his story of how Soviet customs stole all the toys they bought with their hard-earned money. The Army set up the largest PX next to where we left, in Long Binh. When I came back from Vietnam to Travis AFB, my stereo was stolen. I screamed at the officer in charge when he told me over 20 were stolen a day. The story starting on page 88 is also similar and very Vietnam.<br />I really got a shock of deja vu on page 110. Drugs were shipped from Vietnam through the bodies of our soldiers to the processing point in Oakland. A huge bust happened toward the end of the war (I could be cynical about the timing).<br />The story starting on page 110 is very Vietnam too. At the end, he mentions that lunatics used to shout out \\"I'm Stalin,\\" but now they shout out \\"I fought in Afghanistan.\\" Wow. Couldn't say that better about our fakes. They also have the same problem in that their fakes are all former Spetsnaz like our fakes are all Green Berets.<br />One huge difference to me was cultural. I just could not imagine a relationship with my mother like those described in the book. Good God! How they tell about their loss, however, is relevant to all of us: those killed had much more to offer than dying in some idiotic useless war. That is one of the real messages you have to come away with when you read this book.starting on page 88 is also similar and very Vietnam.<br />I really got a shock of deja vu on page 110.

I won't waste the reader's time by restating the great parts of this book. I was, for instance, quite involved in Pressman's description of phalanx warfare. Pressman also details the brutal upbringing deemed necessary to create such an ancient warrior.<br />What is lacking, however, in all this historical recreation is the true relationship between the older and younger soldiers. So what, for instance, that ancient Greeks were bisexual? It is a simple matter of fact that young boys were expected to catch the eye of an older man, whether in Athens or Sparta. It happened. Big deal. Get over it.<br />Spartan men were paired not only to teach the younger man the art of war, but for sex as well. As the young man grew to adulthood, this relationship became one of friendship. This was such a problem that Spartan women had their heads shaved on their wedding nights (or night it was consummated) so as not to shock the young male at being so \\"different.\\" If you had spent most of your life around men and a NAMBLA-style relationship it would be \\"different\\" to you too.<br />Just for the sake of comparison, the Theban Sacred Band, made up of 300 pairs of male lovers took this concept of male bonding to the martial extreme. It also was the formation that later crushed the Spartan army.<br />I give this book 5 stars for readability and some historical accuracy, but 1 star for the failure to give the real portrait of Spartan society. Until I hear from Pressman, I will always wonder if his editor made him take this part out so as not to offend the \\"general reading public.\\"	2004-05-17

The secondary reason for the success of this biography is because the author, Blumenson, served as a young lieutenant under Patton.<br />I surprised about a number of facts regarding Patton. First of all, he was dyslexic, but was able to overcome that problem through hard work. He was also kicked by a horse later in life, and this may be the reason for his \\"unstable\\" and volatile character.<br />There are plenty of fun facts in this biography. I was surprised that Patton was an Olympic athlete in the pentathlon. I did not realise, though, that the pentathlon was built around an officer carrying dispatches (i.e., horse, sword, pistol, swimming, running). He also should have placed first, but they could not decide if his pistol round had punched through the same hole twice (so the judges counted it as a complete miss).<br />Patton had many doubts about his manhood. He joked, while at West Point, that he made a fine woman as a dancer. Since West Point only had men at the time, they had to trade off when learning to dance. There is also a serious character flaw in Patton regarding his niece. Although he denied it, it was pretty obvious he was having sex with his niece. This is where we, as the reading public, must give all thanks to the Patton family. They trust Blumenson so much that he is the only man they have given full access to the family papers and letters. At no point did they tell Blumenson to hide anything. They recognized that their family member was an historical figure,and insisted on a complete analysis--warts and all. Otherwise, how can you form an opinion on the man?<br />Blumenson ends his biography with a chapter \\"Behind the Legend.\\" Patton's ideal of leadership is one key to understanding him. On page 307 he states \\"slef-confidence and leadership are twin brothers.\\" As Blumenson states, \\"the sublime irony is that Patton's self-confidence was an act, forced and assumed, put on, riveted to his exterior.\\"<br />Blumenson is quite informative and a must see. He is positive that, had Patton lived a lengthy life, he would have been discredited. He was a real embarrassment, great in war but terrible in peace. The author is also a very humble man, even though he is a retired colonel, and always makes the emphasis when he speaks about Patton.n's self-confidence was an act, forced and assumed, put on, riveted to his exterior.\\"  <br />Blumenson is quite informative and a must see.

I think that this book certainly deserved a Pulitzer, if not more.<br />Vann was a man who did not need to lie, but did even when he did not need to. I found it very surprising how Vann's mother was just a prostitute. More than that, she was quite abusive to the men in her life. This is not just a footnote. Vann's sex problems were what led to his downfall.<br />Vann was active in Vietnam while I was there, but at my level, that of a teenager, I had no idea who he was. Vann was quite a soldier in his own right, but I found it less odd than the author that Vann would embellish his war stories. Telling these stories has less to do with making yourself sound great than just telling an entertaining story. Sometimes it is also better to tell a fake story than one that you experienced.<br />In my opinion, one reason we failed can be seen in the chapter regarding the battle of Ap Bac. Vann is flying overhead and trying to push the South Vietnamese into attacking the VC. They are refusing frontal assaults and casualties, which drives him nuts. Yes, I hated the ARVN too, but who says we had the \\"right\\" way to fight that war anyway, considering the casualties?<br />Vann was a rather manipulative individual--again take a look at his mother. He was certainly brutally honest with some journalists (who in turn got sent out of Vietnam for \\"negative\\" reports), but also used them to his own end.<br />Vann's death was long overdue, based on his taking chances. I was not surprised that his body was looted by the South Vietnamese soldiers. Welcome to my war. The North Vietnamese radio broadcasts not only took credit for downing Vann's helicopter, but condemned his \\"towering crimes.\\" I only got a group condemnation.<br />I thought it was great that Sheehan included the problems with who would meet with Nixon after he died. One of Vann's sons wanted to make an anti-war statement, but was very forcefully told not to even think of it. Vann left quite a wake in his life, with many people sorry he ever rocked their boats.told not to even think of it.

Really, just how can a government employee hide government papers as his own personal papers?<br />A bit out of date, Hitchens details on page 76 how this was done: \\"On leaving the State Department, Kissinger made an extraordinary bargain whereby (having first hastily trucked them for safekeeping on the Rockefeller estate at Pocantico Hills, New York) he gifted his papers to the Library of Congress, on the sole condition that they remained under seal until after his demise. However, Kissinger's friend Manuel Contreras made a mistake when he killed a United States citizen, Ronni Karpen Moffitt, in the Washington car bomb which also murdered Orlando Letelier in 1976. by late 2000, the FBI had finally sought and received subpoena power to review the Library of Congress papers, a subpoena with which Kissinger dealt only through his attorneys.\\" I am also assuming one of Kissinger's attorneys could be listed as the General Counsel of the Library, Elizabeth Pugh.<br />Left out is the story of the man who took the papers under a [tricked] Deed of Gift, signed on Christmas Eve no less, between then Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin and Kissinger. Boorstin, a highly duplicitous man in his own right, is a former communist who named names at the McCarthy hearings. The current Librarian of Congress, right-winger James Billington, is the man who fought the FBI subpoena. Maybe that is because he later named an endowed Library of Congress chair after Kissinger?<br />I particularly liked Hitchens summary of just who Kissinger is on page 16: \\"The signature qualities were there from the [Nixon] inaugural moment: the sycophancy and the duplicity, the power worship and the absence of scruple; the empty trading of old non-friends for new non-friends. And the distinctive effects were also present: the uncounted and expendable corpses; the official and unofficial lying about the cost; the heavy and pompous pseudo-indignation when unwelcome questions were asked...It debauched the American republic and American democracy, and it levied a hideous toll of casualties on weaker and more vulnerable societies.\\" This description goes for a lot of people in power in Washington.<br />One bit of work that needs to be done is to be found on page 110 and concerns the attempted assassination attempt Kissinger helped plan against Greek journalist Elias Demtracopoulos. The journalist had been very critical of the junta of generals who had taken over Greece, engaging in suppression of democracy as well as murder (and tied to Nixon and Kissinger).

What some people fail to gather from this book is that the author was only prompted to write his book after he saw Oliver Stone's &quot;Platoon.&quot; The fact was that Stone was in his platoon and he still remembers him, not to mention staying n touch with reunions.<br />What this book is is a chronological and factual account of his platoon as shown in the movie (at least how he saw things as an officer). Hemphill lets you know that he has three problems with Stone's movie portrayal: there were no large dope parties at the time, no villager was murdered (or raped), and two of his sergeants were not trying to kill each other.<br />If you go to see Hemphill talk about his book, as I have, you can get a real treat. He is quite engaging, even though he still keeps that stiff officer bearing which I always found so annoying. He is a real gas when he repeats his talks with Stone about the film. He even brought a framed set of Stone's handwritten reply to him. Stone sticks to his story that his movie is &quot;fiction,&quot; but Hemphill always counters &quot;so why did you put on the film B Co., 22nd Infantry Regiment?&quot;<br />What grates on Hemphill is the inability of so many people to separate fact from fiction. It is his mission to correct &quot;inaccuracies&quot; in the &quot;fictional&quot; account given by Stone. A fool's errand? In an odd way, by this we actually have Stone and Hemphill, from the same combat company, fighting it out in real life, not Elias and Barnes. Oh, how Hollywood.	2004-05-08

I am also really unsure, after reading this book, about who is taking advantage of whom. Since this book is recommended by the White House, it is obvious &quot;they&quot; are happy with it, even though Cheney and his crew look bad.<br />Many pundits have pointed out that Bush is rather dumb, but they forget that there have been many dumb presidents. There have also been some who were rather intelligent, like Clinton, who were a total disappointment in their decisions and behavior. It is the people they surround themselves with we need to watch. On page 56, you see the breakthrough regarding military theory by Gen Franks, presented to Bush in a slide lecture. On page 57, you see where the only think Bush remembered of this was &quot;the little starbursts on the matrix  but not much of the detail.&quot;<br />ON page 62 you actually see where Franks, with number 8 on the war plan, had stated the Dept. of State would handle the post war. As we all know, Rumsfeld overrode that after the war. At least Woodward shows indeed there had been a postwar plan at one point.<br />Bush and Cheney were out of step with the rest of the world on this war. On page 112 you see, when Cheney visited Arab countries they had a different agenda, to &quot;set the region on some process to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This was the message that Powell had been sending to the White House nonstop. Franks was of like mind. Cheney's other conclusion was that the Middle East was not going in the right direction.&quot; Here, then, is the heart of the problem with this war. For a more complete review of Cheney's war fever, as described by Powell, go to pages 292-295.<br />On page 173 we see where the problem of no WMD is not new. Before the war, Franks tells Bush he sees no WMD as well as Scuds. On page 309 Senator Warner of Virginia tells Bush he will have problems if no WMD found, but I still don't see the &quot;big problems,&quot; especially by him.<br />Woodward does not get all the facts right, in my opinion. On page 78 he states Rumsfeld was a Navy pilot in the 50s. True, but he filed draft deferments to stay out of the Korean War and went in in 1953. On page 13 there is the oft-repeated myth inspectors were kicked out by Saddam in 1998. We pulled them out due to the Desert Fox bombing. On page 263 there is the myth of satellite photos of Iraqi troops massing against Saudi Arabia. Only after the war, when Russian satellite photos were bought, did we find out this was not true. As former Navy intelligence, Woodward should know better.<br />I still think, with the problems and reservations cited, Woodward provides us with a very valuable day-by-day record of how this war was planned. Others quoted try to make Bush look involved, but he still comes across as a Kagemusha controlled by Cheney and his slippery crowd.problems,&quot; especially by him.<br />Woodward does not get all the facts right, in my opinion.

US	48288188	R39IBQEQPBKL6W	0871136791	11590154	Cold Mountain	Books	2	0	1	N	N	A Bit Muddled	The author states that he is \\"copying\\" Homer's \\"Odessey.\\" Okay, now that we have determined that the author is humble and does not have any pretensions we can get down to reviewing this muddled mess.<br />I hate to complain (no I don't, but that is the fine print), but I would appreciate some realims in a supposedly realistic novel of the American Civil War. I also want to skip over the \\"must have\\" items in any contemporary American novel that all editors insist on having. What I am talking about are the \\"sensitive, handsome and heroic male protagonist,\\" the \\"strong, independent woman he yearns for against convention,\\" and the \\"horribly evil 'entity' whose name must not be spoken.\\" Frazier also did not forget the must-have \\"imps\\" (this time an albino) who help him in all his evil deeds.<br />Now that I have dispensed with the card-board cutouts, I'll take a swing at the \\"history\\" (quotation mark alert). Here is just one ridiculous history lesson. On page 68, for instance, Inman is shot at by a Whitworth sniper rifle. These rifles were the undisputed favorites of Confederate snipers. They were imported from England in small numbers, and had a killing range of 1,500 yards. The twisting hexagonal bore was what gave this .45 calibre rifle its accuracy. The problem is that this unique rifle shot a very unique and expensive bullet, meaning no sniper would waste a shot like that--not to mention missing Inman by a mile. This is simply not believable, but makes for sexy reading, impressing the New York editors who don't know jack. Having a yahoo shoot from the river bank ain't enough.<br />My other complaint about \\"history\\" is the fact that all Civil War heroes must have fought at Gettysburg, Fredericksburg, Antietam (okay, Sharpsburg), The Crater, etc. But, hey, why not have this super-hero fight at all of the above? Better than that, put him in the middle of the line each time. My ancestors were at Gettysburg (9th Georgia Infantry, the winning side), but they fought in the Wheat Field. Ain't good enough.<br />But the truth for this novel would have had a negative effect. Or maybe it would have made it better? Frazier places Inman in the center of the line during Picketts Charge (Longstreet's Assault). I hate to break this news, but the North Carolinians held the LEFT during the charge. Worse for the book, the North Carolinians were accused of cowardice during the charge, as they were the first to falter (they were enfiladed) and retreated, leaving Pickett isolated and bound to fail. I guess that means Inman, if he were alive today, would be lying his ass off about his war record.<br />If you want an easy-to-read book , I would recommend this. I just wish the ones being touted for \\"historical\\" accuracy as an historical novel would actually describe real life. Believe it or not, the Civil War was much more interesting to the real participants than this.Wheat Field. Ain't good enough.<br />But the truth for this novel would have had a negative effect.

The latter gives you a good overview of the whole campaing, whereas the former provides a very focused view.<br />Naturally, it is best to view all options, but I prefer to read the first-person accounts for some real perspective. This is what you get--the unvarnished look at how one company dealt with the catastrophe of Chosin, turning it into a victory (no matter what the Chinese reviewer has to say). That one division, the 1st Marine Division, was able to survive against ten Chinese division, and survive intact as a fighting force, speaks volumes of the men in that division.<br />When you read how Owen and his men coped, you can appreciate the fighting capabilities of the American soldiers--particulary when they are put in unprepared situations by idiots like MacArthur and his so-called intelligence officers in Tokyo fighting by remote-control. Owen showed how the men in the field could see the train-wreck coming, but were never listened to. This is where the first-person account deviates from the outside approach with the old &quot;we told you so&quot; and can prove it.<br />I would also like to mention that I have met Owen and Chew Enn Lee, when they gave a talk on the book. You could not imagine two more opposites in personality. Lee, who goes by &quot;Karl,&quot; is still to this day highly respected by his men. They have petitioned the Department of Defense for Karl to receive the Medal of Honor for leading part of the breakout. No matter how much they petition on his behalf, it just falls on deaf ears. I think this is just the continuation of the we-know-better-than-you that permeates the rarified air breathed by higher ups. When you see what Bob Kerrey did for his Medal of Honor--and not taking anything away from him--you wonder why Karl Lee walked away with less.	2004-05-01

I hate to put it that way, but I hope Weigl is not offended and takes it as a compliment.<br />Song of Napalm has some previous poetry, but that is okay.<br />&quot;Mercy&quot; speaks to me as a Vietnam veteran. When I got back from Vietnam I was actually refused a part-time job stripping shingles from a roof. The only job I got--and I had to argue for that one--at the time was pumping gas. At least I went to college and got a master's, but I do feel sorry for those who never had a chance. That is why I also ask for mercy, but never saw it coming my way.<br />&quot;Song for the Lost Private&quot; is another highly personal poem (what else is poetry). Those who never lost a friend over there can never understand our level of frustration. Weigl certainly gives you a good idea, though with &quot;you didn't show/so I drank myself into a filthy room with a bar girl/who had terrible scars.&quot;<br />&quot;On the Anniversary of her Grace&quot; is an outstanding poem regarding the connection (or disconnection) with our time in Vietnam and how it intrudes on life today. &quot;Inside me the war had eaten a hole. I could not touch anyone. The wind blew through me to the green place/where they still fell in their blood.&quot; Speaking of attempts to love again, he ends the poem with &quot;but I could not open my arms to her/that first night of forgiveness.&quot; And, like just who are we going to forgive, also crosses my mind?<br />&quot;Elegy,&quot; appropriately, is the final poem in this slim book, which needs to be savored in small doses. &quot;Into the black understanding they marched/until the angels came/calling their names/until they rose, one by one from the blood.&quot; It ends with &quot;Some of them died. Some of them were not allowed to.&quot; I can't think of a more proper way to end a book on Vietnam.	2004-05-01

Even the arranged marriages of American heiresses with busted-flat British royalty was a one-time thing, but the House of Bush and House of Saud generational arrangement should be a Kabuki tragedy or neo-realist Chinese film.<br />At any rate, Unger gets your blood flowing by noting that a transplant patient is about to die and waiting for his new heart on 9/11. Unfortunately, the plane with his heart is forced down by Air Force jets, with time running out. At this same time, House of Saud family members, as well as bin Laden family, are allowed to fly home.<br />The House of Saud was very patient and tried to buy influence, Unger showing how they started with Carter's people, especially Bert Lance and Clark Clifford. These were light weights, though, to the House of Bush. I should digress and point out that Unger also shows how the House of Saud also formed an early alliance with the family responsible for Wahhabism. The House of Saud was quite brutal and ruthless at the turn of the century and continues to be so.<br />(...)P>To make your blood boil, though, read Chapter 10, \\"Masters of the Universe.\\" This is all about the secretive Carlyle Group, and how the House of Saud gave the group and House of Bush 1.4 billion--yes billion with a \\"b\\"--in US dollars. You can buy a country with that kind of money, that's for sure. After that, go to pages 263-269 and see what Al Qaede's Number 3 Abu Zubaydah had to say and how that was handled. Yeah, with friends like that.<br />I also have to mention that there is plenty of humor in this book. Jerry Jones, oil billionaire, had the habit of allowing Prince Bandar onto the field during games. Unfortunately, Bandar always brought 40 bodyguards with him. This was so distracting that it once caused a fumble. Coach Johnson was so irate he locked Jones and Bandar out of the locker room once. This, according to Unger, is the primary reason for the break-up of the Jones-Johnson leadership of the Dallas Cowboys. And to think we never even knew.ding to Unger, is the primary reason for the break-up of the Jones-Johnson leadership of the Dallas Cowboys. And to think we never even knew.	2004-04-25

What is most irritating is that this book is out of print, while the cheap knock-offs keep rolling!!<br />Pratt has compiled a cross section of everything, from literature to music to poetry, to help explain the Vietnam War from start to finish. As the subtitle explains, this is from 1941-1982, so you get the French view as well as American, North and South Vietnamese mixed in. If you look on page 187 you will also even see a Swedish poem by Goran Sonnevi based on what he saw on television! This is why I say this should have been 10 volumes. And, like, why is poet Bruce Weigl missing?<br />What is interesting is how Pratt also chose to compile this volume. By that, I mean that authors writing in 1979 on what they saw in 1965 are interspersed with what was reported that year. His Prologue is 1941-May 1955, with an Epilogue for 1975-1982. Each &quot;Act&quot; starts with a page of GI graffiti, such as &quot;As I slide down the banister of life I'll always remember Veitnam as a splinter in my ass.&quot; Believe me, I saw this and much better by 1971. Sometimes, you just had to be there to understand the humor and what it was all about.<br />What is also important is that Pratt also included the casualties for each year. Curious about how my year stacked up with the current situation in Iraq, I noticed we had about 156,000 troops in Vietnam in Vietnam which suffered 1,381 killed and 8,936 wounded. Seems to be getting close by that calculation. I also liked the inclusion of the Christmas song at the end of the 1971 section. We actually sang that in Christmas 1971. The refrain &quot;Take your Merry Christmas cheer and shove it up your ass&quot; got louder each time. We supplied the free fireworks for that and New Year's. Sure beats waving sparklers.<br />Like I say, my only complaint is that this was never seen as the definitive compilation for Vietnam. What I would like to see would be a much more ambitious project along these same lines.ch more ambitious project along these same lines.	2004-04-25

The &quot;Iliad&quot; comes to mind. Most English literature classes also throw in poetry from World War I, which produced the likes of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Not since Vietnam has American Literature produced such fine poets. Thanks to the best-known Vietnam War poet Will Ehrhart, ofter described as the &quot;Poet Laureate of the Vietnam War,&quot; we have a number of such poets being published.<br />Ehrhart (Marine) is known for early work such as &quot;A Relative Thing,&quot; an angry statement reminding America that we returned veterans did &quot;your&quot; work (&quot;accomplices in this travesty of dreams&quot;) and that &quot;we are your sons, America, and you cannot change that.&quot; In &quot;Letter,&quot; we see hope on the horizon.<br />Bruce Weigl (Army) is my second favorite poet. It is from his &quot;Monkey&quot; that the title of this collection comes from. &quot;Burning **** at An Khe&quot; speaks to us Vietnam veterans on more than one level. &quot;Song for the Lost Private,&quot; about the death of a friend, and &quot;Anna Grasa,&quot; about his reaction to a family &quot;welcome home&quot; truly capture some of our inner feelings.<br />Walter McDonald (Air Force) can write some varied poetry, from people to places. &quot;For Kelly, Missing In Action,&quot; and &quot;For Harper, Killed In Action,&quot; are about obvious topics. Likewise, &quot;After the Noise of Saigon,&quot; and &quot;For Friends Missing in Action&quot; should be read in tandem. His &quot;Interview with a Guy Named Fawkes, U.S. Army&quot; is simply too witty for description.<br />Bryan Alec Floyd (Marine) writes one of the most poignant poems in this book. All his poems in this collection are named after individuals. His &quot;Private First Class Brooks Morgenstein, U.S.M.C.&quot; is the one poem all should read. Brooks has a wife at home, and this is the sole reason for his being and his survival. &quot;He only knew as he held his rifle/during a sweeping operation/that next year he would hold her/and when he kissed her/his tongue would touch hers/and she would feel/as though a piece of the sun/was in her mouth.&quot; <br />I know I am leaving out all the other fine poets represented in this book, not least Jan Barry, a close frind of Ehrhart's. We all owe our gratitude not just to the poets of the Vietnam War, but most certainly to Will Ehrhart for ceaselessly working to bring us this exceptionally beautifull form of expression.	2004-04-04

The author, Marshall Goldman, was suddenly asked by the reviewer what he thought about top Mafia thug Mikhail  Khodorkovsky giving a million dollars to the Library of Congress (as a means of legitimizing himself). Naturally, as I work at the Library of Congress, I perked up, paid attention, and then bought the book. Wow.<BR> <BR>Khodorkovsky (currently in jail) started out as a good little communist, belonging to the Komsomol, and going to college. Johnny on the spot, he parlayed a small bank charter for<BR>Menatep to become Russia's richest man. Unfortunately, Menatep was involved in the Bank of New York money laundering scheme, bilking the US out of billions. In 1994, the Federal Reserve ordered the CIA to investigate Russian banks, a study which concluded most Russian banks are Mafia controlled. Although the study is still classified, Menatep was the only bank publicly noted for being Mafia controlled (page148). Knodorkovsky started Yukos Oil, which was a swindle. Using this money, Khodorkovsky, with Henry Kissinger as a member of his board, gave one million dollars to the Library of Congress to start the Open Russia Foundation (page 149). <br />Another Library of Congress rent-a-thug was Vladimir Gusinsky. Gusinsky predated Khodorkovsky--probably because he's currently on the lam--and had helped fund the Librarian of Congress' Russia documentary film. Gusinsky had actually attended the University of Virginia to study financial management. He named his business empire MOST (a play on the word bridge)after the sign on ATM machines. Goldman also provides us with the \\"how\\" of how these two Mafia \\"oligarchs\\" could seem presentable given their backgrounds. Somebody got them the services of APCO, which is an offshoot of Arnold and Porter, a top DC law firm full of congressmen and other movers and shakers (page 129). The rest is history, as they say.<BR> <BR>I also just have to mention one of the Russian jokes that Goldman repeats. Due to broad government theft this one circulated: A man parked under Yeltsin's office and walked away. A guard rushed up and said \\"You can't park under Yeltsin's office.\\" \\"It's okay, the man replied, \\"I locked the car.\\" <br />Goldman gives us the backgrounds and histories of all the top \\"oligarchs\\" and an explanation any layman can understand regarding just how Russia became so corrupted. This book, then, is not just for Library of Congress employees looking to see who the latest donors to our institution are.<br />Our Librarian of Congress, James Billington, is a former Sovietologist and \\"Russian scholar,\\" so I suppose he knows what he is doing. Here is what Goldman thinks, though, \\"The more involved Russian businessmen become with the West, the more likely it is that they will come to adopt Western business practices, presumably good ones. But there is no guarantee. Given how deeply ingrained some of the less desirable practices are among Russian administrators (past and present) it is only to be expected that some of the more nefarious behaviour we have encountered inside Russia will also surface outside (page 118).\\"	2004-04-03

The author served in Vietnam as a nurse from 1969-70. Since I met her at a book reading at the Library of Congress, I got the straight dope on this book.<br />O'Neill decided to write a collection of stories similar to Tim O'Brien. It would be a collection of different stories that would reflect her tour, written chronologically. What is rather clever is that the author broke the book down into three parts. Each part regards where she served: Phu Bai, Chu Lai, and Cu Chi.<br />The fact is these stories just can't be faked. The first story,&quot;The Boy From Montana,&quot; is basically an initiation. You learn the reason not to get too close to wounded soldiers. Just how do you cope, as a nurse, with seeing young men die every day? In this story, there was no conversation per se, as the wounded man made only one reply to a question. If you take this story in combination with &quot;Prometheus Burned,&quot; you really understand the psychological pain nurses suffered by having the soldiers die literally in their arms.<br />The fun part was the recurring character of SP4 Scully, the devious company clerk. The protaganist, in &quot;The Exorcism,&quot; is harassed by a ghost. The author takes you back to Vietnam with her ridiculous discussions with the young female Catholic Vietnamese girl who tries to help her get rid of the ghost. Only Scully can swing the deal--at the cost of her prized pizza mixes. Scully surfaces a couple of more times but the end, when he gives her a &quot;big hand&quot; for her tour, is priceless.<br />Other reviewers have written about the monkey, starting in &quot;Monkey on our Backs.&quot; These things really were a menace. Some guys thought they were just so cute, getting them loaded, then watching them hop around throwing excrement at us. Yeah, real fun. The only &quot;trained monkey&quot; I remember was in the 2nd Bn, 5th Cav, when I went to visit a friend. I wasn't the only one who wanted to kill the monkey that day. (I am a cat person anyway.)<br />What is sad is that this book suffered from bad timing. It was released around 9-11, which meant nobody was paying attention to it. When the author got a call from England, her &quot;good luck&quot; held out and the Queen Mum died during O'Neill's book tour.

The author provides us with an incredibly vivid description of fighting inside a tank. The author (as well as the protaganist Chet Brown) was a tank loader in Gulf War I.<br />If you think we got the goods on everybody else, you need to read and reread this book until you catch the part about having to use WD-40 as a means to unjam the weapons from sand. The equipment seems to work only half the time. So much for technology.<br />I have never been inside a tank and the author gives an incredibly vivid description of how you feel the shock of firing the main gun and how the blast throws you against the hull. What a rush. You also have to go back to WWI and Wilfred Owen and Remarque to get descriptions of gas warfare. Want to know how it feels to fight wearing a gas mask with limited vision? Read this book.<br />Truth in Advertizing: my complaints are personal as a Vietnam veteran. It is unfortunate that crazy Viet vet has found its way into this otherwise excellent book. Why not just have the average town nut? The badass sherriff was a former member of the 7th Cav, which is a unit I served in. The protaganist's father was the battalion commander of the 7th Cav and died KIA in 1971. Don't remember that. Nope. Find another battalion commander.<br />This is a &quot;returned veteran&quot; story as well as a combat story. If you look at &quot;Paco's Story,&quot; also reviewed by me, there is quite a difference in protaganists in similarly composed novels. Both protaganists are drifter types, but Paco is a hard and honest worker. Paco is strange, but Chet is a mess. I had a sense of hope with Paco, but knew al along Chet was headed for a dead end. I was looking for something redemptive, but was dissapointed. The underlying odd humor that combat veterans like to insert into novels, like and inside joke, seems to be missing. Maybe that is just me and maybe I missed it with my reading.<br />I have met the author and have to say he is very quiet and unassuming.

US	48288188	R178PS5LMLMJ6F	0891414061	143545242	The Fall of Eben Emael	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Good Early Special Ops Book	I think the author, who himself served in WWII as a glider infantry author, was the right one to write this book. If you looked toward the end, on page 167 (of the hardbound book), you see what this is all about. Mrazek starts with a great Victor Hugo quote, \\"No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come.\\" Then you see the accomplishment of the German glider assault on the fort: \\"Seventy-seven boldly led men, ten gliders costing about 77,000 Deutsche marks, and fifty-six hollow-charge explosives defeated 780 men defending the world's strongest fort.\\"<br />I think the author does a good job of giving the background of how this strong fort, Eben Emael, fell due to two new  military developments: the glider and the hollow charge. This is a limited and small book, but Mrazel does show us how Germany, denied an air force, took to gliders. With necessity the mother of invention, it stands to reason the Germans would find a way to make the glider a weapon. This they did in front of Hitler in 1936. Mrazek shows how Hitler remembered this and was the one who gave the order to take Eben Emael with gliders. There is a reason for this decision. German paratroopers could not control their descent as their risers were not steerable, which strung them out on a drop (forget the Hollywood nonsense). Weapons were dropped separately. The glider put the men on the ground together with their weapons. The one complaint I have is that the author does provide a photo of a German paratroop drop, which would have helped show this tactical problem of theirs.<br />Mrazek devotes some time, with drawings, to explain the significance of the hollow charge. This explosive was so powerfull it scared not just the Belgian defenders when used, but the German attackers as well. Take a look at the photos in the book and you see what I mean. The cupolas look like they were hit with smart bombs from an air strike.<br />The author uses drawings to show where each German unit attacked, which I think adds an interesting dynamic to the telling of this story. (The units and names of each man are provided at the back.) Some authors can be very general and skip the facts that some soldiers would find more interesting, such as just who attacked Cupola 30. I actually took the time to compare the diagrams to the photos and then back to the attacking unit.<br />This is pretty much the definitive book an this amazing attack. Note that the author personally interviewed nine attackers and defenders, including German General Student, the man told by Hitler to attack the fort with gliders.which I think adds an interesting dynamic to the telling of this story.

Unlike some Vietnam veteran authors who seem stuck on Vietnam, Webb can certainly shift gears.<br />Former Marine Brandon Conley is the protagonist. In a word, Conley reflects what Webb is really like, at least in my humble opinion as one who has met him. I merely mention this as I think this is an important point to consider. Webb is fluent in Vietnamese, just like the character (alter-ego) Conley, he is steeped in the culture of the Vietnamese, and he does indeed offer prayers for deceased former enemies as in the book. In short, he is a complex character.<br />The understanding of Vietnamese culture is what comes out in the book. Yes the plot takes a back seat, but must we be so picky? Many of the incidents in the book actually took place during Webb's numerous visits to Vietnam. For instance, the North Vietnam driver really did turn to him when the officer left and speak pidgeon English to him, praising America. Webb thought it so great that he wrote that incident into the book. And Webb truly seems struck, as in the book when he offers a proper prayer in front of the family for their deceased family members. Webb describes in meticulous detail how the photos are arranged. The different generations, as exhibited by Colonel Pham and his daughter Van, who wants freedom and modernity, is what is truly happening in Vietnam<br />Also of interest are the descriptions of the former ARVN soldiers and the social discrimination directed against them. As a form of punishment, no former ARVN soldier is allowed to rise above menial labor. They are all placed in a ghetto in Saigon (or Ho Chi Minh City) so they can be watched. Webb shows their plight through an incident that exposes their inability to afford proper health care as well as a proper burial. They are constantly humiliated and reminded that they and their progeny will never rise any further.<br />Webb also wove his book around the myth of Salt and Pepper. These two, one white and one black, supposedly went to the other side during the war. Their sightings were, to me, like sightings of Elvis and Sasquatsch. I really don't know if they existed, but I certainly heard about them while I was in Vietnam. Most soldiers telling me this actually believed all the stories circulating.<br />What Webb did was put the Salt and Pepper story into the context of the deserters who simply went to live in Saigon, making a living supposedly selling drugs. This was no lie, as there were estimated to be about 500 such souls at the end of the war. Since they took their weapons with them, the MP's became involved in firefights when they got too close. What became of them is anybody's guess (a great fictional plot device, like in the book).<br />Going back to Vietnam is a very tricky subject and can evoke a strong reaction from many Vietnam veterans. We all know of the beauty of Vietnam, but Webb know first-hand the ugly side of Vietnam and describes it well. I did not think this book warrented 5 stars, but would have given it 4 and a half if I could.hese two, one white and one black, supposedly went to the other side during the war. Their sightings were, to me, like sightings of Elvis and Sasquatsch. I really don't know if they existed, but I certainly heard about them while I was in Vietnam. Most soldiers telling me this actually believed all the stories circulating.<br />What Webb did was put the Salt and Pepper story into the context of the deserters who simply went to live in Saigon, making a living supposedly selling drugs. This was no lie, as there were estimated to be about 500 such souls at the end of the war. Since they took their weapons with them, the MP's became involved in firefights when they got too close. What became of them is anybody's guess (a great fictional plot device, like in the book).<br />Going back to Vietnam is a very tricky subject and can evoke a strong reaction from many Vietnam veterans.

He was talking about his book when he was interrupted and the interviewer asked Marshall Goldman about Russian Mafia PR campaign on US government officials.(...)In the book there is a brief mention of this fact on page 149, \\"To show how public-spirited YUKOS [the Mafia-run oil giant] had become, it donated $1 million to the U.S. Library of Congress and set up an Open Russia Foundation with, among others, Henry Kissinger as a member of the board of trustees.\\" It was James Billington, the current Librarian of Congress and former \\"Sovietologist\\" professor who brought them all together. Wow.<br />This book is not just about the Mafia figure, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who ownes YUKOS. What sets Goldman's book apart from others I have read, such as \\"Comrade Criminal,\\" is the description of what went wrong in Russia when the Soviet Union fell. Dr. Goldman paints a rather bleak picture. Goldman explains the how and why of the vouchers scam and how out of Russia, a certain overnight class of incredibly rich \\"oligarchs\\" came on the scene. Goldman shows how these billionaires never developed an economy, at one point contrasting how in Poland the problems that occured in Russia never arose.<br />If you want to lose sleep you need to read this book as the inroads of Russian Mafia-controlled in America should cause real alarm. As cited on page 118, \\"The Russian were supposed to adopt out ways, not bring their ways to the United States.\\" Congress is well aware of all this, as on page 128 Goldman relates how the CIA reported that half of Russia's banks were Mafia controlled. The only bank to be so named publicly is MENATEP (page 148). The man the Librarian of Congress brought to the Library of Congress was not just the founder of MENATEP, but also involved in the Bank of New York money laundering.<br />The two chapters on the oligarchs (pages 98-156)make for heavy reading, especially since two of the oligarchs are (now were) directly involved with the Library of Congress, Vladimir Gussinsky (who fled Russia) and Khodorkovsky (arrested in his jet and currently in jail in Russia). Goldman really gives you the average Russian viewpoint of these oligarchs and the Putin reactions. That the oligarchs are intertwined with the KGB and the fact that the Russian government is predominated by KGB types is described by Goldman. His repeating of jokes really gives the feel, like the one about the subway rider who asks the man standing on his foot if he is from Petersburg (Mafia central) or the KGB. When the man says neither, he is then asked \\"then why are you standing on my foot?\\" The other great joke describes the outright theft of the country through the story of the man who parks his car under the window of Yeltsin's office. You can't park under Yeltsin's office the guard says, which the man responds \\"It's okay, I locked my car.\\"<br />It is all this together than makes this book a classic.(...)ow were) directly involved with the Library of Congress, Vladimir Gussinsky (who fled Russia) and Khodorkovsky (arrested in his jet and currently in jail in Russia).

US	48288188	R394Q2WC89PNKJ	0449132595	389266887	Unknown Soldier	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A bit of a hack job	In a way, this is (or could have been) an intriguing book regarding the Unknown Soldier who was buried in Arlington. I was there for the ceremony and it happened just as the author described in the book. (The only description missing was the dopey DC motorcycle cop who decided to weave his bike through the honor guard lining the main road. So respectfull!!) There were no planes though and we Viete vets really were barred from entering the Cemetery for the ceremony. The author does a good job of also describing the lab in Hawaii and how the remains are identified.<br />The premise is rather clever. What was the motive for Reagan to bury an Unkonwn Soldier? Was it to lay to rest the sticky point over MIAs and abandoned soldiers? To shut up the POW family networks? Was the man identified actually murdered and the burial a means to cover that up? Was the body actually identifiable? This turned out to be true, which started the conspiracy theories.<br />Grounds for a great who-dunit, right? But, for the most part, the book is a bit of a hack job. On page 127, Walt Meredith is described as a middle aged man and former &quot;daredevil mercenary in Vietnam.&quot; Oh puh-leese, never just a regular Joe. He also is a babe magnet for women half his age--something I suffer from too along with all the other middle-aged Vietnam veterans. And why are they always blonds with green eyes? I can never go out without my wife getting in countless fistfights with these women. We never seem to attract cute Asian women, though, in books like this. Don't fat women find us attractive?<br />Some of the descriptions are really annoying. There are also plenty of crazy and murderous Viet vets for those who like that genre. How about this on page 241, &quot;Daddy, did you also cut Krauts' ear and wear them on a string, as a necklace, for everybody to see?&quot; (In actuality, the SS--if you can believe that--filed written complaints about the mutilation and murder of German wounded by Americans after Market Garden.) Another Viet vet, on page 259, is described as &quot;[a]weird guy...Boy, he was weird. You had to see him. Long hair, long beard, used to run barefoot in the woods ... It was Vietnam his wife said.&quot; Yeeeaaah, okaaaay. Seen it a million times--in Hollywood.<br />Like I say, this moves along like all those other who-dunits you see in airport shops. Well written but with all the cliches.after Market Garden.) Another Viet vet, on page 259, is described as &quot;[a]weird guy...Boy, he was weird. You had to see him.

First of all, Clarke pretty well discredits Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II equally, but for different reasons. For instance, for all the rhetoric, Reagan never retaliated for the Beirut bombing. But Clarke also explains how we were fighting blind and eventually put the pieces together.<br />Clinton is criticized even though you do not get this from the news. As one example, Clarke speaks about wanting to shut down the &quot;secret&quot; Arab form of banking known as &quot;hawala.&quot; (He does not explain it, but this comes from the Arab root &quot;to move.&quot;) The Clinton FBI reported back to him there was no such thing in America. How incompetent and idiotic can the FBI be? I, along with other Americans, have used &quot;hawalas&quot; in small purchases on Ebay. The only difference is that I have lived in the Middle East and knew what the system was.<br />My last point is that one would not know from watching the news that 911 was avoidable. The news falsely frames the question with Clarke asking if we could have stopped 911 by killing bin Laden. Within that false context the answer is &quot;no.&quot; If you read the book, you see how Clarke points out the Millenium Plot was foiled by people working together with daily briefings and exchange. He clearly states--and this is why you should read this book--had this same urgency been shown by Condi Rice as with Sandy Berger we probably could have stopped the attacks. Want further insight about priorities? Read what Clarke says Rumsfeld was doing on 911.<br />How correct Clarke is on his assumptions time will only tell.	2004-03-26
US	48288188	R2DLAJ9BSIN8FZ	0140100857	603106256	Paco's Story	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Up with the best for returned veteran stories	When I first started this book, I had to put it down for a few days and read something else. The rambling \\"device\\" at first put me off as annoying. I warmed to the unusual style, however, on the second try and was amply rewarded. As a Vietnam veteran I can be easily offend with the \\"loser\\" image of a returned veteran. But this is misleading. Paco is severely wounded and simply wants to work hard (most likely a penitent) and be left alone. He finds his safe harbor in Ernest, the owner of the Texas Lunch diner, where he washes dishes (washing away his sins, yes yes I get it). Ernest's ramblings about combat on Iwo and Guadalcanal add a great coda and understanding. Heinemann really brings these characters to life, especially the talk about combat and how they feel. The most intriguing character is Jesse, another vagabond Viet vet who stops for dinner. As I am also a former paratrooper, Jesse's rantings and observations are priceless. Pay attention to what Jesse says about the \\"proposed\\" Vietnam Memorial. Understand Scruggs's idea came about in March 1979, with Heinemann publishing excerpts of this book starting in 1979 (winning the Book Award in 1987). But Cathy gives us a view of how others see us, no matter how unfair that may be. Cathy at first sees Paco as \\"cute\\" then \\"ugly\\" as she observes him night after night with his nightmares. What Paco reads in Cathy's diary is what many civilians felt about us deep down and their refusal to help in reintegration. One final unrelated note: one reviewer of this book may be unaware that Caputo served in Vietnam, whereas Clancy never served in the military. Heinemann is the real deal, with characters very real to me and my experiences.	2004-02-14

The author tracked down dozens of eyewitness accounts of the raid and aftermath, from diaries, memoirs, interviews, newspapers, and articles. This is the first true and complete account of the Lawrence Raid, using on reported dialogue, written in a novelized form. All characters and events in this book are real. A prologue and epilogue are also provided for historical context.\\"<br />  When Michael Shaara wrote \\"Killer Angels,\\" concerning the Battle of Gettysburg, he supposedly used only dialogue reported by eyewitnesses. I used this as the basis for \\"Vengeance In My Heart,\\" a story about the Lawrence Raid. Since the raid is rather obscure compared to Gettysburg, I produced a hybrid, the Prologue and Epilogue providing historical background that might be unknown to the reader. The novelized portion uses only reported dialogue, culled from the written records, as well as period photographs for descriptions.<br />  Obtaining the reports on this raid was a lengthy process. The most complete version of the raid comes from Connelley's \\"Quantrill and the Border Wars.\\" What I learned studying for my master's in US History was never to trust a footnote. Unfortunately, a number of Connelley's footnotes on sources were wrong. To compound this confusion, all subsequent books on the raid, such as Goodrich's \\"Bloody Dawn,\\" used the same false footnotes for the same incidents in the raid. It is evident these subsequent authors regurgitated Connelley's version of events. In order to provide the most complete version of events, I tracked down numerous eyewitness reports never before cited. Using the opening attack on the Eldridge House as one example, I spent months assembling all the disparate writings like a jigsaw pussle to produce the most complete chronological description of that event.<br />  Another device I used in writing this book was to eschew using the standard literary device of telling a story through one individual. With the possible exception of Larkin Skaggs (who was killed near the end), no Confederate guerrilla was everywhere, just as no citizen of Lawrence saw every incident and killing. What the reader should come away with while reading the book is a sense of the chaos of the raid. A citizen would be spared by one group of guerrillas only to be shot down by the next group.riting this book was to eschew using the standard literary device of telling a story through one individual.
