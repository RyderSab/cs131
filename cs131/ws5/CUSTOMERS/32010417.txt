That surely is the case here; the absolute, #1, best story here, bar none, is John Helfers' \\"Changeling.\\"  This uses one of the oldest plotlines anywhere (that of an Elf baby being exchanged for a human baby) to explore the problems of adoption in a brand new light.  The Elfling never quite \\"fits,\\" and when he finds out the truth of his birth and adoption, goes to look for his birth parents.  And what he finds . . . well, let's just say that I was reasonably sure how it'd end, but Mr. Helfers did an excellent job in keeping me riveted to the page until the story was complete. <br /> <br />Five stars plus with the highest recommendation possible for \\"Changeling.\\" <br /> <br />Two other stories were very good, and nearly up to Mr. Helfers' in quality.  These were the stories by Charles de Lint and Tim Waggoner.  Both of these stories were interesting, well thought out, and I enjoyed them very much.  Five stars for each of them. <br /> <br />I didn't really care for Ms. Huff's story or Ms. West's story, but other folks might like them.  I'd give those stories a three rating (so-so), with the remaining stories all three and a half to four ratings.  Which is why the anthology gets an overall four-star rating. <br /> <br />And while I'd recommend the anthology itself anyway, I highly recommend Mr. Helfers' exceptional story, \\"Changeling.\\"  Read it.  It's very good, probably one of the best short stories I've read all year. (And I've read a whole lot of good ones.) <br /> <br />Barb Caffrey	2004-08-15
US	32010417	R3JYJY2ZZJH9M9	0345447603	459337150	Trading in Danger	Books	4	43	49	N	N	A good start to a new series	TRADING IN DANGER is a very good read; it's compelling, it's interesting, has many plot elements, and has a likable protagonist. Ms. Moon did an excellent job with the military elements, as I've come to expect over the years of reading her books; she was a military officer, and her analysis and understanding of military matters is spot on. <br />  <br /> Thing is, Kylara Vatta's character definitely is that of a maverick wunderkind, which reminds me a bit of the Moon-Anne McCaffrey collaboration SASSINAK, at least of the stuff while Sassinak is young. That's not bad, mind; I enjoyed SASSINAK, and I enjoyed this, too (and the characters really aren't much alike, except for being smart women who've found a way to survive). Nor is this the female version of Miles Vorkosigan, either; Kylara Vatta is not a cell-damaged man stuck in a military society, and I didn't think much about the possible parallels to Lois McMaster Bujold's THE WARRIOR'S APPRENTICE until the book was over. <br />  <br /> Trust me; the books aren't that much alike, and I don't think TRADING IN DANGER is a copy of anything. <br />  <br /> The only current book I can think of that's anything like this one is Steve Miller and Sharon Lee's BALANCE OF TRADE, although that's not very close, either; still, both TRADING IN DANGER and BALANCE OF TRADE show people making a living by trade and enjoying it. I do think if you liked BALANCE OF TRADE, you should like TRADING IN DANGER as well. <br />  <br /> The pluses of this book? It has a very strong female heroine who is self-willed and highly motivated, even if she does get down on herself reasonably often (as young adults often do; sometimes even us older ones). I liked the trade, and the military action, and most of the minor characters (especially the woman from the ISC; her line about &quot;not apologizing for not meeting your prejudices&quot; -- paraphrase mine -- because she was a military vet who dressed in a feminine way really tickled me). And it really was a page-turner. <br />  <br /> The minuses? Some of the sub-plots were started and stopped, some for comic effect, some perhaps because there was no room for them here. And I'd have preferred to see a few less people saying how wonderful Kylara was/is; yes, I expect it from her father and some of the others, but a little goes a long way. I'd rather intuit that sort of thing by Kylara's actions, and I'd already made up my mind that she was, in the parlance of this book, &quot;a good'un.&quot; <br />  <br /> So is this a perfect book? No. Is it Ms. Moon's best book? Probably not. Does it measure up to other space adventures Ms. Moon has written? Yes. <br />  <br /> Four stars. Recommended. <br />  <br /> Barb Caffrey	2004-07-26

It's too graphic in spots, and it's way too violent, and finally, the &quot;f-word&quot; is used repeatedly in a jarring manner for no apparent reason other than to shock.<br /><br /> Ms. LeGuin is above this sort of thing; she doesn't _need_ to make her points this way, and further, it wasn't at all what I expected when I opened this collection.<br /><br /> I'm a big fan of her work; I love &quot;Lathe of Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Earthsea,&quot; and enjoyed everything else she's ever written.<br /><br /> And I suspect that if I had encountered these stories one on one, I would have liked them very much, and would have considered them thought-provoking and interesting (and probably wouldn't have been as put off by the graphic violence and swearing, either).<br /><br /> However, only three of these stories _work_ in this collection; the one about the kemmerhouse and the two about the folks living on O (the ones who make four-sided marriages). The other five all need expansion, in my opinion, and four of the five look like they could and should have been made into novels. The fifth, the final story (a novella, &quot;Paradises Lost&quot;), also needed at least 5,000 more words to explain various things left unfinished in the story, such as why the woman in it made the marriage she did and the like.<br /><br /> Those five stories, if I'd read them separately, might have evoked some of the same responses -- after all, I'm not _used_ to graphic violence in Ms. LeGuin's work, and I don't like the unnecessary bad language, either. But all five of 'em put together made me viscerally dislike and despise this book far more than I have disliked anything in the past ten years, mostly because there's just _too much_ going on.<br /><br /> Also, there's an odd juxtaposition of &quot;message stories&quot; going on. Simply put: I do not need to be bludgeoned about the head and shoulders to get the point, and so many &quot;message stories&quot; and stuff being _told_ to me rather than being _shown_ to me was distracting and displeasing.<br /><br /> And finally, between all the swearing (really, why did Ms. LeGuin have to use the term &quot;f***ery&quot; anyway? Why not just say &quot;male brothel?&quot; It's the same thing!) and the unnecessary uses of the term &quot;be aware&quot; in the last four stories (in one story, fine, but all the rest of 'em? Please!) which threw me right out of the reader's trance every time I saw it, I absolutely cannot recommend this work.<br /><br /> If you want to read it anyway, be aware that there is graphic violence in at least three of the stories, bad language in most of 'em, and that it is absolutely _not_ recommended for children under age 16 without parental supervision.<br /><br /> And if you're still insistent on reading it, my advice is to take these stories separately, and read 'em one at a time. Preferably one every few days to a week; that way you won't be _as_ upset when you're done reading this book.<br /><br /> Two stars.<br /><br /> Barb Caffrey	2004-07-21

I'd not have expected that, as Ms. Huff is one of my favorite writers, and is an excellent short story writer. However, this story (about a dog searching for its long-lost master; the s/f spin is that the master was lost through a worldgate) felt flat, almost as if Ms. Huff had tried too hard or something, and I would have appreciated the touches of humor Ms. Huff usually brings. Instead, this story was almost too downbeat, and even the somewhat happy ending couldn't completely save it. I felt this story (&quot;Finding Marcus&quot;) was more depressing than Jane Lindskold's, where at least I knew going in that her story would be dark fantasy. <br />  <br /> But out of sixteen stories, to have only one I considered to be a clinker isn't bad, which is why this anthology gets four solid stars and a recommended tag. <br />  <br /> Barb Caffrey <br />  <br /> P.S. I hope another anthology about dogs is planned, because as well as bringing back all the authors from this one, I'd like to see a story by Jennifer Roberson (she of the &quot;Cheysuli&quot; universe), as she'salso one of my favorites -- and the only one I expected to see here that I didn't!	2004-07-20

Bush. <br />  <br /> When reading political nonfiction, the one thing a person needs to remember that he or she often forgets is to take things in context. Senator Byrd has skeletons in his closet, yes, and those can easily be brought up. In that context, Senator Byrd writing this account is courageous; it might not be wholly accurate in every respect, but it is a factual report from _his_ perspective. <br />  <br /> Another thing that people often forget is that if you are in political opposition to any current regime/party, you have two choices; be quiet about it and hope you can somehow compromise with the party in power -- this is what most politicians do, btw -- or be very articulate about what you dislike, and hope that sheer articulateness gets across the frustration and anger you feel and forces the other party (or person, in this case) to come to the negotiating table. <br />  <br /> What Senator Byrd feels is absolute and utter frustration; that's obvious from reading even one page of this book. Political conservatives in the past and present have felt such frustration as well and have also written books. <br />  <br /> I do not see that this assessment, which Senator Byrd fully and frankly admits is his own (backed up by years of service, of course, and being fully aware of his past mistakes), is any different or more critical than many other assessments already on the market, from Bob Woodward's to Richard Clarke's. And those books have far higher &quot;user ratings&quot; than this one. <br />  <br /> I feel that's unfair and unjust. <br />  <br /> Senator Byrd is entitled to his opinion, and this book states it eloquently. That's why I give this book four stars, and recommend it to everyone (even the folks on the right who normally don't read anything of this nature) in order to explain why some folks are highly upset with the President. <br />  <br /> Barb Caffrey	2004-07-20
US	32010417	RQ8O0BC24EMCX	0756401739	960925903	The Magic Shop	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent anthology	&quot;The Magic Shop&quot; is one of the few anthologies I've read lately that has been entirely fulfilling. Denise Little, who edited this, did a superb job in finding seventeen writers to write about characters and their various experiences in various magic shops. <br />  <br /> All seventeen stories were good, but the best three in my mind were these. First, Michelle West's &quot;Dime Store Rings&quot; was absolutely mind-blowing, partly because I don't like most of her writing and did like this, and partly because she managed to write a very sad story without undue pathos. Second, Rosemary Edghill's &quot;A Winter's Tale&quot; was another excellent Bast story; it's a story within a story, and the last few lines absolutely cause chills. Rosemary Edghill's short stories are always thought provoking, and almost always absolutely astonishing, and this one met or exceeded expectations. More Bast stories, please! And finally, India Edghill (yes, India and Rosemary are related) wrote a powerful story about Anastasia, the &quot;lost princess&quot; of Russia, and one which envisioned a happier and more positive future for her than she probably got (as no one knows for sure). India Edghill mostly writes historicals, and does a fabulous job with them; this story definitely reflects her skill and ability as a writer. <br />  <br /> I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone over the age of about 14 (as some of the images in various stories are perhaps a bit graphic) or anyone over about 10 with parental or guardian supervision. <br />  <br /> Five stars, highly recommended. <br />  <br /> Barb Caffrey	2004-07-20

Benito Valdosta (the mischievous brother in \\"Shadow\\"), who keeps finding new ways to get himself in trouble, was jilted by his love, Maria, who married another at the end of the last book.  Consequently, the first thing he does in this book is engage in some rather public coitus to try to forget her (or at least have a good time in the process) and manages to get banished from Venice, unfortunately being sent to where Maria and her new husband have landed -- the island of Corfu.<br />There, the cruel Emeric of Hungary (egged on by his great-great-aunt, Elizabeth Bartholdy, who's even worse than Emeric) has plans to take over the island; he wants to take over Corfu as a military staging point, and expends many men and much effort into that purpose.  And he nearly succeeds in doing so.<br />But Corfu itself resists him; the island is magical, and that slows Emeric's advance down long enough for word to be sent to Venice.  Benito, of course, is the only messenger who has the street smarts and the upper class credentials to be believed, so despite his banishment, he goes anyway.<br />And after Benito returns, the sparks really start to fly, because y'see, Emeric didn't reckon on Benito, Maria and their friends . . . . <br />How Benito, Maria and the others thwart Emeric, along the way figuring out the mystery of Corfu and finding a way for Benito and Maria to reunite, is way too much fun for me to spoil.<br />Just go buy the book already, will you?<br />Five stars.  Highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />P.S. I hope there's another sequel planned; this world is way too rich and meatyto leave after only two books.	2004-07-20

When I saw this book in the bookstore way back when it was originally published, I passed because it was dealing with the Bajorans, and at the time, I just didn't care about that.<br />However, after watching all seven seasons of DS9 and getting a better flavor for the Bajorans (and gaining more interest in them), I tried this novel, and was very pleasantly surprised.  Ms. Friesner obviously &quot;got&quot; the Bajorans far sooner than I did, and wrote an excellent novel that combines elements of faith, philosophy and morality (along with the SFDS9 mythos) with adventure and gets more than the sum of its parts.<br />The quick synopsis here is, the Bajorans are in trouble (this book is between seasons one and two) due to how much the Cardassians nearly ruined Bajor before they were driven off.  The Cardassians basically raped the world, and many of the people who've returned to Bajor from the refugee camps (or who never left) are tired, hungry, footsore and shellshocked.<br />They need a sign that things will improve, and the Provisional Government isn't giving them one.<br />Into this mix comes a message from the missing Kai Opaka -- one she wrote long years before -- about a child being the key to uniting Bajor again.  Someone has to go after the child, but of course no one knows who she is (they do know the child needed is female), and the various religious factions are already fighting over the privilege of finding her (and some don't want the child found, too, making everything worse).  Which is why a Bajoran monk goes to Commander Sisko and asks for help . . . . <br />Does he get the help?  Of course, but it doesn't go quite as expected (if you're a fan of DS9, you're probably used to that by now) and there's lots of interested byplay between the various children and the officers, aswell as some fun scenes between Jake, Nog and one of the Bajoran kids, Cedra.  Ms. Friesner also managed to cram in a very credible, though understated, romance for Julian Bashir, not an easy task.<br />So, it's a coming of age story for Bashir, an adventure story, a mystery, and a race against time.  Very good work.<br />Four stars, recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />P.S. If you like this, you may enjoy Sandy Schofield's &quot;The Big Game&quot; and/or Daffyd ab Hugh's &quot;Fallen Heroes,&quot; both also excellent stories.	2004-07-20
US	32010417	R345M2NO7XSGC4	0380795302	622827907	Green Bay Replay	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Not just for Packer fans	&quot;Green Bay Replay&quot; is one of the best sports books I've ever read. The late Dick Schaap was a master sportswriter, someone who could tell a story lyrically and powerfully, and was also a longtime fan of the Green Bay Packers. Both were needed, because one without the other wouldn't have written this powerful, funny book, one of the best modern football books ever.<br />I've read many, many books about sports. Baseball, football, basketball . . . and most have been tolerable. Some have been excellent. This book is superlative, mostly because it (like Schaap did) has a heart about the issues that have changed the NFL since the 1960s (the time of original Super Bowl I winning Green Bay team) and points out how many of these changes, for good and ill, have affected one team -- Green Bay.<br />Because Green Bay is the only publicly owned team in America and has an unusual leadership setup in that there's not even a figurehead owner, the relationship with the fans, city and team is closer, warmer and more special than in any other city. Other cities have great fans, yes -- many of them do. But other cities don't live and die with their team, year in and year out, as do the Green Bay fans.<br />This fan, who suffered through many 3-13 and 4-12 seasons on the way back to first respectability, then a Super Bowl Win, then playoff contention and near-Super Bowl misses, enjoys re-reading this book now and again because it contains what many sports books of the present lack -- optimism.<br />As well, it's a faithful look at the Packer teams of the 60s and the 90s, warts and all; granted, some of the scandals that came out after this book was published (i.e., Antonio Freeman's car accident with or without DUI -- he got out of the car and no one's sure who was driving at the time -- and Eugene Robinson's trip to the strip club after moving to the next team happened after this book was printed in paperback) are not covered, but was Schaap supposed to be omniscient, too?<br />If you like Brett Favre, Reggie White, Jerry Kramer or Ray Nitschke (among others), this book is for you. If you're a Packer fan, this book is for you. And if you're a football fan, demoralized from star after so-called star refusing to sign autographs, swearing in front of kids and microphones, and other such behavior (and it goes downhill from there, let me assure you), this book is for you.<br />Five stars. Highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-07-15

Jethri has learned a few words of the Liaden language, and wants to learn more, but is hampered in his attempts by his mother (who wants no part of Jethri _or_ the Liadens).  His father is dead, and most of his close kin don't seem to know what to make of him.<br />Be that as it may, after his first solo trade, he &quot;invests&quot; in a scheme that turns out to be shady; as it involves a Liaden Master Trader, he goes to her and asks what's going on.  But she knows nothing.  However, because Jethri did warn them, and because she knew he was being honorable, she takes an interest in him.<br />Because of this, and because his mother wants no part of him and will be happier once he's gone elsewhere, Jethri goes to the Liadens and becomes first an apprentice Trader under the kindly Liaden woman, then her foster son.  Along the way, Jethri learns more about himself, the Liaden people, and what his talents are best suited for than he ever dreamed possible, and the Liadens -- the Traders, at least -- learn they still have something in common with their close cousins, the humans.<br />I don't want to spoil it, so I'll stop there.<br />The only drawbacks to this book -- and they are minor -- are that there are a lot of loose ends left at the end of the book (from the disposition of minor characters to what happens to the Old Tech Jethri and the others found along the way), and that a sequel to this book doesn't seem to be immediately forthcoming.<br />No matter.  For characterization, plot, and meaty story like this, I'll wait.<br />Five stars.  Highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-07-09
US	32010417	R2C3WXMG4DISPK	0345461983	38213846	Dragon's Kin	Books	3	18	20	N	N	Good coming of age tale, but not great	\\"Dragon's Kin,\\" while not up to the standard of most of the earlier Pern novels, is far better than the last bunch about F'lessan.<br />The basic plot is as follows.   Kindan wants to be a Harper, and has vocal and musical talent.  He's about eleven or twelve when the book opens, and is kind of at loose ends; his favorite sister is marrying, his brothers are distant, and as the youngest of nine children, his father seems rather remote.  Kindan does have a close friend, Zenor, who's a few months older, but that's about it.<br />And things are even more odd in this family than in most, because Kindan's father is bonded to a watchwher (distant cousins of both the fire lizards and the dragons), and lives different hours than most people as watchwhers are nocturnal.  At any rate, Kindan doesn't realize how different his life is than most, although his friend Zenor does (and is envious of it).<br />And because of where he lives, Kindan gets to know more about watchwhers than most people.  This might be considered an advantage by many, but not by Kindan.  His heart is elsewhere.<br />Then disaster strikes, and most of Kindan's family gets wiped out in a mining accident.  The watchwher dies helping to get the few miners who survived the accident out of the mine, and Kindan is left totally alone for the first time in his life.  He has mixed feelings about this, but for the most part, those feelings are never brought to the fore.<br />Because of this, Kindan doesn't feel totally fleshed out as a character; he's never allowed to fully grieve.  And even amidst a bunch of folks who are also grieving, I doubt Kindan -- or any child, no matter how mature -- would be as matter of fact about losing all his family.<br />Be that as it may, because Kindan is no more than twelve, he can't live alone, and he's not cut out for work in the mine.  Fortunately, everyone realizes this, and he goes to live with the Harper.  A brief idyll ensues, as Kindan enjoys helping the Harper and gets toknow Nuella, a blind girl whose been hidden from most of the folks at the minehold due to her disability.<br />Then another disaster happens in the mine, and its determined that another watchwher must be sought.  For whatever reason, the minehold of Natalon (that's the head miner) is now considered to be accursed by some (although this is never fully gone into, either), and no grown watchwher or his/her handler will go there.<br />However, if a watchwher can be raised from the egg, then they'll have some protection.  Watchwhers are good in mines; they can detect bad air faster than humans can, and as they see by infrared, they're very good at rescue as well (as was seen by the loss of the previous watchwher).<br />What does this have to do with Kindan?  Plenty, as he's the only person in the minehold -- the only one -- who knows anything at all about watchwhers.<br />(Spoiler warning below) *****<br />Basically, Kindan is forced to go find a watchwher egg despite not really knowing much about how to raise a watchwher.  Then, after he brings it home and it hatches, Nuella shows a great talent with the watchwher, but does not bond with the new fledgling, so the new watchwher (dubbed Kisk) stays with Kindan.<br />How does this all play out?  It's for you to read. (Don't want to spoil it any more than that.)<br />**** end of spoiler warning ****<br />The reason this gets three stars, rather than the four I was initially contemplating, is that the characterization (other than that of the blind Nuella) isn't as strong as most of the other Pern books.  But it is at least the equal in characterization of the latter books (starting with \\"All the Weyrs of Pern\\" and continuing outward from that year), and it reads easier than most of those.<br />But is it the equal of the earliest of the Pern books about Lessa and F'lar?  No.  Is it the equal of the earlier YA novels about Menolly, Sebell, and Piemur?  No.<br />So, although this is a good coming of age tale (and is definitelyintended for younger audiences in my opinion, although older readers also will enjoy the book), and although it reads fast and easily, it's not great.<br />And what makes it less than what it could have been lays solely along the lines of characterization.  This book doesn't make the reader look for underlying meaning.  In \\"Dragon's Kin,\\" the underlying meanings are either too plain, or too subtle; either one might have worked, but not both.<br />One final comment: I believe that Todd McCaffrey helped this book, rather than hindered.  This book has much more life than most of the last books (anything after \\"All the Weyrs of Pern\\" in sequence) except for \\"Master Harper of Pern,\\" and I think that's because of Mr. McCaffrey's contribution.  And it's because of the life and liveliness of the book that I read until the end, and (for the most part) enjoyed it.<br />Three stars.<br />(...)	2004-07-07

He deserves much credit for this, as most of the surviving documentation is either spotty or nonexistent.<br />Second, as a fantasy, &quot;Mother of Kings&quot; doesn't read well.<br />How can Mr. Anderson have done both?  Simple.  Gunnhild, the titular &quot;Mother of Kings,&quot; is not a nice person.  She meets her husband young, and vows to marry him because he is handsome.  This sometimes happens, and it's about the only thing that led me, the reader, into believing that Gunnhild might be worth something.  But after Gunnhild gets to the throne by marriage, other than loving her husband and birthing many babies, she does a variety of things that aren't so nice.  This is mostly because she wants her own way, and because she's highborn and married well, she gets it.  And that means if she has to kill her magic teachers, she does it without a qualm -- and without any regrets.  If she feels she has to kill to save her husband or children, ditto, even if the person/people in question have done nothing to upset, anger or threaten her or her family.<br />I'm sorry, but I just can't warm to a character who acts this way.  And I'm unsure Gunnhild really was this bloodthirsty; she may have been a pawn, or she may have been as strong as Mr. Anderson paints her -- but not so unthinking or uncaring.<br />Getting back to this story, the other big problem with it is that Gunnhild's offspring are mostly not likable, either.  The only likable one in the lot is Gunnhild's daughter, who Gunnhild inexplicably marries off to the most odious man she knows.  Granted, it's to form and forge a contract between her family in exile and the rulers of the place they get stranded at, but still -- if she loved her daughter, why do that to her?  Especially if Gunnhild is supposedto be so powerful of a shaman?<br />And the shamanic magic isn't really gone into; Gunnhild uses it some of the time, but most of the time she leaves it alone.  The reasons for this are spotty.  And later, the fact that her sons have turned to Christianity keeps her from her magic as well.<br />Basically, the historical elements (who did what to whom when, and why) are all there, and are masterful.  But Gunnhild is cold, and her children (with the sole exception of her daughter) are worse.  Her husband, Eirik Blood-Ax, is a cipher, and most of the other folks she knew or grew up with end up dead.  Granted, this is probably accurate for the time frame, but it does nothing to further Gunnhild's character.<br />And because I disliked Gunnhild very much (when I was expecting to like her), I could not like this book.  Admire it, yes.  But like it?  No.<br />Mr. Anderson wrote three far better historical books in the &quot;Last Viking&quot; trilogy about Harold Hardrede, and I recommend them, but not this.<br />Three stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-07-07
US	32010417	R1SS9RTKJ6NJHB	0671721860	387107544	Three Hearts and Three Lions	Books	3	8	15	N	N	Quick, readable fantasy	\\"Three Hearts and Three Lions\\" is a good book, but it's not great.  It was groundbreaking in its time (the 1950s) but now appears dated and rushed, mostly because this book was originally written as a serial for magazines.<br />Knowing that, it's easier to comprehend the less-than-fully-fleshed-out characterizations.  Holger Carlson, our man out of time (he's from the 20th century and is adrift in a new, fantastic world filled with \\"swan-mays\\" and witches and elves), is a cipher at the beginning, and is almost as much of one at the end.  He wants to do good, and does it -- but is hampered by lack of faith, and is sometimes helped by greater knowledge of engineering, chemistry and especially physics.<br />All of this is realistic, interesting, and well worth your time to read.<br />Where this book falls flat, in my opinion, is in the realm of characterization.  Granted, this was the 1950s, so Alianora the swan-may's fluffy characterization was about the best most authors would manage.  However, Mr. Anderson had already written about a strong woman in \\"Brainwave\\" if I recall correctly; he knew how to get strong women across in the marketplace, and moreover, he knew how to write romance.<br />This is not romance by any stretch of the imagination, although there's a fair amount of sex (along with a goodly amount of violence).  Unlike much literature of the 1950s, Mr. Anderson makes Holger question his morality and judgement; this, in my opinion, is the one really good bit of characterization Holger has, and is the only reason he is likable.<br />The good points about \\"Three Hearts and Three Lions:\\"  It's quick.  It's interesting.  It is realistic.  And there are spots of humor.<br />The bad points?  There isn't much characterization or romance.  Alianora the swan-may is rather trite and boring, and most of the other minor characters are no better.  And there isn't much explanation of why everyone recognizes Holger, but why Holger doesn't recognize them.<br />Still.  It's readable, interesting, and has its good points.  And it was groundbreaking in the genre.<br />Better reads by Mr. Anderson include the massive \\"King of Ys\\" saga, the Dominic Flandry series, the \\"Last Viking\\" trilogy about Harold Hardrede, and \\"Brainwave.\\"<br />Compared to those others, this is a three star novel, and that's how I'm rating it.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-07-07

After all, Philip Lynx (aka Flinx) is an interesting character, smart, empathic, a mild telepath, and bonded to an Alaspinian mini-drag (a sort of snake with wings).  And Flinx has had many other adventures, most of which have been entertaining, and some of which have been exhilirating.<br />However, most of the exhilirating adventures (&quot;The Tar-Aiym Krang,&quot; &quot;For Love of Mother-Not&quot;) are long behind Flinx, or, perhaps, have been put in stasis.  For what we get in &quot;Flinx's Folly&quot; is warmed over romance coupled with a couple of the wildest deus ex machina plot twists that Alan Dean Foster has ever written.<br />Granted, in previous Flinx novels, Flinx often got out of trouble with what _looked_ like a deus ex machina, only to find out later that it was due to his own abilities, previous memories that had been walled off, or friends he didn't know he had (or that still lived).  But in this book, Flinx gets out of trouble three times -- and all three are via deus ex machina of various types, and in only one case is the deus ex machina explained!<br />And although there are some humorous moments, and a bit of romance, it's not enough to leaven the mix in my opinion.<br />Which is why I'm giving &quot;Flinx's Folly&quot; 2 1/2 stars on the head.  I think it's dead average; the writing is good, the pacing brisk, but really, there's nothing new here nor was there any reason to write this book except to further the series.  Let's hope the next book will be the conclusion, so poor Flinx can finally find a nice woman to settle down with (whether it's Clarity Held or not) and get on with life.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-07-07
US	32010417	R2JCF5ELG77QM9	076531035X	92849089	The Dragon Quintet	Books	3	14	16	N	N	Interesting, but flawed, anthology	&quot;Dragon Quintet&quot; is an odd mix of stories only slightly linked by one thing: all feature a dragon, or at least a dragon-like, creature, and most of these stories are dark to out and out black-spirited.<br />The sole uplifting story of the lot, &quot;Joust&quot; by Mercedes Lackey, is good, interesting, and very representative of Ms. Lackey's style.  However, I'd already read the novel version of &quot;Joust,&quot; which oddly beat this collection to the press by at least a year.  Four stars for that.<br />The next best story was by Elizabeth Moon, and is in her &quot;Paksenarrion&quot; universe but does not feature paladins or elves.  Instead, this features dwarves, a dragon, and two very put upon villagers.  I liked the villagers very much, and appreciated a return to this universe, one of my all-time favorites.  Still, it's a rather dark tale, and I'd rather have had a happier ending.  Three and a half stars.<br />The third best story was by Michael Swanwick.  I liked the story up until the end, where Mr. Swanwick basically ruined it by tossing off a fable-type ending that didn't make a goodly amount of sense.  In addition, this story only had two likable characters in it, and both were more or less abused throughout the story, something I really did not care for.  Granted, this is dark fantasy, and Mr. Swanwick definitely made me hate all his hatable characters.  But I'd have liked to have love his likable ones, and I didn't.  Three stars.<br />The remaining stories seemed, to me at least, to be incomplete.  Orson Scott Card's story was a sort of urban fantasy about a resident dragon and a boy, and as far as it went, up until the end, I liked it. But once again, a lousy ending ruined it.  In addition, the information given by the editor led me to believe that Mr. Card is planning to turn this story into a novel.  I really hope that doesn't happen, as this has to be the most downbeat story I've ever read by Mr. Card (not even excepting the last book about Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin), and that's not what I've grown to expect from him.  Two stars for that.<br />And Tanith Lee's story, while engrossing and having some truly unseen plot-twists, didn't totally make sense, either.  I enjoyed the basic &quot;women done wrong gets revenge&quot; plotline, but the story was either too long or too short; too long in that it makes little sense in this form (even considering Ms. Lee's normal elliptical plotlines and fairytale-esque endings, dark or bright), too short in that in a novel, it might have worked well.  Two stars, barely.<br />And that's basically it; it's an interesting experiment, but it's flawed, and if you don't like dark fantasy or aren't in the mood for it, don't get this book.  It's not advertised as dark fantasy, but in my opinion, that's exactly what it is (with the sole exception of Ms. Lackey's stripped-down version of &quot;Joust&quot;).<br />Three stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-07-01

And Phule's father (I can't remember his name) is just not a funny character; he's shallow, vain, narcissistic, and doesn't have enough &quot;oomph,&quot; somehow.<br />Plus, instead of coming up with a brand new plotline, or a brand new planet to play on/with, Mr. Asprin and Mr. Heck decided to set half the book at the casino (book two), bringing back two quasi-villains who now want to go straight (book four), and then have the typical problems with Phule's company of irregulars on the last planet of call (book four).  Mixing the plots of books two and four makes for a fun, yet very shallow read; it's like rewarmed macaroni and cheese.  Once is good, twice is OK, but after that, throw it out.<br />And although we're not to the throwing out stage just yet, I highly advise Mr. Asprin and Mr. Heck to come up with a different scene or some different characters for the next book, if indeed there is to be another one.<br />Three stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-06-19
US	32010417	RQB7VA4IRERCX	0743435923	541218661	Pyramid Scheme	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Insanely funny, well researched book . . .	. . . and did I mention that it's hilarious yet?<br />In \\"Pyramid Scheme,\\" the plot is mostly a MacGuffin; a pyramid has been dropped on the University of Chicago by forces unknown, and it's causing trouble -- major, big time trouble.  As in, it's killing people.  Our heroes, led by Jerry Lukacs (not sure I spelled his name right), a highly intellectual man without much personal physical strength, go to check out the pyramid, and instead get dropped into a series of adventures with real gods, real heroes -- and mostly, they find out that they'd rather be back home, thanks.<br />But they're not, so they have to fight through the adventures, and do their best to win back to our time -- and hope they've gotten back in time to stop the pyramids from causing more trouble.<br />You'd not think this is a great set up for a work of humor, and it is very unconventional -- but it does work, as throughout the rest of the book, you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  What's up with this whole pyramid bit?  Why are the heroes being constantly dropped into this situation and then into the next one?  Who's going to pair up, and why?  (Some of it is sexist, I grant, but the two authors make fun of sexism at the same time, and it is very, very funny.)<br />It's character-driven fantasy, it's historically accurate, and it's incredibly, insanely funny.<br />What more do you want?<br />Well, if you want a cohesive, logical plotline from beginning to end, you probably won't find it here.  This is a sprawling plot, instead, which works to play up the humor and lighten up the violence.  Because really, without the humor, this story would be unrelentingly grim; instead, we get a satirical, riotously funny view of what would happen if some people from today's world got transported into the past (and different milieus of same) and then interacted with heroes and gods.<br />What I like best about this book is that the authors, Eric Flint and Dave Freer, did a great job writing an intensely hilarious, laugh out loud book.  If you're an intellectual, or if you like the Greek myths, or even if you just like low comedy, this book is for you.<br />Four stars, recommended.(...)	2004-06-08

Instead, it was Sheth who had conceived of the idea (Seagryn's contribution was due to another individual, a tugolith -- a sort of elephant-like animal with rudimentary intelligence and speech -- sacrificing herself for him, as he was intended to be the other sacrifice as his altershape was/is a tugolith), but instead of catching the blame, Seagryn is wrongly accused.<br />This accusation has some basis in fact, mainly because Seagryn is probably the only person who can stop the dragon from feeding on people due to the unusual bond he has with one of the two souls that makes up that dragon.  (In the forging, the two tugoliths lost their old identities, but the souls are still distinct.  Basically, one of the dragon-heads hates humans and wants to do them dirt, while the other just wants to talk with the humans and get to know them as people.  The second head is the good soul who sacrificed for Seagryn; the problem is, she, too, will eat humans as her preferred dish basically due to the other soul's influence.)  He can sometimes stop them from feeding, and attempts to do so after the dragon attacks his village.  He's seen trying to stop them, but that's misinterpreted.<br />The comedy of errors continues throughout the book, but it's interwoven with far more dire elements.  In addition to the dragon, the remnants of the One Land have fallen under the sway of rogue traders, and the economy everywhere is miserable.  (Bad enough to have a dragon randomly feeding, when the rest of the time you can't make a go of it anyway.)  And many people are out to get Seagryn, including some of his erstwhile friends, and Seagryn's new wife isn't really safe, either . .. . <br />This is a very entertaining story on one hand, and a very moral tale on the other.  Seagryn attempts to right wrongs that he didn't create, mainly because he can see that they need to be righted by someone -- and he's the best candidate for the job.<br />In addition, the minor characters (including Dark the Prophet and Paumer the former head of the trading combine/Conspiracy) have much more weight and heft than in Hughes' earlier trilogy about Pelmen the Powershaper.<br />I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys moral and ethical fantasy.<br />Five stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-06-04

Pelmen the Powershaper (sometime rogue, sometime actor, always a priest), who defeated the nasty two-headed dragon Vicia-Heinox earlier in this series, now must gather together his allies and defeat some nasty other powershapers (or at least slow them down) while attempting to return some of the power that's been misused over time to the creator.  (The parallels with Christianity are intended.)<br />The problem is, Pelmen has just found the love of his life, Serphimera, former High Priestess of the Dragonfaith (those who willingly went to be eaten by the two-headed dragon), and he doesn't want to give her up.  Yet giving the Power back may involve more sacrifice than he wishes . . . and she's not happy.<br />Basically, the book is fine when it focuses on the two of them, or on people who are interacting with them.  It's when the book goes away from these two and focuses on lesser lights that the book loses much of its focus.  (In constrast, the two later books -- which are actually prequels to this whole trilogy -- feature lesser characters that are just as weighty as the mains.  I believe this is because Hughes gained more finesse and ability as a writer, not because the world he envisioned was or wasn't more interesting.)<br />That's why that, as much as I enjoyed this series (and I really did), I can't really give the climactic book any more than a three star review.<br />But I would recommend the series as a whole, and highly recommend the two prequels, \\"The Faithful Traitor\\" and \\"The Forging of the Dragon.\\"<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-06-04

Fitzroy is a very engaging character, and while the book stays with him (and the Seleighe elves protecting him), I enjoyed it immensely.<br />However, about 2/3 of the way through, the story shifts more to protecting Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I).  Because of this, we don't see Henry's marriage, we don't see much of his life after he hits age 13 (the then-age of maturity!), and we don't really see why he likes Elizabeth so much.  The best the authors came up with was that Fitzroy didn't know, either, but since he did, he was going to do his best for her.<br />This is quite plausible, considering Fitzroy was around age 17 when he died; how many 17 year old boys are close to their sisters?  And if they are, how many of them know why?<br />Still, it's a fairly weak thread to weave your plot over; it worked, because the authors are both fine writers, but I would rather have seen this book go another fifty to one hundred pages and see Fitzroy's marriage, maybe see him yearning for his own kids (and that might be why he took to Elizabeth, who was portrayed as not only very smart but very loving as a youngster?), and have the plot fully fleshed out.<br />As it stands, 2/3 of this book is exemplary, but then it falls off to a very rushed ending that wasn't very satisfying.<br />Be that as it may, THIS SCEPTR'D ISLE is an entertaining prequel to Ms. Lackey's &quot;Bedlam's Bard&quot; and &quot;Serrated Edge&quot; novels, and I especially enjoyed the portrayal of the two sets of half-sibling twins, Rhoslyn and Pasgen (raised by the Unseleighe, or Dark, Elves) and Denorieland Aleneil (raised by the Seleighe, or Bright, Elves).<br />A shade under four stars, recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-04-20

For one, instead of a coming of age tale, we have a &quot;how am I supposed to fit in?&quot; tale instead.  And the minions of evil are more earthly, and evil; in short, they're drug lords, sane, in control of themselves -- and all the more vile for that.<br />But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.<br />Protagonist Eric Banyon, flutist and Bard, has returned to the World Above to resume his collegiate career at Juilliard.  His former lovers, Beth and Korendil the Elf (Kory for short), have definitely paired off, and he's somewhat at loose ends.<br />But not for long.<br />He returns to school, meets a gargoyle named Greystone, and becomes friends with him.  And through Greystone, he meets the four Watchers living in his apartment building; four individuals pledged to right wrongs other people don't see, mainly because they have the power to do so and the willingness to lay it all on the line for what they believe is right.<br />At any rate, Eric finds that evil is stalking the poorest and lowest of the citizens of New York -- people no one else seems to care about.  Even Ria Llewelyn, erstwhile love interest (and recently healed corporate half-Elven shark), doesn't seem to care about what's happening.<br />But Eric cares, and he can't just let it lie.  He has to do something.<br />But what?<br />What he does, and how he does it, I'll leave you to find out.  But I will say that I found it a wonderful adventure with unusual depth and breadth, and it set up SPIRITS WHITE AS LIGHTNING quite nicely in the process.<br />I like this story better because it's based on self sufficiency; simply put, a big part of the story is Eric learning to accept himself and his magic.  That's a message that you just don't see much in fiction; most male heroes are Hell-bent on finding a female (or, in some cases, male) lover just as soon as possible, to block out the dreadful loneliness.<br />In other words, self-actualization isa non-starter ninety-nine percent of the time.<br />But not here.  Despite his initial feelings of loneliness, Eric learns to see his life as interesting and challenging instead.  And that attitude makes this book more realistic, not less, because it's what a mature man would be more likely to do (I mean, let's face it, 28 year old men just don't moon over girls all day and all night if they're even halfway normal).  And his growing acceptance of himself and his craft allowed me as a reader to enjoy the atmosphere of a pre-9/11 New York City and be swept away by the highlights (and lowlights) of living there.<br />It's something I never thought I'd see happen, much less convincingly, but Ms. Lackey and Ms. Edghill really pulled it off well.<br />The only drawback (and it's minor) in this work is that there is a lot of room, years even, between SUMMONED TO TOURNEY and BEYOND WORLD'S END.  Why the marked demarcation?<br />Granted, the changes made (Eric's growing maturity, Beth and Kory being only friends now) made sense to me, mainly because I've never seen a stable threesome in my entire life.<br />But I'd love to see what happened in between there; maybe one of these days, Ms. Edghill or Ms. Lackey (or both) will write a story about that time period, to better explain what, exactly, put these three back on the road to friendship (rather than love)?<br />Ms. Lackey had written several tales with Elves in them before, notably SUMMONED TO TOURNEY and KNIGHT OF GHOSTS AND SHADOWS (which also featured Eric Banyon, flutist-for-hire).  Ms. Edghill had written three books in her Twelve Treasures series, which featured a group of friends in their mid-twenties and their adventures with Elves.<br />It was an inspired pairing, as the two authors have now combined on three books (this one, SPIRITS WHITE AS LIGHTNING, and MAD MAUDLIN, with MUSIC TO MY SORROW forthcoming) and brought Eric Banyon's character further along the road to maturity without losing any freshness or appeal.<br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />And if you like this book (and I hope you do), go read the other books in this series, along with anything else Ms. Edghill has ever written.	2004-04-20

It's a historical epic fantasy with many settings, many characters, and many interwoven plots, but it never, ever falters.<br />SHADOW OF THE LION is mostly the story of Marco and Benito, two brothers who go from rags to riches amidst war, intrigue, magic, and more war in 16th century Venice.  In this alternate history, because magic works, the alliances among countries and kings aren't always what you'd expect.<br />At any rate, Marco and Benito are engaging characters, and I enjoyed reading about their adventures.  I don't want to go into too much detail about these adventures, either; suffice it to say that who they meet, what they find out, and what they do along the way with that information is too much fun for me to spoil.<br />Go read this impressive book for yourself already!<br />Five stars plus, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-04-20

EXILE'S VALOR is impossible for me to rate outright, as there are several continuity errors that cause problems in the Heralds of Valdemar series.<br />But as a stand-alone book, or as a sequel to the superlative EXILE'S HONOR, it's quite good.<br />Which makes it tough to review, but I'll give it my best.<br />In EXILE'S HONOR, Alberich of Karse finds a new home, a new job, and many new friends.  He also finds out most of what he thought he knew about Valdemar was dead wrong; the Companions are not demons (as the priests of Karse had said), the people of Valdemar are much like his own people of Karse (which also certainly wasn't what the priests believed).<br />And EXILE'S VALOR continues to show Alberich as he gets more settled with his new job, his new home, and his new friends.  Along the way, he tries to help the young Queen Selenay cement her rule, and helps to train many young people in the art of war -- praying the whole time that they'll never be needed.<br />Alberich, his Companion Kantor, his lover Myste (whether she's based on Ms. Lackey or not), and the other Heralds, Bards and people-at-large are real, vivid and extremely interesting to read about.<br />But then, there's the downward side, which is that this is a book that has an already well-established backstory, and EXILE'S VALOR doesn't seem to adhere to that backstory as well as one might wish.  In addition, I don't understand how the mixup from the Bardic trainee to the Heraldic trainee (and then not being certain afterward, either) could have happened; this should have been caught by someone in editing.<br />The story -- if taken alone, or in sequence only with EXILE'S HONOR -- would be a four star story; very good, and recommended.  As it stands, I still recommend the book for the writing, the believability of the characters, and the intricate weave-through of plots.<br />But I feel I can only give it three stars (and at that, I'm rounding up considerably because of my respect for the writing and the writer) because there are just too many continuity errors with stories written far earlier (especially the &quot;Arrows&quot; trilogy and the stand-alone &quot;By the Sword&quot;).<br />The bottom line here is, do you want the quality of the writing, or do you want the continuity?  If you get very upset by continuity errors, skip this book for now; if you don't care much about continuity errors (after all, MZB made quite a few, and told people who complained to just live with it), get it now.  The writing is exemplary, and Alberich is a great character.<br />But it's really too bad we can't have both things, as in other, earlier, books, Ms. Lackey has been able to remember her own backstory.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-04-20

What would happen if Jesus, Martin Luther King, Junior, Mohandas Ghandi, and other historical peacemakers had instead picked up the sword and fought back?<br />My favorite story in this collection, bar none, was Mercedes Lackey's \\"Jihad.\\"  In this alternate-universe story, T.E. Lawrence turns his back on his own country and Westernism as a whole, and instead unites the Middle East.  Great story, well told, and it made sense.  Five stars plus for that.<br />My second favorite story was Judith Tarr's \\"Queen of Asia.\\"  This twists known-history nicely, and brings Alexander to Asia as bridegroom, not conqueror.  Four and a half stars for that.<br />My third favorite story was Jack C. Haldeman II's \\"Death of a Dream.\\"  This story turns on King's \\"I have a dream speech,\\" and asks the question, \\"What if he hadn't made it?\\"<br />The bloody aftermath of that not happening made a great deal of logical sense.  In addition, the choice of President after JFK died was an interesting one; Richard Daley (the first; mayor of Chicago during the 1968 riots at the Democratic National Convention).  And King alludes to a certain Georgia governor, put on the ticket to placate moderates; Haldeman is surely alluding to Jimmy Carter, who I can well believe would have done something had he found himself in the horrible situation Haldeman describes.  Four solid stars for that.<br />I also really enjoyed Lea Hernandez' story \\"Al Einstein -- Nazi Smasher!\\"  It was a great deal of fun to read; couldn't take it seriously, but enjoyed it all the same.<br />Some of the other stories were good, some were blah.  One didn't make much sense; maybe it needed more space?<br />I refer to the Jane Austen story by Esther Friesner.  I really like her conception of the history (in her take, Napoleon is alive and has conquered England, with the United States allying with France due to France's help in the American Revolutionary War).  I enjoyed her view of Jane Austen -- she lives and breathes.  And I can handle her unusual romances between Jane and Davy Crockett and Jane's sister falling in love with a French Lieutenant.<br />I just can't buy that Jane would be allowed to go on Napoleon's ship.  No matter what happened after that; it just took me right out of the reader's trance.<br />The story succeeds on many levels; best I can do is refuse to rate this story, or rate it on its potential.  Potential: five stars plus.  But it's too short and needed more time.  Another ten pages would have helped this story develop and grow nicely.<br />I want to see more in this world; the story whetted my appetite for an alternate history with Jane Austen in it, and I really enjoy Ms. Friesner's writing.<br />But this story was too short.  Two and a half for it, wishing I could give it more.<br />Most of the rest of the stories were marginal to good, but didn't really make much of an impression.<br />So, the final tally is three and a half stars, recommended, mostly so you can read Ms. Lackey's incredibly realistic story about T.E. Lawrence.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-04-15
US	32010417	R2OSL2V9R24RX1	0451211111	577171295	Irresistible Forces	Books	3	92	98	N	N	Uneven, but worth reading	IRRESISTIBLE FORCES is a collection of six stories from s/f and romance heavy hitters.  The best story of the lot, \\"Winterfair Gifts,\\" is by Lois McMaster Bujold, and features two minor characters from her Vorkosigan novels exploring a most unusual romance amidst a backdrop of mystery and intrigue.<br />Only caveat: I'm unsure if someone who hasn't read much of Ms. Bujold's Vorkoverse would understand this story.  Since I've read every single book Ms. Bujold has ever put out, I cannot answer that question.<br />But I enjoyed it very much, and thought it well worth the price of the entire book.  (I bought this collection solely for that story, and looked at the other stories as an \\"added bonus.\\")<br />Five stars, and I'd give it more if I had 'em. :)<br />After that, the stories get tougher to rate.  I liked Catherine Asaro's story, \\"Stained Glass Heart,\\" much more than I thought I would; it appears to be an outtake from her Skolian universe series, and has two young, apparently doomed lovers, a highly stratified society, and an arranged marriage.  Love, family, duty, honor, and \\"keeping up appearances\\" are all themes in this story, and all worked.<br />The biggest problem with this story is that the protagonists are very young -- the older of the two is seventeen -- and the two youngsters are dealing with some very adult subjects.  Nothing wrong with that, exactly, just a bit offputting considering that every other story in this collection deals with clear-cut adults -- most protagonists are at least twenty-five or so.<br />The plot is one we've seen before, with a few twists (I don't want to spoil 'em, so I won't go into 'em here).  However, it's done well here, the science fictional bits are well chosen, and if it's representative of the Skolian universe as a whole, I might have to give Ms. Asaro's work another try.<br />I think this is the best story I've read from Ms. Asaro, and I'd give it three and a half stars, even though I still don't understand the meaningof this story's title (except for the obvious).<br />I enjoyed Jo Beverley's story (I forget the title) that juxtaposed Winston Churchill, the far future, and what happens when heroes return to their homes -- but it took a long, long time to develop and the language used was rather clunky and got in the way of the story.  (As far as I know, this is Ms. Beverley's first-ever attempt at a science fiction/fantasy story; it does work.  But I think it would have worked better as a novel.)<br />Because the idea was so very strong and because I could see where Ms. Beverley was going with her story, I'd give her story three and a half stars.<br />\\"The Alchemical Marriage\\" by Mary Jo Putney was a decent story; it didn't really move me or engage me, but it wasn't a bad effort, exactly.  I think the whole subject of how the Spanish Armada was deflected was too big for one short story; perhaps this would have been better suited as a novel subject?<br />And the lovers got together far, far too quickly for my taste.<br />Still, not bad, exactly.  Just not right on the money.<br />Two stars for that one.<br />\\"Shadows in the Wood,\\" by Jennifer Roberson, is another really tough one to rate.  I like Ms. Roberson's writing -- I like it a whole lot.  I also like the subject matter, how Ms. Roberson plays it out, and what happens in the story -- but once again, the story seems just way, way too short and truncated.<br />I mean, Maid Marian and Robin Hood meet Merlin?  In a very short story?  At the very end of the book?<br />Why was this story given such short shrift?<br />At any rate, I wish this story had been much longer.  It was so enjoyable, I wanted a whole lot more.<br />So, I'd give the idea of the story four stars, and the writing five stars, but the fact that there wasn't enough room for the idea (and not enough room to develop it either) two.  I guess I'll give it overall three stars, mainly because I do like the writer and the writing so much.<br />Finally, we come to DebStover and her good, but misplaced story \\"Skin Deep.\\"  This is a paranormal romance; it's a good paranormal, albeit very short, and I liked the characters.<br />But alongside three science fiction stories and two fantasies, it doesn't work.  It just doesn't.  Even if you count the Putney story as historical fantasy, it still doesn't work.<br />I think Ms. Stover's writing is good, and her storytelling is very interesting.  She made me laugh more than any other author except for Ms. Bujold (whose writing I know very well from past experience; this was the first exposure I'd ever had to Ms. Stover).  I liked her story.<br />But it had no place here.  It threw off the tone of the anthology.  And it threw the other stories even further off balance (and the anthology was already rather uneven to begin with).<br />Because of this story, I took off one star from the overall anthology rating (because of Ms. Bujold's very strong story, I'd normally have wished to give this anthology four stars, rounding the overall stars upward rather than down as I did here) -- but I'd still recommend this particular story to paranormal romance readers.<br />I know that has to sound odd; in effect, I'd give the story itself a four star rating, but separate it from the other five stories, because it just does not fit.<br />In conclusion, this is an uneven effort, but worth reading despite the unevenness.<br />Three stars, recommended for people who want to branch out from romance to s/f or vice versa.<br />One final note: I wish this anthology hadn't been so long delayed.  It was originally set to go in 2003 and was held until 2004, supposedly to make a \\"big splash\\" at Valentine's Day of this year, in order to perhaps generate bigger sales.  All I know is that the so-called \\"big splash\\" didn't happen in my neck of the woods at all, and that I had a hard time finding it in the local bookstore.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-04-07
US	32010417	R3H5OZYET5EWZL	031206974X	833989324	Fleeting Fancy	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Fun screwball comedy	&quot;Fleeting Fancy&quot; is a fine example of a Regency screwball comedy.  It's not a true romance in the normal sense at all, as titular heroine Primula Greetwell had been abandoned by her short-term husband, Lord Severn, a few weeks after the wedding nine years before.  Severn tricked her; she wasn't really married at all.<br />When his father, the Earl of Malhythe, finds out, he exiles Severn to India, hoping that will civilize him, or that the Indian people will rid him of the problem.<br />Flash forward nine years.  Primula is now 25, Severn is in his mid-30s, and he wants to come home.  So, his father the Earl says to him that he'll allow it if he just married the person his father wants him to marry sight unseen.<br />And he does, like an obedient (idiot) son.  And then, because the Earl is still mad at him, he's instructed Primula not to talk about the past and to pretend she's never seen him before, and he's told his son to make her happy, or else.<br />Now, anyone reading this summation might be asking, &quot;So, Barb, why do you like this book?  Not much plot here.&quot;  Well, it's a screwball comedy!  It reminded me of a Regency as done by Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn when they were feeling particularly cranky, and with lots of the witty byplay that characterized those actors.<br />The subplots are interesting, but incomplete.  The first one deals with the courtesan Aspasia, who is the Earl's mistress.  She appears to be almost forty, so she can't marry the Earl; it's just &quot;Not Done&quot; in the Regency period.  But she can love him and be with him discreetly, and so she is.  She's a high class courtesan, not a mere mistress; she could pick and choose anyone, even at her age; that's made perfectly clear.<br />Aspasia comes along Primula's relation Sarah Jane, who's lying in the street.  When Sarah Jane had been propositioned, she ran and went for help, but the servants and &quot;respectable&quot; people turned her away, despite the fact thatshe was an upper class woman down on her luck (her father had left her and her mother penniless, so she'd gone to work as a governess).  Only Aspasia would help her, and if Aspasia hadn't found her, she would have died.<br />So, of course, Severn's young nephew gets involved with Sarah Jane while she's staying at Aspasia's, and he's sensible enough not to care -- but &quot;High Society&quot; surely would, and Aspasia knows it.  They run off to get married, which causes Aspasia to join forces with Primula.  They chase after the nephew and Sarah Jane, hoping to keep them from folly -- which causes Severn to go after Primula, which finally makes Primula see that they're destined for each other.  (I know their reconciliation scene was a bit before the &quot;merry chase&quot; scenes, but I view their true marriage starting right there.)  After this, there's a Shakespeare-style denouement that explains why the Earl was so nasty (Severn has already apologized to Primula for his earlier bad behavior), then everyone manages to live happily every after -- even the Earl and Aspasia.<br />Granted, without the comedy, this book wouldn't be any fun.  The characters mostly aren't as deep as in most of Ms. Edghill's other books, and the action is frenetic.  Yes, there are the stereotypical &quot;gaming hell&quot; and dancing scenes, but they are perfunctory -- which once again proves that this isn't a romance at all, but a screwball comedy.<br />And if you're looking for other literature that is more a sort of screwball comedy than anything else, look to Shakespeare.  &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; &quot;All's Well That Ends Well,&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; all have plots that sound patently ridiculous without the humor -- just as Ms. Edghill's &quot;Fleeting Fancy&quot; does.<br />The main reason this book deserves four stars and a recommended tag is that I kept laughing uproariously, to the point that my husband had to leave the room because he was getting deafened by my laughter.  In addition, &quot;Fleeting Fancy&quot; is a rather nifty prequel to my favorite of Ms. Edghill's four Regencies, &quot;Two of a Kind,&quot; and that made me laugh even harder.<br />So, despite the fact that my review is going completely against the experts, who appear to have missed the point of what this book was about, I recommend this book and hope that, if you can find it, you'll enjoy it, too.<br />Four stars.  Recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-01-27
US	32010417	R10U9AIPNBN2OJ	0765303582	164593090	Shadowsinger (Spellsong Cycle)	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Not one of Modesitt's best	\\"Shadowsinger\\" leaves a whole lot to be desired.<br />Lady Secca, Sorceress-Protector of Defalk, has married Alcaren, hidden Sorcerer and Lord of Ranauk (where women rule), and they're in deep, deep trouble.  At the end of \\"The Shadow Sorceress\\" (book 4), the Maitre of Sturinn was on the loose, a nasty Sorcerer has gained power in Neserea, and no one knew what was going on there despite all their scrying with mirrors.<br />Secca and Alcaren do have some assistance as they set off to fight; they have the help of the Matriarchy of Ranauk (this comes in handy during several sea battles, which are ridden out on Matriarchy-controlled ships) along with some minor assistance from the state of Norwei.  And they have Secca's experienced musicians (\\"players\\"), who accompany her and boost her power, along with an assistant sorceress who's rapidly improving (Richina) to spell her now and again, as well as a whole lot of grit and nerve.  They're willing to fight the \\"good fight,\\" and keep the Sturrinese and the nasty Nesereans out of Defalk, and aid their sworn allies to the best of their ability.<br />In between fighting battles with the various folks out to get them, Secca and her cohorts must fight her own land's leader, Lord Robero.  He's afraid of her, yet he needs her to defeat Defalk's enemies; it's a very subtle balance, and the pendulum is starting to slip.<br />And the Sturrinese, a nasty race of men who enslave and chain their women, are making overtures toward Robero, too.  Meaning Secca and the others have a whole lot more problems.<br />All of that is fine, as far as it goes.  But I think Modesitt went too far with the Sturrinese, as they are just too maliciously evil to be believable.  They are the equivalent of Germany under Hitler and the Nazis -- but worse.<br />Even Nazis didn't chain their own kinfolk.<br />The rank evilness of the Sturrinese causes all sorts of other difficulties, because it just doesn't logically fly.  Simply put: I'm supposed to believe that the Sturrinese men have been willfully chaining and torturing their women for umpteen-hundred years?  All of them?  Why?  Why do this to their mothers, their sisters, their lovers?  And even if they believe it's right, morally and ethically, it still makes no sense.<br />Why would they want to take 1/2 of their work-force out of the equation? (Trust me, with the type of chains those women wear, they are not able to do most labor, and even doing \\"minor household tasks\\" would be a major stretch.  They wouldn't be able to do much else with the constant strain of carrying around and wearing those nasty heavy chains.)  How can they afford to do something as idiotic as that?<br />And why hasn't their \\"empire\\" fallen about their heads long before this out of sheer stupidity?<br />Getting back to the story, the Maitre, leader of the Sturrinese and their most powerful Sorcerer, says that they've united 1/4 of the world under their \\"beneficent leadership\\" (paraphrase mine).  Why would anyone else in the world sit still for this?  Sorcerers can be taken out, and not just by other Sorcerors/Sorceresses (we only saw it happen once, I think in book 2, but it has happened and probably could happen more if people used tactics instead of brute force); a massed force could have toppled these asinine, ahem, *individuals* long before this book starts.<br />That took a full one and one half stars away from the potential five right there.  And could have taken far more, if the rest wasn't so engaging.<br />In addition, although I like Secca and Alcaren very much as characters, they don't get much time to grow together, and the romance between them is truncated.  I disliked that very much.  Even when times are hard and bad, if you're partners and you believe in one another and trust each other, you can find more time for romance.  Granted, Modesitt hints very well and there is some very subtle romance going on (as well as some not-so-subtle lust).  But it's not enough for my taste.<br/>In addition, I don't believe Secca would take over as Lady of Defalk, not after all Anna had to do to stay out of that position.  Granted, Secca can still have children; she's in her mid-30s, and she's not too old, plus she could always adopt (this was a possibility with Anna if Anna had kept the throne).  But one of the big points made in both books 4 and 5 was that Alyssa, Robero's consort, was smart and tough.  Granted, Alyssa couldn't keep Robero from doing stupid things, but was it her fault she couldn't control him?  She's no sorceress, only a very smart woman, who got the Hell out of the way when it was clear to her that her husband was Hell-bent on destruction (which, to me at least, proved how smart she was).<br />It would have made more sense to have had Alyssa resume holding Defalk as ruling _Lady_ -- and have the heirs be picked by her, Jolyn, and Secca alike.  Secca shouldn't be the ruler, because there is at least one nasty Sturrinese priest out there, and anyway, the other lands are going to be in violent upheaval for quite some time. She doesn't have time to both be a ruler _and_ put down all the strife in my opinion.<br />And by Modesitt putting Secca on the throne, it brought up another question.  I kept wondering how Secca, who was the pre-eminent sorceress of the world of Erde, was going to be able to train successors?  Granted, Richina (her assistant) is well on the way to becoming independent, but Secca shields Richina from the worst spells and doesn't seem to want to let Richina in on the decision making, meaning at best that Richina, once she starts taking students, won't be able to teach ethics or decision making.  And that's not right, because Richina is powerful (albeit young), and deserves to know what's going on.<br />And there was one writing idiosyncrasy that drove me nuts throughout all five books of this series.  Every time Modesitt goes away from his main character (whether it's Anna in books 1-3 or Secca in 4-5), he switches frompast tense to present tense, almost as if to say, \\"We're looking through someone else's eyes now!\\"<br />Trust me.  The reader can figure that out without this sort of clue.  There's no reason to do this, it's distracting, and every time Modesitt did it, it made my teeth grind.  Which is why I took another 1/2 star away.<br />Now that I've gone through the minuses, let me count the pluses.  The characterizations were very good in the main; Secca and Alcaren are believable, vivid people.  I especially liked Palian, the Chief Player.  I enjoyed the idea of harmonies and dissonances being used as a form of magic (although I'm still unsure as to how it'd work, exactly).  And I believed in the struggles Secca was having with her usage of power.<br />Still.  Compared to \\"Adiamante\\" or the four books about the Ecolitans or even to books 1-3 of this own cycle, it doesn't work.  It's not as strong as it could have been, and that's a shame.<br />Three stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2004-01-24

This particular library has only one claim to fame; every so often, a member of the staff disappears from the face of the Earth.<br />And that's what happens to Ruth, too, when she goes to answer an alarm on a holiday.  She and her boss, Nicholas Brightlaw, end up being transported to Melior's realm, Chandrakar -- but Melior didn't call them, and he knows nothing about them being there.  Which means both Ruth and Nic are in deadly peril from the start in a strange land; the only advantage they have is that, perhaps due to the translation, they understand and can speak the local language.<br />Ruth meets up with Fox, formerly known as Philip LeStrange -- he, too, had been transported unwittingly to Chandrakar a few years earlier than Ruth from the same library.  Fox is embittered, as humans are treated lower than dirt by most.<br />Then, along the way, Ruth meets up with Jauressande, an Elf woman who's related to Melior.  But Jauressande can barely stand the sight of Ruth (she views Ruth's love for Melior as an abomination) and absolutely hates Fox, as Fox has raised the humans in the countryside to rebel against their Elven overlords.<br />The Cup of Morning Shadows is the object Jauressande must have at the Elven conclave, but it's been stolen, and she's in trouble.  She grudgingly agrees, after Nic intercedes (she respects him from the start despite him being human), to place Ruth and Fox under her protection, and they all go off to search for it, having many adventures along the way.<br />Basically, where the first book, \\"Sword of Maiden's Tears,\\" was a character study in a humorous urban fantasy setting, \\"Cup of Morning Shadows\\" is an adventure story.  The humor is present, but somewhat muted, and most of what Ruth and Nic find out isn't particularly likable.  And the story does end on a major cliffhanger (which seems to happen in most of Ms. Edghill's books). ;)<br />Two points to consider.  One, if you're looking for the same sort of plot-mixture as the first book, you won't find it here.  The horror element is absent or, better yet, transmuted -- the horror in \\"Cup\\" is that the Elves have the upper hand and don't want to give it up.  Melior is an extreme liberal in this society, in that he has fallen in love and wishes to marry a human woman -- most Elves do not believe humans are worth more than the mud under their boots (thus the epithet \\"mud-born,\\" although the formal name of humanity in Chandrakar is \\"the Children of Earth\\").  Second, this book starts much slower than the previous book, as Ms. Edghill must build an entirely new landscape from scratch while continuing to keep her two major characters (Ruth and Melior) from book one in the dark about most events.  This isn't a flaw at all, but it is a major change from the previous book (where the milieu was of contemporary Earth, so the book could start faster as the reader has more cultural referents).<br />I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventurous urban fantasy.  Four stars, recommended.<br />And if you like this book, you'll almost certainly enjoy the current Mercedes Lackey-Rosemary Edghill collaborations \\"Mad Maudlin,\\" \\"Spirits White as Lightning,\\" and \\"Beyond World's End.\\"  (Along with anything else Ms. Edghill has ever written.	2004-01-23
US	32010417	RU5DIGSCZXZU8	0312289197	153434248	Queenmaker: A Novel of King David's Queen	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Excellent historical fiction	I have the suspicion that King David was much like how India Edghill portrays him in &quot;Queenmaker,&quot; which is the untold story of Michal, David's first wife and head of his household.<br />That is, David was a kind and generous man, full of life and love and interest, until he started believing his own hype.  There are hints of this in the Bible in my opinion; the fact that he nearly was unseated (refused to see that his son Absalom could and would try to take his throne, for example) was a wake-up call, causing him to rule more wisely afterward.<br />In the Bible, King David rallied behind Joab, and the rest of his family supported him, including Solomon, who was eventually named as his heir.  However, there always seemed to be a bit left out of the story; Ms. Edghill supplies some badly needed contextual references to perhaps explain what was really going on.<br />I think that showing David as a flawed human who was capable of much cruelty, in addition to much love, makes sense.  Because really, if David had loved Michal, he would have left her alone -- or, conversely, he'd have gone after her immediately, and not allowed his wife to be married off to Phaltiel in the first place.<br />And people who are capable of great love often _are_ capable of the exact opposite, even toward their own family members.  People with great gifts have to be careful not to become hubristic; I have always thought this a &quot;hidden subtext&quot; of most of the later verses that dealt with King David, and I feel Ms. Edghill using it in her novel was appropriate.<br />And Ms. Edghill is also right to point out that David didn't even bother to go after Michal until long after Phaltiel and Michal had formed a real partnership, and after her brother Jonathan had died (David was particularly close to him in his youth).  Then, David's generals called Michal to him again.  After ten years of nothing, David wanted her back, partly because of politics, and partly because it helped tocement his rule.<br />I'm absolutely sure that David wasn't thinking much of Michal's happiness at that point; why would he?  More to the point, why _should_ he, as he knew what he needed to do, he knew what God had told him to do, and he knew what he must do?  So he did it, but it hurt her, and I don't think he cared overmuch.<br />The fact that she made much of her life, formed alliances with others such as Bathsheba, and became powerful after being ignored for ten years was a credit to her intelligence and her strength of character -- and it's a story worth telling.<br />At any rate, the other wives David had married in the interim didn't appreciate Michal coming in, nor her being put over all of them due to hers being the initial marriage.  Plus, Michal isn't pleased, either; she'd grown to love Phaltiel and his son, and wanted to continue on as a farmwife.<br />But David wouldn't let her do that; he insisted she stay with him, and although Michal wanted to go to Phaltiel, she wasn't allowed.  Phaltiel was killed; Michal always wondered if David had done it, and was convinced that he had.<br />Plus, when Michal married David, she was only thirteen or fourteen, and the first -- and only -- wife.  When David reclaimed her, she now was first of many, and she didn't like it.  Who could blame her?<br />There was also some inkling in this novel that David might have been one of the types of men, like Elvis Presley, that wasn't interested in a woman as a woman once she'd given him heirs.  Granted, there's absolutely no way to know if this was true or not, but it's a good supposition by Ms. Edghill -- otherwise, why didn't David put Michal aside?  No matter how beautiful Michal was, no matter how smart she was, shouldn't he have put her aside once political expedience had been satisfied?<br />Or were the people that upset at the thought of David putting Michal aside?<br />I can't really believe that, so I tend to believe that Ms. Edghill's premise is the more realistic.<br />In addition, David had not much love for Solomon; this is easily seen if you read the Bible between the lines.  Yet Solomon was named over David's other heirs at the last minute, on his deathbed.  I think Ms. Edghill might be on to something; Michal and Bathsheba and many others knew that they wanted nothing else to happen like what had nearly happened with Absalom; they wanted their kingdom to be safe and secure, ruled wisely, and for them to live out the remains of their lives in peace.<br />If the truth is as Ms. Edghill paints, I'm glad that Michal was there.  Because there is a ring of truth in all of it, something that convinces me on the emotional level, that this might well be the truth.<br />And if David was senile, or had some terrible disease, and wasn't able to make decisions at the end of his life, so what?  That doesn't make what he did earlier in his life, the things worthy of praise, invalid.  It makes him more human, and puts his good deeds in stark relief.<br />I applaud Ms. Edghill for this interesting historical tale, and hope she'll write more historical fiction soon, as she does so with great flair.<br />Five stars.  Highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-12-31

The three authors in question, Mercedes Lackey, Rachel Lee, and Catherine Asaro, do a workmanlike job exploring various aspects of the romantic fantasy genre.<br />The &quot;lesser light&quot; of the group, Rachel Lee, was the most interesting author.  Her story, &quot;Drusilla's Dream,&quot; was the best of the three by a wide margin.   This was an unusual take on an urban fantasy, and I liked it very much.  It was funny, interesting, and moving.  There were a few very minor plotholes; for example, if Miles, her hero, had his eyes on Drusilla the whole time, the first time he sees her outside the shared daydream/computer storyline should be explained differently.  Which is why this story doesn't get five stars; instead, it gets four.  But a very strong four.  And I'll be looking for more stuff from Ms. Lee.<br />I'm already a regular reader of Ms. Lackey, and I enjoyed her story, &quot;Counting Crows.&quot; This was a period romance based in the medieval era of our Earth, and was nicely executed, even though in some respects, this was more a story about a brother and sister avoiding disaster than a romance; the romantic element was definitely secondary.  But I liked Sir Atremus, and I enjoyed Gwynhwyfar's attraction to him.  And the &quot;spin,&quot; where it took a long time for the two of them to hook up, was an interesting one.  Three and a half stars for this story.<br />I liked Ms. Asaro's premise for &quot;Moonglow.&quot;  This was an altogether new fantasy world, and the idea was very good.  I liked the shape-magic.  However, the execution of this story left a lot to be desired.  The dialect used for Iris was not consistently applied, and I thought the story's ending a bit rushed.  In addition, the fact that major mages could be out in the open where no one could pick up how powerful they are doesn't make any sense; the other, lesser mages should be able to pick up the power, even if it's never used.<br />That was a major plothole.<br />In addition, Ms. Asaro has some very unusual and offputting word choices.  For example, she uses the word &quot;coronate&quot; in the following fashion:  &quot;We cannot coronate him tomorrow.&quot;  Considering the rest is more or less in American idiomatic English, this threw me right out of the reader's trance.<br />So, despite the very strong and engaging plot premise, the story fell flat because the characters didn't engage me very much, and the execution of the writing was flawed.  Two stars at best for this story, only because I liked the character of the foster father, Stone.<br />Overall: three and a half stars.  Not bad at all, worth the money, and if the new Harlequin Luna line is much like this stuff, it should sell quite nicely.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-12-30

However, \\"Sun in Glory\\" has its moments, mostly because there are four or five very strong stories that overshadow the weaker ones.<br />The four strong stories are by Ms. Lackey herself, Rosemary Edghill, Nancy Asire, and Tanya Huff.  Ms. Huff's story, \\"Brock,\\" was the most off-concept, as she wrote about a mentally challenged man who had all the attributed of a Herald, but could not be one due to his other problems.  Despite that, he was exemplary, and even though he couldn't realize he wasn't a *real* Herald, the actual Heralds mostly left him alone, or helped him.<br />I also enjoyed Ms. Edghill's story, \\"Icebreaker,\\" which was another off-concept story.  Her hero wanted to be a Herald, but when he got a taste of it, he decided he wanted no part of that.  Which is realistic; Valdemar needs more than just Heralds, or the kingdom will die out.  It needs its scribes, its scholars, its librarians.<br />And those people make just as much of a difference as the others.  Just in a quieter way.<br />Ms. Asire's story, \\"The Cat Who Came to Dinner,\\" was amusing and moving.  It was about Reulan, the last truly good head Sun-priest in Karse before Solaris (a several century gap).  Reulan is a plainspoken man, a good priest, someone who cares about his flock.  And who knows nothing about Firecats, until he meets one.<br />Great story.<br />And Ms. Lackey uses some of the material from Ms. Asire's story in her own \\"Sun in Glory,\\" which concludes this collection.  \\"Sun in Glory\\" is a sort of outtake that explains how Talia gained ascendance in Karse, and shows Alberich's more quiet reunion.<br />The other stories are hit and miss.  Some are good.  I liked most of them.  But they weren't as outstanding as these four.<br />The one really poor story, that makes no sense in the established chronology of the whole world of Velgarth as Ms. Lackey has conceived of it, was Catherine McMullen's \\"Herald's Journey.\\"  I don't care how young Ms. McMullen is; she needs to read over her chronology again.  Errold's Grove could not have come into being like this.  It's too close to Iftel, which is protected; we find out why in the \\"Storm\\" books and at the tail end of the \\"Mage Winds\\" trilogy.  Basically, the Kaled'a'in went to Iftel, and stayed there.  That's why Iftel has been so reclusive.  Those people were afraid, and they didn't want to come out of hiding until they were absolutely sure either no one could catch them, or do anything with them, or it was absolutely necessary.<br />I can't believe anyone would want to get that close to the remains of their own people, yet refuse to go the rest of the way to Iftel.  And if those mages were powerful enough to feel the rupture of the earth halfway across the globe, they should have been able to feel those refugees in Iftel.<br />Plus, the story isn't all that well written. It's fine for a twelve year old, but it's not professional, and I don't know why it's in this book.<br />It's by far the weakest story in it, and it leads off everything else.  I have to say that choice puzzles me.  I'd have led off with Ms. Asire's story, as it was hundreds of years before any other story in the book outside of Ms. McMullen's.<br />That being said, I recommend this anthology, but also recommend that you check out the superior \\"Sword of Ice.\\"  Four stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-12-30
US	32010417	R56GK7GRJOYWZ	0451452488	41397084	Ice Crown	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Ice Crown rules	&quot;Ice Crown&quot; is my absolute favorite Andre Norton book.  In it, a young woman who has never had much respect (either from herself or others) finds meaning and purpose in her life, finds friends, finds happiness -- and overcomes many obstacles.<br />The obstacles in the way are both internal and external.  The internal ones deal with Roane throwing off her uncle Offlas' mental conditioning -- the same conditioning that told Roane all her life that she was nothing but a tool in his hands, something rather than someone.  The external ones deal with the planet Clio; Roane, her uncle and her cousin Sandar land on Clio to look over ruins in secret.  The colony below knows nothing of offworlders; they were settled by dissidents called &quot;Psychocrats&quot; who believed that people, in gaining technology, had lost something.<br />However, in order to regain what they'd lost, the Psychocrats have set up a terrible situation for Clio's inhabitants.  The Crowns the rulers wear (a quasi-feudal society) dictate how they act; if the Crown doesn't want something, even if the ruler does, the Crown wins.  It's not a good situation.<br />However, everything's about to change, as Roane gets lost during a terrible storm, and takes cover in an old, abandoned building.  Princess Ludorica, who's just been captured by thugs, gets dropped off in the same building.  Roane and Ludorica escape, form an unlikely friendship/alliance, and find Ludorica's long-lost Crown.<br />However, Ludorica's actions change as soon as the Crown is found.  She repudiates old friends, such as Colonel Nelis Imfry, and turns instead to age-old enemies, such as Duke Reddick, to consolidate her rule.  This is due to the Crown's influence.  Imfry nearly dies; Roane helps him to escape.<br />And then the real fun begins, as Roane must choose between everything she thought she knew, or her own conscience.  Along the way, she finds love with Nelis, who understands her like no one else despite being from a rather backward culture.<br />I don't want to give away the rest of the plot, so I'll end here.  Does Roane win out?  See for yourself.<br />And if you like &quot;Ice Crown,&quot; be sure to pick up &quot;Warlock,&quot; which contains &quot;Storm Over Warlock,&quot; &quot;Ordeal in Otherwhere,&quot; and &quot;Forerunner Foray,&quot; three great Norton titles at a low price.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />P.S. I hope someone picks this book up to be reprinted soon; it truly is one of the strongest works in the entire Norton oeuvre.	2003-12-04
US	32010417	R397XRHYR7AUHF	0743471555	615518822	1633 (Ring of Fire)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good, interesting, well thought out alternate history	\\"1633\\" isn't quite the novel I expected, but it's still good.<br />Let me try to explain.  First, \\"1633\\" is deeper than \\"1632,\\" which is a plus.  Some characters, such as John and Mary Simpson (the CEO and his socialite wife), are fleshed out and made human.  That's terrific.  OTOH, because Flint and Weber are depicting a war zone, war preparations, and showing politics, there isn't as much human interaction in some ways as there was in \\"1632.\\"<br />But the political referents are spot on (perhaps because of all the helpful folks in Eric Flint's 1632 Tech Manual conference at Baen's Bar; Mr. Flint talks about how helpful they are, and it sure seems that way), the intrigue makes sense, the worldbuilding is superlative, and I felt there was plenty of action in the \\"minor skirmish\\" sense.  (Of course, at least two of the \\"minor skirmishes\\" would have become major battles if not for the modern technology the West Virginians brought with them, or at least the modern ideas they used to create or re-create the modern tech.)<br />However, the main relationships I enjoyed from the first book, namely Mike Stearns and his lovely wife Rebecca Abrabanel, Julie and Alex MacKay, Melissa and the Doctor, etc., are totally missing.  There's a little byplay with Rita Stearns and her husband the WVA football player, Tom Simpson, but it's not enough.<br />And although I loved the development of John and Mary Simpson, and enjoyed very much how a few of the German princes came along as things went, and enjoyed seeing Gretchen Richter and her husband Jeff and how they got along, it just wasn't enough, character-wise, to truly suit me.<br />Which is why I cannot in good conscience give this book 5 stars.<br />However, I can't really see how they could have done things any differently; Rebecca is using her knowledge of the rulers and her new, powerful position as wife to the most important man in all of Europe to do what's necessary.  And Rita Stearns, et. al., didn't know they'd get lockedup in the Tower of London.<br />And I must admit, I really enjoyed Oliver Cromwell's characterization, and the spots of humor now and again in the book.<br />Also, I had no problem envisioning Mike Stearns' transformation to consummate politician; it was obvious that Rebecca saw something in him, and she helped him develop it.  What's wrong with that?  In addition, I bought how James the doctor could form an alliance with Tom Stone the recreational chemist (one of the best new characters in the book; thank you, Mercedes Lackey, for thinking him up -- that's yet another \\"thank you\\" Mr. Flint inserted into the remarks at the end of the book), and how the two of them could and would try to help despite having rather limited resources.  And finally, I really liked the new character of Colonel Jesse Wood (Mike Spehar, a longtime fan and pilot, thought _him_ up), and appreciated the difference even a rudimentary Air Force could make in the 1632-and-beyond-universe.  The new characters helped a great deal, and I look forward to seeing them developed in future books.<br />Even so, I'd put this as not quite as good at the original \\"1632,\\" but still a worthy, interesting book.  I'm hoping that \\"1634\\" will have more character development among the original characters, and that Mike and Rebecca (among others) will actually get to spend more time together in it, too.<br />Four stars, recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-12-04

Ms. Klasky's writing shows more depth and breadth, and her narrative flows more smoothly than in her debut novel.<br />One thing I really enjoyed about this book is that it wasn't what I expected.  Rani Trader and her companion Mair of the Touched are immediately abducted by Prince Bashnorandi, and carried off to the court of Sin Hazar.  Sin Hazar is an enemy of Morenia's King Halaravilli (or King Hal, for short), mainly because his society is quite different, and because Sin Hazar was raised to take anything he wanted due to how _his_ country views castes.<br />Rani and Mair form new alliances while King Hal tries desperately to find out what's happened to them; Hal must discard old alliances in favor of a new, uncertain future, and the outcome is always in doubt.<br />As I've said before, Ms. Klasky is superlative at showing moral ambiguity, and how the choices a person makes are more important than they might seem.<br />All in all, I'd call &quot;Glasswright's Progress&quot; a very strong book, one that succeeds in telling a darkly realistic tale.  I would have liked to see more about Rani's quest to rebuilt the Glasswright's Guild, but I suppose that can wait for later books.<br />I really debated about what amount of stars to give this book; it's very good, and makes all its points.  And I really enjoyed Rani and Mair in this book, far more than in the previous book (and I liked them there, too).  Which is why I rounded up to five stars.<br />And I'd definitely recommend it.  It's very interesting, and it might even stand on its own (without the first book, &quot;Glasswright's Apprentice&quot;), although it definitely is enriched by reading &quot;Apprentice&quot; first.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-11-23
US	32010417	R3FHSYKFLH66RR	1892065428	962143082	Chains of Freedom	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fun, fast read	&quot;Chains of Freedom&quot; is a fun, fast read.  RJ is a soldier, an Elite, one of the highest caste members of the Reliance; she's now out for vengeance, after the Reliance made her do something she strongly disagreed with (killing non-soldiers for the &quot;greater good&quot; of the Reliance).  David Grant is an escaped worker on the run.  David's managed to teach himself to read and write, something not many workers manage to do; he's intelligent and has the soul of a fighter.<br />RJ takes him in, mainly because she trusts him instinctively.  As things go on, we find out more about RJ the super-soldier and David the worker-turned-politician, and see what drives them together -- and apart.<br />It's a very quick read that raises some interesting points amidst the trappings of a more or less standard space opera plot.  Basically, why should we trust our leaders?  How can we keep absolute power from corrupting absolutely?<br />And it answers an unusual question -- what would happen if identical twins were raised differently?  Would they be the same, or would they be different?  And why?<br />Very interesting ideas are the subtext to an engaging, interesting read.  Four stars, recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-11-23
US	32010417	R2VOYB9IXAE0JX	067157776X	109461275	In The Company of Mind	Books	5	0	0	N	N	An interesting premise	&quot;In the Company of Mind&quot; is the type of book I wish more s/f books would emulate.  It takes a psychological premise, adds technology, and gets a knock-your-socks-off action/adventure/thriller/romance. :)<br />J. Lance Blackstone seems to have everything, but he really doesn't.  His father is incredibly, viciously abusive, and his mother is powerless to stop it.  In addition, his father is an extremely powerful and wealthy man, on the order of a Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, or maybe even like one of the Saudi oil sheikhs.  Because of this, it's very hard for his mother to get him away . . . but she eventually does.<br />However, because of the longterm stresses Lance has endured, his personality has separated out into 47 personalities, including one woman (Jessica), a homicidal maniac (Patrick), a &quot;big brother&quot; type (Garth), the grandfather Lance wished he had (Grandpa Jack), and many others.  These don't make it easier for Lance, but he comes up with a novel solution; he'll use his extra personalities effectively as an aid to commerce, forming his own security &quot;company&quot; -- what others don't know is that it's effectively a company of one.<br />Aided by Robin, an AI inside his own mind, Lance can effectively talk with his alter egos, and uses their knowledge to help others.   But there's a problem . . . his father still wants him back, and as Lance and his mother have went their own separate ways after she managed to divorce his father (by an effective bit of blackmail), the only way to bait Lance is to use his girlfriend, Delia, as bait in a most elaborate trap . . .  .<br />The rest is for you to read. :)  But I think you'll want to read it; it's an exceptionally interesting book, one filled with a great deal of research, some humor despite the grim situation(s), and a rather sweet romance between the overburdened and overstressed, mentally handicapped (via MPD) Lance and the overstressed, physically handicapped Delia.<br />Five stars,highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />P.S. Two other books you might enjoy if you liked this one are Lois McMaster Bujold's &quot;Mirror Dance,&quot; and Sharon Lee and Steve Miller's &quot;Scout's Progress.&quot;  Both deal with people who were badly abused making their way, and doing it with flair despite their emotional damage, and are well worth the read. :)	2003-10-24
US	32010417	R2TBAX6S36U2KB	0812519655	814043193	Sacred Ground	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Well-researched, extremely readable book	&quot;Sacred Ground&quot; is one of Mercedes Lackey's more serious urban fantasy offerings.  It's steeped in Native American culture, folklore and legend (as much that would have been history was destroyed long before the start of this book -- early 1990s -- by unsuspecting, unthinking or uncaring sorts), and it illustrates several major and growing problems.<br />1) How are Native Americans treated in this country?<br />2) Can spirituality be integrated into a modern person's life in a meaningful way?<br />3) Is it worthwhile to help people, always knowing that there are more people who need help than you can afford to help out there?<br />The last two are answered with an emphatic &quot;YES!&quot;  The first one is problematic at best.  Jennifer Talldeer, an interesting character if I've ever seen one, talked about the problems of &quot;registering&quot; with the Bureau of Indian Affairs vs. _not_ registering, and chose not to register (as most of her family, if not all, had also chosen).  She also showed the difficulty of doing a tough job (private investigator) well, despite being less than five feet tall and rather slight of build.  She uses her mind, her heart, and her spirituality to get her through; I think she's an admirable role model for anyone seeking such, and an excellent protagonist for a whole series of novels (would Tor care to resurrect the series, something that looks highly doubtful at this point).<br />Jennifer's relationship with her grandfather, Mooncrow, is also intriguing.  Mooncrow isn't all that traditional in some senses; he loves Nintendo, he eats lots of pizza, he cooks, and he's after her throughout the book to, um, find a fulfilling lover.  Not too many grandfathers do this, I don't think.<br />Mooncrow is a highly contradictory person, as evidenced by his name.  Crows are never white, nor do they fly at night, yet Mooncrow . . . well, he delights in being contrary.  So it's no surprise that he's found a spiritual successor in his granddaughter, despite that being highly unusual.  It's also no surprise that he's teaching her everything he knows, despite the fact that women normally aren't taught so much.  (&quot;Good for Mooncrow&quot; is what I kept muttering while reading.)<br />Jennifer's true name is Kestrel-Hunts-Alone, which is a far, far more straightforward name by any standard than Mooncrow's, and as such, she's shown to be driven, nearly obsessed, and that obsession has cost her things she hasn't realized.  There is external conflict in the mystery, which quickly turns from &quot;who did it&quot; to &quot;why did he do it?&quot;  And there is loads of internal conflict provided by Jennifer herself, her mission(s), and her relationship with David Spotted Horse, the man who &quot;got away&quot; years ago.  (Of course, he was not worth keeping years ago, either.  Perhaps now is different?)<br />Ms. Lackey effortlessly shows how modern women make a living, and combines that with a spiritual quest, some thrilling action-adventure, and a romance.  This is an extremely moving book, it is emotionally honest, and it gets almost everything spot on.  <br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-10-16
US	32010417	R21QV9WA19WPWJ	0380979020	547078013	Paladin of Souls: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Other Bujold -- but still wonderful	&quot;Paladin of Souls&quot; isn't minor Bujold; it's much better than &quot;Spirit Ring&quot; or &quot;Cetaganda,&quot; two novels I'd characterize as good -- but very minor -- works from Bujold's fingertips.  It also isn't what I'd term major Bujold, a la &quot;Mirror Dance&quot; or &quot;A Civil Campaign,&quot; two wildly different -- but extremely successful in every respect -- novels set in her Vorkosigan universe.<br />Instead, it is other Bujold, and with a vengeance.<br />In &quot;Paladin,&quot; Dowager Royina Ista takes up the shreds of her life and forges a new path, one she'd fled from much earlier in her life.  As not quite a cleric, and not quite a sorceress, Ista finds challenges, overcomes tribulations, and even finds a love she is able to accept when she'd given up all hope of such things many years earlier.<br />&quot;Paladin&quot; is a sequel of sorts to &quot;Curse of Chalion,&quot; an unabashedly great other Bujold novel.  This isn't quite as good as that novel in my estimation, although it's very fine in its own way.  (Note that it's incredibly hard to rate any Bujold novel on a 1 to 5 scale, because every single one of them has things to offer that very few other writers are able to encapsulate so well.)  But they're novels which do markedly different things; &quot;Curse&quot; showed Cazaril the scholar, and his ascent back from Hell, along with his hero's journey.  &quot;Paladin&quot; isn't quite a heroine's journey, and isn't quite a half a dozen other things.<br />What it is, instead, is an unusual and deeply moving novel about second chances, all unlooked for.  And the power of the human heart, without which the Gods would be nothing.<br />I'd say &quot;Paladin&quot; is the second-best novel I've read this year, ranking solely behind Rosemary Edghill's &quot;Vengeance of Masks.&quot;  The only things both novels have in common are an unusual and unlikely love story, and a main character who doesn't know how to believe in him or herself at the start of the book -- one who's been placed in a nearly impossible position, and one who's been forced to deal _anyway_.<br />That might be why I like both books so well.<br />In closing, I'd say &quot;Paladin&quot; is spiritually rich, deeply developed, and a wonderful character study of a woman who, rather than turns away from destiny, embraces it instead.  And rather than fearing her new life (as she's always been an incredibly formidable woman), she finds a way to enjoy it -- and learns to appreciate herself for who she is.<br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-10-12
US	32010417	RN1ALLFQ65U3A	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Terrific "other" Bujold novel	Lois McMaster Bujold is a novelist who's work is so good that it's almost impossible to characterize her stuff in any conventional sense.  Even her more \\"minor\\" novels, such as \\"Cetaganda\\" or \\"The Spirit Ring,\\" are interesting and well thought out; her \\"major\\" novels, such as \\"Mirror Dance\\" or \\"A Civil Campaign\\" (among others) are all of that and the bag of chips besides. :)<br />Yet I found it hard to classify \\"Curse of Chalion,\\" partly because it was so different from anything else Ms. Bujold had ever written before.  It's a classic hero's journey, yes; Lupe dy Cazaril, swordsman and scholar, had been left behind on purpose due to an enemy's callous act, and nearly died several times as an oarsman on a slaveship before his ship was liberated.  After fleeing the ship and being nursed back to health, Cazaril makes his way toward the one woman he believes might both be powerful enough to help and be moved enough by his plight to help him -- the Provincara dy Baocia.<br />Once there, the Provincara begs his aid; seems her granddaughter, the royesse Iselle (basically, the princess, who's third in line to the throne of Chalion) needs a tutor.  She's too wild and willful for most women tutors, who don't respect her mind well enough; Cazaril, who's literally seen Hell itself, isn't afraid of her, or of anything (though he doesn't realize it).  He takes her on, in the process also teaching her lady in waiting, Betriz dy Ferrej, daughter of the castle warder.<br />Because the Provincara is the mother in law of the dowager royina, Cazaril doesn't have to fear for his life.  Yet there's danger stalking the kingdom; danger of a type never seen before.  And it's up to Cazaril to figure out the danger, stop it in its tracks, and then pick up the pieces . . . if he can.<br />Sound interesting?  It's even more interesting than that to read, as there's a highly involved theology going on with the Five Gods (Father, Mother, Daughter, Son, and Bastard), the courtly intrigue is spot on, and the dangers inherent for crowned heads laid plain for all to see.<br />This is one of my favorite books, even if I can't really classify it in the \\"Bujold pantheon,\\" as it's simply so different from her previous work.  But that doesn't matter; read this book.  You'll enjoy it, you'll appreciate it, and you might even learn something from it.<br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-10-12
US	32010417	R22C3UC5B4TV0Q	0449210820	828917815	Woman on the Edge of Time	Books	5	41	43	N	N	Excellent read	&quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot; is an excellent read.  Marge Piercy did an outstanding job with this book; it was written in the 1970s, and does not appear dated.  The themes are universal; how does anyone live with hopelessness and despair when their back is against the wall?  And, can love win out over hate?<br />I'm not doing Ms. Piercy's book justice; there aren't any words to describe how profoundly meaningful this book is about those universal themes.<br />As for the plot, Connie Ramos is in her mid-30s, has had mental problems in the past, had her daughter taken away from her due to Connie's having gone through a rough patch in her life (her partner died and no one cared about it but her; she acted out and did drugs, which caused her to mistreat her daughter).  No one seems to care about Connie; she's lost her looks, she has no money, and even her favorite people mostly just ignore her.<br />What astonishes me about Connie and her plight is that she is intelligent.  She had some college, yet no one that deals with her ever considers her intelligent _or_ educated.  And that's stupid; really, why didn't her welfare caseworker say, &quot;Oh, Connie, you have a year or two of college.  Would you like to be re-trained?&quot;  In real life, this might have happened.<br />However, this _is_ a fable; that can be overlooked.  Besides, the social services in the 1970s in New York were terrible; they rivaled the situation that New York faces today after the terrorist attacks.  There are too many people; it's very easy to get lost in the cracks.  So this isn't a plot hole at all; it's a statement about how good people often get downtrodden through no fault of their own.<br />Anyway, Connie isn't listened to about anything, so when her niece comes in and begs for sanctuary, Connie probably should have sent her away.  But Connie's kindhearted; she doesn't.  That kind act gets Connie beaten and thrown into a mental hospital; while trying to defend her niece (who thenpromptly goes back with her abusive partner, a pimp), she broke the pimp's nose.  He gets Connie committed, as she has a previous history of mental problems.<br />From there, things go from bad to worse; Connie is forced to participate in experimental treatments in order to ever go home, because no one really wants her anywhere.  The state doesn't care, her family doesn't care, and the one man who loved her is dead.  (Her daughter is either in foster care or has been adopted out.)<br />She makes contact with the future and manages to use those brief glimpses to continue to hope and fight her situation.  She pretends to acquiesce, but is in actuality looking for a way out -- if it'll only present itself.<br />The subplot about the evil future, to me at least, is a metaphor.  There are always choices.  Even the best choice can lead to ill; you can only minimize the consequences.<br />At any rate, Connie's situation is appalling.  Her only true friends are those in her head -- those from the future.  Yet she continues to care about the present, despite having almost nobody or nothing care about her except as an object.<br />Anyway, Ms. Piercy does not normally write s/f.  Her world-building skills, compared to contemporary s/f authors, are not what most s/f readers look for.  There aren't elaborate scenes sketched; there aren't large amounts of technology lavishly explained.<br />I feel that is irrelevant.  Ms. Piercy has enough detail of the future, both good and bad, to explain what's going on, and that's enough for me.  I liked her additional words (per for a personal pronoun, rather than he or she, for example), and I enjoyed her descriptions of how things were done in the various encampments/towns.  And really, this is a highly personal novel; it's psychological, and can be read on many levels.  That level of minutiae would only distract, not add.<br />Those who want more conventionality need to look elsewhere.<br />As it stands, I think &quot;Woman on the Edge ofTime&quot; is about love, and how it can conquer anything.  Granted, the love I'm talking about isn't about love for another -- or even self-love, although Connie does have those (especially for her daughter, who was taken away from her during her dark period).  It's about love for humanity, which is what makes it so unique in science fiction.  Ms. Piercy tackled a huge theme, and made it work.<br />There aren't anywhere near enough stars to give this work, so I'll just say five stars plus, with the highest recommendation possible.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-09-11

She's not perfect; she'd rather not be undertaking this quest, thank you very much, and doesn't understand what she's doing.  I like that part just fine.<br />But I'll tell you something.  I read about two hundred, two hundred fifty pages in, and stopped dead for two weeks.  I started up again, and called every plot twist from there on in.<br />Granted, that's not necessarily a failing.  I'm a writer myself, and a decent editor, and am well versed with fantasy convention.  But I was hoping that one thing -- just one -- would surprise me.  And it didn't.<br />Even the ending, where Karigan refuses to become a Green Rider, isn't all that surprising; she ran from being the heroine most of the way through, why change there?  Besides, it was just an unconventional way to get into a sequel; more power to Ms. Britain for thinking of it, but I don't find it amazingly original.<br />Basically, this is a readable fantasy with some mightily cliched elements.  Because it's a first novel, many people have given it more stars than it perhaps deserves.  But based on the modern classics in the field (Lackey, Edghill, Donaldson, Bujold, Jordan, Goodkind), it isn't worth that.  It's a solid effort which shows enough for another novel.<br />I'll try the second book once it gets into paperback (or if I can find the hardcover at the library); granted, I buy very, very few hardcovers.  If I like that better, Ms. Britain's third novel might be something I highly anticipate.<br />But right now, I can take or leave this series.<br />Two and a half stars.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-09-06
US	32010417	RKAVFPTQPUHRQ	1892065061	223011024	Queen of Denial	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Hilarious four and a half star debut	Selina Rosen has a winning effort in &quot;Queen of Denial.&quot;  The plot is fairly easy to sum up; Drewcila Quah has been a Salvager for many years.  She's good at it; she drinks hard, loves hard, and swears a whole lot, as the other Salvagers do.<br />However, there's a secret in her past that is about to be revealed; seems that she's the missing Queen of an important planet.  Her husband waited five years to come after her; now, he's found her.<br />The sparks fly, but not the way he wants.  The King, Zarco, is a very boring guy; he's done a whole lot of warring, he slept with Drew's sister Stasha, and he's not a very nice guy at all in my opinion.  Drew, even with all her swearing, bedding and other stuff, is the sympathetic one.<br />I really liked Drew; she's extremely funny.  Her partner the alien is also amusing, and they interact well together.  Her sister Stasha is also played for laughs, and is much more sympathetic than any other character in this book other than Drew.<br />Thing is, plot alone is not the reason to read this.  The reason to read it is because it's absolutely, positively hilarious.  There are many laugh out loud moments here, too many to list, and the _only_ real drawback is that the frontispiece for the novel (the initial page, explaining things) has a whole lot of punctuation and spelling errors.  I don't completely understand this; how did it get through one printing that way, much less multiple printings?<br />Never mind.  Ignore that page.  The rest is extremely good.<br />So, the final tally is four and a half stars, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-09-06
US	32010417	R3N6BLKD1W2OLH	1592220134	472773078	Low Port	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Four and a half star anthology	&quot;Low Port&quot; is a winning effort.  The premise is intriguing; what actually happens below decks on a ship?  Or in the places most books never bother to delve into?<br />There are many, many stories here.  But to me, the best one was &quot;Riis Run,&quot; by eluki bes shahar.  This is a sort of prequel to her critically acclaimed &quot;Hellflower&quot; universe, featuring the same two main characters, and also features the patois Ms. bes shahar had made up for those books.<br />The story behind this one goes along with the overarching premise in the &quot;Hellflower&quot; trilogy, which is that sometimes it's better to die than to live as something other than what you are.  And that some knowledge carries too high a price; thing is, the price should still be offered to be paid.<br />I know I'm not explaining this anywhere near as well as Ms. bes shahar did.  Never mind.  Let's just say that it's a great story, very well told.<br />The other stories that I really, truly enjoyed were Ru Emerson's &quot;Find a Pin,&quot; which talked about the last day of a homeless woman's life -- and her daughter's search for meaning, and John Teehan's &quot;Digger Don't Take No Requests, which talked about busking, buskers, and their subculture on a space station.  Teehan's was particularly interesting, in that it showed that many people, not just technical sorts, will want to go to space.  How do we accommodate them?<br />Several other stories were good, but were not up to the standard of the previous three.  &quot;Angel's Kitchen&quot; by Chris Szego had an interesting idea that went on a bit too long for me; Sharon Lee's &quot;Gonna Boogie with Granny Time&quot; was a fun story about loss and potential redemption, but it took a long time to develop.  (Granted, I can't think of a better way, myself, to explain this idea.  It's just that, up until the last two pages of the story, I really thought the main bad guy had bought his way free of retribution.  And he did, too; thing is, he'd bought his way into a worse retribution than he could have realized.)<br />Every story here is meaningful and has value and worth; that's rare in an anthology.  Which is why I give it a four and a half star recommendation; five stars for the first three stories, strong fours for the rest, rounded up.<br />Final tally:  four and a half stars, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-09-06

It gets everything right, from the science to the psychology to the anthropology -- everything works.<br />The plot is somewhat difficult to describe.  Tocohl Susumo is a ship captain, trader, and bon vivant; her sentient computer Margaret, Lord Lynn is her sole companion.<br />At the Festival of Saint Veschke on the world of Sheveschkem, Tocohl finds danger, mystery, intrigue . . . and maybe even a hint of scandal.  She goes to Lassti to find out whether or not a new race of beings, the sprookjes, are sentient -- or aren't.<br />There's a whole lot more to it; it's a comedy of manners, a comedy of language, and a hint of romance among Tocohl and Om Im Chadeayne helps to spice the mix.  (The romance between Alfvaen and swift-Kalat does even more along these lines.)<br />I wish I knew how to describe this book better.  All I can say is that I enjoy it for the language, the sense of humor, the mystery, the intrigue, the conflict, and everything else besides.<br />Five stars plus, recommended.<br />Oh yeah, and if you like this, you'll probably like the other couple of books Ms. Kagan has written -- &quot;Mirabile&quot; and &quot;Uhura's Song&quot; -- as well as works by Steve Miller and Sharon Lee, Lois Bujold, and possibly David Weber.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-08-09

This was Mercedes Lackey's first book about Elemental magic, and in my opinion, her best of the three (so far).<br />Rose is a scholar in a bad bind; her father's just died, her money is gone, the creditors are howling at the door, and she has few options and almost no hope.<br />Enter Jason Cameron.  He's a man with a bad problem of his own; because of extreme hubris, he attempted a spell to turn him into a werewolf.  It didn't totally work, but the partial working has left him tired, ill, injured and feeling almost without hope himself.<br />Cameron needs a scholar who can translate old manuscripts, because only those manuscripts have the potential to help them, and because of his disability, he can no longer read them himself.  Rose is a scholar who can read almost anything (she talks of reading Ovid, Sappho's poems, the Decameron, etc.) in just about any language, which is why he wants her help.  The two of them link up, and find a most unusual love.<br />Other than that, I don't want to give away the plot; they obviously face trials and tribulations on the road to a fuller realization of their love, but if I talk about them, I'll definitely spoil this unusual and unique story.<br />So all I'll say is, &quot;Read this book for yourself!&quot;<br />Five stars.  Recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />Oh, and if you've tried &quot;Gates of Sleep&quot; and didn't like it (I didn't, although I enjoyed &quot;Serpent's Shadow&quot; well enough), you might like this.

It's intensely psychological, a fast moving space opera drama that gets everything right -- everything.<br />The story is as follows.  Miles Naismith Vorkosigan, galactic mercenery and reluctant Vor lord, had tried in &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; to give his clone brother Mark a start in life.  But Mark couldn't get free of Miles, no matter how he tried; this was because of psychological damage and because of intense psychosocial programming by renegade terrorists (who had ordered Mark cloned to make him substitute for Miles).  Before Miles showed up, Mark had no identity -- his whole purpose was to take over Miles' life.  But Miles changed that.  Somewhat.<br />The start of &quot;Mirror Dance&quot; has Mark back; he has found out about some clones about to be killed in clone brain transplants.  He's extremely sensitive to this, and wants to stop it.  However, because of his damage, he doesn't believe that anyone will help him -- not Miles, not his family (who he doesn't realize would care), not anyone.<br />So, he steals one of Miles' mercenary ships, and goes hunting.  He frees most of the clones, but ends up killing Miles (who goes down to rescue Mark -- again).<br />The first time I read this (all in the first hundred pages, so this isn't a spoiler), I threw the book across the room.  I didn't care for Mark, and I wanted Miles to live.<br />However, in the next three hundred pages, I came to care desperately for Mark.  He meets Cordelia, his mother -- a formidable ex-ship's captain.  And he meets Aral, his father -- a formidable Prime Minister, ex-ship's captain, and Admiral of Barrayar.<br />His father has a health crisis, while everyone tries to find Miles.  Death is not irrevocable in the far future; Miles might be able to be brought back.  And Mark feels extremely responsible for Miles' death; if Miles hadn't gone after him, he'd be alive (even if Mark himself would be dead).<br/>I don't want to go into the rest, but trust me, you'll want to read it.  Because Mark's journey of identity is compelling, believable, honest, heart-wrenching, and sad.  Tremendously sad.<br />After all is said and done, Mark not only became likable -- he became my favorite Bujold character.  That's because he's so complex, and he wants to do the right thing -- even though he doesn't always know what it is, nor how to achieve it.<br />There's a bit of Mark in all of us.<br />In addition, Mark's struggles with his weight and with depression hit close to home as well.  Despite crushing despair and a nearly overwhelming amount of self-hatred, Mark perseveres.<br />And eventually, Mark wins.  He even gets the girl.<br />This is my favorite Bujold book for many reasons; the language is crisp, the characterizations are right on the money, the science is believable, the logic and the plot make sense, and the psychology of it all is understandable.<br />This book should give hope to anyone who's gifted but in a bad situation; in my opinion, it also should be required reading for people struggling with depression, multiple personalities, and schizophrenia, because Bujold did her homework and got the issues _right_.<br />This is one of my all time favorite books, and I believe it is destined to go down as a classic of the s/f genre.<br />Five stars plus, highly recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-08-02

What I see in a Bujold/Miller and Lee comparison would be closer to Bujold's \\"Mirror Dance\\" -- a psychological drama in which everything the hero knows is questioned, and he comes to a greater meaning and understanding of himself and his circumstances by throwing \\"traditional\\" conduct out the window.<br />Er Thom yos'Galan, like Mark Vorkosigan in \\"Mirror Dance\\", feels like a lesser human being.  His chalaket, Daav yos'Phelium, is brilliant, sexy, good looking -- everything Er Thom feels he isn't.<br />Anne Davis, however, sees Er Thom differently.  Anne is a scholar, and is fully Human, whereas Er Thom is Liaden (a mutant offshoot of the human race with additional psychic abilities).  What Er Thom sees as liabilities (for example, his inability to go along with polyamory, or a succession of short term contract marriages to get heirs, because he's a natural monogamist), Anne sees as assets.<br />Of course, their relationship is rocky at the start.  He believes because she's Terran (or fully human), his mother won't approve -- and indeed, when his mother meets her later, she doesn't.  And because of that, and because of his mother's inability to see Er Thom's monogamist nature -- and the fact that Er Thom and Anne Davis have a lifemating (a sacred bond that most Liadens recognize, even though Er Thom's mother doesn't), fur flies.  Repeatedly.<br />The s/f here is mostly in the trappings, but I don't see that as bad or wrong.  For one, in a story like this, how do you get polar opposites like Er Thom and Anne believe themselves to be at first?  (Because they're looking at externals, not internals.)  The easiest way, in a far future romance, is to have one or the other be a Trader -- and that's what Er Thom is.<br />Plus, the s/f background is very strong; it works.<br />But this is a _psychological_ novel, more so than any other of Lee and Miller's novels.  It's psychological, because it's all in how Anne Davis sees herself, how she sees Er Thom -- and vice versa.  Their son, Shan, has a role to play, too.<br />Most of the rest of the plot, to me, is a McGuffin.  It helps to illustrate the main tension, which is this: how can these two, who are of different worlds, find a way to be together happily?<br />This is a cross cultural paradigm, and it's done extremely well.  Obviously Miller and Lee have done their anthropological homework; they know what happens to various people in different cultures when they meet up, especially when one offshoot (in this case, the Liadens) meets up with the main branch (in this case, the Terrans).<br />Better yet, I firmly believed in Anne Davis' characterization, and in Er Thom's.  I saw their dilemma and their solution; of course, it was easier for me outside the book to say (actually, to yell at them), \\"Be with each other and ignore these other idiots!\\"  <br />But in the real world, that isn't always easy in a cross-culture romance.  Miller and Lee did right to make it tough here.<br />So, the final tally is five stars, recommended.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />And if you like this book, you probably will like most anything else Miller and Lee have written; in addition, you might like Lois Bujold's work as well, as there are some similarities.	2003-08-02

Because Butterfly is in love with her former ship's computer, an Artificial Intelligence (actually a very old, very proscribed Library), Paladin, she has no interest in Valijon.  (And Valijon is too young for Butterfly anyway; he's only barely past puberty, whereas she's in her 30s.)<br />Taking the love interest out makes the rest of the story stronger, oddly enough, and it becomes a story about the following things:<br />What is the truth?<br />Can we believe our leaders?<br />Will absolute power always corrupt?<br />Can people change?<br />It's not every story that can do this.  And when a story can, especially over 12 years after it was originally released (at least, the first story, \\"Hellflower,\\" was released in 1991, I think), maybe it isn't too much to call this a classic series.<br />I definitely believe that the Hellflower trilogy should be recommended reading for people new to s/f -- because it shows the potential of the genre to explore new ideas, and old ideas in a new setting, in an unusual and provocative way.<br />Five stars.  Highly recommended.<br />And let's hope some publisher with some sense out there will ask Ms. shahar to reprint these books.  Please!	2003-07-31

Her son, Daystar, is the hero of this book (and no, Cimorene is not the confused heroine; we'll meet her in a bit), and he really doesn't know what's going on.  He's been raised to be polite, learned a bit of magic, and has been a good son to Cimorene . . .but is ignorant of his heritage, his destiny, and anything else -- and is ignorant on purpose.  (Cimorene has denied him for reasons of her own.)<br />When a wizard shows up and threatens his mother, Cimorene calmly melts the wizard, then sends Daystar off on a quest.  She gives him a sword, tells him to go to the Enchanted Forest and find his destiny, and to be quick about it.  Because Daystar is polite, he doesn't question this, although he does find it more than a bit odd.<br />So, 16 year old Daystar goes off to find his fortune in the enchanted forest, and gets more and more confused.  He meets up with Shiara, a fire witch (the flawed heroine), who is not a totally nice person.  She is instead a very fiery young lady, and is tired of people patronizing her.  The main problem she has is that she should be more powerful than she is; her magic is not under control, and she has no idea how to control it, either.  Which is why she's in the Enchanted Forest; it's sort of a last ditch attempt for her to find out how to use her gifts responsibly, while getting away from people who don't seem to understand her at all.<br />As Daystar figures out what he's supposed to be doing, Shiara also figures out her own role in things.  By the end, after a series of adventures, Daystar and Shiara realize they might just mean more to each other than they thought.<br />As usual, Ms. Wrede satirizes just about every fantasy and fairy tale convention under the sun, and does it with great flair.  In addition, she writes in a clear, unaffected style, which renders the sarcasm and satire even more delightful than if they were presented in a different way.<br />Five stars for this great book.  Here's hoping Ms. Wrede will think of some more adventures for Daystar, Shiara, Cimorene, and Mendanbar.	2003-07-15

And I'm not sure what it is.  It's not wit; this book is as witty as the others.  It's not charm; it's very charming in spots.  And it's certainly not the satire, as this is just as satirical as the others.<br />Perhaps it tries too hard.  I know that has to sound rather odd, but bear with me.  One character Cimorene and Morwen meet up with on their travels is a rabbit named Killer.  Killer dyes his hair; now, _that's_ funny!  But after that, Killer goes through a gauntlet of problems, getting dyed blue, turning into a donkey, then a donkey with huge ears that floats, etc.  Basically, Killer's a one-joke character, whose joke goes a little stale. ...... <br />I'd rather have read more about Morwen's cats, as they made chapter one extremely enjoyable.  Or about Morwen and Telemain's unusual relationship.  Or a bit more about how Cimorene and Mendanbar get along.<br />Still, average Wrede beats many other authors.  And this is a great series.<br />However, I read book 4 without book 3 and figured things out just fine (because I couldn't _find_ book 3); maybe others would be able to navigate the jump between book 2 and 4 as well.  I'm not sure.<br />So, I'd give this three stars, and recommend it because of the series, not because of this book by itself.	2003-07-15

My favorite story was \\"Utensile Strength,\\" which featured the gang from Ms. Wrede's \\"Enchanted Forest Chronicles.\\"  Queen Cimorene is back, and back with a vengeance; she has to be one of my favorite characters in all fiction.

It's not much like other stuff Diana Wynne Jones has written; although there are humorous moments, it's decidedly not lighthearted, it's not written in a straightforward manner (as it's instead written in five sections), and the time-sense of the novel is rather skewed.<br />No matter.  This is one of the few books I've read cover to cover, then turned back to re-read immediately.  I did that for two reasons; Ms. Jones' use of language is extremely moving, especially when talking about Mordion and Vierran's halting romance, and I really wanted to figure out what this whole odd time sense thing was all about.<br />The main reason the novel is written in five parts is to keep you guessing; it's an intellectual puzzle that's almost impossible to describe.  The simple stuff is that there really are people behind the scenes controlling everything on Earth (and in the galaxy as a whole), people called Reigners.  They're not very nice people; Reigner One is particularly offensive.  And they've co-opted many other, better people to act in their stead as enforcers, crippling them emotionally in the process.<br />I enjoyed figuring out the twists and turns of the most convoluted plotline I've ever read, while I reveled in how Ms. Jones managed to show people who were emotionally shell-shocked from years of abuse find love, laughter and meaning despite it all.<br />Five stars, highly recommended for anyone with a good amount of patience and a love for mysteries.	2003-07-10

His new father, Thought Admiral Kethas, is a brilliant war strategist who's also unsurpassed at the game of klin zha, the Klingon board game which is similar to, but not exactly like, chess.<br />Kethas schemes to get Vrenn into the Academy, and sends him off.  While Vrenn's on a ship, he gets promoted two ranks due to bravery in combat.  Just as he's about to enjoy some well deserved shore leave, he's taken aside for &quot;questioning&quot; by security officers.<br />It seems his father, the Thought Admiral, was a traitor.  Or so they say.<br />The rest of the book mostly deals with Vrenn (turned Krenn after he makes Captain) and how he finds out the truth about his parentage, how he forges a friendship with the first Ambassador to the Klingon Empire, Emanuel Tagore, and how he finds his own style of happiness and love -- which isn't that close to human style happiness and love at all.<br />This was written far before the Next Generation series; Krenn isn't a Next Gen Klingon.  He's not even that close to an original series Klingon, except for the passing resemblance between him and Captain Koloth (&quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;).  But Krenn is honorable, even if he's not human, and the frame story Mr. Ford came up with around Krenn's story is astonishingly original.  It's not just one frame story (that of Kirk and company reading the novel about Krenn), it's _two_, as John M. Ford himself explains _why_ he wrote this novel, and about how he's afraid the Federation might just try to stop publication due to sensitive stuff he found out in the researching of the novel.  Very, very well done.<br />This, without a doubt, is the best Star Trek novel of all time -- and it's also one of the best science fiction novels _ever_ about an alien culture, and how tough it'd be for a &quot;first contact&quot; to work even if all parties want it.  I've read other stuff by Mr. Ford, and it's uniformly excellent; this, however, transcends it all, and is one of the truly classic novels of the twentieth century in my opinion.<br />Five stars plus, and with the highest recommendation possible.	2003-07-10

Janet Kagan wrote a great book here; if it hadn't been about Star Trek, maybe she would have been up for the John W. Campbell award, because this apparently was her very first novel.<br />Couldn't prove it by me, as it's uniformly excellent stuff.<br />&quot;Uhura's Song&quot; is touching, funny, sensitive, and sad -- it talks of serious subjects in humorous ways (mostly) and doesn't devalue them in the process.  It's engaging, irreverent at times, and an extremely good read.<br />The best thing about this book is how true Ms. Kagan was to the characterization of the original Trek characters.  Mr. Scott sounds like himself, irascible and concerned by turns, a gifted engineer and part-time bon vivant.  Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock sound true to life without getting in the way of the plot, which is carried by Lt. Uhura, new Dr. Evan Wilson, and the Eeiouans Brightspot and Jinx.<br />If you enjoy your books well thought out, well plotted, action and suspense filled while still finding ways to have humorous interludes, this book is for you.<br />Five stars, highly recommended.  Oh, and buy Ms. Kagan's other books, too; &quot;Hellspark&quot; in particular is one of my favorites, all time.  I really hope she'll write a sequel to that one of these days!	2003-07-10

It's very hard to explain.  I'm not sure I can, but here goes.<br />Elspeth and Darkwind matured a whole lot in book two, coming to work together and fall in love.  I believed in that love story, and I believed in how well they worked together.  I also believed in the destruction of Mornelithe Falconsbane, the more or less eternal enemy (from the &quot;Gryphon&quot; trilogy to the &quot;Mage Storms&quot; trilogy) who's set most of the overarching plot in motion.<br />However, in this book, &quot;Winds of Fury,&quot; Falconsbane comes back to life, and we now find out he's had a Shin'a'in apprentice-shaman sitting in his head the whole time.  (Well, An'desha had run off to learn magecraft, but if he'd have stayed in his clan, he'd have been a shaman.)  I can't totally buy that, even though Ms. Lackey did it well and I like An'desha very much as a character.<br />Same with Nyara, Skif and Need (Nyara's new sword).  They meet up with Vanyel and Stefen in the Forest of Sorrows (along with Elspeth, Darkwind, Firesong, and their Companions), which is very nice -- but it definitely came out of the blue.  And although I loved seeing Vanyel and especially Stefen again (Stefen was one of my all-time favorite characters), I am just uncertain if they totally fit in here.<br />Finally, when Elspeth steps away from the throne of Valdemar to become the head of the Herald-mages, that makes sense.  But having Queen Selenay take the news so calmly isn't; Selenay was close to tears at her &quot;baby&quot; leaving the nest in book one, &quot;Winds of Fate.&quot;  So, why the difference now?  More Companion pressure?  And if so, why wasn't it shown?<br />I agree that every mother finds a moment when they realize their child is now an adult, but I still find it hard to believe in this particular moment for that revelation.<br />The rest of the plot, wherethey take on Ancar (who holds Falconsbane, thus also holding the captive An'desha), I don't want to get into; that's for you to discover.  And I think you'll enjoy it; it's very quick paced, funny in spots (Ms. Lackey does gallows-humor rather well), and the romances of Darkwind/Elspeth, Skif/Nyara and Treyvan/Hydona (the gryphons) work extremely well.<br />So, despite the somewhat off-true &quot;Winds of Fate,&quot; I'd recommend this trilogy (even including that book, or the rest of it makes no sense at all), even though I do not feel it's Ms. Lackey's best work.  To find better reads penned by Ms. Lackey, read &quot;Oathbreakers,&quot; &quot;By the Sword,&quot; Exile's Honor,&quot; or the Last Herald-mage trilogy about Vanyel Ashkevron.  Those are deeper, richer and more realistic reads, which is why I give this book 3.5 stars out of five, as well as 3 stars overall for the trilogy.  (The others all rated five stars.)	2003-07-04

Sorry, couldn't resist the pun, but \\"Summon the Keeper\\" is a keeper of a book.  It's light, witty, refreshing, satirical, and honest -- a tough combination to pull off.  Yet Tanya Huff does it well, and keeps the plot moving along well.<br />Most of the plot of this book, I feel, is a MacGuffin.  The real depth of the book comes from the unforeseen passion between Claire (a Keeper) and Dean (a much younger man, and a Bystander).  Normally, Keepers and Bystanders do not mix, as Bystanders often have the wool pulled over both their literal and figurative eyes because of what the Keepers do.<br />Simply put, a Keeper puts his or her life on the line to maintain balance between good and evil.  So Claire, the Keeper being \\"summoned\\" to take charge of an incident, has a great deal of power to wield, yet the power is sharply limited.<br />And falling in love with anyone, much less a non-magical Bystander, was definitely not part of Claire's equation.  What happens next includes pitfalls of romance, magic, sporting events, current events, cat-human relations, and many other things. Ms. Huff satirizes them all with great aplomb, and I enjoyed her wittiness as much as it appears she did while writing it.<br />This book is hilariously funny in spots, and is definitely recommended for anyone who likes humorous fantasy, semi-realistic urban fantasy, or cats mixed with their fantasy.  Five stars, recommended.	2003-07-04

It's not like the other two in Ms. Huff's universe, in that it focuses more on Diana, Claire's lesbian sister, and her tangled attempts to have a meaningful relationship.<br />In the second book, \\"The Second Summoning,\\" Diana ended up making friends with Sam, a literally fallen angel (who decided to be immediately reincarnated as a cat).  This was probably the first friend she'd ever made, as she was too powerful for her own good from an early age, and had no compunctions about using her powers to suit herself.  Her parents rather despaired of her; her sister didn't know what to think, half the time approving, half of the other time being appalled.<br />In this installment of \\"The Keeper's Chronicles,\\" Diana has finally graduated high school, meaning she can now be summoned to do Keeper work.  As she's the most powerful Keeper in the world, she's more than ready to do the work, too.<br />Or is she?  She gets out to the latest incident, a mall looking for a place to implode/explode (Huff calls it a gateway, I think, although I could be misremembering the terminology), and takes her sister with her.  Dean, Claire's boyfriend, and Austin, Claire's cat, can't go with her (although Austin tries, but ends up getting sent back home).  So it's just Diana and Claire, trying to do their best to keep the mall from becoming a gateway to Hell.<br />Do they succeed?  Well, that's up to you to decide.<br />As for everything else, I'm a bit split on how I feel regarding Diana's romance with the punkish transformed human Kris.  Kris is bright, feisty, and attractive, but what else is pulling at Diana to make Kris be the one she fixates on?  This really isn't shown, although Diana's confusion as to whether or not it's actually OK for her to kiss Kris is done to perfection by Ms. Huff.<br />And as a few others have pointed out, Claire seems a bit like an afterthought for most of the book.  And that's wrong; Claire, Dean and Austin are the backbone of this series, and easing them out is the wrong move in my opinion.  I sincerely hope Ms. Huff doesn't do that.<br />I'd definitely recommend this book, to anyone over fifteen that likes humorous fantasy laced with satire and sarcasm.  There is a remarkable amount of strong language here, more so than in the other books of this series, and between that and the necrophilia hinted at in the relationship between the mummy and the professor, I'd rather err on the side of caution in recommending this book to anyone under fifteen (or an extremely mature kid of any age, with parental supervision).<br />As for future adventures, I'd definitely buy them.  Bring 'em on as fast as possible, Ms. Huff!	2003-07-04

In it, Claire, the Keeper from &quot;Summon the Keeper&quot; returns, along with her old and cranky cat Austin, her hunky Bystander boyfriend Dean, and a few other folks from book one.<br />The most intriguing semi-new character here was Diana, Claire's sister.  Diana is the most powerful Keeper alive, yet is still an adolescent, and her asides are pungent and earthy.  She also doesn't seem too pleased about Claire's new relationship (although Claire's own parents don't mind at all).<br />Best of all, whenever Diana shows up, the sparks really fly from both sisters, and some tremendously witty repartee ensues.<br />I very much enjoyed the further adventures of Claire and company, and hope Ms. Huff will continue to write many more inspired sequels about the characters introduced here.<br />Another very fine satirical effort; five stars, recommended.	2003-07-04

It talks about Alberich, former Captain of Karse's Guard, who was run out of Karse for having a powerful precognitive gift.  In Karse, no one outside of the priesthood of Vkandis is allowed to have magic, either mind-magic (such as Alberich's) or actual magic.  Yet not everyone knows they have such early on, and when they do find out, it's not always expedient to leave where you're at.<br />As Alberich was common born at best, raising to the Captaincy of the Guard was about all he thought he could do.<br />But after the Karsites run him out (he's saved by a Companion, who bonds with him not long after), what can he do to save his honor?  Bad enough he's bonded with a Companion, one he's believed all his life to be a demon; now he's part of Valdemar, the heretic nation full of fools and disbelievers?<br />How can he retain his honor, when everything he thought he knew is being questioned?  That is the fundamental point of this novel, and Ms. Lackey answers it fully: by being yourself, always.  And by not giving up.  And by continuing to learn about yourself and others, even if you do think it's a no-win scenario.<br />Once again, as in &quot;By the Sword,&quot; Ms. Lackey has written a realistic, accurate picture of life during wartime -- and what happens when defectors are taken in.  It's a modern parable, as well as a diverting fantasy.<br />Read this impressive book for yourself.  Highly recommended for anyone over the age of twelve or so (as some of the battle scenes might be a bit graphic, else).	2003-07-03

In Patricia C. Wrede's universe, most Princesses are deadly dull sorts, fit only to be rescued by the even more deadly dull heroes.  And Princess Cimorene (princess by courtesy and convention, not by aptitude, as she's smart, funny, and her own person) wants none of it.<br />She runs off, and apprentices herself (more or less) to Kazul, an imposing female Dragon.  Yet she and Kazul find they have much in common; razor-like wit, uncommon sense, and the ability to enjoy fine cooking (which Cimorene discovers she's not too bad at cooking, either).<br />Some wizards show up and emperil their existence; Cimorene and Kazul don't care for this too much.  How they fight them is up to you to figure out; trust me, you'll want to know the ending.<br />Thing is, it's the wit and the style that carries this book.  It's hilarious; Ms. Wrede goes out of her way to satirize convention, yet gently and with great care.  The mix of gentility and satirization makes for loads of laughs and fun.<br />As for recommendations, I think anyone who's read a lot of fairy tales or is at least in the fifth or sixth grade (about age 10 or so) will enjoy this.  Adults, however, will probably enjoy this just as much as the kids, if not more so.  I did.	2003-07-03
US	32010417	R12QBOR5PSNVRW	0449215865	676376282	Turkish Delight	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very good debut Regency	I enjoy just about everything Rosemary Edghill has written (whether under this name, or her nom de plume eluki bes shahar), and \\"Turkish Delight,\\" a novel I recently bought through [Amazon.com's] used books division, was very tempting indeed.<br />The basic plot is as follows.  Louisa Darwen's family died while overseas in Turkey; a Sultan adopted her (as he liked her and her family).  She was raised in the harem, learned Turkish and the religion of the Muslims, and now is returning to England to take up her inheritance (such as it is).<br />Gervase, Earl of Coldmeece, is an unusual fellow.  He's thirty-five, still unwed, has an unusual, strange sense of humor -- and dislikes Louisa without even meeting her, because of her unusual background.<br />With this sort of set-up, of course sparks are going to fly, and of course these two are going to end up together.  Yet the journey here is more important than the outcome; Louisa is very funny, especially when she's chatting with other Darwens, and Gervase is also extremely amusing.<br />This was Ms. Edghill's debut novel, and it already showed the great promise she had (and still has) as a novelist; the dialogue is crisp and witty, the situations crackle with life and don't seem quite as contrived as other Regencies I've read, and Gervase is a most unusual hero.<br />I really enjoy Ms. Edghill's Regencies, because they are always amusing, funny, and touching.  Still, my favorite of her Regencies remains \\"Two of a Kind.\\"  That one was even more unusual than this, and is even funnier in some ways.  I've also read another of her Regencies, \\"The Ill-Bred Bride,\\" which was also a bit better than this one in some ways.<br />But this was a debut novel; I doubt I'd have written one half so well, and as it stands, I'm talking about it nearly twenty years after it was released, and after reading nearly all of Ms. Edghill's subsequent output.  So, on that basis, I'd say this was a solid four star effort -- and showed much of what would come later.<br />Buy all the Rosemary Edghill books you can!  You won't regret it. :)	2003-07-03
US	32010417	R156BWBV4FXX21	1568650485	173624356	Butterfly and Hellflower	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Actually, four and a half stars	\\"Butterfly and Hellflower\\" is a very unusual series; it contains three books by eluki bes shahar (aka Rosemary Edghill), starting with \\"Hellflower,\\" continuing with \\"Darktraders,\\" and finishing with \\"Archangel Blues.\\"<br />I've read through about the first half of it, and it's excellent.  Lots of interesting things, most not seen in other s/f much if at all, including a plot where knowledge not only can corrupt but _has_ corrupted before, so people are still mostly dead set against it (which is why the sentient Libraries were outlawed in the first place); interdicted barbarian worlds where slavery is not only tolerated, it's legislated; mercenaries who have a greater sense of honor and moral courage than most ruling elites, and are dedicated to keeping the sentient Libraries _out_ of power; and much more.<br />Butterfly is a tough, proud ship Captain, someone who's clawed her way out of obscurity and has taken the only way open to her.  She's learned as she's gone, and forged a partnership with one of the interdicted Libraries -- which has also grown, changed and become more \\"human\\" because of her influence.<br />The main Hellflower in question is Valijon Starbringer; he's young, impetuous, and very honor-bound.  And he doesn't know what to make of Butterfly.<br />They go through a series of adventures (as I said, there've been quite a number already, a book and a half in), and Butterfly has to examine many of her most precious principles in the process, including her (formerly well suppressed) maternal instinct.<br />Although it's a relatively minor quibble, I don't think this book has quite the weight of Ms. Edghill's later-released work.  Yet I've read other books by other writers such as William Gibson and Bruce Sterling that did this premise (or a similar one, without the libraries) post-cyberpunk, and they were praised much more than Ms. Edghill, and had greater sales.<br />Go figure.<br />At any rate, I enjoyed this book far more than I enjoyed \\"Neuromancer\\"or \\"The Difference Engine\\" or any of Gibson or Sterling's work.  I also enjoyed this more than most of the military science fiction I've read that depended on technology, meaning I enjoyed this more than S.N. Lewitt, S.L. Viehl, the later Anne McCaffrey books about the Brain Ships, etc.<br />So, while this book will probably not stand as a classic in the genre, it definitely stands as a book that's as well worth reading as the day it came out, nearly twelve years ago.  Highly recommended for anyone above age fourteen or so (as anyone younger probably won't understand much of the convoluted plot).	2003-07-03
US	32010417	R3SEKVNYM98KUW	0886776228	36453099	The Sword of Maiden's Tears (Twelve Treasures)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Good &quot;Maiden&quot; voyage	&quot;The Sword of Maiden's Tears&quot; is an unusual crossover novel.  It's urban fantasy mixed with horror, but done satirically, and done with great flair by Rosemary Edghill (definitely one of my favorite writers).<br />It's rare to see urban fantasy done with humor, although it happens.  I've almost never seen horror done with humor, so mixing the three together was a very nice touch.<br />The character that struck me the most was Michael, an ex-cop graduate student in library science.  (Well, all the friends are studying to be librarians, and none of them are truly suited to it.)  Michael has a depth, weight and richness to him that makes me wonder what happens to him after this novel; as I've skim-read the next two in the series, so far Michael has not reappeared.  I'm hopeful that at some point, Ms. Edghill will find a way to write a book about him, because that man still has much to say.<br />As for Ruth, the titular heroine, and Melior, the titular hero, they aren't usual by anyone's standards.  Melior is either a raving lunatic or an obsessed fanatic, take your pick; he's likable because he doesn't want the Earth to disappear (even though he doesn't like New York at all), and it will if the grendel-thing isn't stopped, and because of his nearly instantaneous passion for Ruth.<br />Ruth, however, is a bit of a cipher.  She spent eight years in a coma, is now biologically thirty but acts much younger and has almost no self-confidence and little to no experience in dating (as she spent almost all her time since &quot;awakening&quot; in school, preparing to become a librarian).  She's smart, tough, and witty, but there's something just a bit off about her . . . something that is disclosed in the contents of &quot;Sword of Maiden's Tears.&quot;<br />The others of the circle of friends include Naomi, a sort of earth mother who cooks, cleans and mother hens everyone within reach; Jane, who's another character I'd dearly love to find out about, as she's young, smart, tough, nobody's fool, and trying her best despite not believing much in herself; and Philip, a computer hacker with much agita and angst, who sticks around mainly because he likes Naomi and wants to figure out what the rest of them will do next.<br />There are several ways to interpret this book; in a way, it's like Maeve Binchy's &quot;Circle of Friends,&quot; except done in 1980s New York amongst a bunch of library students, rather than in Ireland in the 1950s.  The relationships and interrelationships between the students and Melior are what makes this novel; what adds immeasurably to it is the wittiness and sarcasm that permeates this book.<br />This isn't Ms. Edghill's best book; that one remains (in my opinion) the recently released &quot;Vengeance of Masks.&quot;  It's also not quite as good as the Bast novels, and I'd rate it a shade below &quot;The Warslayer,&quot; too.<br />But there's much to recommend it.  It's humorous, good natured, witty, and engaging; what else can you ask for, really, when you're looking for entertainment?	2003-07-03

He's been doing the work of five full Herald-mages, and desperately needs some R&R.<br />Does he get it?  Well . . . no.  Not exactly.<br />But he does find out more about himself, save a neighboring kingdom, and comes to some sort of peace with himself over the lingering grief over his lover Tylendel's death (his lifemate from \\"Magic's Pawn\\").<br />The interesting thing about this book is that it dwells on how difficult dealing with family often is.  Vanyel's family doesn't like it that he's gay, and hasn't accepted it fully; his mother is still trying to press women on him, and he really doesn't like that.  (Can't say that I blame him, either.)  They also don't quite seem to know what to do with Vanyel; he's so powerful, and yet he's one of theirs, so they don't fear him . . . it's very tough for them.<br />So, while Vanyel balances as best he can amidst his not very understanding family, he discovers a few more interesting things along the way.  One, he'd badly misjudged Jervis, the armsmaster at Forst Reach (his father's seat); Jervis is a much better person than I'd ever given him credit for in the first book (\\"Magic's Pawn\\"), and sincerely wants to make amends for his earlier bad behavior.<br />This was welcome, and quite unexpected.<br />The second is that women can still be turned by a fair face and a handsome body, even if they know you're gay.  Maybe (dare I say it?) especially if they know you're gay.<br />Not a welcome revelation, to be sure.  But an honest one, and drawn from life.<br />Mercedes Lackey does extremely well drawing these insights, from how families treat their own when they love but do not understand, to the overall treatment of gay men and women in society.  In Valdemar, there may indeed by \\"no one, true way\\" but there is still a range of behavior -- and, sadly, gay men and women aren't totally accepted everywhere even there.<br />As for why it gets only four stars, rather than five?  Well, one character, Melenna, really makes me grit my teeth when she shows up.  And I'm not so keen on Herald Lores' behavior, either (you'll have to read it to understand); put them both together and they lessen my enjoyment of the book by a bit.<br />But I still enjoy the book, no question.  Lackey shows the best -- and worst -- facets of being young, attractive, powerful, and gay -- in this book, which is why I recommend it highly.	2003-07-03

Throughout the books, Eric Banyon (the bard in question) has grown, changed, and become a better person.  He started out as a sort of young, angry-at-the-world kid, and has now matured into an older, more thoughtful and introspective man, without losing his ironic look on life or losing any of his earlier appeal.  This is tough to do; I applaud Mercedes Lackey for doing it (as she started the series, and has continued it).<br />Rosemary Edghill is the co-writer for this book, a direct sequel to \\"Beyond World's End.\\"  Eric's trying to learn how to teach Bardcraft; he takes in a young student, Hosea, for training -- even though Eric is a flutist and Hosea plays the banjo.  Thing is, once he gets Hosea back to his place, he finds out Hosea not only has the potential for bardic magic -- he also has the potential for Guardian magic (Guardians watch over cities and countries; bards mostly influence people more directly.  Something like shades of the same thing, but the magic is normally wielded differently.)<br />There is also a subplot about the Unselidhe Sidhe (basically, the Dark Elves) and their meddling, and another subplot about Beth and Kory and their quest to have a natural child together.  This isn't as easy at it might appear at first; Elves and humans normally do not crossbreed, and need magical assistance.<br />While there's lots of derring-do being derring-done (and done quite well), the main points of interest are Eric and his relationship with his new apprentice bard, Hosea, the reappearance of Kayla from earlier books,  and the subplot about Beth and Kory (one of the earliest books showed their romance, which at the time seemed very star-crossed and miserable; nice to see things have settled down a mite for them).<br />In addition, most of the people drawn as evil aren't totally such (making it a bit more understandable to see how they trick mortal followers; they play on the instinct mortals have to believe in the best of anyone).<br />And there's a lot of witty by-play throughout, further enlivening the story.<br />I think Ms. Lackey and Ms. Edghill did a very good, thorough job here; it's a highly satisfactory sequel, which makes me want the next book, \\"Mad Maudlin,\\" all the more.<br />Five stars. Recommended.	2003-07-02

She's Kethry's granddaughter (Kethry, as you might recall from the \\"Oath\\" books, was the mage partner of Tarma the Shin'a'in), yet grows up mostly ignorant of her heritage.  That's because her mother dies young, her father is an idiot, and Kerowyn's been left to rule the roost at the ripe old age of 15.<br />As her brother is being married off, also at a young age, bandits come in and disrupt the festivities.  They carry her brother Lordan's new wife off, kill her father, and murder many others on the way out.  This inflames Kerowyn, who vows revenge.<br />Going to put on her brother's cast-off armor and grabbing a dagger, she's stopped by a rather mysterious woman on the way to see her grandmother.  (Yes, she's so ignorant that she doesn't recognize Tarma, nor her significance in her grandmother's life.)  She's warned to go back; this inflames Kerowyn still further.<br />Kerowyn goes to Kethry and tells her what's happened; Kethry passes along her sword Need -- which basically is a sort of magical guardian spirit.  If you're a mage, it gives you ultimate fighting prowess.  If you're a fighter, it gives you immunity against magic.<br />Kerowyn rides, finds the bandits, kills them, and brings Lordan's bride home.  However, after she gets there, she realizes she's not cut out for the life of a noblewoman (they are of the minor nobility); she goes back to her grandmother and asks for more help.<br />At this point, Tarma steps in, and trains Kerowyn to fight.<br />The rest of the book deals with Kerowyn's training, some of her campaigns, her growing strategic and tactical prowess -- and something more.  Along the way, as she watches others pair off and feels hopelessly alone (she's gifted with Mindspeech, making it even worse, as none of her mercenary compatriots have this particular talent/affliction), she finds her soulmate, Eldan.  Who just so happens to be a Herald of Valdemar.<br />A lesser writer would have dragged Kerowyn into Valdemar at that point; wisely, Lackey keeps Kerowyn out, instead giving her more adventures, then finally getting Kerowyn and Eldan together in the midst of a long, bloody war.<br />As they deal with their love and duty, much happens.  (I don't want to give the rest of the plot away.)  And Kerowyn finds a way to indeed have it all, after all.<br />This is definitely one of my all-time favorite Lackey books; Ms. Lackey did an outstanding job with this one, as it is accurate, unflinchingly candid, yet still realistic without sacrificing anything in the characterization department.<br />Thing is, with someone else, Kerowyn wouldn't be so engaging.  She's a tough, smart woman who happens to like her job -- as a professional mercenary soldier and captain.  Most writers would draw her as a caricature; instead, Ms. Lackey showed Kerowyn as learning tactics, and coming to believe that people who fought wars should have ethics -- as it's bad enough as it is.<br />Five stars plus.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-27
US	32010417	R3SUWIP4G1ANOW	0886775167	19357260	Winds of Fate (The Mage Winds, Book 1)	Books	1	10	16	N	N	OK, one and a half stars	\\"Winds of Fate\\" is an extremely disappointing novel by Mercedes Lackey.  In it, she takes her previous characterization of Elspeth the princess of Valdemar from previous books (the \\"Arrows\\" trilogy, \\"By the Sword\\") and mostly tosses it out the window.  This sets up an incredibly difficult amount of suspension of disbelief in my view.<br />Many other reviewers have gone into the basic synopsis of the plot for this book.  I don't want to go into that again.  Suffice it to say that Elspeth, who's around 25 and acts much younger (more like a bratty 14 year old), despite her earlier characterization of being calm, cool and collected, instead runs off and starts acting even more like a spoiled brat than she did to begin with.<br />She meets up with Darkwind, a Tayledras mage from the Clan of K'Sheyna.  Darkwind, too, is deeply flawed in my view, as he's angry at his father (for good reason), has renounced his magecraft (for a reason that may or may not be good) and, worst of all, sleeps with someone who's not only underage by our standards (at about 17 when he, too, is at least 25), but is under his command, as he's Head of the Scouts and she's a Scout who's recently passed her apprenticeship.  This is a big no-no in my view, and I wonder why Ms. Lackey violated the trust relationship of superior to inferior, as she normally does not do this (especially if one is young and the other not so young).<br />Will Elspeth and Darkwind meet?  Of course, but what happens isn't quite as expected.  Some is good; some is very, very bad.  They meet up with Mornelithe Falconsbane, who is more or less the eternal enemy everyone faces, from Talia in the \\"Arrows\\" trilogy to Vanyel in \\"Magic's Price.\\"  They have to try to halt his expansion, while learning to like and trust the other amidst many small setbacks.<br />Btw, Elspeth has problems along the path with Skif (approximately 33); Skif, despite characterization in other books that shows him to be kind, adult and reasonably level-headed, acts in a rather hamhanded fashion and keeps throwing himself at her.  The reasons he does this are twofold: one, she's an extremely powerful potential Mage, and he's been warned by Quentin (a returning character from \\"By the Sword\\") that she could easily be taken over if not watched all the time.  Who better to watch her than a lover?  Two, he's alone and miserably lonely on the road; he doesn't speak much Trade, and he's never been out of Valdemar before.  So, while she's in her element (freedom, glorious freedom!), he hates it and clings harder to her.<br />That part is realistic.  This part is not.  He's 33 years old.  If she says, \\"No, I don't want to date you,\\" that's the end of it.  Period.  Even more so if it's, \\"No, I don't want you for my lover.  Period.\\"  And Skif, despite previous characterization that basically showed he would respect any woman who asked him to back off, doesn't do so here.  Very strange, and most offputting in my view.<br />Then, Elspeth is fighting against her own Companion, Gwena, every step of the way.  This is realistic; she's a feisty gal, and Gwena has been manipulating her for years, and Elspeth just found it out.  So it's not Elspeth's behavior I'm questioning, here; it's Gwena's.  Gwena is the _only_ companion outside of doomed Tylendel's Gala who acts in this fashion; she's high-handed, rather self-centered (especially considering she's a Companion) and insists her way is the only way there is.  It's behavior that's extremely offputting for a Companion, and although it's exactly the reaction Ms. Lackey probably wanted me to have, it leaves me cold.<br />Darkwind loses his much-younger lover, hardly seeming to care; that, too, was most offputting.  I realize the guy is cold and self-absorbed and into himself, but really, does he have to shrug off Dawnfire's loss so easily and quickly?  Not to mention callously?  (Especially considering she's underage?)<br />OK, since you probably have figured out I don't like this book at all, you might be wondering why I gave it any stars.  Here's why.  I still like Ms. Lackey's writing; if Elspeth and Skif hadn't had previously established characterizations, I would have had no problems with what they did (although I still would have thought they both were incredibly immature for their ages).  I enjoyed her Shin'a'in characters (Kra'heera, also returning from \\"By The Sword,\\" among others).  I enjoyed her Gryphon characters Treyvan, Hydona, and their gryphlets.  And I especially enjoyed Nyara, Falconsbane's daughter (who turns away from him, choosing good instead of evil) who eventually becomes Skif's lover (and next-best-thing to lifebonded mate).<br />Still.  If you've read the rest of the Heralds of Valdemar books, this book simply does not fit.  It doesn't.  It sticks out like a sore thumb.<br />Which is why in all good conscience I can only give it one and a half stars.  I do recommend it, oddly enough, because the \\"Mage Winds\\" series as a series is quite strong.  But this was a very weak opening book, and that's why the exceptionally low rating.	2003-06-27
US	32010417	R397LYPM2BDNPD	0886773245	105047575	Daughter of the Lion (Cheysuli)	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Keely is unique . . .	. . . she's a warrior, a princess, a shapechanger who, unlike her fellow Cheysuli, can take any shape whatsoever and talk with any lir (totem animal) while being bound by none (again, unlike any other Cheysuli).  But she's lonely.  Her brother Corin has gone off to rule Atvia, her other brothers Hart and Brennan are doing their own things too (ruling other kingdoms, or helping to rule), and in any event, she's miserable.<br />Topping everything off, she's about to be married off, which she hates.  She's trained, mostly in secret, to become the best warrior possible.  She fights with knife, bow, and in lir-shape; she does not want to be told she's weak in any way, shape or form.  And she most certainly doesn't want to marry, as the only marriages and long term relationships she's ever seen have been predicated on the women being weaker than the men -- and them liking it that way.<br />And that's definitely not for her.  What's to do?<br />Keely's betrothed, Prince Sean, looks on from afar, and is impressed.  He likes her spirit and wants her for herself, yet he knows she won't believe him.  Why would she, when she's been told so many inaccurate things about how to behave \\"like a woman,\\" when she's never been any of them (meek, mild, eager to please, inoffensive)?  He pretty much figures, \\"Why would she believe me, anyway?  Even though I do want her as is.\\"  So he devises an ingenious plan . . . . <br />I don't want to give away too much more of the plot than that.  Suffice it to say that Keely is a very engaging character; she's smart, tough, nobody's fool, and extremely impetuous.  She's also gifted, a good warrior, a loyal friend and companion -- and manages to get taken running away from her betrothed, right into the arms of Strahan the Ihlini.<br />One problematic point.  There is an extremely long series of rapes in this book; some younger readers might miss it, but just in case, it'd be better not to have them read it until they're older and can understand.  Itis consistent with how Strahan has been shown in earlier Cheysuli books; the man is evil, and doesn't care who he hurts so long as he does right by his own lights -- which are deeply and horribly skewed due to early influences by his father.<br />I respected Keely all the more after she'd been raped, because she didn't give up.  As she swelled in pregnancy, she refused to give in, despite believing her child would be the worst tainted imaginable (due to her mother's mental illness and Strahan's evilness).  The child dies, thankfully unborn; that spared a whole lot of angst on that side.  <br />However, just because the child ends up dying before birth doesn't mean the moral implications are shirked; Ms. Roberson explores 'em all, with great virtuosity and depth of feeling.  Anyone reading of Keely's plight will share her pain in the horrible circumstances, while sighing in relief after her unborn child (born of the rape) dies unborn, unless they are totally callous and have no heart whatsoever.<br />What Keely fights in the latter half of the book is not only societal strictures against the \\"appropriate\\" roles for women, but also her own beliefs.  She never wanted this to happen, and loses most of her self-esteem, sense of worthiness, and becomes deeply depressed, yet hides her condition from others.  This, too, is very plausible; it's how victims of rape act, especially if they've become pregnant from the act of violence.<br />It's because of Keely's heroism, internal and external, that I'd recommend this book not only to fantasy and romance readers, but to others who need to know there is a way to survive and go on.  Keely managed it; others can too, by reading how she manages to survive.  Even though Keely is a fictional character, she's true to life, moving, honest, and seems more real than many people you might meet on the streets of the world's cities today.<br />Better yet, Keely rebuilds her life, if painfully, and finds not only life again, but love eternal, all without sacrificing one iota of her beliefs.  This is an extremely powerful, uplifting message, one worth sharing with just about everyone you know in my opinion.<br />Highly recommended for anyone over the age of about fourteen or fifteen.  Five stars plus.	2003-06-27
US	32010417	R524NQCIZ1ZUR	043935806X	667539744	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Flawed book 5, but series still good	Revisiting my earlier review, I decided to write a new one for J.K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" which most people would recognize as HP5.<br />HP 5 is more of a coming of age tale than any previous Harry Potter book; if it's taken by itself, it actually makes more sense than if it is taken in the totality of the HP series to date, though, because Harry undergoes a total attitude change here.  He starts to speak in CAPITALS to denote his anger, he yells at his friends, refuses to speak to authority figures, and lets new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge push him around and even abuse him without telling anyone except his friends after they notice something wrong.<br />Harry's anger makes sense, but coming only one month after HP 4 ended, it perhaps doesn't.  I want to know what happened in that month to anger him so much.  Did someone cast a spell on him?  Did Voldemort do something?  What happened in that missing month?<br />And Harry allowing himself to be abused doesn't cut it, either.  He's now 15, and a strong magician.  Why not use his magic on Umbridge?  Why doesn't he try to protect himself?  And later, when Umbridge takes his broomstick and forbids him to play Quidditch forever (something that was not fixed by the end of book 5), why didn't Harry fight her?<br />Also, the fact that Ron and Hermione were made prefects wasn't really used except as something else to torment Harry.  I don't understand that, either.  Plus, as Hermione and Ron were the ones to find out about Umbridge abusing Harry, why didn't they report their suspicions to Dumbledore anyway, as they _are_ supposed to be prefects?<br />And why was Malfoy ever appointed a prefect at all?<br />Those are some of the many minuses.<br />The pluses, however, are that J.K. Rowling tells an engaging, captivating story, and that for whatever reason, during the actual reading itself, the suspension of disbelief works.  IT's afterward, however, when you startto think about various things (such as the magic mirror gift that's never used) that you realize that there were some fairly serious editorial mistakes made here.<br />I'd recommend the Harry Potter series, and I'd even recommend this book, but I wouldn't start here.  Start with book 1.  And take this book as satire more than anything about political institutions; in that way, perhaps, the abuse Harry suffers silently might seem more bearable.<br />I hope all the plot holes will be fixed in the remaining books of this series.	2003-06-27

The plot is as follows: Cimorene the Princess-by-convention (as she wasn't born a Princess, she just works as a Princess) doesn't know where Kazul, her boss (also King of the Dragons) is.  Kazul went on a trip, didn't come home on time, and now Cimorene can't find her.  (The title \\"King\\" in this case is also a misnomer.  A very witty misnomer, but still.)<br />Enter Mendanbar, King of the Enchanted Forest.  He's young, impetuous, ticks off his High Chancellor no end -- and needs a wife.  He goes to Cimorene not for that -- that would be too easy -- but because he, too, wants to find Kazul.<br />As Cimorene and Mendanbar travel, they encounter many interesting people, do quite a few interesting things, and melt several obnoxious wizards.  (The wizards reappear now and again, though, because the melt-job doesn't keep 'em down for too long.)<br />As they slowly grow to like, then love each other, there is much laughter, plenty of mishaps, and a great deal of interesting observations along the way.  And a good time is had by all.<br />I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone above age nine or ten; it's funny, a fast read, and yet the ideas linger in your brain for quite some time.  Cimorene is no pale flower; she's instead an in your face, passionate, modern woman, who makes wisecracks about other Princesses (mostly about their silliness, and about how poorly they've been educated).  And Mendanbar isn't your typical King, either; he's in some senses a callow youth, although he's certainly intelligent enough and a strong magic user.  (Cimorene keeps asking him why his magic is so flashy, which really made me roar.  I kept wanting people to ask that years ago in fantasy novelizations.)<br />So, although this _says_ it's a Young Adult novel, and it indeed can be read and enjoyed by kids, I'd say the adults will probably enjoy it just as much if not more.  I did.<br />Five stars.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-27
US	32010417	RHX2O5W56US9N	0812522257	865620523	A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows (Dominic Flandry)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Dominic Flandry grows up	In \\"A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows,\\" Poul Anderson did the nearly impossible and unthinkable before this book.  He managed to get Dominic Flandry to grow up.<br />Before this book, Flandry, while a brilliant secret agent for the Terran Empire, always was a bit juvenile, and reveled in it.  He figured that if he was going to die soon anyway (as secret agents rarely live long lives), why not make the best of it?  So, he slept with many lissome women, ate lots of good food, and drank lots of great liquor along the way.<br />His other attributes, of loyalty, self-sacrifice, intelligence, a certain type of shifty honesty unusual in a secret agent -- well, they always were underplayed, partly because Flandry was an interstellar James Bond and that might not have been \\"sexy,\\" and partly because Flandry looked at them as bad qualities.<br />Well, no wonder.  The Terran Empire was in decay, and only people like him were holding it together, before the advent of this book.  At the start of this book, Hans Molitor has seized the throne -- with Flandry's blessing, as at least he was a strong military man, and as he was better than any of the other contenders for the throne.  And trouble's brewing all over the Empire . . . .<br />Without the trouble, there's no way Flandry would have been able to go off on his own.  He's now in his 40s, and although he's still an international bon vivant, he's not the same man he used to be.  He's found out he has a son, Dominic Hazeltine, by Persis D'Io (the dancer in \\"Ensign Flandry), and he's starting to perhaps slow down a bit in his travels.<br />But his mind is as keen as ever, so when an exotic, aristocratic slave girl from Dennitza shows up, his interest is piqued.  The more he finds out, the more upset he gets.  Then, he flits off with her, to find out the truth -- which is more shattering than he ever expected.<br />He does run into Aycharaych again, but it's almost more of an afterthought.  Because before this book is done, his life stands in ruin, and about all he has left is his honor, pride, and a job well done -- rather than the life he'd briefly glimpsed in the eyes of Kossara, the Dennitzan slave girl (who never should have been sold for slavery).<br />As he destroys Aycharaych, he realizes that nothing, but nothing, can bring back love -- and wonders what's next for him.  These are astonishingly adult thoughts for Flandry, and extremely moving.<br />This book deserves over five stars because of how moving and heart-wrenching it is for Flandry to go through all this.  I truly believed in his pain, while enjoying his witty repartee with Chives (his Shalmuan body-servant/cook/batman/everything), Kossara, and son Dominic.  Flandry is no intellectual lightweight, and he really does have a heart.  Excellent book; truly one of Anderson's best (and I've read most of his output).<br />Btw, \\"A Stone in Heaven\\" is also another great book about Flandry in his age -- I recommend that one, too, extremely highly.	2003-06-23
US	32010417	R2KBMQ0IBVV780	1878067931	22723993	Exit to Reality	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Excellent dystopic vision	Edith Forbes book &quot;Exit to Reality&quot; is marketed as a &quot;utopian vision,&quot; but it is not.  In actuality, life in the 29th century is a _dystopia_, where every action is highly regulated, and your life path set almost from birth.<br />Lydian, an information analyst, is bored to tears.  Her lover is unexciting; her relationships with co-workers, stale.  Her &quot;Mom&quot; (a machine construct) and &quot;Dad&quot; keep her amused, but no more.  And she wonders what else there is to life than this.<br />As she's cruising the computer bulletin boards one day, she meets an unusual person, Merle.  Merle asks her to meet him in Paris; she barely has enough credits for this, but goes anyway because she's just that bored.  Merle astounds her with his ability to shapeshift, yet no one else seems to notice.<br />As they go to other parts of the world together (he knows how to travel without money), they realize many strange things.  Food doesn't taste quite right.  People act too much the same, considering.  And they definitely *look* too much the same.<br />Simply put: in trying to make things easier, by erasing differences, instead, society made them worse because conformity is now even more rigidly enforced than before.  Finding out that reality is actually on the inside of a computer matrix wasn't as surprising as it may have been before the movie &quot;The Matrix,&quot; but it still wasn't totally expected.<br />Forbes writes well; she's witty and inventive, and her asides about food, tea, and life in general are well worth the price of admission even if the plot hadn't been as good as it was.  In addition, I believed in the romance between the bored Lydian and the uber-shapeshifter Merle; they seemed a good match, as both had wondered for a long time the eternal question, &quot;Is this all there is?  Is there nothing more?&quot; rather than sidestepping it, as most people generally seem to do.<br />This is an excellent book about dystopias and how they never work, and about the continuing and surprising powers of the mind and human achievement.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-23

Not knowing what's happening, she forms an uneasy alliance with a human man -- when she's not totally human, but a mutant with inborn telepathic and telekinetic ability.<br />Thing is, it doesn't stay cliched long, as Sira is a fighter.  She doesn't accept much easily, which is why her growing romance with the man, Jason Morgan, is so troublesome to her.  She wonders if her \\"real\\" self (the one before the memory block) would still like Morgan, and wonders what she was doing before her memory was blocked.<br />Yet she likes Morgan, and soon, it turns to more than like.  Morgan respects her, likes her, finally loves her . . . and they both decide to figure out what happened to her along the way.<br />When she finds a member of her clan, Barac sud Sarc, and demands an explanation, things _really_ start to get interesting.<br />The pacing is medium at best, but the medium-to-slow pace is an advantage, here.  It's a character study, laid against an alien backdrop, with more than a bit of romance to leaven the mix.<br />Still probably Czerneda's best overall novel to date.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-23

It's too long, overburdened with description, and I don't believe the romance between hardened scientist Gail Smith and much younger Aaron Pardell.<br />I did like most of Ms. Czerneda's minor characters, and enjoyed her perspective of what life on an actual space station might be like. But compared to \\"A Thousand Words for Stranger\\" or \\"Beholder's Eye,\\" this book is extremely disappointing.<br />It seems to go on too long; I'm not sure why this is.  Some of the description is absolutely essential, and I buy into that.  And I like the two main characters separately; I just don't believe in their romance.<br />Maybe I'm a romantic at heart, and that's the main reason I'm downgrading this book.  But in her other novels, the romances make sense and are believable; here, it doesn't make sense on Gail's side (although I can see why Aaron would like her, as she accepts him for who he is), and that's why the romance wasn't believable to me.<br />Another person may find it differently than I did.<br />In addition, as I said before in re-reviewing these novels, Ms. Czerneda is one of my favorite writers.  I hold her to a higher standard.  And that's the main reason this book gets 2 1/2 stars (not two -- I gave it that before because I didn't know you could give fractions in a review) . . . it has some very strong pluses as well as the minuses.<br />But the writing is good, mind, and the premise makes sense (with the exception of that romance).  I'd just rather people started with \\"A Thousand Words for Stranger\\" or \\"Beholder's Eye,\\" which are much better and involving novels, than this; \\"In the Company of Others\\" just isn't as interesting to me as the other works, which is why I give it two and a half stars...	2003-06-23

His Emperor, unbeknownst to him at the time, was dead; his sons were incompetent.  His love was dead; his son was dead; he didn't believe in his job any longer, and he'd taken out his biggest adversary.<br />So, what was left?  This book shows the answer: plenty.<br />The younger son of Hans Molitor now holds the throne in his incompetent grasp, and worse, does not like Flandry.  So, although Flandry is now a Vice-Admiral and commands much respect, he isn't thrown too many assignments.  OTOH, he is able to make his own schedule, so when Miriam Abrams, daughter of mentor Max Abrams (his superior in &quot;Ensign Flandry&quot;), manages to get to him to point out a major problem on Ramnau, he leaves.<br />Once again, he finds intrigue and lots of it, problems, and pain.  But unlike &quot;A Knight of Ghost and Shadows,&quot; Flandry this time finds more while he's solving the mystery.  He and Abrams reach an understanding, and more or less pair off by the end of the book.  He also helps solve her problem, take out a would-be Emperor candidate, and rehabilitate his image with Emperor Gerhardt (the younger son of Hans Molitor) in the process, so it's definitely not a wasted trip.<br />Along the way, we see an older, almost used-up Chives, still serving Flandry as best he can . . . it's heartbreaking, really, although also encouraging.  And Flandry's still hanging in there, despite the loss of his love, his son, and most of his reason for living fifteen-plus years before, which is also a very good thing.<br />Btw, I was really astonished to find out this book is out of print, when &quot;A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows&quot; is not.  Let's hope someone pays Anderson's widow for the rights to this excellent book, so people unfamiliar with Anderson will be able to read it for themselves.<br />Five stars plus, and highly recommended.	2003-06-23

It does not live up to the promise of the first two books in the series, \\"Beholder's Eye\\" and \\"Changing Visions,\\" and it brought back someone I was hoping was safely dead from the first book -- Skalet.<br />Skalet is not a likable person by any means.  She does lots of things for the wrong reasons, and never did understand Esen.  To have _her_ be the last surviving member of the original six (aside from Esen) made me feel cheated.  And I really didn't like her being in this book.<br />Since she's such an integral part of the book, that might explain why I mostly didn't like it.  The ending is rather hopeful, I guess, but it was a trial and a struggle to get there.  And, frankly, I put the book down for a good week and a half before I went back to it, and had no trouble finishing the thing, with no need to re-read anything for greater clarity.<br />Note that my husband has a dissenting view; his point is that, as an author, if you can delineate your world so well that it sticks in the reader's brain, especially if you don't like one of the characters, you're doing your job.  :)<br />At any rate, because I dislike Skalet so very much, and because I don't like how she interacts with Esen (she pushes her around, as older siblings often do), I had a very hard time getting through this novel.<br />I still like Esen and Paul, and their relationship; I liked most of the other people in this book, even the flawed Kearn who's _still_ trying to rehabilitate himself.  But as I did not like Skalet, it made it harder to buy into the premise of this book.<br />As for how to rate the whole series, I'd give the series four stars.  It's a good series, and other folks might not hate Skalet as much as I do. ;-)  And I really like the premise (it's extremely original and well done), and hope that Ms. Czerneda will write more books in this universe (hopefully without Skalet, or with a reformed Skalet that isn't as repulsive).<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-06-23
US	32010417	RU7THUG6TML94	0886778182	622962887	Beholder's Eye (Web Shifters)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Excellent start to new series	\\"Beholder's Eye\\" is one fantastic novel.<br />Esen is an alien shapeshifter with a twist; her race shares memories quite literally, by eating of themselves. It's rather disgusting to contemplate, but that's what they do -- and they're used to it.<br />Thing is, Esen wasn't expected.  The rest of her race happened by fission; she happened through sexual experimentation with a different race, which might be why she's different than the others.  Although all are female, she's younger, more nervous, more innocent, and much more childlike overall.<br />During her first \\"assignment\\" elsewhere to pick up new information for her people (all six of them), Esen finds a human man in trouble.  She liberates him, and gets him away; this causes immediate problems for him, but also opens up a world of possibilities.<br />While they're getting to know each other in a sort of father-daughter way (she's much too young for him), a big, bad version of something similar to her own race happens by.  They're doing bad things, for bad reasons; her own people aren't pleased.<br />The rest of the novel basically shows what Esen and Paul try to do to keep the situation from escalating any further, while continuing to deepen their relationship.<br />Very strong start to a new series.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-23
US	32010417	RCZ68PYO5OTTG	0886779049	321390679	Changing Vision (Web Shifters)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Pretty good follow up to "Beholder's Eye"	\\"Changing Visions\\" is a better than average novel, full of lots of derring-do, action, and suspense.  It has some great characters in Esen the shapeshifter and Paul the human, and their interaction is interesting and well done.<br />So, why does it mostly leave me cold, when I otherwise like Ms. Czerneda's writing?  I'm not sure.  I really like Paul and Esen -- their development here makes sense, is well thought out, and it's an enjoyable relationship all the way around.  And I felt sorry for Largas, Kearn, and most of the other characters that Paul and Esen are unfortunately forced to outfox during this book.<br />Still, this book is not as strong as the first (granted, the first was exceptional). It's a good novel, but it's not up to the standard of \\"Beholder's Eye\\" or \\"A Thousand Words for Stranger.\\"  I'm not sure what's up with that; it seems that Ms. Czerneda gets a really good concept, writes a book about it, then writes a few sequels because the concept isn't exhausted.  Nothing wrong with that, but the quality dips consistently in follow-up books -- and especially here moreso than in the Trade Pact universe setup.<br />Of course, when your first book is one of my top twenty all time books, it's pretty hard to live up to that standard, too. ;-)  Revisiting this review, I realized something; I hold Ms. Czerneda, along with a few other favorite writers like eluki bes shahar (also known as Rosemary Edghill), Mercedes Lackey, Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, and Lois McMaster Bujold, to a higher standard than others.<br />With some other writer, I might give this a higher rating; my original rating was three stars (wanting to give it three and a half, but not knowing that I could say so here).  For another writer writing the very same book, I'd probably give it four or four and a half, which is why the newly adjusted rating.<br />Esen is extremely interesting, and I like to see her interact with others.  She's written well; she's an innocent child _and_ a Stranger ina Strange Land, all in one.  And I like Paul, who's interesting, flawed, and an overall meaty character.<br />But there's just something about this book that nags at me, that says it should have been better than it is.  Probably the fact that the first was so outstanding; no matter how well written this book is, and it is very well done, it can't compare with the originality of the first because that's where I met the vast majority of these characters.<br />But that's not Ms. Czerneda's fault; she wrote an interesting world and wanted to play some more.  This is a good book, and as such, I've adjusted the rating accordingly, to a four star effort.<br />Barb Caffrey<br />Oh, and yes, I'd definitely recommend this series to anyone.  It's very well done.  (Even though I hate Skalet, mind you.)	2003-06-23

Barac, who's been an important minor character in the first two books (&quot;A Thousand Words for Stranger,&quot; &quot;Ties of Power&quot;), really comes into his own, here.<br />And it's because of the fact that he finds love, then is able to act on that love (when he'd believed he was incapable of finding anyone) that makes this book so good.  His anguish at finding love, to believing he wouldn't be able to convert (due to the additional psionic complications of being a member of the Clan, and his beloved also being the same), to finding out that yes, indeed, he'd finally found his beloved and *was* going to be able to live the rest of his life with her, was well worth every bit of what I paid for this novel.<br />The rest?  Well, the Morgans spend too much time apart, here.  Considering Sira has the ability to teleport practically anywhere, Ms. Czerneda had to put her basically into a coma, locked inside her head -- that made sense.  But making the Drapsk do it, and then not really explaining why they did it except with the sort of Gallic shrug (as in, &quot;Who knows why they did it?  They're aliens!&quot;) didn't really cut it with me.<br />I really liked Huido, though, and his colorful asides in the Interludes also helped liven up the book.  Still, as I said, if this were a stand alone novel, I'd have given it a lesser rating.  And because it _is_ a series novel, I'd definitely not even try to have someone start here; read the previous two books in the series, or you'll be hopelessly lost.	2003-06-23

I also liked the very antagonistic attitude Sira had toward most of the other Clan members -- especially her father.<br />I don't think this book is quite up to the standard of her first book, though.  It's longer, which is OK, I guess, and adds in lots of interesting things (the Drapsk, her cousin Barac's problems finding a woman get more airplay, her female cousin what's her name's relationship problems), but it doesn't focus as well as &quot;A Thousand Words for Stranger,&quot; either.<br />Still, it's a very good book, and it was an interesting read.  I'd recommend it to others, but only if they read it in sequence.  Otherwise, this book would not make much sense.	2003-06-23
US	32010417	R24SAJ37CORKGA	1587151154	413668465	Vengeance of Masks	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Very surprising book that deserves to sell lots of copies	\\"Vengeance of Masks\\" once again proves that Rosemary Edghill can write anything, and do it with flair.<br />The story is written in two different styles, which befits the two almost diametrically opposed characters.  The first is written in an epic, almost melodramatic style.  This is befitting, as the first character, Childeric, has an almost luckless existence.  He's God-emperor of the Eidolon Empire, but realizes he has no real power at the ripe old age of eight.  His uncle, Prince-Regent Dabaoth, wants to kill him, but can't due to politics and the unusual power the Emperor holds.<br />Simply put, the Emperor holds a demon enchained; to be Emperor, you must surrender your will to a mask, which is supposed to give you control over the demon -- and thus, everyone else as well.<br />However, this isn't quite true.  If you use the mask too soon, the demon can bind you -- and that's what happens to the luckless Childeric.<br />As his horrific story unfolds, we meet our second character, Arcadia.  She's a writer, producer, and film maker from our world, but isn't famous and perhaps doesn't even want to be.  Yet, as we meet her, fleeing from a party where her would-be boyfriend basically hit her up for a \\"if you give me what I want (entry into film school), I'll give you what you want (sex)\\" deal, she's very upset, nervous, strung out, and half-drunk.  Her car goes off the road . . . problem is, she wakes up in the Eidolon Empire.<br />Yet, it might not be, because she's stuck where she is.  She can't really go anywhere.  Then, she meets Childeric, and realizes he's the character she wrote about years ago . . . someone who's had too much doom follow him, and now believes in almost nothing, yet is more noble than not despite doing unspeakable, savage things in the name of survival.<br />The ending is a major cliffhanger; I'm not even going to try and get into that.  Suffice it to say that I read this book in one sitting, and can barely wait to find out the ending (revealed, I hope, in book two).<br />Ms. Edghill outdid herself with the characterization of Childeric.  He's noble, caustic, self-absorbed, abusive, and lovable despite himself by turns -- a do-gooder fully aware his deeds might not amount to much, yet compelled to do it anyway.  Oh, and every so often, Childeric does something totally shocking and seemingly out of character, almost as if he's saying to the reader, \\"I don't want to be lovable.  Leave me alone.\\"<br />Sorry, doesn't work that way. :)<br />Arcadia is closer to most of Ms. Edghill's heroines.  She's smart, tough, can take care of herself, very witty, and more than a little shell-shocked about the situation in which she finds herself.  And Arcadia, whenever she shows up, is written in a very straightforward prose style (similar to most of Ms. Edghill's other s/f and fantasy writing); Childeric, while he's onstage, talks in near-Shakespearean overtones and cadences, as if he's a character in an epic melodrama (which, indeed, he is).<br />This is a terrific, multi-layered book, with lots of surprises, suspense, and mystery.  Also an intriguing hint of romance (which isn't quite as expected, either, by the heroine).<br />If I could give this book over five stars, I would.  Definitely the best book of the year so far, hands down.  Buy this book!	2003-06-22
US	32010417	R1XKDVTDDJKQ4F	0446601071	903244909	Seasons	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good story about abuse and healing	\\"Seasons\\" is a rarity from Constance O'Day-Flannery, as it's a straightforward romance (rather than a time-travel book) starring three sisters.  Allie is the oldest; she's tough and strong, but tired of the pretense of her life.  Although she looks like she has it all (money, good looks, good clothes, respect), it's all an act.  Her husband abused her, and treated her horribly, while he lived.  Now that he's dead, how does she learn to trust herself again?<br />Nancy is the youngest; Allie's husband blackmailed her into having sex with him.  And, she has drug problems, and is undergoing rehab for cocaine addiction at the start of this book.<br />The middle sister's name I can't remember; she has a solid, but unspectacular marriage.  Her husband is a nice guy, but isn't paying attention to her.  And her kids get on her nerves.<br />Basically, I bought into this book mainly because of how well Ms. O'Day-Flannery wrote Allie and Nancy.  Allie's portrait of a woman trying to re-learn how to live after her bad husband dies is spot-on.  She eventually finds a lover, a very good man who treats her well, and starts to enjoy life again.<br />Nancy's portrait, too, is right on the money, as she's tired, weakened, and ill -- just as any drug addict in rehab would be.  As she comes to terms with all she did wrong (her family at the start is alienated, but toward the end has reconciled with her), she learns how to reconnect with herself.<br />The main weakness was the middle sister's romance.  Although I agree that writing about solid marriages isn't considered \\"sexy\\" or \\"in,\\" as it's hard to dredge up conflict between long-term lovers, the things that drove the middle sister away seemed to me to be forced.  I couldn't really buy into that; the middle sister's husband has to know his wife better than this, so that all seemed to be horribly contrived (even for the genre).<br />(I hope I got the names of the sisters right, btw.  I remember Nancy very well. Hot-shot corporate lawyer with a major drug problem.  The other sisters' names aren't as clear, after all this time.  It's been over three years since I read this book.)<br />This is a memorable story about people who make bad decisions (marrying the wrong man, getting into drugs) and who are abused (the oldest sister's story) going on with their life and finding meaning.  I remember most of it very, very well after three years of not reading it; I take this as a good sign.<br />If you can find this book, you'll almost certainly enjoy it, as it has touches of humor throughout, and very realistic characterizations of the oldest and youngest sisters.  Probably Ms. O'Day-Flannery's best book to date.	2003-06-20

She's the King's sister, but Theron (the King) doesn't want anything to do with her.  He's still angry about her refusing a betrothal from years back, and can't forgive and forget.<br />Instead of going to live in Cemandia with whoever it was the King had wanted her to marry, Annice became a Bard.  And she's a most powerful Bard indeed; she sings all four Quarters of the magic system (Earth, Air, Water and Fire) equally.  Not many can do that.<br />And in this world/universe, Bards are powerful.  They save kids by using the power of the Earth, Air, etc., they hear news quickly due to Air Elementals bringing it to them (if they have the gift to \\"sing\\" Air), they create music and put the power of their magic behind it.<br />What Theron doesn't know is this.  If Annice had gone to Cemandia, she'd have been stoned to death or driven out of the country.  Cemandians do not believe in Bards; they do not like them.  It disagrees with how they view the Universe or something, and they really can't stand it.<br />So, Annice, in her insistence to be trained, did the right thing.<br />However, there's a new problem.  The man she's picked to become the father of her child (her life-mate is a woman, so she needed to find a man, as this world/universe does not have sperm donating technology) lives on the Cemandian border.  As she swells in pregnancy, she has to protect him from being put to death by Theron (who doesn't know all the facts) and his own people (who are being actively misled).<br />What will happen?  Some of what you expect -- and some of what you wouldn't. :)<br />There's lots of humor in this book, and I liked Annice very much.  Only reason I can't really give this book five stars is that Annice seems much too old and wise for someone in her early 20s.  She just shouldn't be as old and mature as she has been drawn.  I'd have bought into it easier if Annice had been in her early 30s. Also, some of the threat is because Annice has dared to have a child out of wedlock (like I said, she didn't have much choice, because of her life-partner being female), and because Annice is still of royal blood.<br />Simply put, I just don't buy that Theron ever would have put her to death because she wanted to have a child.  I just don't buy it, not once.<br />Oh, one of the bright spots of the book is Jazep, the Bard who sings only Earth.  (He's the most powerful singer of Earth they've ever known, though.  Don't feel too sorry for him.)  He's very strong and committed, but has a very good sense of humor -- the implicit understanding, at least for me, was that if Annice had been interested in taking a male lover, Jazep would have been it.  Making it all the more puzzling why she'd go and find someone else to father her child . . . (of course, she knew she wouldn't stay with Jazep, either.  That was probably it.  She had her own wife to deal with.)<br />Very strong novel from Ms. Huff.  Very enjoyable.	2003-06-20
US	32010417	RZEUTTE3TF1B6	0886775639	244178142	Winds of Change (The Mage Winds, Book 2)	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Three and a half star fantasy	&quot;Winds of Change&quot; was much better than &quot;Winds of Fate,&quot; and I wish the former, rather than the latter, had been the start of the &quot;Mage Winds&quot; trilogy.<br />I know this flies in the face of just about every other reviewer here.  Bear with me, please.<br />In the first book, &quot;Winds of Fate,&quot; Elspeth, heir to the throne of Valdemar, had gone off to find some mages, because Valdemar was in grave danger, and it had none.  Along the way, she found out that *she* was a mage, and prospectively very, very powerful; she also regressed quite a bit from how she'd been previously drawn in &quot;By the Sword&quot; and the &quot;Arrows&quot; trilogy.<br />Darkwind, in the first book, started off as an ex-mage and had to take up the mantle of magecraft again, because his clan, K'Sheyna, was in grave danger, and most of the mages were tapped out.<br />The thing is, if I'd read this book alone, I'd have liked it better.  Darkwind and Elspeth are drawn to be much more sympathetic characters in this book.  They have interests outside magecraft, and we see a bit of that.  We also see Gwena finally getting her comeuppance (in the first book, Gwena, Elspeth's Companion, really raised Hell because she tried to coerce Elspeth into doing things, rather than asking or explaining anything).  And we see more about Treyvan and Hydona, as well as more from Nyara and Skif.<br />Nyara really starts to come into her own, here.  Without her efforts, Mornelithe Falconsbane (the big bad guy) would not be put down at the end of this book.  And, without Treyvan and Hydona, the book would lose quite a bit of light, laughter, and love, as their successful romance foreshadows both Darkwind and Elspeth's eventual pairing-off and Skif and Nyara's as well.<br />The thing is, like I said before, it's *not* the first book in a trilogy.  It's the second.  And, as such, I have to go off the first book, or this book would make no sense whatsoever.<br />So, much as I like thisbook, and would like to give it a higher rating, I feel in good conscience I can't.  So, I'm giving it three and a half stars, and would definitely recommend it -- with the extremely grudging addition that, without &quot;Winds of Fate,&quot; this book will make little to no sense.	2003-06-19
US	32010417	RO339BR2KTCUT	0765343649	277915668	Archform: Beauty	Books	5	3	3	N	N	One of Modesitt's best	&quot;Archform: Beauty&quot; is a masterpiece.<br />In &quot;Archform: Beauty,&quot; L.E. Modesitt, Jr., manages to do something very, very few other writers have done well.  That's to juggle five multiple points of view, and have them interrelate, while solving a mystery at the same time.<br />In the near future, music has been taken over by &quot;resonance&quot; music, artificial overlays intended to evoke emotion by intent, rather than by the beauty of the design.  To make matters worse, in this world, only the middle class on up can afford the health treatment needed to stay alive, as there are now so many genetically engineered virii out there that no doctor or Center for Disease Control can keep up.<br />So, nanotechnology has taken the place of that, and if you have the money, you can get the treatment.  Otherwise, you get the shaft.<br />So, the music teacher (one of the five viewpoint characters) laments the loss of one of her students, because her student didn't have the money to get treatment for the latest killer disease.  (Students, as you may know, are almost always broke by definition.)  The ruthless businessman, another character, says things like this are good for business (or at least implies it), and shrugs it off.  The newspaper man (another character) says it's horrible and runs statistics.  The policeman tries to correlate the stats he has on the illness and on other things, and tries to project crime waves (another nice near-future touch, something similar to the movie &quot;Minority Report&quot;) and stop them (or at least mitigate them) before they happen.  And the congressmen tries to balance everything, the needs of the many against the needs of the few -- and sees that music *is* necessary to the future after all, not just this new &quot;rez&quot; stuff.<br />I believe this book is one of Modesitt's best; it's more subtle than the Ecolitan saga, it's more complex than the Soprano Sorceress stuff, and it's a lot more developed than his Recluce series.  (All of those are very good seria, btw.  Just not as good as this stand alone book in my opinion.)<br />This book is a very enjoyable read; highly recommended.	2003-06-19
US	32010417	R3F20MHDVHWUE8	0425184978	107328132	Words of the Witches	Books	4	14	15	N	N	One great story, two good, several blah	\\"Words of the Witches\\" is highly uneven, but when it's good, it's very, very good.<br />I bought this book primarily because of Rosemary Edghill's contribution.  I really like her Bast character, and her story \\"The Iron Bride,\\" which is a short Bast mystery, was included here.  This is by far the best story in the collection, showing wicked humor, vivid characterizations, and a very complex problem.<br />The problem is this (and it's how this book relates, btw, to the rest of the collection): Bast is a third-level initiate.  She really needs to start her own coven, but does not want to do so.  The mystery she solves basically tells her in not so many words that it's time to do so, whether she wants to or not.<br />Bast's problem is a realistic one, and it's presented with both accuracy and humor.  In addition, the fact that Bast is extremely smart and hasn't really found a man up to her intellectual weight is one of the biggest points in Bast's favor.  That, too, is very realistic, as Wiccans and NeoPagans of all stripes tend to be smarter than average, but there _is_ still a range.<br />Basically, the rest of the collection shows Pagans in favorable lights.  Only one or two men have strong parts to play; one is a divorced father, the other is a dying soon-to-be father.  The reviewer who pointed out the absence of males in this book makes a very, very good point.<br />The three best stories are Ms. Edghill's, where the men aren't as important as Bast (and rightfully so!  She's the point of view character, and once again makes a big point out of not finding anyone for her yet), Ms. Vaughn's \\"A Solitary Path,\\" where the heroine, Tobi, basically makes a sort of soul connection with a dream creation that may or may not be real, and would rather wait for someone that does at least that much for her, and the romance \\"The Spelling Error\\" by Jen Sokolowski (that's the one featuring the divorced father).<br />There are several other good stories here, but they vary a lot, and aren't evenly paced.  \\"Psyche's Tears\\" was pretty good, but I didn't totally buy the transformation from the vivid Desdemona to the rather pallid denise, and I really didn't buy the POV character's all of a sudden acceptance of Denise, either.  The Gypsy story, \\"Tamborine Moon,\\" was also good, but had a few problems. The biggest is the last line; it makes no sense, and should have either been struck in editing, or modified somehow to make it fit with the rest of the story.  Also, I had a problem with the premise.  After the whole story makes a point about how alienated the Gypsy mother is from her two grown daughters, all of a sudden _one_ of them is going to take to her Craft?  Not likely!<br />Then, the biggest problematic story in the collection came from the heaviest hitter (sales wise; trust me, the heaviest hitter author wise was Ms. Edghill), Maggie Shayne.  Her story, \\"Anytown U.S.A.,\\" did have some things to recommend it.  It flowed well and easily.  I liked the teenage girl witches.  I liked the older woman witch.<br />But as another reviewer said, the minister's wife, who also happened to be a witch in the \\"broom closet,\\" didn't come off.  Her husband was way too stereotypical, and very, very nasty.  Also, if he _was_ so abusive, why in the world would the woman want to do something like she does (basically stops an assembly from rioting, and admits she's a witch, which stuns them all)?  Even if she never goes home again, he could go and find her and kill her.<br />That's the problem with making the husband an abuser.  You get it all; the abusive mindset on his part, and the cowed, abjective one on hers.  Trust me; the minister's wife would _not_ act like this in real life.  At best, she'd stand with someone else after _they_ admitted they were a witch, like when the Principal comes up to show solidarity.  (If Shayne had shown the Principal as a witch in hiding, and then the minister's wife came out of hiding after a policeman also came out of the \\"broom closet,\\" then maybe I'd understand the presmise.)<br />And her husband would not leave her alone; he's an abuser, and he's not tired of her yet.  So, her shaking her head \\"no\\" on the stage to him would do nothing more than enrage him.<br />So, despite it being a well-written story, that huge, huge plot hole ruined it for me.<br />At any rate, Ms. Edghill's story is 5 stars plus; Ms. Vaughn's is just under 5 stars; Ms. Sokolowski's is 4.5 stars.  Ms. Shayne's would be 2 stars, at best.  The rest were in the middle.<br />Because the three stories I mentioned first are so very, very good, I'd rather rate this anthology on the high end, which is why I gave it four stars in the first place.<br />Btw, some reviewers have pointed out this book shows a whole lot of basics for novice witches.  That's almost certainly true.  Still, think about all the people that might read this book, from the fans of Ms. Edghill to the fans of Maggie Shayne.  Not all of them have any idea what NeoPagans or Wiccans are about.  Some of that needed to be in here.  Maybe not as much from each author (I was very glad that two of the three stories I mentioned as my favorites didn't have those components), but it did need to be in the collection.<br />Some of the folks that read this book are certainly in the \\"broom closet,\\" or at least want to understand friends of theirs (or family members) that are NeoPagans and/or Wiccans.  This book should definitely help in that regard, as it shows that Wiccans are the same in most regards as anyone else.<br />As I've said elsewhere recently, I don't really understand why so many people get hyped on what \\"flavor\\" your religion is.  So long as you have a pure heart, and care about others, and follow either \\"Love One Another\\" or \\"Do as Ye Will, An Ye Harm None,\\" I can't see that the Deity above us all will care whatsoever.<br />Books like this are important, because hopefully it'll change some ignorant people's perceptions.  And most of the stories are good;a few are exceptional.<br />I'd definitely recommend this book.	2003-06-17

First, it's a very good story about a mother and daughter bonding after ten years of broken communication. I bought into that part.<br />But it's the externals that were a problem for me.  Nora Bridge is a radio talk show host, something like Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and talks a lot about family values.  Her radio listeners know she's divorced, and has two grown daughters.<br />Thing is, they're about to find out that, when she was younger (and still married), she had some semi-nude photos taken of her.  This act of rebellion shows up to bite her years later, and she flees from reporters trying to make their names on the scandal.<br />Ruby Bridge is a disillusioned, highly immature woman of 27.  She's been most recently a waitress, but thinks of herself as an out of work comedienne.  She's a good writer, but not so good at delivering the goods as a comic.  But then, she gets two big breaks; a shot on TV (a show like \\"Politically Incorrect\\") as a comic and sitting on a panel, then gets a chance to write a tell-all about her mother from a major magazine (something like \\"The New Yorker\\").  She takes it, as she just lost her job at the restaurant, and really, she hates her mother anyway.<br />Thing is, she goes to take care of her mother after her mother has a car accident (drinking and driving, no less), and breaks her leg.  They go back to the ancestral home (not sure why they still have it; Ms. Hannah did account for it in her book, but I can't remember why just now) on one of the islands off the coast of Washington state; this is designed to keep Nora out of the public eye while she starts to heal.<br />Thing is, Ruby's exposé must be delivered soon, and yet she finds out more and more about her mother.  Things she had never expected.  Things she really should have known, but thrust away (her father was an alcoholic, and cheated on her mother).<br />Really, it's the more \\"minor\\" characters that carried this book in my opinion.  First, the dying Eric was a great character; he knew what life was like, had lived it to the fullest, and wasn't afraid of dying (despite the fact that he was under 30).  This was realistic; I've been around people with a terminal disease before, and it doesn't matter how old they are chronologically.  All of them want to be released from their body, because it hurts.<br />Second, the other sister, Caroline, is a much better person than Ruby.  She, too, has a deeply troubled life; her husband cheats on her, and she's extremely unhappy.  She tries to hold it together by being overly obsessive about her appearance and how she raises her kids, but it's obvious from the first time she shows up in the novel that she's very, very hurt.<br />Ruby's romance with Eric's brother Dean is forgettable; a few decent sex scenes, then they decide to marry.  Why?  Because Ms. Hannah needed some romance, I guess; wish she would have found someone to throw at Nora Bridge, who deserved it far more than Ruby.<br />And Caroline's life stinks, too.  Nora tells Caroline to go back to her husband in not so many words, despite him being a womanizer and a liar.  This makes no sense; telling her to try to work it out _while separated_ would have made more sense, as Caroline's husband needed a whole lot of counseling and consciousness raising before he'd change.  This part took half a star away from the rating, because it was not realistic at all in my opinion.<br />The second thing that took a star away was this.  Look, I'm a writer; I know how long it takes to write opinions, current events articles, and longer factual pieces, as well as novels.<br />To be blunt, Ms. Hannah's characterization of getting a magazine piece, writing it _while researching is in process_, and delivering it in only ten days, was completely unbelievable.  It does not fly; there is no way it could be done.<br />No way in the world.<br />Also, I have a hard time buying the fact that Ruby would get big bucks to do the exposé in the first place.  I can believe _little_ bucks, but big bucks?  From a first-time author?  From someone who's known to hate her mother?  Not particularly believable, in my opinion.<br />Finally, the last thing that took a star away was this.  There was a very strange and offputting flash-forward section towards the end of the book.  In this flash-forward, Ruby talks about \\"ten years of affluence\\" (when she's always been broke -- one reason she took the money for the tell-all exposé is because of the amount of problems she'd had paying her bills), and her dying friend Eric is _still living_, ten years down the road.  However, without further ado, after about a page and a half of this confusing nonsense, we're back to present day, where Eric is still dying of end-stage cancer (and he _does_ die, even further confusing the issue), Ruby's still broke, and she's wondering if she'll ever marry Dean after all.<br />This made absolutely no sense, and although it may not be Ms. Hannah's fault (the editors or typesetters could have screwed this up somehow), it was something that totally distracted me from an otherwise engaging read.  Plus, it got my hopes up that Eric, who I liked more than any other character in the book, was going to live after all through a miracle.  Instead, he dies, and Ruby marries Dean -- something that is a total anticlimax from my standpoint, as Ruby and Dean aren't anywhere near as good of people as Eric was.<br />Because of these flaws, although I agree with the Amazon main review that says \\"Summer Island\\" is a great read for mothers and daughters, I believe it is too problematical to recommend.<br />If you want to read Ms. Hannah's work, go read \\"When Lightning Strikes,\\" which is much better than this.  I feel this is a worthy, but extremely flawed, book.  Therefore, I'm giving it 2.5 stars on the head -- and I'll let you make up your own mind.	2003-06-17
US	32010417	RVX6M3CRAJN00	0449149080	771601574	When Lightning Strikes	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Lightning Strikes a chord . . .	\\"When Lightning Strikes\\" definitely struck a chord with me.<br />The basic plot of the book is as follows.  Alaina (Lainie) Costanza is a romance writer, but she's no wimpy, frou-frou darling.  Nope, she chain-smokes, drinks on occasion, wears tacky outfits, and is generally a hell-raiser.  There are reasons for her behavior I'll get to in a moment; suffice it to say that only two things are keeping her together at this point: her writing talent, and her teenage daughter, Kelly.<br />John Killian is an outlaw, a former Texas Ranger who feels like he's lost everything.  His wife died years ago and he couldn't save her; once that happened, he felt his soul rip apart, and decided to live down to his reputation.  Now he's the leader of a notorious bunch of outlaws.<br />How do these two relate?  It's not as simple as it appears at first.  At first, Lainie gets thrown back from her time (early 1990s) to Killian's time (late 1800s); Killian isn't exactly overjoyed to see her.  Lainie is in a state of shock at first, thinking it's all a dream.<br />But it's not.<br />Instead, Lainie finds out slowly that Killian is her soulmate.  And that she, in an earlier life, was the wife that left him alone.  And as she and Killian learn to trust each other again, they overcome nearly insurmountable problems.<br />Item 1: Lainie was gangraped at least once.  Used to do drugs.  Her parents abandoned her, and the foster system didn't work.  Her daughter is the result of the rape; she kept her daughter and loves her, which shows enormous strength of character.  (As if being creative and reaching for her dreams wasn't enough strength for anyone; well, this is a romance, and I suppose this is a bigger \\"hook\\" to grab the reader.)<br />Item 2: Killian was a Texas Ranger, as I said before, and was a very good law enforcement officer.  He was married to Emily (Lainie's previous incarnation), and was sent off on a mission to Mexico.  While there, he got thrown in jail; she waited for a long time, then, (perhaps after being raped and abused herself because her husband was gone -- she lived on the Texas frontier alone), ended up killing herself.  That's how John became a villain; he felt like he must be one, because his beloved wife had left him like that.  And he blamed himself for being thrown in jail, and couldn't forgive himself.<br />Both characters are looking for salvation, and in this book, they find it.  In each other, granted, but that's what they needed.  Both needed a second chance with the other, to be able to love and be loved in return.  They get that chance through an unusual twist; they don't want to give it up, yet if Lainie doesn't return to the 20th century, Kelly will be put in foster care -- and Lainie knows all about _that_.<br />So, she and Killian believe it's a choice between love of parent for child and love for each other, and both make love to each other with a sadness that is palpable.  Instead of being joyous, they are miserable; they know this is all they are ever likely to have.  Yet, how could they pass it up?<br />How Ms. Hannah brought off the obligatory happy ending is up to you to find out; I will say that I enjoyed it and found it reasonably realistic.  (I still wonder, though, how Killian found the 20th century, what he found to do, how Lainie was able to get him the ID she'd so blithely talked about, and what Kelly thought of him.  This book demands a sequel.)<br />So, even though some of the historical details one of the editorial reviews talked about were missing (Lainie doesn't spend much time on detail; she does talk about what the men wear and a lot about the scenery), this book deserves five stars.  For more than one reason; it's not every book that shows that love, even a love like this, can be funny, sexy, sweet, poignant, and sad, all by turns.<br />Yet love, in real life, _is_ like this.  And that is why I'd give \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" five stars.<br />Two more things.  The character of Viloula is wonderful; check her out.  She might live in the late 1800s, but she's a modern woman indeed, and I believed fully in her characterization.  Also, Ms. Hannah is to be commended for how she writes her love scenes; the dialogue and description crackles with life, and it shows exactly how Lainie loses what barriers she has left and surrenders to love.  And to herself.<br />Highly recommended.  And by far the best book Ms. Hannah has ever written.	2003-06-17
US	32010417	RJZ1SWK2J9QHW	0886773520	42355391	Magic's Pawn (The Last Herald-Mage Series, Book 1)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Emotionally honest fantasy	\\"Magic's Pawn\\" is an emotionally honest fantasy.<br />Many previous reviewers have missed the point; a few seemed to get it.  Here goes: in life, people take chances.  They grow.  They change.  Sometimes, people you love make mistakes, and bad ones at that, for the best of reasons.<br />And sometimes, worst of all, those people die, seemingly meaninglessly, randomly, and heartbreakingly.<br />That's a fact.  And although it's not commonly seen in fantasy, maybe it should be seen more often; if it were, maybe then, more people would understand the point(s) of this book.<br />I think Ms. Lackey did two very strong things in \\"Magic's Pawn.\\"  First, she fleshed out the backstory of the Valdemar world and series quite nicely.  (Vanyel appeared in the beginning of \\"Arrow's of the Queen,\\" in the tale Talia was reading as she spun the wool.)  Second, she showed a troubled young man go through some realistic changes (considering), and based her fantasy on honest emotions and how people relate.<br />Those looking for monumental epics need to look elsewhere; that's not Ms. Lackey's style anyway.  Although she could probably write it, and do a fair hand at it, she's much more suited to emotionally strong characters with real problems.  That's why this trilogy, the \\"Arrows\\" trilogy, \\"Oathbreakers,\\" and \\"By the Sword\\" remain my favorites of her books (I'd also put \\"Exile's Honor\\" in this category); those books focus on characters who are realistic, who do things that are commonsensical (even if sometimes wrong), deal with real issues, and the fantasy plot overlay goes along with it and makes sense, too.<br />It's not an extremely conflict laden book -- let me rephrase.  It's not an _externally_ conflict laden book -- the internal conflicts are heartwrenching and totally believable.  And really, I don't see why there needs to be lots and lots of people dying for people to see the point!<br />Don't get me wrong.  I like twists and turns in my plots just fine.  Sometimes, as in \\"Oathbreakers\\" and \\"By the Sword,\\" Lackey does put a fair amount of plot-twisting in.  But usually, it's a straightforward story, well-told, with good description and excellent characterization carrying the momentum along.<br />Btw, at first Vanyel _is_ a brat.  No two ways about it.  However, he is redeemed -- partially -- by Tylendel (who might have done the full job had he had time), and later fully by Yfandes, his Companion, and his Aunt Savil (his teacher after Tylendel is killed).<br />The fact he has so much power, yet doesn't know how to use it effectively, and yet no one at first wants to believe it because he was and still is a brat, is _also_ very, very human.  It makes _sense_.  And it was a nice touch; too many fantasists would have made Vanyel immediately seen as lovable and pitiable because his lover killed himself.  Not so here, and the realism helps the momentum along.<br />The last third of the book deals with Vanyel learning how to control his magic while he realizes the love of his life is dead and gone forever.  Dealing with promise while dealing with pain _is_ difficult; it's damned difficult, and it's not a lightweight premise at all.<br />Anyone who thinks it is has _really_ missed the point of this book.<br />As for whether it's a gay-themed book or not, I'll say this: to me, at least, it's a _universally_ themed book, because just about everyone knows what love is, and can relate to losing a great love.<br />That is, if they can get past the same sex aspect, and if they're a fantasy reader, really, they should at least be able to do that in my not so humble opinion.<br />Great job, Ms. Lackey.	2003-06-15
US	32010417	R2QPV14UNUN8AN	0886777739	918015100	Oathblood (Vows and Honor, Book 3)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Actually, four and a half stars	\\"Oathblood\\" is a very good short story collection.<br />Some previous reviewers have been rather upset that two of the short stories were put into the original \\"Oathbound\\" book.  I'm not; I figured that Ms. Lackey needed to put all her short stories in one place, as they were originally published, for two reasons.<br />One, it helps fans get all the stories in one place.<br />Two, it helps to understand Tarma and Kethry chronologically if you're buying one of Ms. Lackey's books for the first time.  Not everyone who picked this book up had read anything about Tarma or Kethry before; Ms. Lackey basically had to do this.<br />Although I have nothing wrong with the \\"commercial\\" instinct some folks seem to be decrying, I really don't think that's what this was about.  (More than any other writer wanting to make a living, that is.  And really, what's wrong with that?)<br />Tarma is a super warrior with a twist; she's a Swordsworn votary of the Shin'a'in goddess, and as such, is \\"as neutral (sexually) as the blade she bears.\\"  (Hope that isn't too bad a paraphrase.)  She likes men personally, but has no interest or desire in them, and likes it that way due to a personal tragedy in her past.  (Plus, the Shin'a'in goddess takes people as her votaries for various reasons; they're all turned effectively neuter -- the Swordsworn, that is, not others -- so it's just as well Tarma had no real intention to marry after all that anyway.  She can't miss what she doesn't want.)<br />Kethry, on the other hand, is very beautiful, intelligent, spirited, and a strong magic user.  As Tarma's partner, originally you'd think they'd never get on.  But they do, and quite famously in every respect.<br />These stories show how their relationship started, how it developed, and the last two stories show Kethry's family (sworn to help Tarma rebuild her lost clan of Tale'sedrin) and how they interact.<br />I really enjoyed the last two stories.  The one about Forst Reach and it's horses (and horsetalking) was very, very funny, and it featured the welcome return of Beaker and Jodi (now paired off) from \\"Oathbreakers.\\"  The very last story featured Jadrie, Kethry's firstborn daughter, and how she helped her mama and Tarma save her two best female friends.<br />Very uplifting story; very powerful in its own quiet way, and some of the best recent writing Ms. Lackey's done in the Valdemar and related seria since 1996. (\\"Exile's Honor\\" is also excellent.  I'm really looking forward to \\"Exile's Valor.\\")<br />I'd give this book five stars except for two things:  one, the other reviewer is correct that some of these stories were already available in \\"The Oathbound.\\"<br />But it's the second that really gets to me, and it's not Ms. Lackey's fault.  The second is this; why is the cover so odd?  Kethry doesn't look old enough (even if magic does delay the onset of full maturity, she should look older than _this_, and actually, she looks quite the little ... on the cover, doesn't she?), and Tarma looks too beautiful for her characterization.  And, more importantly, Tarma looks completely different than she did on the previous two books, \\"The Oathbound\\" and \\"Oathbreakers.\\"  (At least Kethry's face is the same.  Tarma's isn't.)<br />What was up with _that_?<br />Oh, and who's brilliant idea was it to show Warrl not as a wolf-like creature, but as a Siberian husky?<br />That's the main reason this book doesn't get five stars, and like I said, it had nothing to do with Ms. Lackey.  But, as it's a part of the book DAW put out, and I have no other way to complain about it, I'm doing so this way.<br />Anyway, if you come to this book cold (without reading any previous Tarma and Kethry books), you should be able to understand it.  But if you've read the other Tarma and Kethry books, you'll enjoy it more, no question.	2003-06-15

I really don't want to write the same review again, so let me try and sum up.<br />Other folks have gone over the plot; I'd just like to say these things:<br />Vanyel's biggest strength is his humanity.  The fact he is afraid to love Stefan after so many years of being alone is very realistic.  Also, the fact that Stefan had to try again and again and again to get Vanyel to open up to him was _also_ realistic.<br />Anyone throwing this book to the side because it features a gay couple is really missing out.  It's a fantastic, highly emotional book that deals with complex issues in a realistic fashion.<br />I highly disagree with anyone who thinks that because Vanyel has a lot of inner monologue and can't seem to make up his mind very quickly, he's not a good character.  He's a great character; yes, he's flawed, but so what?  It makes him more believable overall.<br />Not only that, I find it more than a bit sexist to say that Ms. Lackey's character shouldn't be so flawed, when George R.R. Martin is currently being revered for setting up a bunch of totally flawed \\"heroes\\" and truly revolting \\"villains\\" with semi-hearts-of-gold.  Why is it OK for Martin but not for Ms. Lackey?<br />Makes no sense to me.<br />Anyway, buy this book; it's one of the best books Ms. Lackey has ever written, it has more than one moral (about love, and courage under the face of adversity, and duty, and shared goals and dreams even if they don't totally prove out), it's very readable, and best of all, it shows that even the most dense people (the Ashkevrons) can eventually get the message regarding people that are out of the mainstream.<br />Gay people aren't any different than you or me.  Ms. Lackey was absolutely spot on in her characterization, and I think she did a great, fabulous job with this book.  I'd give it (and \\"Oathbreakers,\\" another of my all-time favorites) more than five stars if I could.	2003-06-15

Or so he thinks, until he goes through a series of adventures, finally overthrowing the wicked Darken Rahl at the end of WFR.<br />The fact that Richard is Darken's son through rape doesn't please Richard; worse, he's in love with Kahlan, the powerful Mother Confessor, and he wants to marry her.  He's already proven his power vanquishes hers (well, enough so she won't take him over during the act of mating, as they'd both feared during book 1).<br />But, because of politics, he's having trouble.  To put it mildly.<br />The strong points of the book were the relationship between Kahlan and Richard, whenever Zedd (aka Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander) shows up, and the fanatical loyalty of the remaining Mord-Sith.  The weak points include the politics; too much time is spent on this aspect, in my opinion, getting in the way.  Also, there are many hints and portents of things to come in following books, some of which do little to advance the action at this stage of the game.<br />\\"Stone of Tears\\" is good, though; it's by far better than the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth books in the series, but still weaker than the first book.  I hope Goodkind will find some way to return to the humanity and realism of the first two books soon, as the endless changes on the themes of politics, religion, and how they interrelate grew stale way before the middle of the third book.	2003-06-15

I will say, however, that to me, the best parts of the book are the Tarma-Kethry friendship, the Warrl-Tarma friendship, the Warrl-Jadrek friendship, and the strong, romantic marriage of Stefansen of Rethwellan and his wife Mertis. (I hope I'm remembering her name right; I can picture the page where she's introduced -- something about a \\"frank, soft gaze\\" and brown eyes and a crisp, competent manner.  But I'm really bad at remembering character names.)<br />In fact, although this book definitely is feminist (and well it should be, considering it's featuring a woman warrior and her fighting mage partner), I think the best part about it is how it shows real-life partnerships.<br />Marriage and family are valued commodities, here; not only do we have the Stefansen-Mertis pairing, there's the eventual Jadrek-Kethry pairing (which resurrects Tale'sedrin, as another reviewer so pithily said), the Sewan-Tresti union (Sewan is Lady Idra's second in command of the Sunhawks; Tresti is a Healing Priest of Shayana, because Shayana's devoteés make no difference between priest and priest_ess_), and Tarma's rapport with the children only adds to the \\"family values\\" theme.<br />Most people have missed this, because, once again, we're talking about a woman warrior, a _neuter_, a sworn votary of her goddess, and a woman fighting mage.<br />However, just because they are fighters, that doesn't mean they've forgotten what's important.  Love matters; friendship matters; honor matters.<br />Those three things are what drives the very real people who populate \\"Oathbreakers,\\" and it helps add a great deal of realism and depth.<br />Btw, some of what is shown here is very, very graphic; not so much the killing, but some of the aftermath of killing, along with a few other things.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this book for someone under the age of 12 or so; even then, it'd have to be an awfully mature 12 year old to understand some of what's going on, and not just be repulsed by it.<br />To conclude: this is my favorite book of all of Mercedes Lackey's output, mainly because it has everything.  It has a great plot, wonderful, believable characters (yet flawed and very human -- even if Warrl the neuter kyree would disagree with me), and a satisfying conclusion.<br />Definitely one of my favorite books.	2003-06-15

Her father made his money the hard way, and Susannah is used to thrift and good business.<br />However, Lord Hanford, for years, scrimped and saved and kept up appearances as best he could, until he snagged Susannah, a heiress.  At first, he didn't want to use her, but felt he must.  And Susannah, of course, needs to get away from what's left of her family, which sets up the problems endemic to the genre.<br />Hanford isn't the most likable of men. He makes some very bad mistakes, including selling off Susannah's prized home because it's in the &quot;unfashionable&quot; part of London without telling her, and believing the worst of Susannah most if not all of the time until the end.<br />What redeems Hanford from his own mistakes are three things: one, his mother, who originally hated Susannah without setting eyes on her because Susannah is a &quot;cit,&quot; changes her mind, and starts working _with_ her new daughter in law instead of against her.  Two, she wins over his younger brother over time (the romance between the brother-in-law and Susannah's sister Dinah helps some in this process), which helps to smooth the way.  Finally, Hanford realizes he's wrong, and confesses it, just as Susannah tries to make up to him (not that she should; she's just being overly nice in my 21st century opinion) by getting a book of his poems published.<br />Earlier, Laceby would have been most angry with Susannah; by the end, he's happy, because she supports him in his artistic endeavors, and he doesn't have to hide them from her any longer.  Best of all, he's accepted her thrifty ways, and learned to value her for herself, not just her dowry.<br />It's a very engaging read; not quite as good as &quot;Two of a Kind,&quot; but still, very, very good, and an excellent example of the genre.<br />Buy all the Rosemary Edghill books you can!	2003-06-12

She's made a mess of her London season, doesn't see the point to it anyway, and doesn't know what's about to hit her.<br />Poor Jack Barham.  Lord of a broken down manor, all but disinherited by his worthless father, he's fallen on hard times, and decided to live up (or down) to them.<br />They meet, and the fur flies.<br />That, in itself, would have been worth the price of admission.  However, the parallel love story between Juliette's cousin Anthony and Althea Fonthill is even funnier, in a tender, romantic fashion.  Those two had totally given up on romance, being almost too old for it (at least, Althea thought so; she constantly refers to herself as &quot;almost on the shelf&quot; and other such sobriquets), and Anthony had resigned himself to marrying the totally unsuitable Juliette (they don't really get on), because there's no one else.<br />Anthony and Althea's romance is what makes this a five star book; as they spar with each other, and find love in the most unlikely way, they try to help the star-crossed romance of Juliette and Jack, soon to be Duke of the ruined Owlsthorne estate.  Some of their help works; some doesn't.<br />But that's the way of Regencies, isn't it?  Lots of intrigue, lots of dialogue, lots of fluff -- usually.<br />Here, the realistic romance of Anthony and Althea balances the impetuous Juliette and the imperious Jack nicely, making this one of the best and most comprehensive Regencies I've ever read.<br />As I've said in other reviews of Ms. Edghill's work, she seems to be able to write anything, and do it with flair.<br />Buy this book, if you can find it.  You'll be glad you did.	2003-06-12

Which is why I _almost_ gave it four stars.<br />However, since I'm still new at this reviewing bit on Amazon, and I don't know how to give 3.5 stars, I'll give it 3 instead.<br />The main flaws in \\"Never After\\" are the extraneous wizards; they, at best, are caricatures.  I was hoping Lickiss would marry the odious stepsisters off to them; no such luck.  And the wicked fairy godmother turned me off, too; of course, I'm sure she was supposed to do that.<br />Still, making jokes about senility and spells that don't work just doesn't cut it with me, so her character just was a plain miss.<br />Contrary to most of the other reviewers, I liked Princess Vevila.  She was very smart, and I thought liked Rumplestiltskin immediately, because he saw her as _herself_.  That's a feminist fairy tale -- and the way Rumplestiltskin proposes to her, twice, _also_ was done in an enlightened way (he basically asks her if she wants to be bored, and promises that if she comes with him, she won't be).<br />Rumplestiltskin _is_ the best character in the book.  He's very funny, and I believed his motivations.<br />However, _most_ of the other minor characters were good; Prince A-whatever was callow but funny, the wizard that gets a spell put on him, M-whatever, was funnier after the spell was cast than before, and the other characters were reasonably well-drawn, too.  (I especially liked Prince A-whatever's family.  A solid lot.)<br />I think this is a good book; not a great book, but a good one.  I wish I knew how to give it 3.5 stars, because I really, really think that's what it deserves.<br />Don't expect great literature with this book, but _do_ expect entertainment, enjoyment, and something you might want to reread on a cold, wintry day with a cup of tea in your hand.	2003-06-12
US	32010417	R2PRN2ZGH7577T	0553298348	810915454	Resurrection	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Resurrection one of the best modern short SF novels	&quot;Resurrection,&quot; by Katharine Kerr, is one of the best short SF novels I've ever read.<br />Captain Tiffany Owens died -- twice -- and was brought back to life.  Yet nothing seems to fit; well, almost nothing.  Her cat remembers her; her family still loves her and shrugs off her strange behavior, and her fiancé is happy beyond words that his love survived, even if _not_ in one piece.<br />During her long stint in rehabilitation, Tiffany had come to terms with the odd, shifting sense of reality, and had blamed it on &quot;bad neural wiring.&quot;  As coma patients and people who've had horrific injuries have learned, the &quot;wiring&quot; doesn't always seem to match up with what one remembers of reality.<br />Or so Tiffany thought, until two strange men showed up.  One, an impossible Reb from an impossible place, tells her he wants her to be happy.  The other, an impossibly handsome man, tells her to go home -- to the Republic of California, what Tiffany's been assuming all this time was a fiction of her imagination.<br />But it's not.  It's real; the blast that killed her threw her from one dimension into another, and she was brought back to life _in the wrong Universe_.<br />The story is whether or not Tiffany will stay where she is, where everything feels subtly wrong -- or go home, where everyone is used to her being dead, and everyone has gone on with their lives.<br />It's an extremely compelling story, enlivened by lots of realistic behavior from coma and rehabilitation patients, and a good amount of humor.<br />Ms. Kerr is better known for her Deverry/Westlands saga than any of her science fiction.  Although I enjoy those books immensely, I think it's a shame those are what made her famous, and not this incredible novella.<br />This book deserved to win every award there was.  I still have no idea why it didn't; maybe it wasn't even nominated, for all I know, which is even _more_ a miscarriage and a travesty of justice.<br />Read this book, and enjoy it; let's hope it'll be reprinted soon, so my mostly worn out copy can be replaced.	2003-06-12

It has an interesting plot, a likable heroine (Rani Trader), and believable themes.  It even has a prince that is reminiscent of Poor Tom in King Lear, who rises to the occasion at the end.<br />I think I liked this book more because of the prince, Hal (with a much longer royal name), than I did because of Rani.  Still, Rani wasn't a bad character, exactly; too easily led in some ways, as when she killed the soldier, but not bad.<br />Btw, killing the soldier was a totally unexpected move; how could she have been that naive?  Trusting the Brotherhood, whether her last relation was in it or not, was not a smart move; she already knew Guildmistress Salina, who'd betrayed her much earlier in the book, was a member of the Brotherhood.  So, why do it?<br />That was one really bad, bad move, and a totally unexpected one.<br />The ending, however, was not as &quot;unexpected&quot; as I'd been led to believe by the color blurbs.  Basically, Hal had to do something; he liked Rani, knew she wasn't bad, and revealing himself as a sort of uber-guardian wasn't all that surprising to me.<br />Btw, the characterizations of the Touched (the casteless folks who run the streets, and who are treated terribly poorly) was spot-on; most people in the medieval era, as now, prefer not to think of those less fortunate than themselves.  Yet the Touched here are very, very believable, complex characters; hardly bums, they're trying for meaning in the only way open to them.<br />I'll definitely give the next &quot;Glasswright's&quot; book a try, because this book was a strong effort.  And, I want to see what happens to the new King Hal . . . he seemed to have enormous promise as a character.	2003-06-12

Instead, it's a space ship/space station from a long-dead culture, and the price of boarding is this: all that McIntyre thought he knew must be given up, because at best it's inaccurate, and at worst, it's totally wrong.<br />McIntyre doesn't have deep emotions, and in some senses is rather shallowly drawn.  He takes to life as Commander, later Emperor of the reborn culture, far too easily; the series of painful implants he undergoes, in order to live longer and be able to do more things (including interfacing with the computer systems as the onboard computer, Dahak, wishes), is explained fully, but Colin's discomfort at these passes far, far too quickly.<br />What could have been something for the ages becomes more standard space opera -- but that isn't bad.  By doing so, Weber allows himself the opportunity to play out a script in which the good guys, who'd fled the interstellar culture long ago, finally win, with McIntyre's help.<br />Of course, this is typical Weber; lots of people die, some for seemingly no reason at all.  This is realistic, as a whole lot of people die in wartime -- lots of whom know next to nothing about _why_ they're dying -- yet I wish it weren't so prevalent, here.<br />The best things about this book were the relationship between the older Horus and the younger McIntyre, and the budding relationship (that starts out abrasively, but moves somewhat quickly into acceptance, then love) between McIntyre and Horus's daughter, Jiltanith.  Those two relationships redeem McIntyre, and transform him into a more sympathetic, believable character.	2003-06-12

This is a terrific, fabulous, absolutely wonderful book, in which just about every possible fantasy genre is represented, and quite a few different styles are, too.<br />There's &quot;The Maltese Feline,&quot; humor and a detective send-up, all in one.  There's &quot;The Intersection of Anastasia Yeoman and Light,&quot; which shows how one woman's life could have been -- and could have been _again_.  Very, very powerful, as well as oddly moving.<br />And yet, there's more!<br />There's &quot;The Fairy Ring,&quot; truly an inspirational love story, as well as an unusual quest story/fairy tale; the Aesopian &quot;Two Gray Horses,&quot; in which a young man does the right thing and is rewarded -- but not as much as you'd think; &quot;Scandal,&quot; a story of swords and men -- but not quite the way you'd expect; and even a Boscobel League story, which harkens to the world &quot;The Shadow of Albion&quot; set up, where Silver Stick in Waiting makes the biggest mistake of his life, all to prevent his King from marrying a totally unsuitable woman.<br />And there's much more than this!<br />Let me put it this way; since receiving this book, I have read it four times.  I've enjoyed it more every single time.  And I think Ms. Edghill is one of the best s/f writers extant.<br />Go read this book already!	2003-06-11
US	32010417	R9HVQTCOF5VJ4	0743435362	671835748	The Warslayer	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good, funny, light twist on the Coming of Age premise	\\"The Warslayer\\" might as well be titled, \\"Glory McArdle comes of age.\\"  It's fast, funny, and tells a rousing story of mistaken identity, second chances, and for a woman who honestly believes in her own incompetence to find out she's wrong after all.<br />The story is as follows: Glory MacArdle is a former Olympic quality gymnast-turned-actress.  She's a TV actress, sort of a Xena set in the Elizabethan era, and she's good at what she does.  But she was picked more for her gymnastic ability than for her acting, and she wonders why people are making such a big deal of her, right before the Allimir mistake _her_ for her character.  Once taken from her familiar surroundings, Glory has a choice; she can go back home, and doom the Allimir to lingering death, or she can fight, even though she's not really competent.  (The Allimir have no other options; it's her or no one at all.)  It's a fairly standard \\"mistaken identity\\" ploy, but Ms. Edghill renders it much better than average because of the witty dialogue, strong characterization, pop culture references, and Glory's search for meaning.<br />One other reviewer said he found none of that.  Funny, I remember a dream sequence where Glory was facing her idealized self -- and the idealized self told her she was doing fine, and on the right road.  And I remember a whole lot of other stuff, where Glory tells the remaining Allimir about how she's not really competent to fight -- but then, realizing how incompetent the rest of them are, chooses to stay and fight _for_ them.  That shows strength of character; she could have just gone home.<br />Another reviewer was rather upset that Ms. Edghill had written this book, rather than another \\"Sword of Maiden's Tears\\" novel.  Considering how well this novel was written, I don't understand that.  This is not filler; it _is_ light, but it's not total fluff, and it does have a moral.  The bad guys lose, and the good guys win, despite the heroine's lack of belief in herself.  What's wrongwith that?<br />I think it's a triumph, mostly because it _is_ a departure.  And although this book could have been straight satire, and I'd have enjoyed it immensely due to Ms. Edghill's writing skills, I'm glad she didn't choose to do that.  Instead, she went for a real plot, with real, identifiable goals, and managed to get me to empathize with a young, thin, glamorous woman (when I'm anything but these things) because of Glory's search for inner meaning as well as her place in the world.  <br />Because Glory tries so hard to help the Allimir, even though she knows she's not competent, and because the plot is so well-executed by Ms. Edghill, I'd give this book at least four stars.  I'd give it four and a half, if there was a way to do that, because it is very deftly done, and more to the point, it shows how someone _can_ rise to the occasion -- with just the right impetus.<br />As for the sequel possibilities, it might be nice to see; if \\"Xena: Warrior Princess\\" can spin off all sorts of stuff, why can't Rosemary Edghill?<br />And the episode guide at the end was a very nice addition, too.  Gave me some extra chuckles, and that's always welcome.	2003-06-10
US	32010417	R3MV49P8RJ82AU	0451458656	63095133	Season of Sacrifice	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Not a comfortable book	I'm re-reviewing this story for a few reasons, and have adjusted the stars because I feel that this book is a shade under a 4 star effort -- but when it hits, it hits.<br />Here's the thing.  Alana Woodsinger talks with other Woodsinger's shades, and does magic in an unusual way, basically through an old, gnarled tree.  The tree is sacred to her people, and her job is not an easy one.  Many Woodsingers spend their lives alone, partly because their jobs are so all-encompassing, partly because of tradition (if you aren't married before you become selected to become a Woodsinger on the previous Woodsinger's death, you just don't get married).<br />However, Alana was picked young, so she really didn't get a choice.  Keep this in mind.  As Alana wrestles with the \\"old guard,\\" folks who really don't want anything to change, reivers come and carry off two young children, and cause massive upheaval in her village.  Some are injured, and a few are killed.  As these reivers had previously come in peace, no one tried to fight them until it was too late.<br />Alana vows to go after the children, and manages to first find them mentally, then go after them.  Along with her are two men, Landon, and Maddock, and one woman, Jobina.  Jobina's a healer, Maddock's a tracker, and Landon loves Alana chastely from a distance.<br />Meanwhile, the two kids, Reade and Maida, have been captured by the evil Duke Coren, who schemes to use them to bring back and older, deadlier form of the state religion.  Reade quickly falls under Coren's spell, and Maida follows.<br />The two kids, after brainwashing, decide to do Coren's bidding, sort of because of something similar to Stockholm Syndrome.  Thing is, the kids are so odious from the start that when they become threatened by a large snake called \\"the Mothersnake,\\" which plays a part in the ritual that will kill them after they're about to become the most powerful (for a brief instant) religious figures in the world, I didn't really care as muchabout them as I think Ms. Klasky would have wished.<br />In addition, Landon dies, which was a shame; Alana had feelings for him.  Maddock and Jobina had started a brief, tempestuous relationship, but Maddock ends up breaking it off for various reasons.  When they get to the city the kids are being held at, they split up.  Jobina gets taken by the evil Duke, and falls under his spell as well.  It's not psionic; rather, it appears to be \\"the cult of personality,\\" for lack of a better term.  Duke Coren is charismatic.<br />The rest of the story I don't want to spoil for you.  Which is why I'll stop the review here.<br />The main reason for the newly adjusted rating is that the characters' plight in and of itself is drawn well.  I've been thinking about this review for at least a month, and realized that if a story can disturb me this much, maybe there's something to it.  Maybe it means the writer didn't fail after all; I definitely saw the points she was making, that people change (as Alana does end up marrying Maddock), customs change, kids need to be protected because they often can't make good decisions, and about the loss of innocence in more than one way.<br />Which is why I've upped the rating after a re-read of this story.  Bottom line is, Ms. Klasky made her points.  No, this is not a comfortable book.  It doesn't make you feel really good about many things at the end, but then again, Ms. Klasky's main strength as an author, as I know from the Glasswright saga, is in writing ambiguity.  She did that very well here; her characters grow and change, and even though they don't always grow and change in the way I'd like them to do, that's honest.  It makes them more life-like, not less.<br />And although it's not a book I'd ever seek out for a pleasure-read, I think it has strengths.  People are worth fighting for, even if they're odious.  Even if they've bought into propaganda, and even if they don't want you to fight for them.<br />And because of that, and because of me seeing that, I've decided to up the rating to just under four stars, and give it a recommended tag.<br />Barb Caffrey	2003-06-09

The novels are almost always fresh, involving, funny, incisive, and interesting.<br />This tried to be those, but fell flat.<br />Perhaps it's due to the subject matter.  &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is tough to retell; setting it in late 19th Century England might be involving and interesting in and of itself, but the romance must be believable.  And yet, this one wasn't; Marina should have fallen in love with the Vicar, not the Doctor, if she had to fall in love with anyone at all.<br />Some other reviewers have pointed out the plot holes and consistency errors from other Elemental Masters novels.  I don't see the need to go into them again.<br />I will say that the only reason this book even gets two stars is because of how well Ms. Lackey drew Margherita, her husband Sebastian, and her brother Thomas.  Those three carried the first half of the book, and I really liked it while they were involved.<br />Then, after they left, I was left with Marina -- someone who supposedly loves fashion but hates corsets, and dwells on every single dress she owns or sees.  And I'm supposed to like her?  She seemed rather shallow at best; not stupid, precisely, but shallow.  Well-meaning but ignorant, perhaps.<br />Then, the scene that sets up her &quot;romance&quot; with Dr. Andrew was very contrived, too.  A girl, suffering from lead poisoning, gets away from Dr. Andrew's sanitarium/hospital, and Marina soothes the girl until Andrew takes her off her hands.  And although Marina does many unselfish things in the book, this does not really add to her likeability in any way, because there isn't enough oomph to her personality, somehow.<br />I liked Andrew, even though I thought Marina was the wrong woman for him.  (His nerves as seen by Marina at the end of the book were plausible; her not being concerned about marriage was plausible only because she's already been shown to be rather shallowly drawn.)<br />Only guess I have is that Ms. Lackey's turnaround time for this book was too short for her to give Marina a more well-rounded personality.  That, or I just disliked Marina, and she couldn't hold my interest after her guardians were taken out of the picture.<br />Oh, Arachne and Reggie did make terrible villains, too.  Boring; very, very boring.  A cardinal sin in villainy.<br />Too bad this book couldn't have been written through Sebastian and Margherita's eyes; also, it's a shame that Thomas' romance with Dr. Andrew's nurse wasn't given more time as well.  I'd rather have seen that than most of the last half of the book.<br />Btw, if you're looking for a good book, and you like urban fantasy, go read &quot;Spirits White as Lightning.&quot;  That one is by Ms. Lackey and another of my favorite authors, Rosemary Edghill, and is everything this book isn't.	2003-06-09

It's very difficult to believe at first that one person can write in so many different styles, as there are quest stories here, fantasies, humorous fantasies, alternate historicals (of a sort), and many more.  The earthshattering fantasy of &quot;Prince of Exiles&quot; and &quot;Scandal&quot; makes way for the more lighthearted &quot;The Maltese Feline,&quot; stopping for the extraordinary fairy tale &quot;The Fairy Ring.&quot;  And there's much, much more; the Aesopian &quot;Two Gray Horses,&quot; the alternate-history (personal) &quot;The Intersection of Anastasia Yeoman and Light,&quot; the alternate-history overtones in &quot;May Eve,&quot; and even a return to the Boscobel League (featured in Ms. Edghill's novels with Andre Norton, &quot;Leopard in Exile&quot; and &quot;Shadow of Albion&quot;), where Silver Stick in Waiting makes the biggest mistake of his career, in trying to prevent . . . well, you'll see.  Ms. Edghill's writing career has spanned several genres, including Regency romance, science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and probably more I'm forgetting at the moment.  And her short story collection reflects the same broad-based appeal as her novels, being as there are several wonderful stories almost too tough to classify except as the general, &quot;Read this!&quot;  Now, I've read this collection at least four times so far (one of these days, I might share, but not just yet), and I enjoy it more every time.

(In a good way.)<br />Ms. Edghill's writing is incisive, witty, amusing, and involving; she explains what's going on so well that you almost don't notice how she gets everything (and I do mean _everything_ right).<br />Bast (aka Karen Hightower) is a bright, tough woman; she reminds me a lot of the women I knew while going to college.  She's a young, urban professional -- except she doesn't make much money, and she's a practicing Wiccan.<br />So what?  She's funny, acerbic, witty, complains about her sex life, and makes lots of great sarcastic cracks.<br />I'd like this book even if it were about Moral Majority types (although I'm glad it's not), if Ms. Edghill had found so much of interest to say about them.<br />That being said, it's really a shame this book (the compilation) hasn't sold a whole lot more, as there are lots of people who need to read it (as well as those who'd just plain enjoy it).<br />We can only hope it sells so much that Tor will want to resurrect the series at a later date.<br />Go buy this book already!	2003-06-09

Worse even than the usual, \\"He's from this time; I'm from the 20th Century!\\" ones that are endemic to the time travel romance genre, Shadow may or may not be one of the elusive Sidhe -- and as such, Diana feels honorbound to protect him (as well as love him).<br />Will she choose comfort over love?  If you pick the former, you haven't read too many time-travel romances.  Yet, the way it is done is unusually perceptive.<br />Oh, I also want to give kudos to Ms. Edghill for finding some very, very interesting ways to explain the sexual act -- ones that added to the depth of sexual tension between the two.  Not many writers can write love scenes without overly explicit graphic dialogue; Ms. Edghill is one of the few who can.  That alone would make this book worth the price; the historical accuracy, incisive and amusing dialogue, and wonderful characterization is an added, welcome bonus.<br />Buy this book!

This book, \\"A Crown Disowned,\\" suffers from too many plot discontinuities, bad characterization, very cardboard, wooden dialogue, and manages to do something I never had done in all the years I've read books -- made me want to throw a book Andre Norton has contributed to across the room.<br />Let me try and explain.  Basically, in the previous two books, Ashen was a sympathetic character (although toward the end of book two, she started becoming less sympathetic, as she did not like her stepson's girlfriend).  However, in this book, Ashen seems rather pointless.  The action doesn't really revolve around her -- it revolves around Queen Ysa, who at best is a tragic heroine.  Ashen's romance, which was one of the focal points of the first two books, is an afterthought here, and her daughter's romance with the young boy-king seemed tacked-on hurriedly.<br />Plus, there's no real sense of how time is passing in this book.  There seem to be very few time referents, which is extremely strange.  I thought it was probably due to poor editing or the rush to get this book to the printers, as I couldn't understand why else it'd happen.<br />The big confrontation loses all steam once the big bad Flavielle is gone, and considering she's taken out more by incompetence than anything, that's a major waste of resources.  Personally, I'd rather have seen someone deliberately succeed in taking her out, rather than the drugged, half-feverish way it's done in this book.<br />Basically, I didn't care about any of the characters at the end of this book, and I was glad the book was over (even though I'd really looked forward to it, and had enjoyed the first two books of the series).  Like I said, it's probably one of the worst books I've read in a long time, and I regret paying hardcover price for it.<br />If I could give this less than one star, I would, despite my high respect for Ms. Norton and her stature in the field.	2003-05-28
