Otherwise, your second best option is to listen to Noam Chomsky.  Chomsky knows an incredible amount of information and is brilliant at analyzing it.  He does so without any theory or pretense, using a vocabulary that any high school graduate has mastered.<br /><br />Sitting down and talking to Noam Chomsky at length about current affairs has to be one of the most illuminating experiences going.  But, what if you got the chance to do that and couldn't always think of the best questions or cite the best examples for Noam to comment on?<br /><br />Not to worry: David Barsamian has conducted a series of interviews with Chomsky between March 2003 and February 2005, and has consistently asked penetrating and provocative questions.  These interviews have just been published in this book.	2005-09-29

The U.S. media has refused to give serious coverage to the Downing Street Memos on the grounds that they are \\"old news.\\"  In the initial pages of his book, and supplemented by the rest, Solomon makes a case that both outdoes and undoes that claim.<br /><br />Solomon outdoes the \\"old news\\" claim by providing evidence that the Bush Administration's campaign to take the country to war in Iraq on the basis of lies was remarkably similar to President Lyndon Johnson's use of the media when he wanted to attack the Dominican Republic and Reagan's when he was inclined to invade Grenada, not to mention Bush the First's when Panama was his chosen victim.  In fact, Solomon draws disturbing parallels to Johnson and Nixon's lies about Vietnam, Reagan's about Libya and Lebanon, Bush the First's about the First Gulf War and about Haiti, Clinton's about Haiti, Yugoslavia, the Sudan, Afghanistan, and Somalia, and Bush Jr.'s all too recent lies about Afghanistan.  There just doesn't seem to be anything new about a president taking this country to war on the basis of laughably bad lies that anyone who was paying attention never fell for.<br /><br />Solomon undoes the \\"old news\\" claim by documenting how hard the media has always made it for people to be paying proper attention.  Not only are the Downing Street Memos not old news to most American media consumers, who've never been told what's in them, but the facts about many past wars are still not known to much of the country.  The Washington Post has never apologized for or retracted the Jessica Lynch fictionalization, but that itself is nothing new.  Solomon writes:<br /><br />\\"In July 1998 I asked a number of Washington Post staffers whether the newspaper ever retracted its Gulf of Tonkin reporting.  Finally, the trail led to someone with a definitive answer.  'I can assure you that there was never any retraction,' said Murrey Marder, a reporter who wrote much of the Washington Post's political coverage of Tonkin Gulf events in August 1964.  He added: 'If you were making a retraction, you'd have to make a retraction of virtually everyone's entire coverage of the Vietnam War.'\\"<br /><br />The Washington Post further distinguishes itself in Solomon's account of past media coverage of wars with this opinion it published when Martin Luther King Jr. spoke out against the Vietnam War:<br /><br />\\"King has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\\"<br /><br />Damn liberal media!<br /><br />Of course, many of the facts that Solomon employs in his critique of the media's role as megaphone for presidential warmongering falsehoods come from the media.  But they come from passing stories in lower paragraphs on back pages, not from endlessly repeated headlines and sound bites.  Solomon does not present a lot of new information in his book, but by gathering together key facts from extensive research he performs the reporting that he criticizes the media for failing to have done.<br /><br />A good analogy for much of the U.S. media's coverage of war, I think, is the coverage Samuel Eliot Morison, the Harvard historian, gave to Columbus in a text book critiqued by Howard Zinn in the opening pages of \\"A People's History of the United States.\\"  Zinn writes:<br /><br />\\"One can lie outright about the past.  Or one can omit facts which might lead to unacceptable conclusions.  Morison does neither.  He refuses to lie about Columbus.  He does not omit the story of mass murder; indeed he describes it with the harshest word one can use: genocide.<br /><br />\\"But he does something else - he mentions the truth quickly and goes on to other things more important to him.  Outright lying or quiet omission takes the risk of discovery which, when made, might arouse the reader to rebel against the writer.  To state the facts, however, and then to bury them in a mass of other information is to say to the reader with a certain infectious calm: yes, mass murdertook place, but it's not that important - it should way very little in our final judgments; it should affect very little what we do in the world....<br /><br />\\"To emphasize the heroism of Columbus and his successors as navigators and discoverers, and to deemphasize their genocide, is not a technical necessity but an ideological choice.\\"<br /><br />Of course, there's plenty of lying outright in the US media's coverage of wars, but there's a lot more Morisonizing.<br /><br />Solomon's book is not a chronology and does not have any plot that progresses from event to event.  Nor is it organized in a predictable manner around an argument.  In fact, it reads a little like a book written by someone who's used to writing 700-word columns.  But that is, of course, something that Solomon does with a brilliance that is seldom surpassed.  And, while there is something I prefer about his columns, this book doesn't fall far short of brilliant itself.<br /><br />It's organized by a series of statements often made by our media pundits.  These serve as chapter headings.  If they strike you as false and damaging, this book will provide you with the ammunition to refute them.  In that way, this is a resource book that can be regularly consulted.  If any of the statements strike you as true, then you really must read this book.

He did so in order to violate international law.  This is what Eric Zuesse argues in \\"Iraq War, the Truth,\\" a 188-page book from Delphic Press.<br /><br />The book is better than its title or its preface.  Zuesse makes a case that Bush's central motivation in launching this war was to render the United Nations and the International Criminal Court powerless.  Bush didn't attack and occupy Iraq in order to eliminate weapons that he already knew didn't exist.  And looting the oil and other resources (and the US Treasury) for corporate cronies was a side benefit.  Attacking in violation of international law, and using napalm and depleted uranium in the attack, was not a regrettable circumstance to Bush.  He would not have preferred to have UN backing, because his primary enemy was never Saddam Hussein; it was the United Nations.  What about \\"liberating the Iraqis\\"?  Bush believed that one.  He didn't expect the Iraqis to continue resisting.  But that wasn't why he started the war.<br /><br />All right, but why would someone waste tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars getting into a predictable mess merely for the thrill of violating a law?  Because this was no ordinary thrill for our born again White House occupant.  This was a holy thrill.  This was paying Jesus back for saving W from alcohol and drugs.  This was the culmination of a fundamentalist Christian crusade on behalf of God's law in opposition to merely human law.  This war has been building steadily since the founding of the John Birch Society.  This is a war with God on Bush's side, fought for a righteous and holy American empire.  God's law, the law of the conqueror, the Almighty, must be proclaimed sovereign over the blasphemous pretenses of men who would seek to write their own laws, international or national.  But the international laws must be destroyed first.<br /><br />The last 50 pages or so of Zuesse's book make the case that this is how Bush thinks.  But first, Zuesse lays out the clearest and most honest summary I have seen of how this war was begun, how the U.S. media promoted it, and how the U.S. public was deceived.  There's a detailed analysis here of some of Bush's most patent lies and the case that can be made out of them for impeachment.<br /><br />There's also a critique of the opposition to the war.  Zuesse believes that the US antiwar movement failed to pick up on international boycotts of US brand products because these were \\"crass commercial concerns.\\"  I don't think so.  I think opponents of the war were too eager to be \\"patriotic.\\"  My analysis parallels Zuesse's own of why, in his words, \\"religious liberals don't understand what they are up against, because they're up against religion; they are up against something that's within themselves.\\"<br /><br />According to Zuesse, the US attack on Afghanistan was too widely viewed in the world as justified.  \\"Not so the invasion of Iraq.  Invading that country would be sufficiently illegal to establish the necessary precedent that the United States stands above (merely Man-made) international law, and yet it was still sufficiently arguable within the prevailing WMD context so that it might be able to pass the legal 'smell test' of the international community.  It was therefore uniquely qualified to serve this bigger strategic purpose of establishing a precedent that would destroy Man-made international Law and establish the global reign of 'God's Law.'\\"<br /><br />Zuesse believes that if the International Criminal Court (ICC) does not act quickly to try Bush as a war criminal, then Bush will have successfully destroyed the court before it could get started.  A trial of Bush, in absentia, without seizing or punishing him, and even failing to convict him, would be enough to save the court, Zuesse thinks.  It's not clear to me, however, how much of such a trial the US media would report.  Zuesse's plan, in fact, would be to try them next:<br /><br />\\"People such as Rupert Murdoch (all 175 of whose newspapers editorially supported this illegal invasion and followed through with pro-invasion news reporting on it) can be tried for propagandizing war crimes and the internationally recognized 'crime of aggression' (i.e. illegal invasion), upon the same grounds for which Herr Goebbels is now universally detested, and for which the leading Nazi industrialists were likewise imprisoned.\\"  Now that's a strategy for Fox-bashing that I can get behind!<br /><br />Zuesse concludes his book with this tip: \\"The public information officer of the ICC can be reached at pio@icc-cpi.int.fact, would be to try them next: <br /> <br />\\"People such as Rupert Murdoch (all 175 of whose newspapers editorially supported this illegal invasion and followed through with pro-invasion news reporting on it) can be tried for propagandizing war crimes and the internationally recognized 'crime of aggression' (i.e. illegal invasion), upon the same grounds for which Herr Goebbels is now universally detested, and for which the leading Nazi industrialists were likewise imprisoned.\\"  Now that's a strategy for Fox-bashing that I can get behind! <br /> <br />Zuesse concludes his book with this tip: \\"The public information officer of the ICC can be reached at pio@icc-cpi.int.	2005-01-14

None of this has been seen on the network news or read about in the corporate transcriptions of Pentagon PR that pass for newspapers in the United States.  Yet much of it will be familiar - primarily from movies based on the war on Vietnam.<br /><br />Through Parenti's well-told accounts of people and events, we see the horrors and blunders of war, the cruelty that can result from a language barrier, the trigger-happy fear, the pharmaceutical-induced courage, the bureaucratic nightmare for victims' families, the sociopathic humor of the deeply disturbed, and the conflicts between the corporate profiteers and decision makers and the U.S. National Guard troops brought in to do their bidding.<br /><br />Parenti is a talented writer and observer, and he throws in asides about his own exploits that can occasionally seem out of place but serve as comic relief, bits that could have come from Hunter S. Thompson or Henry Miller.  So, the book is entertaining.  It's also honest - about the suffering caused by the Saddam Hussein regime, by those who have replaced it, and by the resistance.<br /><br />If anything were to change the minds of those Americans still supporting this war - short of persuading television news to show images of what war does to human flesh and human families - it would be an account like this of what life is like on the ground in Iraq.  But I'm afraid this account may not reach as many people as it otherwise might, because the dust-jacket and the early pages label this a book from the \\"liberal elite.\\"<br /><br />Parenti's preface says: \\"I have chosen descriptive reportage over a more analytical approach for a number of reasons.  One is the surfeit of already existing radical analyses of the Iraq debacle....\\"  Fine, but couldn't this explanation have come in an afterword?  And, then, couldn't it have been followed more strictly?  The few bits of analysis that slip into the book are mostly found toward the beginning and could have been moved to the end.  The book could have opened with narrative and been packaged as simply an account of what's happening in Iraq.  Instead, the dust-jacket carries praise from various lefties, a description of the book as an account of disastrously bad planning, and this quote from a Baghdad resident:<br /><br />\\"Ah, the freedom.  Look, we have the gas-line freedom, the looting freedom, the killing freedom, the rape freedom, the hash-smoking freedom.  I don't know what to do with all this freedom.\\"<br /><br />That quote could have appeared in its place in the book, following descriptions that would have made it comprehensible to red staters who support their president.<br /><br />What did Parenti hope to accomplish with this book?  It's not clear that he believes in the possibility of convincing anyone of anything they do not already agree with.  He describes U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq as wondering what the war is for but having no answers:<br /><br />\\"Talking to these young soldiers, I begin to feel that many of them didn't have the skills to answer their own questions.  They have satellite TV and internet access, but putting the bits and pieces together - some BBC here, a critical article from the Net there - is a rare thing on most military bases.  Usually the war is framed as patriotic duty or through the narrative of private personal trauma.\\"<br /><br />Parenti closes the book with a description of the intense struggle soldiers have fitting into peaceful society when they make it back to the Unites States.  And he finds no increase in the soldiers' understanding of the war:<br /><br />\\"This group of guys, recently forced to spend a year of their young lives fighting an imperial war with global implications, are politically mute.  They are neither pro-war, hopped up on patriotism, nor bitter, cynical and anti-war.  Even when prodded by my occasional questions they are reluctant, or unable, to discuss the larger politics of what they have just lived.\\"<br /><br />All right, but what if a greater effort were made than occasional questions?  What if a serious discussion were to follow the reading of this book?-war.

Setting aside Emerson's sexism, mysticism, and redundancy, I think he was onto something that Miller did not fully realize.<br /><br />It's not that I don't think pathetic self-indulgence and cruelty can be real experience and true truth. But I think that Miller went on writing and writing after he'd made his experience quite clear and we might have benefited from hearing about someone else's.<br /><br />But how do you write someone else's story without inventing it, and more likely than not using a traditional third-person narrative? Well, one way would be to help people put their extraordinary experiences onto paper, collect them, arrange them, and publish a book richer than one person can create alone.<br /><br />This is what poet Jimmy Santiago Baca and the United Steelworkers of America have done in \\"The Heat.\\" The book collects about 30 short stories and a handful of poems, all written by steelworkers who participated in writing workshops with Baca.<br /><br />Several of the stories are chillingly powerful. Some will make you cry. All are concisely and brilliantly written. Together they tell us of the lives of steelworkers inside and outside of the steel mills. We come to understand the prison-gate that slams on a young person reluctantly choosing to enter the mill. We appreciate the camaraderie and good humor of workers in a grueling and dangerous workplace. We come to understand the selfless heroism of some of these workers in their families and friendships, the traditions passed down through generations of steelworkers, the grappling with forces outside the workers' control, and the tragic regret that can face workers at the end of a career.<br /><br />Steelworkers are not glorified in this book, and the importance to them of their union is not touched on directly in most of the stories. The purpose of each story is not political but artistic. The result is a superb, entertaining, and optimistic collection. The Steelworkers union has helped dozens of its members develop into skilled communicators and shown us a view of their lives that we'll never find in newspaper reporting.<br /><br />I'd encourage every union to attempt the same.face workers at the end of a career.  <br /> <br />Steelworkers are not glorified in this book, and the importance to them of their union is not touched on directly in most of the stories.

The introduction is in many ways a wonderful work of analysis.  The primary purpose it lays out for the book is establishing that radical criticism of for-profit media is not new or rare in this country, that, as in other countries, it has been around as long as mass media have.  The book accomplishes this purpose admirably, providing key samples of what is clearly a long and rich tradition.<br /><br />There is a rapidly growing media reform movement in the United States at present, one to which the authors of this book have contributed through their work for an organization called Free Press.  Many could be forgiven for imagining that popular revolt over concentration and abuse of media power is something new, or at least that it is growing because the concentration and abuse have become uniquely extreme.<br /><br />The review of history presented in this book suggests otherwise.  While providing useful insights for the contemporary media analyst and opportunities for the drawing of lessons out of past failures and successes, this collection also provides a great deal of frustration.  Here are all the familiar problems, in one form or another, stretching back for a century.  Here are all the familiar solutions -- and even more radical solutions that we dare not dream of today.  And here is an endless string of failures.  This book is well worth reading, but requires a certain fortitude.<br /><br />When Franklin Roosevelt ran for reelection following his first term, U.S. newspapers favored Alf Landon.  But Roosevelt used the radio to speak around the newspaper editors, and he won decisively.  (Will the internet ever perform a similar function?)  More than one media critic cited this election as an indictment of the press's failure to follow public opinion.  Indeed.  But a reader today is more likely to see in this episode evidence of a glorious era in which the public was able to ignore the commands of the press.<br /><br />At least one media critic excerpted in this book expressed concern in 1937 that FDR had won merely because he was a better speaker on the radio, thus revealing the danger that \\"a demagogue with dictatorial aspirations\\" might win some future election unless the newspapers gained the confidence of the public.  The assumption here seemed to be that newspapers could provide more substantive content than any candidate could provide through what were not yet called sound bites.<br /><br />Today U.S. newspapers avoid substantive content like the plague and devote much of their coverage to analysis of who delivers the better sound bites.  An argument could be made that the broadcast media have succeeded so far in eliminating substance from politics that the newspapers now follow along.<br /><br />However, FDR's fireside chats were not sound bites, but treatises, by today's standards.  It is not at all clear that he won for superficial reasons.  And the chief route by which substance squeezes its way through the media today is not in print but on C-Span, the cable network that employs camera crews mercifully devoid of commentators to transmit speeches and forums to viewers simply as the occur (though of course C-Span chooses which speeches to air and which not to).<br /><br />The fundamental difference between the election of 1936 and those of the late 20th century and early 21st century is not the form or conduct of the media, but the presence of a candidate like Roosevelt as the nominee of one of the two dominant parties.  Today's media would never allow a candidate who threatened corporate power to gain such a nomination.  Ralph Nader is effectively marginalized each time he runs.  Dennis Kucinich and Al Sharpton were shut out by the media in last year's Democratic primaries.  We learned more about their hair styles, their diets, their childhoods, than anything important - other than the \\"fact\\" that they were \\"fringe\\" and \\"vanity\\" candidates who didn't actually intend to win.  The media promoted Howard Dean (which helped to exclude Kucinich and Sharpton) and then turned on him so hard that his head is probably still spinning.  Who wouldn't trade this system for one that permitted the nomination of an FDR, regardless of how the media then treated the nominee?ere \\"fringe\\" and \\"vanity\\" candidates who didn't actually intend to win.

In fact, as Yale political scientist Robert Lane has documented, surveys have found Americans' assessment of their level of happiness declining significantly. The same is not the case in other developed countries.<br /><br /> The United States contains less than 5 percent of the world's population and spends 42 percent of the world's health care expenses, and yet Americans are less healthy than the residents of nearly every other wealthy nation and a few poor ones as well, as documented by Dr. Stephen Bezruchka of the University of Washington.<br /><br /> What's going on? We spend more on criminal justice and have more crime. How can that be? We're richer and have more poverty. Why is that?<br /><br /> Sam Pizzigati, author of a new book called &quot;Greed and Good,&quot; thinks he has both an answer and a solution to these and several other riddles. Pizzigati focuses on the extreme increase in inequality that the United States has seen over the past generation. The Federal Reserve Board has documented gains by America's wealthiest 1 percent of more than $2 trillion more than everyone in America's bottom 90 percent combined. We are now the most unequal wealthy nation on earth and have reversed the relationship we had to Europe when the founders of this country rejected aristocracy. Today Europeans come to the United States to marvel at the excesses of wealth beside shameful poverty.<br /><br /> Many of us would like to lift up those at the bottom. Few of us want to bring down those at the top. Pizzigati argues that you cannot do one without the other, because the super wealthy will always have the political power to avoid contributing to bringing the bottom up. This will leave it to the middle class to assist those less fortunate even as their own situations are slipping and their concept of success -- based on the lifestyles of the CEO-barons -- is being driven further out of reach. The middle class won't want to do this, and instead will support policies that benefit the super wealthy.<br /><br /> But the existence of the super wealthy, Pizzigati argues, has a long list of negative impacts on all of our lives. Get rid of vast concentrations of wealth, and all sorts of things happen, including lower murder rates, lower blood pressure, and lower housing prices. Or so says the extensively documented research gathered together in &quot;Greed and Good&quot;.<br /><br /> Take the few points I mentioned above: happiness, health, and crime. Research suggests that when people see their situations improving over time and when they see their situations as acceptable by the standard of those around them, they tend to be happy. We had this in the 1950s and 1960s, a period when working families prospered and income over $200,000 was taxed at roughly 90 percent.<br /><br /> Developed societies with the healthiest and longest living people, extensive research shows, are not those with the highest average wealth, but those with the greatest equality of wealth. Explanations for this fact vary from consideration of the levels of stress caused by economic insecurity, to the focusing of health care on plastic surgery and other luxuries at the expense of treatment of actual illnesses.<br /><br /> Research also shows that a country's murder rate varies with its inequality, not its overall wealth or its criminal justice spending.<br /><br /> Pizzigati proposes a new system of income tax that would lower taxes on 99 percent of Americans and allow the wealthiest 1 percent to lower their taxes by lobbying to raise the minimum wage.<br /><br /> Pizzigati calls his proposal the Ten Times Rule. It would work as follows. If your household brought in less than the income of two full-time minimum wage workers, you would pay no income tax. Above that level you would pay 1 percent. Above twice the minimum wage you would pay 2 percent. And so on up to 10 percent. Any income above 10 times the minimum would be taxed at 100 percent.<br /><br /> This would mean significantly lower taxes on 99 percent of us. It would also mean an economy focused on products for a once-again expanding middle class, rather than our new aristocracy. It would mean a country without what Senator John Edwards has called the two Americas.wice the minimum wage you would pay 2 percent. And so on up to 10 percent.

The argument with regard to free will is a somewhat original take on compatibilism - which is a longstanding position, all of Dennett's bluster about his groundbreaking scandalbraving notwithstanding.<br />Our point of view as living acting human beings is not the point of view of atoms or of gods and cannot be, need not be, and cannot even coherently be imagined to be.  If you want to get that point across to an intelligent, scientifically inclined clinger to metaphysics, mysticism, or their lord Jesus Christ, this might be an ideal book to give them.<br />That said, I have some quibbles with Dennett's approach.  He argues that an event can be determined but not inevitable, meaning not unavoidable (from the point of view of the agent involved), and he develops this point as something more than just a clever play on etymologies.  But he goes on throughout the book to discuss free will in solely negative terms as the ability to avoid things.  Why is there not one word on free will as the ability to create the new and unexpected?  Why is there not even a comment on avoiding failing to be brilliant or heroic?  In fact, Dennett uses forced confinement (as in a US prison cell) as an analogy for free will (we avoid child molestation by locking up people convicted of child molestation).  Further, Dennett focuses part of his discussion of \\"intuitions\\" regarding free will on anger and resentment.  Where in all of this is admiration, appreciation, self-satisfaction, gratification, or friendship?<br />Dennett leaves out much of what is valuable about free will.  Those who object to his compatibilism may use this fact against him.  I find compatibilism completely convincing but Dennett's view of life depressing.<br />Dennett clearly supports our habit of locking many people up in prisons, although he offers castration as a possible alternative for pedophiles.  But, while protecting children from pedophiles may have something to do with the will power of former pedophiles trying to change, it ought to be seen as a separate issue from retribution for guilt grounded in freely willed criminal behavior.<br />If we are going to be advanced enough to drop metaphysics, we should also be advanced enough to make our handling of crime forward looking, focused on reconciliation and restitution.

Labor and the Corporate Media,&quot; by Christopher Martin.<br />Reviewed by David Swanson<br />May 27, 2004<br /><br />I didn't need to be told that the corporate media do a horrendous job of covering organized labor.  What this book tells us that I have not seen analyzed so well elsewhere is what the thought processes look like that lead to this horrendous coverage.<br /><br />It's simple enough to observe that the media support capital and work against the concerns of workers.  But why are there exceptions to this rule?  And what are the thoughts going through a producer's head?  I am certain that few producers or editors routinely think to themselves &quot;Hey, here's a good way we can hurt workers.&quot;  It would hurt the members of the media themselves too much to think such thoughts.  What do they think instead?<br /><br />According to Christopher Martin, five main themes organize their thinking.  The first is that the consumer is king.  The media are able to cover labor disputes without touching on the workers' demands or difficulties and while blaming labor unions, through the simple guise of viewing all events from the point of view of the consumer.  For example, more attention is paid to tourists' travel delays than to the reasons airline employees have for going on strike.  And through the &quot;objective&quot; technique of quoting &quot;both sides&quot; without commenting on the accuracy of the claims, the media often manage to distort the facts, even though that is not what they think of themselves as aiming to do.  The direction in which they distort the facts is effected by the second and third themes.<br /><br />The second theme is that the process of production is none of the public's business.  The point of view that the media adopt is one of a consumer uninterested in how a product or service is produced and only interested in acquiring it as soon as possible for the lowest possible price.  This theme eliminates work - you know, that activity that most of us spend most of our time doing -- from the acceptable topics for our public discourse.<br /><br />Third, the economy is driven by great business leaders and entrepreneurs.  Because members of the media believe this, it makes sense for them to discuss a labor issue with a panel made up exclusively of owners and managers.  This is \\"fair and balanced\\" if you have convinced yourself of these themes.<br /><br />Fourth, the workplace is a meritocracy and those who run into trouble have no one to blame but themselves.  This thinking grants to all employers freedom from responsibility for how they treat workers.  If they treat workers harshly, the workers deserved it.  This must be so once you have accepted as an article of faith that the workplace is a meritocracy.<br /><br />Fifth, collective economic action is bad.  Members of the media think they are fair to everyone by being fair to them as individuals.  While collective action may benefit many individuals, our shapers of opinion have determined that it is unacceptable and convinced themselves that it causes inflation or disrupts consumer behavior or leads to violence.<br />Many members of the media will, I think, tell you that they believe these five propositions.  These are not the underlying Marxist machinations that drive our media.  Rather, these are what our \\"anchors\\" and \\"analysts\\" actually believe, more or less sincerely.<br />This book illustrates the uses of these five frames with well-documented and well-reported case studies of the media's reporting on four strikes, at General Motors, American Airlines, Major League Baseball, and United Parcel Service.<br />Martin concludes that the following steps should be taken:<br />\\"1. Workers and allies must protest visibly, vigorously, and strategically.<br />\\"2. Labor Unions should use a multifaceted approach.<br />\\"3. Labor Unions should utilize nonmainstream media.<br />\\"4. Labor unions should seek to maintain and encourage diversity in media ownership.\\"<br />All good points, and even better, Martin says that a high-profile daily labor publication should be created on the internet.  I think Martin is wrong to dismiss the question of whether to produce a hardcopy paper.  Many do not get their news from the Internet.  But starting online makes a lot of sense for financial reasons.ood points, and even better, Martin says that a high-profile daily labor publication should be created on the internet.

US	43735353	RW0LC7CYU6Y93	0870784803	385762678	Politics Moves Online: Campaigning and the Internet (Century Foundation Report)	Books	2	8	16	N	N	Demonstrably False	The internet has not yet reshaped politics in any fundamental way, and its failure to do so constitutes a powerful argument for reform of the television, newspaper, and radio media. In his recent book &quot;Politics Moves Online,&quot; George Washington University professor Michael Cornfield claims that &quot;the more activists a campaign ensnares in its network-on-the-Net, the more money and volunteer hours it will collect, and the more voters it will be able to reach through mass media and physical contacts.&quot;  This has come to sound like common sense, even old news.  But what sense this claim has is demonstrably false.<br />At no point during the recent Democratic primaries could you line up the nine or 10 campaigns in order by size of Email list or web traffic and see a better than chance correspondence to number of contributors, or total contributions, or number of mentions in the media -- and almost certainly not to number of volunteer hours worked - although I don't know how to measure that and doubt Cornfield does either.  It's not clear what he means by physical contacts.  If he means the size of crowds at candidate events, I suspect he is mistaken.  If he means volunteers meeting each other through MeetUps (or at least signing up and RSVPing to say they will do so, which is what can actually be measured), he's being tautological.  If he means winning votes, he's clearly wrong, even when looking at the one campaign he discusses, namely Howard Dean's.<br />The Dean campaign's internet presence was phenomenal and may have brought many people into active politics in a lasting way.  I hope so.  The grain of truth in the rule Cornfield expounds so carelessly is that the Dean campaign had the largest Email list, the most web traffic, the most money, the most volunteer hours, and the most media mentions.  But the media mentions preceded the internet growth that the Dean campaign handled so masterfully.  And when the media turned against the Dean campaign, the internet organizing couldn't withstand it - the campaign was mortally wounded in a matter of days.<br />The Kucinich campaign (for which I worked) had one of the largest (possibly second largest) Email lists, often had the second highest web traffic, for a while had the second largest MeetUps, had the highest percentage of small donors, had the second highest number of donors, but never even approached second place in total money or media mentions (not even media stories about Net campaigning), and certainly not in polls or votes.<br />Cornfield seems to believe that Net organizing somehow generates media coverage.  He said at a recent event at the National Press Club that the media paid attention to the amount of money Dean raised on the Internet.  But the media covers money no matter how it's raised.  And the media's coverage of Dean's internet prowess was simply one type of story the media could do on the candidate leading in the polls and money - a type of story that, like all of the media's favorite types of campaign stories, avoids policy positions.<br />I do not want to argue that the media created Dean's internet presence.  Several campaigns had good media coverage and never developed comparable use of the Net.  But it is equally clear that the Internet presence did not produce the media.  This can be shown by the timing of events and by comparison to other campaigns.<br />When Kucinich entered the race last Spring, it was not two weeks before the New York Times' Adam Nagourney suggested he had no chance.  To make sure that prediction held true, from March to May, 2003, Nagourney mentioned Kucinich 13 times and Dean 111 times.  Yet during those months, polls of registered Democrats showed the two candidates running so close that their levels of support were within the margin of error.  The three major television networks mentioned Dean 30 times in May and Kucinich not at all, although the April 23 Gallup poll had Dean at 5 percent and Kucinich at 3 percent.From then on, the coverage only got more unbalanced.  The polls, the money, and the tremendous Internet activism followed.  The media made Dean, and it unmade him again much more quickly - &quot;Yaaaahoooaugh!&quot;<br />Cornfield, like other commentators, is telling us the media's story about Dean, but the media always claims to be covering the campaigns it creates and reporting on the natural demise of the campaigns it destroys.  Cornfield has not looked closely at the matter himself.  He hasn't so much as glanced at any of the campaigns other than Dean's for purpose of comparison.  Or if he has, he doesn't say so in his book and didn't say so at the Press Club - where he did say that none of the campaigns' websites used discussion forums (as opposed to Email or blogs) to gain ideas from volunteers - although this was the source of most of the Kucinich campaign's organizing ideas.<br />Cornfield confesses in his book: &quot;My methods and approach have limitations.  Except for the survey research, I could not ascertain the representativeness of the evidence and testimony I encountered and collected.  In 'hanging out' with members of a community, I was susceptible to the biases attendant on 'going native'.&quot;  You don't say.<br />&quot;The Internet's time has, in fact, arrived in politics,&quot; Cornfield writes.  No, it hasn't.  I hope it does.  What the Internet has done thus far is demonstrate great power and then shown that power to be as nothing beside the decisive strength of the media.  Grasping that lesson would be as important for our democracy as the Internet's direct accomplishments may become.. From then on, the coverage only got more unbalanced.

US	43735353	R1O438CBWADQOO	0525948139	537228107	The President of Good and Evil: The Ethics of George W. Bush	Books	4	78	102	N	N	Great Resource - Poor Concluding Chapter	Because this book bends over backwards to be fair to Bush, it may make a good present of persuasion.  Giving a copy to a Republican friend might create a good deal of cognitive dissonance.  Bush comes off as a serious threat to the planet, and not the slightest exaggeration is used to make this case.<br />Ultimately, however, the book holds Bush to standards he would find alien, and charges him with inconsistency where he would no doubt insist there is none.  Not everyone will be converted, not withstanding Singer's references early and late in the book to rational argument and universal standards.<br />The first 200 of the 225 pages take us on a tour of Bush's ethical pronouncements and behavior, in search of consistency or meaning.  This is extremely well done, and each section constitutes a perfect primer on what is wrong with this president and why we need to vote him out.<br />Predictably, the contradictions are legion and the findings of hypocrisy plentiful.  At times, I wish Singer had focused less on Bush's hypocrisy than on the damage done by his behavior.<br />The one instance in which Singer goes beyond commonly accepted standards to critique an ethical problem in Bush's behavior that most Americans would let pass comes when he suggests that Bush's religious habits of thought constitute a handicap for someone in a position requiring a questioning and discerning mind.  Singer suggests that someone who bases his beliefs on faith may not be ideally qualified for a position of power.<br />Of course every other American president ever elected has been a theist, or at least a deist, or at least has professed to be.  But Bush is especially clear about connecting his religion to his decision-making process.  I find it credible that Bush's habits of faith deserve the credit Greg Thielmann, a proliferation expert who worked for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, gives them when he says, &quot;This administration has had a faith-based intelligence attitude: 'We know the answers, give us the intelligence to support those answers.'&quot;<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first 200 pages of Singer's book, although I longed for some development of what Singer thinks Bush's intentions actually are and whether he thinks Bush is a habitual liar as well as a failed utilitarian.  The last 25 pages provided a disappointing analysis.<br />Singer shows in this final chapter that Bush is not consistently basing his decisions on concern for individual rights or on utilitarian calculations or on Christianity.  He then suggests, in what seems to me a major cop-out, that Bush uses an &quot;intuitive ethic&quot; and &quot;follows his instincts.&quot;  But this tells us nothing about where those &quot;instincts&quot; came from or what they look like or which are stronger than others.  It gives us no indication of when Bush is telling us his honest motivations and when he is hiding them.  Nor does it explain patterns in Bush's behavior, such as his almost consistent favoritism toward the extremely wealthy and those who have given him money.<br />But Singer isn't through.  He goes on to argue that Bush strikes people who meet him as honest and good, and that Bush must either be a tremendous actor when he lies or (what Singer finds more probable) he must be the ignorant puppet of right-wing conspirators.  Singer argues that when Bush, for example, claims that Saddam Hussein wouldn't let inspectors into Iraq it demonstrates that Bush &quot;can hardly have had a firm grasp on the situation that he was supposedly directing.&quot;  Singer (mustering all the nuance of Bush's &quot;You're either with us or you're with the terrorists.&quot;) writes on the final page of the book: &quot;When Bush speaks about ethics, he is either sincere or he is insincere.&quot;<br />But it's just not that simple.  When Bush invents a fiction about Hussein not letting inspectors in, he knows that he and a servile corporate media have the power to rewrite history.  At the same time, to some limited extent, he undoubtedly believes what he is saying.  He is coached by his intellectual superiors, and he takes his statements seriously, but at the same time he knows which topics to avoid, when to change the conversation, and how to hedge on the hard points.  He does occasional interviews, after all.  He doesn't just read speeches.  People (including Bush) are far, far more complex than Singer gives them credit for.<br />The simple-minded conclusion to this book is especially surprising given Singer's critique of religion in the same book.  Singer understands that Bush is a sincere Christian, and even faults him for it.  Singer also understands that Bush is not consistently a Christian.  Yet, Singer does not piece together the fact that Bush's beliefs carry varying DEGREES of sincerity.<br />When people struggle with trying to &quot;have faith,&quot; they are choosing, as Blaise Pascal did openly, to believe something.  And this phenomenon is not unique to religion.  We choose to believe what we want to believe quite often and often fairly consciously.  Some are able to persuade themselves of their belief in paradise to the extent that they will fly airplanes into buildings.  Others are able, with a degree of honesty, to say they believe in Heaven, while still beign terrified of death.  There is no black and white here.  We cannot say that Bush is either sincere or insincere, either a brilliantly handled moron or an acting genius.<br />Bush is a liar who to various degrees has convinced himself of his various lies.  This means that he is a human being who can be held responsible for his actions and who could conceivably be persuaded to change his ways.  He is not purely a puppet whose imperialistic oil baron handlers could be seamlessly replaced by environmentally sensitive socialist handlers.

Anyone who uses their day off to attend a full-day session discussing the issues in the election will be paid $150.<br />Fishkin has conducted extensive deliberative polling -- sessions in which large groups representative of a society discuss a political issue in depth.  He's found that positions shift dramatically, though not necessarily in a predictable direction, as a result of these sessions, that these shifts are the result of increased knowledge, and that participants' new positions have staying power.<br />Ackerman and Fishkin argue that Deliberation Day would better inform and involve a woefully ignorant public, in part through the effects it would have on candidates, the media, activists, and political parties.  Testing a sound bite with a focus group would not predict its usefulness in winning over a public that would be deliberating the issue.  Politicians would be obliged to develop positions that could withstand examination and substantive debate.<br />Deliberation Day activities would begin with a live televised debate between candidates answering questions from participants in an advance deliberation session.  Written materials would also be provided by the candidates.  Deliberators would discuss the issues in groups of 15 and take questions to plenaries of 500 at which local representatives of each campaign would respond to questions.  Back in their smaller groups, deliberators would discuss their concerns further.<br />When I first heard of this idea, I loved it until I found out a televised debate would be involved.  Anyone who watched the Democratic primary debates this season knows how few topics are raised, how little substance is produced, and how biased the affairs are toward the candidates the media prefers.  I raised this concern with Ackerman, and he replied that his principal concern was that relying exclusively on written presentations would overly depress turnout.<br />I'm not sure I agree with that, but after reading this book I do agree with including the televised debate, provided it is not conducted by a media corporation with an interest in ratings and in the needs of major corporations, and provided it will - as the authors describe -- involve questions developed through the thoughtful dialogue of a large and representative group of citizens.  In fact, televising such a debate would be a significant experiment in and of itself, which if properly promoted and made available would likely accomplish a good bit of what Deliberation Day is intended to do.<br />The design of Deliberation Day is well conceived by the authors and spelled out clearly in 219 pages of detail, including cost and logistics.  I'm completely sold, but I have a few concerns.<br />First, how will the campaigns ensure that they have informed representatives in every location who can answer questions?  In the recent primaries, I represented one of the Democratic candidates in debates in which some of the candidates were represented by volunteers or staff who repeatedly had to say &quot;I'm sorry, I don't know where he stands on that.&quot;  This was the case even in a debate in which the questions had been provided a week ahead of time.  For Deliberation Day to work, the campaigns will have to take it seriously enough in its first run-through to organize a small army of better informed supporters.<br />Second, isn't the real issue the nominating processes, not the choice between the two nominees?  What will happen if we all become informed and discover that there isn't much difference between the two candidates, and they're both ignoring some of our concerns?  Will this force them to compete to meet our needs?  Will Deliberation Day lead primary voters to look for different strengths in candidates than they do now?  Or will a full frustrating day of deliberation confirm many people's current belief that there's no point in getting involved (except maybe for the $150)?  After all, people already support many positions that I find admirable and well-informed but that we can't get our government to enact to save our lives.<br />Third, what about third and fourth parties?  Ackerman and Fishkin largely avoid the topic and otherwise suggest that they would restrict candidates' involvement based proportionately on their parties' success in the previous election.  But some discussion is in order here.  If Deliberation Day can be expected to change many people's minds, is it not conceivable that they could make a third party actually viable?  Or is it more likely that this exercise in civic participation will force one or more of the two major parties to address the concerns that have led to the development of other parties?  I don't know, but I find the authors' avoidance of the topic uncharacteristically shortsighted.<br />Fourth, what makes this - any more than, say, media reform or campaign finance reform - something we can create in the absence of already having it in place?  The source of hope for egalitarian ideas these days seems to be starting locally and working up to the state and national levels.  Ackerman and Fishkin argue, however, that Deliberation Day must start with presidential campaigns, because the greatest number of people vote in those already.  They are convinced that a less than stellar debut for Deliberation Day would put an end to the project.  It's an excellent point, but not one I find a source for optimism.  Getting this into John Kerry's platform would persuade me.<br />That may not be as far-fetched as it sounds.  While Kerry avoids many issues on which he attempts a delicate balance intended to please all of the people all of the time, he also takes positions on complex issues that would benefit from discussion longer than 10 seconds.  A presidential challenger ought to commit to putting Deliberation Day in place for his reelection attempt.

I know she does a superb job because some years ago, when Washington had still not been pardoned but when things were looking hopeful, I researched this case and wrote a series of articles about it in the Culpeper News, the small-town paper in the town where Washington had been tried and convicted in January 1984.<br />Edds is a professional reporter and writes like one, with very little commentary on the facts. As a result, the facts speak very powerfully for themselves. And what commentary Edds does offer I agree with. But I would quibble a bit. The main point she tries to make is that the errors made in this case were not unusual but a part of the system, that while a series of extremely lucky circumstances led to Washington's exoneration, there are likely many innocents who will never be freed. So far, I agree. But Edds also suggests that no one did anything really egregiously wrong, that everyone just did their job in a flawed system and the result was tragic.<br />I beg to differ. Earl Washington was set up by the cruel and dishonest acts of the police and prosecutors. One of the policemen responsible for what happened in 1983 and 1984 is currently Sheriff of Culpeper, and Edds goes very easy on him. Read my articles and Edds' book and see what you think.<br />Yes, we need to reform the system, but we also need to hold individuals responsible, and ultimately this book has that effect.

It has convinced me of a number of things, including that I should call myself an egalitarian rather than a progressive and that we egalitarians should form Egalitarian Democratic Clubs within the Democratic Party.  With regard to Nader, it has convinced me that his third-party campaign in 2000 was misguided and that he should not attempt one now.<br />It is only very reluctantly that I can be convinced to blame Al Gore's loss on Nader.  My reasons for arguing otherwise have long included that Gore did not lose but only came close enough to losing to have the election stolen, that Gore came close to losing because he was a terrible candidate who, among other things, ignored the need to appeal to Nader's supporters, and that many of Nader's supporters were new voters who might have voted for no one had he not been on the ballot.<br />But the facts remain that Nader won more votes than the difference between Gore and Bush in more than one state, that Nader's predictions regarding Bush have proved disastrously wrong, and that Nader and his staffers made comments suggesting that defeating Gore was his intention (Domhoff cites a March 4, 2001, Philadelphia Inquirer article).<br />I have often been saddened to see egalitarians express more anger toward Nader than toward Bush.  But the case Domhoff makes is one for building coalitions and preventing infighting.  Domhoff suggests that had Nader run in the 2000 Democratic primaries and lost graciously, he could have significantly influenced Gore, helped Gore win, and begun the necessary task of reforming the Democratic Party.  Domhoff offers arguments drawing on the history of political parties in many countries to make a compelling case that reforming the Democratic party is much more likely to succeed than creating a powerful third party in the United States.<br />Domhoff points out that most of Nader's examples of cases in which third parties have influenced the US political agenda come from the nineteenth century, before the use of state primaries, which &quot;have been the main source of new programs since World War I.&quot;<br />Domhoff suggests that Nader might have won between 5 and 25 percent of the vote in every Democratic primary in 2000.  That might be right.  But I'm not sure he isn't overestimating voters' understanding of the system.  Domhoff makes a strong case that public citizen number one, Ralph Nader, lacks a basic understanding of what is possible in our political system.  Yet he assumes that Democratic primary voters understand the difference between a primary and a general election.<br />If that were the case, where would &quot;momentum&quot; come from?  Why would voters be backing centrist candidates more as their votes become less necessary for victory?  Why would people who support Dennis Kucinich's platform (which is quite similar to Nader's) and who believe Kucinich would be the strongest candidate against Bush choose to back Kerry in a primary based on his &quot;electability&quot;?  It seems to me possible that Nader would have ended up with totals as a Democrat not too much higher than what he got running as a Green.<br />I could be underestimating, however, if the 2000 experience is - as seems possible - a major cause of 2004 primary voters' passion for and confusion over &quot;electability.&quot;  Jesse Jackson did not face the same nonsensical spoiler arguments in primaries that have been faced by Kucinich and Al Sharpton.  If this misuse of a general election spoiler argument in a primary is a new phenomenon, the question of whether it will last seems critical.<br />Domhoff's book is not entirely about Nader.  He uses Nader's campaignas a jumping off point for laying out a program for egalitarian politics.  Domhoff proposes establishing egalitarian Democratic clubs (EDCs) to &quot;lay the basis for the future takeover of the party in the same way liberals [took over] the California state party with their California democratic clubs in the 1950s.&quot;  It would have been helpful for him to elaborate on how exactly to start these clubs.<br />But Domhoff does offer powerful insights into American politics and a general guide to what sort of movement is needed going forward.  He advocates reframing &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;working class&quot; struggles as &quot;egalitarian&quot; in order to be more descriptive and inclusive.<br />Domhoff also argues for a politics based on a market economy rather than &quot;central planning.&quot;  I think his notion that egalitarians lean toward promoting central planning is overstated if he means by it much more than the several cases in which he himself says non-market solutions work best.  But Domhoff makes an excellent point that &quot;research shows that markets need guidance from government to operate well, and that there is no inevitable trade-off between equality and efficiency, or between equality and freedom, within a market system.  More equality might even mean more efficiency, not less, and it can certainly mean more freedom for more people.&quot;  Promoting understanding of this point could work wonders to reverse policies that benefit only the wealthy but which others support in hopes of trickle-down effects.<br />One point that I wonder about in Domhoff's discussion of the economy is his support for the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Later in the book he praises the Living Wage Movement for, among other things, working through the market, but here he seems to suggest that an ideal solution to poverty is for the government to make up the difference between the poverty wages companies pay and a living wage.  This seems to place central planning ahead of market strategies unnecessarily, and in the process to risk discouraging work as well as disheartening workers.r's campaign as a jumping off point for laying out a program for egalitarian politics.

I doubt it. Jim Hightower couldn't read the side of a cereal box if you paid him, not without dragging in about 85 analogies and bits of wisdom his neighbor told him about how to relate to hogs and chickens. But by the time he was through improving on that cereal box, you'd be stomping your feet and clutching your sides to control the laughter, and in the process you'd have learned what nutrition was in the box, how it got there, and how much the people packing the boxes got paid for their labor.<br />Hightower's new book, \\"Thieves in High Places,\\" takes 200 pages to make about 200 important points using about 500 colorful metaphors, generating at least 400 belly laughs, and while you can read the thing in one evening, it'll stick with you for good.<br />For those who've read Hightower's earlier books \\"If the Gods Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates,\\" \\"There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road But Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos,\\" or his newsletter \\"The Hightower Lowdown,\\" or if you listen to his radio show or have heard him speak on his Rolling Thunder Down Home Democracy Tour, this book will not come as a huge surprise, but it may just be his best riffing and ranting yet, and you will enjoy it. For those new to Hightower, or even new to the idea that politics might be either useful or fun or both, get yourself a copy of this book and a quiet place where you can laugh out loud and think about it.<br />Much of this book, in fact, is explicitly addressed to people who have never been politically active before but who have finally gotten fed up enough to get involved. This book presents a case that the United States is moving toward fascism, and does so without exaggeration or hyperbole, does so in fact with gut wrenching humor and a prodding, inciting, encouraging call to get off our butts and fight back - now, before it's too late.<br />For those used to hearing this kind of talk or who work as political activists all the time, this book compares quite favorably to others that are out there - say Michael Moore's or Arianna Huffington's - and compiles in one place not just a superb collection of soundbites, but an immense arsenal of facts. You may even be surprised to discover that things are much worse than you've been told, but also that more Americans are already fighting back, that more of us get it than you have been willing to let yourself hope.<br />Hightower recounts a lot of grassroots successes, but he doesn't go easy on painting the disaster that is our current national government. Let me just mention a few high points (or low points). Pages 27 to 32 list in tiny font an endless stream of anti-environmental measures put in place thus far by the Bush administration. It's enough to make you start looking for another planet. Pages 57 to 62 make the currently quite important point that Joe Lieberman would not be much of a change.<br />Pages 81 to 88 lay out the even more important and less talked about case that the pit our money is being lost in - even more than it is being lost to the Bush tax cuts for millionaires - is the Pentagon budget, that over half of every tax dollar goes into this pit, and that other priorities, like schools, health care, and jobs, will take a back seat until limitations are imposed on military waste.<br />Pages 102-103 make the case quite compellingly that the Democratic Party has been on a losing course because it has tried to be Republican-Lite. Here's the Democratic bumper sticker according to Hightower:<br />\\"Hey-we-back-tax-cuts-for-the-rich-too-And-we-support-Bush's-war-and-also-his-Big-Honking-homeland-security-department-Though-we're-not-quite-as-sure-about-it-all-as-the-Republicans-are.\\"<br />Pages 106-107 lay out what a winning platform for the Democrats would be: progressive taxation, single-payer health care for all, free quality education for all from preschool through college, alternative energy, and public financing of elections. Of course, there is one Democrat running for President with that very program: Rep. Dennis Kucinich, and I kept waiting - in vain -- for Hightower to say so.<br />What Hightower does say - and this may be worth the price of the book by itself - is that these progressive positions are actually very popular. On pages 118-122, Hightower lays out a collection of mainstream public polls that paint a picture of Americans as very progressive - something Fox News just doesn't tell us. This could explain the number of people bewildered by the fact that not only they but all of their friends as well disagree with what Fox News tells them is the popular point of view.<br />The only complaint I have with this book is that it closes with a fantasy about a mythical presidential candidate who walks and talks remarkably like Jim Hightower. If Hightower wants to run for President, I'll support him, but I'd almost rather see him keep up just the sort of agitating he's been doing and back the candidate who is articulating the same positions from within the Democratic party, namely Dennis Kucinich.native energy, and public financing of elections.

The chapters are organized into three sections. The first eight articles deal with some fairly technical philosophical disputes, though often beginning and ending with more general comments. The next four address respectively human rights, cultural diversity, feminism, and the end of Leninism. These provide the most new material for a reader familiar with Rorty's other books. The last five are a rather strange mix, providing some interesting thoughts on history and on Derrida, while carrying Rorty's dubious dichotomy of \\"private\\" and \\"public\\" (developed in previous works) to what seem to this reader ever absurder and more tangled conclusions.<br />Readers familiar with Rorty's work will find more wonderful examples of it in this volume. New ideas can be found throughout, and some old ideas are here better developed. Some bad old ideas (such as some found in the final chapter of \\"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity,\\" criticized by Norman Geras in \\"Solidarity in the Conversation of Humankind; The Ungroundable Liberalism of Richard Rorty,\\") seem to have been dropped or developed into good ideas. And Rorty is unlikely to create many new opponents with this book, though he'll probably keep many of his old ones.<br />But old-hands at learning from Rorty may find the first section of this book a somewhat tiresome, if admirable and patient, reply to the same moral weakness in eight slightly different varieties. And newcomers may not find this book a good introduction to Rorty's thinking. For that purpose I am always inclined to recommend \\"Consequences of Pragmatism,\\" even though Rorty has changed his mind on many points in it - or perhaps partly for that very reason: it is easier to begin with the earlier Rorty and follow his progress chronologically.<br />I don't think that Rorty has yet written for a really popular audience, except perhaps in his new political book \\"Achieving Our Country,\\" and in some magazine articles too short to make important points in. I do think Rorty is far easier for many readers to understand than are Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, and various postmodernist writers, and easier also than Wittgenstein, Davidson or even Dewey. And I do not see that anything is sacrificed to achieve this clarity. I imagine I have spent more pleasurable time with books by Rorty than with those by any other author with the exception of Nietzsche. I might recommend this book as an introduction, not to Rorty, but to Davidson, who is frequently discussed in it.<br />Rorty sees his job largely as cleaning up the rough but radical work of more creative thinkers than he, cleaning up and popularizing. Rorty thinks that he belongs to (in Kuhnian terms) normal, as opposed to radical, philosophy, that he carries out projects devised by the REAL geniuses, and otherwise marks time until the next genius (namely Derrida) begins to be understood. I am not so sure.<br />Although I accept (at least as a rough outline) Kuhn's notion of paradigm shifts - the idea that a field progresses by asking new questions as well as by answering old ones - and although I agree with the emphasis Rorty places on the need for radical imaginative creation, I do not think that the lines are always crisp between radical and normal contributors (or even specific contributions) to a field. I am inclined to be a little suspicious of the surety with which Rorty thinks he can state whether something (a statement, much less a book) is an answer to an old question or the creation of a new one. This dichotomy is disturbingly similar to that of scheme-content so often convincingly dismissed by Davidson and Rorty. If statements cannot have forms and contents, then why should we be so sure it's a good idea to think of \\"questions\\" as forms awaiting the provision of their contents by \\"normal\\" workers until a new form is created? Having learned from Rorty to reduce such dichotomies to a matter of degree of utility, I interpret his claimthat he is only an underlaborer as no more than a quite honest, admirable, and probably very productive humility, with perhaps a pinch of anxiety-of-influence thrown in.<br />One theme brought out more prominently in this collection than in some previous ones is Rorty's desire to change the usage of certain words (such as \\"objective,\\" and the two words in the book's title) rather than discarding them altogether. If you are wondering why he should wish to do either, it may help to quote the first paragraph of his Introduction:<br />\\"'There is no truth.' What could that mean? Why should anybody say it?<br />\\"Actually, almost nobody (except Wallace Stevens) does say it. But philosophers like me are often said to say it. One can see why. For we have learned (from Nietzsche and James, among others) to be suspicious of the appearance-reality distinction. We think that there are many ways to talk about what is going on, and that none of them gets closer to the way things are in themselves than any other. We have no idea what 'in itself' is supposed to mean in the phrase 'reality as it is in itself.' So we suggest that the appearance-reality distinction be dropped in favor of more useful ways of talking. But since most people think that truth is correspondence to the way reality 'really is,' they think of us as denying the existence of truth.\\"<br />Another feature that stands out in this new collection is Rorty's terrific ability to pick out arguments by analogy to events long-passed. Often, rather than baldly claiming that rejecting a particular philosophical argument is a rejection of theology (as well as that said rejection is possible without disastrous consequences), Rorty points out the similarities between this rejection and one long-accepted.that he is only an underlaborer as no more than a quite honest, admirable, and probably very productive humility, with perhaps a pinch of anxiety-of-influence thrown in.<br />One theme brought out more prominently in this collection than in some previous ones is Rorty's desire to change the usage of certain words (such as \\"objective,\\" and the two words in the book's title) rather than discarding them altogether.

US	43735353	R2CVM7QNCEXBXV	0802775993	315939699	Dead Run: The Shocking Story of Dennis Stockton and Life on Death Row in America	Books	5	2	5	N	N	Important	This tells the story of an innocent man killed by the state of Virginia for political reasons, an event made easy and in all probability common by a law banning the reopening of a case to hear new evidence later than 21 days after a conviction.  This applies even to evidence illegally suppressed during the original trial.<br />The book is extremely well-written, and much of it is exciting and suspenseful, particularly that dealing with the escape.  Stockton was in on planning an escape from death row, but did not take part in it.  New evidence of his innocence had just emerged, and Stockton apparently had enough faith left in the justice system to believe that he stood a better chance of freedom by not escaping.  He may also have been driven by a desire to declare his innocence.  He later refused a deal from the state of life imprisonment in exchange for ceasing to appeal his conviction.  He also published diary entries in a newspaper which he knew would win him the ill-will of many with power over him.<br />This excellent book is marred slightly by the introduction's instructing us that \\"...there is no need to pity most criminals.\\"  Such a comment transfers its author's inability to pity to the rest of us.  I'd be curious to know how many readers of this book feel no pity for the escaped murderer who arrives at the border of Canada, grows scared, telephones his mother, and - on her advice - turns himself in to be killed.<br />More importantly, the comment about pity leaves the debates over criminal justice within the framework of a battle between vengeance and pity - a framework in which the reduction of harm done by and to both criminals and the falsely accused can have no place.<br />The vengeance-versus-pity idea shoves aside the question of innocence-versus-guilt, and even where guilt is evident it shoves aside questions of societal healing, restitution to victims, rehabilitation of offenders, deterrence, and costs to tax-payers.<br />Everyone knows that crime is most easily and cost-effectively reduced by fighting poverty.  It is unlikely that America's recent draconian measures will reduce crime in the long run.  Stockton chose to trust the system rather than attempt an escape, but he was relieved to be killed when the only alternative was the hell-hole known as a correctional institution, a place full of flying feces, rape, murder, and abuse of every sort.<br />Lately, Virginia has been doing to juveniles what it has long done to adults convicted of crimes.  The director of the dept. of juvenile justice [pun possibly intended] has resigned effective Dec. 1, 1999, following the death of a retarded youth in custody, the initiation of a self-defense program allowing guards to hit and kick kids, a girl being handcuffed on her way to a hospital to give birth, and poor conditions at the state's largest detention center so egregious that the agency's board decertified the place last week citing overcrowding and sexual misconduct.<br />Concern for convicts (innocent or not) is not in conflict with crime reduction.  It is in<br />conflict with state violence, with the anger promoted by politicians even in the names of victims who publicly disown it.  As long as advocates of vengeance are permitted<br />to masquerade as advocates of crime reduction, justice will be a sham.<br />This book is so well done that to find anything significant to complain about, I had to turn to the introduction, which the authors didn't write.  The authors are an editor and an ex-reporter for the Virginian-Pilot, a Norfolk newspaper.  Much of what they write is taken from Stockton's diary, transposed into the third person, fact-checked, and supplemented.  The only thing I could fault these talented writers for is the occasional misplaced journalistic balance.  The preface mentions \\"ultimate fairness - or lack thereof,\\" as if the whole point of the book were not to describe unfairness.  On page 19, the authors accept the term \\"monsters\\" as a useful one, without really defining what it should mean.  On page 234 of a book describing the Dantean conditions of a prison, they write of a victim's mother's dealing with the years before an innocent man was executed for her son's murder: \\"It was like she was in prison too.\\"  Maybe she had said those words, but had she read this book?  Did she have any idea what being in a prison is like?  On page 251 the authors say that Stockton was \\"witness to a struggle between justice and mercy.\\"  He wasn't.  He was witness to a struggle between evil politics and vengeance on the one hand, and the demands of innocence on the other.  Justice cannot be opposed to mercy because justice should be merciful.  Justice is, after all, an attempt - where all else has failed or not been tried - to reduce harm.<br />This book is not just an exciting page-turner.  It also provides a great deal of useful information, including some shocking statistics.  For example: \\"An October 1993 report by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee said that forty-eight innocent men had been freed from Death Rows across the nation since 1972,  That came to a nearly one-in-six ratio of freed to executed prisoners.  Of the forty-eight men, 52 percent 'were convicted on the basis of perjured testimony or because the prosecutor improperly withheld exculpatory evidence.'\\"  Is this surprising in a country with the bizarre practice of ELECTING prosecutors to office - and voting them out if they leave a crime unpunished?really defining what it should mean.

His was a Left superior, he believes, to today's academic Left in at least two ways: it wasted no time on theory so far removed from specific reform proposals as to be useless, and it saw anticommunism as an obvious leftist position.<br />Rorty longs for a politics inspired by Whitman and Dewey, one that acknowledges the mistakes made by America in the past - including the slaughter of Native Americans, the enslavement of blacks, the Vietnam War - but one that does not retreat into theorizing and imagine that the more abstract a theory is the more it becomes \\"subversive.\\" Rorty thinks we should acknowledge past and current flaws while actively working to make a better future, and that we should take pride in America if (as Rorty believes) that is what is needed to motivate action.<br />\\"The academic Left has no projects to propose to America, no vision of a country to be achieved by building a consensus on the need for specific reforms,\\" Rorty writes. \\"Emphasizing the continuity between Herbert Croly and Lyndon Johnson, between John Dewey and Martin Luther King, between Eugene Debs and Walter Reuther, would help us to recall a reformist Left which deserves not only respect but imitation - the best model available for the American Left in the coming century.\\" Rorty thinks that the current remains of the pre-Sixties reformist Left \\"consists largely of labor lawyers and labor organizers, congressional staffers, low-level bureaucrats hoping to rescue the welfare state from the Republicans, journalists, social workers, and people who work for foundations.\\"<br />Rorty sees Marxism as having done a great deal of harm: \\"The ideals of social democracy and economic justice . . . long antedated Marxism, and would have made much more headway had 'Marxism-Leninism' never been invented.\\" Marxism, Rorty believes, has contributed to the problems with the current academic Left. Academic leftists demand purity, and prefer bottom-up movements of \\"the people\\" where top-down efforts could help. They consider reformists sell-outs, although they do not have any specific revolution in mind and have merely resigned themselves to inaction. They concentrate on America's sins, and invent new theoretical Satans such as Foucault's \\"power\\" as justifications for hopelessness.<br />\\"[I]t would be a good thing,\\" Rorty writes, \\"if the next generation of American leftists found as little resonance in the names Karl Marx and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin as in those of Herbert Spencer and Benito Mussolini. It would be an even better thing if the names of Ely and Croly, Dreiser and Debs, A. Philip Randolph and John L. Lewis were more familiar to leftists than they were to the students of the Sixties.\\"<br />As Rorty tells the story, up through approximately 1964 the left concentrated on helping the poor, and after that point on helping those of oppressed races or gender. Rorty believes both the opposition to selfishness (which involved a lot of political action) and the opposition to sadism (which has involved mostly changes in cultural attitudes) have done a lot of good. He would like to see the two combined: \\"'The system' is sometimes identified as 'late capitalism,' but the cultural Left does not think much about what the alternatives to a market economy might be, or about how to combine political freedom with centralized economic decisionmaking. Nor does it spend much time asking whether Americans are undertaxed, or how much of a welfare state the country can afford, or whether the United States should back out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. . . . Nobody is setting up a program in unemployment studies, homeless studies, or trailer park studies, because the unemployed, the homeless, and residents of trailer parks are not 'other' in the relevant sense. . . . During the same period in which socially accepted sadism has steadily diminished, economic inequality and economic insecurity have steadily increased.\\"<br />What specific actions does Rorty advocate in this book demanding the advocating of specific actions? Very few, and I do not think that diminishes the value of the book. He does say that the top of the list must clearly be radical campaign finance reform. And he names a problem which he says will probably be our biggest, although he confesses he has no solution to it. The problem is this: \\"Globalization is producing a world economy in which an attempt by any one country to prevent the immiseration of its workers may result only in depriving them of employment.\\" A conflict has developed, in other words, between helping the poor of the world and helping the poor of America. Concentrating too much on the former, Rorty fears, will open the door to a Buchanan-type appeal to the poor of America, an appeal which will be false and will have disastrous results for America and the world.<br />Quibbles:<br />I do not need to feel pride in America to believe that reform should be worked for.<br />Henry Adams was not just a spectator who did nothing, he was also a lousy spectator.<br />I was very glad to see that Rorty thinks a democracy creates \\"larger, fuller, more imaginative and daring individuals.\\" I had thought he sided with McIntyre in believing democracy to be a compromise, creating mediocre people but avoiding more suffering. I think his new view is right.<br />It seems silly to me to claim that leftists want change and rightists do not. The right wants changes that make things worse.<br />The academic left does not exaggerate the importance of philosophy for politics, but as opposed to politics. Thought is important for politics, but thought that is engaged with politics.<br />Why is it that riches cannot wipe out sadism, but poverty is bound to produce it?<br />I don't believe we have what Rorty calls \\"individual quests for private perfection,\\" as something separate from our worldly lives.economic inequality and economic insecurity have steadily increased.\\"<br />What specific actions does Rorty advocate in this book demanding the advocating of specific actions?

US	43735353	R1KBKTWP6XJT4C	0300082606	585657307	The Stakeholder Society	Books	4	4	8	N	N	Brilliant and Flawed	In an outstanding new book called the Stake holder society, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott propose having the government give every American $80,000 in their early twenties.  This would be funded by a two percent tax on wealth above $80,000.  They also suggest a privilege tax on those who have had financially privileged childhoods.  These proposals are carefully thought out and well motivated by the idea of giving some substance to our common empty talk of \\"equality of opportunity.\\"<br />Ackerman and Alstott dismiss a number of other approaches, such as funding education better or raising minimum wages as too small and/or actually harmful  and/or politically difficult.  Unhappily, I'm inclined to think that their proposals are just as politically difficult.<br />And I have a quibble with the digs scattered through this book against \\"utilitarians,\\" who are never named.  As in all American ethical arguments, the example used is that of Nazi Germany, where Jews were one percent of the population.  \\"[I]s it so clear,\\" the authors ask, \\"that the average Jew suffered NINETY-NINE times as much as the average Aryan gained from his feelings of racial superiority?\\"<br />One response to this is that feelings like those often involve hatred, which, being unpleasant, is not a gain at all.  But, even accepting that there was a gain for many racists, the trade-off is not necessary.  The racists could have felt superior without killing anyone, an action which, if completed, would have deprived them of the allegedly beneficial presence of people they perceived as inferiors.<br />More importantly, these numbers (one and ninety-nine units of pleasure or suffering) do not mean anything.  We could give a vivid description of the concentration camps and then ask \\"Isn't it abundantly clear that the average Jew suffered at least ninety-nine times as much as the average Aryan gained from his feelings of racial superiority?\\"  The case for this \\"calculation\\" is exactly as good as for its opposite.<br />The value of utilitarianism lies not in calculations (calculations which Ackerman and Alstott accept while trying to dismiss) but in placing the well-being of people above adherence to any rule.  Utilitarianism ought to be an ally of anyone who recognizes the harm done by devotion to certain rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to engage in unfair and cruel labor practices, the \\"right to work\\", and the faith that people have what they \\"deserve.\\"<br />And don't get me started on the way readers of Foucault tend to characterize Bentham...<br />I've encountered two arguments against the Stake holder society.  The first, which is well addressed in the book, is that some people would waste their $80,000.  I agree with the authors that relatively few would waste their money, and that many would be much better off than they are now.  I find that people who make this criticism are not themselves suggesting an alternative remedy to the drastic disparity in wealth in America, and are not even aware of it.  In many cases, they profess a belief that there is no hunger in this country, that people only suffer if they don't work, and that everyone has a chance to make it.<br />The second argument I've encountered is that charity must be done \\"privately,\\" that is, without the government.  In some cases, advocates of private charity support huge organizations known for as much corruption and inefficiency as any government, real or imagined.  In other cases, they support only one-on-one charity without any intervening (or skilled, organized, or powerful) agency.  Often in supporting these charities, government -haters make clear that they do know that hunger exists in America, if not that people working 60 hours a week can qualify for food stamps (temporarily, of course).<br />Sometimes supporters of private charity argue that the way to help is to teach entrepreneurism, apparently oblivious to the pertinent absence of capital.  Other times they argue for simply giving fish instead of fishing skills.  After all, this is good for the giver, and the poor will always be with us.<br />Why do private and public charity need to be in conflict?  I give some tiny amounts to organizations and to people I meet on the street, and I simultaneously argue for living wage laws, campaign finance reform, an end to corporate welfare and waste on weapons, spies, highways, and subsidies for cutters of national forests.  I will  now argue for a Stake holder society without  feeling any conflict with dropping some canned food in a basket or helping build Habitat for Humanity houses.<br />If private charity were doing the job, no one would propose government charity (and vice versa).  And a lot of what is proposed amounts to government neutrality.  Many of our taxes are regressive.  Our services are unevenly distributed, notably in education.  And we have the money.  Just yesterday (May 6, 1999) we threw an extra $13 billion at the Pentagon.  That kind of money could end many debates over education by providing better schools in poor counties and cities.  Our cities routinely give huge tax-breaks to companies that move to certain areas promising jobs that no one ever bothers to make sure are actually provided.  These funds could be better spent.<br />And isn't it important that the top one percent of wealthy people in the U.S. could end poverty and still live like emperors?  Need I be selfish and hypocritical and out-of-line to mention this fact.  I don't think so.  I cannot myself reach into my pocket and end poverty.  I would if I could.  By all means, let's have lots of private charity and local assistance.  But let's think bigger than that too.mply giving fish instead of fishing skills.

US	43735353	R24QSC4QBE82M7	0553375407	350438534	Ishmael:A Novel	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A Great Book	Daniel Quinn has an idea. He sees homo sapiens as on the verge of self-destruction and traces the major behavioral patterns bringing this about back to what is commonly referred to as the agricultural revolution. According to Quinn, we long supposed our species to have originated when writing originated some five thousand years ago, and continue to suppose \\"humanity\\" to have begun when what Quinn calls \\"totalitarian farming\\" began some ten thousand years ago, and this despite our now knowing that our ancestors diverged from other primates millions of years ago and became what we call homo sapiens two hundred thousand years ago. We dismiss the vast majority of human history as \\"pre-history\\" which is tantamount to \\"non-history.\\" We do not ask much about how humans lived before the agricultural revolution, and when we do we almost always suppose that such poor creatures would have leaped at the chance to be like us. (Quinn's argument seems to me valuable whether or not we are as close to disaster as he believes. Heidegger traced similar behaviors back to Greece. Others trace them to the Industrial Revolution. Quinn places the Break at the Agricultural Revolution.)<br />\\"When the people of your culture encountered the hunter-gatherers of Africa and America, it was thought that these were people who had DEGENERATED from the natural, agricultural state, people who had LOST the arts they'd been born with. The Takers had no idea that they were looking at what they themselves had been before they became agriculturalists. As far as the Takers knew, there WAS no 'before.' Creation had occurred just a few thousand years ago, and Man the Agriculturalist had immediately set about the task of building civilization.\\" (\\"Ishmael\\" p.201)<br />Quinn believes that tribes surrounding the first totalitarian farmers did their best to resist the new way of life, just as \\"primitive\\" tribes today try to resist the culture which I cannot call Western since Quinn lumps the East and West together as \\"Takers.\\" Totalitarian farming, civilized human culture East and West for the past ten thousand years: this is Taker culture. The vast majority of human history/\\"prehistory\\" and various tribes scattered through the world today Quinn calls Leavers. Leavers can be hunters, gatherers, herders, even farmers on a small scale. Quinn points to organized hunting as a uniquely human characteristic uniting us with our distant ancestors. What Leavers do not do is produce more than they need, rapidly expand their population, impose their way on others, annihilate species that threaten crops, and otherwise engage in \\"totalitarian farming.\\"<br />Leavers also do not work nearly as much as Takers. Quinn reads the story of Eden as an ancient Leaver Semitic myth about non-Semitic Takers, a myth handed down to uncomprehending Taker Jews and to uncomprehending Taker people like us. The forbidden wisdom was the arrogance of deciding what animals should live or die. Similarly Cain was the Takers killing the Leavers (Abel), although God preferred Abel's gift. Whether Quinn is right about the authors of these stories is a rather minor point, though one liable to draw a lot of attention. More important is this: Quinn sees virtually all the troubles of what we ordinarily call human history as the results of overcrowding. He doesn't think overcrowding is new. He thinks it has just gotten exponentially worse, and - like the frog in the slowly heating water - we are close to letting ourselves be boiled. Quinn blames war, crime, slavery, insanity, poverty, laborious work, suicide, drug addiction and quite a few other things on over-crowding and on the outlook that has caused the overcrowding. There are areas where I have serious doubts about Quinn's claims, places where I find him wrong or overly speculative. I intend to discuss some of these. But I want to stress first that I think Quinn should be read.<br />Of course, he IS being read. His books are best-sellers, prominently displayed inthe windows of the decreasing number of massive book store chains. But he is not read enough or seriously enough. His books are deceptively easy to flip through in a couple of hours, and they are (horror of horrors) not even simple treatises but NOVELS. In addition, Quinn seems bent on encouraging those who might be tempted to see him as a bit New-Agey, fruitcakey, self-enraptured, with hopes of leading a highly devoted cult. Quinn of course writes clearly and explicitly against such movements, but risks projecting that image all the same. Quinn cannot be accused of obscurantism, but I would be very much surprised if he is not (wrongly) accused of simplicity. And Quinn certainly projects the image of one who will never admit to being mistaken on any points. The Teachers in his books are characters who can accept praise but never correction, and who seem to accept assistance from their disciples only after they themselves have died.in the windows of the decreasing number of massive book store chains.

US	43735353	RIYQ8GHRY3HLH	0684857073	377398184	The NURTURE ASSUMPTION: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do	Books	4	14	18	N	N	Well done	This book appears to be very carefully put together.  It's not your usual genes vs. environment infotainment.  The author, and the author of her foreword, seriously overplay the outsider autodidactic myth.  Harris studied at a top graduate school, has co-written textbooks on psychology, thanks numerous colleagues in her Acknowledgments, and seems to know her material extremely well.<br /><br /> The book is persuasive, important, and entertaining.  I come away convinced of the importance of genes and of peer groups in shaping a person, but also certain that Harris sometimes overstates her case against the environmental importance of parents.<br /> The importance of Harris' evidence for peer group influence can be seen in the example she gives of a classroom in which the teacher (who thus has some influence of her own) gets the students to unite and identify as a single group self-characterized by strong academic performance.  These kids, unlike most kids given a Head Start, maintained that performance into adulthood.<br /> If dividing a class into good and poor readers causes the first group to improve and the latter to get worse, because the poor readers decide to look down on reading skills, then one can only wonder how much longer we will go on putting misbehaving kids together with others like them, watching them get even worse, and calling this destruction a \\"correctional institution.\\"<br /> I'd like to see every educator in the country read this book, but read it carefully.  Harris admits that parents have environmental effects, but either characterizes these as inessential or complains that they are unpredictable.  On p. 329 Harris says that parents may affect a person's choice of profession or leisure activities, but on p. 330 denies that they can have any impact on \\"what sort of person\\" a child becomes.  On p. 341 Harris makes the same point using the analogy of marriage:<br />\\"Marriage can change your opinions and influence your choice of a career or a religion.  But it doesn't change your personality, except in temporary, context-dependent ways.\\"<br /> What REALLY MATTERS, I'm guessing, is the sort of stuff asked about on personality inventories.  But does Harris believe that whether you are bold, shy, loving, trustful, humorous, or depressed is unconnected with such mere contexts as marriage, religion, career, and leisure activities - not to mention everything typically done with families rather than peers?  What interest should I take in a personality that exists somewhere outside such realms?<br /> Well, I'm not being entirely fair.  Harris' point that children may behave one way at home and another way with their friends is a good one.  And she herself points out that personality tests vary with context.  But, then, why dismiss personality changes as \\"temporary, context-dependent\\"?  Aren't all aspects of all personalities temporary and context-dependent?<br /> I cannot change my opinions without changing my personality, and I doubt that anyone can.  I resist playing different roles in different contexts (but recognize that this is problematic).  I've changed on my own and by reading books since I passed the age at which Harris thinks people are fixed for life.  And I've been changed by marriage.<br /> When Harris is not dismissing parental influence as inessential, she is complaining that it is not predictable.  The same parenting can have different effects on different kids.  Well, yes.  Parenting is an art, not a science.  Nowhere in her book does Harris mention the fact that lasting effects of peer influences are also unpredictable.<br /> Although Harris wants to maintain that certain aspects of a person are fixed by age 20 or 25, she also acknowledges that people change in significant ways after that time, not to mention before it.  Yes, parents only affect how kids behave with parents, but peers affect how kids behave with peers.  This can as easily be stated: Peers only affect how kids behave with that group of peers, but parents affect how they behave with their parents.  Harris has added an insight, but is intent on making it into a conflict and a fight to the death.<br /> I'm quibbling, as is my wont.  But I recognize my own life and those of others in Harris' descriptions of peer groups.  I have never accepted my own parents' view that their every move shaped my character.  I've always attributed more influence to genes and peers, just never quite to the complete exclusion of parenting.<br /> Parenting is, of course, important during the first couple of years, and in the ways that Harris acknowledges toward the end of her book.  It also may have some effects that are slow to appear.  When kids stop trying to be unlike adults (as Harris characterizes teenagerhood) they are likely to remember and observe anew how their parents behave.<br /> When I have kids I intend to recognize the genetic presence of human beings, not blank slates.  I intend to take into consideration the importance of peers and groups.  I intend not to worry too much about molding my kids, since I probably won't mold them much but may insult them by suggesting that I can.  And I plan to make their childhoods as happy as possible and to do what I can to influence them in ways I see as beneficial and likely to be successful, based, if not on any studies, on my best guess given the details involved and the extreme incapacity of social science to analyze them all.<br /> Indirect genetic effects (such as the love given to an especially attractive kid) are environmental, and everything environmental is filtered through genes.  Only in large studies can genes and environment be separated, not in individuals.<br /> Family environment is part of peer groups, and vice versa.  Young children may allow more of their family lives to enter their peer activities.  Teenagers may be teenagers because they have given more importance to their peer groups and allowed more of that world to enter their homes., but parents affect how they behave with their parents.

It's just a chronicling of facts, albeit with colorful metaphors sprinkled in.  So, it's not really a page-turner, but it is a fine work of reporting on a topic that is extremely hard to communicate.  Huffington does as good a job as anyone of describing the mammoth gap between the unimaginably large sums of money stolen by corporate crooks and the petty sorts of crimes that our law enforcement personnel love to prosecute.<br />Huffington names names, good and bad.  But she writes, rightly, that what's needed is a popular revolt, not a single knight in shining armor.  The one objection I have in this regard, is that she suggests writing your Congress Members to tell them not to pay attention to letter-writing campaigns, because they may have been solicited by lobbying firms.  Yes, it's good to be aware that lobbying firms are buying misleading ads that urge people to write to Congress on some issue.  But if people fall for such a ploy, they are still people.  In the end, urging Congress to pay more attention to letters (and less to dollars) will have a democratic result.  Huffington should be telling people to write, fax, Email, phone, and visit.	2003-03-09

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Useful Contribution	This is a good contribution to a usually muddled discussion.  I think that even people, like myself, who disagree with most of Wilson's attitudes toward criminal justice should agree with most of what he says here.<br />  Wilson favors a vocabulary of religion and traditional philosophy and displays a certain longing for English Victorian traditions.  He has nothing to say, though the opportunity couldn't offer itself more starkly, of attempts that might be made, and made  at less financial and human expense, to prevent crimes from occurring through non-punitive means like education, the<br />elimination of poverty, help for drug and alcohol  abusers, attempts at reconciliation of disputes, banning handguns, improving pop-culture, etc. Wilson is not disturbed by America's extreme rate of incarceration, and slants his figures to minimize it.  (For example, on p. 4 he says that Americans' belief that our courts are \\"more likely\\" than other nations' to excuse an offender and to moderate a penalty is \\"right\\" because an offender's chances of going to prison are \\"about the same\\" as in four other countries.)  Wilson suggests that we may imprison so much because our crime rate is so high, and that our crime rates (in certain ways) may be so low because we imprison so much.  Obviously an opposite case could be made with exactly equal plausibility: our crime rate is high despite or because of our culture of incarceration, and we incarcerate despite low crime rates (and because of factors like political cowardice and financial profit for prison companies).<br />  Wilson favors the best science in court rooms, but takes for granted certain powers of deterrence for which there isn't any evidence of that quality. Wilson also speaks of \\"deterrence and retribution\\" without explaining the latter term at all.  Wilson seems (bottom of page 4) to think that it is good to imprison based on a past record, though on pp. 90-91 he cites a study<br />showing that juries vary their sentences radically based on records, on psychological testimony, and on the likeableness of a person - things which Wilson, rightly, I think, complains are largely irrelevant. (Though I don't expect to hear him questioning the use of juries.)<br />  Wilson also has relatively little to say about the horrors of our prisons as reported by many human rights groups.  He describes inhumane punishment as a thing of the past.  And he dwells little on the possibility that some acquittals that have been labeled cases of abuse-excuse may be jury nullification on the basis of disagreement with laws and/or punishments.  In two instances Wilson does show that he is aware of the prevalence of this sort of thing (pp. 77, 110).<br />  I am obviously coming at these matters from a different perspective than Wilson. But I agree with his main point and take it to be an important one. There is a difference between explaining the causes of a crime and dealing with that crime in a court of law.  An explanation is not necessarily an excuse, and vice versa.  I even think that Wilson is right in those cases<br />where some readers will, no doubt, call him sexist or racist.  I do not think that past abuse of a wife justifies a wife's killing a sleeping husband.  I think that treating a woman as helpless is precisely NOT feminism.  I would even combine Wilson's dismissal of the alcohol excuse with his dismissal of the female excuse and say that, yes, on occasion drunk women willfully have<br />sex (though, of course, a drunk woman can also be raped).<br />  That said, I think that Wilson could make his case a little better.  The abuse-excuse is part and parcel of the same way of thinking that convicts criminals in America, a way of thinking from which Wilson does not attempt to escape.  This thinking might be called anti-consequentialism.  It is sentimental and backward-looking.  It may lean toward vengeance or sympathy, but it does not aim at reducing crime and crime's damage in the future.  It<br />does not take seriously goals of restitution, reconciliation, rehabilitation, protection, or even deterrence (which needs to be studied and at least guessed at, not just assumed).  Wilson approves of some moderate degree of sympathy and vengeance, but not of what he sees as their extremes.  This is different from treating them as irrelevant in a court of law and productive both of the excuses that bother Wilson and of the \\"Victims' Rights Movement\\" and its lynching speeches which bother some other people.<br />  Wilson recognizes the conflict that most people believe exists between responsibility and determinism.  He professes (and I've never seen an even remotely convincing argument for anything else) a belief that everything is caused.  He then points out that if we excuse whatever is caused we will excuse everything.  This, he says, is absurd, and therefore we shouldn't do<br />it.  I agree with the conclusion, but am not sure the argument will convince everyone.  For Wilson, anything that requires radical change is, for that reason, wrong.  On pp. 60 and 100 he dismisses certain conclusions because to accept them would require rewriting a lot of laws and court decisions.  Well, so what?  Is that a good enough argument for people more open than Wilson is to change?<br />  I think there is an argument for Wilson's position that will be more persuasive to people who, for example, would like to see our incarceration rate drastically cut.  Wilson analyzes the problem well.  He points out that juries often long for an explanation of how something came about.  But he does not do enough to prove his point that such longings should, in many cases, be irrelevant.  Wilson suggests admirable rewordings of legal distinctions.  And he makes a strong case for holding people responsible for their delusions and misconceptions.  But he doesn't make a clear enough case.<br />  Wilson bases this last stance on the standard of what a \\"reasonable person\\" would do, rather than a \\"subjective\\" judgment.

Bush	Books	4	21	30	N	N	This Will Endure	This book is a warning not to elect George W. and of course it's too late, he's already been appointed.  But it will remain useful far into the future to be able to read such an accurate prediction of what sort of president this clown was going to be.  Just as people in the future will be curious to examine what exactly our knowledge of global warming was while we went about creating it, some will be curious to read what knowledge we had of this walking catastrophe before we nearly elected him.<br />With this book we stand convicted of the most wide-eyed and aware political masochism.  Every nasty trait exhibited by Shrub since he planted himself in the White House had already been analyzed by Ivins and Dubose.  Each revelation that there was no compassion in the promoter of &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; had been foreseen.  The psychopathic inability to feel doubt, regret, humility, or concern had been documented, chronicled, and lamented before Georgie had left Texas.<br />Never forget it.	2003-03-03

(Of course the policies it advocates have not been adopted by the Bush II regime.)<br />People like me who would like to see our military drastically reduced and who have little faith in the good intentions of anyone involved in it are likely to be turned off by Greider's more middle of the road views and what appears to be his reluctance to express some of the anti-military views he does hold.<br />People who long for an ever bigger military are unlikely to be converted by this book.<br />I think Greider wanted to avoid preaching to a choir, but walking down the middle, or pretending to, has found him fewer readers than his information and ideas deserve.  He ought to have passionately argued a case (a moral case, not a strategic or economic one) for radical change.  Those inclined to agree would have been more likely to get their hands on the book, and those inclined to disagree would have ended up picking it up too in order to know their opponent.  Some would have been persuaded.<br />On page 10, Greider predicts a decrease in military (\\"defense\\") spending because this is what the public wants.  On page 172 Greider points out a yawning chasm between what the public wants and what happens. This is illustrative of a gradual shift.  The book starts out sounding like an article in the Washington Post and concludes sounding like one in the Nation.<br />The corruption analyzed along the way is not terribly new to readers of the Nation, but it's useful to have these facts and anecdotes in one place.  The fact that a single aircraft carrier costs $5 billion, the same price as a proposed National Housing Trust Fund, is the sort of thing that cannot be restated enough.<br />What we could have used much more than this book was a plan for tying opposition to military waste into campaigns for positive public spending.  We have for too long desperately needed to transform tax-and-spend proposals into axe-the-military-and-spend proposals.<br />We NEED to work out the politics of proposing and fighting a grassroots campaign for specific public school or Medicaid improvements tied to specific eliminations of military pork.<br />And quit calling it \\"defense\\" for godsake!d proposals into axe-the-military-and-spend proposals.<br />We NEED to work out the politics of proposing and fighting a grassroots campaign for specific public school or Medicaid improvements tied to specific eliminations of military pork.<br />And quit calling it \\"defense\\" for godsake!	2003-02-03

But the body of the book consists largely of Simonetta rejecting religion. Ten or 15 tiny pages toward the end explain what the seven words are that can change the world.<br />This book takes about 20 minutes to read, but I never would have read it had the author not suggested it to me. As an atheist and a snob, I would have rejected it on the basis of the title alone. As it turns out, I pretty much agree with Simonetta's main concerns (which include environmental destruction, unequal distribution of wealth, and corruption of democracy by money). And this book rejects religious foolishness as clearly as many that don't come packaged as a new understanding of sacredness devised by a student of divinity.<br />But the book is indeed simplistic. It doesn't seem likely to appeal to scholars already pressed for time. It doesn't tell me much I didn't already know. However, I might be tempted to buy 100 copies and send them to libraries. Not only is the book's message important, but its simplicity is a part of that message. Moral codes, which have largely been religious codes, have - like other law codes -- always simplified, and Simonetta is aiming here for the most general framework, a new 10 Commandments, an updated Golden Rule. I imagine if Thomas of Aquinas were around today, he might write something of this sort, dropping most of the nonsense current in his day but keeping the careful simplicity.<br />Simonetta's new code in seven words is: \\"Be healthy. Be kind. Respect the environment.\\" He presents this as a series of three relationships: to oneself, others, and the environment. After rejecting all previous pretensions to universal truth and disparaging our practice of clinging to old beliefs because we have called them sacred, Simonetta proceeds to call his seven words universal truth and sacred. This suggests to me that he has failed to see the radicalness in their day of various old and now foolish belief systems. Those who developed monotheism, for example, thought they were breaking with all past superstition as radically as Simonetta thinks he is. Of course, now we can lump monotheism with every other sort of theism and nontheistic religion and reject much of what is common to the lot. But declaring our truth universal and sacred suggests we haven't learned our lesson. Simonetta writes about his three rules:<br />\\"[T]his is not a human construct. This is simply the way life works. This is not contrived or fictional. This is not arbitrary or subject to dismissal. Nor is this in any way negotiable.\\"<br />Now, I know that Simonetta is too big a fan of democracy to completely mean to put forth such an edict against negotiation. He intends, in fact, to be generous and inclusive. He sees his code as so general and well-intended that it will not hurt anyone. In fact, he doesn't even think it will have to be imposed on anyone for their own good. He supposes that every reader will immediately recognize its truth. But will they?<br />Some will certainly object that Simonetta's three rules are not separable, that you can't have one without the other two. And he may not see that as a criticism. But some may go on to question more pointedly the distinction between others and the environment. Are the others other humans or other mammals or other life forms or other discreet objects? Is there anthropocentrism here? Do we need to be kind to humans but respectful of cows, and do we respect cows best by eating them? Would it not be better to respect humans and be kind to cows?<br />Some may, for different reasons, also question the appropriateness of kindness as a framework for all interactions with humans. Should one be kind to family, friends, compatriots, competitors, and enemies? Is there not a place for respectful competition and even meanness? Simonetta claims that only his way can allow the species to survive; social Darwinians might beg to differ. And then, why put the species on the same level as the environment? Isn't it most important to not destroy the planet as a whole? And why put the self on the same level as either? What if you can best help others through sacrifices that do not allow you the most healthy lifestyle? And isn't kindness an attitude we adopt toward individuals; how does this relate to the benevolence we bestow on society as a whole, sometimes at some individuals' expense?<br />I am playing devil's advocate to make the point that the seven words are not universal or permanent, not to suggest that I oppose them. While 10 years from now I might reject them as folly, right now I recommend them as critical to improving human society and preserving ecosystems. Even the consequentialism implicit in the seven words and explicit in the book (the recognition that what we do has consequences and that those consequences must be the measure of our ethics) is worthy of the highest recommendation in an age in which we are altering the planet's weather while our university philosophy departments are keeping busy debating the relative merits of consequentialism and deontology.<br />Of course, accepting the value of the seven words still leaves a huge need for specifics. Simonetta tries to sneak a few in himself with a section immediately following his introduction of the seven words entitled \\"The Law of One.\\" This section seems intended to make the seven words sound more mystical.triots, competitors, and enemies?

Packed with examples of how movements have succeeded and failed, this extremely readable handbook will inspire through its analysis of strategies and tactics that can be used to accomplish what many of us desperately want. Most of us understand already that simply arguing for social justice will fail to achieve it, but -- as Shaw demonstrates -- Herculean efforts, if miscalculated, will just as surely fail. In this book, Shaw describes successful strategies for community organizers, effective relationships with elected officials, the use of coalitions, ballot initiatives, the media, lawyers, and direct action strategies. The most persuasive theme tying each of these discussions together is that the best defense is an effective offense, that a failure to aggressively pursue positive change is a strategy for worsening the status quo.	2002-12-29

It's a different size and shape, the pages are thick, the thing feels significantly heavier than it looks, and it's waterproof.<br />The design of the book is making a point also made in the text of the book: the current state of recycling generally turns higher quality products into lower quality ones useful only for purposes other than the original product, and then eventually discards them.  This is not recycling; it's slow motion waste.<br />&quot;Cradle to Cradle,&quot; the object, is intended to be easily and completely recyclable into a new book of the same quality.<br />&quot;Cradle to cradle,&quot; the phrase, is contrasted to &quot;cradle to grave.&quot;<br />&quot;Cradle to Cradle,&quot; the text, argues in favor of making all human productions either recyclable in the way this book is or completely biodegradable so that they can be used as fertilizer.<br />In the future envisioned and partially created and described by this pair of authors, packaging will be tossed on the ground in response to signs reading &quot;Please litter!&quot;  Appliances will be leased and returned to manufacturers to be completely recycled.  Objects that must contain both biodegradable and inorganic recyclable elements will be easily separable into those respective parts: you'll toss the soles of your shoes into the garden and give the uppers back to the shoemaker.  And the water coming out of factories will be cleaner than what came in, motivating the factory owners to reuse it and eliminating the need for the government to test its toxicity.<br />These authors teemed up on the 1991 Hannover Principles to guide the design of the 2000 World's Fair.  McDonough has an architecture firm in Charlottesville, Va., and from 1994 to 1999 was dean of the University of Virginia's School of Architecture.  Braungart is a German chemist who for several years headed the chemistry section of Greenpeace.<br />This book is superb and should be read by those familiar with the issues of environmental design and those completely new to the topic.  It draws on themes common in a long list of books ranging from &quot;Ishmael,&quot; by Daniel Quinn to &quot;Natural Capitalism,&quot; by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins.  But McDonough and Braungart make no acknowledgements of any such influences and present themselves (just as these other authors have) as the vanguard of a change as radical as the industrial revolution.<br />Their idea is incredibly important and well stated, but it's not the clear break from current environmental (or for that matter industrial or &quot;Third Way&quot;) thinking that they maintain - and for students of evolution why should it need to be, what's wrong with evolving our thinking a helpful bit further, as they have done?  What McD and B propose as revolutionary is -- instead of reducing pollution and consumption and having fewer children -- making increased economic activity actually beneficial to the planet.<br />Three comments.  First, this book does not suggest any radical change in behavior for the typical reader.  (Have lots of kids, drive lots of cars, buy lots of stuff - what a break through!)  This book is, rather, advice for architects, corporations, and municipalities.  It is intended to free the typical reader of guilt.  I think it should do something else as well, namely urge us to political action, to demanding of our democratically elected representatives that the earth-saving innovations described in the book be taken advantage of.  All the descriptions in this book of common household objects, such as sofas, &quot;off-gasing&quot; toxic particles makes me want to take action to change things or at least buy a mask, not go shopping.<br />Second, the examples of new materials and building and product designs described in the book all build on the environmental thinking that McD and B so loudly reject.  Reducing pollution to zero is not a &quot;new paradigm&quot; from reducing pollution to a teeny bit - it's just better.<br />Third, the vision of rendering mad self-indulgence completely beneficial to all other species is far from a reality, and even the dream described by McD and B would not, in any way that I can imagine, make it possible to place an unlimited number of humans on the planet without hurting anything - more humans than under current practices, yes -- an infinite number, no.  But let's remember that most of the people now on the planet do not do nearly as much damage as we do in this country.  How many billion Americans the Earth can hold has not been answered.<br />There is also a disturbing thread of anti-government corporatism in the book.  Ford and Nike and other corporations for which the authors have worked are described as heroes for their positive efforts, while their destructive practices are passed over.  The authors repeat a distinction (citing Jane Jacobs' &quot;Systems of Survival&quot;) between Guardians and Commerce, i.e. paternalistic government and noble corporate heroes:<br />&quot;Commerce is quick, highly creative, inventive, constantly seeking short- and long-term advantage, and inherently honest: you can't do business with people if they aren't trustworthy.&quot;<br />Is this a joke?  Do these guys believe press releases they read from, say, Enron?  (Apparently so, because later in the book they write: &quot;...the summer of 2001, when unusually high energy demand in California led to rolling blackouts, skyrocketing prices, even accusations of profiteering....&quot;  Accusations!  High demand or restrained supply?  What rock have these intelligent authors been naturally cooling themselves under?  Well, at least they recognize the concept of profiteering, even though it fits poorly with the inherent honesty of commerce.)<br />Immediately following the &quot;inherently honest&quot; comment (page 60) Mc D and B go on to equate regulation with partial pollution reduction, and to conclude that because complete pollution reduction is desirable and possible, regulation is bad.  Instead they should conclude that rather than allowing limited pollution, regulators should ban it entirely (through whatever stages of phasing in that policy prove feasible).igm&quot; from reducing pollution to a teeny bit - it's just better.  <br />Third, the vision of rendering mad self-indulgence completely beneficial to all other species is far from a reality, and even the dream described by McD and B would not, in any way that I can imagine, make it possible to place an unlimited number of humans on the planet without hurting anything - more humans than under current practices, yes -- an infinite number, no.

One is increased reliance on individual rights and legal protections.  Federal laws ban all sorts of discrimination, endangerment, and abuse, but the federal government does not do an effective job of protecting workers from retaliation for asserting their rights and almost nothing to maintain other important elements of the workplace, such as wage levels or the prevention of mass layoffs.<br />We have learned to think of ourselves as individuals protected by laws, rather than brotherhoods and sisterhoods protected by our strength in numbers.  We have a long list of rights, including - most notoriously - the \\"right to work.\\"  So called Right to Work laws clearly hurt unions but are not too far afield from modes of thought that labor supporters have engaged in themselves.<br />Unions are now seen as ways to protect individual jobs and proper grievance procedures following individual wrongs, not as cross-company efforts to lift the wages and benefits of entire industries.  If the purpose of a union is simply to protect me from specific injustices, surely I ought also to respect my coworker's right to not be coerced to join, right?<br />But if the purpose of a union is to change society and improve the lot of all workers, then clearly the \\"right\\" of my coworker to be a freeloader and drag us all down is not to be respected.<br />The case Lichtenstein makes is that in the process of making fantastic gains in the Civil Rights, Feminist, and other movements, leftists unwittingly sacrificed a conception of the labor union that is badly needed today.  No doubt, this analysis will annoy some people, but it ought to be taken as encouraging.  The right didn't defeat us; we beat ourselves.  Therefore, a reconstituted labor left can successfully fight back.we beat ourselves.  Therefore, a reconstituted labor left can successfully fight back.	2002-04-04

To begin with, it's mistitled.  The book is a proposal for Theme-Based Academies in public schools, in which teams of teachers design curricula around themes that keep the students interested in learning.  Vouchers and the rest are used as a threat to justify the need for this change if we are to save the &quot;marketability&quot; of our public schools.  Otherwise, the concepts in the book's title aren't addressed at much length, and the description of the book on its back cover is absurdly misleading.<br />The book starts out with a couple of other strikes against it.  It promotes patriotism on the front cover and religion on the back (neither of which I care for, though I'm aware many others do).  The book is full of bad grammar, typos, and arrogant grand pronouncements, and it starts out in a rambling stream-of-consciousness manner that barely managed to hold my interest.<br />Getting through it was worth the effort, because the book's proposal makes a lot of sense.  Thirty percent of American kids drop out of high school, and it's hard to blame them.  The education provided is often lousy and does not even seem well-intentioned.  It bears little relationship either to what students expect to be doing after graduation or what they would prefer to be doing right now.<br />Breidner makes some proposals that would probably help, and are already helping in some places:<br />Theme-based education (themes include: &quot;liberal arts, small business, financial/banking, law, aviation, bio-medical, advertising, television, woodworking, art/design, maritime, wildlife/ecology, and the like.&quot;); Teacher teams with a Lead Teacher for each academy, and team control over what other teachers joins the team; Teacher control over lesson plans; Apprenticeship programs; Higher teacher pay; Higher teacher qualifications; Renaming principals &quot;administrators,&quot; separating their duties from those of teachers, and paying them less than teachers; School choice for parents; Requiring student attendance and parent participation; Requiring that parents be financially responsible for students' behavior; Reviewing students' progress on the basis of a portfolio of work.<br />These excellent proposals are explained in a disorganized but persuasive manner, and at only 89 pages the book's drawbacks don't amount to much trouble.  I think it should be read by anyone thinking about the problems with our schools.Higher teacher qualifications; Renaming principals &quot;administrators,&quot; separating their duties from those of teachers, and paying them less than teachers; School choice for parents; Requiring student attendance and parent participation; Requiring that parents be financially responsible for students' behavior; Reviewing students' progress on the basis of a portfolio of work.<br />These excellent proposals are explained in a disorganized but persuasive manner, and at only 89 pages the book's drawbacks don't amount to much trouble.

(New Democracy Forum)	Books	5	10	13	N	Y	Badly needed	&quot;What's Wrong With a Free Lunch&quot; by Philippe Van Parijs proposes that every person be given an above-subsistence-level Universal Basic Income with no strings attached.  The book includes responses from 15 thinkers, mostly sympathetic to the idea.  A couple oppose the idea of letting anyone have anything for nothing (as if that were not already the case), and several suggest what they see as similar but better ideas.  The majority of these are based on the idea that enacting a UBI in the United States is unlikely, not that it is undesirable.<br />This may be right, but even an unreasonable goal serves a very important purpose.  Many of the right-wing ideas openly discussed in the media are, I dearly hope, unreasonable goals.  But they serve the purpose of making somewhat-less-destructive ideas pass for &quot;centrist.&quot;  As long as the right wing proposes what it dreams of and the left wing proposes only what it thinks it can get in the foreseeable future, the &quot;center&quot; will be commonly placed further and further from what the left thought it could get.  Van Parijis's book is exactly the sort of thing needed to break this defeatist pattern.  We need to direct our energies to the achievable, yes, but we also have to dream -- or the achievable won't be.<br />I'm not convinced that some of the alternatives offered, such as a Negative Income Tax, are either more desirable or more feasible.  And concentrating on how best to convince Americans to pay more income taxes is the wrong thing to be worried about.<br />Our first project should be to free up the tax dollars we are wasting.  We should cut military spending, cut prison spending, cancel the wars on victimless crimes, cut highway spending, cut trash-removal spending, eliminate corporate welfare, tax pollution, tax the use of natural resources, tax corporations, tax the extremely rich, tax wealth, tax union busting, tax estates, eliminate the cap on payroll taxes, eliminate offshore banking, etc., etc.  The idea that we need to devise a means of doing good that will most readily persuade a large segment of society to pay higher income taxes is hopelessly misguided.  (And the idea that people won't want others to have free money while they &quot;have to work for it&quot; misses the whole point of the UBI: everybody gets it!)<br />What I find most attractive about a UBI is the hope that it would eliminate the most unattractive and lowest paying jobs.

October 2000<br />&quot;METROPOLITICS: A regional agenda for community and stability&quot;  (1997) by Myron Orfield presents a convincing solution to a surprising array of problems.  Americans hate sprawl, but they hate even more anything that they can find a way to label socialism.  Orfield describes a system of regional government -- tried and tested by himself and others in Minnesota -- that promoters of corporate profit will have a difficult time pinning the pinko label on.  Much of what Orfield thinks promotes sprawl are government regulations and projects of an undesirable sort.<br />Regional planning reduces competition among towns, counties, and neighborhoods that hurts them all.  Without regionalism, taxpayers end up subsidizing sprawl and ghettoization.  Companies play one locality off against another to find the biggest giveaways.  Developers lobby successfully for publicly funded infrastructure in the hinterlands, and affluent (largely white) residents move out of downtown.  Schools in the city become dominated by poor students, taxes are raised to subsidize the wealthy suburbs, and white flight escalates.<br />Orfield's book concentrates on the example of Minneapolis/St. Paul, but is applicable around the United States, and presents useful strategies for improving schools, creating affordable housing, and numerous other projects in addition to protecting the environment and quality of life.  Orfield maintains that higher spending on schools in areas of concentrated poverty is pointless.  What's needed, he says, is (aside from the elimination of poverty, and as a step in that direction) a redistribution moving some of the poor to the suburbs and some of the wealthy downtown.  He wants to fight sprawl, in fact, by building affordable housing in the suburbs.  This is because he sees a primary promoter of sprawl as ghettoization and white flight.<br />Of course, Orfield also wants to see denser construction, and argues that competition among localities drives the desire for less dense construction in hopes that it will produce more tax revenue than it produces demand for services.  Regional planning can avoid this vicious rivalry, and -- by mixing housing of various prices -- can allow people to live nearer their jobs, thus cutting the costs of transportation throughout the region.<br />I think Orfield's point about schools is worth quoting a few passages.  I, for one, am immediately suspicious of any assertion that what struggling schools need is not money.  But this one I find persuasive:<br />&quot;Schools are the first victim and most powerful perpetuator of metropolitan polarization.&quot;<br />&quot;Few people realize that the central-city schools spend $7,060 per pupil. 15 percent more than any other group of districts in the Twin Cities.  Spending on central-city schools is also high in Chicago, Atlanta, and many other cities throughout the United States.  No matter where it occurs, higher spending does little to attract or retain middle-class students.  The existing level of poverty and student diversity are overriding deflectors.&quot;<br />&quot;'If you just fix the schools so the middle class will be comfortable, the city will stabilize,' reform advocates often say.  This claim would be true if anyone knew how to fix monolithically poor schools.  School reformers, like reform advocates for cities, rarely take into account the effects of concentrated poverty on schools -- effects that are fundamental to how attractive these schools appear to the middle class.&quot;es the desire for less dense construction in hopes that it will produce more tax revenue than it produces demand for services.

As he says of debates on the matters he discusses, &quot;I suspect that all either side can do is to restate its case over and over again, in context  after context.&quot;  This he has done, and done well, and it's badly  needed.<br />But, as far as I can tell, it remains flawed.  No, I don't want  to accuse Rorty of some shameful circularity, much less of the inanely  conceived offense of &quot;relativism.&quot;  Rather, I believe that in  misdecribing the relationship between philosophy and politics he  understates the importance of what he is doing and provides readers wrongly  with every reason to ignore it.<br />&quot;Most of what I have written in the  last decade consists of attempts to tie in my social hopes - hopes for a  global, cosmopolitan, democratic, egalitarian, classless, casteless society  - with my antagonism towards Platonism.&quot;  Thus does Rorty begin the  Preface to this book, though like all of his books this one devotes much  effort to minimizing any possible connection between Rorty's two fields of  interest.  By the time we get to page 18, he denounces &quot;the idea that  you can evaluate a writer's philosophical views by reference to their  political utility.&quot;<br />This comes after he has criticized the  philosophy he opposes as wasting human energy that could serve better  purposes, and after he has defined truth in pragmatist terms as what it is  useful to believe.<br />Rorty is correct, of course, that a Platonist or a  pragmatist can be a democrat or a facsist.  But, when he says on page 18  that he finds &quot;the orthodox&quot; to be &quot;philosophically wrong as  well as politically dangerous,&quot; I think he is mistaken if he believes  this to be a coincidence.  He is wrong to separate these two  characteristics in the case of many Americans today.  I think he does so  simply because the two things have appeared separately in other  people.<br />Call it &quot;contingent&quot; or &quot;historical&quot; or any  other number of bad words, but I think it remains the case that much of  what is ugliest in American politics is connected in the minds of its  proponents with much of what is most metaphysical and morally weak in the  world today.  People fail to look beyond their narrow groups, declare  certain sexual habits improper, decree that &quot;the market&quot; not be  interfered with or that the races not mingle, and that dollars constitute  protected speech - and they do so, many of them, metaphysically.  Homosexuality, they say, is evil because God said so.  Of course the two  can be separated.  Atheists can condemn homosexuality and Platonists can -  like many of the characters of the Dialogues - accept it.  But the two  ideas go together in many minds right now, and removing either one weakens  the other.  If you turn a Christian gaybasher into a pragmatist, you make  him less likely to bash gays (and to accept the valuable teachings of  Christianity as opposed to its theism).  If you turn a Christian gaybasher  into an acceptor of gays, you make him more able to question his theism.

Not only that, but they suggest, as  opponents of postmodernism or pragmatism do, that outgrowing the tiresome  remnants of religion found in the arrogant self-descriptions of scientists  or ethicists actually allows (or is it causes?) &quot;the return of  religion&quot; - an event which they claim to be witnessing although they  offer little argument for its existence or desirability.  They seem (and,  of course, each takes a slightly different tack) to be arguing ad populum  instead of admitting their desire for religion.  They explain that people  are scared by nuclear proliferation and environmental destruction and are  turning to religion, but do not address whether such false comfort should  be joined in.  Rather, they simply join in it - without, however, ever  quite saying so.  Not one of them writes &quot;I believe in God,&quot; but  each asserts by every word he writes &quot;God is worth writing  about.&quot;	2000-01-23

It makes me want to read and reread a great many books, examine and re-examine a great number of sculptures and paintings.  There are in it interpretations  of particular works with which I disagree, and others on which I am not  qualified to judge, but the big themes in it - the continuity of paganism,  the approaches to sex and nature - are a valuable contribution.  One  of the more valuable ideas I got out of this book was the notion of nature  as the unpredictable or uncontrollable.  Understanding nature in this way  does-in the usual distinction between nature and nurture, one of our more  annoying never-to-be-answered &quot;disputes.&quot;  The cultural can be  thought of as what I can predict, control, know.  The natural is, then, not  just storms, weather, meteors but also to various degrees Kafkan  bureaucracies, friends and relatives, social trends, my future self.  How  some combination of genes, nutrition, parenting, television, choices of  career and friends, and so on, will have created the person I will be in  ten more years is not an illegitimate question.  But its possible answers  do not divide usefully into two categories (or three, if we [attempt  unsuccessfully to] add to &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;nurture&quot; the  category of &quot;free will&quot;), and its answer can never be complete.  It is a compelling line of thought for another reason, namely that it  touches - however clumsily - on the question of what we can control and  what we cannot.<br />Paglia is a subtle and intelligent writer, and hasty  simplifications of her positions are liable to be wrong.  For example, she  deplores avoidance of concentration on biographical information about a  work's author, but she also frequently overrules an author's judgment of  his or her work.<br />Still, there is a position that seems pretty clearly  present in Paglia with which I'd like to quarrel.  At the very least it is  a position that Paglia can have expected her readers to find and that she  has not renounced.  The idea that I have in mind is that of nature as a  permanent force or set of forces resulting in specific events.  I'm  undecided as to how much, if at all, Paglia overstates some of her readings  of sexual themes in Western art.  But I am certain that she overstates her  belief in the immutability of female and male &quot;nature&quot; or  behavior.  I am certain that her interpretations do not conflict with but  add to various interpretations she believes she's disproven (though, others  I think she has indeed disproven).  And I have no doubt that she  underestimates the importance of cultural tradition in discouraging the  creation of more and greater female creators.<br />Paglia uses  &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; as categories of behaviors that any  person can - to some degree, at least - adopt, and yet she thinks of them  as pre-existing culture.  She will state one conclusion and then preface  her assertion of the opposite with the words &quot;Mythologically, however  ....&quot;  These points are usually good ones, but they describe a culture  that is changing, not a permanent realm of Myth.  Paglia thinks that lack  of freedom and opportunity has had little to do with preventing the arising  of more great women artists, but she does not comment on the importance of  artistic tradition to an artist and how it may have been and still be  difficult for women to jump into traditions dominated by men.  Bloom is an  influence on Paglia and influence is a theme of her book, yet she ignores  it here.  To her mind female artists have had to masculinize themselves not  in order to enter a masculine tradition but in order to enter any artistic  tradition that there might have been.<br />I am attracted to what Paglia sees  as the honesty of depicting violence and cruelty in human life, even in  childhood, because I largely agree with her.  But there is also a great  dealof gentleness and compassion which it is no less honest to depict  (and, importantly, thereby to encourage).  Countless readers are bound to  come away from Paglia thinking that she has proven that certain violent  sadistic tendencies are INEVITABLE and PERMANENT and (therefore) proper.  This is bunk, and I hold out hope that Paglia knows as much.  This kind of  thinking results in our greatest social hopes being for &quot;just  wars,&quot; not peace, for state executions that do not allow the victim's  face to reveal agony, rather than a ban on capital punishment, for the  play-acting of rape and murder rather than excitement over peace and love.  This is the thinking that produces cultural products that encourage  violence on the fallacious grounds that viewing violent movies will  &quot;get the violence out of kids' systems,&quot; rather than - as is  clearly the case - put the violence in kids' systems.  Paglia's SEXUAL  PERSONAE are in part what are usually called sex-objects, and thinking  about people as people or as sex-objects is a choice one can make.  I  suspect that Paglia disagrees with me about which way of thinking is more  important.<br />Like most great thinkers, Paglia overestimates her  accomplishment.  She has picked out a new strain in Western history.  She  has not shown us the true face of humanity.<br />What she has done, though,  is fantastic, and my main hope is that we do not UNDER-estimate her  accomplishment or relegate her to the department of lesbian studies or  &quot;cult status&quot; among witches, pagans, wiggans, etc.deal of gentleness and compassion which it is no less honest to depict  (and, importantly, thereby to encourage).

A fan of pragmatism may be turned off by the 2nd through the 6th essays, but of the following 25 at least 23 or 24 are well  worth reading.  The section on law debates the question of whether  philosophy influences or &quot;supports&quot; law.  I came away, as I'd  been before, convinced that moving to pragmatism in philosophy is likely to  have a good effect on legal opinions and that Rorty is absurdly unfair to  the value of his own work by stressing that law can get on without  traditional philosophy.  Of course it can, but what needs to be said is  that we would be better off if it did.  The concluding essay by Stanley  Fish is wonderful and makes a point I've been trying to find someone to  agree with for years, namely that religious tolerance is a contradiction in  terms; tolerance is a restriction on religion.	1999-02-11

McColgan does a great job on the history of rape and misogyny, but seems to expect the reader to infer that somehow the horrors of the thirteenth century, for  example, are still around today.  I was unable to make this inference in  the absence of any argument.<br /> McColgan also does a good job describing  current misogyny, including how laws treat women as property which can be  &quot;defiled,&quot; but presents this as an entire picture or image of  &quot;what date rape is about.&quot;  McColgan may well be a woman who can  take care of herself, who knows how to communicate clearly and can  distinguish when she has been victimized from when she has simply done  something that she regrets.  But for all of her speaking on behalf of  &quot;Woman&quot; and &quot;We Women&quot; McColgan remains one individual.<br /> This book is also somewhat useful for an idea of how laws and attitudes  differ in the U.S. and the UK.  An American reader familiar with studies of  false accusations and with American attitudes toward accused rapists can  conclude either that English attitudes are much more skeptical of accusers,  or that McColgan is way out of touch, or a little of each.<br /> McColgan's  book does a great job of depicting the travails of rape victims, but  provides no balance.  A concession on page 103 (in an 108-page book) to the  effect that some tiny number of false accusations do occur seems out of  place in a book dedicated to presenting the proper &quot;picture&quot; -  that in which women are good and men are bad.<br /> Trustworthy experience of  cases of rape accusations is necessarily limited.  Those arguing for the  lesser or greater frequency of false charges are at risk of pretending to  omniscience, and McColgan has succumbed to that risk.  She judges the  honesty of men by comparison with women's accounts, which she silently  assumes to be universally true (for example on p. 66).  An assumption of  innocence for the accused, a central concept in our justice systems,  clearly conflicts with an assumption of honesty in an accuser.  McColgan  opts entirely for the latter and does not comment on the former.  And in  all of her dismay over the alleged paucity of rape convictions she says not  one word about prisons or why she wants men put in them.<br /> McColgan  laments the failure of a court to convict a man of rape in an incident  which his drunken partner or victim could not remember.  McColgan would  take away a man's life on the basis of a guess.<br /> McColgan says that  women often do not scream because their &quot;shock and embarrassment act  as an effective gag.&quot;  Yet she assumes both that women are always able  to TALK, despite this gag, and communicate their wishes, and that women  never make accusations precisely because of their embarrassment.<br />  McColgan claims that rape is wildly under-reported, but does not address  the possibility that some fraction of unreported cases are cases that women  are lying about.  McColgan applauds the anonymous scribbling of rapist  lists on bathroom walls without the least proof or accountability.  This is  the Malcom X, not the MLK, approach to social change.  This is Woman  against Man.  Never mind whether every man destroyed in the process is  actually guilty of anything, or whether lies backfire by making other women  less believable.<br /> McColgan quotes, but utterly fails to understand, a  comment that very probably explains some false accusations.  Women are told  to be free and sexually &quot;healthy&quot; at the same time that they are  told to be &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;unsoiled.&quot;  This can lead to  internal conflict and regret.<br /> McColgan quotes a comment viewing both  rape and false accusation as horrible crimes and calls this view  &quot;pernicious.&quot;  I guess it not only suggests that false  accusations occur, but fails to take sides in the Men vs. Women war,  preferring to advocate justice.  How pernicious!<br /> McColgan distorts  other balanced views, such as Katie Roiphe's, so that she can easily oppose  them.  To hear McColgan tell it, Roiphe believes that forced sex by  acquaintances NEVER occurs.  McColgan cites English legal practices, in  which apparently rape shield laws are little followed, and then treats  descriptions of U.S. events as wrong-headed.<br /> McColgan also  oversimplifies the question of rapists' motivations, claiming that sex  plays no part.  This is as absurd as claiming that violence plays no part.<br /> This book is well worth reading.  Many women are horribly mistreated  by husbands, boyfriends, strangers, lawyers, judges, and the media.  But  this book is also worth taking with a grain of salt.  It is not written  about the complex real world in which members of oppressed groups often  oppress members of dominant groups.

She distinguishes secrecy from  privacy.  She distinguishes  good secrets from bad ones.  She defends the need  for privacy and secrets  in several convincing ways, including some surprising  ones such as the  need for surprise, but in an unconvincing way as well.  She  appeals to the  lessons of Orwell's 1984, claiming that the protagonist Winston  Smith was  persecuted for secrecy and threw his life away because he wanted  secrecy  that badly.  (In a footnote in another context Bok describes  confessions  thus: \\"The sin . . . may not always lie in what has been hidden,  but  rather in the hiding itself.\\") Is that right?  It seems to me, as I  remember Orwell's book, that Big Brother had the horrible defect of not  allowing free speech, which is not the same as not allowing secrecy.  Certainly Big Brother tried to prevent secrecy as well.  But did He do this  as  an end in itself?  If Smith could have openly dissented and loved he  would not  necessarily have wanted secrecy.  I think that what's needed is  some thought  on how surveillance relates to the offense not of \\"invasion\\"  but of distrust.<br />  Bok discusses self-deception as well as other  secrets.  She sees some  advantages in Freud's picture of multiple selves  with barriers between them,  as opposed to Sartre's terminology, \\"bad  faith,\\" in trying to explain how a  single person can keep a secret from  him/herself.  But Freud's picture, I  think, remains a Socratic one: a  person cannot \\"know him/herself.\\"  Sartre, on  the other hand, is trying to  avoid pinning responsibility on \\"another self.\\"  In Sartre's vocabulary,  there is no barrier to knowing oneself.  And why  shouldn't I know myself?  A plant has a past and a future, and we are usually  happy to say that we  can know a plant.  This does not imply that we cannot  learn more about the  plant.plant.	1999-01-15

Although you know before reading the book that the men were eventually  exonerated, the book grips you.<br /> It's a courageous, honest, and  intelligent story of prosecutorial corruption and defense lawyers' almost  superhuman incompetence.  Despite the paranoia that events like these  create in victims of injustice and the cynicism they foster in do-gooders,  this should be received as a hopeful book, proof that injustice is not  invincible.<br /> But hope should not become complacency.  As the authors  write:<br /> &quot;There's no way to know how many wrongful convictions  there are, but even if the error rate in the criminal justice system were  only one percent there'd be more than ten thousand cases in the  country.&quot;<br /> The police in this case had a standard procedure of  keeping two files, one of them secret.  The prosecutors had sophisticated  systems in place for stifling the truth.  These facts suggest an  &quot;error rate&quot; potentially higher than one percent.<br /> Citing a  book by Michael Radelet, the authors report that there have been 421  Americans this century convicted of capital crimes and later proved  innocent.  In 23 of these cases the proof came too late.<br /> In this  case, the police had good leads on the actual criminals.  These were kept  quiet because of political connections until the wrong men had been  publicly accused.  After they had accused four men, prosecutors did not  want to switch to accusing different ones just because the new ones looked  like they might really be guilty.  So the evidence was buried.<br /> As a  result, four families were ruined, and at least one of the actual criminals  committed at least one more murder, thus destroying more lives.  And, of  course, courts were tied up with endless hours of ridiculously pointless  work, while trust and relations between citizens and police was horribly  damaged.<br /> No police officers or prosecutors were charged with any  crimes in this matter.

Why it is for the most part Catholic schools  that are willing to teach any sort of innovative philosophy in the Anglo  world I'm not entirely sure.  Anyway, Derrida talks about justice,  comparing it with the giving of a gift.  Before quoting what he says, I'd  like to bear in mind a few maxims from La Rochefoucauld:<br /> &quot;A man's  ingratitude may be less reprehensible than the motives of his  benefactor.&quot;<br /> &quot;Over-eagerness to repay a debt is in itself a  kind of ingratitude.&quot;<br />  &quot;Almost everybody enjoys repaying  small obligations, many are grateful for middling ones, but there is  scarcely a soul who is not ungrateful for big ones.&quot;<br />Here's  Derrida:  &quot;The only thing I would say about the gift  - this is an  enormous problem - is that the gift is precisely, and this is what it has  in common with justice, something which cannot be reappropriated.  A gift  is something which never appears as such and is never equal to gratitude,  to commerce, to compensation, to reward.  When a gift is given, first of  all, no gratitude can be proportionate to it.  A gift is something that you  cannot be thankful for.  As soon as I say 'thank you' for a gift, I start  canceling the gift, I start destroying the gift, by proposing an  equivalence, that is, a circle which encircles the gift in a movement of  reappropriation.  So, a gift is something that is beyond the circle of  reappropriation, beyond the circle of gratitude.  A gift should not even be  acknowledged as such.  As soon as I know that I give something, if I say 'I  am giving you something,' I just canceled the gift.  I congratulate myself  or thank myself for giving something and then the circle has already  started to cancel the gift.  So, the gift should not be rewarded, should  not be reappropriated, and should not even appear as such.  As soon as the  gift appears as such then the movement of gratitude, of acknowledgment, has  started to destroy the gift, if there is such a thing - I am not sure, one  is never sure that there is a gift, that the gift is given.  If the gift is  given, then it should not even appear to the one who receives it, not  appear as such.  That is paradoxical, but that is the condition for a gift  to be given.  &quot;That is the condition the gift shares with justice.  A  justice that could appear as such, that could be calculated, a calculation  of what is just and what is not just, saying what has to be given in order  to be just - that is not justice.  That is social security, economics.  Justice and gift should go beyond calculation.  This does not mean that we  should not calculate.  We have to calculate as rigorously as possible.  But  there is a point or limit beyond which calculation must fail, and we must  recognize that.&quot;<br /> To the extent that Derrida is not just being  mystical, he seems to me to be talking about kindness, and would be better  off using that word, even if Plato did not.  Derrida takes La  Rochefoucauld's ideas to an extreme, which is strange.  La Rochefoucauld  was convinced that there was no kindness in the world.  He spoke of justice  as a disguised expression of &quot;self-interest,&quot; just as political  theorists referred to it as a contract.  Derrida seeks to promote more  kindness in the world, well aware of its existence, by accepting La  Rochefoucauld's assertion that it does not exist.appropriated, and should not even appear as such.

The book is also about the struggle required  in order to write such a book, a struggle that has recently been made much  harder.  Compare the following quotes.<br />(1)&quot;There are countries  in which public establishments are considered by the government as its own  personal affair, so that it admits persons to them only according to its  pleasure, just as a proprietor refuses at his pleasure admission into his  house; they are a sort of administrative sanctuaries, into which no profane  person can penetrate.  These establishments, on the contrary, in the United  States, are considered as belonging to all.  The prisons are open to  everyone who chooses to inspect them ad every visiter may inform himself of  the order which regulates the interior.&quot; - Gustave de Beaumont and  Alexis de Tocqueville, 1833<br />(2)&quot;The United States Supreme  Court, in a series of decisions going back to the 1970s, had helped to  ensure that the nation's prisons stayed isolated and unknown, that  criminals, once sent away, could be forgotten. . . .<br />&quot; . . . A  recent federal law, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, driven through  Congress to ensure that incarceration not be too costly to the taxpayers or  too joyful for the convicts, will likely free Angola from federal oversight  within the coming months.&quot; - Daniel Bergner, 1998<br />  Bergner  handles, by his own account, many difficult situations with wisdom and  grace.  He proves his points and labels his speculations as such.  He is  neither cynical nor gullible.  My one complaint is that he includes a  passage toward the end (Chapter 15) in which he simultaneously preaches  vengeance and quotes Jesus, apparently oblivious to the irony.  Proclaiming  any moral feat (in this case love of an enemy) impossible is always a moral  disgrace.  However great the majority of Americans who are unable to  overcome the thirst for vengeance that Bergner attributes to all people,  there is a minority being ignored, erased from the &quot;natural&quot; and  &quot;normal.&quot;  This attitude is to blame for much of the horror  depicted in Bergner's book.<br />January 1999ng  any moral feat (in this case love of an enemy) impossible is always a moral  disgrace.

He spoke of alternatives or substitutes for prison, and also for factories,  schools, barracks, and hospitals, all of which he said resembled prisons.  But he said not one word about what such alternatives might be, and his  style struck me as pretentious.  So I didn't pay much attention.<br /> I  believed, of course, that we ought to have been devoting much more time and  money to alleviating poverty, educating children and adults, providing  decent homes and medical care, training people for enjoyable jobs, treating  the mentally ill and those addicted to drugs.  I believed that we in  America were wrong to allow people to live in horrible conditions, to  supply everyone with guns, and then to address crime after it happened.  But I didn't think much about the way in which we addressed it.<br /> I did  have some general, vague, and ill-informed complaints with our approach to  punishment.  I rejected the common demand for vengeance and the  philosophical demand for justice (a.k.a. vengeance) as barbaric and  counterproductive.  I was disgusted by the fact that our government  supported crime victims in believing that they could be helped by seeing  criminals suffer.  I opposed the death penalty because there was no  evidence that it deterred crime, saved money, or helped to civilize anyone.  The whole idea of vengeance seemed to conflict with reducing crime in many  ways.  Those &quot;mentally incompetent&quot; often couldn't be confined  for society's protection, and couldn't be given the help they needed if  they were confined.  Restitution was never made to victims or communities,  because those who ought to have been making it were locked away as  monsters.<br /> I didn't yet understand the degree to which prison trains  those monsters to be monsters, and teaches people to see society as an  enemy and themselves as wrongly treated.  Nor was I aware how little  evidence there is that prison (not just the death penalty) deters crime.  I  wasn't aware how unlikely recidivism is in many cases, or how small a  percentage of prisoners had been convicted of violent crimes.  I didn't  know how large a percentage of prisoners are mentally ill or addicted to  drugs.  Nor did I have much idea what went on in prisons, how torturous  imprisonment is, how solitary confinement produces insanity, how common  rape and murder are in our prisons.  Nor did I know anything about our  recently developed private prison industry, an industry without the  competition of the free-market, but also without the accountability or  financial stability of the government.  We now build unneeded prisons in  the hopes that prisoners can be found to make them profitable.  And there  are alternatives.<br /> Imprisonment is highest, and rising the fastest, in  the United States.  In Russia it is decreasing, and reliable numbers cannot  be obtained for China.  No other country is anywhere close to the U.S. in  rate of imprisonment in proportion to population.  Stern documents that  most penal reform reports by governments around the world &quot;begin by  questioning the efficacy of the institution of prison itself.&quot;  And  she questions the idea that the recent increase in incarceration in the  U.S. has reduced crime outside of prisons, either by deterrence or by  temporarily removing potential recidivists from society.  She goes on to  suggest that mass incarceration will increase crime by the destruction it  does to families and communities.<br /> Stern also cites studies showing  that Americans are less intent on massive incarceration than are their  elected representatives.  The cowardly appeals of &quot;hard on crime&quot;  politicians to the basest instincts of the majority may actually be  appealing to a minority.  The parallel with the Republican Congress's  recent impeachment of Bill Clinton, regardless of what the public might  want, is striking.<br /> In suggesting alternatives to prison, Stern  cites examples from New Zealand, Vermont, Quebec, Africa, and India.  The  U.S. could drastically reduce its prison population by treating drug use as  a medical, rather than a criminal, problem.  It could go further by  learning from some of the examples Stern cites in which greater use is made  of probation and community service, greater emphasis is placed on  restitution and answerability to victims.  In New Zealand an offender and  his or her family sit down with a victim and family and moderators to  arrive at a punishment acceptable to all, including an apology.  This is  not the U.S. version of victim involvement in which restitution and apology  play no part but the victim (who has no knowledge of the offender's  psychology) recommends a length of prison sentence.  As Stern puts it:<br />  &quot;With prison the victim is not healed.  The victim is forgotten.  The  community breach is not healed - but widened - and society has become more  dangerous.&quot;<br /> Clearly there is something flawed in the idea that  we can reduce crime by temporarily removing people from society, if while  they are removed they are trained to be more serious criminals and in fact  allowed to commit crimes against each other, and if nothing is done for the  wellbeing of those damaged by the removal of these people.  But there are  two reasons why many Americans want to proceed in this way nonetheless.  One is the desire for vengeance.  Let more crime victims be produced, this  thinking goes, as long as the current ones can be made to feel overwhelming  hatred for those who abused them.  The other reason, one which I think  Stern may underestimate and which may be less in some countries, is a  belief in the deterrent power of prison.the majority may actually be  appealing to a minority.

US	43735353	R2DK857JAPVC6	0195101960	831767435	A Short History of Philosophy	Books	5	64	68	N	N	An excellent history.	I had recently read the Norwegian novel &quot;Sophie's World,&quot; which is a short history of philosophy thinly disguised as a novel. It's the same as dozens of histories of philosophy written in the first part of this  century . . . or AS IF in the first part of this century. Under the  pretense of &quot;taking no position,&quot; it takes the position that all  of Western philosophy from Plato onward remains alive today as current  thought.<br />I read &quot;A Short History of Philosophy.&quot; with that  peculiar joy one has in finding a book one would like to have written  (which is no indication that one COULD have written it). Solomon and  Higgins, who write with a single and masterful voice, have here painted a  loving portrait of a long series of beliefs, the vast majority of which  Solomon and Higgins probably do not share. They are able to convey the  significance, at the time, of disputes that are now dead, and also the  importance of appreciating those disputes now, not only in order to  diagnose vestigial remains of them in current culture(s), and not only for  the benefit of future thought, but for their own sake as beautiful, if  abandoned, human creations.<br />Most histories of philosophy present a  series of philosophers as isolated individuals, one passing a torch neatly  to the next. At most the reader is informed of the nationality of each.  Solomon and Higgins correct for this by placing philosophers in their  cultural and political contexts. But they do not go to the opposite extreme  and make the mistake of thinking that philosophy does not in its turn have  a great effect on the rest of culture. Similarly, they strike a good and  sophisticated balance between emphasizing individuals and minimizing them  as parts of general trends. More importantly - and this is an obvious  reason why I could not have written this book, though I learned from other  parts of it as well - the authors include non-Western (mostly Eastern)  philosophy. They address what has been influential, but also what they hope  will be more influential, drawing out elements of Western thought that they  see as badly neglected, and pointing to non-Western notions that they see  as good antidotes (or correctives, not places to rest but useful tools for  change) to Western ones. The book points out both actual points of contact  between historic cultures, and similarities between them regardless of any  known influence. This is helped by the method of interweaving numerous  stories as required by chronological order. But I should note that  similarities are mentioned as an aid to understanding, not at all as an  attempt to hint at any a-cultural &quot;truth.&quot;<br />Also helpful is the  refusal to distinguish between religion and philosophy, and the consequent  inclusion of a Short History of Religion scattered through the book. As the  authors point out, the idea of such a distinction is a very recent one, and  is thus not helpful in describing past traditions. Various thinkers not  always labeled philosophers are included as well. There are some excellent  passages on Montaigne.<br />The Short History is written in ordinary American  English loaded with turns of phrase the authors may themselves find  questionable: &quot;the very nature of,&quot; &quot;objectivity,&quot;  &quot;subjectivism,&quot; &quot;reality itself,&quot;  &quot;essential,&quot; &quot;rationally,&quot; &quot;irrationality.&quot;  The origins and dubitability of many of these notions are discussed in the  book (early comments on the expression &quot;natural&quot; set the tone),  and yet elsewhere they are used as if we are all agreed upon their  comprehensibility and usefulness. One can find on one page a good  discussion of problems with the notion of rationality, and on another the  word &quot;irrationality&quot; used without explanation to refer to the  Nazi Holocaust. The book is thus, in a very broad sense, written, as  Derrida would put it, &quot;under erasure.&quot; Words are used because  they are part of the language of the book's intended audience, despite the  fact that the authors might prefer to abandon (or change the meaning of)  those words. In only two cases do I find this troublesome. On the whole it  seems to me both wise and unavoidable. The most troublesome case is the  phrase &quot;commonsense.&quot; Numerous discussions of the misuse and  abuse of this phrase are here published together with numerous uses of it,  some of them rather unhelpfully scare-quoted and others not. The other case  that bothers me is a single instance of the phrase &quot;from a  philosophical point of view,&quot; in a work that seems largely devoted to  opening up the question of what thing or things that has meant and can  mean.<br />In the preface Solomon and Higgins state their intention to  &quot;keep our own biases out of the text.&quot; But I credit them with  near-recognition of the near-meaninglessness of that statement. The last  sections of the book, dealing with the interaction of diverse cultures,  point out the all-too-common danger of taking one's own point of view for  an absence of bias. This book would offend a great many philosophy  professors, especially in the English speaking world. Various beliefs are  described as so absurd that the philosopher must have been joking. Other  ideas are lamented for the damage they've done.<br />I am not complaining. I  share the authors' biases, and imagine that a great many other people do  too. The book is excellently written, clear, rich, dense. A good  bibliography is provided.ure.&quot; Words are used because  they are part of the language of the book's intended audience, despite the  fact that the authors might prefer to abandon (or change the meaning of)  those words.
