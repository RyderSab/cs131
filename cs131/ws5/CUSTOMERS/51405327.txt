I have not read the othe concoctions books people are talking about, but I did buy this one after seeing a woman on Living It Up with Ali & Jack. I could only remember the book had the name concoctions in it. My neighbor then informed me that I had purchased the wrong book. Oh well, I am not returning the book, but I am a little concerned that other people are making the same unfortunate mistake. In an age where money is hard to come by it is very sad that publishers would create look a like books wiht similar names. This book seems to benefit from the overwhelming success of the other series, I am sure that is not by mistake. In any event I will be purchasing the other books because that is what I was looking for. I looked over this book with by children and there was very little interest on their part, they only want to make the projects they saw on TV, which are NOT in this book. The book is a good concept, but is very average at best.	2004-06-13

Becareful, I read a review here that said that this is the book from PBS... It IS NOT. I bought the book after reading the review and just sent it back. It is not even by the same authors who wrote the PBS book. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this sounds like  a scam job at the expense of children and their parents. I may have kept the book if I wasn't so upset about being deceived. If you are looking for the PBS book it is called \\"The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions\\" by John & Danita Thomas. I have sent an email to the authors about this rip off book, I hope they take some type of action.	2004-06-11

I also made the mistake of thinking this book was the book from the PBS show Kid Concoctions as did my sister. I'm sure many others are doing the same. This book is not bad, the problem is that it is very upsetting feeling that you were tricked into buying a knock off. Even if it isn't a knock off, that is the perception many of us have. Not to mention the fact that my kids could not make any of the project they saw on TV with this book. I suggest the publisher change the name to someting more original.  Just my thoughts.	2004-03-15

This is the first review I have written and will most likly be the last. I am a 73 year old retired teacher and current educational consultant. This innovative book has changed and continues to change the way children learn and educators teach. I strongly reccmond this book to young (and old) teachers who are looking to make the learning process fun. After all education can be fun and as educators it is our job to do what ever it takes to teach children to think and be creative. Not just recite memorized material like a minor bird. I commend the authors of this series on using their creativity to assemble this wonderful learning tool.  You deserve this classic all time best-seller I wish I had a copy when I was a young mother with 4 children.	2003-04-10

I run a day home and with Christmas coming up it was wonderful to find so many ideas for the little ones to do.   First, we made the Chocolate Kisses for them to give their parents for Chrismas.  <br />A BIG one for the dads and a smaller one for the moms. :-)  Actually, I already had some white chocolate at home, so I bought some bags of butterscotch chips and mixed them in and got caramel chocolate, so that's what the dads got and the moms got the real chocolate.  We wrapped them in cellophane and put them in gift bags so they look really cute.  I also put little strips of paper in the tops saying 'dad, you're the best' and 'we love you, mom.'  Needless to say, one of my daughters saw them and wanted to know where hers is.  by the way,  she's married with children.<br />We have also made the applesauce/cinnamon ornaments this week, so at the moment they are drying and next week we will decorate them with glitter and so on.  The kids had a ball kneeding the dough in the plastic bag.  They sat in a circle and passed it around so everyone could have a squeeze.  To tell the truth I was a little skeptical that it would turn into dough, but 'presto', it worked.<br />Tommorow I am going on a hunt for the red and white Christmas candy to make the candy wreaths.  as crazy as it sounds, so far I have not been able to find it in Calgary, so I am hoping to find some of it somewhere so that we can make the wreaths next week.<br />Oh, and I nearly forgot, I also tried the Ice Cream, but that was for me. :-)<BR>I have just ordered your 2 previous books and can't wait to get them.<BR>Thanks again for the lovely ideas.<BR>Margaret in Calgary, Alberta.	2001-12-10

As a professional crafter and teacher for over 30 years, I honestly have to say that &quot;The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions&quot; is hands down the best craft book ever written to date.

My students where in their glory when we made over 200 batches of Funny Putty and over 200 Treasure Stones for our school fund raiser.
