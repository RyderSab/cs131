US	49245705	R1OZ9PUXSM8053	0451457595	636012456	The River's Gift	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Cute	As this is being my first title read by Lacky I have nothing else to base her writings on, although i must say that I enjoyed the story.  I thought it was cute, and although it was a bit predictable it had its own innocent and altruistic qualities.  I didn't purchase this book, i got it from the local library, and I wouldn't buy it...because 16$ for that is quite a lot of money.  LOL.<br />I felt that Merod should have been developed more, and I also thought that he should have been less &quot;dainty&quot;.  He is supposed to be this luring &amp; ominous creature and yet he falls in love with a mortal, that which he has despised his whole being.<br />I could appreciate that the girl had these healing abilities, and I did wonder if her mother could do the same.  I also wondered why she didn't make an attemp to heal her father when he had his &quot;heart attack&quot;.  It was sappy and cute and allowed for my needed catharsis at that moment so I cannot be too disappointed.  I feel that if you are going to read this then remind yourself that it is a damned short story and won't have tons of character development.	2003-10-12

When you read most sequels they are really bland, over played and the story is just lame.  but J. K. Rowling is one of the greatest authors I have ever read!  Of course I know some people won't agree with me, but this was one of the most emotionally encapsulating novels I have read in ages.  I laughed, I cried, I was angered into complete tension, I was saddened to the point of mourning...it was an amazing emotional journey.<br />We welcome a few new characters and welcome back old ones as well.  Number 12 Grimmauld place, Hogwarts, and the ministry of magic are the mainsteads of this book, and of course we welcome professor Umbridge, Professor Firenze (the centaur), and we even get to get closer to Cho Chang, Ginny Weasly, Professor Dumbledore, and get even closer to the dark and evil Malfoy's.<br />Jokes a million from prankesters Fred and George and their new cohort Lee.  Ron gets serious for a change, O.W.L.s are intense, and of course the love grows.  professor snape gewt cornered, and Lucious Malfoy gets his!  Don't miss this 5 installment of Harry Potter and the Order Of The Pheonix.<br />I promise you will be glad you read it, now whether you like it or not is your own business.<br />Male teen angst, female hormones, and all of the other things you feel as you are growing up are captured nicely in this book!  3 cheers for fellow witch J. K. Rowling!	2003-07-10

Tolkien has again proved to be a genius as an author.  A world created for the sole purpose of showing what true love, friendship, and heart can do.<br />Delightful, inspiring, and even tormenting.  The vivid descriptions make you feel like you were there in Middle Earth with Frodo, Sam, and the others from th Fellowship.  A must read for people of all ages, and even good for those who just love a good story.  you don't have to enjoy fantasy novels to enjoy the lord of the rings.	2003-02-15

I was captivated by the story, the characters, and most of all the morals underlying.  I feel like these books should be read by everyone at least once in their lives.  No matter if it discusses magic or not it should be read by everyone.  This book has so many things about it to remind you that even though you are a muggle or a wizard and witch you can all have a chance to achieve the same goals.  <br />Harry is an amazing character, and I can only hope to get to the 5th book ASAP.  These books are abslutly amazing!  CHEERS to J.K. Rowling for such a good tale.  I would like to think that in the future these will be written up until Harry has children and such...I don't like to speculate about what the author menat to say!	2003-01-19

One is you can hate it, and two you can love it.  I am not sure if there is a much of in-between in this novel.  The only reason i say this is because if you look at its content, a very touchy subject of 2 women loving and having a sexual relationship, then you can either love or despise this.<br />&lt;u>In all actuality if you don't like it, it is because one you are narrow minded or two because you can't follow the erratic way in which the story is told.&lt;/u>  I finished this book in three hours...and i loved every damn word of it.  But I guess it all depends on who you are.  ;0<br />I think that this book should be read by anyone that can sympathize with bisexuals or those whom are polyamourus.	2002-12-31

I have seen that often with Ms. Giovanni's work.  I don't like to read something and feel like I am being pulled into a debate of slavery and hostility.

It seems to me that Micheal Baisden is a friendly author.  An author that after you read one book, you warm up to his style and it's like a best friend welcoming you to read more of his words.  This book has caught my attention, not only for its content and the characters, but the style.  It's simple, yet complex at the same time.  Words flow and the story follows along, as if it was prefection in the making.  The story becomes apart of you after you read it, this is not a tale I will easily forget.<br />The story is cool, until it gets to the cheating.  Men of course have a lot to learn as do females in the love department.  I must say I am tired of reding books where someone down talks interracil dating, it just brings poeple closer together, preparing the open minded ones to separate racism from common sence.  The topic are well written and are especially controversial, and that makes things clear and relevant.  I feel like that reading it I was set aside and wans't inside the story, race separated, there were bounderies.  I don't like that, the story must be able to relate to all who would even like to eventually read the book.  If you close people off when you write it safe to say you do it IRL.  Which is lame.  But enough of that, the story is good, and it's well written!	2002-07-28

This is definatly a book that will capture the heart of it's reader, and instill a spark of hope.  The beauty of this book, is all the events that take place are things that can and do happen in real life.  This is the follow up to &quot;What looks like Crazy on an Ordinary Day&quot; and I must say this is by far even better.  I found it to be moving, and not as flaky as most of the books I have been finding.  I am glad I looked this book up at the library.<br />Most novels that women write about the issues that they go through are trashed, and spread a bad word about.  But with this book I will pass it on, and with pride.  The joys and pains of the characters and of course Idlewild has become a home in so many others hearts because of it's ability to capture truth.<br />I reccomend this book to male and female;s of all race, denominations, and creeds.  This is definatly something that will become spellbinding.<br />--	2002-07-23

Hot Pepper is a true antagonist, and well Wild Ginger I don't know what to say about her.  Her betrayal was more than I could stand, and her thoughts were not to better herself but to show those in power, Chairman Moa, that she wan't dirt nor was she a French  spy even tho she was mixed, and her mother a Chinese Opera singer was loyal.  Between the pain of a mother who betrays you before you are bron according to Wild Ginger by marrying a White, French man, and having a child, and moving back to Communist China in the 50's that just made things even worse.<br />Maple befriends Wild Ginger, and of course Ginger saves Maple from being beaten down by Hot Pepper...and a bond forms.  A bond destinted for failure...through circumstance and fate.  Evergreen a man/boy who follows much of the culteral revolution fnds himself torn between loving a woman who has made an oath to remain true to Chairman Moa and she loves him but insists that denying her feelings will get her where she wants to be.  This is a tragic story crossed with love, anger, hate, and even beauty.<br />THis is a courageous story and I cannot say I have just picked a book from the library randomly that was this good in a long time!  :)  I read it in less then 6 hours, all 224 pages, and enjoyed every bit.  It actually made me want to question my  mom about the time and look up more of Maoism.  :)	2002-07-18

I found myself finishing this book in a day just to read what would happen next.  I was ready...I had my comforter on me, laying on the bed, and even at work while I was watching the kids...I read.  The literary language of this book is audacious and bold, and that sets it apart from most novels.  Although when I read the passion and intelect that was poised in this novel I know that there are still some good men out there.<br />Malcolm Tremell a gigalo, a player, and a fine brotha has been a gigalo for 12 years and when faced with the choice to hang up his boots and fall in love or enjoy the bebefits of beautiful women, beautiful sex, and lots of money.

Sadly most of the reviews i read were bashing the content not the style.  things that make you go hmmm!!!!<br />This is about bisexuality and even polyamory.

I found myself laughing at the basics of Lisa because even as complex as she was she couldn't be complex enough to understand love and its many traits and faces.  Elliott Salter is a handsom and riveting character...he was well planned in my opinion and even well written.  One can just imagine how he would have really looked if they would have done the movie \\"exact\\" but then again they never do.<br />I found this book a little more mellow and easy to read then some on Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles that I had started before.  Then again I found Tolkien a bit hard at times as well...maybe it's just me.  But she brought out another side of herself as a writer in this book and I enjoyed the story.  The sex scenes weren't as graphic as I would have liked, I expected serious S & M and I found only mild play at some points.  I would have liked to have seen the arcade described a little bit more.  Just small things.  This book is not for the light hearted though...if sexual acts still remain taboo in your mind and family then stay away from this novel.	2002-05-22

His quick wit and serious situations make you want to keep going throughout the story.  If you put it down for a few minutes you are literally craving to begin again.  ]<br />I saw the movie first because my fianc&eacute; pointed out that it would be worth my while.  I had never taken the time to read these books before.  I saw the movie and was awe struck.<br />The book is full of fun adventures, interesting people, like Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and the famous Bilbo.  I think if Leonard Nimoy would have read this book then istead of Bilbo being &quot;The greatest little hobbit of them all&quot;  Frodo would have been talked about more.<br />I liked the story, dialouge, and the vivid presentation of all the people, places, and things the fellowshop comes across.  Spontaneous, sad, happy, and merry are only a few words that I could use to describe the story.  All inspiring and fun Tolkien is a master of the Fantasy tale.  I enjoyed this tale, continuing the saga is a must.  It just isn't right any other way.  READ THESE BOOKS!  If you like fantasy, adventure, drama, and comedy rolled into one book!	2002-01-04

I didn't think that this book would be very good at first because I don't like books about wars and the tiring trifles of war either.  I set out determined to finish this book even if I didn't like it though.<br />I started reading it and finished it three days later.  The book begins with the author Helie Lee talking about how her grandmother doesn't like that she is 25 and not married yet.  But in America things are different.  THrough the first two or three chapters the narritive voice changes to Helie's Grandmother Baek, Lee.  Korean's said the last name first.  It is cool how the descrisption is so vivid and honest.  I think that this is a great book for lovers of literature.<br />Powerful and Poingant, the pain, happiness, and love is felt throughout!	2001-12-25

I began relating to this character, and seeing her as myself for a bit there.  I felt like I was inside this story.  Fiona, the main character or main character emphasis--is a desperate woman in love with a married man.  Not totally unbelieveable...it happens everyday.  The narraitve voice Evelyn Lau takes as this character is very vivid and honest.<br />this is a very alive, and hip piece of new age writing.  It surpasses most fiction, mainly because it has a emotional fixation with the reader, you are either angry, depressed, happy or totally miffed at the aftions of each character.  Raymond, Fiona's love whom is married, will not leave his wife of 15 years for Fiona and woman he has never even sexual intercourse with.<br />Fiona in a desperate attempt to persue Raymond and make her dream of eternal love with him ends up becoming an alcoholic...she spends most of hert time doting and thinking of him.  Every man she sees reminds her of Raymond...nothing wrong with that.  Is it mere obsession or real love?  Who knows...I won't tell my opinion...<br />The lyrical aspect of each sentence keeps you engrossed the whole time, and you almost want more when you finish.  i loved her wording, and her narritive voice...very powerful and different I must say!	2001-11-01

Sandras writing.  She has a provocative style, measuring up to the filail piety of a &quot;erotic&quot; poet.<br />She has a loud voice, with silent words, and nails emotion like a new born baby.  Her screams of love, life and secret deeds...makes all want to kee reading her work.  Her world seems like a very interesting place to be, and I almost wonder if she will be one of the GREATS one day.  I love her masculine, and feminie varients between living and loving...I think she is great at evoking emotion.<br />My favorite poem from this book is about her &quot;period&quot;.  A time when woman hood is at its peak, and you are maturing.  It has an honest and vigilent ring that most people would cringe at.  I LOVE HER WORK!

I read On Writing first by him, and was hooked, by line and sinker on that one.  His poetry freed my mind and taught me a little something that I didn't know before.  Something different.  I really liked Roland to be the bad guy in good situations.  I didn't know how to respond to that!  I was touched and I was intrigued all at the same time.

I read in On Writing that he doiesn't think of plot before he writes his books, and maybe that is why he is so well versed!  I like to think I would write books like he one day.  I really enjoyed this story as much as the first, and I am in suspense as I read the third,  and the fourth.  I am ready for just about anything but I am sure I will be nothing more than surprised as always!  Stephen King is THE MAN~!  If I had one wish I would want to meet him and actually get to know him as a person!	2000-11-23

They knew that the way they were brought up was tp protect them from the evils of their pasts, so their daughters wouldn't turn out like they did.  I was moved by this brilliant and astounding story, I hope that when I have kids they know they are loved as muh as these daughters in the story knew!~<br />Anyway, I really enjoyed this book and the movie...I was moved to tears, and I think that if you want a nice chick book to read this is it for you!  Also if you like to cry sometimes~	2000-11-15

When I first started the martial arts my sensei reccomended this book for me to read.  He told me it would give me basic understanding of strategy, (for now that is) and some balance when it comes to understanding combat.  I learned a lot in the manuel by  Mushashi, more than I can learn on my own.  The wise words, and absolute ways are something that we should all understand as people.<br />I reccomend this to any one training in ANY martial art!	2000-11-13

In this tale, though hard to get into, I find that the story is decent and well thought out. Danzy Senna's perception of the girls os amazing, and how they were feeling as they grew up, and how they felt because their family was seperated! This is a awesome story of love, and the love we sometimes forget comes with being family!	2000-11-12

I haven't read too many of his books, although I have a stack of them a firend gave to me to read, I bought this because I myself am a writer and wanted to see another writer's perspective on things.  I have always enjoyed reading about the craft of writing.  This book not only tells a story about how Mr. King (I give his due respect) got into writing in the first place, and how he was rejected and rejected and rejected, but then one day, magic happens!  He is accepted to have a book or novella or story (I cannot remember off the top of my head) published.<br />He is an AWESOME writer and I have a lot of respect for him and his wife as writers and people.  I hope that all readers and writers alike enjoyed this book as much as I.  I give this book two thumbs up from my hand and 2 from my friends hand!  I LOVED this book!  Hope you do too!	2000-10-13

I liked te story, although I was a bit dissapoointed to know that her and  Victor didn't get together in the end of the book.  I thought that there  should have been more to the story, she went strait to thetop, no one has  it that good all the time!  That is how you know it is a fictional  character.  I thought that it was creative in the way he made it seem like  she was a real person but I think that like others said it did lack  substance.  I give this a 4 because therewas definate thoguht put into the  book, and I think that there was definatly some things that should've been  changed around.  I thought that there should ahve been more emphasis on the  struggles that she would go through as a black woman, in Hollywood at that.  You cans ee that OPmar Tyree is a talented man, and I admire that about  him, but there has to be something more to your story, I thought Flyy Girl  was a page tunrner, and if you read this after taht you can sorley  dissappointed!  I hate to say it, but I like the way it was written but  there was no story really!  I mean what hapeened to realism?	2000-08-22

Who  knows if Rbecca Wells really went through that, but it wasa good solid  story.  It wasn't anything that would mkaw you have some severe turn around  in life, but it proves that love can conquer all.  It wasa cute story about  a group of women who were such good friends they made up a  &quot;sisterhood&quot;  i can relate to this story because I have many  friends I consider to be family.

True that the author isn't a Jpanese women, living in Kyoto, Japan, in the  year 1940 something.  But I thought it was a great story about someone who  may have lived back then.  It's why we call it fiction that we are allowed  to go into the minds of others if we please, and make up or own story of  what it may have been life for real.  It's not too far fetched to believe  this may have been what a Japanese woman would have been subjected too.  I  have a Jpanese Grandmother, and I think this is pretty true to life, by  what she told me.  And I like that Aruthr Golden didn't make the Geisha  seem like a whore, because she is not a whore, but an artist.  Somone who  endures many years of hard training, with sweat, blood and tears.  I  enjoyed this tale of Sayuri. I hope you will too!	2000-08-09

This book is a good book, but you have to really be willing to expericne emotions such as hate through out the story.  You have to be ready for let downs.  I was apalled at this  book, and ho the ending came about.  The main character is Shelby, and her  boyfriend Tyrel, i think that this either needs a sequel or something,  cause you just don't leave your audience hanging on after they have made  such a bold attempt at reading the book in the first place.  The story was  good, but by the end you are so angry with some of the characters you  almost don't want to finish it.  But over and all it was a pretty good  concept, and the character's were set up great.  So...if you are willing to  go the extra mile, then you'll enjoy this book.	2000-07-24
