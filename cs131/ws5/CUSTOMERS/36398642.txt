These characters are earthy and real, common folk with endearing foibles and vulnerabilities.  Schaffert breathes life into his characters with a delicate touch, lending a<br /><br />poignant dignity to even the oddest misfit.<br /><br />Hud Smith writes mournful country songs and drinks more than he should.  He lives above the shoe repair shop on the square in a fading Nebraska town but dreams of reconciling with his ex-wife, Tuesday.  Every dream he ever had has fallen through, but despite his dreary life, Hud faces every day with hope and humor.  He plays piano and sings at a nearby Ramada, fending off lonely women who find his music appealing, living for the day his family will be restored.<br /><br />Tuesday's mothering skills are somewhat lacking.  She barely<br /><br />has the energy and drive to supervise their eight year old daughter, Nina. Nina is an irrepressible child who sings off key and makes up graceless dance steps.  Whatever Nina does, Hud finds adorable and brilliant.  He adores his quirky daughter and imagines stealing her away from Tuesday to<br /><br />keep her with him all the time.  Their seventeen year old son Gatling has run away from home to play guitar and sing backup with The Daughters of God, an iconic Christian rock group.  Nina is all Hud and Tuesday have left to remind them of a marriage that once brought joy.  All three dream of having<br /><br />Gatling back home where he belongs and set off in a borrowed schoolbus to find him.<br /><br />Circulating around this mismatched threesome are an equally strange mix of friends, neighbors, and churchgoers who speak their own dark language.  The story is often humorous, but is not a cruel parody of life's rejects.  These are lives made up of large and small failures, joys, and negotiations.  And Schaffert makes them shine.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-10

Anne Johnson is fifty years old, recently divorced from a faithless husband, and not suffering in the slightest from that loss.  At age fifty, Carr's heroine is still feisty and fit.  She lives in a spacious luxury apartment in Washington D.C. and enjoys her quiet time curled up reading by the fireplace. Life is fine just the way it is.  She's quite comfortable with her current situation except for missing sex and hopes her hunky neighbor, Ivan Chernislava, might rectify that shortfall.<br /><br />One night while sipping a martini, a voice comes to Anne out of nowhere.  \\"A murder will occur in sixty days.  Prevent it.\\"  Anne wonders if that disembodied voice is due to one too many martinis, or if she's finally fallen into schizophrenia but decides preventing a murder might be entertaining for awhile at least.  She enlists the help of Mary, a savvy Rubenesque cleaning lady, to help find the potential murderer.  Their list of suspects includes the sexually robust Ivan, whom Anne lustily \\"investigates\\" as often as her strength allows.  She and Mary plan a cocktail party for residents of her apartment complex, in hopes of uncovering the murderer, dragging Anne's ex-husband, children, and Mary's husband into their scheme.  The results are often hilarious but just as frequently hair raising as these two friends track down a killer.	2005-09-30

Critics have been praising the writings of Charles Potts since his Berkeley days in 1968.  Readers too young to remember the turbulent Sixties will get a first hand view through Potts' eyes.  From his youthful struggle with ill health and schizophrenia to this present day, his voice has always been a force of truth.  His poetry is breath taking, often lyrical and occasionally profane but always clearly focused.  His prose in the form of essays and commentaries reveals injustice, environmental tragedies, or life experienced by lost and broken people our politicians ignore.<br /><br />The book is divided chronologically into decades and specific topics of interest.  Despite his mental unraveling in the Sixties, Potts focused on the words that drove him.  \\"Valga Krusa\\" is an early memoir written in the throes of schizophrenia.  In a style reminiscent of Kerouac, his voice resonates clearly above the din that was his fractured mind at the time.  Jail time for marijuana use, travels in Mexico and experiences with friends and lovers give readers an unsettling view of the milieu that fed Potts' creativity, and precipitated his mental breakdown.  It's a timeless chronicle that educates and enlightens with stark honesty.<br /><br />In the Seventies, Potts is still struggling through a maze created by his earlier schizophrenia, but his work is visionary, clearly focused. \\"The Golden Calf\\" contains a succinct self description of those years:<br /><br />  I go on sheer nerve<br /><br />  Hear tiny nerve cells burning out<br /><br />His interest in politics and war takes on a definite edge, which he expresses with anger tempered with humor.  During this time he also creates poetry that is beautifully and thoughtfully written as Potts heals himself and searches for<br /><br />renewal:<br /><br />  When the bloom is on the sage<br /><br />  And the mountain bluebirds fly<br /><br />  Through my garden on the floor<br /><br />  Of old Lake Bonneville<br /><br />  My heart goes over Red<br /><br />  Rock Pass.<br /><br />  River of exaggerated violence<br /><br />  I navigate you badly<br /><br />  But in my dreams<br /><br />  I'm coming home to stay.<br /><br />His work in the Eighties demonstrates anger somewhat softened by love.  Potts is quieter, maybe exhausted, but not resigned to the status quo and far from losing his bite.  He continues to speak for an entire generation suspicious of politicians and government schemes.<br /><br />Through the Nineties to the present, Potts grieves over<br /><br />squandered assets and natural resources, lost to war and<br /><br />greed.  He ruthlessly dissects the bombast fed to citizens through the media, sweeps away political smoke screens to reveal the underlying hypocrisy, and creates awesome paeans to the natural world he loves.  When politicians declare war on despots because of ethnic cleansing, Potts reminds us all that the U.S.A. is a continental monument to ethnic cleansing.  We accomplished our cleansing violently, and did it in the guise of \\"manifest destiny.\\"  He reminds us that Separation of Church and State is a political smoke screen  because they have been powerful bedfellows since before the Revolutionary War.  And he<br /><br />provides a fascinating history of Texas that none of us will ever learn in school.  But amidst the hard-edged essays and commentaries he shares his frailty and grief in \\"Wild Horse\\", written when his wife Ann died:<br /><br />  There's frost on the grass<br /><br />  In Wild Horse this morning.<br /><br />  I love you Annie always.<br /><br />  Here among the grasses and the trees<br /><br />  You'll become part of<br /><br />  The life force of Wild Horse<br /><br />  My sweet baby<br /><br />  My beautiful innocent wife<br /><br />  Gone forever<br /><br />  But still here inside me<br /><br />  In my crying arms and bones.<br /><br />Potts' work is exemplary.

Charles Potts has aptly named this breathtaking retrospective of his early work Kiot -- the Coyote --  the wary trickster and cagey loner, announcing his existence with penetrating voice.  Like the coyote, Potts wanders through time and the cosmos, heralding his protest and outrage with a voice that cuts through human imagination and registers at our prehistoric core.<br /><br />One poem alone -- \\"Obit Mirage\\" -- is worth the price of this book.  In it, Potts reveals multi-layered worlds within worlds with such skill and grace that only one reading barely scrapes the surface of its content:<br /><br />  My people came<br /><br />  On a rickety ship<br /><br />  From the Favorsham<br /><br />  To the land of profits...<br /><br />From the \\"land of profits\\", Potts takes us on a journey that enlightens, then amazes with his wily use of words.

With equal ability, he also uses humor and irony while moving forward and backward through generations, addressing religion, class distinctions, government trickeries and lies.

When Dan Brown confirmed that he is writing a sequel to The DaVinci Code, investigative journalist David Shugarts set out to discover the potential plot.  Who is or was the widow's son and why is this a continuing thread throughout the book?  The search for cryptic clues imbedded in Brown's first book lead to intriguing possibilities.<br /><br />Shugarts' book is intelligently written and never dry or boring.  Even if Secrets of The Widow's Son were not a commentary on Dan Brown's writings it would be interesting to contemplate.  Shugarts spans history and geography to deliver information we did not learn in school.  Clues unearthed in his investigation reveal mysteries that have been hidden in plain sight since the founding of America.  Our founding fathers played integral parts in these mysteries.<br /><br />Shugarts' presents clues originating in ancient times and continuing in America today.  Washington DC, for example, houses secret crypts, symbols, and cyphers.  Our nation's capitol is a hotbed of Egyption obelisks, Masonic symbols, and<br /><br />disguised references to Knights Templar, Jesuits, and the Illuminati.  The appendices were as intriguing as the book so be sure to read them.<br /><br />Perhaps you'll find the \\"key\\" to Dan Brown's next book here.  Even if you don't, and Brown surprises Shugarts and his fans, this book is well worth reading.	2005-09-19

Despite strong language, sex, and violence, this second in the Star Wood Leigh series is more than simply a gossipy Hollywood potboiler.  The Hollywood scene is not the glorious life fans think it is.  \\"All that glitters is not gold.\\" and Anderson makes that point extremely well.<br /><br />When Star wakes up in a luxury Cabo hotel room wearing<br /><br />nothing but Gucci boots and a huge diamond ring, holding a Colt .45 in her hand, she knows serious trouble awaits.  She can't remember anything about the days preceding that moment.  Tied up in her bed is world class rock star Jimi Deed, who tells her they were married following a marathon drinking spree and love fest enhanced by the drug Ecstasy.  Star is shocked.  She has always avoided the drug scene and bad boys like Jimi. Despite her gorgeous face and stunning figure, Star is vulnerable, a smart, endearing woman with her own firm code and scruples.  Her growing love for Jimi wrecks Star's world. The paparazzi hound them every waking moment.  Their solution to this problem takes Star to a dark side of fame she can't escape, where not even family ties can be trusted.<br /><br />Star lives in a world twisted by fame's trappings. She is too beautiful, too successful, too rich, too vulnerable, too<br /><br />everything and loses her perspective.  Critics who panned this book may have missed the author's message:  money can't buy everything and beauty coupled with fame can destroy lives.	2005-09-19

US	36398642	RZV5HZC1TJC0	1932961100	731727050	Angel and Apostle	Books	5	6	6	N	N	a memorable debut novel, beautifully written	At the end of Nathaniel Hawthorne's timeless novel, The Scarlet Letter, Hester Prynne's daughter Pearl has been born, raised, and lives in Europe. Angel and Apostle begins when Pearl is a child in Massachusetts and follows her life through adulthood.  Ms. Noyes weaves an enthralling account of what Pearl's life might have been in the mid-to-late 17th century.  The character<br /><br />and plot development are first rate as Noyes captures the true essence of Pearl's personality, life, and times.<br /><br />Life has been difficult for Pearl and her outcast mother.  Townfolk shun the dignified adulterous woman who wears the letter \\"A\\" over her heart like a badge of courage.  These same merciless Puritans call Pearl \\"the devil's spawn.\\"  Their only kindness and support comes from a frail, gentle hearted<br /><br />minister.  Pearl is a precocious child blessed with a vivid imagination and her father's restless spirit.  She loves the forests and seashore, the wild animals, and spends her days exploring the area around her cottage.  One day she ventures near the home of a wealthy shipping family, the Miltons, and<br /><br />meets their youngest son, Simon.  Simon is blind.  His older brother, Nehemiah, loves Simon but has always considered him a burden.  Reluctantly, he allows Pearl to introduce Simon to the natural world she loves.  The relationship between Pearl and the Miltons grows over time, and in the process changes the lives of everyone around them.<br /><br />With quietly savage prose, Deborah Noyes takes Pearl to adulthood, marriage, and motherhood.  We experience her life in America and England, the blossoming of love, and the heartbreak borne of passion and loss.  Readers smell the sea, the bite of chill air, and live the very heartbeats of each character.<br /><br />This book is a literary classic and highly recommended.	2005-09-05

Despite his wealth and business success, T's life is a shambles.  Walker lost his family and reputation unexpectedly.  This trip to a place he was once happy is a frantic effort to regain peace and focus.  He's empty, emotionally isolated, and hoping a return to old<br /><br />haunts near Wolf Point will help him feel alive again.  Well, be careful what you hope for, T, because you just might get it!<br /><br />Hitching a ride north is the type of blonde few men could pass by, no matter how many warning bells go off in their heads.  Jenny Cross is curvaceous, oozing sexuality.  Hitching with her is Lester, a macho tough guy carrying a guitar case.  From the moment Jenny slides into the seat beside T, she plays the sweet seductress, a purring nubile kitten.  Lester, on the other hand, has a troubling, threatening edge.  T mentally prepares for trouble sooner or later in their journey.<br /><br />The games begin immediately and accelerate once T, Jenny, and Lester reach a cabin at Wolf Point.  Plans to rob T and steal his SUV are put on temporary hold when Jenny and Lester decide their benefactor might give them $60,000 if they play him right.  Jenny shares Lester's story during quiet times<br /><br />cuddling with T, who's more than twice her age.  Lester tells him Jenny's story while fishing, leaving T to sort the truth from fiction.  T knows instinctively that lives are in the balance, but will it be his or theirs?<br /><br />The tale is told suspensefully through dysfunctional characters whose flaws are handled sympathetically by a gifted wordsmith.  Wolf Point is quintessential Falco as he skillfully reveals the darker twists and frailties of human nature.	2005-09-05

Lake Geneva is an enclave populated by powerful, influential \\"old money\\" families cocooned inside their mansions for generations.  Ellie expects a leisurely shoot, free of the danger and murder she seems to attract like a magnet.  As she returns home, her thoughts are on daughter Rachel, now 15 and not so easy for a single mom to<br /><br />handle.  At a rest area between Lake Geneva and Chicago, Ellie overhears a cell phone conversation and pauses to converse with a troubled young woman.  Seconds later, a pick up truck speeds past and the woman standing beside her is shot.

And all the while a murderer is breathing down her neck.<br /><br />A Shot to Die For is Hellmann at her very best yet.  Plot development is masterful as it builds towards a shocking climax.

Alessio Zanelli is making a name for himself internationally.  His work has been featured in journals originating in<br /><br />Australia, Canada, Iceland, UK, US, and others.  His poetry contemplates life, love, loss, the environment, the stablizing<br /><br />influence of family, and does so with passion.<br /><br />Old World rhythms often accentuate his words in pleasing ways, as in this excerpt from \\"Dedi\\":<br /><br />  Wiser would you have been<br /><br />  Had you never stolen<br /><br />  The richest sighs from me<br /><br />  Together with my only treasure.<br /><br />In a surprisingly tender remembrance, \\"Mom's Dad Bigio\\", Zanelli portrays his grandfather as talented pianist, lover of wine, and a man forced to entertain the Nazis in his home while his wife and children hid themselves away.  War's impact on three generations is clear in this excerpt:<br /><br />  .....My mom's dad Bigio<br /><br />  Is said to have had large hands and<br /><br />  A heart so big!  Then why is it<br /><br />  That mine are not as big?<br /><br />  I have no music in my fingers.<br /><br />  I don't drink to excess.<br /><br />  I have no kids to feed,<br /><br />  Nor the SS reveling at home.<br /><br />Zanelli is a world traveler whose fascination with the history of American Indians lends poignant power to his words. Consider this excerpt from \\"I Once Met a Man in Navajoland\\":<br /><br />  I have seen -- sunk into your eyes --<br /><br />  The Spirit of a great man, of an entire nation.<br /><br />  But now you poorly earn your living<br /><br />  By selling pendants of stone on the fringe of Grand Canyon.<br /><br />  When it is the time, man, I --<br /><br />  Who live six thousand miles away,<br /><br />  On the other side of the large sea<br /><br />  That you have never even seen --<br /><br />  I would like my soul to ride with yours....<br /><br />Another tribute to America and her indigenous people is the haunting and beautiful \\"I've Seen.\\"  This poem does not lend itself well to excerpt.  I tried because it's a favorite, but choosing small portions of it detracts from the whole experience.  In \\"Dineh Ritual of Recall\\", Zanelli witnesses a<br /><br />Navajo ritual:<br /><br />  Sort of a privileged intruder -- now I too can<br /><br />  Perceive the raped earth's wail.  Vacant-looking<br /><br />  Faces transmit memories and deliver places'<br /><br />  Quiddity.

A man \\"past his prime for wooing women, no longer the dashing rogue\\", Byron finds himself recently divorced and facing unemployment.  With typical wry humor, Byron wonders what a self-described \\"academic saddle tramp\\" will become without his position as a college English teacher in Pocatello.  He's<br /><br />accustomed to defining the boundaries of his world in solitary pursuits by listening to the blues, reading Hemingway or Keats or Rilke, enjoying Nature in the wild Idaho back country.  He's out of his element when a couple of his students lead him into a dangerous distraction.<br /><br />Ted Bear is a student activist determined to reveal illegal toxic dumping and stop white supremacist activities in the area.  Despite his initial reluctance, Byron finds himself drawn into conflicts between white supremacists, a suspicious red neck sheriff, drug dealers, the Mafia and the F.B.I.  To complicate his world, Byron is falling in love.  The quiet man<br /><br />and deep thinker who vowed to never fall in love again is making sweet music with Mary Goldstein -- an undercover F.B.I. agent -- in wild grasses on the Ft. Hall Reservation.  Mary brings a dangerous edge to their affair.  Soon he's up to his neck in an FBI investigation, tracking a marauding bear and<br /><br />having his life saved by a vengeful Indian Spirit Walker.  Despite his doubts about himself, Byron Duffy measures up.<br /><br />What sets Byron apart from other action thrillers is<br /><br />Corrigan's splendid use of descriptive prose.  Through his eyes and words the Idaho wilderness becomes a living character.  And the noir loneliness of Byron Duffy shines in a thousand different passages because Michael Corrigan knows how to tell a story:<br /><br />  \\"At the crossing, Byron watched the last train heading  toward Pocatello.  Trains always made him think of hoboes riding the rails, American isolation and loneliness celebrated by folk singers singing of poverty and lost love.  It was a world of unrequited love, revenge, murder and characters with names like Staggalee and Pretty Polly.  The train passed, light bringing up the brief images of trees and houses, the whistle coming back at him like a ghostly voice out of the darkness.  Byron thought he saw a lone figure standing in the trees, but then the train was gone and the landscape vanished into darkness.\\"singing of poverty and lost love.

This ninth book is an action thriller and every bit as good as his previous stories.<br /><br />Dr. John Jennings is a family practice physician who loves his<br /><br />work and his life.  Hatcher Creek Arkansas is a peaceful village, far removed from the traffic, noise, and polluted air of cities.  When Jennings and his family embark on their annual rough camping trip to a remote mountainous region not far from Hatcher Creek, the experience swiftly changes from idyllic recreation to danger. Jennings hikes to his favorite fishing lake in hopes of enjoying solitary time.  He's driven into unfamiliar territory by a storm and takes refuge in a cave that smells strongly of exhaust fumes.  Back at camp, his family sees an oil slick on a clear mountain stream.  In Dr. Jennings' absence, his wife and two young children are surrounded by men in military garb, blindfolded, and held hostage in an unknown location.  The campsite is swept clean.  An empty clearing<br /><br />greets Jennings on his return.  He has no choice but to retrace his path in hopes the cave will yield clues to his family's disappearance.<br /><br />When Jennings stumbles across the mountain home of Cordell Heartley, the odds of finding his missing family change to his favor.  Heartley is a reclusive ex-Army Ranger, an experienced spelunker and warrior whose survival skills prove helpful to the bewildered Jennings.  Using a natural underground cave system, they systematically track the smells of vehicle<br /><br />exhaust.  What they find is is shocking, a hidden military project underground where SUVs are transformed into bombs destined for Iraq.  Those involved are patriots of a different stripe than Heartley, playing a dangerous game without the knowledge of their government.  From that initial discovery the game becomes straight arrow Rangers vs. a few bad Army apples as the danger level increases exponentially with passing time.  Heartley's investigation takes him from Arkansas to New Orleans to Iraq as he calls in favors from old friends and military contacts to prevent the deaths of innocent civilians.  But the unprincipled predators hiding behind U.S. Army uniforms don't plan to give in without a fight.  They'll eliminate Heartley<br /><br />if they have to, or murder Jennings and his family if necessary to accomplish their illegal goals.<br /><br />The Threef Project is fast paced and exciting.  The plot is distinctive and definitely not a clone of every other action thriller out there.  Heartley is a true patriot in the finest sense of the word, and John Jennings is a courageous common citizen caught in a frightening maze.  This book is<br /><br />Foertmeyer's testament to the men of courage and honor -- both in and out of the military -- who love their country and do whatever it takes to protect it.tley's investigation takes him from Arkansas to New Orleans to Iraq as he calls in favors from old friends and military contacts to prevent the deaths of innocent civilians.

The project he's been working on for years could solve Earth's energy crisis, prolong human life, or extinguish life as we know it on this planet if it falls into the wrong hands.  His discoveries are worth trillions.  But Anderson is an idealist whose motives have nothing to do with money.  To prevent his discoveries<br /><br />from being tainted, he's been negotiating with Big Government and predatory CEOs.  Unscrupulous men at every level want Ben Anderson's knowledge and don't care who they have to kill to possess it.<br /><br />Ben Anderson is Haley Walther's adoptive father and mentor.  Haley is a brilliant scientist in her own right, unexpectedly fired from the Sanker Corporation where she and Ben both worked.  When Ben goes missing, the clues he leaves behind are cryptic and frightening.  Haley needs help circumventing security protocols at Sanker and, whether she likes it or not,<br /><br />Ben's nephew, Sam Wintripp, is the only man she can trust.  Sam and Haley have unresolved history between them, history that Sam believes is best forgotten.<br /><br />Sam Wintripp is recuperating from devastating injuries that left him physically weakened and emotionally drained.  He hopes the magnificent beauty and peaceful surroundings of the San Juan Islands will promote recovery and ease his physical and psychic pain.  Sam is determined to leave a career of killing and covert ops behind, but Haley needs him to locate Ben<br /><br />Anderson.  Sam can barely walk, and is no longer the focused operative he once was, but he protects Haley with what energy he has left as they fight to locate Ben.<br /><br />Everyone who cares about Ben Anderson is relentlessly hounded by a vicious retired cop named Frick.  Frick kills without compunction, because he enjoys maiming and murder.  He's pathologically power-mad and hungry for the wealth Ben's discoveries will deliver.  And nothing would please him more than to see Sam Wintripp and Haley Walther suffer a slow death at his hands.  He plays a grueling cat and mouse game with the exhausted Sam and terrorizes Haley.  Imported henchmen from Las Vegas assist Frick in his madness, but underestimate the combined skill and ability Sam and Haley bring to the chase.  Sam may not be the physically powerful superhero he once was, but he's cunning and intelligent.  And Haley is not the fragile female Frick imagines.  She's an accomplished sailor and pilot who knows the San Juan islands well, and she's not about to let Frick win.<br /><br />I read The Black Silent straight through because it was too exciting to put down.

And England's citizens have never quite recovered from World War I, including Maisie Dobbs.  She still struggles with her experiences as a nurse at the Front.  The man she loved in wartime is little more than a vegetable confined to a<br /><br />wheelchair.  And her mother's untimely death haunts Maisie's thoughts, asleep or awake.  Still, her work as an Investigator / Psychologist keeps her focused and busy as she pursues a cautious relationship with a devoted admirer, Dr. Andrew Dene.  Maisie Dobbs is plucky, determined, and has<br /><br />become a skillful investigator in her own right.  She'll need every ounce of courage and skill she possesses to survive the case that unexpectedly presents itself.<br /><br />Sir Cecil Lawton QC is a legal miracle worker and one of the great orators of his time.  He promises his wife on her death bed to search for proof of their son Ralph's death.  Sir Cecil hires Maisie to investigate the fiery airplane crash in France to prove Ralph dead.  In exchange, Maisie agrees to halve her fee if Sir Cecil will defend an innocent, imprisoned girl awaiting trial for murder.  While Maisie follows one intriguing lead after another in her search for evidence of Ralph Lawton's death, her assistant Billy Beale seeks information to bolster her belief that an innocent girl has been wrongly accused of murder.<br /><br />To complicate the investigation into Ralph Lawton's death, long time friend Priscilla begs Maisie to find information about her brother Peter.  Soon, Maisie's educated hunches and focused search for clues lead her to believe that the disappearance of both men is related.  After several attempts on her life, Maisie is convinced that someone powerful wishes to prevent a firm conclusion of her investigation.

Word Press is a publisher with a primary submission guideline of poetic excellence.  Radiance is the winner of the Word Press First Book Prize.  That prize is well-deserved.  Crookers beautiful poetry is easily understood, coming straight at readers from the heart and marrow.<br /><br />Her technique of occasionally continuing the poem from its title was new to me, and quite appealing.  A personal favorite is \\"Sometimes, I Am Startled Out of Myself,\\":<br /><br />  like this morning, when the wild geese came squawking,<br /><br />  flapping their rusty hinges, and something about their trek<br /><br />  across the sky made me think about my life, the places<br /><br />  of brokenness, the places of sorrow, the places where grief<br /><br />  has strung me out to dry......<br /><br />This poet skillfully creates magic out of the mundane.  Her<br /><br />poems often reflect a graceful blending of bitter and sweet, light and dark.  In evidence of that statement, I offer \\"White Lilacs, After a Painting by Eduoard Manet\\" in its entirety:<br /><br />  When the world<br /><br />  was reduced to a black flag<br /><br />  of pain, what else could he do<br /><br />  but paint flowers, white<br /><br />  lilacs in a crystal vase,<br /><br />  prismatic in the May sunlight,<br /><br />  their heavy perfume<br /><br />  filling the room?<br /><br />  And what can I do<br /><br />  when my autistic son<br /><br />  shuts down, talks nonsense,<br /><br />  flicks and stims?<br /><br />  I want to go out<br /><br />  and swim in this river<br /><br />  of drenching scent,<br /><br />  so thick you could lick it<br /><br />  from the air.  I'd like to shrink<br /><br />  to the size of a raindrop,<br /><br />  make my home on this branch<br /><br />  of white clusters, let the ether<br /><br />  of their odor anesthetize the evening,<br /><br />  a field of blank white snow.<br /><br />Crooker's world is one of impressionistic beauty, generously shared.  She gives us \\"bruise-blue irises that wince against the yellow wall\\" and \\"white blossoms, festive as brides.\\"  With her we hear \\"dogwoods sing loud hosannas\\" and \\"notes turned liquid in the autumn sun.\\"  Each word and every phrase is carefully combined for our pleasure or understanding of Crooker's world, much like the impressionist artists created paintings dot by precious dot.  Her poetry paints rich word canvases, glorious as an Old Master in his prime.and \\"white blossoms, festive as brides.\\"  With her we hear \\"dogwoods sing loud hosannas\\" and \\"notes turned liquid in the autumn sun.\\"  Each word and every phrase is carefully combined for our pleasure or understanding of Crooker's world, much like the impressionist artists created paintings dot by precious dot.

Yakov Azriel is an award winning poet who lives in Israel.  This first full length book is a shining example of why his tenderly crafted work wins awards.  As he leads readers step by step through the book of Genesis, God's words and covenants come to life in human form.  And yet, it isn't necessary<br /><br />that we be Jewish, Christian, or religious to appreciate Azriel's poetry.  His blending of modern day humanity with the ancient historical icons of Genesis is that skillful.<br /><br />Scriptures from Genesis introduce each poem, starting with the Creation and ending with Joseph's Coat of Many Colors.  Each poem, regardless of topic, melds the modern with the historical in insightful ways.  Consider, for example, this excerpt from \\"Questions for Eve\\":<br /><br />  Why did you talk to the serpent?<br /><br />  Don't you know that even then he was planning the gas chambers,<br /><br />  Blueprinting the crematoria?<br /><br />  How can a mother be so naieve?<br /><br />  Snakes devour<br /><br />  Dust, like the cinder<br /><br />  Of children belched from the chimneys.<br /><br />  Lucky you -- only one son will be murdered.<br /><br />Azriel uses various poetic forms, from formal rhyme to free verse to haunting metaphor as he shares the Song of Songs and the Generations of Jacob.  One of the most chilling works in this book, and ultimately the most glorious, is \\"As the Stars, As the Sand\\", based on God's promise to ancient Israel in Genesis 22:17:  \\"For I will surely bless you and surely multiply your seed, as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the sea-shore.\\"<br /><br />Threads From a Coat of Many Colors is a wistful paean, a universal spirit prayer carried on hot desert winds.  Azriel transports us to a time of miracles and promises, detailing a rich history we all share in one way or another.	2005-08-05

The press release accompanying this book of short stories states that Edward Falco has been quietly establishing himself  as master storyteller for years.  His stories have appeared in Atlantic Monthly and Playboy as well as prestigious anthologies.  His fans will relish  this collection.  Readers<br /><br />unfamiliar with his work, like me, will remember Edward Falco's name from now on.<br /><br />Each one of the sixteen stories in this collection is distinct.  Falco gives us mysteries, unexpected salvations or revelations, and forces us to examine the sacred and profane with fresh eyes.  His plots are gripping, woven from threads familiar to us all: dysfuntional families that somehow work; people who wear their human vulnerabilities like a badge of honor as they flounder; lives derailed or hopelessly wrecked by choice or circumstance; hapless mortals forced to deal with the unthinkable and horrible; and unacceptable but inevitable compromises made amidst chaos.  Characters vary, from<br /><br />peaceful people just trying to survive, to teenagers struggling to find their own identity, to dangerous or pathetic human animals at heart. Regardless of the milieu in which the author places them, each character is solid and memorable.<br /><br />Falco reveals the rage and fear that often trembles hidden at our core. His prose is alternately haunting and tender, comforting and disturbing. Edward Falco's writing beautifully explores the lights and shadows of human existence.	2005-07-11

Full of bright colors and positive messages, A.D.D. and Me is appropriate<br /><br />for all ages, including small children.  This book is more than simply helpful and informative.  It's a success story blueprint for anyone who reads it.  A portion of the proceeds will go to C.H.A.D.D.<br /><br />In 1976, Travis Hall was born into a loving, nurturing family.  As Travis grew, he had difficulty concentrating, completing tasks, and interacting effectively with others.  Concerned teachers wondered why he couldn't remember instructions or \\"settle down\\" and pay attention.  Travis struggled due to his confusion and anger at needing constant reminders to complete simple, everyday tasks.<br /><br />His parents soon learned to accentuate the positive accomplishments instead of dwelling on the negative behaviors.  Travis is wonderfully gifted in many ways.  His colorful drawings recreated in this book are proof of that.  He is a handsome, physically healthy, and intelligent boy.  Over time, Ms. Hall built on Travis' strong points with positive messages.  The Halls also learned that hereditary traits often are a cause of A.D.D.  With patience, understanding, and encouragement the adults in his life eased Travis towards<br /><br />adulthood.<br /><br />Any parent, relative, teacher, counselor, psychologist, or child dealing with A.D.D. will benefit from this book.  I will repeat that this book is beautiful, helpful, and wise, written from Travis Hall's point of view.  When I called A.D.D. and Me a blueprint for success, I was not exaggerating.  Travis Hall is a winner in every way.  Highly recommended for all age groups.	2005-07-03

We suffer grief and loss when a pet dies, much the same as when a human dies.  The author understands such grief.  With this book based solidly on Bible scriptures, she offers hope and reassurance to pet lovers everywhere.<br /><br />Do animals go to heaven when they die?  Those who believe the Bible will know for certain that they do, once they've read this book.  God ordered humans to be stewards of all creation, including animals.  Our lives would lack joy and happiness without them.  And yet, animals share man's fate.  They suffer and eventually die no matter how much we love them.  Step by<br /><br />step, through well researched and referenced scriptures, Ms. Shanahan proves that animals have soul, spirit, and are valued by God the same as humans.  And she does not simply quote Bible verses to make her point.  She compares the meanings of words in the original Hebrew and Greek texts for added<br /><br />emphasis.  I found this technique particularly helpful.<br /><br />The Disciple John says in Revelation 5:13, after experiencing a vision of Heaven, \\"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb forever and ever.\\"  John heard every<br /><br />creature, man and beast, praising God and Jesus in heaven.  And this is just one of many such scriptures proving our animal companions share the human cycle of life, death, and resurrection.<br /><br />There is Eternal Life for Animals is a helpful, hopeful, uplifting book.  I recommend it to everyone who loves animals and wonders what happens when a pet dies.	2005-07-03

This second in the Jack Daniels series is a top notch read from first page to last.  The characters are deliciously human, the dialogue and graphic details realistic, and Konrath tops it off with a rousing plot. I couldn't turn these pages fast enough!<br /><br />Lt. Jacqueline Daniels -- better known as Jack to her friends -- heads Chicago P.D.'s Violent Crimes Unit.  She's forty-something, divorced, and not exactly living la dolce vita.  Jack's life is in turmoil. She has a boyfriend who just may be the last good marriage prospect in the midwest.  He wants Jack to move in with him.  Complicating that romantic scenario are<br /><br />a retired-cop mother needing full time care and an ex-husband who's decided he can't live without Jack.  Lt. Daniels is a damn good cop, a hard nosed detective whose personal problems sometimes skew her concentration.  Her partner, junk food afficionado Herb Benedict, brings problems of his own to<br /><br />the office.  He wants to lose weight and liven up his long term marriage with Viagra.  The last thing these two partners need is a serial killer run amok in the Windy City.<br /><br />Their suspect is a maniacal butcher with the conscience and killing instincts of a shark.  He's a madman who blends into daily life invisibly thanks to a facade of normalcy.  Halfway through the book we discover who this killer is, but that certainly does not detract from the suspense.  Through one sizzling Chicago summer through most of a bitterly cold winter,<br /><br />Jack and Herb track down one disappointing lead after another.  Meanwhile, the body count rises.  Each butchered corpse is wearing some article that belongs to Jack.  And each murder brings a demented killer closer to Jack's front door.<br /><br />I like J.A. Konrath's writing style.  He combines grisly crime, solid police work, and forensics with appealing humor to build suspense in satisfying ways.  Fans of the genre will do well to discover Konrath.  And they certainly will find an intriguing mystery in Bloody Mary.uing mystery in Bloody Mary.    <br /> <br />	2005-07-03

It is on this scripture that Ms. Shanahan builds the framework of Animal Prayer Guide. Using scriptures as her guide, along with heartwarming stories and photos, the author takes us step by step through daily life with our animal companions.  Animals share our world.  They breathe the same air we breathe.  Animals suffer and die as humans do, and are resurrected into<br /><br />Heaven as we are.  It stands to reason then that the same prayers spoken for humans should be prayed for animals.<br /><br />The author makes her case for animals beautifully through God's Word.  She also shares stories of miracle healings and angelic protection related to animals.  For the readers' convenience, model prayers are offered for a variety of needs including:<br /><br />  praying over our pets' food and water;<br /><br />  praying for healing, protection, and emergencies;<br /><br />  annointing with oil;<br /><br />  a pet memorial service.<br /><br />Most of us grieve over the loss of a pet as much or sometimes more than the loss of a human friend because animals love as God loves, unconditionally. The Animal Prayer Guide offers hope and comfort to all readers who love and care about their pets.  This quote from St. Francis of Assisi sums up this book perfectly:  \\"If you have men who will exclude any of God's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men.\\"<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for people who love and care about their animal companions.	2005-06-30

They live in a cozy Brooklyn neighborhood of tidy brownstones, shade trees, flower gardens and well kept parks.  Folks can walk from place to place, visiting small businesses and eateries without fear.

Life is good, until a horror none of them could possibly imagine wrecks their comfortable world.<br /><br />When Lauren fails to meet Alice in the park or pick up her son from school, Maggie and Alice are excited.  They just know Lauren has gone into labor.  Excitement soon gives way to dread when Lauren can't be found in area hospitals.  One day passes, then two and three with no word from their friend.  Where could an almost nine month pregnant woman be?  Maggie and<br /><br />Alice are on hand when Lauren's decomposing body is pulled from a nearby canal.  Her baby has been surgically removed through an amateurish incision in Lauren's abdomen.  The sight of her friend's dead body and the missing baby haunts Alice.  Who would kill a mother in plain sight and take her baby?  And why?<br /><br />Alice imagines a seedy stranger is following her.  She fears for her unborn twins.  That fear is shared by detectives with the Brooklyn Police Department because Lauren is not the first pregnant woman to die in such a way.  Clues are few and far between.  Soon no one is safe from harm, not even Alice's realtor, as a vicious killer stalks them all.

This is Alessio Zanelli's first book of poetry, published initially by Minerva Press UK and then released as a second edition by Upfront Publishing UK.  Since publication of Loose Sheets, his poetry has been featured in many journals throughout the US, UK, and Europe.  Zanelli has the distinction of being an Italian poet who writes and creates in English.  His work is an intriguing mix of metaphorical visions and structured lyricism.<br /><br />Consider, for example, this excerpt from \\"Before That Night Comes\\", where Zanelli contemplates the advent of Christmas:<br /><br />  Impalpable, a snowdust<br /><br />  Pauses in the air,<br /><br />  Reminding hearts in anxiety<br /><br />  Of the coming of a Holy Night.<br /><br />  Imperceptible, it spreads<br /><br />  A rare happiness,<br /><br />  Inebriating, an aura<br /><br />  Among the souls of amazed men.<br /><br />\\"The Scream of the Deep\\" is one example of how this poet views the strengths and weaknesses of man.  Human interaction can be both sweet and bitter, blind and enlightened:<br /><br />  Blind eyes<br /><br />  Don't see the wonderments of earth,<br /><br />  Yet admire the horrors.<br /><br />  Delighted ears filled with a robin's chirp<br /><br />  Are deaf<br /><br />  To the scream of the deep.<br /><br />Zanelli's contemplations of love and loss are alternately tender and painful. These two excerpts from \\"In Your Place\\" illustrate my point:<br /><br />  There must be a place<br /><br />  Where I can plunge my face<br /><br />  Which be neither my lean hands<br /><br />  Nor your throbbing breast:<br /><br />  *  *  *  *<br /><br />  There then -- as invisble wires<br /><br />  Binding us in one tight knot --<br /><br />  Tunes will breathe between us...<br /><br />Alessio Zanelli records life with the heart and spirit of those classic poets from past times.  He weaves with appealing effect the real into the metaphorical, and the visionary.	2005-06-18

This is Rachel Dayvault's first novel.  Those who have the good fortune of reading it will hope it isn't her last.  Dayvault definitely has a way with words and tells a captivating story.  The characters are realistic, the dialogue true to life, and the prose often beautiful.<br /><br />In the imaginative prologue we meet Maralee who is contemplating actions no friend should have to face.  Her life long friend Julia has perished in the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Building.  Almost simultaneously, the love of Julia's life dies in an Arizona plane crash.  Tales of heroism and thrilling acts of kindness on the news can't reach Maralee's heart.  Her heart is broken from Julia's loss.  Somehow she must bring the ashes of Julia and her lover together in death as they were in life.  But how?<br /><br />Knowing that both main characters have died does not detract from the story.  It strengthens and enriches each chapter and every moment.  Julia Hollander is a woman with a strong moral compass and an adventuresome spirit.  She's endured an inattentive husband and a dead marriage for years.  Now her husband is in a nursing home, slowly deteriorating from Alzheimer's.  Despite the protests of her grown children, she and friend Maralee book a tour of Italy.<br /><br />Austin Randolph is a fifty-something widower.  His marriage to an alcoholic, manipulative woman left deep wounds.  A cautious, solemn man, he's always been the rock to his three children.  He finds great peace in travel, reading guidebooks and brochures to occupy his thoughts.  When he meets Julia in Italy, every hope and dream he ever had regarding love and travel is epitomized in her beauty and vivacious personality.  With Julia he can laugh and be himself without fear of reprisal.<br /><br />Both in their fifties, Julia and Austin are no longer young.  Each has learned to consider life's risks and avoid pain.  In lengthy conversations, they share their love of travel and especially enjoy exploring quaint villages.  In a few short days of sight seeing, they fall in love.  Their time in Italy is idyllic.  Nothing is out of bounds -- not their deepest fears or secret dreams -- as each allows the other into their world.  Such intimacies give them hope as Julia contemplates divorce from her husband and marriage to Austin.<br /><br />Stateside, the aging lovers struggle to maintain the joy they knew in Italy.  Vitriolic in-laws shatter Julia's joy, while Austin fights a deep depression caused by his children.  They meet occasionally and manage to reconfirm their devotion or to resolve family differences.  But eventually they decide to marry and throw caution to the wind, regardless of what their families might think.<br /><br />What sets this book apart for me is the descriptive prose.  Austin and Julia don't simply travel, talk, and make love.  They generously share the world they see around them.  The following is one small sample:<br /><br />\\"Late afternoon shadows etched depth and contrast into the rustic stone walls and hid dusty lanes behind rows of yellowing saplings.

I don't agree with the earlier review here that says this book is not exceptional.  However, the beauty of poetry is that everyone sees what the poet intended through different eyes. One critic described R.T. Smith's poetry as \\"...language played by a virtuoso.\\"  Wish I'd been the one to say it first, but I just recently discovered Smith's work and decided to begin my exploration with Tresspasser. This book is beautiful and haunting, mysterious as runic stones and Celtic petroglyphs. Smith shares Ireland's essence through his words and takes<br /><br />readers with him on the journey.<br /><br />In \\"Waterford\\", for example, he regards a crystal pitcher and longs for the:<br /><br />  ...clarity of this Irish<br /><br />  vessel, fragile and dazzling<br /><br />  in my trespassing hands.<br /><br />\\"Leabai\\" is one mortal's lyrical penitence as he searches for the lost, beautifully expressed in this excerpt:<br /><br />  ...and I climbed over hare<br /><br />  terraces and stiles to reach<br /><br />  this place by twilight,<br /><br />  to touch the high crosses<br /><br />  and lie on pocked limestone,<br /><br />  to ask for secrets the clover<br /><br />  keeps, answers deep in bone<br /><br />  and crozier, a red-letter<br /><br />  Gospel gone to dust...<br /><br />  ...I was riding<br /><br />  the swell and luster to the ruins<br /><br />  of a language, walls and hedges<br /><br />  honeycombing the limestone in obsolete<br /><br />  syntax, but the sea's pitch and wind<br /><br />  said grief is the only dialect that<br /><br />  endures...<br /><br />In \\"Angels\\", swallows are transformed by their grace and the poet's imagination:<br /><br />  ...Backlit<br /><br />  to dazzlement by afternoon<br /><br />  sunlight, they embroider<br /><br />  the air...<br /><br />And in \\"Sect\\", Smith visits a Shaker village and discovers troubling truths about himself while contemplating their lifestyle:<br /><br />  ...is it the wind from junipers<br /><br />  and changing maples<br /><br />  or my own heart's edge<br /><br />  that makes me look back and shiver so?<br /><br />  I too have devoted too much to order,<br /><br />  the immaculate and severe.<br /><br />If one can have a favorite in such a fine array of poems, mine was \\"The Hard Word.\\"  To me it was the epitome of what makes Smith's work shine.

The author's father came to America in 1906 from Sicily as a youth.  Arrival on Ellis Island was both exciting and confusing for immigrants seeking hope in a new homeland.  They faced rigorous mental and physical examinations.  Many, like Pellegrino Angelo, spoke no English.  But once they passed all<br /><br />examinations and passed through the door of Ellis Island to the world beyond, the hope of new beginnings awaited them.  Many immigrants kissed that door with joy and relief.  Beyond the Kissing Door is the true story of one Sicilian immigrant and his descendents.<br /><br />Pellegrino Angelo was a man of the \\"old world.\\"  Life in Sicily had been hard but making a go of it in America was harder.  He had no education or special training, had little comprehension of mechanization.  But Pellegrino proceeded with determination to become a productive citizen.  His arranged marriage with the teenage Mary proved to be the roots that would anchor his new life.  Pellegrino and Mary Angelo had no expectations of grandeur or wealth.  Their focus was raising, feeding, and clothing nine children.  Rosy Latur is one of those nine children.<br /><br />The author's memories of life in the Angelo household are bittersweet.  As an adult, riding a train to Pellegrino's funeral, Ms. Latur revisits her life growing up as Pellegrino's daughter.  Her father was a man of many facets, not all of them loveable in her opinion.  As a child, she saw him as a \\"raggedy man\\" who wore shabby clothes and wore a rope around his waist to hold his pants up.  On one hand, he was a penny pincher who rarely spent his hard earned money on anything but sheer necessities.  But he was also a man who sang with joy, who gave generously of his garden produce to those in need.  Despite his lack of education, he was a man of native intelligence and pride, capable of accomplishing anything he set his mind<br /><br />to. As the train heads towards her parents' home in Illinois, Latur weighs the essence of the man who was her father and regrets her attitudes towards him in youth.<br /><br />Rosy Latur could be the voice for every child raised by immigrant parents in America.  Her memories are sweet and sad as she documents the life of Pellegrino and Mary Angelo.  As a fitting climax to their story, readers accompany the author and her daughter as they make a pilgrimage to Italy and Sicily to view Pellegrino's homeland with their own eyes.<br /><br />Beyond the Kissing Door is uplifting and informative.

An is a native of Holland, married to a Mennonite pastor for more than sixty years.  Lynn is from Minnesota, now living and working in Amsterdam.  They meet through fate and these amazing women gradually share their stories.  Passing on the Comfort takes us back through time to an era of quiet courage, when an oppressed people found fleeting moments of warmth and comfort wrapped in quilts provided them by strangers.  It seems a simple premise, but this story blossoms through the wonder of these quilts and the<br /><br />skillful weaving of two lives.<br /><br />An is 23 in 1944, an inexperienced girl working with the Dutch Resistance during World War Two.  The Nazi Occupation of her homeland changes life for everyone.  Families are separated.  Food, once so abundant, is scarce.  Collaborators who were previously friends or neighbors lurk in every town and village.  When An marries Herman, a Mennonite pastor, their<br /><br />home becomes a way station for starving children, Jews fleeing for their lives, and vermin infested Resistance fighters.  Throughout the Occupation and after the war, the Mennonite Central Committee of North America provides food, personal items, clothing, and quilts to the people of Holland.  An shares this history of wartime Occupation simply.  The telling is poignant and powerful.<br /><br />In 1972 a youthful Lynn meets her future husband in Holland<br /><br />while searching for meaning in a troubled world.  She's a peace activist befriended by a group of Palestinian men and European women.  Among those men is Avo.  Lynn finds love and a new home in Amsterdam.  On a trip in 1980, Lynn meets An and sees her collection of quilts received during the war.  As their friendship grows through correspondence, Lynn asks to show<br /><br />the quilts at her bookstore.<br /><br />This story is a fascinating view of history, a view few readers will remember.  Throughout millennia, the Dutch have helped oppressed countries without fanfare.  They helped because they could.  In World War Two that help was returned to them during the Occupation in many great and small ways.  It's through the quilts that An preserves her memories of the war years.  Worn by time and use, family quilts donated by the women who made<br /><br />them, their faded beauty reflects history and represents generosity at its finest.  They bear silent witness to a place and time we should not forget.<br /><br />Nineteen quilts are featured in this beautiful book, reproduced in vibrant color on glossy pages.  Everything about this book is beautiful, in fact, from the women who wrote it to the words they wrote to the quilts they both hold dear.  Mennonite readers will take pride in their heritage.  History buffs will love every part of this story.  To all, of any age,<br /><br />Passing on the Comfort is highly recommended.millennia, the Dutch have helped oppressed countries without fanfare.

Ron Callari and Jack Pittman describe themselves as \\"two '60s sympathizers who have traded in their peace signs for Florsheims but still want to give peace a chance.\\"  Callari writes the commentary and Pittman creates the illustrations.  Together, thanks to their fertile imaginations, they take political commentary, irony and satire to new heights.  The star of their joint effort is Kidd Millennium, a sly, wisecracking, bediapered baby who delivers \\"platitudes with attitude.\\"  Callari, Pittman, and Kidd have a devoted international following and it's no wonder.  But I suspect the politicians skewered by this feisty Kidd and his pals are less than thrilled by Callari and Pittman's war of words and images.  If this book does not make you smile or make you mad, or both, nothing will.<br /><br />Both commentary and illustrations are excellent so I had trouble choosing review content.  A few of the highlights for me included the following commentaries:<br /><br />· the electoral college -- where party cronies elect the president and not the voters;<br /><br />· continuity of government -- better known in the beltway as the Shadow Government -- where only Republican members of the Executive Branch are allowed to survive to govern in a post-apocalyptic America;<br /><br />· zealots in training -- whose families are paid because their loved one agrees to martyr himself or herself in the name of jihad and Allah;<br /><br />· strange bedfellows -- the evildoers who are anathema today are the \\"informers\\" the U.S. paid handsomely for information and favors yesterday.<br /><br />All the illustrations were equally thought provoking, but among my favorites were:<br /><br />· a parody of Men in Black, with the President wiping out our collective memories of past missteps, with the kidd asking \\"How do you think he's maintained his popularity rating?\\";<br /><br />· the President reprising Swarzenegger's role as the Terminator, starring as \\"the Preemptinator\\".  The critics gave this debut two big thumbs up, but as Kidd Millennium astutely pointed out, they did not say up where;<br /><br />· a poignant and powerful illustration of Kidd Millennium comforting a weeping Statue of Liberty after 9/11;<br /><br />· the President in an Iraqi foxhole asking \\"Is it still a standoff?\\" with Kidd as his lookout saying, \\"No.  Rumsfeld has successfully transferred his high level blame to low level prison guards.\\"<br /><br />Most of us already know our government plays fast and loose with taxpayer money.  It also comes as no big surprise that we are shut out of the decision-making loops and circles in D.C.  Despite that, Callari and Pittman shed new light on the Iraqi war while educating and entertaining.  Sun Tzu, as the originator of \\"shock and awe,\\" said several thousand years ago that the best way to win a battle was not to fight it.  In Uncle Dubya's Jihad Jamboree, Callari and Pittman wonder how we got that message wrong, and question all the many reasons why.bs up, but as Kidd Millennium astutely pointed out, they did not say up where; <br /> a poignant and powerful illustration of Kidd Millennium comforting a weeping Statue of Liberty after 9/11; <br /> the President in an Iraqi foxhole asking \\"Is it still a standoff?\\" with Kidd as his lookout saying, \\"No.  Rumsfeld has successfully transferred his high level blame to low level prison guards.\\" <br /> <br />Most of us already know our government plays fast and loose with taxpayer money.

This author does a remarkable job of illustrating that point as he tells the story of one family.  But Passing the Baton goes far beyond being simply a memoir.<br /><br />Jerry Rekned, as family friend and witness to their lives, shares the Hirsch family story in first person.  The author, through Jerry, is an extraordinary story teller.  His intimate recollections of life in Brooklyn during the first fifty years of the 20th century draw readers into the story immediately.  Each generation of Hirschs come alive in many large and small ways.  The effect is touching, humorous, sad, delightful, and real.<br /><br />Joe Hirsch's ancestors came to America from czarist Russia to escape religious persecution.  As Russian Jews, even initial poverty in Brooklyn was preferable to the brutal pogroms experienced in their homeland.  Despite racial, religious, and ethnic segregation, the Hirsch family grew and thrived in their new land.<br /><br />Norman \\"Joe\\" Hirsch is the amazing central character of this story.  As a boy he is the likeable, sensible, athletic and self reliant hero to his younger brother Billy.  Joe, Billy, and friends grow up in Brooklyn during the 20s and 30s.  Through them we get a close up view of what life was like for them day to day.  And through older members of the family we experience the socio-political climate of early 20th century America, and their concerns about yet another war festering in Europe.<br /><br />Joe and Billy Hirsch both enlist in 1942.  Like most American boys of the time, they hold an innocent, idealistic world view. For certain, none of them could imagine the horrors they would see in battle.  Through letters home, Jerry's commentary as related through family members, and Joe's diary entries, we see what they saw.  Basic training, flight school, and realistic accounts of bombing runs under heavy fire are harrowing.  Through their words, we live the war with them, feel the fear and experience the sorrow of losing comrades in foreign lands.  When Lt. Joe Hirsch is shot down with his crew over Germany in 1944, he is only 21 years old.  We grieve with his family and friends, feel that loss as surely as if he were one of our own.  But the war does end, and the baton of hope is passed to a new generation of Hirschs by story's end.<br /><br />Passing the Baton is more than a memoir, more than just a charming, well written book.  It's living history, rich and alive on every page.  My compliments to the author for a book exceedingly well written, entertaining, and educational.  This book gets my highest recommendation.rrowing.  Through their words, we live the war with them, feel the fear and experience the sorrow of losing comrades in foreign lands.  When Lt.

Early reviews of this book extol David Ray's poetry.  Among the accolades are:  \\"relentlessly devastating\\"; \\"the master work\\";  \\"a visionary blessing\\"; and \\"exquisitely beautiful.\\"  The Death of Sardanapalus goes far beyond those words of praise.  From the breathtaking cover and art work to David Ray's words, the entire presentation is of the highest quality.  As a reviewer, I must struggle to do this fine work justice.<br /><br />From ancient times, when Persians, Greeks, and Romans plagued the world with wars, poetic voices have  been raised in protest.  It requires as much courage to protest as it does to take up arms.  Through the ages, dissenters have been shunned, persecuted, or killed in an attempt to silence them.  Each war to end all war is made to seem heroic and patriotic by those in power at the time.  David Ray looks to past wars and long dead civilizations, drawing disturbing correlations to the powers waging war today.  He does not spare himself or readers the lingering sorrow and horror of 9/11.  Nor does he sidestep the sticky politics involved with the Iraqui wars. You'll find no politically correct drivel here.  This poet shines a penetrating light on smokescreens and enlightens as he educates.  It shocked me to comprehend, for example, that what our political powers call \\"collateral damage\\" today was labeled ethnic cleansing in the days of Hitler and Stalin:<br /><br />  Although I know it is naive, perverse, and infantile,<br /><br />  I cannot stop thinking of the children of Baghdad<br /><br />  who will soon be dealt with as if they are no more<br /><br />  than dust of the street, clay figurines to be shattered.<br /><br />The crux of our present deterioration within America's boundaries can be boiled down to its  essence in one poem, titled \\"Congress\\":<br /><br />  A few good women<br /><br />  spoke up<br /><br />  and a few good men.<br /><br />  The others voted<br /><br />  Gung-ho for war.<br /><br />  And then gave more<br /><br />  billions every time<br /><br />  they were asked although<br /><br />  we cannot afford<br /><br />  such luxuries as<br /><br />  health care, clean air,<br /><br />  or voting machines<br /><br />  that will guarantee<br /><br />  an honest election --<br /><br />  the last thing desired<br /><br />  in our unique democracy.<br /><br />Weapons of mass destruction haunt our world and this poet's thoughts.  Americans watch the news for warning signs that air or water have been targeted by terrorists.  Meanwhile, in \\"WMDS Anew\\", David Ray presents a view that many of us may have missed:<br /><br />  On the freight siding<br /><br />  the cars of DuPont and Dow<br /><br />  stand ready to serve.<br /><br />Tax paying citizens, going about their daily lives, have responsibilities too.  Regrettably, America lost her innocence long before 9/11.  Ray makes that clear in this excerpt from \\"A Vision Emergency:<br /><br />  .....Peasants are fleeing<br /><br />  our planes, and we who fund a war<br /><br />  machine, even the gentlest among us,<br /><br />  are no longer the good people even<br /><br />  in our own eyes.  Fear gathers around<br /><br />  towns and cities all over the earth<br /><br />  and we are what is feared, as Rome<br /><br />  once was.....<br /><br />It's been said that poetry is man's way of expressing the inexpressible.  In The Death of Sardanapalus, David Ray weaves the inexpressible into every word, each poem, clearly and without the usual disguises.  His work is shocking, thought provoking and sad because he has not given up on hope.  Not entirely.  He still hopes poetry can make a difference.<br /><br />  We looked forward to a clean millennium,<br /><br />  free of murder.  But imagine our naievete!<br /><br />  Yet I praise our futile efforts, our going down<br /><br />  with our words the way soldiers fall in battles.<br /><br />My compliments to David Ray and Howling Dog Press for this amazing book.  If there is any justice left in the world,it will be a modern classic.rts, our going down <br />          with our words the way soldiers fall in battles. <br />  <br />My compliments to David Ray and Howling Dog Press for this amazing book.

David Rehak's novels are compelling, sometimes shocking, and always written in his own distinct voice.  His work is often daring, skating along the edges of familiar literary concepts.  This book of confessional prose poetry comes from the same place in Rehak's psyche.  Nothing is too sacred or profane to be an object of his Muse.  Whether rhyme, free verse, or prosaic processes, his poems run the gamut from sweet to solemn, erotic to irreverent, laced with generous doses of humor.<br /><br />\\"On the Death of a Friend\\" was one of my favorites because of its offset rhyming words and the sound of it when read aloud:<br /><br />  Death has coiled you round him too soon<br /><br />  In arms as dark as the hours of the moon,<br /><br />  In his soft, oblivious,<br /><br />  cozy cocoon,<br /><br />  Just to prove that flesh is never impervious.<br /><br />\\"Deceitful Age\\" is another favorite because of the different spin and varying poetic styles Rehak uses to make his point:<br /><br />  In this deceitful age,<br /><br />  Even liars elude shame;<br /><br />  And where is the public outrage<br /><br />  When the wrongdoer escapes blame?<br /><br />  Political leaders, you are failed saviors!<br /><br />  Political analysts, you are gloom-and-doom prophets!<br /><br />  Citizens, you are gullible victims!<br /><br />  And the world keeps spinning on its axis,<br /><br />  And Time keeps on ticking in the brain of its clock.<br /><br />\\"A Noble Savage\\" is this poet's contemplation on the novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley:<br /><br />  O noble savage<br /><br />  Of a twisted science!<br /><br />  You remind us of dangers<br /><br />  Like genetic engineering;<br /><br />  When man tampers with nature,<br /><br />  He pays an unaffordable price!<br /><br />Rehak's thoughts are often morbid as he contemplates his death or the death of others.  Sometimes he finds a disconcerting humor in the misbegotten misfits of a hypocritical society.  And every so often lovers of poetic metaphor will be delighted, as in this excerpt from \\"At the Beaches of Normandy\\":<br /><br />  as soon as we hit soil, the bullets hit us,<br /><br />  we were like wasps in the winter<br /><br />  of this furious flurry of fire.<br /><br />Or in this excerpt from \\"Autumn Rain\\":<br /><br />  And branches fearfully waved<br /><br />  Their every red-clad hand<br /><br />  Under teary-eyed clouds<br /><br />  And the pounding fist of thunder.<br /><br />David Rehak takes readers on a whirlwind tour of his world in Poems From My Bleeding Heart.

Critics have compared his writing style to le Carre, Greene, and Orwell, but I found Kanon's prose to be more provocative and accessible.<br /><br />Adam Miller is weary of his work.  As a U.S. Army war crimes investigator in post war Germany, he's systematically separated the truly evil Nazis from citizens who merely closed their eyes to fanaticism gone beyond their control.  When his tour of duty ends in 1946, Adam visits his widowed mother in Venice.  She has returned to familiar surroundings in hopes of being happy again.  Venice initially appears to be untouched by the war, but destruction takes many forms.  Bombed out buildings are not always the worst aftermath of war.<br /><br />At first, Adam is at loose ends.  Memories of death camps leave him sleepless and disoriented.  He wanders the canals and alleyways in hopes the city's beauty will provide solace or at least energize his spirit.  His mother is engaged to Dr. Gianni Maglione, a betrothal he suspects is for her money.  Old family friend Bertie Howard practices a forced gaiety, which Adam finds improbable.  A wintry Venice with its cold rains and creeping fogs depresses Adam, until he meets Claudia Grassini.  Making love in secret, seedy hideaways brings delight at first, a fleeting comfort as awful truths unravel.  Wherever Adam turns, nothing is as it appears to be.<br /><br />People do things to survive they wouldn't consider under normal circumstances.  They bend, ignore, pretend.  And no one has perfected the art of surviving better than those who live in Venice.  Adam suspects Dr. Maglione may be more than a fortune hunter.  He may be a Nazi sympathizer, or worse.  And Claudia has her own secrets to protect.  One unexpected act of violence smothers passion until remaining lovers becomes nothing more than an airtight alibi for Claudia and Adam.<br /><br />Kanon's writing style is personable and seductive.  His characters are real and human, fully developed.  Venice becomes a living entity and the winter weather a chilling accomplice to tragedy because Joseph Kanon is a skillful wordsmith.  Established fans will enthusiastically embrace Alibi.  Readers not familiar with Kanon's work should be converted rapidly to devotees.characters are real and human, fully developed.

People die mysteriously.  Paranoia and hallucinations twist the mundane into knots.  Pynchon pulls the reader's leg with his genius, provokes thought processes beyond the superficial.  He does it gradually and sneakily -- with prose that varies from beautifully wrought to exasperating, characters named Mucho Maas and Fallopian, a radio station named KCUF, and more outrageous plot twists than mind can comprehend -- until I did not know whether to gasp, laugh, or cry by the last page.	2005-03-25

His gift for detail is unerring, which makes this complex mystery all the more appealing.  Simply stated, I could not easily lay this book aside until the last page.<br /><br />The place is post World War One Berlin.  Rabb brings this metropolis to life with deft touches, shedding light in each dark corner, every nuance that gave Berlin its flavor at the time.  Rabb doesn't simply tell the wonderful and gritty details.  He takes his readers there so we can live it, experience the snow and mist, explore the scents and sounds.  His skill with descriptive prose adds resonating depths his readers might not have experienced otherwise.<br /><br />Detective Inspector of the Kriminal Polizei -- the Kripo -- Nikolei Hoffner, is in pursuit of a serial killer whose madness borders on genius.  Hoffner and his assistant, Hans Fichte, methodically follow every small clue, groping in the dark, until they find Rosa's body.  Rosa Luxemburg is a socialist revolutionary and enemy of the Reichstadt.  Hoffner knows immediately that, as a victim, she is out of place.  That initial thought draws Hoffner and Fichte into a provocative conspiracy involving the Political Police, the black market, secret Aryan societies, and scientific developments overseen by a young Albert Einstein.<br /><br />Nikolei Hoffner is a magnificent character, a troubled and brilliant man who seeks the truth with dogged determination.  We walk in Hoffner's shoes as he dissects cryptic clues and searches Berlin's underbelly for his killer.  The truths he uncovers and losses he experiences are horrible, beyond even his comprehension.<br /><br />Rabb totally immerses readers in place and time and his character development is brilliant.  We experience what Hoffner sees and feels, even his despair and impotence.  And we witness the horrifying stirrings of anti Semitism, glimpse the spectre that will be Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Jonathan Rabb blends history with fiction in Rosa with exciting results.  Rosa Luxemburg was real, as were many characters from that time.  Her murder and disappearance of her body were never solved in real life.  This book is one possible explanation.

Foertmeyer is the award nominated author of seven previous books in the fantasy genre.  Fans will find no time travel, shape shifting Native Americans, or other fantasy storylines in Bewildered.  What readers will experience is a nifty suspense thriller, a reality based adventure with cunning twists and turns of plot that will keep you guessing until the end.<br /><br />Annie and Charlie McVee plan to hike two hundred miles of the Appalachian Trail as a tenth anniversary gift to themselves.  Never one to stick with the ordinary, Charlie plots a hike offtrail, in uncharted territory.  Annie is uneasy when they discover impassable cliffs, then a small 18th century town with no inhabitants in sight.  They decide to return to the trail, which takes them on a grueling experience that turns deadly when their GPS is damaged in a fall.  Charlie wakes up in the Harlon County Tennessee hospital with two broken legs and a fractured hip.  The hospital is staffed by one doctor and one nurse, and the facts don't match up with what Charlie remembers.  He's told Annie died in a fall.  After six weeks of recuperation, he returns to their home in Cincinnati to resume life without Annie.  He's transported home by Michael McClellan, a resident of the tiny town they ran across while hiking.  The town is Jessup, a Puralist community of people who do not believe in modern technology or violence.<br /><br />After several weeks at home to think about his experience, Charlie discovers chilling truths.  His family doctor says x-rays show no sign of badly fractured legs or hip.  No medical bills have been sent or insurance claims filed for his six weeks in the hospital.  And the hospital, town, and county where he recuperated do not exist on any map or record.  He enlists a long time friend to accompany him back to Tennesee in search of answers.<br /><br />Dr. John Roberts joined the Jessup community five years prior to Charlie's accident.  He masquerades as a Puralist, who practice pure motives, when in truth he is after gold rumored to be buried nearby Jessup.  He's developed an elaborate series of lies to throw Charlie off the truth and convinced the Puralists to go along.  Roberts' sanity hangs by a thread as he bides his time anticipating a life of wealth with contraband gold.  He definitely does not live by the Puralist philsophy of non violence and is prepared to kill everyone who interferes with his plans.  People die.  Horrible lies are concocted.  And in the end, no one will be the same -- not Charlie, and certainly not the shy Puralists whose way of life is changed forever.<br /><br />Bewildered features appealing characters and wild Appalachian terrain in an exciting storyline.

Each of his four books is different, however, and Spirit of Rebellion is exceptional for the addition of prose. The stream of consciousness prose in \\"It was a Long and Lonely Night\\" was first rate. But as always, it is his deeply felt poetry that shines.<br /><br />\\"Just Once\\" expresses Shaumyan's deep loneliness:<br /><br />Just once I want to feel free from this depression,<br /><br />Just once.......<br /><br />O to feel the sadness of the naked Moon,<br /><br />to touch the needles of despair, to hug the stones of pain.<br /><br />Tonight dress me in black velvet and hang me upon a<br /><br />cross.<br /><br />In \\"O God, I Could Never Create\\" he cries out for an Earth and a humanity he longs to rescue:<br /><br />But I can kiss the Earth, breathing Love into<br /><br />this once infertile soil,<br /><br />And I can make this paper into music,<br /><br />\\"To a Poet Who Looks for Dinosaurs in His Toilet Bowl\\" mixes Shaumyan's bizarre humor with the poet's hope:<br /><br />.....that verbal acrobat playing<br /><br />with images and words<br /><br />that spread a magic veil<br /><br />over the world of anguish,<br /><br />loneliness and despair --<br /><br />He rails hopelessly against the world's ugliness and sorrow in \\"Some Thoughts on War and Human Ugliness\\":<br /><br />I'm not in my right mind and<br /><br />I cannot write poetry amidst it all --<br /><br />as if something inside me has been<br /><br />cut --<br /><br />As always, he dreams of desire, love and hope, but tempers these thoughts with harsh realism, as in \\"With Years\\":<br /><br />With years your drive goes down<br /><br />And your soul<br /><br />Becomes accustomed to the daily grind --<br /><br />With years you, too, become a local clown<br /><br />Indifferent to everything and blind.<br /><br />Alexander Shaumyan is a prolific poet who writes in a wide range of styles on a multitude of subjects.

This is my first experience with Yoho's work and I hope it won't be my last.  Don't let the whimsical title lull you to a chuckling complacency.  What you will find in this work is not all fun and frolic.<br /><br />Yes, Max Yoho uses humor quite effectively in verse.  I laughed out loud at his droll rendering of \\"Secret Underpants\\" and \\"Cornbread Poem\\", for example, and the brevity of \\"Failed Haiku\\" was a standout.  Nothing is safe from his humor, not even the family cat.  His rhymes deliver a pleasing cadence and are filled with irony and humor.  He sets his readers up with such folksy humor, then strikes a stunning coup de grace with emotionally intense free verse.<br /><br />One such example is \\"1942\\", which I feel compelled to quote in its entirety:<br /><br />Standing.<br /><br />Close enough to feel<br /><br />the fresh turned gravel<br /><br />through my thin-soled shoes.<br /><br />No fake grass to obscure<br /><br />the reality of that bare hole.<br /><br />Rifles popped and echoed.<br /><br />A far away bugle gave us<br /><br />the saddest of all Amens,<br /><br />which chilled and chilled.<br /><br />My father shuddered<br /><br />and pulled me close.<br /><br />Embarrassed and ashamed for him,<br /><br />I watched teardrops leave his eyes<br /><br />to fall on that ground<br /><br />which was only beginning to show<br /><br />its insatiable hunger<br /><br />for the young men of our town.<br /><br />In \\"Birthday Greetings\\" a son visits his mother in the nursing home, a place she didn't want to be.  I quote the last poignant verse:<br /><br />I hand her roses...\\"so proud of you!  You are ninety-one<br /><br />and still beautiful!\\"<br /><br />Distracted by the roses, she forgets to remind me<br /><br />of the awful thing I let happen.<br /><br />In the Thoughts and Essays portion of his book are priceless tasty tidbits, once again, of humor.  And Yoho shares with us his darker secrets:  His penchant for commiting weenie-cide;  What wisdom might be found in Playboy; The root cause of his ineptitude with women; His version of a cure for yeast infections.  After that chuckle break, the author segues to the Short Stories section.  His stories feature heroes with imaginative names and heroines who face life with courage or staunch pragmatism.  I found mysterious coincidences in his stories, and soul chilling renderings of wars won or loves lost.  Occasional macabre undertones and often touching understatement bring magic to his stories.<br /><br />Whether writing poetry or prose, Max Yoho is a gifted wordsmith.  A master at humor and irony, touching tributes to past times and lost friends, or any other topic imaginable, his work is well worth savoring.<br /><br />Laurel Johnson<br /><br />Midwest Book Reviewause of his ineptitude with women; His version of a cure for yeast infections.

His writing style is reminscent of the 19th century and very European in flavor.  Rehak's work is different, his topics off center just enough to add a sense of intriguing unpredictablity into the read.  This third book by David Rehak, while a different subject, clearly<br /><br />reflects his unique voice as writer.<br /><br />The setting of Crippled Dreams is rural France in the 1870s.  The Prussians have swept through the bucolic countryside, raping and destroying as they go.  Rose Petit is one of their helpless victims.  Eight months pregnant, with her husband fighting away from home, she's set upon by four Prussian<br /><br />soldiers bent on claiming Rose and her farm as spoils of war.  When Rose defies them, they beat her mercilessly and leave her for dead.  Her first born son is physically damaged from the beating and born paralyzed in both legs.<br /><br />Rose loves her crippled son, Alexandre, and lavishes him with mother love from birth.  Even when her husband Paul returns from war and a second son, Gustave, is born, Alexandre receives the lion's share of her love and attention.  Through such loving attentions, Rose hopes her crippled son's soul will be made fine, if not his ruined body.<br /><br />As Alexandre ages, his bitterness and hopeless rage increase incrementally. He silently observes the world around him, filled with healthy, happy people with unimpaired bodies, and curses a God who picks and chooses who He blesses.  He blasphemes God at every opportunity and refuses to believe<br /><br />Rose's assurances of a loving Heavenly Father.  His feelings of resentment come to full flower when Gustave starts courting Marie-Anne Godard. Marie-Anne is a beauty, with billows of dark hair and flashing eyes that reveal a captivating spirit.<br /><br />Alexandre dreams of finding true love with his brother's fiancee but accepts her loyal friendship as a poor substitue.  When Gustave discovers that Alexandre and Marie-Anne have become close friends, his temper sets off a situation that ends in horrible tragedy.  In the aftermath, nothing can be done to lessen Alexandre's despair.  Only God's grace and mercy can heal a crippled body, mind, and spirit, but can a loving God reach Alexandre?<br /><br />David Rehak takes common situations and transforms them to uncommon through  his use of words and his development of interesting characters.

In this amazing book, the author shares intimate details of Ireland throughout the 20th century.  Events leading up to the Easter Rising of<br /><br />1916, the Civil War of the 1920s, and World War II are thoroughly documented as de Valera weaves a rich and fascinating tapestry of the times.  For this information alone the book is priceless, and yet the author gives readers so<br /><br />much more than simply a lesson in politics.<br /><br />Born in 1922, the youngest of seven de Valera children, Terry grew up in a very different Ireland than exists today.  Charming, chatty anecdotes reveal fascinating tidbits of everyday life in the twenties and thirties when the<br /><br />atmosphere and standards of Irish society were far removed from what they are today.  Formality of dress and social interaction, rudimentary treatments for medical conditions, experiencing death and funerals,  and listening to news on the wireless radio are but a few reminiscences adding interest to this book.  The author also shares tender memories of childhood<br /><br />in an unspoiled and undeveloped countryside, as well as his years at Blackrock College.  His recollections of rugby games, struggles with Latin, and trips to the confessional enlighten and entertain.  But the meat of de Valera's memoir concerns the life and times of his father.<br /><br />The author clearly states one purpose of his memoir is to correct long held beliefs about his father.  For example, Eamon de Valera has been portrayed rather unsympathetically as a man without humor or humanity.  Information from those who knew him best proves the one time President of Ireland and the League of Nations to be a man of great strength with passionately held<br /><br />loyalties and beliefs, a man quick to apologize and forgive.<br /><br />Through the notes of Terry's mother, Sinead de Valera contributes powerful commentaries about the life she shared with Eamon.  She tells of his many imprisonments due to hard stands against British controls of Irish freedoms. Of particular interest were details of their friendship with Michael Collins and why Collins signed the treaty in de Valera's absence.  Her notes address in detail the Gaelic League, Sinn Fein, and secret plans the Allies devised<br /><br />to pressure Ireland into joining them in World War II.  I found Mrs. de Valera's contributions to this book to be invaluable.<br /><br />It's impossible to cover in review the information found in Terry de Valera's memoir.  In essence, the author looks back with grace on a long life lived with humor and honesty, providing pieces to a picture of his famous father who was President of an Ireland long gone.Valera contributes powerful commentaries about the life she shared with Eamon.

At his touch, the mundane moments of life are disarmingly transformed to lyrical.  Country of Memory is this poet's fifth book length collection.  Everything about his latest offering is choice, from the esthetically pleasing cover to the contents.<br /><br />With a sympathetic eye, he paints word pictures of childhood memories.  Whether these thoughts put to paper are troubling or sentimental, we live moments of his life through a careful choice of words and cadence.  In this excerpt  from \\"Words\\", for example, the writer reflects on a conversation with his father.  It expresses passionately the poet's love of language:<br /><br />  I loved words as much as you<br /><br />  loved silence: words that wakened<br /><br />  intoxicated  explored  words<br /><br />  with the rank smell of viscera<br /><br />  that excoriated  and restored<br /><br />  I collected words,  forged from gold<br /><br />  or zirconium  words ethereal as breath<br /><br />  and dark plutonium words  more fatal<br /><br />  than death  Words my daggers<br /><br />  my lariats  my fire-scorched tongs<br /><br />  my antlers  my cockscomb  my<br /><br />  rhinocerous horn  words my plunging beak<br /><br />  my wild and thorny cry.<br /><br />Mr Fishman contemplates the seasons in New England, wonders to be found along the ocean's shore, and our purpose within nature.  And \\"With Jack in Egypt\\" he embraces the spirit of Jack Kerouac, who represents an era few of us today remember:<br /><br />  ...I hear Jack tapping grace-<br /><br />  notes onto the scrolling<br /><br />  page: his white-magic<br /><br />  tantric spells  and blitzing<br /><br />  ecstasies  his prayers<br /><br />  for release from the dark<br /><br />  50s furies of America,<br /><br />  as if he were a spirit<br /><br />  who could not find<br /><br />  his Egypt.<br /><br />And finally, he writes psalms of regret and hindsight regarding love and losses he has known.  Love lyrics quiet and profound express regret and hope in \\"Another Life\\":<br /><br />  Things fail - we know this.<br /><br />  But these hands once touched you<br /><br />  with a grace your body answered,<br /><br />  and we knew that pleasure intended<br /><br />  to stay: a lazy continuum.<br /><br />Charles Fishman uses words like a jackhammer, a searchlight, a scalpel, and a lover's hand.

The work of poet David Chorlton has appeared in award winning chapbooks, in small press magazines, online, and in full-length books.  Chorlton is also an artist of merit.  His surrealistic creation, Morning Shift, graces the front cover of this latest book.  In art, as well as poetry, he captures the full essence of what it means to be human. Reflections on  alienation, displacement, nostalgia, and wonder are recurring themes throughout.<br /><br />Born in Austria and raised in the UK, Chorlton moved to the U.S. decades ago.  And yet he still considers himself to be an \\"alien among aliens\\", struggling to make sense out of life in America.  He celebrates wild places near his home in Arizona with glorious word pictures, such those found in \\"Monsoon Dusk\\":<br /><br />  We go down to the grasslands<br /><br />  by slowly fading sun<br /><br />  to hear the sparrows,<br /><br />  little jewelers in sound,<br /><br />  chip away the silence<br /><br />  that precedes the evening storm<br /><br />  when peals of thunder leap<br /><br />  from peak to peak across the canyon<br /><br />  and electricity illuminates<br /><br />  the linen white wings<br /><br />  on a sphinx moth drawn<br /><br />  into dispassionate light.<br /><br />Adversely, he muses over political bombast, searching for a thread of hope in \\"The Sign\\":<br /><br />  All the words pit good<br /><br />  against evil, leaving no space<br /><br />  in between for the desert<br /><br />  to break open<br /><br />  where a tiny stalk might appear<br /><br />  on which to hang<br /><br />  the truce flag.<br /><br />A return visit to his European roots is equally unsettling.  With one foot not yet grounded in America and the other in Eastern Europe, Chorlton attempts to straddle both worlds.  \\"Notes From a Visit in March\\" is one haunting example:<br /><br />  Within my first steps back<br /><br />  my old city slips<br /><br />  around my shoulders<br /><br />  like a wool coat.  And walking on<br /><br />  into the grey streets<br /><br />  I keep expecting<br /><br />  the trap to close behind me.<br /><br />His yearning for a welcoming somewhere, a common hope we all share, is clear in \\"Seeing Someone Else's Country\\":<br /><br />  To feel like an honoured guest<br /><br />  inside your own borders<br /><br />  is what you really want.<br /><br />\\"Seeing Moscow, 1971\\" is particularly poignant, because he sees the beauty and chaos through memory's eyes:<br /><br />  ...while smoke climbs<br /><br />  from chimneys in delicate threads<br /><br />  cut by scissors of wind.<br /><br />And later in the same poem:<br /><br />  ...gilded domes and crosses<br /><br />  left over from a history<br /><br />  rather forgotten<br /><br />  but too beautiful to destroy.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed his tribute to Franz Kafka, where humor and irony play off each other in a mock interview.  His reminiscences of Samuel Johnson and Alfred Kubin were enlightening and thought provoking.  But it is in his poetic documentation of life that David Chorlton shines.<br /><br />Chorlton's range of topics and his ability to capture life are often stunning.  Frightening dreams, everyday nightmares, the grisly face of war, the soothing balm of nature and music -- all are blended beautifully with his skilled surrealistic touches.<br /><br />Fans of David Chorlton will relish Return to Waking Life.

Azucar, in particular, never forgets her childhood of poverty, exploitation, violence, and abuse.  She is determined to make life better for those who must labor long hours under a merciless tropical sun.  Sugar cane fields and European-owned plantations have given way to pricey tourist hideaways.  Still,  laborers struggle daily with unimaginable horrors and hardships that persist in their island paradise.  With their latest business venture, Azucar and Lucien plan to pay workers well, treat them humanely, and create new financial channels into impoverished areas.  Their idealistic plans are threatened from the outset.<br /><br />First, wealthy tourists - members of the influential Montalvo family - are horribly murdered, victims of a kreyol ritual.  Sociopolitical tensions result from these unsolved murders while a displaced work force of discontented sugar cane workers rebel against decadent consumerism.  Will outside forces ruin Azucar's plans?  And will she betray beneficial island spirits to achieve her goals?<br /><br />Azucar's Sweet Hope is a realistic picture of what happens when greedy, racist businessmen and politicians combine forces to gain wealth and power.  The result, as always, is the raping of a country's resources and ruination of the poor who serve as laborers.  Cambeira writes honestly, with powerful, persuasive prose.  Through his words, inhumanity and hope, beauty and sadism, love and squallor come alive in the island paradise he loves.<br /><br />Laurel Johnson<br /><br />Midwest Book Reviewthe poor who serve as laborers.

Honest.  Uncomplicated.  Heartwarming.  The characters are as real and human as any I have enjoyed in recent memory.  Scott Fields is a writer with promise, and one whose work I hope to read again.<br /><br />Frank Watson is an irascible retired farmer toughing out a solitary existence.  Life has been meaningless to Frank since his wife's unexpected death two years ago.  Without Ida as the centerpiece of his life, he's lost interest in everything.  His once well-kept farm home and yard have been neglected as he goes through the motions, interacting on a superficial level with family and long time friends.  Adding to Frank's sorrow is a once proud, strong father reduced to living in a local nursing home.  Each visit finds the elder Watson more dependent and confused, less the man he used to be.<br /><br />Frank's daily trip to town for breakfast at Bob's Diner is the high point of each day.  There he trades sometimes sarcastic, often profane ribbing with townfolk he's known all his life.  Bob's Diner is the local gathering place where folks share gossip, enjoy good food. and discuss the depressed farm economy.  Springfield, their home town, has been going downhill for years.  Two catalysts force Frank Watson to step outside his grief.  First comes news of a corporate egg farm and promises of \\"big money\\" for farmers willing to sell their property.  Then a new waitress starts working at Bob's Diner.  Pepper Ledley is young enough to be Frank's daughter but the chemistry between them is immediate and unmistakeable.  Frank's life is turned upside down by his attraction to a younger woman.  And he's the only man in town who suspects the big spending corporation is not the solution to Springfield's economic problems.<br /><br />The charm of A Summer Harvest is in the minute details that comprise Frank Watson's life.  With poignant toughness, humor, and single minded devotion to his past and future, Watson takes each obstacle head on.  He's an unforgettable character, believable and true to his beliefs.

US	36398642	R1HO9TSRONF4OE	0525948007	683071329	The Windmill	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Satisfying, well written tale	One pre-release review described The Windmill as a weepy tale that was hollow at the center.  I respectfully but emphatically disagree.  The story was touching, yes, but there was nothing hollow about it.  The characters were so appealing that by book's end I felt like they were dear, long-time friends.  Locations near the blustery Atlantic are beautifully detailed by the author.  And Ms. Gertler's writing syle is adept, skillfully evoking a sense of place and time.  She has the gift of taking readers into her character's hearts and minds, revealing nuances that might otherwise be missed.<br /><br />The brilliant but distracted Professor Carl Larkin has always been reliable and predictable.  When he leaves for work one morning and simply disappears, no one in his life can explain or understand such action.  His wife of more than twenty years, Olivia, is frightened and confused.  This is not the first time in her life a husband left and failed to return.  She's never recovered from losing her first husband, Noah, in a robbery gone bad.  In fact, her heart has never healed from that loss.  Carl Larkin had tenderly courted Olivia when she was a young widow.  Their marriage and life seemed stable.  They'd raised two children together.  Yet Olivia had lost her faith and bitterly given up on hope with the death of her first husband.  At the time of Carl's disappearance, much remained unspoken between them despite their years together.  Noah's memories had been too painful to examine so remain compartmentalized.<br /><br />Carl has wrestled with his secret demons for forty one years.  No one has ever really known him.  He's never shared his past with anyone, not even Olivia.  Facing down that past is long overdue.  Confronting secret truths takes Carl back to his southern roots where he reacquaints himself with his mother and first love, abandoned at age seventeen.  His brief phone calls home to Olivia provide more questions than answers.  Both fear their marriage will not survive the truths they need to share.<br /><br />The story is told in an interesting way, from first Olivia's and then Carl's point of view.  This technique added depth and dimension to the plot as it unfolds.  Carl wonders if he can retrieve the lifetime he lost at a young age.  While absent from Olivia, he tries to put his life back together in an effort to be whole again.  And Olivia finally heals a heart that has been faltering for twenty five years.  Both learn the heartbreak that comes of holding onto and letting go of the past.  But will their revelations bind them closer together or tear them apart?<br /><br />This is a satisfying and well written tale of love, loss, family, and the trials that strengthen us as humans if we let them.  Gertler fans will not be disappointed in this latest book.  Her characters are real, the emotions honest. Readers not familiar with her work should consider  adding The Windmill to their reading list.ll not survive the truths they need to share. <br />  <br />The story is told in an interesting way, from first Olivia's and then Carl's point of view.

Ms. Morell's writing is beautiful in its simplicity, her prose style elegant.  Although these stories are skillfully interconnected, several of them have been published separately and can easily stand alone.<br /><br />Each story involves Ellie and her family.  Mother Elizabeth and father Tom have been divorced for several years for reasons neither Ellie or her brother Toby fully understand.  Elizabeth has always been a little off the beam.  Tom suddenly transforms himself from happy, loving husband and father to a frigid ice man who locks himself behind closed doors.  Toby is reclusive, a deep thinker, confused and troubled by family interactions.  And Ellie faces life on a superficial level, slightly cynical, reluctant to establish ties with anyone.  The biker customers frequenting the bar where Ellie as a bartender seem more real to her than others in her life.  Through these four troubled characters, Ms. Morell  reveals in increments the sources of their dysfunction.  I overuse the word \\"stunning\\" perhaps, but sometimes stunning is the only word that will suffice.  The truths revealed by Ms. Morell  are stunning.<br /><br />One haunting example is \\"Going Deaf\\", where Ellie contemplates her father's behavior, his many ex-wives, the reasons for his cold behavior.<br /><br />\\"Deep Sleep\\" reveals a shocking secret in Elizabeth's past.  It  serves as a sorrowful explanation for the divorce from Tom and lays the groundwork for her mental unraveling.<br /><br />These two short stories mentioned were the linchpins that powerfully tied past, present and future happenings together.  In the end, Ellie is forced to reach outside her cynicism to find meaning in the world.  She and Toby return to their roots in an attempt to re-establish common ground.  By the end, Ellie and Toby have no one left but each other.<br /><br />Broken Water is alternately painful and poignant, triumphant and troubling, pure and profound.  The characters are memorable and the thoughts eloquently expressed.and poignant, triumphant and troubling, pure and profound.

This second book takes his memoir one step further through fiction that has the clear ring of truth.  Anyone of Irish ancestry, or those interested in things Irish, should relish  this book of strong characters living through the pivotal times of two centuries in Ireland and America.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me was Michael Mulligan.  Several of the stories feature Mulligan and his ancestors.  In 1847, Michael Mulligan is a fine, young figure of a man, a stable groom who escapes Ireland with Maria Burke who is married to a cruel English landowner.  The ship they take to America is infested with typhus.  Maria dies, leaving Mulligan alone to seek his fortune in San Francisco.  He is a fascinating figure, strong willed and intelligent.  When he meets his son John in 1888 at the Gettysburg battlefield, their relationship is strained.  The elder Mulligan had gone to war when John Mulligan was young, and must explain his failure to return.  The author sympathetically follows the Mulligans as each generation investigates their Irish roots.<br /><br />Corrigan skillfully captures important aspects of Irish and American history.  Ireland's plague and famine.  The American Civil War.  The San Francisco earthquake of 1906.  World War Two.  The Berlin crisis.  The Civil Rights Movement.  And that awful decade of political assassinations that devastated America.  We see history through the eyes of Corrigan's intriguing characters.  The Mulligans, Kennedys and O'Learys.  Sean Dineen, Gingles O'Malley, and others.<br /><br />The heart and spirit of each character and their time resonates through Corrigan's pristine prose.  Moments of love, beauty, joy, and sorrow shine in these twenty stories of strong and courageous people.	2004-10-24

The title quotes a Polish woman working in the Auschwitz Museum coffee shop, her gentle reminder to high spirited Polish youth that the place represents anything but joy.  It is this premise that sets the tone for the poet's powerful observations and remembrances.<br /><br />Pacosz takes in the sights, committing them to memory for sharing later, quietly contemplating her father and grandparent's homeland, as in \\"At Morskie Oko Lake, Zakopane\\":<br /><br />  It is a grey country<br /><br />  even when the sky is blue<br /><br />  and today it is raining.<br /><br />  Mist gathers itself,<br /><br />  a quiet fist<br /><br />  clutching the mountains.<br /><br />\\"In the Country\\" deftly compares rural labor in Poland with that in America:<br /><br />  No mono-crops<br /><br />  stretching the horizon<br /><br />  but a landscape<br /><br />  of human proportions,<br /><br />  made for the bent back<br /><br />  and the long haul.<br /><br />One of my favorite poems is \\"Auschwitz: Oswiecim\\".

Sheehan is praised for beautiful poetry and stunning prose, but many of his fans don't know he writes gritty mysteries.  I doubt if Spillane at his best could equal this one.  Tough talking cops and private eyes, lush leggy blondes and redheads, and shadowy villains bring excitement to Death for the Phantom Receiver  The cast of characters and noir style make this book a standout among mysteries.<br /><br />Paul Lanyard, owner of the New England Phantoms football team, is a self made man.  He knows how to make money and where to invest it.  What Lanyard doesn't know is how to cure the feeling, the knowing in his gut that someone is murdering his players.  One player has been shot, one killed by a hit and run vehicle, and another poisoned.  Verifying that gut feeling will take a special kind of team, a team he's hired before on other projects, private investigators Kell Thorn and Harry Krisman.<br /><br />Kell and Harry bring their individual strengths to any investigation.  But this time around, the Massachusetts based partners seem to be tracking smoke and shadows.<br /><br />Harry Krisman is a slightly gimped up ex-cop who doesn't let a partial leg prosthesis slow him down.  Harry is a one woman man, enamored of Prof. Maxine Humdroph.  Her intelligence and charm often sets his mind wandering at inopportune times, but few crooks stand a chance once Harry zeroes in on them.<br /><br />Kell Thorn is a defrocked judge with fashion sense and an eye for the ladies.  Cops and judges along the eastern seaboard owe him favors and he's not above calling on them in a pinch.  From first meeting, Savannah born and bred Magnolia Comfort has Kell by the short hairs, both literally and figuratively.<br /><br />Phantoms draft pick, Kelvar Hobbins, is young, black and beautiful, with the power of ancient Africa firing bones and sinews. He fears ending up dead like several of his Phantoms teammates.  Kelvar's grandmother, Sadie Janelle Hobbins, is still young and vital, a sexual dynamo.  Her stable of boyfriends stand at the ready to do anything she asks of them.<br /><br />When Harry disappears without a trace, Maxine and Magnolia head south to Florida, determined to help Kell find him.  Whatever female strategy it takes, Max and Maggie are determined to bring Harry home alive.  All three find themselves drawn into Tampa's dark underbelly, pursuing an odd assortment of slim leads and shady suspects.<br /><br />Death for the Phantom Receiver is a modern stylish thriller, sparked with subtle hints of noir glamor and intrigue.  Think savvy heroes like Bogart or Gable.  Think feisty dames like Lombard or Bacall.  Then mix them all together in a twenty first century Tarantino film and you'll have a hint of how Sheehan builds a mystery genre thriller.

According to one critic, Tom Sheehan is a \\"national treasure.\\"  After reading  A Collection of Friends, I agree.  This book is also a treasure.  Sheehan writes with a kindly intimacy that welcomes readers into his life.  His words are rich with cadence and imagery as he remembers the sounds, sights, scents, and ghostly voices from his years in Saugus, Mass.  Several stories from his book were nominated for Pushcart Prizes and many more of them deserved to be.<br /><br />In the Preface, Sheehan says of his friends:  \\"Piecemeal, as entities, in my ear, clapping me on the back, giving me a push when needed,  they have caused this book.  I am indebted to them, those who have given my life all its savage joys.\\"<br /><br />From a lovingly tended larder of memories, the author spins camera-clear stories of family, friends, war, town drunks, places and pleasures, long held sorrows.  Each is a moving testimony to man's grit and pride or quiet acceptance of adversity.  Everything, everyplace, and everyone become objects in Tom Sheehan's social laboratory.  His experiences as a lad made him what he is today as writer in his eighth decade.  He tells of hunger as if it were a living entity, and the \\"awful sense of exposure\\" borne of poverty.  Sensory perceptions were absorbed in his youth like a sponge.  Tragedies forgotten over time still live fresh in his mind and won't let go.<br /><br />Each story stands alone and is memorable in distinct ways.  I give only a few examples due to space limitations  \\"The Dumpmaster's Boy\\" is one of several paeans to Sheehan's grandfather, who loved his fellow man, quoted Irish poets, wrote his own lyrical poetry, and longed to see his homeland Ireland one more time.<br /><br />\\"Orion's Belt\\" is an unintended social commentary, a lesson in grace, strength, poverty, and snobbish cruelty with Sheehan's beautiful, dignified mother shining as a central figure.<br /><br />\\"The Day Titanic Drowned\\", the memory of a powerful draft animal that drowned decades ago, is a standout.  The day and the animal come alive through Sheehan's telling.<br /><br />\\"Parkie, Tanker, Tiger of Tobruk\\" is a numbing account of desert survival circa WW 2, how one man escaped death in war only to die by inches for decades after his return to Saugus.<br /><br />And \\"The Quiet, Empty Bedrooms of Saugus\\" was so beautifully written, so emotionally overwhelming that it must be read to fully comprehend.  Any words I write here are inadequate.<br /><br />Tom Sheehan treasures his memories.  To quote the author, \\"The clarity stings the memory....  Somehow, inexplicably, it is soul deep, has pine aromas, the acrobatics of light, known temperature touching my face the way I recall the stand on a lone Korean outpost.\\"<br /><br />I've never been to Massachusetts, know nothing of Saugus or Tom Sheehan, but feel I know them well through A Collection of Friends.l that drowned decades ago, is a standout.

His philosophy is aptly expressed in the Preface of this book:<br /><br />  ...and I shall always touch you,<br /><br />  Mother Earth, Rare Earth,<br /><br />  from all vantages in these<br /><br />  flights of uncounted time;<br /><br />It was a difficult task choosing examples from Sheehan's poetry.  Whether many stanzas long, or brief, each poem told a story that  enthralled, brought laughter or a tear.  The poems are divided into four distinct categories:<br /><br />  In the Hearth and Self;<br /><br />  In the Universe;<br /><br />  In the Confrontation;<br /><br />  The Air Around Me.<br /><br />I was particularly drawn to Sheehan's thoughts on aging, lost family members and friends.  One powerful example on mortality is found in \\"Voice from the Gray\\":<br /><br />  ...in one giant leap,<br /><br />  went seventeen to seventy,<br /><br />  found response, am still there.<br /><br />  Walked home from war, heartbreak,<br /><br />  the hill above that holds your voice,<br /><br />  Riverside where the stone deftly scribed<br /><br />  is hardly your last sign, where we<br /><br />  will touch again<br /><br />  underground.<br /><br />In \\"Thomas, Thomas\\", the poet contemplates his father while watching his son play:<br /><br />  Oh, years close such ugly jaws between father<br /><br />  And son, between the old and the dreaming,<br /><br />  Between the looking back and the looking forward,<br /><br />  So I cheat sometimes and think the looking back<br /><br />  Has more magic, the greater reserves of splendor,.<br /><br />\\"Four More Poems the Road Gave Up\\" is a four part anthem.

In \\"Small Boats at Aveiro\\", Sheehan records his thoughts on a painting set in Portugal by Peter Rogers, Nahant marine artist:<br /><br />  They are not<br /><br />  Deserted, though faintly cold for oarsmen<br /><br />  Who walk down this beach behind me,<br /><br />  Stomachs piqued and perched with wine,<br /><br />  Salted hands still warm with women, mouths<br /><br />  Rich of imagery and signals.<br /><br />Grieving the losses of war has been a familiar cry of late and in times past.

This poem was honed lovingly and, like the muse that drives him,  Watkins \\"sees on the larger scale of time.\\"<br /><br />At the poem's beginning, he meets a fellow hiker in the woods, where hardwood trees have lost their leaves, and some have died:<br /><br />I love even dead trees I said and then<br /><br />I said to this stranger something I'd only half thought<br /><br />to myself, that trees are different<br /><br />in death than we are; the spirit<br /><br />stays with the body of trees, makes them<br /><br />grow beautiful in death as our bodies, the spirit<br /><br />gone, grow putrid.<br /><br />And later, Watkins considers the various trees and how they grow, reaching for sunlight, living despite the elements:<br /><br />Maybe chestnut oaks like steep hillsides<br /><br />for the same reason<br /><br />Cedars like rocky land and<br /><br />River Birches<br /><br />the banks of streams:<br /><br />because other trees leave those spaces<br /><br />largely alone<br /><br />  with all that light for the taking...<br /><br />Watkins believes every tree has its story, which he tries to understand.  One large fallen tree, for example:<br /><br />lies down the hillside like a thick, long, and hollow script, to title<br /><br />one more ghost story the forest air records, all about how<br /><br />it had grown a hundred eighty lucky years on the slope so tall<br /><br />  when it crashed the sky leapt back<br /><br />  fast as tiger dreams.<br /><br />The poet knows he should be working at his day job instead of studying the trees, but then he might miss the subtle play of light and shadow as clouds pass overhead, luminous cracks of light, and storms:<br /><br />...silvered three dimensional shadow of the sky passing over,<br /><br />the long tentacles of light raiding sparkling sky spots by rolling the gray over<br /><br />readily as the foot hills lean after the storm like they were clothes<br /><br />his transparency leans within to leap.<br /><br />Like the trees he loves, in this book Watkins performs a graceful \\"dance before God.\\"  Ghost Trees is not a poem to simply read and forget.  It's one to experience and savor, down to the marrow of your bones.  Absorb the spirit of fallen trees.  Let your eyes take in the wintry sky.  Inhale the scent of pungent earth.  And share the poet's exquisite longing to understand past eons through the trees that lived them.  Highly recommended.g sparkling sky spots by rolling the gray over <br />readily as the foot hills lean after the storm like they were clothes <br />his transparency leans within to leap. <br />  <br />Like the trees he loves, in this book Watkins performs a graceful \\"dance before God.\\"  Ghost Trees is not a poem to simply read and forget.

US	36398642	R3SI7WCRZXIX8X	1932961003	527554070	The Green Age of Asher Witherow	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Exquisitely written first novel	The early buzz on this debut novel serves up terms like: \\"poetic intensity\\"; \\"strikingly beautiful prose style\\"; \\"unerring instinct for storytelling\\"; \\"a startling accomplishment\\"; and \\"lushly talented\\".  I will state emphatically that Mr. Cunningham's first novel is all that and much more.  This is a literary novel in the finest sense of the word, magnetic and seductive from first word to last.<br /><br />Asher Witherow's story is told in first person.  Young Asher is the only child of Welsh immigrants.  His mother, Abicca, is strong, matriarchal.  Father David works in the Black Diamond Mines circa the 1860s.  Life is harsh and sometimes cruel for folks living in the dreary confines of the Contra Costa County California mining country.  Miners work long hours below ground and their children join them at a very young age.  Young Asher is no exception.  He's a bright boy, curious and irrepressible.  Death is witnessed at every turn, and stoically accepted as a necessary part of life in hard times.  Asher's outlook is influenced by a young ministerial apprentice, Josiah Lyte, who wishes for the boy a better life.  Friends Thomas Motion and Anna Flood bring life-changing influences to Asher's world.  Present throughout is a strong sense of time and place, beautifully expressed.<br /><br />The elderly Asher recounts his life in retrospect.  His own words state best what life has been.  \\"...I know the great black hole won't receive me till I've tied my guts into sailor's knots over regrets and dreams and other torments I'm helpless to alter.\\"<br /><br />It's impossible to adequately review such excellence.  I've given you the bare essence of The Green Age of Asher Witherow.  Readers who appreciate fine literary fiction or the classics simply must read this book.  Those who enjoy American history and well written tales will find it exemplary.  This is a book to be savored, written by a gifted wordsmith.  It has my highest recommendation.<br />	2004-09-18

But he was a still-wet-behind-the-ears transplant from Oklahoma when he first met Richard Brautigan in 1978.  Brautigan was a best selling author, world traveler, and counter culture legend-who counted among his friends John Lennon, Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, Jimmy Buffet, Rip Torn, and Francis Ford Coppola.  For reasons Keeler can't explain, Brautigan took a liking to him and thereby hangs the tale.<br /><br />Despite rubbing elbows with icons of the film and popular music culture, Brautigan was a common man, salt of the earth.  He circulated with the rich and famous, or fished and bent an elbow with locals in and around Bozeman with equal enthusiasm.  Keeler's recollection of their friendship is at times hilarious or poignant, but just as often disturbing and sad.  That they were friends in the truest sense is evident in every line.<br /><br />Brautigan was larger than life, like his hero Hemingway before him.  He was a man of \\"wonderful, scary, craziness\\", a big, funny, quicksilver man given to zany pranks and heavy drinking.  He loved a hearty joke or play on words, but was prone to paranoia once he'd reached a certain stage of inebriation.  It wasn't always easy maintaining a friendship with Brautigan.  He was often deliberately cruel, especially to his friends.  But those who might think Keeler stuck with Brautigan for money or favors would be far off the mark.<br /><br />With priceless chapter titles, such as my favorite,  \\"Night of the Living Borscht\\", Keeler shares his memories of Brautigan.  The result is a complete picture of this flawed and complicated man who salved insecurity, loneliness and sorrow with rage, humor, and massive doses of alcohol.  Keeler painted his friend as a man who lived with \\"a huge hole in his chest\\" after his wife divorced him.  That huge hole was replaced with a smaller hole in his head in 1984 when Brautigan committed suicide.<br /><br />To Keeler, his friend Brautigan represented an unpredictable, idiosyncratic and charming addition to his otherwise normal life.  Brautigan considered the art of writing as mining gold from the air or loading mercury with a pitchfork.  He would be proud of what his friend Greg Keeler has written because he has, indeed, mined gold and loaded mercury to perfection.<br /><br />There may be other books out there about Brautigan and his life, but I suggest you start with this one.  There can be no truer portrait of the man than one written by a friend who loved him, warts and all.tigan committed suicide. <br />  <br />To Keeler, his friend Brautigan represented an unpredictable, idiosyncratic and charming addition to his otherwise normal life.

Every book she writes is exciting, entertaining, delightful, sensuous, and more.  She's gained a loyal following for good reason.<br /><br />The setting of Jena's Choice is late 1860s Texas.  Eighteen year old Jena Grant has had too much sorrow in her young life.  First her parents died in a freak accident.  Then her older brother Jared is killed by a back shooting coward, leaving a grief stricken Jena and her younger brother Randy to manage their large cattle ranch.  Jared is barely in his grave when Everett Walker comes calling with an ultimatum.  Jena must either marry one of his sons or lose the ranch.  Everett and his son Carl are bullies, neighboring ranchers who rule that area of Texas through intimidation and violence.  Jena knows only too well the kind of man Carl Walker is, and vows to control her own fate.<br /><br />Flint McKay was Jared Grant's best friend for years.  Flint is a half breed Apache living in a white man's world.  He and his little sister Marissa were orphaned at an early age.  His parents' deaths remain a mystery.  When Flint offers to marry Jena, she decides to go with the familiar.  She's known Flint for years and trusts he is a decent man.  Despite Flint's wishes otherwise, their marriage is a business proposition, nothing more.  Jena has vowed that no man or husband will ever share her bed.<br /><br />Everett Walker wants Flint, Jena, and Randy dead, and he wants the Grant ranch by any means.  Carl Walker wants Jena.  She's been his sexual obsession for several years.  Her marriage to an Indian enrages him.  The Walkers and their cohorts use every means at their disposal to rid themselves of anyone who stands in their way.<br /><br />Flint proves himself to be a devoted husband and an efficient overseer of the ranch.  Jena learns surprising secrets about her handsome husband and her brother Jared.  Flint honors their business arrangement, but sets out to teach his fearful wife the full meaning of love and desire between a wife and husband.  The story sizzles as Ms. Scott allows the chemistry between Flint and Jena to slowly simmer over time.  She also does a thorough job of developing her characters as they are forced to face the prejudices of the times.  Indians, Mexicans, and blacks are reviled.  Prostitutes are treated as less than human cast offs by townsfolk.  And yet it is Flint's Apache relatives, a loyal black man, Jena's Mexican cook, and several prostitutes who rally to the Grant's defense against the Walkers.<br /><br />Action and adventure, love and romance, courage and devotion -- all contribute to the story in tantalizing ways.

Yes, it is button collector's nirvana for certain.  But it's also an informed commentary on the history, highlights, and championship teams produced by Penn State and Joe Paterno over a 32-year period.  From the feisty Lions mascot on the front cover to the photographs sprinkled throughout, this book is loaded with intriguing trivia and presented in a fun, charming, and entertaining style.  Both authors grew up in the shadow of Mt. Nittany.  Penn State and Beaver Stadium  have always been a large part of their lives.  Both are PSU alumni and witnessed the Paterno years up close and personal.<br /><br />The booster buttons represented in this book were produced by bank sponsors, free to everyone, and are a tradition at Penn State.  PSU football buttons represent the longest continuous promotion of a college sports program in the nation.  Every button for every game is featured.  Not coincidentally, the button promotion began in the early years of Paterno's position as head coach for PSU.  I'm from Nebraska - Cornhusker country - and know very little about football, but even I know that Paterno is an icon among college coaches.<br /><br />Featured with each button are game summaries, statistics, and memorable moments.  Even to a non-fan, these tidbits of trivia were enlightening.  In particular, I found the origins of Paterno's master plan for succeessful athletes to be of interest.  Paterno believed it possible and desirable for world class athletes to maintain academic integrity while playing football.  His holistic approach has been proven sound for almost four decades.  His three point philosophy is simple: teamwork, high academic standards, and personal responsibility are required to be a Nittany Lion.  Season by season, cycle by cycle, he applies his formula and philosohy for the long haul.  Paterno and the Lions may be bent from time to time but never broken for long.  Further commentary examines the Lions' Top 100 Games, and the team's up and down cycles, which in retrospect demonstrate a certain predictability.<br /><br />The authors and publisher arranged their book in large font and easy-to-read layout.  The collectible buttons were delightful.  No review would be complete without listing a few of my favorites, all of which were a sly play on words:<br /><br />Driving Mich Crazy -- PSU vs. Michigan 1997<br /><br />Crimson Cried -- PSU vs. Alabama 1989<br /><br />Irish Go Blah -- PSU vs. Notre Dame 1982<br /><br />Kick Wisconsin's Dairy Air -- PSU vs. Wisconsin 2003<br /><br />Get Reel, Virginia -- PSU vs. Virginia 2001<br /><br />For die hard Penn State fans this book is a must have, but it would be entertaining reading for both fans and foes.  Devotees of college football will enjoy the inside information and fascinating trivia.  Button collectors will have a field day.  And even those like me, who know nothing whatsoever about football, will be entertained by what the authors offer in this book.  It would make a wonderful gift for any sports fan you know.  Adding to its considerable appeal is the knowledge that a portion of the price of each book sold will benefit the Penn State Blue Band, cheerleaders, and dance team.xamines the Lions' Top 100 Games, and the team's up and down cycles, which in retrospect demonstrate a certain predictability. <br />  <br />The authors and publisher arranged their book in large font and easy-to-read layout.

Nothing remotely similar comes to mind.  My compliments to Ms. Bloyd.  The Five O'Clock Cake was intoxicating and irresistible.  I could not turn these pages fast enough.<br /><br />Set in Anderson Valley of the 1920s, Gramma Bess lives with one foot in a blossoming modern era and the other firmly planted in the past.  She rocks and crochets, reminiscing about her youth, tippling wine to calm her nerves and holding court in her mansion as family and friends pass through her world.  Bess is a memorable character.  She still rules her kingdom, and anyone who thinks otherwise is sadly mistaken.  Twenty years have passed, but she's never accepted that her forty year old son George married a fifteen year old Indian girl named Kittijo.  George is a good son and husband who works hard and seems rather dull to his young wife.  Gramma Bess suspects that Kittijo finds passion in the arms of a hired man, Duff, and doesn't mind voicing that suspicion to everyone she knows.<br /><br />From the beautiful valley Bess calls home, to the quirky folks who populate her life, this book is choice.  Rich with humor and subtle nuances of character development, this book is one of a kind.  Each chapter adds tasty details to the lives and characters as Gramma Bess, Kittijo, George, and Duff progress towards the satisfying climax of this tale.<br /><br />If you want something different, or are tired of the same old familiar fare, I recommend you read  The Five O'Clock Cake.	2004-09-06

Jenny firmly believes there can be no happiness, no love or romance, no happily ever after for her.  She knows eventually the murderer will come after her again.<br /><br />When Sam Conway shows up on her doorstep, Jenny knows the past has resurfaced.  Sam is a cop and friend from the time that Jenny almost died.  He comes with a horrifying message.  If she does not become the beautiful Genevieve again, the killer will murder one girl a week until she does.  Bodies have been turning up wrapped in plastic all over Florida.  Jenny can't live with causing any more deaths, and so she plays along with Sam.  Can Sam and Nick keep her alive while flushing out a demented serial killer?  Jenny doesn't think they can.<br /><br />The Butterfly Game was a chilling read.

Kelly Carrington-Monroe lives an impeccably ordered life, with two picture perfect kids and a controlling, inattentive husband.  She gets more affection from her dog Zeus than she does from any human in her life.  Kelly is an executive at Impact Music in New York.  She's always been uptight, all business, slightly shocked by the rock musicians she represents.  Secretly, she's often yearned for a bigger slice of life, and daydreams about finding true love and passion.  She's never considered acting on her daydreams until she finds her cold, condescending husband romping with their nanny.  Kelly files for divorce, then sets out to change her life.<br /><br />While arranging a national tour for the band Checkered Past, Kelly meets Brett Blaine, lead singer.  Brett is the quintessential bad boy and far more appealing than media hype makes him out to be.  Blessed with smoldering eyes and a roguish way with the ladies, Brett falls for Kelly from their first meeting.  He asks her to tour with the band as back up singer.  Before too long, Kelly discovers that elevator music and her cold fish husband Brad just don't cut it for her any more.<br /><br />While touring, Kelly learns the business as an insider.  Wild parties, alcohol and drugs to keep her going, and exhausting treks from one play date to another become her new reality.  Life on the road with Brett is intense, exciting, and sometimes frightening.  When a crazed stalker harms band members, Kelly's life is on the line.<br /><br />Wild Side is a tidy little thriller in addition to portraying the best and worst of fame's rewards.  Such a life is not all fun and frolic, and the author does a good job of showing both sides.  The language and sexual situations are graphic so the book is recommended for mature readers.  If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a famous rock band - warts and all - check this one out.	2004-09-03

Bailey has chosen a rather unusual premise for her first book, and perfected it most effectively.  Sam's Diary is an absorbing chronicle of family relationships and the daily lives that mesh together to form a loving unit.<br /><br />The Evers are a typical American family.  Father Brian is quiet, a good provider for his wife and children, slyly humorous and loving.  Mother Helen is feisty and outspoken, adoring of her husband and supportive of her children, laying down her rules with sardonic wit.  Son Dean is a loner who is into country music and competitive sports, a good student who has no steady girlfriend as the book begins.  Daughter Samantha - Sam - is a typical teenage girl who questions life, worries about her looks, and records her thoughts and hopes in a diary.  Life for the Evers family is not always perfect.  There are the usual clashes between mother and daughter, occasional financial concerns, and tempers flare from time to time.  Still, they function beautifully as a family unit and underlying every argument or misunderstanding there is a sometimes unspoken germ of love and respect.  Close friends add a rich reality and humor to their lives.<br /><br />Sam's thoughts, written in her diary, are the central focus as her mother reads each entry years later and adds her comments to the mix.  The results show a clear picture of how the Evers family interacts and works together towards solutions to each problem.  Far from being mundane, the entries and comments are often hilarious or profound.  The language is often graphic.  Each character immediately becomes a person readers care about.  Sam addresses the occasions most meaningful in her life --  drivers ed, first permanent, first date, first period, her jobs, shopping at the mall -- and does so with a starkly charming honesty.<br /><br />It's rare to find a book that stuns me to silence.  Sam's Diary accomplished that.  About three fourths of the way through I was happily reading along, enjoying myself immensely, when Ms. Bailey took me by complete surprise.  It will take me awhile to recover.<br /><br />I'll say no more, and not divulge the secret of Sam's Diary.  I recommend you read it for yourself.  Despite the sometimes graphic, honest language, mature teenagers and adults - especially parents - will be entertained and enlightened by this book.

His savings are depleted first, then he loses his vehicle, and finally after several months his apartment.  A quiet, unassuming man who always paid his own way is left standing on the street with everything he owns stuffed in a rolling duffel bag.  He turns to the Salvation Army and finds housing in an all male homeless shelter until he can regroup.  His hopes for the future are high.  He's intelligent and capable, after all, and surely this will be a temporary setback.<br /><br />Although he isn't a drug addict, alcoholic, or convicted felon, Argile is placed in a shelter warehousing such men.  Life in the shelter is structured by hard rules and domineering overseers.  Newfound friends make life bearable, but Argile soon begins to suffer from his losses.  The once productive self-sufficient member of society is plagued by anxiety and fear of the unknown.  Exhausted in body, mind, and spirit, he struggles to gain needed health care, permanent housing, and a paying job.  When Argile is transferred to a homeless shelter for honorably discharged veterans, he trusts that life will soon turn in his favor.  What he discovers there is danger from violent residents and cruel, injust treatment at the hands of those paid to serve the homeless.  Overwhelmed caseworkers try to distance themselves from the hopeless souls they should be serving.  Psychiatric teams have as their only goals maintaining power and control.  Suffering from bleeding ulcers and contemplating suicide, Argile leaves that second shelter in desperation.  Even life on the street is preferable to injustice and harassment.<br /><br />With dignity and scathing honesty, Argile writes his story on the laptop purchased in his pre-homeless life.  Writing is a purgative and calming exercise.  The message he delivers is clear:  Don't take for granted the small pleasures and blessings in life because millions of decent Americans are one or two paychecks away from homelessness.<br /><br />In closing, I must stand in agreement with points made retrospectively by the author.  America has lost the war on drugs, poverty, domestic violence, mental illness, and homelessness.  Until our elected officials turn their attention away from funding problems overseas, they cannot address dire social problems within our borders.  This book is a sobering commentary on social problems  esixting long before 9/11 and the current economy.  I suggest you read this book, if you have the courage.ve as their only goals maintaining power and control.

US	36398642	R2DUWLC5WVO3KK	097527113X	650382957	The Sultan	Books	5	3	4	N	N	well written fiction - highest recommendation	My first impression of this fine book was positive, thanks to the spectacular cover art.  Ancient warriors in battle, horses at a gallop, stand out in colorful relief against a faded map of Arabia.  That cover sets the tone for The Sultan, so T.J. Koll's skill as writer came as no surprise.  From page one, I was hooked.<br /><br />The ongoing troubles in Israel, Desert Storm, 9/11, and now the war in Iraq -- via TV -- have set our national perspective on the Arab world in stone.  T.J. Koll takes us back in time, brings to life a new, enlightened picture of the Muslim people and their struggles.  With honesty and compassion, the author shows us both sides of a battle that has raged for centuries and will likely never end.  The Sultan may be fiction, but to this reader at least every word rang true.<br /><br />We meet Youssuf Salah al-Din when he is a youth, watching his warrior-father die in battle at the hands of Christian Crusaders.  Youssuf is Syrian, a Kurd, who vows revenge on the red haired knight who killed his father.  Youssuf is a peaceful man who tries to live by the Qu-ran.  He despises butchery and battle but is forced by circumstance to become a warrior.  Ferocious in battle and blessed by Allah with a canny intelligence, Youssuf soon earns grudging respect from the Christian Knights occupying his homeland.  They call him Saladin.<br /><br />Bloody skirmishes are fought with crossbows, scimitars, swords and spears.  From Syria, to Egypt, and finally Jerusalem, Youssuf proves his skill and cunning against superior Christian forces.  Jerusalem is the prize coveted by both Muslims and Christians.  Youssuf must deal with politics and treacheries as both sides posture, quarrel and grapple for dominance.  The Europeans understand that dividing ancient Arab foes will weaken their enemy.  They play Egypt and Syria against each other as a means of furthering Vatican interests.  Youssuf understands this and labors to maintain unity between the Arab nations.<br /><br />Along with realistic depictions of bloody battles, Koll beautifully describes the quiet of holy places and the sting of desert sand.  His characters are richly developed and believable.  The best and worst of both sides is honestly detailed.  All knights are not blinded by hatred.  All Muslims are not bent on killing every Christian.  There are men of honor on both sides.  Both Youssuf and a sympathetic knight he befriends -- Count Tripoli -- have a clear understanding of the fight between two faiths:  Neither God nor Allah have a part in the miseries inflicted on humanity in their names.  Man alone must bear that responsibility.<br /><br />T. J. Koll's first book is a winner.  His writing style is a joy to read.

Foertmeyer excels at spinning adventure yarns blended with fantasy, friendship, and poetic justice.  His eighth novel, a sequel to his first, creates a sense of wonder that builds from first page to last.<br /><br />In 1968, Kevin Reynolds was convicted of a horrible crime, was eventually executed, taking important information to his grave. The Caldera begins in 2003 when Mitch Reynolds shares a recently discovered secret with his lifelong friend Spence Doogan.  Spence is dubious, until Mitch offers proof that may explain the tragic happenings in 1968.  The teenagers enlist another friend, Kody Coates, to investigate new information about the tragedy.  Kody also has a vested interest in discovering the truth about what happened at the Oriel Peak Caldera so many years ago.  A Coates relative was murdered back then, and to this day what happened there has never been explained.  The three friends devise a plan to search for answers.<br /><br />Even scenic vistas of the glorious Montana Rockies can't disguise the sense that all is not right in the Caldera.  Time and place become distorted.  Maybe Indian magic gone awry explains it, or perhaps Heaven is righting earthly wrongs by leveling the playing field?  Whatever the explanation, the three friends soon find themselves embroiled in a far larger mystery than they expected.  Sam Elliott, the ancient mountain man from another era, stalks them with his Sharps.  Or is it really Sam?  Odd winds blow across the caldera, accompanied by violent rumblings in the earth.  When all three boys go missing, Sheriff Casey Jeffries and retired Deputy Stan Phillips search for answers and find much more than they anticipated.  Will past wrongs be righted and final justice prevail?  You'll have to read the story to find out.<br /><br />In each novel, C.H. Foertmeyer always presents an intriguing concept for readers to consider.  His characters are believable and well developed.  Wilderness descriptions add richness to each story.  The Caldera is exceptional in that respect.  Past, present, and future become living entities as powers beyond human comprehension work to solve a long hidden mystery.

A colleague said, \\"If you like Keeler's writing, you should read his poetry.\\"  I followed through on that advice.  Keeler's book of poetry, Epiphany at Goofy's Gas is a gem.<br /><br />Greg Keeler wears a lot of hats.  Musician, lyricist, writer, poet, satirist and educator are among his accomplishments.  As poet, his work is never predictable or trite.  I laughed out loud at his humorous sleight-of-hand one minute, and found myself blinking back tears the next.<br /><br />Keeler excels at sly humor.  His\\"Memo to Blue Gnats\\" is priceless:<br /><br />  We are writing to request<br /><br />  a thorough and precise<br /><br />  accounting for this behavior<br /><br />  since, under standard procedures,<br /><br />  you are supposed to be dead.<br /><br />Ditto his \\"Memo to The Hornets\\":<br /><br />  Those of you who happened<br /><br />  to be away at 10:00 A.M.<br /><br />  will notice that your nest<br /><br />  and your colleagues are missing.<br /><br />I was still contemplating the memoes while reading his seven part anthem, \\"The Meat.\\"  Believe me, this is social commentary and satire on the highest order.  A hint regarding content can be found in the first three lines:<br /><br />  Once more the meat converges on<br /><br />  Atlantic City for the annual selection<br /><br />  of the meatiest of the meat.<br /><br />But Keeler's work is more than simply caustic satire and sly self-examination.  He also provides moments of rare beauty, as found in two lines of a poem about his dying grandmother in \\"Grandma Wulz\\":<br /><br />  ...there is more grace in this flesh than death<br /><br />  could possibly know....<br /><br />And the musings of a lonely woman in \\"The Fisherman's Wife\\" brought a crush of empathetic understanding:<br /><br />  Don't think of the garden unplanted<br /><br />  or the stars unseen when dawn comes.<br /><br />  I've trailed my footprints<br /><br />  like obsolete currency<br /><br />  down the sand<br /><br />  where you left me so often.<br /><br />In between the laughter and lumps in the throat, Keeler dangles clear cut visions of joy then snatches them away via contrasting moments of reality.  I've heard it said the mark of a good wordsmith is that their words haunt readers long after the book has been read.  Greg Keeler's work more than qualifies if Epiphany at Goofy's Gas is an example.ght a crush of empathetic understanding: <br />                Don't think of the garden unplanted <br />                or the stars unseen when dawn comes. <br />                I've trailed my footprints <br />                like obsolete currency <br />                down the sand <br />                where you left me so often. <br />  <br />In between the laughter and lumps in the throat, Keeler dangles clear cut visions of joy then snatches them away via contrasting moments of reality.

Mazur once again shines a revealing spotlight on human frailties and prejudices.  The characters are well-defined and real, the sort we know or meet each day.  This fictional story is a chilling one, because it could very well be true.<br /><br />Out of early morning fog, a sniper cuts down two hunters on the first day of buck season.  Why? is the question locals ask each other.  Sagerville PA is a tiny enclave, tucked into pristine forest and mountain terrain.  This is God's country, hunters' paradise.  Hunters boost the local economy and have been Sagerville's bread and butter for decades.  Who would want to kill off hunters?<br /><br />Meredith Tome is the local newspaper editor.  All journalistic fight and fire went out of him when he spoke the truth and faced a lawsuit in return.  Everyone from the local druggist and realtor to the DA advise Tome to play down his coverage of the murders.  After all, scaring off thousands of deer hunters is not in Sagerville's best interests.  Tome does as they ask, and soon a third hunter dies.  Everyone is suspect, especially inhabitants of a shanty town called The Buckseller and a group of activists called Friends of God's Creatures.<br /><br />As locals work together in their hunt for a killer, we see the essence of small town America - the friendly rivalries, petty jealousies, the bark and bite of prejudice and gossip, and the endless quest for economic stability.  Mazur writes in a confident style.  The Buckseller is literary fiction, with mystery and murder thrown in for good measure.	2004-07-13

Every page reflects her irrepressible personailty and strength.  In the foreword by U.S. Surgeon General (Retired) C. Everett Koop, he states that Heidi has &quot;rubbed shoulders with the great and near great.&quot;  Still, it's clear that she has not allowed friendships and professional associations with presidents and senators to change her basic outlook.<br /><br />Heidi grew up poor in the forties.  Admittedly, her childhood was far from being Utopia.  From one failed attempt at farming to another, her hard working step father and less-than-nurturing mother struggled to make ends meet.  Heidi was a precocious child, curious with a vivid imagination.  Her clothes and hair were often unkempt; their homes had no running water or electricity so cleanliness was not a priority.  But Heidi made straight As in school and took great pride in every accomplishment.  Good grades earned her paid scholarships to nursing school.  Heidi excelled in nursing school, despite a disastrous first marriage, and took life firmly by the horns soon after passing R.N. state boards.<br /><br />The adult Heidi is intelligent, erudite, an adventuresome spirit, risk-taker, adept manager, devoted wife to her second husband.....and alcoholic.  True to form, she takes on the world and climbs the ladder of success while battling a dependency on alcohol.  Her husband is a respected Neuropsychiatrist  appointed to responsible positions in both the public and private sector.  First Governor, then President Reagan is his friend.  It's during the Reagan years that Heidi and her husband gain important positions in Washington D.C.  Their work takes them around the world as they circulate with potentates and kings.  But it's her determined struggle for sobriety that this reader will remember.<br /><br />Heidi Redux is an amazing journey.  The author takes us with her from stark childhood to policy maker in the rarefied air of Washington D.C. to her  retirement in the present day.  Along the way, as we see the world through her eyes, she shares her thoughts on such profound subjects as the causes and effects of our failed mental health system and the labyrinthine workings of government and military spending.<br /><br />The author shares her life with forthright humor.  She doesn't mince words or make excuses.  Heidi simply tells it like it is with fast-paced prose and keeps on trucking.  Hers is a fascinating story, well told, and deserving of a wide audience.

Benjamin's Bride is no exception.<br /><br />Patricia Collingsworth - called Mouse - is a determined young woman who excels at everything she does.  Despite that intelligence and drive, knowledge brings no comfort.  She rues her mousy looks, resents her human foibles and imperfections, and sometimes questions God's influence in her life.  Her skill and foresight is put to the test one cold night on a deserted road in Colorado.  She's overcome by men assigned to find their youngest brother a wife.  In a remote compound in the Colorado wilderness, Mouse encounters evil of the foulest kind.<br /><br />Jacob Israel rules The Children of Israel with threats and cruelty in an Old Testament patriarchy.  His word is law.  Punishments for defying him vary from death by stoning to whipping.  All Jacob's wives and children fear his wrath, for good reason.  Jacob is evil personified, a self-appointed prophet who believes the Lord provides for him in many ways, most of them illegal.  Mexican drug cartels, Arab arms dealers, and the Russian mafia are all used by Jacob to line his pockets and increase his power base world wide.<br /><br />Benjamin Israel is Jacob's youngest son.  Jacob's cruelty and vile practices sicken him.  He's been biding his time in silence, refusing to participate in group stonings and other tortures.  Ben doubts the existence of a kindly God and is determined to escape.  When the drugged and manhandled Mouse is forced to marry him in one of Jacob's sham ceremonies, Ben vows to save them both or die trying.<br /><br />From that point the danger and action escalate non stop.  Ben and Mouse escape during a blinding blizzard.  As they struggle to survive, both learn the true meaning of love - both God's and man's.  Will prayers of protection by Christian believers save them?  And will Colorado Bureau of Investigation agent Bob Barnes and his friend Father O'Flagherty find the young couple aliive?<br /><br />Benjamin's Bride is an exciting and satisfying read.

Every word of praise is richly deserved.  This is an amazing first book by a gifted writer.  The characters are fully developed, the prose pure and natural.  Mr. Grace is a born storyteller.<br /><br />By chance, Mike and Walter have formed an unlikely friendship.  Mike is physically strong and healthy.  His father taught him how to fish, fight, and ski at a young age.  He's living on an inheritance received following the death of his parents.  Mike is not emotionally invested in his marriage and refuses to get a job.  Walter has been physically and mentally impaired by a head injury, but in many ways he sees life more clearly than Mike.  Despite debilitating seizures and motor impairments, Walter holds down a full time job and struggles to maintain what independence he has left.  Once handsome, hopeful, and whole, Walter now calls himself &quot;broken.&quot;  His mother is dead; his father refuses to acknowledge him.  His friendship with Mike provides the acceptance and camaraderie Walter craves.  He's astute enough to recognize that both men are broken in their own way.<br /><br />Their story is revealed in increments as the men hike, fish and ski the wilderness areas of Wyoming, Utah and Idaho.  Mike watches over Walter with a poignant tenderness and concern while gently prodding him beyond physical limits.  He does not baby Walter, but treats him like a man and equal.  In turn, Walter's sly observances of life, his drive to find love, adventure, and independence inspire Mike to examine his own short comings.<br /><br />Under Cottonwoods is inspiring without being maudlin, exciting but not contrived.  Wilderness areas are beautifully described in well drawn prose other writers may envy.  You don't have to be a fly fisherman or outdoorsman to enjoy this one.  If you appreciate a good story, enhanced by excellent writing, this book is a must read.  It has my highest recommendation.	2004-06-26

Far-Seer  is a parable without equal.<br /><br />Afsan is a simple country saurian, chosen as apprentice to Master Astrologer Tak-Saleed.  Afsan enjoys the tranquility and peace of the night sky, entertains solitary thoughts of mysteries, and faces life with gentle humor despite his hunter's instincts.  Afsan's world is one of landquakes and erupting volcanoes.  His species is Quintaglio - meat eating dinosaurs.  Afsan's destiny is set long before his birth.<br /><br />If you believe it's impossible to sympathize with a dinosaur, think again.  You'll be drawn into Afsan's life as I was, experiencing each rite of Quintaglio passage: the thrill of the hunt; his first ocean voyage to see the Face of God; his first encounter with a female.  And you'll share his wonder while examining the heavens through a far-seer (telescope); his joy at proving the earth round; his horror when all signs point to the destruction of the world Quintaglios call home.<br /><br />Robert Sawyer makes it all so real.  This is a touching story, personable and intimate and thrilling.  The saurian characters are believable as they struggle with the hypocrisies and territorial instincts of civilization.  I can scarcely wait to read Books Two and Three.	2004-06-26

The Richest of Fare changed that ill-informed idea.  Blending scientific fact, spiritual truths, and stunning photographs with thoughtful prose, the author has created beauty for our senses.  Visually appealing and emotionally comforting, this book is one you'll want to keep.<br /><br />In ages past, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed all sought spiritual renewal in the desert.  Stark beauty,  blessed silence, and the awesome nighttime sky drew them closer to God's message.  On a daily basis, modern man has been estranged from the natural world.  Artificial lighting prevents city dwellers from seeing the stars.  Concrete and sprawling subdivisions separate us from earth's spirit.  We sense an isolation; wonder at a feeling of indifference; and struggle unsuccessfully to create a finer meaning for our existence.  America, especially, the richest and most blessed of all countries, is floundering.  To paraphrase Thoreau, civilization has improved our houses but not the men who inhabit them.  This richest country in the world boasts 44 million uninsured citizens; 10 million illegal immigrants; 9 million unemployed; and 4 million homeless souls.  Something is wrong with this picture and Ms. Strupp makes a compelling argument in explanation.<br /><br />Quotes by Thoreau, Francis of Assisi, H.G. Wells, Marcus Aurelius, Charles Darwin and others are combined with Old and New Testament writings to make her point.  Poetic metaphors enhance Ms. Strupp's well-written prose.  In the desert monsoon season, &quot;air clings to you like a desperate beggar.&quot;  Runoff deposits after a hard desert rain become &quot;little shards of eternity.&quot;  Earth has been transformed by warring humans into &quot;a sponge to sop up blood.&quot;  Those who plunder Earth like a commercial commodity are &quot;spoiled children betraying their mother.&quot;  The writing, photographs, and well-chosen quotes create a spiritual picture I won't soon forget.<br /><br />The Richest of Fare is not a &quot;religious&quot; book  It's spiritually encouraging, emotionally comforting, informative and educational.  It may impact how you look at life, your fellow man, the desert and the cosmos.  This one is highly recommended for readers who are searching for true meaning in their lives.forget.<BR> <BR>The Richest of Fare is not a &quot;religious&quot; book   It's spiritually encouraging, emotionally comforting, informative and educational.

Hall's second book of fiction features Nebraska grasslands and insightful characters.  Her prose is beautifully crafted, drawing readers into the wonders of tall grass prairies and the hardy settlers who claimed the land.<br /><br />The year is 1868.  Life on the Nebraska prairies can be daunting, but Iris Stratton and Andrew Burgess cannot conceive of life without each other or their glorious grasslands in every season.  Iris is beautiful and reckless, tender and strong like the prairies from which she sprang.  Andrew hails from Boston, but loves the untamed prairies almost as much as he loves Iris.  They vow to marry and make a life together in Nebraska.  The prairies can do strange things to people.  Some it shapes into a finer person, while others it hardens into meanness.  Leo Branson wants Iris for his wife and does not care how far he has to go or who he has to kill to get her.<br /><br />Entwined within this tender love story and paean to prairie life is a touching mystery from Iris's past.  The mystery is revealed when Iris finds long forgotten objects in the attic, and with a cryptic message spoken by her father during illness:  &quot;...the ivy on the wall.&quot;<br /><br />Ms. Hall is a natural story teller.  I loved her first book and said it was a &quot;must have, must read.&quot;  If anything, her writing has improved and matured with Winds Across the Prairie.  To those who appreciate a well told tale of any type, this one is recommended.	2004-05-30

He and Sock Monkey Blues are one of a kind.\\"  Well, now I must amend that statement.  As writer, he is one of a kind and the second in his Joe Box series is equal to the first.  Until the Last Dog Dies has that special something, which is a unique story well told by an excellent wordsmith.<br /><br />Joseph Jebstuart Box - Joe to his friends - is a true Kentucky gentleman with a somewhat dicey past.  His job as private investigator in and around Cincinnati barely keeps food on the table and a roof over his head.  Only a few months past a case that nearly killed him, Joe's life is a \\"train wreck\\", but he's beginning to see a light at the end of his tunnel.  His rough life is behind him; he's begun a hopeful Christian walk; and the lonely widower has a new woman in his life.  With wry, self-effacing humor and down home realism, Joe faces his future with hope.  And then the members of his combat team from Vietnam begin to turn up dead.<br /><br />As Joe says, duty and honor are inextricably bound to Dixie's sons.  He's duty bound to ferret out the killer of his combat brothers.  As his investigation into each death progresses, a familiar evil horror is revealed.  Robinson skillfully weaves vignettes from combat days in Vietnam with present day occurences as we learn who's killing veterans and why.  Joe may be new to Christianity, but he knows only God's power can protect him from pure evil.  He's in this battle until the last dog dies, and if that dog is him then so be it.<br /><br />Robinson is a masterful story teller.  His characters are well-developed and charismatic, the suspense hair raising.  Like the author, Joe Box has what it takes.  He is a Christian and makes no bones about it.  But he's a tough Christian who takes on evil with power and panache.  The Joe Box series gets my highest recommendation.	2004-05-30

Dark and quirky humor coupled with quixotic characters adds to the surprising mix found in The Last Dinosaurs.<br /><br />27 year old Daniella Carlier is a naieve architecture student living and working in Puerto Rico.  Her ex-husband Ismael is a starving artist turned art critic turned hotel owner now married to a much older woman not-so-fondly known as Lady Dracula.  Daniella and her new boyfriend Tony share a small studio apartment with her beloved Turkish cat.  Despite his use of several illegal drugs, Tony is a gorgeous male animal, another starving artist who will soon become the new wunderkind of art connosieurs.  Daniella often wonders how she got involved with such an unusual group of people, likening those around her to carnivores from the Mesozoic era - dinosaurs who gobble up everyone and everything in their wake.<br /><br />Several odd mysteries are threaded through Daniella's everyday life.  Ismael's elderly rich wife looks more like vampire than woman as she struggles to regain her youth by unusual means.  Someone dubbed El Zorro is terrorizing Puerto Rican women who wear mini skirts by carving Zs in their behinds.  And strange happenings at Ismael's specialty hotel leave Daniella troubled.  These mysteries and assorted plot twists are guaranteed to keep readers guessing until the last page.<br /><br />The Last Dinosaurs may well be one of a kind as stories go.  I've never read a book remotely like it.  Everything from the humorously weird to the acutely macabre can be found between these covers, and then some.  It may not be fare for sensitive adolescents and adults, but there is no bad language or explicit sex.  If you're tired of the same old genre fiction, consider giving this one a try.	2004-05-30

Set in modern day Wyoming, the author drew me into his milieu from page one and kept me there throughout.<br /><br />Bailey Calhoun is a Bureau of Land Management investigator, ex-marine, and ex-cop with a temper.  Life has him by the short hairs.  He's sick of the system, courts, lawyers, and the stock market has eaten his savings alive.  Except for his wife Dana, he has more compassion for animals than he does people.  When herds of wild horses turn up slaughtered, shot from a distance for no apparent reason, Bailey goes on a rampage.  He drinks too much; his job and marriage hang in the balance; but all he can think about is catching the scum responsible for killing horses.<br /><br />Bailey loves his Wyoming home, the high plains and mountains and their wide open feel, the wild horses roaming free.  When Dana leaves him, he channels his suffocated emotions into rage at a world gone beyond his control.  His investigation reveals conspiracy and corporate greed at its worst.  One shocking revelation after another threatens everything he holds dear, including the lives of Dana and his friends.  Bailey vows to bring the bad guys down, or die trying.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and believable, the sense of place first rate.  Can Horses Cry? is a fine first book.  Bring on another, Mr. Paul.	2004-05-04

The location is Goteborg Sweden.  Karl Lind is an intelligent, idealistic young man with a strong work ethic.  Despite his life of wealth and privilege, he has no desire to be counted among the idle rich.  Karl loves his job working for his father's newspaper, and accepts with humor his family's urging to live a rich man's life.  Lively discussions of philosophical beliefs and religious mores are common around the dinner table and Karl participates with relish.<br /><br />The chance meeting of a hedonistic girl with atheistic leanings casts a pall on Karl's life.  The first rush of sexual excitement is soon replaced by boredom and dislike for Bertha and her ways.  By then she's pregnant and he's forced by moral beliefs into a marriage he cannot stomach.  It's downhlll all the way from there.  When Bertha establishes a lesbian attachment to her friend Christine, not even Karl's devotion to his son is enough to salvage his idealism.  Bertha and Christine plot to ruin Karl through vicious lies and sly rumors.  They won't be satisfied until he's lost everything, including his family, money and sanity.<br /><br />In Love and Madness, David Rehak shows a good man's rapid fall from grace.  It's a dark period piece, a commentary on the past that remains a dire warning for this present day.  \\"Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.\\"	2004-05-04

Christening the Dancer is Amen's first published book of poetry, but his poems have appeared in many periodicals and he is a Pushcart Prize nominee.  The breathtaking cover of this book reflects his talent as an artist, while the poems inside represent the cadences of a natural musician.  The website he founded - The Pedestal Magazine - has a class and style all its own.  This is a man who appreciates and extols the beautiful in life, despite the psychic pain and rage that drive him.<br /><br />I empathize and rejoice when a poet struggles to express the inexpressible.  The figurative emasculation of modern males is a recurring theme throughout, as are hints of family dysfunction.  There have been &quot;too many hungry hands in private places&quot;, sometimes extinguishing adult desire.  Spirit and joy are often desiccated by fear and disappointment, as we end up &quot;passing like ghosts through marriages and jobs.&quot;  I understood when Amen says, &quot;I began murdering myself for a living.&quot;  And I sympathized with his stunning expressions of impotent acceptance:<br />  One thing I am sure of,<br />  even if the Sphinx's riddle is solved,<br />  I will still be devoured.<br /><br />John Amen's words speak to and for a society forced to live in a world not entirely of our making:<br />  God is leading me down<br />  a dirt road of madness<br />  toward an abandoned town called sanity.<br /><br />This one is a keeper.	2004-05-04

Foertmeyer spins a tale of friendship and courage within a maelstrom of disguised reality.  Past, present, and future blend into a kaleidoscopic view of parallel worlds.<br /><br />Scott Franklin and Denny Miller are childhood friends, grown to adulthood.  While on their annual fall hunting trip, their lives are changed forever.  Deep within the Huevos, along the Rio Hondo, Scott spies a cave and suggests the friends explore it.  When Denny enters the cave and disappears, both men begin a shocking and exciting journey back in time.<br /><br />Denny is transported to a place both frightening and wonderful, to the American west of 1874.  This is a land without modern conveniences and communication, a land before telephone poles. TV and asphalt highways.  What he sees is an almost pristine west, in a time before expanding civilization soiled the land.<br /><br />Trapped back in our present time, Scott discovers Moon Cave holds a special place in ancient Indian beliefs.  In hopes of discovering a way to rescue Denny, he consults a Mescal Indian shaman, Cha-tah-wa.  The path back through time is not easy and holds many dangers, but Scott and Cha-tah-wa discover a key to the past.<br /><br />Together again in the past, Scott and Denny face down the savage tribes who still believe the white man can be defeated.  They explore the old west with delightful curiosity, thankful for the opportunity to see living history first hand.  They are befriended by Custer, Sacajawea's grandson, and other famous Indian warriors of the time.  Soon they are assmiliated into the past, forgetting what life was like before Moon Cave and their time warping transition.  Cha-tah-wa is their only hope of escaping from the past,  but the Mescal shaman has his own problems.  Will he succeed?<br /><br />Moon Cave is escapist fiction at its best.  The author's vivid imagination and writing style make for mystery and excitement.  Despite some strong language and violence - the sort you'd find in any old west saga - this is an exciting tale for adult readers of any age.find in any old west saga - this is an exciting tale for adult readers of any age.	2004-04-19

Past accomplishments include Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder;  Live Fast-Die Young: Remembering the Short Life of James Dean; and Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie and the Family.  In his tenth novel, the author shows us Hollywood Boulevard of the present day.  With unblinking honesty, Gilmore reveals tinseltown's raw truths.  It's not all glitter.<br /><br />Eli Woodrow is divorced, living alone in a tiny apartment, pursuing his dreams at a snail's pace.  In a world of auras, zodiac signs, and the fast deal, Eli is a quiet straight arrow.  He knows his world is garbage and accepts it.  His gift as a photographer has been mostly lost in the shuffle.  The closest he has come to fame is the porn films he shoots, but his hopes are pinned on the coffee table book of photos shot on Hollywood Boulevard.  Through his eyes, the pimps and prostitutes, drug addicts, transients, and bottom feeders along the boulevard become grist for the camera's lens.  When Shana Sands crosses his path, she's like a dream come true for the lonely Eli.<br /><br />Shana Sands is the epitome of Hollywood beauty.  Blonde, with a figure to die for, Eli is captivated by her from day one.  She has a childlike vulnerability he finds endearing, and an unselfconscious sexuality that possesses him completely.  And best of all, Shana wants him in her life.  She talks of love, of having babies and making a home together in the Hollywood hills.  Even when his dream girl turns out to be a nightmare, Eli stays hooked.  Trying to follow Shana's flight of ideas in every conversation is exhausting.  She spends money like water.  Suffering from narcolepsy and catalepsy, she conks out at the most inopportune times you can imagine, and is addicted to so many medications Eli loses count.  And that is just the tip of the iceberg.  As their relationship progresses, Eli discovers that Shana's beautiful appearance hides a selfish, faithless woman.<br /><br />True love and solace is eventually found in the person of Joey, aka Joy, a long time friend of Eli's.  It's a most unlikely union - the heterosexual Eli and transsexual Joy - but somehow it works out for the best.<br /><br />There was a lesson to be gained in Hollywood Boulevard:  Along the boulevard, some people remain true to what they've always been in their heart, but most lose the dream and their humanity in the bargain.  Beneath the Hollywood glamour, always, is the grit and smog, but sometimes those with strength and hope rise above it.

I purposely procrastinated and did not intend to review it.  After all, what can any reviewer of humble origin say about an international best seller that received rave reviews from every major review source in the world? Any possible superlative has already been applied.<br /><br />We meet Briony Tallis when she is an imaginative 13 year old in 1935.  Her thought processes are frenetic; she's a secretive adolescent with &quot;a strange mind and a facility with words.&quot;  Her inexperience visits a horrible injustice on Robbie Turner, decent and gifted son of a Tallis family servant.  Robbie has grown up with the Tallis children.  Despite his lower class standing, he falls in love with the elder daughter Cecilia.  That affection is mutual, until Briony mixes in.  She tells an awful lie about Robbie that has heart sickening results, then spends the rest of her life trying to atone.<br /><br />McEwan captures perfectly a time and place, and the class distinctions that set his characters apart.  The Tallis clan is wealthy, impatient, bored, restless.  Robbie Turner is intelligent, loyal and confident, with focused plans for a grand future that fails because of Briony's cunning lie.<br /><br />Atonement is a beautifully written but grim story of injustice.  It speaks to wrongs that can never be reversed down through the generations, and portrays a slice of life that is not always sweet or palatable.  Briony atones for her self serving lie, but was it enough?<br /><br />Atonement is written in the late 19th and early 20th century style.  McEwan's vocabulary is expansive, his prose wonderfully crafted.  Readers of literary fiction will appreciate his work.	2004-04-11

God blessed her with healing gifts that would take half a lifetime to reach fruition.  Because of her gifts, the author has lost companionship with family members and friends.  Some considered her a crackpot at the least.  Others accused her of doing &quot;the devil's work.&quot;  These are losses she grieves, yet must accept for the greater good of those who need her.<br /><br />Because she believed that all good and perfect gifts are of God,  Ms. Rose persevered and embraced his healing spirit.  It takes tremendous courage to say what you mean and stand behind it.  This is especially true in a society that oftentimes fears or reviles what they cannot see or touch.  Still, the author stands her ground and applies her gifts of healing in a suffering world.<br /><br />Mary-Margareht Rose believes that humans are not simply inconsequential specks of dust, that we hold great importance in the universe.  At her side through every healing are powerful Ascended Masters:  Christ of Nazareth, his Mother Mary and Father Joseph, and beneficent extraterrestrial beings.  I mention here only a few of her well documented successes:<br />she understands the root causes of physical and psychic pain;<br />she has gained enlightenment into causative factors of excessive weight;<br />she understands and can apply the healing energy of water and exercise.<br /><br />By tapping into the Source of all healing power, the author has broken free of a troubled past.  Mary-Margareht overcame great odds.  The Courage to Be Who I Am is just the beginning of her journey.	2004-04-07

This time around, her message is delivered through a sly, seriocomic storyline.<br /><br />CoCo Bernstein heads south to escape New York cold - cold weather, cold feet, cold heart,  and a marriage that frosted over years ago.  As a fiftyish divorcee in Florida, CoCo begins a journey of self discovery beyond anything she could imagine.  She's intelligent, savvy, and determined to succeed on her own.  And then Ralph Leavitt comes along to skew her focus.<br /><br />Ralph Leavitt is man of indeterminate age, well past his prime.  His self-described entrepreneurial skills are questionable.  And his personal appearance is anything but appealing.  CoCo tells herself he's crude and coarse, a cheap and unappealing penny pincher.  And yet, from their first meeting, CoCo is inexplicably drawn to him sexually.  Ralph tells her she's a goddess, and treats her like a ravishingly beautiful, desirable woman.  His sex drive knows no bounds, and his skills as a lover open CoCo up to a whole new world of pissibilities.  Despite his senior citizen status, let's face it, Ralph is a sexual dynamo.  CoCo soon finds herself addicted to the carnal pleasures Ralph delivers with amazing regularity.<br /><br />As always, Ms. Daniels delivers a variety of intriguing and thought provoking surprises.  CoCo's path to enlightenment is strewn with odd and endearing charlatans and friends as this mature woman's love life sizzles and steams.  And by the end of the story, everyone reaps the karma they have sown.  This one is honest, quirky and sublime.  Recommended to mature readers due to strong sexual content and adult language.	2004-04-07

The underlying principles are sound, based on the simple rules of universal love and acceptance.<br /><br />There is more to us as humans than others can see with their eyes.  And there is more to our world than we have been taught to believe.  Buried deep within our mind and spirit is an awesome power, the ability to heal ourselves and others.  Mark Earlix' teachings exemplify that healing process.<br /><br />Have you missed a sens of purpose in your life, or yearned for abilities that always seem to stay beyond your reach?  Do you feel as if your life has lost its joy, and that your health on a downhill slide?  The few simple exercises described in this book - through non physical means that anyone can learn - could lead to a profound metamorphosis.<br /><br />Earlix shares his own personal odyssey and what he has learned over decades as a healer.  He believes that the origins of disease begin with the mental, move to the emotional, and end with the physical.  In other words, we sabotage our own well being with our thoughts.  Traumas in the form of energy inhabit us at the cellular level.  Our lives lose integrity as we become victim to self created dramas and traumas.  The author teaches us to shake off fear and negative thoughts to expedite the healing process.<br /><br />Earlix practices from the viewpoint that we are all healers.  But Healer is not a New Age technique you'll find impossible to grasp or perfect in the real world.  He believes that our every word, thought, and action is a living prayer.  His teachings are comforting and compassionate.  Mark Earlix loves his fellow human beings and wants to share a knowledge that will lessen our pain.  It's as simple as that.  If you are suffering physical or psychic pain, or know someone who is, perhaps you'll find a healing in this book.	2004-04-07

It's definitely not a Left Behind Series clone, and both story and writing are fresh and exhilarating.<br /><br />Jonathan Ladd, USN Retired, is about to embark on the mother of all missions.  His life as a black ops specialist has left him jaded and cynical. Everywhere he looks is corruption, hopelessness, and desapir.  A few powerful men with deep pockets have developed technology that will wipe out most of mankind instead of creating the needed healing and renaissance.  His long time friendship with Max Draco has been ripped to shreds by an unthinkable abomination.  Only his love for Johanna Starling eases Jonathan, and even that blessing is tenuous.  Then, through a mysterious discovery from ancient times, Jonathan discovers the answers to questions that have haunted mankind since time began.<br /><br />He is unexpectedly propelled into a future world of time travel and telepathy, to Earth as God intended it to be.  Seas are radiant with life.  Earth itself is pristine, with oxygen rich air and pure, sweet water.  To the battle weary Jonathan, all is primordial perfection.  Earth's inhabitants are loving and compassionate.  He sees wonders beyond human comprehension, learns awe inspiring secrets from the past.  And finally the  hardened warrior from Earth's sullied past becomes the savior of his world, destined to encounter evil personified.<br /><br />Michael Silverhawk has spent a lifetime searching for the face of God.  Our human history has wandered far afield of God's plan for His world.  Life as we know it has become skewed and manipulated for nefarious reasons.  The U.S. especially has veered off the path intended by her founders.  Drifters shows us both sides of the coin - what was, is, and could be again with love and compassion as the key.  The key that unlocks human potential is hidden within the Drifters trilogy.  I recommend you hitch a ride on this adventure.  Volume One is just the beginning.you hitch a ride on this adventure.

She listens to his music, composed one note on top of another until he reached a glorious symmetry - much like their life together.  His is a powerful and lingering presence that defies death.<br /><br />Christina's memories are a delightful read, despite the sobering subject.

And we devour stories of the rich and famous and their exploits.  Ms. Anderson's true stories of eight everyday women was a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />She chose for her subjects eight women from widely disparate walks of life.  The common thread that bound them all together was the plain and simple courage each one had in the face of adversity.  Some were from backgrounds of privilege, others from poverty.  Some had long and happy marriages, others suffered sorrow and betrayal at the hands of faithless husbands.<br /><br />Through interviews and family histories, the author skillfully reveals the heart and spirit of each woman  She slowly draws out their hopes and dreams, crushing losses, failed aspirations, and victories won through sheer will and determination.  It makes for an inspiring read, knowing that in the end such women persevered no matter what and came out winners.<br /><br />Each reader will relate to one or more of these women and their lives.  Courage in High Heels would make a wonderful subject for discussion groups or book clubs.  To simplify such discussions, the author has included appropriate questions to explore.  Women, in particular, will enjoy this book but there's something in it everyone can appreciate.  True courage never goes out of style.	2004-03-17

This early 20th century classic is as fresh and meaningful today as it was close to a century ago.  It speaks of life lived purely and respectfully, of the truest form of love any mortal ever knew, and describes our beautiful America before greed and carelessness trashed her splendor.<br /><br />David Langston is the Harvester, the Medicine Man.  At age 26 he lives a solitary life with only his dog and horse to keep him company.  He cultivates and harvests medicinal herbs and flowers on an acreage he has carefully developed.  Here, in nature's pristine beauty and a world of thriving birds and wildlife, David dreams of someday finding a woman who will love him truly and passionately.  He sees his Dream Girl in a vision and sets out with his typical persistence to find her.  So certain is he that this lovely vision will become reality, he adds onto his small home and creates furniture lovingly by hand to meet her every comfort.<br /><br />Ruth Jameson is ill in body, mind and spirit, a thin pale wraith of a girl.  But to David Langston she is beauty personified.  Her past has all but killed her, but David has no doubts.  He loves her and will sacrifice anything and everything to win her.  But first she must be made whole through pure food and nature's medicine, both laced generously with a decent man's devotion.  He marries the girl to save her from cruelty and squallor, and promises to put male desire on hold until she can come to him freely.  In his heart of hearts, he knows there is a chance she will never love him but he's willing to face that heartbreak if only she can be well again.<br /><br />I've been reading The Harvester at intervals since I was 12 years old.  But this is not a story for children.  It has adult themes and dialog.  The purity of prose and wonderful descriptions of America, the information about natural healing, and a love story that is unsurpassed make this book an amazing read today - as it was when first written.

He knows intimately the taste and smell of being dirt poor, has experienced the chill that settles deep into a person's marrow.  When it comes to the haves and have nots of life, he's walked both sides of that line and knows first hand the strengths and weaknesses of both.  He witnessed from an early age the deprivation that can drive both the strong and weak to violence and desperation.  And he by God knows determined courage when he see's it because he grew to manhood watching true fortitude in action.  In this book, courage and cowardice, violence and devotion, poverty and triumph are found in equal measure.<br /><br />Bragg's mother was a pretty southern girl who  married young.  When her husband went away to war in Korea, she waited loyally for his return.  The young man who loved music and laughter did not return to her from Korea.  In his place, she got an irresponsible alcoholic given to drunken rages and abuse who abandoned his growing family with regularity, leaving them to scrounge their way without him.  To feed her three sons, the author's mother worked long hours picking cotton and ironing the clothes of those who could afford such luxury.  Much of this memoir is a testament to his mother's strength, as well it should be.  The people and places he decribes are also memorable, whether Bragg speaks of them with bitterness or pride.  And he cuts himself very little slack in the telling.<br /><br />Whether sharing memories of Alabama, Africa, or Afghanistan, Rick Bragg sees life with his heart's eye, and documents prosaically his visions.  He writes of times and places few of us have seen, and does it with compassion.  All Over But the Shoutin' is a gift to those of us who love to read.	2004-03-13

US	36398642	R3CMUUAHQKB7IB	1413705278	351806972	Mujahidin	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Midwest Book Review	Jerry Mohrlang excels at historic fiction.  He proved that with his first book Sarawak, a historical novel in the classic sense.  Sarawak is one of my all-time favorite books, but he has surpassed himself with Mujahidin.  From the graphic ground wars and brusque military dialog, to his always memorable characters and eloquent descriptive narrative, Mujahidin is excellent in every way a novel should be<br /><br />Several major characters are introduced in Part One.  In 1973 Israel, the Yom Kippur War is brewing.  A massive Syrian army is gathering in preparation to overrun a small Israeli force.  One of the lesser known combatants is Major Aaron Harel, an American veteran of VietNam as yet unproven on Israeli soil.  The battle is horrific, realistically described, with Harel wounded and near death when his tank is destroyed by artillery fire.<br /><br />Part Two quite effectively tells us more about what made Aaron Harel into the man who fought beside Israelis in the Yom Kippur war.  As a boy, he's raised by an Israeli mother and an inattentive American step-father serving as a diplomat in the Middle East.  Young Aaron's friendships are with Afghan royalty, and with a powerful mujahidin who teaches  him the Afghan path to manhood.  Mujahidin means warrior in the Afghan language.  The boy Aaron learns what it means to be a Moslem warrior of the true faith, and that a man or warrior is nothing without honor.  I found Part Two to be an enlightening insight into the lives of Afghan tribesmen, and a touching tribute to a culture that both East and West have decimated by design.<br /><br />Aaron Harel, the man who barely survives the Yom Kippur War, is mujahidin in every sense of the word.  Six months after the war has ended he still battles to regain the strength and abilities he lost to injuries.  When approached by the Israeli Mossad to work as agent for their cause, he declines.  The gentle life of loving wife, home, and family was stolen from him in youth but he's beginning to find hope again with the nurse who worked to bring the shattered remnants of him back to life.  Sagretta Sharone.  When Sagretta's life is abruptly taken in a terroist attack, Aaron turns to the Mossad.  He has become the ideal Mossad agent - a multilingual warrior, at ease in many cultures, filled with rage and an insatiable hunger for revenge.  In a touching and exciting Part Four, Harel's past, present, and future meld when he returns to Afghanistan as Mossad operative working undercover with the CIA.<br /><br />In Mujahidin, author Mohrlang does more than simply spin a fascinating tale of man as modern warrior.  He takes the truest, fullest measure of what it means to be a man.  We learn of pain and courage, despair and honor, through glimpses into friendships and cultures far removed from our familiar modern lives.  I highly recommend Muhahidin as a must have, must read novel.to find hope again with the nurse who worked to bring the shattered remnants of him back to life.  Sagretta Sharone.

When Charlie McCuan rescues Garrett Steele and his little sister Maddie from stampeding cattle, she thinks Steele is a dumb greenhorn of the highest order.  What kind of real man would stand unprotected in the middle of a prairie and let a herd of cattle run him down?  Garrett has his own misconceptions of their rescuer.  He's mistaken Charlie for a cowboy, and an unpleasant one at that.  Charlie is no delicate flower.  She's a working ranch hand fighting dust and cattle right alongside the men in her father's employ.  But there are curves aplenty beneath her dirty clothes, and she has the kind of courage Garrett cannot begin to imagine.<br /><br />Charlie's father - James McCuan - is a heartless madman who has fathered four children.  As his oldest child, Charlie takes the brunt of vicious beatings regularly as she fights to shelter her siblings.  Garrett springs more than one big surprise on McCuan at their first meeting, including dishing out a beating when he catches the cruel rancher brutalizing Charlie.  Everything goes downhill from there for the mean spirited James McCuan.  He decides to kill Garrett, and his four children if necessary, to protect his holdings.  As a man, Garrett Steele stands tall, holds his ground.  He vows that no one else will ever hurt the feisty woman he admires and desires, or the fear-numbed siblings she protects.<br /><br />Garrett is a retired US Marshal with a legendary reputation.  He's no stranger to gunplay, and nobody's fool.  And yet he is compassionate and protective with Charlie and the children.  He's more than equal to the fight that brews with McCuan and his hired guns, but distracted by his growing love for Charlie.<br /><br />Despite the spicy sexual fireworks between Charlie and Garrett, this is more than a romance.  For those who love old west action, there's plenty of that to keep such readers occupied.  But this book is more than a simple western romance.  The characters are lively and believable and the theme of long term child abuse adds strength to the story line.  Ms. Boulds did a fine job with her first book.  I look forward to reading more of her writing.he characters are lively and believable and the theme of long term child abuse adds strength to the story line.

With efficiency and a quick mind, she's kept Investigative Services, Inc. in Knoxville Tennessee running smoothly for three years.  In her off hours she plays soccer with a go-for-the-jugular mentality.<br />Both on and off the soccer field, Nattie can dish it out as well as take it.  She has a feisty way about her, and a hair trigger temper.  Nattie has two goals in life:  to become a crack investigator and to climb her sexy and mysterious boss like a tree.<br /><br />Jonce Striker is the founder of I.S.I.  He's a man blessed with intimidating size and power, of Cherokee lineage, who keeps his secret past to himself.  Nattie has had a crush on him for three years but never dared to make her feelings known.  When he agrees to let her guard a wealthy client, the fur begins to fly.<br /><br />Roger Valentine is a nerdy billionaire who hires I.S.I. to protect him when his life is threatened.  Roger is seriously lacking in social skills.  When this lonely, isolated man with an overbearing mother meets up with Nattie and her colleagues, his life is changed in more ways than one.  His bodyguards soon become the friends and family Roger never had, and their friendship humanizes a once nerdy recluse.<br /><br />The action is intense as the bodyguards track more than one evil doer out to kill Roger.  Nattie's courage under fire, coupled with her zany personality, both impresses and infuriates her boss, adding humor to the mix. And the simmering sexual chemistry between Striker and Nattie finally ignites with mixed results for all concerned.  Can they keep their mind on business long enough to save Roger's life?<br /><br />The Bodyguard is a fun read, complete with sometimes frightening action, sizzling romance, and very human characters.

The hero of Bulletproof Soul - Dack Shannon - has helped win me over.<br /><br />Dack Shannon is a flawed man beset by inner demons.  He has a soft spot for children,  war veterans, and innocent folks at risk.  But God help the bad guys who cross his path.<br />Dack is a larger-than-life character, intriguing and unusual.<br />Abandoned at birth, he was raised in a Catholic orphanage and holds few things dear to his heart.  As a black ops specialist, his allegiance is to Majestic Services and his mysterious superior, Hank.  Dack is an albino, 6'5&quot; and skilled at rooting out and killing those who are deserving of such ends.  He operates outside the law, accountable to no one as he fulfills each grim assignment.  Dack does the dirty work, and in most cases law enforcement gets the credit as he fades into the night.<br /><br />In these twenty related tales, Dack Shannon and his compadres take on evil doers in their quest for justice.  Whether it be drug dealers, NSA spooks, a demented arsonist, or Goth grave robbers, no criminal prevails for long.  The strength of this anthology is the author's vivid imagination as a story teller.  His characters have depth and charisma.  Steven L.

As we have come to expect from Hominids and Humans - the first two books in this fine series - the interaction between human and Neanderthal provides unusual and exciting scenarios.<br /><br />This time around, distinguished Neanderthal scientists have crossed from their universe into ours via the portal created and maintained with Neanderthal technology.  Their scientific skills far surpass those of humans, and yet the world in which they live remains pristine.  Primeval forests thrive; water and air are pure and sweet; the oceans abound with life and no animals have gone extinct from over-hunting. Their work with DNA rivals anything humans have discovered.  The trusting Neanderthals believe the more information exchanged between worlds, the better, but their human counterparts are not so idealistic.  Human conditions are overcrowded, the environment fouled by fossil fuels and littered with garbage.  One powerful man sees the Neanderthal world as the new Eden and devises a horrifying plan to claim that rich wilderness for humans.<br /><br />Humans and Neanderthals socially, emotionally, and philosophically gain greater understanding of each other in Hybrids..  Still, there are many problems.  Humans cannot grasp the concept of a world without satellites, war, gps systems, cell phones, highways and airplanes.  Neanderthals cannot understand a species that would pollute the world they live in and greedily deplete all resources.  Meanwhile, Ponter and Mary plan to officially bond and have a child together.  Theirs will be the first hybrid offspring between Neanderthal and homo sapiens, if they can utilize technology that has been banned in Ponter's world.<br /><br />Hybrids is ethically and technologically intriguing..  The characters are fully developed and unique, whether they be good or evil.  Dangers threatening both worlds are realistic and mirror a multitude of problems present in our lives today.  Although Hybrids is the third and final book in Sawyer's Neanderthal series, the story could stand alone.  I do encourage you, however, to read this excellent and well written series in order.

Sawyer has won both the Nebula and Hugo Awards, and is nominated again this year.  Factoring Humanity is the fourth book I've reviewed by this author, and each one is exceptional.  Sawyer excels at putting a human face on technology and breathing soul into scientific data.  This sci fi thriller is a prime example.<br /><br />Heather Davis is a Psychology professor at the University of Toronto.  Her husband, Kyle Graves, experiments with Artificial Intelligence and quantum mechanics at the same university.  Their marriage has been strained by tragedy, and shattered with their youngest daughter's allegations of sexual abuse.  Both are devastated by loss and throw themselves into their work.  Heather's project is particularly intriguing.<br /><br />Every 31 hours and 51 minutes like clockwork, a new data message is received from space.  Its origin, a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A.  Heather and her colleagues around the world work at translating the messages without success, until one day she stumbles onto the key.  Quantum physcs, mathematical equations, and parallel universes play a part in the mystery.  First Heather and then Kyle is drawn into the conundrum with world changing results.  Will the messages from space unlock the mysteries of the human mind?  And will they be a path to healing or total annihilation of the human race?<br /><br />As in every novel by this author, the underlying technology is first rate and the characters  well defined.  Long time fans of Sawyer will love Factoring Humanity, and new readers of his work will understand why he wins Hugo and Nebula Awards.	2004-02-03

Between these covers you will find an erotic thriller, a haunting murder mystery, and high tech savvy most of us cannot imagine.<br /><br />Jack Pond learned at his father's knee to take care of business and \\"get it done\\".  That work ethic has fed Jack's success and made him a very rich man.  When Jack meets Lisa, it's love at first sight.

They are both consenting adults and everything is protected by encrypted passwords, right?  Wrong.  During a romantic cyber-encounter, Lisa is brutally murdered as Jack looks on.  >From that night, he isolates himself in high tech luxury and has nothing left to live for but the hunt for Lisa's killer.<br /><br />Jack's prey is pure voyeuristic evil, taking perverse pleasure in forcing friends and lovers to witness each victim's demise.  Technology easily tracks committed lovers amd casual pleasure seekers as they fulfill sexual fantasies online in supposed safety.  Lisa is the killer's first victim, but not the last.  Numbed into celibacy for several years, Jack wades through the sometimes unsavory cesspool  of private chat cams in search of clues.  One suspect after another is examined and eliminated.

Given the controversial subjects and scenarios of The Prince Must Die, a hidden identity might be in his best interest.  Wow! This one is a political thriller in the best British tradition, with a few dashes of good old American action and excitement thrown in for good measure. I don't very often say this, but it has MOVIE written all over it.<br />A select few powerful, wealthy, and well-placed British subjects have devised a plot to rid themselves of Prince Charles. The glory days are over for the Realm, and the Crown, the British Pound, and the Church of England no longer stand for anything. Race riots, unwanted immigrants, and neo-Nazi influences are tainting their elite existence. In their minds, Prince Charles is a socialist who has forgotten the importance of position, so Prince William will make a far preferable King. Prince Charles must die to make room for William.<br />The assination plot fails and must be revised. The group engineers the death of several citizens who threaten their secrecy. Detective Inspector Stanley West is on the case. He makes a dogged and determined adversary and a memorable character. Stanley loves being British and all that used to stand for. He misses the old Tory England, where fairness and decency prevailed and certain things were simply not done. Keeping a stiff upper lip is his mantra, and protecting the Royal Prince is his goal.<br />Oh, these characters were very well drawn and believable. In addition to Inspector West, I particularly liked the privileged doctors, Michael and Monty Rogerson and the stunning, cross dressing accomplished bisexual Christian Von Oberman.<br />Intrigue and double dealing MI5 and MI6 operatives abound as Stanley West attempts to solve the convoluted plot to kill his prince. Along the way we learn some fascinating bits of British history. The author keeps this plot moving at breakneck pace, and pulls it all together nicely.<br />This is indeed the stuff good movies are made of. (Think the Bruce Willis and Richard Gere version of The Jackal.) Recommended for adult readers due to sexual content.od movies are made of.

They should be lined up, clamoring to represent Ms. Goska.  This book is packed with exquisite prose, uniquely written.<br /><br />Miroswava Hudak is a young woman of Polish descent, floundering to gather shattered remnants of herself into some understandable whole.  Mira is sick to death of donning masquerades to survive, weary of pretense.  All her life she's seen herself as others see her, been defined by cruel words and brutal actions.  Regardless of her true size, she sees herself as fat.  As a child, food fed the craving space inside her.  As an adult, she denies that starveling child and searches for less fattening means of gaining nurture.  Healthy sexuality is smothered by her fear of being seen for what she imagines her appearance to be.  Exercise is helpful, but how much is too much?  And then she finds her answer.<br /><br />Words.  Language.  Thoughts and the expressing of them in her diary begins the reformation.  Mira learns through writing to know, accept, and understand herself.  And more, she learns forgiveness of past wrongs.  In her role as instructor to low-functioning college students, her view of humaniity is enhanced and enlarged.  The strength and understanding she gains feeds her students, and vice versa.<br /><br />Miroswava Hudak is a delicious heroine.  Her students are endearing - even the unappealing ones - and her family is sympathetically drawn despite their faults.  Not every writer could pull off a book like this.  Danusha Goska did, in spades, because she's an accomplished and intelligent wordsmith.	2004-01-16

Being a crack sniper and demolitions expert are among her military skills.  At age 22, love has been furthest from her mind as she pursued her twin careers.  When her childhood friend Fernando asks for Lissa's help, she goes to him despite her family's protests.<br /><br />Alexander Demitrius is the reigning prince of a once influential Mediterranean island paradise.  Warring rebels, headed by Fernando, have torn the Prince's world apart.  Alex is strong-willed, a powerful and charismatic leader with no intentions of allowing rebels to usurp his rule.  He dreams of a unified island and being taken seriously by the world.  When he meets what appears to be a guileless female tourist - the intrepid Melissa - his thoughts of warring are interrupted by dreams of her seduction.  Alex is no stranger to the game of seduction, but meets his match in this evasive Canadian female.<br /><br />Ah yes!  Passion flares from their first meeting, despite Melissa knowing they are destined to be enemies.  One part of her participates daily in down and dirty guerilla fighting - at which she excels - while the female heart of her imagines the virile Alexander as lover.  When she is captured by the enemy, the prince uses everything at his disposal to break her will.  Classic sensory deprivation fails to work so he reverts to applying his considerable charm.  Melissa is a virgin, ripe for the plucking, and more than willing to be plucked when sexual attraction turns to love.  And when a serious illness almost takes her life, Prince Alexander learns a bitter lesson:  Some things are more important than war or always being right.<br /><br />This author sets such scenes so well - leading lovers through their paces towards that inevitable first coupling - and she does not disappoint in Rebel Road.

He's a man who prides himself on resolving life's difficulties swiftly, with a minimum of fuss.  His stock in trade is honesty, enforced by reality based logic.  So how did such a straight shooter end up with two women in his life?  And how can he survive being torn between the two?<br /><br />Jaclyn is an accounting student he meets while evaluating the University Library for restoration.  She's everything he ever hoped for in a woman - curvaceous, straight forward, feminine and kind.  She lets him know straight off that he's the sort of man she wants in her life.<br /><br />The mayor foists his niece Sylvia on Alex, strongly hinting that a successful career restoring historical landmarks is dependent on his niece's participation in the library project.  It turns out to be not so huge a sacrifice.  Sylvia is shapely, sensible, and a natural beauty.  She finds Alex irresistable and he reciprocates.<br /><br />The premise of Torn is intriguing and unusual.  Two beautiful and honest women desire one man in their life - the young Alex Tanner - a man whose innate decency is a large part of his persona.  How the three friends resolve their triangle and remain true to themselves is the intriguing part.  Their very success and survival depends on<br />wisdom and determination.<br /><br />Torn holds no similarity to any book I've read.

Emma's watched friends and family conceive and give birth, attended baptisms and brisses.  At thirty-five, she's no longer the pretty young bride full of hope.  She's suffered through hormone therapy and the resulting mood swings, grieved over one failed insemination after another, and the strain has precipitated her husband's infidelity.  Despite the trials, they love each other, but Emma sees herself as barren, harboring that empty, desolate despair of a wife who can't conceive.  And then, as if things weren't bad enough, her sixty one year old father and his twenty five year old fiancee are expecting.<br /><br />I loved this story.

In this fictional account of two families through several generations, she shines a clarifying light on our deep seated prejudices as humans.  The results are entertaining, humorous, troubling, and poignant.<br /><br />Jake Rosen is a Russian Jew who arrives in the U.Sl in 1928 with high hopes and big dreams.  Around the same time, an Italian Catholic Al Mareno begins his new life on American shores.  For them, the American dream takes wings, becomes reality.  Despite their different backgrounds and religious beliefs, Al and Jake become fast friends and business partners.  Their wives Becky and Rita, and the children of both families are intertwined through shared goals, dreams, and friendship.  They share each other's religious holidays, troubles, and joys.  Until Gary Rosen and Tessa Mareno fall in love.  What follows is a shattered friendship and a successful business  dissolved while Tessa and Gary struggle to make their marriage work despite familial chaos and disapproval.<br /><br />As the years pass, the Rosens and Marenos experience more than simply religious prejudice.  The younger generation grows up in the infancy of Black Power and the fight for equal rights.  Infidelity and other troubling scenarios play a pivotal role, touching each generation to varying degrees.  Every generation of Rosens and Marenos faces a different but equally difficult set of \\"taboos.\\"  The beauty of this story is in how they cope, come to grips with, and eventually overcome each trial.<br /><br />They Stay the Same is a family saga worth reading.  The characters are human and believable and the story an American tale that captures time and place through each generation.  The back cover blurb was right.  I was not prepared for the ending.<br /><br />Not recommended for young or sensitive readers due to sexual situations.	2004-01-01

If this first installment is any indication, the series should reach best selling status once again.  The first paragraph of chapter one was so well written, I read it through three times.  This man can write!<br /><br />Wilf Ansor Brim - the helmsman - is a charismatic character indeed.  Through intelligence, skill, and grit he has raised himself from humble beginnings to reach what to most would be an impossible goal.  Determination has taken him from life in lowly Carescrian mines to one as officer of the Imperial Fleet.  His courage eventually transforms him into a decorated hero of space battles, mingling with royalty in palaces of State.<br /><br />Wilf Brim is a warrior with the soul of a poet.  In The Helmsman, we meet his compatriots - Nik Ursis, the huge Barbousse, Capt. Collingswood - as Wilf sees his first battle action.

Through it all he forges strong bonds of friendship, gaining respect from peers and commanders.  Oh, and his life is not all battle action all the time.  Wilf finds love with Princess Margot Effer'Wyck.  The beautiful royal is scheduled to marry another man, but seeks out Wilf to be her secret lover.

And when his first book, Carver: High Mountain Tragedy, was nominated and placed third in the Dorothy Parker Awards in Excellence, it was no fluke.  All this author's books are thought provoking and quirkily intriguing.<br /><br />In The Room Beyond the Veil, past and present converge with sometimes hair raising results.  21-year old Tom Jewett and his wife Sally move from Nebraska to Colorado and buy a 19th century fixer-upper.  Tom falls in love with their new home immediately but Sally has her doubts.  Despite their discovery of secret rooms laden with treasures from the past, Sally has a sense of foreboding. Tom's dreams of visiting his past are real and frightening.  His ancestry beckons by day and by night, and Sally is helpless to forestall the outcome.<br /><br />In the early morning hours, during a thunderstorm, Tom goes downstairs to check their fusebox and simply disappears.  He wakes up in 1870, in the person of a long dead ancestor named Ulysses Jewett, age ten.  Several members of the nineteenth century Jewett family have died of influenza.  Tom as Ulysses realizes he has been returned to the past to ensure the survival of future generations.  But will he ever return to Sally and resume the life they shared?<br /><br />I don't want to reveal all of Foertmeyer's secrets.  The plot is tight and believable, the characters of both centuries strong and well developed.  Old ways and new add to the story's interest.  For example, modern technology is used in one century to solve the mysteries of another.  Foertmeyer books are never boring or predictable and always exciting.  If you like mysteries, time travel, or simply a well written story, this one has it all.	2003-11-08

Johnson is the author of several published books - A Divorced Mother Talks to God was her first.  Two delightful children's e-books, Billy Brimly and Red and His Fur Hat quickly followed.  This time, Ms. Johnson has given us a book of poetry.  True to everything she does, Whispers of Life is a gift from the heart of a woman of faith.<br /><br />The book is divided into several topics.  The first group of poems addresses her thoughts and feelings after our national tragedy of 9/11.  In \\"Another Day\\" she captures clearly what so many of us were thinking on that awful day:<br />  I sit and try to hide the tears<br />  I'm still not sure what happened here<br />  My world is shattered in pieces now<br />  I hear a plane and hit the ground<br /><br />In \\"Dear America\\" she writes from the spirit of an American serviceman who now fights the war in Iraq:<br />  Dear America, remember me<br />  I fight on the battlefield for Liberty<br />  I stand proud for the Country I love<br />  I am your brother, your father, your son<br /><br />\\"I Know This Evil\\" is one of my favorites because of its quiet eloquence:<br />  You've come to kill us, our very souls<br />  To take our loved ones and cause us woes<br />  To rip our hearts to tiny bits<br />  And use our tears to fuel your ships<br /><br />It isn't only her thoughts on terrorism and war the author shares with us.  Tender tributes to her family and friends comprise the second segment of Whispers of Life.  All are touching and thought provoking paeans to the people she loves in life or remembers in death.  In the final segment, she ponders life and all its many trials.  \\"Fleeting Life\\" expresses well her thoughts:<br />  Why are these things always hidden<br />  And not revealed till our eyes grow dim<br />  The things that we deemed so important<br />  Mean nothing at the end<br /><br />I could continue quoting, but will end this review with an excerpt from<br />\\"Horses and Missiles\\":<br />  Leaders are dignified, but ready to fight<br />  Smiling broadly, eyes dark as night<br />  Innocent bystanders watching their gaze<br />  Not wanting at all to be a ploy in the game<br />  Refugees, hunger, disease and the like<br />  Socialite dinners, food by candlelight<br /><br />Whispers of Life is a hearts cry against injustice, a pleading question to the Almighty God who says He loves us all, and a gentle protest at how swiftly life defeats us.  Her poems are simple and rhyming, intense with sorrow and joy.

Many are humorous or thought provoking metaphors, both subtle and profound.  Everyday happenings and imaginary tales are recorded in lyrical style.  There are songs and sonnets to delight children and adults alike, constructed in both freeform and rhyme.<br /><br />I found the following exercpt from \\"I Write So You'll Remember\\" to be particularly profound:<br />  The walls of earth are littered<br />  With the ruins of fallen stars<br />  And runes of men.<br /><br />\\"One-Punch Willy Brown\\" was a humorous story-song, excerpted here:<br />  The gals all sidled near him; the guys seemed to leave him  alone.<br />  We all knew his reputation and that Willy was bad to the  bone.<br />  They say he once knocked out a horse or a mule and his hands  could move faster than light.<br />  We all knew how he came by his nickname; with one punch he  could end any fight.<br /><br />\\"Winter Ride\\" is a free form poem, one of my favorites.  I chose one small excerpt as an example:<br />  A dark blacktop ribbon<br />  stretches,<br />  merging into the soft,<br />  misty, battleship gray<br />  curtain of sky.<br /><br />\\"Prisoner of War\\" expresses comtemporary concerns from the POW's point of view:<br />  The throbbing ache of wounds<br />  Crusted with blood and fear<br />  Tell me I'm alive.<br /><br />There is something for every age in Sketches From Life, to be read aloud to children or pondered by adults.  This poet has the curiosity of a child encased nicely in the mind of an adult.  If you like poetry, give this one a try.	2003-10-24

Think Raymond Chandler complete with hi-tech savvy and a contemporary edge.  Press releases dub this book \\"classic noir\\", and it certainly is that, combined with well-defined characters and an unusual plot<br /><br />Carver Hartnett is a straight arrow insurance fraud investigator who tells the story in first person.  Miranda Pryor is the chaste but seductive object of Carver's desire.  And Lenny Stillmach is the friend who manages to be a high tech genius despite manic-depression and chronic drug and alcohol abuse.  These three friends comprise the team of fraud investigators who are very good at what they do.  Each brings different but effective skills to the team.<br /><br />Lenny's unexpected death under strange circumstances casts suspicion on his friends.  These suspicions are compounded by the discovery that he has purchased multiple six figure life insurance policies naming Carver and Miranda, as well as others, as beneficiaries.  Seems that Lenny's boss, the local police, and FBI think he has been running a lucrative scam by buying and selling high dollar policies for fun and profit.  Carver can't trust anyone, including Mrianda, and he finds himself up to his eyebrows in a local and federal investigation.  His life is in danger and it's up to him to find out why as he tries to separate the good guys from the evil doers.<br /><br />Richard Dooling is an award nominated author because his wordsmithery is unique.  His style is modern with the noir voice of past masters of the genre.  Bet Your Life is not a simplistic tale.  Intelligent fans of the genre will enjoy the experience.	2003-10-17

Blessed with a sharp memory, very early on Jack's childhood friends nicknamed him &quot;Memory Babe&quot; and that is where the book got its name.  Packed with fascinating details and exquisitely written,  this book needs to be discovered by a younger generation of readers.<br /><br />Many of us alive today have heard of Jack Kerouac but I doubt few  know the details of his tragic life.  That he remains the voice of a generation and a literary icon goes without saying.  Kerouac was a physically beautiful but emotionally flawed man with a tormented spirit.  He spent his life as man and writer trying to prove that &quot;the past is the root of the future, and that a man cannot live without the continuity of both.&quot;  Jack remembered everything he heard, as if words were sacred and his mind was a sponge.  Despite his many flaws, he always paid &quot;exquisite attention to the sound of language.&quot;<br /><br />Even as he mapped new territory as a writer,  Kerouac was adrift as a man.  As the first spokesman for the &quot;beat&quot; generation, he perfected that voice with guilt, self-doubt, and self-punishment.  This biography clearly states Jack's definition of &quot;beat&quot;:  &quot;beat down, beat up, all-tired-out.&quot;  Still, his words were always carefully chosen.  Word by word, Kerouac carefully created phrases to express time, place, emotion, and man's senses, communicating deep meaning.  His writing was full of symbolism and visions, allegory and veiled reality, profanity and parody, as he groped his way with prose towards his own death.  For his time, Kerouac's verbal ingenuity was unsurpassed.<br /><br />Personally, his charismatic male persona disguised a quicksilver child, mischievous and unpredictable.  As he aged, Jack became a brooding, paranoid, hard drinking drug user, insecure in his sexuality and prone to alcoholic blackouts.  As addiction wrecked his health, his light slowly drowned out and he became a lonely and despairing figure.  But for decades in between youth and death, this trusting, shy, socially awkward man became a literary legend.<br /><br />Jack Kerouac rubbed shoulders with Jackson Pollock, Allen Ginsberg, and every jazz great of his day.  He was published by several of the major New York publishing houses.  His prose and poetry were unprecedented and have not been successfully imitated since.  He died young, never fully realizing the effect of his mind and his work on subsequent generations.<br /><br />Gerald Nicosia has penned THE definitive biography of Kerouac.  From letters, journals, tapes, interviews, and Jack Kerouac's books themselves - all faithfully recorded in a detailed bibliography - the author has skillfully dissected the life of the &quot;beat&quot; generation's strongest voice.  The result is both scholarly and deeply personal, touching and disturbing.  It should be required reading in every college and university, and a must have book for any reader curious about Kerouac and his time.As addiction wrecked his health, his light slowly drowned out and he became a lonely and despairing figure.

Moments of simple beauty are skillfully interspersed with human degradation most of us alive today cannot imagine.  The story, and the author's writing style, are simply stunning.<br />Nikolei Nowikovski tells his story in first person.  This young Jewish Ukrainian survives the battle of Stalingrad but moves from one hell to another when taken prisoner by the Germans.  By blessing or strange coincidence of Fate, Nikolei transforms himself into Sergei Bambura and successfully masquerades as an Aryan Wehrmacht officer in Prague.  As Russian cannon fodder and then Nazi, he witnesses atrocities and cruelty beyond human comprehension.  And all the while, he hides his Jewishness behind a well-contrived facade.<br />The loss of his past and the murder of a once-proud Europe are starkly told through Nikolei / Sergei's eyes and thoughts.  Amidst the carnage and hopelessness, he meets Daniela Zaviskova.  Daniela is young, beautiful, and a Czech prostitute.  Despite the pain that causes him -- imagining this wondrous girl having sex with other men -- she swiftly becomes \\"the flesh on which to hang new hopes.\\"  He is obsessed with Daniela, loves her, wants to spend his life with her, prays she will one day love him and forsake prostitution.<br />The apartment they share in Prague holds amazing secrets.  As Nikolei experiences Nazi Occupation, Stalinist Russia, and the carving up of Europe by the allies, one secret after another is revealed to him.  The end of war is overwhelming, \\"a mixture of grief and joy with only numbness in between.\\"  He learns why Daniela prostitutes herself, and for whom.  It's then that Nikolei begins to understand the depth and breadth of unconditional love.<br />This review barely scratches the surface of Daniela.  Stephen Weeks has clearly researched Europe of the Nazi era, the battles, the heroes and malefactors.  I felt transported to the time and place, suffered, loved, and marveled at the courage, cried at the losses and atrocities.  It's not for the faint-hearted or those disturbed by graphic sex and violence. Be prepared to be surprised, outraged, touched, and sometimes shocked at every twist and turn of plot.  I give my highest recommendation to Daniela.he time and place, suffered, loved, and marveled at the courage, cried at the losses and atrocities.

This was my first experience reviewing a travel guide, and it was a delightful surprise.  Anything the traveler could possibly want or need to know can be found between these covers.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me was the Long Island history.  Beginning with the ice age - which created the unique topography - to the Native Algonquian Indians, progressing through early Dutch and English settlers, the island's history is fascinating.  Ms. Silverman also describes the geology and geography and provides detailed maps.  It is a diverse land of pine barrens and beaches, state parks and golf courses, hiking trails and woodlands.  I was thinking &quot;Wow!&quot; before I'd finished reading the introduction.<br /><br />The book is arranged rather handily into distinct areas of Long Island - Nassau County, Suffolk County, and Fire Island.  The author then breaks down each area into points of interest and backs up her information with first hand impressions, phone numbers, websites, helpful tips and intriguing tidbits.<br /><br />Sources of transportation available by car, rail, bus, plane, plus directions are provided.

Her gift for creating compelling characters and an exciting story comes a cropper in Chasing Demons.  This third book is Christy Tillery French at her best.<br /><br />At age 14, a beautiful and innocent Kendra is &quot;traded&quot; by her father to Tony Salvatori.  Tony is a mobster, an evil, murderous villain of the worst kind.  Wealthy and powerful, he grooms the young girl he's renamed Angel to be his wife.  At age 18, he marries Kendra / Angel and sets out to make her into the sort of woman he can be proud of in public.  Over time her life becomes a nightmare of vicious beatings and observing Tony's murderous vendettas.  When he deliberately causes her to miscarry their child, she escapes with the help of a sympathetic henchman.<br /><br />Battered and hemorrhaging, she finds shelter on the property of Garth Fisher.  Garth is a burnt out cop who lives in self imposed isolation in the mountains of North Carolina.<br />At first shocked and moved by Angel's condition, he soon feels admiration for her courage.  Over time, his concern for her turns to tenderness, and then love.  The only man Angel has ever known intimately is the brutal Tony.  Garth's quiet strength and gentle consideration are a new experience, one she'd like to explore if only Tony's spectre was not threatening their lives.<br /><br />The raging Tony cuts a violent swath through several states in his maddened search for Angel.  And when he and his goons catch up to Garth and Angel, all hell breaks loose.  But Angel has vowed to rid herself of Tony.  No more chasing demons.  The final chapters are full of adrenalin pumping action as Angel takes her stand with Garth beside her.<br /><br />It seems Ms. French can write in any genre.  Her work is always &quot;no holds barred&quot; excitement, with strong and believable characters racing to a satisfying climax.  If you like action thrillers with a healthy dose of romance, give Chasing Demons a whirl.<br /><br />Any movie producers out there?

Each book is different, well plotted, with strong characters.<br /><br />Ruth Dennison is 29 years old, a school teacher still grieving over the loss of her parents to a car accident.  She prays every day to forgive the drunken driver who killed her parents and filled her days with sorrow.  She treasures fond memories of her parents and the home they cherished.  There has never been a special man in Ruth's life.  She's lonely and depressed, but fills that empty void by devoting herself to the children in her classroom.  One of her students troubles Ruth.  Eight year old Jason Winters has swiftly gone from excellent happy student to pensive and withdrawn child.  She suspects trouble on the home front and hopes to learn more from Jason's father.<br /><br />Wyndom Winters is a 34 year old widower whose marriage was a heart breaking sham long before his ex wife died in a car accident.  He and his son live with his alcoholic mother-in-law so Jason will have supervision while Wyndom works.  When he meets Jason's teacher, Ruth Dennison, he's impressed by her sweetness.

Jason's cruel, alcoholic grandmother has plans for Wyndom and Jason that do not include Ruth.  And the truth of how her parents died in the same accident as Wyndom's wife is a bitter pill for Ruth to swallow.<br /><br />Ruth Fever is a satisfying read, a heart warming tale of two decent, lonely people drawn together by their love for Jason and each other.  It gets my highest recommendation.decent, lonely people drawn together by their love for Jason and each other.  It gets my highest recommendation.	2003-08-26

He's a poet who puts his heart into words.  He writes about his children, his work, the land, and longs for simple times when man understood his place in the world.  As poet, Kosmicki does not become \\"...too tired to care too blind to see.\\", despite the fact that his work as a UPS driver is slowly draining him dry.<br />In \\"Driving\\", he speaks of \\"...laughing desperate men.\\"  In \\"First Time on a Time Clock\\" he documents such desperation clearly without mincing words, shown here in an excerpt:.<br />Felt like I was being castrated and having a current of a thousand volts<br />of electricity run through me through the time recorder.<br />Like a man who has to stand by and witness the death of his best friend<br />by disembowelment at the hands of a cruel ogre.<br />The slow inevitable sliding climb toward death had begun<br /><br />Kosmicki is a man who longs with yearning spirit to preserve the beauty around him in verse.  He watches birds, \\"....longingly wanting their songs...\\"  His eyes take in the glorious Nebraska Sandhills as his heart grieves for birds that smash into the windshield and snakes he accidentally crushes on roadways.  Locked into a soul-numbing routine, he seeks to find a balance between death and the natural wonders around him.  Such balance is struck eloquently in \\"Trail Road Sky.\\"<br />I ran over a bullsnake today,<br />a beautiful 4 foot long one.<br />under a prairie grass sky<br />I couldn't stop.<br />It was stretched across the road,<br />under a meadowlark sky...<br />...for the next hour,<br />or more, I thought<br />under a killdeer sky<br />about that snake<br />and how alike we are.<br />under a ruffled grouse sky...<br />...and dammit,<br />I kept running into birds all day -<br />under a dragonfly sky...<br />Greg Kosmicki tells it like it is.

It is a map of secret journeys to be shared, read and reread.<br /><br />Greg Kosmicki, Editor and Publisher, says it well:  &quot;Times of Sorrow Times of Grace&quot; is a showcase for the talents that grow like wildflowers among the writers of the Great Plains / High Plains who happen to be women.&quot;<br /><br />It is a daunting task, reviewing an anthology of poetry and prose created through the gifts of many female writers.  I am a prairie dweller and writer myself.  I've experienced first hand the beauties and sorrows, and yet I found myself astounded by the power of their words.  Poets and story tellers shared familiar workworn faces from which every dream has fled, the shame of discovering pockets of starvation and neglect amidst plenty.  Secrets that poison generations are spoken plainly, along with heart stabbing sorrow that will never be mended.  I read of precious shining moments frozen in time, love that could not be battered or shattered into indifference.  And there is the sort of beauty one can only find in the plains - sights, scents, and sounds.  Huge black prairie skies full of stars remain unchanged through every generation.  Weather, people, and everyday life are lamented or extolled in turn.  If you want to see what life is truly like in the wide open spaces, you'll get a feel of plains living in this book.<br /><br />My congratulations to Backwaters Press and Mr. Kosmicki for publishing Times of Sorrow Times of Grace.  The content is excellent and well worth reading.	2003-08-03

But the contemporary issues were real enough and the characters clearly defined in this work of fiction.<br /><br />Joe Forcione is wealthy, successful, living his dream life in the East Hamptoms with a young and [physically attractive] wife.  He's proud of his palatial beach home and pleased that his investments have accumulated into the multi millions.  But Joe is sixty.  The vicissitudes of age are taking over.  He turns to a phallic implant and viagra to offset his impotence, consults a priest dispensing healing miracles for dental bone loss, but what can Joe do to achieve immortality?  He does not want to die.  Of all spectres, past or present, Joe Forcione fears death.<br /><br />Joe's quest - and a large chunk of his money - takes him around the world.  He has sheep gland injections in an exclusive Swiss clinic and invests in various life enhancing or prolonging techniques.  Perhaps he can escape death through cryogenics or cloning! The sky's the limit if you have the cash to buy it.  Joe's mood improves along with his hope of finding eternal youth and escaping death.  Soon he has a pregnant wife and mistress, an increasing [physical] appetite encouraged by a wandering eye, and a whole new set of problems to resolve.<br /><br />The characters in this book are not caricatures.  Joe Forcione is a typical American in search of ever increasing wealth and all the trappings money can buy.  And I particularly liked Father McDermott, the healing priest with feet of clay, who moonlights as an actor and enjoys quality time with his mistress every chance he gets.  There is humor in this book as well as surrealistic science fiction, and an underlying truth that all humans must eventually face.  Nothing is permanent.<br /><br />Recommended for mature audiences due to strong [physical]content.	2003-08-03

If the prose in HOMEFIELD is any indication of his ability as wordsmith, he certainly deserved that award.  Richter's sonata is a harmonic blend of disparate voices telling a story that is more truth than fiction.  The characters are richly layered,<br />powerful, and authentic.<br />Cal Parsons is a country boy turned  radical protestor, on again off again college student, and political refugee.  A self-described draft dodger and road tramp, he returns to his rural Nebraska roots.  His anti-establishment, anti-war rage has died out.  Cal takes comfort in the simple familiarity of open fields, the west wind, and azure sky  He finds shelter on the farm where his aging Uncle Karl and Aunt Martha labor endlessly at tasks city folks could not imagine. And, sadly,  he finally finds love in the person of an old friend's wife.<br />Karl, in his 70's, can quietly and capably outwork any 20-year old.  He has grown his hair and beard long in stoic protest of injustices everywhere. Karl's battered hands are his history, the time tellers of his life, and his mind a living instruction manual for all things mechanical.  Martha has been his short, round helpmate through life, staunch advocate of family and life<br />traditions.  She cooks, takes pride in their home, raises a huge garden, cans fruits and vegetables, and keeps Karl's life on an even keel.<br />Buckwheat Van Anders has been Cal's friend and blood brother since boyhood. Even as a crippled veteran of Vietnam, Buckwheat's voice is powerful and he has more going for him than most.  All Cal's old friends since childhood lend their voices to the HOMEFIELD sonata, but Buckwheat's profanely honest<br />philosophy was a stand out.<br />The truths told in HOMEFIELD brought smiles and laughter, but also made my stomach hurt and my heart ache.  Dying farm towns.  An endlessly floundering agricultural economy.  Horror and wounds that never really heal despite the passages of time.  Loving and making love.

Through letters and clippings of the period, plus detailed court records and footnotes, the author reveals this disquieting history.  The history discussed in this book explains, perhaps in part, why the founders of our constitution were so adamant about the separation of church and state.  The author laid out his beginning groundwork quite effectively, step by step, with footnotes to prove each point:<br />The Society of Jesuits was banished by Pope Clement in the 18th century and reinstated by the Congress of Vienna in the 19th century.<br />The Congress of Vienna at that time struck down the rights on which the USA was founded - a free press, a representative government, and separation of Church and State.<br />Jesuit history, philosophy, and oaths are not Christ-serving<br />The Jesuits are a society of hand chosen warrior priests who serve both short and long term goals of the Papacy.<br />As a group, the Jesuit's methods are so effective that Heinrich Himmler used the order as a model for his Nazi SS.<br />The conspiracies surrounding the assassination of President Lincoln, and the failed or successful assassinations of other presidents and politicos are numerous and well documented.  There were, however, other revelations that gave me pause.  One quote, in particular, struck a chilling and familiar chord.  This quote was taken from Fifty Years in the Church of Rome by Charles Chiniquy, and refers to long term goals of the Jesuits.<br />  \\"What does a skillful general do when he wants to conquer a country?  Does he scatter his soldiers over the farmlands and spend their energy in plowing the fields?  NO!  He keeps them close to his flanks and marching towards the strongholds of the rich and powerful cities.  The farming countries then submit and become the price of this victory without moving a finger to subdue them.\\"<br />This quote brought to me a vision of our modern day cities - decaying and crime ridden - and our family farms decimated and lost in the modern financial and political shuffle.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a sobering experience on many levels.  I thought it an interesting aside that \\"spin doctors\\" existed long before the 20th century.  The spin, smoke and mirrors, and whitewash coatings applied to the historical events in this book are up there with anything modern times might offer.  Read Democracy Under Siege.

The Snakeman Cometh is such a book.  Set in the rugged Cumberland Mountains, with the Daniel Boone National Forest as its backdrop, the author's tale is both poignant and disturbing.<br /><br />Jolene Mosley is a \\"coltish ten year-old\\" when the snake handling Reverend Browning makes his first appearaance in her Appalachian mining town.  It's the 1940's.  Mining is mostly all the menfolk know, while their women stay home to cook, clean, and raise a passle of kids.  Life is simple but hard.  It doesn't take the charismatic Reverend long to bring his flock around to his way of thinking.  Religious dogma, harsh rules, and even harsher judgments become the accepted way of life with Browning and his version of God presiding.  All enthusiasm, every individual behavior is drummed out of Browning's followers, including Jolene.  She lives the life of all True Believers.  No books, except the Bible, and no fun allowed in their colorless existence.  Her curious mind and outspoken personality have been blunted as she reaches a joyless adolescence.<br /><br />And then the good Reverend's nephew Russell Nash comes to town.  Recently released from prison, Russell is a past victim of Browning's voracious quest for power.  The young stranger has a good heart, a quiet way about him, but rejects his uncle's harsh ways.  When Nash's budding friendship with Jolene blossoms into tender concern, and then desire, life among the True Believers is turned upside down.<br /><br />Throughout, I worried for Jolene, wondering who would cause her downfall first - the snake handling Reverend or her sex crazed brother.  The plans Browning has for her are chilling, moreso because her parents go along with it.  With Russell Nash as the one kindly presence in her drab life, she devises a desperate way to escape cruel fate.<br /><br />Despite the simple telling of this story, The Snakeman Cometh was a devastating read.  The author's character development and the purity of her prose took my breath.  Ms. Alexander has two previously published books:  Return to Suicide and Dance of the Misbegotten.  I look forward to reading them both with the greatest anticipation.<br /><br />This book has harsh themes, but is appropriate for adults and mature adolescents.

The Story of Sugar	Books	5	261	261	N	N	Midwest Book Review - troubling story well written	Azucar! is a beautifully written, starkly realistic story of life on a Caribbean sugar cane plantation.  Alan Cambeira constructs this tale with vivid prose and memorable characters.  Readers will be enchanted and horrified in turn, as they are transported into the lives of those who toil in horrible conditions from sunup to sundown harvesting the cane fields.  Those living in comfort around the world, enjoying the fruits of such labors, may be unnerved to learn the harsh realities revealed in Azucar!<br /><br />Azucar is an innocent young girl when she is brutally raped by the son of a cane plantation overseer.  Dona Fela is the grandmother who raised her, the matriarch of those who come and go from this plantation.  She vows to find a better life for Azucar somehow, and calls up island mysticism to fulfill that vow.  Life for laborers on the present day plantation is no better than it was centuries ago.  Men, women, and able children are forced to labor long hours under the brutal tropical sun.  They live in squalor, without electricity, indoor plumbing, or running water.  Food provided them is minimal.  Still, the workers band together to survive and maintain their humanity as best they can.<br /><br />Through a series of chance happenings, Azucar is taken from her life in the cane fields to one of privilege and comfort.  It's a long way from the sugar cane fields to Toronto's Victoria College, but she makes that transition with ease.  She is tranformed from a slave into a young woman of natural beauty and intelligence.  When Azucar meets the wealthy and successful Lucien St. Jacques, the attraction is immediate and lasting.  His face and voice remind her of the islands and passion swiftly follows.<br /><br />Mr. Cambeira has captured the mysterious and sensual rhythm of the tropics in his prose.  He clearly portrays the beauty and courage of its native people, and helps the reader understand Caribbean history.  Azucar! is a troubling tale set in a breathtaking locale.

This reviewer is horrified to think that it may already BE too late.  Be warned, readers.  This book is chilling reading.  I barely know where to begin or which salient point to stress.  The author states that the best slaves are those who believe they are free, such as the citizens and taxpayers of the USA.  Here are a few more points made in America's Autopsy Report:<br />The US Constitution, long a shining light to the world, was trashed by the Patriot Act and Homeland Security Act.  Our freedoms have been stolen by bankers, arms makers, politicians, and big business, and no segment of society is safe from their plundering.<br />Our government has long been polluted by conspirators who labor tirelessly to enrich each other.<br />Citizens and politicians - the same sort of stalwart souls who decried the Nazi persecutions and atrocities and today point out Hussein's elimination of his own people - eliminated 60 million American Indians in the name of \\"manifest destiny.\\"  And they did not blink an eye or shed a tear while doing it.<br />The same people who instigate the wars control the media that brainwashes us each day.<br />The results of high level investigations into happenings of national concern are kept from those who fund them - the US taxpayers.<br />Our votes do not count.  They have not counted for a long long time.  We hide our heads, pursue our trivial desires, and hope someone will fix the mess we are in.<br />Where did AIDS really come from and why do medicines kill?<br />Who actually inflicted the wound of 9/11 on America?  Did we need another \\"Pearl Harbor\\" event to justify new laws that inhibit freedon?<br />Is it really true?

A Picture of Guilt was a fast, engaging, and exciting read.  If you enjoyed the author's first novel, you will love this one.<br />Ellie Foreman is back, along with daughter Rachel and attentive lover David Linden.  This time, the honest and uncompromising Ellie gets dragged into a botched murder investigation.  As the plot unfolds, and potential witnesses turn up dead, Ellie's world goes haywire.  She's stalked by thugs with Mafia and Tong connections, dogged by police and FBI.  And that is the least of her worries.  The more information she uncovers, the more dangerous her life becomes.  The full picture, once it is revealed, goes beyond dangerous and frightening.<br />I don't want to give this plot away.  The story was well-crafted and intense, exciting and enticing right up to the last page.  Murder-mystery-suspense readers will love this one.  It's a must read.	2003-08-02

The effect is lyrical and soulful.<br /><br />The poet's friend is an artist who translates her hopes and beliefs into colorful mediums, much like Ms. McCleery uses words.  Their conversations are often blunt, sometimes bordering on the argumentative, but always underlined with the sort of love and respect friends offer in support of each other.  In \\"Girl Talk (AIDS / quilt)\\" their conversation centers on the artist's friend who died of AIDS.  Listening to her friend's reminiscence, watching her create a tribute, the poet says:<br />  \\"Given a little privacy, I'd have cried.\\"<br /><br />Simple.  Profound.  Empathetic.  Those words came to mind often as I read Girl Talk.  In \\"Girl Talk (v. monologues)\\" she says:<br />  \\"Told me about a girlfriend of hers, an artist:<br />  as a child abused head t' toe 'n in between<br />  inside out 'n she's never seen a counselor<br />  but she's workin' with imagery of clenched fists<br />  also of Georgia O'Keefe-like flowers<br />  could be like Tennessee Wiliams' definition:<br />  a bruised orchid his vagina metaphor ...\\"<br /><br />Ms. McCleery uses imagery as an artist uses paint, with meanings both obvious and layered in effect.  In \\"My Daughter Brings me Garbage Flowers\\" :<br />  \\"Most want the virgin rose buds.<br />  She knows I prefer the blatant,<br />  immodest, blowzy, open blossoms.<br />  Brings them wrapped in pastel tissue papers<br />  holding them in her arms the way<br />  I carried her before she walked.\\"<br /><br />The friends talk of lovers, of old pleasures and sorrows, of losses and learnings.  The poet puts to words what she sees in her friend's metaphorical paintings.  In \\"Girl Talk (tracings)\\" the subject is a lover's fading interest:<br />  \\"...but something<br />  (the moon?)<br />  had washed the touch<br />  from his eyes...\\"<br /><br />The quote this author uses in introduction seems particularly evocative of her work.  The quote is from \\"Aurora Leigh\\" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning circa 1857.  \\"Never flinch.\\"<br /><br />Ms. McCleery does not flinch, which is why her poetry has heart and spirit.(the moon?)<BR>                  had washed the touch<BR>                  from his eyes...\\"<BR> <BR>The quote this author uses in introduction seems particularly evocative of her work.

He was a midwestern boy with a gift that found life with his first cartoon character, Mickey Mouse.  Through the dark years of the American depression, Walt's cartoon characters brought laughter, hope, and promise to a country that had very little to dream about.  Mickey was quickly followed by Pluto, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White and her Seven Dwarves, Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket.  The world lost Walt Disney to lung cancer in 1966.  Supposedly he was cremated, but rumors circulated and continue to persist that he was cryogenically preserved until a cure for cancer could be found.<br />Larry Pontius takes that rumor and runs with it, and thereby hangs a tale.<br /><br />Failed projects, modern problems, and mismanagement by men who lost sight of Walt's original dream have brought the Disney Corp. to a serious predicament.  Several elderly men - Walt's secret Circle - know the time has come to activate his resurrection.  Disney HAS been cryogenically preserved and an as yet FDA approved cure for cancer has been developed.  When the old friends try to steal ampules of the experimental cancer drug, one of them dies from the excitement and the plan fails.  On to Plan B of a very well-planned out return of Walt Disney to life and power.  Younger members join the inner circle.  Walt is thawed, rejuvenated, and the cancer treatment begins.<br /><br />Waking Walt is a fun, exhilarating read.  Mr. Pontius writes very well and creates his story so plausibly that I had no problem whatsoever believing the fiction.  The characters were top notch, especially the cranky opinionated Walt Disney who hides his Peter Pan-Jiminy Cricket heart under a gruff exterior.  His Circle of protectors and friends is an unlikely mix of quirky personalities.  Their devotion to Walt, his dream and its bright promise, was quite touching.  And in the end, everyone learns a fitting lesson, including Mr. Disney.<br /><br />Nicely rendered resurrection, Mr. Pontius.son, including Mr. Disney.  <BR> <BR>Nicely rendered resurrection, Mr. Pontius.	2003-07-08

But that was before I read Simplicity.  Mr. Dirschel creates a provocative tale here.  The narrative was finely crafted and the characters memorable.  Be warned.  The subject matter is often troubling and sometimes grotesque, but that does not negate the fact that Mr. Dirschel writes very well.<br /><br />Patrick has been homeless since his middle teens.  A hopeless alcoholic, he considers himself to be \\"an invalid eyesore of a man.\\"  His crib is wherever he can find shelter for the night.  His days are spent begging to buy whiskey and a little food to keep himself alive and moving.  One night he sees a lovely young girl contemplating jumping off the bridge above his concrete shelter.  Her blonde hair, sweet face, and soft skin stir feelings in him that he thought were long since pickled into nothingness.  To his shock, this lovely vision talks with him as if he were human, treats him kindly.  One night later Patrick watches Lori jump to her death from the bridge.  And that is where the real story begins.<br /><br />Before the moment of impact, Lori is swept away by a dark spirit - Van Pierre - and turned into a vampire.  The next night she returns to Patrick with Van Pierre.  Because of his soft feelings for Lori, he is rather easily turned into a creature of the night.  Patrick has always believed that hatred, disgust and apathy poison man's soul.  But he soon experiences hellish scenes so horrible that even a soulless vampire creature is sickened.  Despite his status as human stalker, Patrick retains a bit of his softness.  He lives by certain rules, refusing to kill families or children.  And he still loves Lori.  By night Patrick prowls for sustenance.  By day he is tormented by his vile demon keeper, Pink.  Tortures too graphically horrible to comprehend are inflicted in Pink's attempts to turn Patrick to Satan's way and break his spirit.  Patrick writes a journal in an attempt to purge the final ghastly cries of love from his black heart.  Simplicity is that journal.<br /><br />Scenes of graphic violence and vampire sexuality make this book too disturbing for sensitive readers or children.  I cannot recommend it for all, but will repeat that - despite the sometimes horrible depictions of Patrick's life - Mark Dirschel's writing is powerful.pirit.

If I had the contacts and the power to do so, this book would a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie.  It deserves that and much more because this story demonstrates the finest of what we all would like America and Americans to be.<br /><br />Maggie Claydon grew up in a Florida orphan's home with only the doting Francine Everhart as caregiver.  At age eighteen she goes out into the world to make her own way, knowing Mrs. Everhart is nearby to provide loving support.  When Maggie is twenty three, an official letter arrives from a New York City lawyer.  She's inherited property from grandparents that she did not know existed.  The property is run down, its residents all senior citizens with nowhere else to go.  Maggie rolls up her sleeves and digs in, determined that this neglected old building will be brought up to code, will shine again and that its inhabitants will feel secure and loved.<br /><br />Maggie is a thoroughly decent, compassionate girl.  Her innocence and generous hearted  turn makes every stranger want to be her friend.  NYPD Officer Sean Murphy thinks Maggie and her building code dilemma might be just the thing to bring his younger brother Jake back to life.  Jake's history is harrowing.  On Christmas, more than three years ago, Jake came home from cutting down a Christmas tree to find his wife and two young children had been brutally murdered.  Jake has comtemplated suicide, tried burying his horror in alcohol, and has withdrawn from everyone.  He's finally learned to hide his misery away, but life means nothing to him.  Sean urges him to help Maggie bring her tenement up to code.  After seeing what Maggie is up against and meeting the elderly residents, Jake reluctantly decides to do ONE GOOD DEED.  By book's end, everyone learns that good deeds - loving legacies - never die.  Love is returned in kind through small and large acts down through the generations.<br /><br />OK.  That sets up the story and it's all I'm telling you.  Read this book for yourself.  Maggie, Jake, and everyone else in The Legacy represent positive old fashioned values in a contemporary settiing.

Life's truths were discovered and shared while playing cards and mendng fences.  &quot;Running with Dogs&quot; and &quot;Teaching the Dawn&quot; revealed a man and his solitary musings.

Retired Special Forces Captain Ben Donovan runs across a failed hit on Rienzi's drug and money operation outside Wichita.  Donovan consults his long time pal, Ritter Vanlaar, a retired Special Forces Major.  Donovan and Vanlaar are black ops specialists, warriors of organized perfection who can and will do whatever is required to complete a mission or a goal.<br /><br />Our heroes are strapping corn fed Kansas males who don't take kindly to \\"Cocaine Cowboys\\" or demented misfits dirtying their home ground.  They are soon up to their winning smiles in unsavory sociopaths, foreign forces of assorted nationalities, the KGB, and a vicious deviant named The Yellow Rose.  The lovely Yellow Rose has parlayed her mob connections into a successful Great Plains drug trade and she doesn't suffer competition gladly.  Then there are the dirty cops, one of which has taken sexual sadism to new lows.  Unfortunately for this twisted cop-sadist, both Donovan and Vanlaar are men who genuinely like women.  Very soon, the \\"foul smelling brown stuff begins to hit the whirring blades\\" in Wichita.<br /><br />Mr. Gideon does a fine job of off setting violence with humor and giving his characters life.  Donovan and Vanlaar are as boyishly appealing as they are coldly ruthless when the chips are down.  These retired warriors have lost none of their potency in love or in war.  Samantha Warfield is especially believable as Vanlaar's long time one true love.  Kat Killeloe his current mistress is the type who fits well with such a man and her father Black Jack Killeloe is a delightful Irish rogue.<br /><br />Cast a Cold Eye goes beyond being a macho romp, although it is that.  The bad guys are so unsavory that their grisly and horrible ends met in the form of planned reprisal seem well-deserved.  Unapologetic good guys take delight in meting out such harsh reprisals.<br /><br />It's an exciting read and would make a whopper of a movie.

Neither story nor setting is pretty, but somehow this reader was enriched by the telling.<br /><br />Addie Myers is a scrawny ten year old orphan, dumped off on a brutish uncle in the early years of the dust bowl and depression.  Uncle Ira offers no creature comforts, no hope, and very little food to keep an unloved child alive.  And the good folks of Suicide Oklahoma prefer not to get involved.  Staunch Christian souls that they are, they know Addie's history and that her future will no doubt be as suspect as her past.  The hand of friendship is extended  only by Miss Eleanor at the general store, and an awkward boy named Tom.<br /><br />What little hope Tom has for a promising life away from Suicide is shattered in his youth.  And Addie lives a bare existence, trying to stay out of her loutish uncle's reach as she comes of age.  With nowhere to go and no one to guide or protect her, Addie silently seeks acceptance in the fields, birds, and animals, the prairie winds and skies.<br /><br />Spare blessings come in the form of Tom's love for a wild girl and her blossoming to the only tenderness she's ever known.  Not even the revelation of dark secrets or the shocking end of Return to Suicide negates the sweetness Tom and Addie share for a brief time.  I congratulate the author for making this story work, for bringing a sense of beauty out of hopelessness and dust.	2003-06-08

Those who have read the previous three books are no doubt like me, eager to learn the outcome of characters and storyline.  I'll try not to give away too many secrets or surprises.<br /><br />This time, Nouri Sommers is at loose ends.  Her husband Ethan has been killed, leaving her a very wealthy widow.  She and the sexy Homicide Detective Gabe Baldwin have had a serious falling out.  Gabe comes completely unstrung over their differences and his acting out behavior takes a direction I did not anticipate.  Her long time devoted friend and lover, Private Investigator Charles Mason, is slated to marry the mother of his son at last.  And just when I had hopes that everything would be OK, Nouri is seriously injured in a car wreck.<br /><br />One thing is certain.  The author kept me hanging until the very end.  All the loose ends were tied up and every question answered.  Those readers who have been entertained by the series and anticipated with relish each new installment no doubt had the same questions I did.  I'll list a few of the questions, but won't provide the answer.  It's the least I can do.<br />Will Nouri ever be happy with a man who loves her?  (That is, provided she survives the car wreck.)<br />Will Charles actually finally marry his fiancee and leave his love for Nouri behind?<br />Will Gabe straighten his act out and marry Nouri if she lives?<br />And what about high powered attorney Clint Chamberlain?  Is he really dead?  Will Nouri ever get him out of her system?<br />That's enough to contemplate for now.  Victoria Taylor-Murray did a good job with this sexy suspense series.  I wonder what she will come up with to tantalize her readers next?<br /><br />Not recommended to those under 18 due to strong sexual content.	2003-05-31

Homicide Detective Gabe Baldwin is still protecting Nouri Sommers from someone who wants her dead.  Despite his growing love for Nouri, Gabe is still fighting what he considers \\"forbidden fruit\\" - giving in to his desire for a woman loved by his best friend.  The disappearance of her husband, murders at Lambert, and knowing she has been betrayed by husband, friends, and lovers takes a harsh toll on Nouri.  She's beginning to see a pattern to her life and does not necessarily like what she sees.  The author does a good job of portraying Nouri's crisis of understanding.<br /><br />Her wealthy perverted husband is still missing.  From all evidence, his wealth has been ill-gotten by associating with evil men around the world.  Her best friend is plotting with a vicious killer to end Nouri's life.  The man she thought was the love of her life - Clint Chamberlain - is cavorting with a sexy beauty in France despite his recent protestations of undying love and promises to stop playing the field.  And the man she is beginning to love refuses to make love with her out of loyalty to his friend and fear that she will break his heart.  It's a frightening and frustrating time for Nouri.<br /><br />A few more loose ends are connected in Book Three of the Lambert Series.  Nouri inches closer to what may possibly be genuine love.  The devoted men in her life tolerate each other as \\"friendly enemies\\" to safeguard Nouri and her fortune.  And readers are left wondering what the clincher will be in the final chapter, Le Fin.  Until then, Ms. Murray keeps us all hanging, waiting for answers and wondering at the outcome.  Friendly Enemies is recommended for mature readers due to sexual situations.	2003-05-30

I couldn't help but think while reading it what a good movie it would make.  All the ingredients are at hand: interesting characters, with non-stop fright and suspense that plays well against the Heartland locale.  The prologue alone was enough to make my hair stand on end.<br /><br />Tony Parker is the very-married hero with a devoted wife, two small children, and a St. Bernard to round out his life.  Financial problems forced him to drop out of college one year short of his veterinary degree and he sees no way of completing that schooling any time soon.  Despite that, Tony has made a good living for himself as Animal Control Officer of Sedgwick County Kansas and the City of Wichita.  He's an organized and efficient boss with a deep love and respect for animals and is well respected by his supervisors and peers.  The worst danger he has to face is an occastional bite from an animal that might be rabid.  It would  be an idyllic set up if not for a couple unanticipated complications.<br /><br />Complication one.  Tony's a good looking guy, a fact not overlooked by his young assistant Sarah Hill.  She's made seducing the devoted family man her number one priority.  Tony loves his wife and is not the play-around type, but a little of the zip HAS gone out of his marriage and Sarah IS an eyeful and well, Tony is only human.  Sarah's selfish attempts at seduction turn out to be not so entertaining when all is said and done.<br /><br />Complication two.

Science, art, and the humanities are woven skillfully into this fictional story of learning, maturing, and friendship.  His well-developed characters represent the first generation who realized destruction of all life on Earth has become possible through nuclear means.<br /><br />C.J. Rongo is the inquisitive, idealistic  progeny of an equally idealistic father who died young.  C.J.'s father seemingly wills himself to die in the years following his military service.  In a poignant letter to his toddler son - saved for C.J. to read as he starts college - the elder Rongo states his generation has increased evil by glorifying war and abandoned the decency of their futures.  The college age C.J. has difficulty verbalizing an endless stream of  thoughts, scientific ideas, and life questions but he is far from ignorant.  Chapter One was difficult to follow at first, until I realized that this was my introduction to C.J. and his inability to express himself with eloquence.<br /><br />The character of Colin Tsampas is introduced quite effectively through journal writings kept from 1945 through 1975.  Colin is at first a student of psychiatry and then a practicing psychiatrist who simply cannot accept the times in which he lives.  He questions why mankind does not create life enhancing opportunities with and for each other.  His goal as a psychiatrist is to teach people how to be friends, how to care for one another, and how to love enduringly - traits seldom dealt with in human literature or education.<br /><br />Jack Tane is a law student struggling to make sense out of a world he cannot believe in.  His father is successful, old fashioned in the sense that he is an unquestioning patriot who supports political intrigue, war, and the American way of life to a maddening degree.  Jack's family life has been superficial, an endless empty charade.  Jack finds his upper middle class life unacceptable, and begins to question the wisdom of perpetuating such a life through the practice of law.  He feels no way of life could be good and necessary enough to protect with such savage possibilities - nuclear weapons.<br /><br />Leah Tetrao is ethereally lovely, desperate to make a lasting mark on the world through personal expression.  When acting does not produce the results she seeks, Leah turns to art as her medium.  Her parents are supportive, but their impending divorce is the final straw in an already unpredictable world.  The world she hoped to influence through her creativity no longer exists.<br /><br />Leah, C.J., Colin, and Jack are thrown together in sometimes uneasy alliances as they all four separately and together seek an acceptable reality.  Goals and hopes are thrown off balance in the turmoil that was the 1960s in America.  The looming threat of nuclear holocaust, the snuffing out in rapid succession of JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and the VietNam conflict take a lasting toll on four friends who cannot or will not adapt to such national horrors.<br /><br />C.J. does not want to take courses in subjects he cannot personally care about.  He finds life too complicated and drops out of one course after another.  His relationship with Leah suffers because of his confusion.<br />Colin lives in despair due to his belief that man should be fighting the enemies we all share - hunger, cold, disease - instead of destroying each other.  Jack's mind and health are nearly destoyed by his dawning realization that he cannot change the world, and learning an awful truth about his family.  In C.J.'s practical approach to life and living, Jack finally finds personal peace.  Leah finds her own peace in solitary protest, motherhood, and artistic expression.<br /><br />I found How Did That Sun Get Out to be engrossing in a cryptic way I cannot explain.  The characters were well developed and the writing sometimes breath taking.  But nothing has really changed since the 1960s, politically or otherwise.  War machines still make war seem patriotic and right.  Despite medical and scientific advances, humans still suffer disease and starvation in a world awash in money, medicine, and food.  I could not help but wonder at the end of this book, what C.J., Jack, Colin, and Leah must be thinking today.nged since the 1960s, politically or otherwise.

Foertmeyer and it won't be the last.  His books are always imaginative and well written, complete with excitement, danger, and life lessons as a subtle part of every story.<br /><br />Alex Carey and Bender Baxter are teenage friends.  They live in a small Idaho town bordering on forested wilderness.  One day while swimming in the river, Alex drowns and Bender cannot save him.  An unexpected and miraculous rescue occurs, and Alex is discovered alive days later.  Both boys set out to find whoever saved Alex from death.  Their search takes them deep into primeval forest, and a world no one could possibly believe exists today.<br /><br />Jubel Owens is a hermit like his father before him.  Half Indian and half white, he prefers his life in the peaceful forest, away from the modern world.  Still, he befriends Alex and Bender and helps them understand the mystery they uncover on their trek.<br /><br />The Atiri are throwbacks to an ancient time before the white man threatened their existence.  Although different from native Indians and modern man, the Atiri have their own language and way of life, are compassionate and devoted to their families.  Jubel, Alex, and Bender finally meet Bersh, the male Atiri who rescued Alex and nursed him back to health.  Bersh has a wife named Brish, and a son named Besh.  The adventure proceeds as planned until two teenagers named Dirk and Carter stumble onto Besh and shoot him.  From that point, less than kindly townfolk get involved in searching for the Atiri.  Jubel and his young friends have their hands full in protecting the Atiri and preventing the world from invading their home.<br /><br />Along the way, lives and attitudes are changed.  New alliances and friendships are formed.  And good behavior wins out over bad.  With C.H. Foertmeyer, each book is a new adventure.  The American wilderness and human nature are portrayed as what they were and are.  This author's books are appropriate for both adult and young adult readers.

This book was well written and engrossing from page one, complete with murders, mystery, miracles and love.  I could barely stand to put it down.<br /><br />Bethany Bridgewater is an independent woman, calm, capable and centered.  Her engagement to Brad Quinn is not the joyous time it should be.  Neither Brad nor her parents approve of Bethany's angel store.  Brad is a gloriously handsome devil, but his desire for the reluctant Bethany is brushed off at every turn.  His touch does nothing for her.  When Bethany's family is murdered, it is not Brad who stands by to lend moral support, but Adam Addison her father's lawyer.  Adam has long been hopelessly enamored of Bethany but has kept those feelings private.<br /><br />Bethany's twin Andrea has always believed herself to be the black sheep of the family.  Andrea is stylish, flamboyant, and flaunts her beauty for all to see and appreciate.  Her career as an \\"actress\\" in LA is not exactly something to be proud of.  When Andrea returns home for her family's funeral, she and Brad are drawn together like [] magnets.<br /><br />The murderer remains hidden from readers, but we get a glimpse into his or her troubled mind through thoughts.  The author handles this part well and builds suspense effectively by interspersing the killer's thoughts with action and dialog.  Both Bethany and Andrea are in danger, as well as their ten year old sister Courtney.  Courtney survived a bullet to her brain, but lingers in a coma.  I was not prepared for the miracles, or for the shocking ending.  Ms. Scott took me by surprise.<br /><br />If you like mystery, suspense, love, and a well crafted story, read this book  The author has a new book out that I am eager to read.  There is some sexual content in Righteous Revenge, so it is not appropriate for the young or immature.  Otherwise I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hearty read.	2003-05-08

God's fallen angel doesn't have much going for him, really, except his reign in hell, and the wily old demon is not about to give it up without a fight.  The lesser demon Babbas swears he can defeat the reigning Prince of Darkness by delivering the soul of an angel.  The challenge is accepted and the fight is on.<br /><br />Barney Schmidt is a kindly railroad conductor planning on early retirement.  The love of his life - his wife Hannah - has a bad heart and won't live beyond a few more months.  Barney is retiring and cashing in every investment and pension fund to take a trip with Hannah while she can still enjoy it.  Except for the loss of an infant son long ago, their life together has been blessed.  Barney is a simple man with a heart of gold.  When he discovers Matt, an 8-year old runaway orphan hiding on the train, he pretends Matt is his nephew and plans to take him home to Hannah.<br /><br />Matt, of course, is Babbas in disguise and Barney is soon to become the angel soul he seeks to destroy.  Barney is killed trying to protect Matt during a train wreck, and the struggle between Lucifer and Babbas begins.  Lucifer is forced to play the good guy in this tale.  Unless he can save Barney's soul from Babbas, Lucifer will lose the challenge.<br /><br />Ms. Hartman has a flair for imaginative story telling.  She has a long history of creative writing and that experience shows in her first novel.	2003-05-07

Nouri is a somewhat trusting and ingenuous heroine who finds herself embroiled in several layers of deception.  Her inattentive, drug addicted and twisted billionaire husband Ethan has disappeared without a trace.  Two old lovers who cannot seem to get her out of their systems - attorney Clint Chamberlain and investigator Charles Mason - are jockeying for her favors.  And to top it all off, a man who shows all signs of being her one true soul mate enters the picture.  Gabe Baldwin is the friend and ex-partner of Charles Mason, and a homicide detective in Boston.  And all this plays out against the privileged backdrops of Lambert, Boston, London and Paris.<br /><br />Unsolved murders that suggest Nouri's involvement are just the tip of the iceberg in Forbidden.  The Chinese Mob rears its ugly head, stalking Nouri for unknown reasons.  Friends turn against friends in vicious retributions for past imagined sins.<br />Even Gabe Baldwin's considerable skill is not enough to protect her from the double dealing friends and enemies that stalk her.  Gabe is a man of honor, determined to avoid what he considers to be \\"forbidden fruit\\" as his attraction for Nouri eases into love.  Gabe's tortured character was my favorite, but Ms. Murray does a grand job of developing all of her interesting characters.<br /><br />I'll simply have to read the next two books in the Lambert Series now.  The author left me hanging, curious, wondering how these threads would be connected in the end.  Will Nouri survive?  Will truth, honor, and justice prevail?  Will Gabe's pain be eased or must he suffer all his life?  I can't wait to find out!<br /><br />Recommended for mature readers due to strong sexual content.	2003-05-05

Along with those credentials, he has had more than twenty books of poetry published, writes screenplays, reviews and critiques the work of others.  I hesitated at first to say he seemed like a Renaissance man to me, until I learned he also created the words and music to an operetta.  I can use that designation now without hesitation.  What Poetry is All About is a compilation of essays that reflect his gift for words.  I expected this to be a college textbook - dry and tedious - but found it helpful, humorous, sensible, nonsensical in places, and an all around enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Regarding American poetry, the author states it &quot;speaks where it might have sung.&quot;  He also laments that poets are not heard, except by each other.  Regrettably, that may be true.  He asks the reader, &quot;Who if not you will read, or hear, and love and know these lonely inadvertent cries?&quot;<br /><br />Kuzma defines poetry as, &quot;A disease.  A fever which while it wastes and dissipates fulfills.  The opiate of the bored and intellectual.  A sullen art.  A lonely business.  Suicide with a hairbrush.&quot;  I'm sure most poets would relate, especially the hairbrush part.<br /><br />The author shares why editors reject or accept manuscripts, how to win readers, and what the poet's job entails.  He also spells out clearly what he looks for when he reads, reviews, or critiques poetry:  a dancing grace; a leisurely pace; insightful purpose; words spelled right; to be surprised a little at a time.<br /><br />In the essay on publishers, even his tongue in cheek wit could not disguise the truth.  Ditto his essay on careers in poetry.  His hard won truths can be boiled down to few words:  You won't win prestigious awards and monied prizes so don't count on it.<br /><br />A man who knows, understands, and loves the written word authored this book.  Even the humor was well-crafted.  Poet Song was my favorite essay. Greg Kuzma is a wordsmith.Poet Song was my favorite essay. Greg Kuzma is a wordsmith.	2003-05-05

I lingered over every word of this enigmatic and compelling first novel by Barry Patrick Fitzsimmons.  His fictional characters were dead-on perfect, as was the milieu he invented for them.<br /><br />Roland Spring is the hapless hero of Life Askew, a veritable walking, talking epitome of the title.  Roland has had a sinus condition all his life, along with an inner ear abberance that causes him to list sideways with the tides.  He's learned to live with it, and the sometimes unkind comments that come of his odd appearance.  Roland is educated, but a man of simple hopes and dreams.  Life in the decaying and unsavory metropolis of Cosmette has not yet jaded our innocent hero.  He works the graveyard shift with pride at a one-of-a-kind supermarket.  He gives himself for the good of the company, imagining that he will one day be a MANAGER at Food Expo.<br /><br />At 21-years old, Roland is a loner, an outcast among his peers, a virgin who dreams of sexual intimacy with another human being.  His sexual fantasies come true in the form of an inventive young lady named Mynewt who slips in and out of his bed at first, then later comes to stay.  His life is bliss with Mynewt in his bed.  With tender hopes and growing confidence, Roland begins to climb the ladder of success at Food Expo.  But with a female in his life and increased responsibilities at work, harsh truths reveal themselves.<br /><br />The world is greedy.  It runs on money.  And Roland is surrounded by double dealing miscreants.  His minimalist existence is over.  He's forced to deal with faxes and voicemail, bosses who demand every last bit of his energy and mess with his long held beliefs of honesty and personal best.  We all sell out eventually in one way or another, even Roland Spring.  There is no soft landing for Roland when he finally falls from grace.  Men he considered friends ensure his downfall<br /><br />In the end, the mysterious Mr. Hellandback talks with the ruined innocent and assures him another day will come.  Readers who pore over every word, as I did, will remember the hand Mr. Hellandback took in Roland's early life and be chilled by this conversation.  Ultimately, Cosmette citizens experience a collective Armageddon while Roland resumes his simple existence.<br /><br />This review barely scratches the surface of Life Askew.. From the names this author gives his characters, to the situations he creates for them, every page was cram-full of insights and surprises.  There were moments of irreverent hilarity, and revelatory visions of humans forced to live in a less than perfect world.

Volume II relies less on technical and scientific data - although that ground is covered in effective and interesting ways - and more on Neanderthal interaction with Homo Sapiens and their two very different worlds.<br /><br />Ponter Boddit, the Neanderthal physicist, is reunited with the paleoanthropologist Mary Vaughan and made an official envoy to the parallel world she lives in.  Despite polluted air, filthy cities, and human over-population, Ponter sees a goodness in his Homo Sapien counterparts.  He believes there is hope for their world, and that both Mary's people and his can benefit each other with their knowledge.  To that end, he and his friend Adikor create another portal and figure out a way to keep it open, more or less permanently.<br /><br />To Mary's way of thinking, Ponter is a gentle hearted man, quite appealing in his guileless fascination with her world.  This time around, Ponter learns a great deal more about Homo Sapiens and their history.  He's shocked to witness the results of terrorism and war, horrified to learn that millions died in battle, and infuriated to know that Mary's rapist has thus far gone unpunished.  And Two finally become One - Ponter's euphemism for making love - on a night that both he and Mary find educational and immensely satisfying.  New relationships are formed and old ones shattered as Ponter accepts that he's in love with a female not of his species.<br /><br />Jealousies and very human failings are acted out on both sides of the portal.  Mary visits Ponter's world, enthralled by the peace and untainted atmosphere she finds there.  And Ponter demonstrates Neanderthal justice in a way no rapist could ever forget.  All in all, it was a fascinating read as explorations and information gathering between the worlds begins.<br /><br />As is Mr. Sawyer's hallmark, Humans is well-researched and written with panache.  The Neanderthal Parallax is fantasy that reads as very real.  I highly recommend it to mature adolescents and adults.  (There is some strong sexual content in this book.)  Volume III is due out in September.  That's too long to wait.  The name alone promises an exciting finale - Hybrids.ads as very real.  I highly recommend it to mature adolescents and adults.

I devoured the book, sympathized and empathized with the characters, and eagerly anticipate beginning Volume II.  Be prepared to make an emotional connection you did not expect.  This work of science fiction is beguiling, and the story teller masterful.<br /><br />Ponter Boddit is a physicist still grieving over the loss of his wife.  Humorous and gentle hearted, he now shares a home with his long time friend and colleague, Adikor Huld.  Adikor is the computer genius who brings Ponter's quantum physics theories to life.  Both men are Neanderthals, living in a world where humans as we know them went extinct before recorded time.  When their latest experiment unexpectedly succeeds, Ponter is transported into a parallel world - modern day Canada - where he is first rescued, then nurtured by curious strangers.<br /><br />Louise Benoit works far below earth's surface in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory complex.  When a Neanderthal in modern dress materializes out of nowhere into a tank of heavy water, she and her colleagues rescue him from drowning first and ask questions later.  She and the company doctor, Reuben Montego, rush the strange specimen to the hospital and then begin to evaluate their situation.  X-rays prove that they do, indeed, have a fully developed Neanderthal man on their hands.  They call in one of the world's most honored paleoanthropologists in the field of Neanderthal research, Dr. Mary Vaughan.  When DNA sampling proves that Ponter is genetically Neanderthal, Louise, Reuben and Mary band together to protect him and learn more about his world.  Meanwhile, in his parallel universe, Adikor is up on murder charges because of Ponter's sudden disappearance.<br /><br />It all seems so incredible, but from page one this author makes it work beautifully.  The bewildered Ponter learns to like and respect his Homo Sapiens counterparts.  They in turn appreciate and admire his intelligence and personality.  Before long, the differences between Neanderthal and modern human fade, replaced by friendship and a growing fondness between Ponter and Mary, made more poignant by her history with males.<br /><br />The contrast between Ponter's world and ours was indelibly detailed in Hominids.  Ours is noisy and messy, with vehicles roaring and factories belching foul smoke.  His is quiet and peaceful by design, where wooly mammoths graze quietly outside his bedroom window and violence is rare.  Ponter's sorrow on learning that most of the familiar animals in his world have been hunted to extinction in ours was heart breaking.<br /><br />In short, yes, Mr. Sawyer drew me into this science fiction fantasy and the lives of his characters.  Technically precise background information aside, it was the humans in this story who kept me reading.  I'm hoping Humans, Volume II, will pick up where Hominids left off.

What makes this second book different is the extra added spice of romance.  That's right.  Macho good guy action, seriously bad bad guys, and romance all rolled into one tight package.  I enjoyed it!<br /><br />Jon Roman runs a successful firm that can and does investigate or research anything his clients need doing.  The handsome and self-confident Roman comes from an accomplished military background.  What he can't do himself is reliably accomplished by his friends Buck Winston and Maxwell Funk.  The skirt chasing but skilled Buck and the computer geek / hacker Max work hand in glove with Jon on every project.<br /><br />When Dr. Brianne Richard hires Jon to solve her mother's twenty-year-old murder, that's when [everything] breaks loose both literally and figuratively.  Brianne sets off quiet fireworks in Jon from minute one, and she is not immune to his masculine good looks and quiet strength.  It might have been a match made in heaven from first meeting, if not for fighting for their lives.<br /><br />...In Den of Deception, nothing is what it seems. Tangled cover-ups that date back to World War Two, dark family secrets, and a complex mystery set the pace.  It's not a good time for the capable Jon Roman to have his mind on the pretty surgeon if he wants them both to survive.<br /><br />The author does  quiet macho heroes and contemptible bad guys very well.  Action and intrigue is Richard Alan Nelson's hallmark.  That he has added romance - and done a fine job of it - brings tasty flavor to an already fine mix.  Good job, Mr. Nelson.  Bring on number three!	2003-03-22

From the erin green covers to the morsels of his memories within them, the author serves himself up to the reader like a meat and potatoes stew.  Alternately dark with pathos, then light with sudden bursts of humor, this story lives.  The author's way with words is purely Irish, through and through.<br /><br />His San Francisco home is shared by an old country grandfather who worked hard and proud to make America his home; a calm and sensible grandmother who unfailingly nurtures all three men she loves; and a handsome father who works and pays the bills despite his losing battle with the demon drink. Moving in and out of the Michael's life are kinfolk who are all apples off the same Irish tree, each with their own personality and contribution to the author's childhood memories.  A mother who abandoned her Irish Catholic husband and infant in search of fun is an occasional visitor, a mystery throughout the author's life.<br /><br />Mr. Corrigan cooks up a fine, rich broth with his memories.  I was intrigued by his family, his lifelong friends, the nuns who taught him as a child, and the priests who took him from innocent altar boy to a manhood full of doubt about his faith.  A genetic love of drink plagues him from early on.  His struggle with the Irish Catholic faith is honestly relayed through thoughts or spoken words.  And his appreciation of the fair sex is sometimes humorous or sad.  But it was the author's relationship with his father that, for me at least, put the shine on this novel.  His father dies young, a dissipated remnant of the once darkly handsome charismatic man who raised his son without a mother.  The author's memory of that day haunts me:<br /><br />\\"The old days of Irish wakes with ice lifted off the corpse for drinks had passed.  Now it was only a rosary, and relatives listened to the priest reciting before the open coffin.  I wondered if the Vikings weren't right to put the body on a ship and riddle the vessel with fire arrows, rather than lay the body out for morbid viewing.

Where was the person who took the wheel of his brother's boat and waved at the home movie lens?  When would we hear that warm baritone again with its Bing Crosby resonance?\\"<br /><br />Confessions of a Shanty Irishman is selling well and finding an audience.  Deservedly so.

And I don't mean strictly Christian inspiration, although it is that too.  This is an amazing first person story.<br /><br />From childhood, the author struggled with epilepsy of the petit mal type.  It was a bleak existence for a child, with little support or understanding from family or peers.  She grew up thinking epilepsy was a shameful thing, a condition to hide, one that made her past, present and future hopeless.  Doctors medicated her, sometimes to the point of toxicity, and told her there was nothing they could do.  Not until college years when she met her future husband did Stephanie feel safe, loved, and accepted.<br /><br />Despite her husband's love and support, life does not get easier.  Her study of and love for music is put on hold.  Children come along, financial worries threaten.  And through it all, the spectre of \\"seizure invasion\\" looms, to strike with regularity.  When she meets a special doctor with a positive persona, her life is changed.  Surgery turns out to be the godsend he has promised it would be in her case.<br />Life looks brighter for awhile, despite setbacks.  The blessing of a nurturing mentor with a can do attitude leads the author back to the music she always loved.  She resurrects her musical artistry and pours it into passion borne of pain.<br /><br />Facing Me documents one woman's trials, defeats, and triumphs with painful honesty.  If you struggle with epilepsy, or know someone who does, I recommend you read this book.  Or if you simply enjoy well written non-fiction, give Facing Me a try.	2003-03-19

Move over Danielle Steele and Grace Metalious and make room for your new rival.  I know mentioning Grace Metalious dates me, but she was after all the one time reigning queen of sizzling sex and quirky characters.  And Grace has nothing on this author.<br /><br />Upscale East Bay Lambert sets the locale for this first in Ms. Murray's Lambert Series.  This chic haven for the very rich offers everything that jaded appetites might want and more.  Scandalous behavior is the norm, and intemperance in all activities is encouraged.  Everything from drug and alcohol excesses to swinging or perverted lifestyles are overlooked at Lambert.<br /><br />Nouri Sommers is somewhat of a lamb amidst the pack of wealthy jackals who frequent Lambert.  She has past loves but is now very married to the handsome and powerful Ethan, with just one little problem.  The sexy Ethan isn't quite as sexy as he looks.  At least, not where his young bride is concerned.  Night after night she sits alone in their huge mansion, pouring her heart out in a journal to ease her loneliness and longing for her husband.  Lonely bride + inattentive husband is bad enough, but add in two men who adore Nouri and the mix turns spicy.  Clint Chamberlain is Ethan's lawyer, nursing a secret passion for Nouri.  He's more than up to the task at hand, but will Nouri stray?  And then there is Charles Mason, the private eye Nouri hires to track her errant hubby's activities.  That Mason is her one-time lover only adds fuel to the already combustible cast of characters.  And I haven't even mentioned Clint's mentally deranged wife, Becka, or Nouri's best friend, the deceitful Genna.<br /><br />Before the last page, new relationships will be established and some will end in murder.  Nothing is really resolved for Nouri or her dashing suitors.  You'll have to read book two in the Lambert series if you want answers.  That's what I intend to do!<br /><br />Recommended for mature readers due to strong sexual content.	2003-03-16

This is the second C.H. Foertmeyer book I've read and won't be the last.  The way he tells a story is distinctly his own, and I like the way his mind works - \\"outside the box.\\"<br /><br />This unusual tale begins when Jim Preston finds an old map sealed in a mason jar while he's out metal detecting.  The map is of Father Mountain in Colorado and an area named Cat's Lair.  Jim Preston lives in Illinois and is so intrigued by the map that he decides a road trip is in order.  His pal since childhood, Red Porter, takes time off work and tags along for the ride.  In a sleepy little burg named Clermont, the friends stop to eat at the Hummingbird Cafe and meet a lovely young woman named Laura.  Despite being a local, she knows nothing of the Cat's Lair but has hiked and camped on Father Mountain often.  Jim and Red are decent, friendly sorts, so she agrees to guide them in their search.<br /><br />The author does not keep his readers hanging long before the mystery of Cat's Lair is revealed.  In a deep pristine forest that looks like man never stepped foot in it, the map leads them to their destination.  The three adventurers breathe air untainted by the modern world, drink pure sweet water from a crystal lake, and stumble onto a realm hidden since time began.<br /><br />An invisible portal leads Jim and Red into a secret world, manned by beings with powers beyond human comprehension.  A benign Father - God?  An Alien? - has placed these Observers and Guardians of the Kindred on Father Mountain from the day of Creation.  Inside Cat's Lair, time is concentric, curvilinear, converging on itself in ways Jim and Red cannot decipher at first.  They move forward and backward in time, searching for their own existence while Laura waits, lives out her life, and finally dies in old age without ever seeing them again.  And that is just the beginning of this tale!<br /><br />Except for some mild swear words, The Cat's Lair is suitable reading for teenagers and adults.  The cover is sturdy and attractive and the print easy to read ...<br />Good job, Mr. Foertmeyer!  What's the next intriguing subject in your writer's repertoire?/>Except for some mild swear words, The Cat's Lair is suitable reading for teenagers and adults.

Recruited at a very young age while in military service, for twenty years he has served his country well, without complaint.  His cover is as a lifer, imprisoned for murder.  Not even his parents know Dakota's situation is a lie concocted by the Feds.  To them, he's always been a loving boy and man, intelligent and calm at the center, not the sort of man who would murder anyone.<br /><br />Dakota makes the most of a solitary life.  His existence isn't all that bad.  He creates beauty out of wood and precious metal with his hands in the prison shop, and loves his parents from a distance as best he can.  Agent Deer is focused and respected by peers and prisoners alike, and is the only undercover operative answerable directly to the President of the United States.  Dakota fulfills every covert assignment given by his President, then returns to prison to resume his act as convicted felon.<br /><br />Dawn Brown is trapped in an abusive marriage.  Gone are her hopeful high school days when she and her friend Dakota Deer held hands and talked for hours.  Except for four sweet children, all marriage ever got for Dawn was beatings, broken bones and violent sexual assaults.  Tom Brown is a master of mind control and manipulation.  He's decided Dawn should die to make room for the next Mrs. Brown.  Dawn isn't as dumb as her husband thinks, and escapes with her children to make a better life somewhere.  She finds a job, secures a home, and hopes for a brighter future.<br /><br />Dawn and Dakota begin writing each other after years of having no contact.  Despite his being in prison for life, Dawn is attracted to the gentle loving spirit of the man.  To her detractors, her answer is that she's never felt more loved by any other man in her life.  Dakota is very quickly in over his head, remembering the sweet young girl he loved in silence as a teenager.  Everything he does as man or Agent is soon focused on making life secure and safe for Dawn and her children.<br /><br />The author has created a sweet love story between two decent people.  The unusual premise was handled nicely, and all loose ends were tied up in a very heart warming and satisfying way.  Good job, Ms. DeLore!awn and her children.<BR> <BR>The author has created a sweet love story between two decent people.

With that metaphor of the buttercup, Nancy Marie shares with readers her journey to the Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.  As the simple buttercup takes time to grow and flourish before it can reflect the sunlight, so must a Christian grow in Jesus over time.  The author makes her message clear:  The journey may be difficult, but the end result is worth whatever struggles we experience!<br /><br />The buttercup is often thwarted in its growth by clouds, storms, and spattered mud.  In like fashion, the Christian's walk with Jesus can be halted by our very human failings.  Using scripture and examples from her own life, the author demonstrates that stubbornness and pride, judgmental thoughts and greed can block the Son from our lives in the same way clouds prevent the buttercup from thriving.  Until we free ourselves of self-serving traits, Jesus cannot be in us, shining through us onto others.  The light of Jesus must be reflected in us before our lives can positively impact the world.<br /><br />The process Nancy Marie struggled through to reach the Sonlight is likened to a jeweler refining silver.  Patiently, the jeweler smelters silver down repeatedly, removing the dross with every firing.  He does this until his reflection shows quite clearly in the silver.  In such a way, through trials and troubles, Jesus cleanses us of our impurities so His reflection shows in us.<br /><br />Nancy Marie makes her points lovingly and backs them up with scriptural truths:  Her words will comfort readers.  Jesus understands and empathizes with our human failings.  He has compassion for us, dispenses mercy and forgiveness with a generous heart.  Such generosity is love in action.  Only when we reflect what Jesus stands for can we call ourselves His people.<br /><br />I recommend this book to Christians, or those who might be searching for answers that will benefit their lives.l benefit their lives.	2003-03-16

Not only did this author attack sacred cows we taxpayers have long suspected to be less than sacred, but he did it with logical and engrossing prose.  Three detailed appendices and a seven-page bibliography support his contention that we've all been \\"bushwhacked\\" by experts at the game.<br /><br />Fred Dungan is a obvously a self-reliant man who takes his responsibilities as a citizen seriously.  His avowed belief  is that we are all bound by law and honor to keep our house in order.  By \\"house\\", he means his house, my house, your house and our common home, the United States of America.  The evidence he sets forth proves rather disturbingly that we have not been paying close enough attention to our obligations as Americans.<br /><br />From the national heartbreak of September 11 to environmental nightmares, from homeless two-job families to the legislators who feather their own plush nests in perpetuity, from women in the military to the Enron scandal, Mr. Dungan leaves no dirtied rock unturned.  And he pulls no punches.  He asks hard questions and provides answers that inform and outrage.  Among the questions he asked that I found most intriguing were:<br />Exactly WHO is really responsible for postal workers \\"going postal\\"?<br />Are our brains being short-circuited by technology?<br />What would we do if the social order in America suddenly crumbled?<br />What is the ONE WORD that set back 200 years the freedoms of human rights and religion in the USA?  (I'll give you a hint.  WACO.)<br />Do we LIKE being misgoverned, misrepresented and systematically fleeced by corrupt and money grubbing politicians, and do we even care enough about our land and the people in it to stop them?<br />Do citizens ignore the damaging effect of soft money because we have grown complacent from soft living?<br />There's much more to Bushwhacked than this small attempt at a lucid review.  Very little escapes the microscope the author forces us to look through.  It was well-written and honest.  I applaud the messenger and his powerful message. In my opinion, this book was well worth the read.lucid review.  Very little escapes the microscope the author forces us to look through.  It was well-written and honest.

The option you prefer should tell you whether you are a part of the solution, or the problem faced by the Earth of our time.<br />In this fascinating tale about the last days of Atlantis, Solara Vayanian draws chilling similarities between that ancient culture and our world today.  America, especially, should heed her words.  Once a shining beacon to the known world, Atlantis courted its own destruction, just as America is today.  Make no mistake.  The ancient primordial powers of darkness and light are doing battle in the world around us.  Good versus evil.  The author speaks with thrilling prose and stunning universal truths in an effort to get our attention.  World events are leading to another cataclysm.<br />The characters are compelling and charismatic.  Despite the power of loving priestesses and wise priests, Atlantis is in its last discordant days.  Light-filled Atlantians and Orion's Lords of Light are pitted against greedy, power seeking subjects in Atlantis who work in tandem with the Dark Lords of Rigel.  Evil comes in clever disguises - shape shifters, abominations of nature, and evil Zenetrians - bent on claiming every known galaxy as their own.<br />The people of Atlantis had drifted from days of glory towards mediocrity.  They had forgotten how to live in harmony with the land.  Their bodies, minds, and spirits were no longer in tune as they had been once.  Integrity and unity in the populace as a whole had become conflict and chaos.  They had forgotten how to embrace themselves with joy and radiate the peace of unconditional love.  Sound familiar?  Atlantis caused its own demise.  Will we?  The light of love unending is the answer.  Can we heed it?  Love is the only true healer.  Are we capable of believing that?<br />The author's descriptive passages are top rate, and her characters imaginative.  There are lessons to be learned in Time Out of Mind, and converts to be won by the Powers of Light.  I hope Ms. Vayanian and her sisters prevail.and her characters imaginative.

It speaks to the very human insecurities that trap us in defeated lives.  Digesting the message of Ms. Daniels' captivating first book was a real eye opener!  From the beginning of her novel to the unanticipated ending, I was hooked.<br /><br />Three months a widow, Keri Anders sells her home in Upstate New York and moves to Florida at the urging of a friend.  From day one, Florida is anything but the land of sunshine.  Keri is plagued with one setback after another, until an accident lands her in the office of Dr. David Chipperton.<br />Curly hair and twinkling hazel eyes aside, his persona seems familiar.  Keri is a poet, a writer, as was Chip's departed mother.  She's delighted when the handsome doctor hires her to edit his mother's writings and mentor his own.<br /><br />Keri and Chip have more in common than her injury and his dreams of writing.  Their spirits are connected through time, familiar and beloved.  The fact that Chip is married to a wealthy socialite has very little to do with their relationship.  Keri is well-read, intelligent and gifted.  Chip sees unconditional love and commitment in this woman with qualities.<br /><br />How the author spins this tale of love between an insecure woman and her solace-seeking lover is what impressed me.  Ms. Daniels writes well and kept me reading with delicious anticipation.  Along the way, Keri's spirit gains the strength it always lacked and she becomes a woman capable of anything she can imagine doing or being.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, The Woman with Qualities transcends romance.  You'll have to read it for yourself to understand the secrets I chose not to reveal.  I recommend it to mature readers.	2003-02-12

Johnson for Midwest Book Review	Back in the 1820s, when this country was young and wild, families like the VanFells headed west.  From their comfortable homes in the civilized east, they went into unknown territory with no advance information to prepare them for life in the wilderness.  It is only due to courage, adaptability, and inborn strength that the VanFells survive at all.<br /><br />Brian Seifrit has created a frightening and eerie introduction to the VanFell family saga.  They are beset by wolves, vicious raging blizzards and below zero weather, starvation, life threatening injuries, and diseases they are ill-prepared to handle.  They are stalked by an evil tribe of Indian cannibals, and befriended by kindly natives who assist in their survival.  Behind every new friendship established, and each triumph and tragedy the VanFells experience, looms the spectre of a horrible condition known by locals as \\"flesh craves\\".  Once infected with this terrible disease, man and beast must devour flesh and blood to survive.  And only a long dead shaman from a friendly tribe knew the secret cure for this affliction.<br /><br />As I said at the beginning, Flesh Craves introduces the VanFells and their friends and sets the tone for future sequels.  These sequels will no doubt take the reader deeper into horror and, hopefully, reveal the solution to the flesh craving disease that haunts the VanFell clan.  A sequel is in the works, and I can't wait to read it!	2003-02-04

What distinguishes it from others of its type is the author's ability as writer.  William Reid is a VERY good writer who tells a story in engaging style.<br /><br />Darren Freeman is 17 years old and heading down a destructive path.  The product of an upper middle class family, Darren is a \\"pot head\\" who doesn't seem to give a damn about anything but smoking dope and defying or embarrassing his social climbing parents.<br /><br />Carrie Spears is main \\"caretaker\\" of irresponsible, alcoholic parents.  At 17, all she can remember is cleaning up vomit and the messes created by the adults in her world.  Life has not been pretty or easy for Carrie, and she trusts no one but herself.  Life at home and on the streets has hardened her to everything and everyone.<br /><br />As a last ditch effort to change their outlooks, Darren and Carrie's parents send them to the Grizzly Bear Adventure Outings in the Alaskan wilderness.  Camp Counselor Gary Cornwall is a military wannabe who uses shock tactics as a means of bringing rebellious teenagers to heel.  He is not a man Darren and Carrie find easy to like or respect, and Cornwall soon finds he's bitten off more than he can chew with these two strong-willed teens.  When Darren and Carrie escape the camp and strike out on their own, Cornwall fails to track them down and they are left on their own to survive the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />The tale this author spins is an exciting one, about two fearless teens who work together as a team to survive and finally thrive as human beings.  Their respect for each other's strengths and weaknesses is touching and uplifting.  Whatever nature throws at them - bears and freezing blizzards, near mortal wounds or icy rivers - these two young people take in stride and face together.  Love blooms, but is mutually put on hold because survival is their foremost common goal.  From Alaskan natives who befriend them, they discover universal truths that give their lives fuller meaning:<br />  1.  Alaska and the world have become a zoo the white man left by accident.<br />  2.  The killing of animals is not glorious but a necessity to feed humans.

David Bulley tells his story in third person - with panache - but with an intimacy that made me feel a part of everything.<br /><br />Eddy Licklighter is a common man, soft hearted and humorous.  Friends and acquaintances can't help but like the man.  Eddy has simple hopes and dreams.  Those dreams include a firm belief in God's miracles and blessings.  He's happy with his lot, and does his best to make the most of what he has.  He loves his wife and adores his little girl.  Something breaks in Eddy when his wife and daughter are burned up in a house fire before his eyes.  Friends can't believe that Eddy can still smile and share his sense of humor after such a loss.  But behind that smile lives fiery rage, rage against the God who allows all thing horrible and heart breaking to happen.<br /><br />Eddy buys a bed and breakfast in the shadow of Mount Katahdin with his wife's insurance money.  He hires Melinda, a Native American straight off the Reservation to run it for him.  In and out of Eddy's life move his friends Dan and Chief of Police Bruce Telyawhig.  Added into this odd mix are Paul, a Baptist minister, and Stephen, a young gay man in search of safety and acceptance.  Paul has left his church in disgrace when he's discovered in a sexual situation with a teenage boy.  Fate brings him to Eddy's bed and breakfast and enlightenment.<br /><br />Eddy's plan is to destroy God fast and neat.  The world, according to Eddy, would be a happier simpler place without God in it.  The more Eddy blasphemes and rages in the face of God, the more things go his way.  He figures God is trying to win him over after stealing everything Eddy holds dear.  Still, everywhere he looks is death and poison in the world, awful misery that God allows to happen.  Eddy says a resounding no to such a God, no to every question God ever asked and every suggestion He'd ever made.  His friends love Eddy, believe in him, including Paul.  Paul learns lessons of \\"pleasurable destruction\\" from Eddy - smoking, drinking beer, giving God the finger both literally and figuratively.  He buys into Eddy's wry philosophy:  \\"Just when things get from horrible to tolerable, just when you start to figure something out about life, God screws you over again.\\"<br /><br />Eddy's master plan is to kill God and then kill himself.  How this plan plays out is both funny and heart rending.  I don't want to give it all away.  Let's just say that in the end, Eddy understands truths that humans this side of the veil cannot know and should not judge.<br /><br />The premise is different than anything  I ever read, and author Bulley masterful.  Staunch Christians may not see beyond the blasphemy.  The stark sexual and sometimes violent content are portrayed realistically, along with language some may find offensive.  But the meat of the story itself is thought-provoking and sometimes beautiful.  If you want something different, give Weapon in Heaven a try.asked and every suggestion He'd ever made.

US	36398642	R14VMKSB16M62E	1592861288	465205597	Desert Sunshine	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Midwest Book Review - a stand out story	Desert Sunshine was an unanticipated gift where reading experiences are concerned.  Reece Daniel tells this story almost tenderly, with a palpable respect for life and earth.<br /><br />Ed Adair is a retired police chief who returns to his boyhood home in Arizona.  Raised on the reservation by his half Apache grandmother, Ed has nursed ill feelings all his life towards his mixed race heritage.  His ice blue eyes earned him the nickname Blue Eyes, a name he considered taunting in childhood and finds derogatory as a man.  It is clear from the outset that Ed may have the looks of a white man, but his spirit is Apache, through and through.<br /><br />When Ed is dry gulched and left near death by a long distance shooter, modern technology can do little to save him.  Ed Adair the modern law officer lays comatose and dying in the present, while the Arizona Territory Ranger known as Blue Eyes wakes up in 1882.<br /><br />Arizona of the 1880s is far different from the one Ed knew in the 21st century.  Primeval White Mountain forests still stand.  Gone are the logged out rutted remnants Ed remembers from the future.  Sweet nature scents blow in on desert winds to stir Ed's native spirit.  Life is simple, full of wonder.  Enemies are not disguised as friends in Arizona's past, and evil presents itself quite clearly.  Men live and die by the gun without reprisal in the Arizona Territory.  Ed fits right in, packing his .45 Colt Peacemaker and a high powered Sharps rifle.  His vision quest as Blue Eyes introduces Ed to his Apache progenitors and ties past to future in unexpected and surrealistic ways.<br /><br />What makes Desert Sunshine work is the tender and poignant way this author crafts his tale.  Yes, the story features a very masculine protagonist and macho action.  Men are men and women are women and both are well aware of the difference in the best John Wayne and Gary Cooper style.  But it is the heart and thoughts of the 1880s Blue Eyes, the half breed Apache finding truth and love that made this book stand out for me.d love that made this book stand out for me.	2003-01-21

The eyes and skill of Marla Franklin, American journalist, give us graphic renderings of Nazi inhumanity.  Cristallnacht.  The Final Solution.  Butchery and deeds too horrible to believe.  In the innocence and vulnerability of piano virtuoso Lady Catherine Rushmore, we see what was perhaps Europe's finest hour.  Courage amidst depravity.  Determination to retain humanity.  Reverence for tradition.  Marla and Catherine become friends and British operatives, trusting in each other while everything around them falls apart.  Each is courted by oddly disparate lovers, without the assurance that these men are not gestapo double agents.<br /><br />The male characters are equally strong.  Christopher Tobin is an Irish patriot turned hard-honed stoic warrior.  His years with the Sinn Fein taught him well to keep his silence and deliver shattering reprisals.  Joachim VanDaren - my personal favorite - is a German nobleman and aryan wunderkind, chiseled perfection in his Nazi SS uniform.  Joachim hides his compassion and sorrow and does what he can to thwart Hitler and his minions.  Ulo Rorvig is a Norsk freedom fighter who knows the true meaning of love and sacrifice.<br /><br />All action and intrigue plays out against the backdrop of a shattered Europe.  Treason and Triumph is a well written and exciting read, and Ms. Toews did a bang up job on research.  If you want to see what WW 2 was really like, complete with glory and dishonor, read this book.	2003-01-19

Mondich.  I can't even imagine the weeks of research that made this premise work so well.<br />David Jenkins is an Air Force Captain, Professor of Physics, and a brilliant scientist.  His gift to the world is holographic memory.  He's chosen by the U.S. government and the Pope to reveal long held secrets of the Shroud of Turin, the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.  David is agnostic, a non-believer, but as pure as any man can be where his work is concerned.  When the lab catches fire during testing, and a Papal representative dies, David makes the perfect scapegoat.  He creates a new life for himself outside the military, as a professor of physics at Rice University.  Always simmering beneath the surface is his anger at a betraying God, a God he flat refuses to believe in.<br />Mondich builds an intriguing tale of greedy politicians and military officers who are not above using anyone - including Jesus Christ - if that will suit their ends.  Simpson Biotech International has supposedly cloned Christ from the Shroud.  The CEO of S.B.I. is David Jenkin's ex Commanding Officer.  Simpson's clone of Christ is dying, and nothing can save him except Jenkin's perfected holographic technology.  Simpson has surrounded himself with a mix of civilian and military bad guys.  Will Professor David Jenkins be a match for them?<br />The climax of this story is explosive, part excitement and part mystery.  Does David Jenkins survive it?  Is Simpson's clone truly Christ come back to earth in human form?  And what is the amazing phenomenon called The Crystalline Rain?  I suggest you read the book to find out.	2003-01-10
US	36398642	R9HZE6XZW3KPU	1591292948	941237423	In Him, I Am Able	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Midwest Book Review - a beautiful and fitting legacy	Let me preface this review by saying that I personally knew Mellie Smith.  I knew Mellie the woman and mission worker, the church secretary and fun-lover.  Mellie the Christian, wife, mother, and grandmother was my friend.  The author died before this book was published.  And I, along with every other human being who had benefitted from her joy, wished that God had let her live.  But Mellie wanted to be with the Lord.  That was our only comfort at the time, and then her book came out.  A family-written addendum detailing Mellie's last few weeks of life had not yet been added into my review copy, but was a powerful epilogue.<br /><br />\\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\\"  That quote from Phillippians was Mellie's mantra and set the tone for everything she did.  It's all here in this book.  When Mellie was in Africa, braving human cruelty and killer bees, Christ was with her clearing out the way.  And when evil personified threatened her in Haiti, her Savior was riding shotgun.  Humanity took on a finer meaning when Mellie shared her love in prisons, because she hated sin but loved the sinner, just as Jesus wants us all to do.  Every place she went, everything she did, Mellie Smith took Jesus with her.  She spread her love and His around to make our sometimes dreary world a little brighter.<br /><br />This book is only one small part of Mellie's legacy.  What she was and all she did for Christ and others remains as a testimony to her boundless faith.  In Him I Am Able shares the author's zest for life, her strongly held beliefs.  Her words are full of hope, the writing eloquent.  Mellie Smith is still a bright example of what humans ought to be, sharing humor and a healthy shot of courage from beyond the pale.	2003-01-10

I know first hand about the South and Southern women.  I'd say she caught the nuances just right.<br /><br />Cherokee England - Ricki to her friends - is divorced from a husband she still loves and searching for some meaning in her life.  Ricki and Danny England were high school sweethearts, married young, and produced a son who's reached the age of 17.  How the fire that always flared between them died out, Ricki hasn't figured out.  She still misses Danny, but he has a new woman in his life and is planning a second marriage.  Ricki tries to face her life with humor and courage, but it isn't always easy.<br /><br />Activities with Women Aware and Responsive (WAR) fill the void.  She and her fellow vigilantes step in when public WAR activities fail.  That Ricki keeps herself in hot water with these covert activities is an understatement.  Danny is a politician who aspires to climb the ladder of success.  Ricki's dabbling in slightly illegal vigilanteism brings his fiery temper to a boil, and introduces her to a sexy, charming detective with the Knoxville Police Department.  Sam.  Both literally and figuratively, with Sam, Ricki adds a notch to her bedpost.  She figures, if Danny can play around then I can too.  Sam isn't the last notch she adds to her bedpost either.  As Ricki fights injustice on all fronts with WAR, and experiments with expanding her sexual experience, she reclaims Danny's favors and attention.<br /><br />Chasing Horses is a lesson Ricki learns at last:  The best way to catch a horse is not to chase him.  Ms. French's novel is a mix of dark truths and humor, romance and thriller, with a little dash of pathos.  I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This book is for mature readers due to spicy sexual content.	2002-12-11

It's a very good book.  The writing style is crisp, the story fast moving, and the characters integrated nicely with the plot.  Norm Harris details the convoluted machinations of world powers and their minions with panache.<br /><br />Faydra Green, a Navy lawyer, also happens to be the daughter of ex-president Green.  Her entire life has been spent attempting to succeed on her own merit.  When a Navy SEAL is found murdered, Faydra is hand picked my her superiors to investigate.  It isn't long before the savvy Faydra concludes the arrested murder suspect is not the killer.<br /><br />From that beginning investigation, Faydra is drawn ever deeper into a world of CIA and NSA spooks, specially trained hit men and trouble shooters, and the inner workings of more than one world power.  The USA and Russia, complete with top secret weaponry, are taken to the very brink of all-out war with North Korea.<br /><br />The author has created a fascinating mix of characters to protect and aid Faydra's investigation.  The E-Team is a group of specially trained young warriors, answerable only to the President and a small handful of military officers.  Everything about this group is classified, including their real names.  Navy captain Egan Fletcher is no stranger to action himself.  He accompanies the E-team  in their quest to save the world from a biohazard holocaust.  All characters play a part, and play it well.<br /><br />Military enthusiasts should love this book, as should those who crave fast paced mystery thrillers.  Norm Harris has a winner here, with action packed movie written all over it.	2002-12-09

And those who still struggle with the happenings of 9-11 may just find healing within these pages.  Regardless of the reason, those who grieve will find Ms. Russell's book to be packed with wisdom and comfort.<br /><br />It's obvious from page one that the author did not write this book off the top of her head.  The subject is not presented lightly.  Ms. Russell did her homework, her research.  I found the content to be presented succinctly, in a personable and soothing writing style.  The author does not present a blanket &quot;solve-all&quot; approach to grief and loss but does provide the tools necessary to take that first step through the maze and confusion.<br /><br />As a reader who has experienced all phases of grief and loss first hand - both as a Registered Nurse and a fellow human being - I was impressed by the content of this book.  The author gently and lovingly guides her readers along a sometimes thorny path providing fresh perspectives.  I recommend this book to anyone who may be struggling with grief and loss of any kind.	2002-12-02

The Wyoming Territory of 1876 is a vast expanse of land, and the people living there are cut from a rugged cloth.  Nature, native Indians both good and bad, and the land itself all figure prominently in this tale, but what really makes Once and Again work is the characters.<br /><br />Lance McCoy is the prodigal son returned after ten years' absence.  At age twenty-six, memories of his abusive, alcoholic father still rankle.  The return home after his father's death is bitter tinged.  In his mind, he's still the outcast son of the local drunken womanizer.  That his father nearly drank and gambled away his mother's cattle ranch adds further reluctance to his  homecoming.  Lance hopes for a swift return to New Orleans and his successful life there, but feels an obligation to help his mother Charlotte save her birthright.  He carries with him a lock of auburn hair, a pocket knife, and near forgotten memories of a girl he once adored.<br /><br />Jenny Sterling is the hard working daughter of a wealthy and successful cattle rancher.  Since Jack Sterling's stroke a year before, Jenny has taken on more responsibility than any young woman of means should have to bear.  Despite her father's standing in the territory, Jenny is an outast herself.  Nine years earlier, she bore a daughter out of wedlock.  Only pride, courage, love of her daughter, and her father's support keep Jenny going.  Lance McCoy's return brings back old memories, ones she tries to smother down.<br /><br />The reader guesses straight off who fathered Jenny's child.  Old feelings simmer just below the surface with Lance's daily presence in Jenny's life.  That desires thought long forgotten erupt into mature passion is inevitable.  Lance is no longer an abused and introverted boy.  He's a man of the world who knows what he wants, and he wants Jenny.  She's proud, headstrong, more beautiful than any woman Lance has ever known, and afraid of being hurt by love again.

It was indeed that, and much more.  Larry Bohall's carefully controlled style is vibrant, tender, with a touch of humor.  This book is mysterious, haunting, humorous, and ultimately touching.<br /><br />John Wesley Hunter is a Bishop in the United Methodist Church.  Despite that status, he's a very human hero.  Women find his height and looks appealing, but he sees himself in quite a different light.  He's insecure about his bony legs, and thinks perhaps he's not as manly as he should be, in any way.  Despite his many accomplishments, Bishop Hunter has good reason to feel less than successful where women are concerned.  He's nursed a broken heart for almost 20 years because the beautiful and enchanting Heather, the light of his life, chose another man in place of him.<br /><br />When Hunter's dog Samson awakens him in the middle of the night. he's greeted by a faint, familiar scent at first, and then the sight of Heather dancing in his office.

The Bishop and his spirit-sweetheart pick up where they left off, meshing as a team  Mr. Bohall makes this premise work effectively, with skill.  I found myself straining to assist in solving the mystery before the bad guys killed another victim.  And I hoped the ghostly Heather could ease the Bishop's pain and heal his broken heart.<br /><br />Hunter's investigation produces threats, intimidation, beatings, and an attempt on his life in close succession.  The quiet, gentle Bishop with a wry sense of humor turns volatile, gains strength as he seeks out Heather's killer.<br />Before the last page, rest assured that all loose ends will be tied up and Hunter's heart will be nicely mended.<br /><br />Yes, this was a romantic mystery.

The characters are believable and carry this story along swiftly with gritty realism.  That the reader suspects from the beginning who the murderer might be does not dilute the suspense.<br /><br />Jackson Daniels - Jack to his friends - is a lonely police detective whose empty life has worn him down.  When a serial killer stalks successful lawyers in Knoxville, there are few clues to help Jack and his partner Marvin break the case.  Each crime scene they encounter is awash with the sight and scent of blood, every victim has been mutilated.  And above each death bed the murderer has scrawled, \\"Wayne's Dead\\".  Every facet of their investigation leads to a dead end.<br /><br />Jack meets and is immediately attracted to the beautiful and childlike Gillian.<br />Starkly sexual one minute and innocent enough to break Jack's heart the next, her changeability keeps him off center and bemused.  All Jack knows is that he can't remember loving or being loved so thoroughly in the past, and can't imagine life without her.<br /><br />The author interweaves Jack's love story with a serial killer's handiwork in ways that make Wayne's Dead a fast and fascinating read.  This is not a story for children or sensitive adults due to realistic dialog, violent scenarios, and mature themes.  But those who enjoy adult thrillers will find it worth their while.	2002-11-16

They never left her heart.<br /><br />Ms. VanLydegraf most assuredly had a lot of love to give if only life had turned in her favor.  But both &quot;princes&quot; she loved and dreamed about as husbands turned out not to be so charming.  It was the early 1960's when her youth and naievete got in the way of better judgement.  The era of flower power and free love, in her case, was anything but free.  She found herself young, pregnant, abandoned, and short on options in those days.  What support her parents might have offered was limited by debilitating disease.<br /><br />In this true story, the author bluntly and honestly details the tragedy of unmarried pregnancy and the adoption process, what leads up to it as well as what haunts all parties afterwards for decades.  The reunion with both adopted out sons is joyous, but remains bittersweet around the edges.  Her heart and spirit were changed by life experience.  She will never be the same, despite establishing relationships with both the sons she gave up in her teens.  That is the poignant message delivered in Notes From Nobody.  Mother Love cannot always conquer all, but it keeps trying no matter what.	2002-11-10

She took an unlikely premise - a departed woman's spirit caught in Limbo - and created a beautiful story.  Written in the first person, from the bewildered spirit-woman's perspective, Ms. Lindsay had me hooked from the first line of the first paragraph.<br /><br />Kate is a fiftyish woman who dies after a long and dreadful illness.  At her side when death comes is her flamboyant best friend, Veronica, and her coldly stoic husband, William.  Absent from her life is Celia, a daughter who abandoned her parents' sham marriage eight years prior.  Kate is definitely dead, but lingers in ghostly form to witness the lives and read the thoughts of those who loved her, as well as those who didn't.<br /><br />William and Kate shared an almost totally loveless marriage for thirty years.  William hasn't looked at her, REALLY looked at her as a woman, since the early years of life together.  Except for a too-brief period of infidelity with the younger Milo, who adored her, Kate's life has been bereft of joy.<br /><br />With the aid and guidance of her guardian angel, Thomas, Kate hovers in and about the lives of her husband, friend, daughter Celia, and grandson Matt.  Over time, Kate begins to understand that before she can progress to what Thomas assures her is a wonderful new place, she must address the awful mess that was her life on earth.  Kate works at tying up loose ends, gaining wisdom and insight into the lives of those closest to her.  An amazing end is wrought, with William, Milo, Celia and Kate drawn together in their struggle to save a dying Matt.<br /><br />The beauty and wonder of Diving Through Clouds is experienced in the author's writing.  I found myself awed by and envying her skill as wordsmith.  From Kate's self-deprecating humor, her sorrow and anger at revealed secrets, to descriptive passages that help the reader see and feel each scene, Ms. Lindsay's prose is pure, revelatory.<br /><br />This is a book for adults and mature adolescents.

F.E. Mazur chose a disturbing subject for his first novel, one that caught and held me to the very last page.  As a one-time educator, he seems to write from harsh experience.  Who fares better in the current education system, teachers with a spine who hope to make a difference, or those who coast through their days untouched by the chaos around them?<br /><br />Grayson Lord is the main character of Spine.  He's young, attractive, quietly cynical about the school system and quality of learning offered.  Gray lives alone, interacts socially on a somewhat superficial level out of choice, and does his best to make English and Literature attractive to his students.  With few exceptions, neither his students nor the school administration appreciate Gray's efforts<br /><br />Gray treasures books and the written word, enjoys a well-crafted joke and drinks with fellow teachers after work.  The new school year promises to be like every other, more of the same, until the Aftanas clan moves into the school district.  Always the controlled and reasonable teacher-figure, Gray is at first perturbed and then provoked by the horrible behavior of Asa Aftanas.  Asa and his equally brutal father share a dark secret from the past, and nothing Grayson Lord ever read or imagined could prepare him for their kind.<br /><br />There are those who will label Spine a mystery-suspense novel.  I consider it mainstream fiction.  The teachers, students, administrators, school board members, and parents were realistically portrayed.  The language and content were often harsh and profane, much as it is in real life.  The futility of teaching those who prefer not to be taught was troubling, but true.  The attempted character assassination of a once idealistic man was painful to experience from Gray's perspective.  And the murderous Aftanas family was frightening to contemplate.<br /><br />The subject matter of Spine was not pretty, but Mr. Mazur's writing style made the read worthwhile.  This is not a book for children, sensitive adults, or those who like escapist reading.  The story posed questions and scenarios that didn't have pat answers.  That's why I liked it.ter of Spine was not pretty, but Mr. Mazur's writing style made the read worthwhile.  This is not a book for children, sensitive adults, or those who like escapist reading.

US	36398642	RR42KCF7BV99E	1591298148	387231093	Death by Bad Magic	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Midwest Book Review - good battles evil in Louisiana bayou	In her second novel, Death by Bad Magic, Violet Towe takes the modern world as we know it and transports us to a place where voodoo reigns.  Don't expect the hokey sort of voodoo we've all seen in movies.  I'm talking REAL voodoo, as it was practiced in the days of ancient Africa.<br />Sarah Benifield is a twice-married mother of two without so much as a parking ticket when suddenly she finds herself in jail for murder.  Sarah's boss is dead, and she's the prime suspect,  with two grown children living in another state, an ex-husband who ignores her, and a current husband who coldly turns his back when she's arrested.  If not for a sympathetic and supportive lawyer - the best her money can retain - Sarah would be totally alone.<br />Sarah hires an old friend and private investigator to explore her boss's roots in Louisiana.  He calls to say he's found proof that Sarah's boss was murdered, and that Sarah's life is in grave danger.  When the judge grants her request to travel out of state, a skeptical Sarah is introduced to voodoo in its highest form.  Priest Herbie is a kindly, compassionate master of vodun - good magic.  He fears for Sarah and knows her boss was caused to die by an evil bokor - death by bad magic.  Vodun serves a good and powerful God, the same God Sarah knows.  When Sarah is kidnapped by the evil bokor, Priest Herbie and his followers set out to find her.  Accompanied by an odd mix of law officers from Georgia and Louisiana and Sarah's devoted P.I., the powerful priest does battle for her life and spirit.  Sarah has been injected with a zombie drug and Herbie is the only one who knows the cure.  Deep in the swamps of Louisiana, Priest Herbie and his vodun followers combat evil with good.  Sarah is saved.  She and every person present are dramatically changed by what they see and experience in the swamp.  But that is not the end of it.  The Evil Bokor is not done with Sarah, her friends, or Herbie and his family.<br />I must confess to reading this book straight through.  I devoured it, actually.  The world of good magic came alive through Ms. Towe's prose.  I learned the truth about zombies, the voodoo spirit world and the good God they serve, and how hexed animals are forced to fight on the side of evil.<br />Make no mistake.  Whether it be a powerful vodun priest serving his Bon Dieu, or a devoted Christian serving a beneficent God, our world is torn by good and evil.  The author handles this premise well, in an exciting story.  I liked the book, and learned a thing or two while reading it.<br /><br />.book straight through.  I devoured it, actually.

He's learned a thing or two since writing his first book, and has put it all to good use in Strike Swiftly.<br />Hans Reinhardt and his Hitler Youth sidekick Heinrich are still very much in evidence. Hans is in his 80s, but no doddering old man by any stretch of the imagination. He is \\"soft spoken with full bodied white hair, still well-muscled despite advanced age, with bright blue eyes that stalk their way from under white eyebrows\\". Despite that kindly description of the evil genius, Hans, his plan in this book is sinister and horrifying. He's plotted his revenge on Tony Wilson for several years and everything is firmly underway as this book begins. Age and an obsessive hatred of our hero has warped Hans' mind to a frightening degree. Neither his loyalty to the Nazi party nor his friendships of a lifetime mean much anymore compared to his drive to punish Tony Wilson. This time nothing is left to chance. Tony's demise is planned around detonating an SS-20 Ballistic Missile Warhead packing a 50 megaton whallop.<br />Tony is now an F.B.I. agent, but tragedy has given him a harder edge this time around. The calm and methodical Tony of Strike Hard has turned reckless, with a coldly cynical streak he didn't have before. Tony doesn't much give a damn if he lives or dies, long before Hans resurfaces. His old friend, Nathan Hooks, joins the fray once again as Tony battles wits with Hans in a hair raising countdown to nuclear calamity. His cat and mouse game with Hans holds special meaning, because the personal stakes involved are broader reaching. This time, if Hans has his way, Tony will die along with everyone he loves and tens of thousands more.<br />Just like with his first book, Kevin Grover did his research, producing fascinating tidbits gleaned directly from the Los Alamos National Laboratory staff. And the author threw in a couple unexpected twists that caught me totally off guard.<br />Strike Swiftly is well written. The tension builds to a thought provoking climax, and the ending gave me chills. Mr. Grover has me eagerly anticipating a third book in this series!is well written.

To say this book is a keeper doesn't begin to cover it.  Pat Johnston writes in first person and does it in a superbly masculine style, with gusto.  Everything is documented so realistically, I had trouble believing it was fiction.<br /><br />Jake Rickmeyer flees a drunken, abusive step-father and joins the Navy in 1944 at age 16.  The Navy is an ideal home for Jake.  He loves the sea and everything it stands for, including the ideals of serving home and country.  His career spans World War Two, Korea, the Cuban missile crisis, two tours in Viet Nam, and Black Ops for the CIA.  The reader sees each action through Jake's eyes as he serves aboard destroyers, cruisers, amphibious ships, and anything else the Navy throws at him.  Jake is the best of the best in everything he does, from rigging for a stormy ocean to piloting through murky Vietnamese rivers, to pleasing females every chance he gets in foreign ports.  Along the way he makes some influential friends who give him a leg up in rank.  Such boosts are always more than earned.<br /><br />Life aboard ship is described lovingly: \\"...the cooks baking tomorrow's bread, the comforting smell of cigarette smoke and coffee...the smell of men, machinery, fuel oil, grease and paint in every pore of her.\\"  Jake's women, also, add to his persona.  A failed marriage that gets a second chance in later life, unrequited love,[unhappy-motivated]foreign women all help define Jake as a man, a patriot, a warrior, an often decorated man of courage, a typical American male giving his best and grieving the death of friends in battle.  Jake has no political agenda, no deep hidden philosophy except to be a man and gut it out no matter what.  He takes in stride rescuing fallen flyers in frigid oceans, covering night landings on enemy held beaches, and gunning after kamikaze planes that fill the sky like wasps.<br /><br />Be prepared to wave the American flag in spirit as you read this rouser of a book.  Pat Johnston's writing is powerful, visceral, as he communicates duty and honor.  And don't be surprised at the chilling end to Boatswain's Mate.  Somehow I doubt that Jake Rickmeyer was.  This book is for mature adults, not children or young adolescents.  I recommend it.sky like wasps.<BR> <BR>Be prepared to wave the American flag in spirit as you read this rouser of a book.

Romantic and frightening, intriguing and violent in turn, the author weaves a mystery of lost love and a vicious serial killer's madness.<br /><br />Sean Jamison is a loner, a dinosaur, a decidedly unmodern male.  His profession as police detective in the Houston Metro area has burnt him out in every way a man can be.  Deliberately celibate and achingly lonely, Det. Jamison has waited all his adult life to find the one woman he can ever truly love.  He's beginning to fear that no woman would want the ragged burned out gumshoe he's become.  Still, he hopes for a woman of substance.  His tortured mind imagines having the kind of love he witnessed between his parents.  Sean dreams of unconditional love, of loyalty and commitment with no doubts,  He desires a one man woman, one that will be soul mate, lover, companion, and anchor.  If that woman ever materializes, Sean is prepared to be that much to her and more.<br /><br />A cunningly evil serial killer is stalking the women of Houston.  His cryptic statement to each victim after death and before taking a lock of their hair is, \\"Yet each man kills the thing he loves...\\"  Det. Jamison and his co-workers scramble in their efforts to get into the perpetrator's brain before he kills again.  Sean's efforts are almost derailed when unexpected buried memories resurface.<br /><br />One morning on his way to work, the sight of a refinery's huge smokestacks belching smoke nearly incapacitates Sean.  He feels as if he has spontaneously combusted just before unconsciousness sets in.  Suddenly, he knows who he was in a past life, remembers how he died in Nazi-infested Europe, and knows the lover he's been searching for.  And then he spies a tattered double breasted coat at an outdoor flea market.  HIS coat, the coat his sweetheart died in.  The search begins for his lost lover, a search that crosses paths with the serial killer who stole that first love from him.<br /><br />In this haunting tale of murder, reincarnation, and timeless love, Stephen Sulik resurrects the characters from a previous book, Random Ransom.  I plan to read that previous book in hopes of learning more about Det. Roman Addison and Capt. Virginia Schaffer.  All characters are well developed and the dialogue is realistic.  Gritty everyday scenes that greet policemen on the job are believable and harsh.  But it is with the reincarnated lover, the desperately lonely Sean Jamison, that Mr. Sulik shines.  Romance readers as well as action thriller fans should find The Tattered Coat pleasing fare.

US	36398642	RBILMM8CDV4AE	1588518787	247055643	Pregnant and Blown Off	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Midwest Book Review - pragmatic, well written, informative	What options are available to a woman who gets pregnant by a man whose first suggestion on hearing the news is to &quot;get an abortion&quot;?  And if her love for him far surpasses anything he ever felt for her, what then?  The author's prose is pragmatic, sometimes painful, often humorous, and always sensible.  She writes in a no-nonsense style, taking each dilemma head on from the viewpoint of practicing physician and woman.<br /><br />What kind of man would dally with a woman, speak love words with a lying tongue, then dump her when she has his baby growing in her?  What sort of man would want his progeny aborted to make life simpler, at least for him?  What type of man would turn his back and walk away without a backward glance or thought for mother or fetus?  From her knowledge of human frailties, Ms. Schmidt documents in straightforward language and style the types of men who work such anguish on unsuspecting women.  This reader understood the message clearly:  Any man who lies to get his way in bed, and then abandons a baby he created - not to mention the woman who trusted him - is no kind of man at all.  The author laid that message on the line without mincing words.  Such men are cowards, pure and simple, and their women are better off without them.<br /><br />Having babies and struggling to raise them is difficult without a loving and supportive father in the picture.  Most single mothers work hard at a full time job to feed and raise their child alone.  Even those fortunate enough to get child support from the father have their trials.  With child support comes demands from a usually spoiled, childish, unpredictable and unreliable man.<br /><br />Ms. Schmidt covers all the bases in this honest chronicle of fatherless children and husbandless women.  Her advice is always practical, and often poignant.  She writes of pregnancy, newborns, toddlers, and school age children with a knowledge that comes only with experience.  Her advice on fielding common everyday problems is a primer every woman faced with single motherhood should read.<br /><br />I liked the author's forthright way of stating facts and presenting information.  But this book is not a how-to manual, although it easily could be and maybe should be, for women who see abortion as a non-option.  Pregnant and Blown off is much more than that.  It's a personal account, written from the heart of a woman whose belief in God and herself reversed a horrid situation through sheer faith and courage.lems is a primer every woman faced with single motherhood should read.<BR> <BR>I liked the author's forthright way of stating facts and presenting information.

But that was not the first time Americans have been attacked.  Pre-dating 9/11 by several years was was a cowardly attack on patriots, housed on what they thought was friendly soil.  In 1996, American servicemen died in Khobar Towers, Dharan, Saudi Arabia.  And many of those who lived are still fighting battles to reclaim lives so swiftly snatched away.  P.E. Blais writes of one such survivor, his only son, Paul.<br /><br />I had to read this book twice, over a long period of time.  The author is so skilled, and writes with such searing realism, that I could not bear to read it all at once.  Perhaps I'm just a pansy, or maybe those horrifying scenes of 9/11 were still too fresh in my mind.  Resurrecting Paul might not have borne such impact if written by a lesser writer, but Mr. Blais is anything but mediocre.  His pain and denial, his raging at this unkind fate that killed so many young men and almost took his son was burned indelibly into every page.<br /><br />Resurrection does not come easily or soon.  Young Paul's dreams are shattered, and at first no one believes he can survive, let alone overcome the obstacles he faces.  Each hard won accomplishment is documented in vivid detail.  His responses to physical and mental failings no young man should have to face are intensely personal and documented honestly by his father.<br /><br />Surrounded by loyal friends and supportive family, Paul fights, fears, lashes out, falls, crawls, and stumbles his way to some semblance of his former life.  He has written his own book about the incident in Dharan and the aftermath.  I have not read Tragedy to Triumph, but if his work is anywhere near the calibre of his father's, it will be well worth reading.<br /><br />I enthusiastically recommend Resurrecting Paul to those who appreciate good writing and emotions that draw the reader in.  As far as I'm concerned, this book falls under the category of must have must read.falls under the category of must have must read.	2002-09-07

Heart pounding action.<br />Mind blowing battles.  Adrenalin pumping encounters with alien life.  Mr. Thomas packs that and more into this futuristic sci fi masterpiece.<br /><br />From first page to last, the action stopped just long enough to let me catch my breath.  The story unfolds through the eyes of Thinker, a Legion warrior who joined up after a broken romance.  Thinker and his fellow warriors are kept young and strong, immortal, through biotechnology beyond our present imagination.  The barren worlds they face and alien life they battle become real through the author's creative mind and skillful writing style.<br /><br />Horrific other-worldly combat assignments come alive through Mr. Thomas's prose.  Eerie images of fire and destruction dance on the face plates of their armor as our heroic warriors slog their way through blood, fire, slime, and body parts to hard-won victories.  From fossilized cities that once housed vanished civilizations, to violent volcanic worlds, Thinker and his Beta unit take on forces that are bent on destroying life.  All human life.  These immortal warriors face horror and human degradation beyond imagination.  But ruthless slavers and hives of terrifying alien maneaters barely prepare them for the scourge of all creation, the soulless Omnis.<br /><br />Times of respite are few and far between for soldiers of the Legion.  Thinker has the violently possessive Valkyrie and tender-hearted Priestess to take his mind off warring.  Except for those rare occasions, Thinkers mind is seldom far from thoughts of battles, past and future.  It's the way of the Legion.<br /><br />At the end of Soldier of the Legion, the author sets us up for what will no doubt be an equally exciting sequel.  If what follows is as good as his first, Marshall Thomas should soon be a major name in futuristic sci fi.  I enthusiastically recommend this book to fans of the genre as well as those who simply enjoy excellent story telling.ly exciting sequel.

Landlocked Sailors not only has murder, action and suspense, but appealing prose describing the Erie PA locales.  And it's all tied up into a neat package with quirky characters, realistic dialog, and humor.<br /><br />Thomas Teague is one of the main characters, ex-special agent in the U.S. Naval Investigative Service looking for a quiet place to light.  Teague is a wounded warrior, stoically bearing the aftermath of injuries that forced his retirement.  All he wants is to charter out his boat to tourist types, admire Beth Osgood from a safe distance, and be left the hell alone.  Teague enjoys quiet thoughts about his hero-father's days in WW II and listening to Glenn Miller music.  He leads a purposely solitary life in hopes his past won't find him.<br /><br />Jack Crevalle is the exact opposite of Teague.  Crevalle has a heroic background of his own in the Coast Guard, but hides such courage well beneath a devil-may-care facade.  Jack lives on his boat, playing loud music that grates on Teague's nerves,  raucously enjoying one night stands that keep his boat rocking in its slip at Pike's Marina.  Jack drinks too much, happily flaunts his appetite for females, and talks too loud.  Still, there's something likable about the guy.<br /><br />Beth Osgood's father owns Pike's Marina.  Recently divorced, she's come back home to Erie to reclaim the safe and stable kind of life she's always known.  Crevalle's crass ways turn her off completely, but she's more than just a bit intrigued by the quiet, world-worn Thomas Teague.  Beth is a knockout - smart, feminine, athletic, self-assured - but fits into the odd group of folks at Pike's Marina like she's just one of the boys.<br /><br />When the sweet natured, self-appointed security guard for Pike's Marina is bludgeoned to death for no apparent, this group and their friends set out to find answers.  Everyone loved the murdered Liam, especially Beth and Teague.  Who could possibly have reason to snuff out an innocent like Liam?<br /><br />Finding the murderer won't be an easy task.  The Great Lakes Sails Festival begins the same day as the murder and Erie is packed with tourists and sailors from around the world.  Teague has a hunch that his past has returned to haunt him.  He's soon proven right when an old nemesis shows himself.  No one is safe from Russell Zurkis, whose history of insanity and murderous inclinations have joined forces to eliminate Thomas Teague and anyone he cares about.  The gang will have to go some to escape the crazy Russell's wrath.<br /><br />I give this book a hearty recommendation, for all the aforementioned reasons and more.  Mr. Bednar has a fine beginning here, and I eagerly anticipate the second in his Pike's Marina Series.  Look for a review of that second book to follow this one.  Count your lucky stars, readers, because both Landlocked Sailors and Fish or Cut Bait have been released as of this writing.ryone loved the murdered Liam, especially Beth and Teague.

He reprised the characters from Landlocked Sailors, much to my delight, and added a few new wrinkles to keep his readers hooked.  And like his first book, the author's writing style is crisp and stylish.<br /><br />Fish or Cut Bait begins a year from where Landlocked Sailors left off.  Thomas Teague is back, still admiring Beth Osgood from a safe distance.  Detachment from desire is more difficult this time around since Beth is now the first mate on his fishing boat, The Ancient Mariner.  Beth has made Teague her main goal in life and makes it clear, in thought if not in actions, that one way or another she will hook her silent friend.  Their rakehell pal, Jack Crevalle, is still wearing oddly decorated boxers everywhere he goes and bedding brunettes on his boat, the Seadawg.  Teague's father - the aging, crafty WW 2 hero - has now joined ranks and is part owner of Pike's Marina.  It's a draw as to which Pike's owner is the most curmudgeonly and canny - Teague's father or Beth's.  All in all, they make a fine mix of characters that play off each other realistically.  The Erie PA locales are described so realistically that I could see, feel, and smell the fog and air blown in across the lake.<br /><br />This book begins with mysterious happenings on Lake Erie.  On a fog enshrouded day, a boat is lost and finally towed in by the Coast Guard, minus passengers.  Jack Crevalle is troubled by the situation  As the Pike's Marina friends look on, hoping for word of survivors, Gina Cachinni appears to them from the fog and sends Jack's carefree life into a tailspin.  Gina is the original brunette, Jack's first and only serious love, the one who broke their engagement to marry another, much richer man.  To Jack, Gina represents a crack in time, a crack in his soul, a loss from which he never quite recovered.<br /><br />All passengers aboard the foundered boat, the C-Dog, are lost and turn up dead not long after.  Thomas and Ray Teague's suspicious military minds kick in at the obvious similarity between C-Dog and SeaDawg and the thought occurs that Jack may have been the target.  Thomas, in particular, fears Gina may not be the sweet devoted long lost lover she pretends.<br /><br />Gina quickly resumes her old relationship with an unusually reluctant Jack, while flirting with every male around, much to Beth's dismay.  The petite and pretty Gina has big plans for Thomas Teague.  She'll need accomplished heroes like Thomas and her ever-reliable Jack when the murderous Marvin Gardens aka Biggie Big comes in search of her!  Her checquered past is rapidly zeroing in on Pike's Marina, and she knows it.<br /><br />It's a heart pounder, with Thomas calling in old favors from his military contacts, and coming up against a killer twice his size.  Jack also takes part in the battle, in his own inimitable style, as the friends from Pike's Marina work together to survive this latest plot to do them in.<br /><br />Fish or Cut Bait is a great read, as was its predecessor.  Dave Bednar's novels have realistic, wry and witty dialog, sometimes prickly humor, and characters who bring the story home in spades.  I hope to see a third in this Pike's Marina series soon.

You are first introduced to him and his colleagues; Henderson, Hal, Rory and Thom as they are investigating a murder case. Detective O'Brien immediately reminded me of the Detectives of long lost famous television shows, like Jack Web from \\"Dragnet.\\" This certainly was not a bad thing for this reviewer, but rather made for a `trip down memory lane' read. One I enjoyed.<br />It is a laid back novel, not fast paced, despite the entire core of it being centered around murder investigations. This is not to say that there was not mystery in this novel, for indeed there was, as Detective O'Brien and his team are faced with a killer who has a cruel sadistic side.<br />Detective O'Brien tells the stories, from his eyes. After the first murder is solved, the rest of the book brings you into O'Brien's investigation of a crime of mutilated bodies, seemingly of homeless people. Just what were those strange markings on the bodies of the victims? And why was their blood drained out? The author does a good job of bringing you into the swing of the story, but I feel he could be a little more descriptive of characters, surroundings and emotions.<br />I liked the way Mr. Seifrit brought the murderer into the story and the reason why this person killed. I found it intriguing, and I also liked the way he threw in a few other suspects, allowing you to play detective for a while. This book grows on you! I think those who like a good detective novel will enjoy this one. Looking forward to book 2!	2002-08-06
US	36398642	R3UPAO9RJGST7R	1588515893	179786606	Sisters Forever	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Midwest Book Review - poignant, beautiful story	Sharon D. Martin begins this poignant tale in 1822 South Carolina.  It's the Old South, that antebellum era of plantations and parties, southern belles and courtly gentlemen, free men and slaves.  Into this world of privilege, April Marie Cothran is born to wealthy plantation-owner parents.  April is born breech, a difficult and traumatic birth.  She is the only child her mother will ever bear.<br /><br />One month later, a 13 year old Cothran slave named Lilly gives birth to a girl child sired by a Mandingo warrior.  April's mother names the newborn slave May.  Lilly, little more than a child herself, is taken into the master's house as wetnurse for April.  Thus begins this story of two lives that remain entwined together for a lifetime.<br /><br />April and May - one the white child of privilege, the other a result of mating slaves like prize animals - are raised as siblings.  These two children of diverse backgrounds are oblivious to color barriers and taboos of the time.<br />Southern race and class issues mean nothing to them.  In their minds, they're sisters.  Sisters forever.<br /><br />Ms. Martin masterfully intertwines the lives of April and May through ensuing decades.  Through marriage, births, joys, deaths, sorrows, the Civil War and its aftermath, the author shows us the lives of these two women.  Along the way we witness human cruelty and courage, hatred and forgiveness , the blessings of unconditional love, and the surprise of reward and resurrection.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story, written with honesty and compassion, about a time in our history that was not always pretty for either race.  The surprise ending lays the groundwork for a sequel to Sisters Forever.  Readers should prepare themselves for more southern history, and another well told story by Ms. Martin.	2002-07-15

I hide under a calm mask,<br />Smiling to the faces of onlookers,<br />Dying when they turn away.<br />With those words, Rebekah Hurth reveals the depth of her despair in this book of poems borne of tragedy.<br />Some years back, Rebekah's family was dragged through the public arena in the aftermath of a crime. An outraged public at the time was not kind. Through poetry, the author struggled to make sense out of a chaotic world through a child's eyes. Particularly heart breaking is this excerpt that clearly demonstrates her confusion, her crying out to an absent father.<br />Daddy?<br />Do you hear me where you are?<br />Can you feel how much I miss you?<br />Do you know how much I love you?<br />Daddy.<br />Do you see how much I need you?<br />With no one here to fight for me,<br />Or help me to be strong.<br />Through this time of harsh publicity that the author and her family could not escape, Rebekah Hurth attempted to stay firmly in God's hands, to hold onto faith. The reader, through the author's words, fully comprehends the mixed emotions she experiences.<br />Deep down anger sits,<br />Stirring and growing,<br />Reaching from the pit I've thrown it in.<br />I continue holding it inside,<br />While trying to forget.<br />Ms. Hurth's poems are sweet, sad, heart stirring. I hope she spreads her wings and gives us future books of poetry, and perhaps even prose.	2002-07-12

I've heard it said that as long as the public has \\"theirs\\" - meaning the good life - they don't care how down, dirty, and lethal politics is played in our nation's capitol.  In this fictional account of how money rules our government, the public doesn't get enough truthful information out of D.C. to make that decision either way.  In $oft Money, power begats power, money begats more money, and only a privileged few rake in the bounty.  And the American taxpayers, who closed their eyes while career politicians took over, are reaping the bitter harvest.<br /><br />E.L. Burton has created a fast-paced thriller that entertains and intrigues.  I couldn't put it down.  It's packed from start to end with avaricious power hungry villains, the hapless folks they victimize, and idealistic men who take an honest stand.  His characters are well-developed and defined.<br /><br />Clay Danvers is the smooth talking, good looking spin doctor who serves a popular President.  Clay considers himself to be a skilled, well-paid assassin.  No, he doesn't actually KILL people, but he brings about their downfall until they might as well be dead.  Whatever scruples Clay once had are long since buried by his crimes.<br /><br />Preston Wesley is the people-friendly, charismatic President of the United States.  A covert group of wealthy, powerful, and ruthless men stay busy day and night maintaining Pres. Wesley's front and ensuring all skeletons of the past stay hidden.<br /><br />The undisputed leader of the covert group is Mike Baker, President and CEO of Bytes Technology.  Mike is a billionaire many times over from his computer software business, but even billions are not enough to sooth his greed for more money and increasing power.  Mike is vicious, a puppet master with a passion to control the President and all he stands for.<br /><br />Lawrence Brazelton is one of the unfortunates the group has sacrificed in protection of the President.  He's lost everything dear to him,  but isn't quite the broken man he seems.  He has the hope of loving for a second time and finding life outside the Beltway, if he can just live long enough to make it happen.  Lawrence has a covert op of his own underway, and neither the President nor his cohorts will like it much.  Paybacks will be hell if Lawrence Brazelton has his way.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to see the bad guys taken down in this one, and held my breath in hopes that at least one good guy survived to make it happen.  Mr. Burton does a fine job of holding the reader's interest, and introduces subjects that will keep you pondering after the book ends.  For certain, I will never use a cell phone, telephone, or connect to the internet again without thinking of this author and $oft Money.an he seems.

Will Kinkaid was born exactly three hours before Megan Hardy in their tiny, safe Florida hometown.  Through the years of childhood, they live as next door neighbors, share birthdays and holidays, and are such inseparable friends that everyone calls them \\"the twins\\".  By their last year of high school, Will has moved beyond that, to thinking of his long time friend and confidant in far less platonic terms.  But instead of easing into the more adult stage of their relationship as Will hopes, the friends encounter horror unimaginable.<br /><br />After a day of swimming with their friends, Megan returns home to find her sister, niece and nephew murdered in a blood soaked bedroom.  Will is right behind her, drawn into the gory scene by Megan's screams.  Neither of them fare well in the aftermath of bloody murder.  Megan grieves incessantly and withdraws into a near catatonic silence that lands her in a mental hospital.  Will, in typical male fashion, denies the horror, tamps it down inside his mind.  And every time he sees the grieving Megan, his heart and spirit break a little more for what might have been between them. Will knows he won't survive the sorrow or the memories very long, so he moves away from family and Megan.  Twelve years later, he returns.<br /><br />Neither Will nor Megan expect their youthful ties to be intact, but both pick up where they left off without missing a beat.  They still share an easy camaraderie, a special brand of humor and a kinship that goes beyond explaining.  And the teenage ardor Will tried to hide when they were younger rapidly becomes the openly desirous kisses, looks and touches of a man in love.  Just when I was settling into the relationship and hoping it would work this time, a whole new set of murders begin.  Monstrous, inexplicable murders.  And Megan starts receiving gifts accompanied by flowers, just like the flowers that arrived the day her sister, niece and nephew were murdered.<br /><br />\\"Roses for funerals, flowers for Megan\\"<br />A murderer so far gone in madness thinks and speaks those words aloud in a quest to separate her from anyone who might keep them apart.  The demented monster kills with a message in mind, murders according to well laid plan.  It soon becomes apparent, as both Will and others struggle to protect her, that the killer plans to drive Megan insane or be the instrument of her death, or maybe both.<br /><br />Ms. Marlow really told this story well, with words that raced across each page in a style I found quite pleasing.  Her characters were believable and charismatic.  The relationship of Will and Megan was detailed realistically, with honest feelings and emotions.  The author knew what she was doing from start to finish of this story.  Any reader who likes mystery, suspense, or romance should enjoy this book immensely.\\"<BR>A murderer so far gone in madness thinks and speaks those words aloud in a quest to separate her from anyone who might keep them apart.

The year is 1824, in those glorious days when the sun never set on the British Empire.  They were days of exploration into exotic lands and grand adventures on the high seas, days when young men dreamed of making their mark on the world in impossible ways.  It was an epoch that would change the world we know in ways beyond imagination.<br /><br />Lt. James Brooke of the East India Company has been commissioned by the King, as were his father and grandfather before him.  From a life of ease and privilege in England, he travels across the world to India and Burma.  Never one to knuckle under to authority and constraints, Lt. Brooke dreams of gaining riches and fame in the Far East.  Not even devotion to his father or love for the far-from-innocent Elizabeth Wethington can deter that dream for long.<br /><br />Despite his young age, James Brooke is blessed with a force of character and courage that inspires the men he leads in battle.  Those who opt to stay beside him when he resigns his commission are an odd mix.  Si Tundok is an imposing half-breed Malay, devoted to no man or cause until he meets Lt. Brooke.  Henry Steele is a rough-around-the-edges Welshman and former soldier of the King's Army.  Captain Timothy Irons is a seaman who finds more adventure than he wanted in the company of Brooke.  Dr. Arthur Claygate and his wife Margaret find in James a humorous compatriot and friend.<br /><br />Random happenings and chance circumstance throw James into the adventure he seeks.  He finds his way to Borneo, to Sarawak.  And what an unexpected life he finds there, one of breathless wonder at the land itself and an unanticipated sympathy for the native peoples living there.  Through the eyes and experiences of James and his friends, the reader meets headhunters, fierce warriors, gentle jungle dwellers, and the cruel despots who have plundered Sarawak for years.  The author leads us into the lives and longhouses of each tribe James encounters - the Punan, Kayan, Iban, Bidayuh, and Maylay - and documents their differences in entertaining style.  We meet the villains of this story and learn to hate them for their callous greed.  Worst of all is the Maylay prince, Api, who taxes his own people to the point of starvation, and whose taste for cruelty is worsened by the impotence he tries to hide.  Not far behind Api is Geoff, the foulest Englishman who ever graced a literary page.  Loi Pek, the Chinaman, cares little for anyone or anything but opium and gold.<br /><br />James Brooke becomes Rajah of Sarawak, and soon develops an almost fatherly concern for the native people.  He gains cooperation from all tribes because of their superstitions and beliefs.  James is tall, an imposing figure to the short and stocky tribesmen.  Brave in battle, as ferocious as the most successful headhunter, James &quot;casts a long shadow&quot;, and one the natives would find difficult to bury.<br /><br />Sarawak is what might have been labeled an epic tale or sweeping saga in earlier times.  Through what must have been diligent research, Mr. Mohrlang makes this story come alive.  A decidely masculine writing style and focus adds to the feeling that this is James Brooke's story, told from his perspective in another time and age.  For readers who are history lovers, Sarawak is a must read.  For those who think that history is boring, there should be enough adventure, romance, violence, warring and intrigue between these covers to satisfy.  I recommend this book, and wonder what Jerry Mohrlang could possibly do to top it.

US	36398642	RJIRSA9XCE3T7	1588517950	23870884	Undo the Deed	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Midwest Book Review - well written parable	What if you found yourself transported back in time, to another generation?  And what if you had the opportunity to undo all the awful karma that had been handed down to you from your parents and grandparents?  Don't try to think those questions through logically or explain them away by scientific means.  Just feel, accept, and think about the possibility of undoing awful deeds.  That is what Adam-Michael James presents in this parable of domestic violence and child abuse.<br /><br />The year is 1987.  Amanda Grant has just been badly beaten, kicked and choked by her alcoholic father, Matthew.  As far back as her memory will go, all Amanda can remember of her father is terrifying alcoholic rampages and vicious fists.  She has all but given up on youthful dreams of writing songs or finding stardom as an actress.  And she's prayed for death, contemplated suicide, and covered bruises with make up until she's wearied of it all.  After Matthew almost kills her, the beaten down 17 year old is driving blindly to an unknown destination. All she remembers is bright lights, a tree, and then her world goes black.<br /><br />She wakes up in the hospital to find a different world.  Suspicious doctors, nurses, and police officers believe that all her injuries could not be caused by the accident.  At least not those choke marks on her throat.  Amanda observes the strangely skewed world around her, finally realizing she is in the year 1965.  She is befriended by a kindly sympathetic couple, and by a teacher who knows far more than he lets on about time travel.  And that is just the bare beginning of it.<br /><br />1965 is a whole new way of life for Amanda.  Gone are Madonna and the Bangles, and in their place are the Beatles and folk music.  The Vietnam war is just an obscure skirmish in some far off jungle.  Sex is not openly discussed, even if you're doing \\"it\\", and discussing domestic violence or child abuse with anyone is certainly taboo.  Amanda struggles, not always successfully, to fit into this new world.  And the worst part of it, the most mind blowing, heart chilling part of it all is that the teenage version of her father Matthew is a student at her school.<br /><br />The 1965 version of Matthew Grant is a sweet, shy, idealistic boy who plays piano and keeps his deep thoughts to himself.  This Matthew, like Amanda, is the product of a violently dysfunctional home and a father who beats him without mercy.  Amanda can't despise this Matthew as she does the older version.  The 17 year old boy is kindly and supportive, still has hopes and dreams despite his lot, and she finds herself drawn to him in odd fashion.  It's then she gets to thinking that it might be possible to \\"undo the deed\\" for future generations - change the abusive father Matthew's heart by intervening somehow with the boy.  When the young Matthew falls in love with her, the tale takes an even stranger turn.<br /><br />What Mr. James has done with this story was an emotional experience for me.  To say the reading of it broke my heart is barest understatement.  Despite the premise that some will call sci fi or fantasy, it all seemed real to me.  While reading, I did not think of time travel, parallel universes, alternate realities. or quantum leaps.  I focused, as the author did, on Matthew and Amanda and the horrors they were forced to live each day.  I experienced the same futility and despair they lived with, and I dared to hope along with them that someday - SOME day - they'd find a kindlier existence.  I'm relieved to report that the book does end on a hopeful note for both Amanda and her father Matthew.<br /><br />As a footnote to Undo the Deed, Adam-Michael James has included resources for those experiencing domestic violence and child abuse.  I suspect he is a weary but determined activist for this cause.  Mr. James writes well and tells the tale as if he's on the outside looking into broken lives.  I liked this book and recommend it, even if Undo the Deed DID break my heart.	2002-06-28

This light hearted romp is delightfully sexy with snappy dialogue and stand out characters.  Jennifer Lynn writes with humor and warmth and this book was a real treat to read.<br /><br />Beth Romano has been devastated by a faithless man who was more to her than simply lover.  When Blaine Everett comes along and proposes on a blind date, she's understandably reluctant and more than just a little fearful of his blatantly masculine approach.  In Blaine, Ms. Lynn has created THE most deliciously attentive would-be lover any female could imagine.  From day one, Blaine proposes marriage and proceeds to plan towards that end despite Beth's protestations.  The fun is in how he single mindedly steers her to the altar and, eventually, his bed.  Beth has been hoodwinked by a bright and sexy, quite successful man who isn't used to losing anything he wants.  And Blaine wants Beth, for life as his wife and nothing less.<br /><br />This was a thoroughly enjoyable book and Jennifer Lynn is a name to remember.  I'm betting Hoodwinked is just the first of many such novels from her creative mind and I can't wait to read the next one!	2002-06-27

Far from being a stereotypical romance, Nancy Marie has made it into much more with her distinctive writing style.<br /><br />As Paige escapes a violent husband with their daughter, Becky, the scent of blood permeates their battered vehicle.  Paige sees her blood soaked clothing, and her numbed mind barely recalls the violence they narrowly escaped alive.  When her car breaks down on an isolated mountain road,  the kindly seeming Lance Parrish comes to their rescue.  Lance has secret sorrows of his own, hiding just beneath his calm appearing surface.  The sight of the badly beaten Paige and her four year old daughter touches him in ways nothing has reached him in a long, long time.  He's drawn to her quiet pride, her trembling vulnerability, and wonders what kind of life she must have lead up to the point they meet.<br /><br />I loved this book.  Nancy Marie has created a portrait of the cowardice and courage that lives within abusive marriages.  Paige has far more courage than she imagines, despite her insecurity and mistrust of all things male.  The horror of her past life does not end with the chance meeting of the strong, decent Lance and his extended family.  Nor does she fall easily into love with this fine man.  When her ex-husband is driven to revenge by his insanity, the reader will fear for everyone, including Paige and her daughter, the family dog, Lance, and anyone he loves.<br /><br />This was a mystery, a thriller, and a love story rolled into one.  Pulling it together and making it work was accomplished by an author who knows a thing or two about effective writing.  This is a wonderful first novel by a gifted writer.	2002-06-20
US	36398642	R2CHI9YOAXWCCF	159129102X	840471	The Contingency of Power	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Midwest Book Review - erotic suspense thriller	Tracy Kiewel Sutterer's first book has something to appeal to everyone, regardless of what genre a reader might prefer.  It's an action thriller, with a mysterious and suspenseful story line, a touch of the supernatural, PLUS an erotic undercurrent to give it extra zing.<br /><br />Meghan Mahafy is a book store owner whose life is tame and not all that fulfilling.  Attempts by friends to set her up with the ideal man come up empty because the man that Meghan wants exists only in her mind.  And then, by chance, Kincade Lewis happens upon her bookstore in search of books to occupy his mind.  Kincade is a DEA agent whose life is going nowhere.  Subtle dissatisfaction with the world and disillusionment with life in general has robbed him of his once sharp edge.  That chance meeting in a quiet bookstore brings unexpected results for both Meghan and Kincade.<br /><br />Meghan's quiet life is explosively transformed by Kincade's power.<br />Fueled by sexual attraction too potent to ignore, they soon become what Kincade calls \\"immersed\\".  Immersion is not what you are thinking.  What starts out as simple male-female attraction, soon transforms itself into clairvoyance of the highest order.  Kincade can read Meghan's thoughts, and she his.  That skill is sharpened and empowered through meditation at first, and later by lovemaking that transcends the natural world they live in.<br /><br />Kincade sets out to free Meghan of the nightmares she has had since the night her parents died.  They end up working as a team, two bodies and essentially one mind, unraveling past and present mysteries that tie their lives together unexpectedly.<br /><br />This book should appeal to both men and women.  It has action and adventure for the thriller fans, and the love that blossoms between Kincade and Meghan is more than sufficient to fuel romantic fantasies.  I'm betting Ms. Sutterer can make a career out of writing books like this one.	2002-06-20

It's focused, well-written, and not a book to be taken lightly.  I expect to be haunted by it for quite some time to come.<br /><br />Claire Cunningham and her delightful four-year-old son Toby are kidnapped from a mall parking lot and taken to an old abandoned house out in the country.  As most mothers would, Claire fights with all that's in her to protect Toby, but her strength is not enough to hold off the inevitable.  One of the foulest, most vicious bad guys I have ever seen described - Jake - repeatedly rapes and beats Claire into submission or unconsciousness.  His simple minded sidekick Mickey joins in at first, until the shame of what he's done prevents it.  God only knows what Jake does to the precious Toby while Claire is unconscious.  The abuse and torture go on for several days, during which the captives get no food or water.  Toby seems to be in shock at first.  He sleeps too much, or stares into space, and then the seizures set in.  Jake murders Toby and then Mickey in a fit of rage, then simply drives away leaving Claire wounded and dazed.<br /><br />The kindly and concerned Glen Howell sees Claire stumbling along the highway carrying Toby's lifeless body.  She doesn't know where she is or what has happened, only that her son needs help.<br />Then begins a painful trip back to reality, and the horrifying revelation that Jake and Mickey did not act on their own.<br /><br />All I can say is that Sweet Revenge is aptly named.  I doubt too many readers will sit in judgement when Claire takes matters into her own hands.  The romantic in me wanted Claire to hook up with her long legged protector, Glen, but Ms. Brown stays true to the subject at hand.<br /><br />I was impressed with this book.  My compliments to D.J. Brown for telling this story with a single-minded purpose. She writes with such clarity that I had the sense of experiencing a true happening.  I hope, however, that this story wasn't true..	2002-06-20

Hunter's first space adventure has the humor and \\"very good at what they do\\" flavor of Star Trek and Star Wars, but with fewer heroes for me to worry over.<br /><br />Aston West has a history he would just as soon not think about.  His lot as scavenger pirate seems to suit him just fine.  Aston's only companionship is Jeanie, the Artificial Intelligence Computer, and a dwindling bottle of sweet Vladirian liquor.  Just as boredom is about to overcome him, Aston encounters an apparently abandoned Rulusian freighter with illegal weapons in her hold.  The freighter is strewn with Rulusian bodies, and protected by a scrappy woman firing a disintegrator cannon at the bewildered pirate.  With that introduction to Rione, Aston's adventure begins.  His \\"live and let live\\" attitude doesn't cut it anymore, not if he wants to survive to scavenge space in future times.  The good and the bad of several star systems coerce him into helping them by various means.  And Aston West is forced to win the day eventually, despite his personal philosophy of \\"Who needs a hero?\\"  It is during the hair raising space fighter battles that we learn of Aston's other life, before he became a space pirate.<br /><br />The author packed a lot of action into this little book.  The characters, regardless of their species or home planet, are realistic and believable.  Aston West is humorous and effective as the reluctant hero.  And I'm willing to bet we haven't seen the last of him in T.M. Hunter's books, so bring on the next one, Mr. Hunter.	2002-06-20

Erika Michelle has taken quotes from the Bible and created a lesson for us all in the persons of Sam and Joe.<br /><br />Sam and Joe are both young men, friends all their lives, but they look at life in quite a different way.  The main character, Sam, drinks too much and dabbles in the drug scene.  Despite misgivings, Joe allows Sam to drag him down into the gutter with him early on.  These young men are introduced to evil in the form of Ed, a drug dealing kingpin who travels in the underground party circuit.  It's not a pretty life and the author paints the evils and dangers with a broad brush.  Their story is frightening and disquieting.<br /><br />Sam and Joe are taken in by Ed and his cohorts Lucie and Dracula.  They party at New York's premier underground club, Hell's Cafe.  In order to partake of the \\"fun\\" at Hell's Cafe, patrons are required to receive a certain mark on their hands.  Sam accepts the mark.  An anxious Joe does not.  And thus begins a nightmare of dissolution and destruction for them both.<br /><br />The author made me fear for these two young men who are essentially unworldly despite their \\"party hearty\\" outlook.  Their fondest dream is to make it big with their garage band.  They find much more as their association with Ed continues.<br /><br />Life, death, good, evil, and the Lord's return to the Earth wielding His sword of destruction on Evil are among Sam and Joe's experiences.  Erika Michelle sets the scene and the mood well, and takes the reader with her as we witness Heaven's Fury on Hell's Cafe.  Readers will discover that Christian believers are not and cannot afford to be wimps.  It takes the highest form of human courage to overcome the evils of this world, the kind of courage demonstrated by the Living Jesus and a tortured death on that cross so long ago.  The author's message, as I took it, is that Hell's Cafe cannot win the battle, but the evil doers keep on trying.battle, but the evil doers keep on trying.	2002-06-20

Her fondest dream and goal is to own a bookstore on Somerville's main street and fill it with books both old and new.  When her beloved grandmother dies, her inheritance allows Verl to realize her dream.  She and her faithful companion, Puppy, move into Grammy's house and begin work on the building she has purchased for her bookstore.<br /><br />Verl's life expands beyond Somerville and her small dreams with an unexpected discovery.  Tucked into an old book with brittle pages, she finds a century old obituary and a faded bit of blue ribbon.  On June 5, 1899, Willie Johnson died at age 13 years, 3 months, and 17 days.  The circumstances surrounding his death are a mystery, and it took the brave lad several days to die.  That small bit of information from the past touches Verl, and soon becomes obsession.  Via internet searches she tracks down Willie Johnson's relatives.  Her plan is to return the book that had hidden Willie's obituary for 100 years, and to maybe discover a bit of his history.  Her plan is not as easily resolved as she had hoped.<br /><br />Will Noble comes to town.  His grandmother is Willie's younger sister.  Her promise to tell Verl the truth of Willie's death tempts the small town girl to travel to Wisconsin and meet the last of the dead boy's relatives.  The unfolding of an old mystery, the sad story of a long dead boy, and the beginning of what might be love come as a result of that trip.<br /><br />I won't reveal the secrets Verl discovers, or hint at other surprises she encounters.  Verl is an appealing character, as are the others you will meet in Tattered Pages.  Her persona is straightforward and spiritually strong.  Vickie Adkins tells her intriguing tale well and does it in engaging style.  She plans a sequel to this novel and I cannot wait to read it!<br /><br />review by Laurel Johnson	2002-06-20

If it isn't a best seller by now, it surely ought to be.<br /><br />Mr. Robinson writes in the first person, from the perspective of Joe Box, Private Investigator.  Joe is a transplanted Kentuckian, a Southern Gentleman of the old school, living and working in Cincinnati.  Joe Box is a reluctant hero, a man who uses wry humor and his granny's old time wisdom to make sense out of a life gone dead some time ago.  That and his taste for Cutty Sark is all that gets him through each empty day.<br /><br />Early in the book we meet the inhuman nemesis, \\"Boneless Chuck\\".  Our hero is outgunned, outmanned, and hopelessly trapped by the horrible aforementioned Chuck.  Chuck has a taste for blood, for mind and body wrecking torture.  Chuck likes to hurt, maim, and kill.  It's at the point where Joe waits helpless for his life to end that we learn what got him into this predicament.<br /><br />...<br /><br />At first I expected this to be a humourous, tongue-in-cheek book with a Thomas Magnum, P.I.-type hero.  I was wrong.  The author DOES write with self-effacing humor and pulls it off effectively.  But I was not prepared for his range, his ability to set a mood, for the sorrow that Joe Box wasted half his life reliving.  And I learned that the title I thought so humorous represents a heart breaking episode in Joe's past - a revelation that caught me quite off guard.<br /><br />John Laurence Robinson writes in a fresh style, with a distinctive \\"voice\\".  He and Sock Monkey Blues are one of a kind.  If the reading public is fortunate, he will follow this book with another, very soon.	2002-06-09

Detective Sergeant Albert McCoy is a little worn around the edges, perhaps approaching burnout from the sights he's seen on the job.  McCoy's life is a simple one off duty.  He lives alone with his dog and frequents his favorite watering hole with friend and partner Otis Springfield.  Emotional investments are out of the picture.  The quiet and slightly cynical McCoy works methodically at closing each new case that comes his way, until he meets the badly beaten Michael O'Conner.  O'Conner has been beaten beyond recognition. almost to death, and nobody can figure why.<br /><br />What McCoy expects to be another routine mugging investigation turns personal the minute he lays eyes on the younger man.  Memories so painful that McCoy wants to \\"turn and run\\" come back to him beside O'Conner's hospital bed.  It could be his kid brother lying half dead in that bed.  McCoy struggles to remain professional and distance himself from the sorrow of losing his brother not that long ago.  With one small paragraph on page ten, the writer skillfully, succinctly, lets us into McCoy's mind and heart.<br /><br />I like this author's writing style.  He made me care about McCoy with simple words and phrases, and let me see beneath the cynical veneer.  The dialog is realistic.  Woven in as the story unfolds are the tools McCoy uses to solve a complicated case.<br />The characters, also, seemed like real people.  I could see them, feel what they felt as the crime unravels and McCoy identifies the criminal.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the plot.  McCoy is not cut from the Mike Hammer or Dirty Harry mold.  He's a very different type of hero.  I believed in him.  And although I understand where and why the author dubbed McCoy \\"unreal\\", he seemed quite real to me.  I'm hoping Dennis Collins gives us more of his \\"unreal McCoy\\".	2002-06-08

I don't pretend to be an expert in the \\"thriller\\" genre, but I do appreciate good writing, well-drawn characters, and dialog that crackles with realism.  This book has that.<br /><br />Nick Seven is the main character, trying to live down his past in Key Largo.  Nick is given to solitary reflections on the death of his wife and a job that went sour.  Some memories are better left alone.  Nursing his favorite scotch and smoking Winstons as he takes in breathtaking sunsets seems to be Nick's only comfort.<br /><br />The ex-C.I.A. anti-terrorist operative turned successful restauranteur doesn't live his peaceful life for very long.  His old boss wheedles him back into action and calls up Nick's old partners, \\"Team Seven\\".  The one good thing that comes of this reacquaintance is that Felicia Hagens comes back into Nick's life.<br /><br />Nick is nobody's patsy, and soon resumes the tough guy image that made him so good at his old job.  Reluctance to put another woman he cares about in harms way is soon forgotten as a new relationship begins.  Felicia's voracious sexuality takes Nick outside his sorrow and brings him back to life, but even that delight cannot deter him from the task at hand.  Nick works his way through a convoluted group of evil doers, taking each new lead as it comes with his usual aplomb.<br /><br />This is a hard-edged, sexy and stylish book with a savvy, no-nonsense hero.  I liked it, and hope to see more out of Tim Smith very soon.	2002-06-04

It should be required reading for every medical professional. Doctors, nurses, and therapists, should have to read it twice, once in their first year of study and again before they graduate. I'm serious.<br />And that is not to say that only medical professionals will benefit from reading this well-written book. Kathleen Bosworth tells her touching story from the lay person's point of view. From that first heart gripping moment when she gets the bad news about her mother's stroke by phone, to the last page, the author's personality shines through. Her outrage, quiet humor, and sense of decency make this book stand out in ways it never might have if a lesser writer had created it.<br />Ms. Bosworth's mother had a stroke. That much can be gleaned from the title. From there the author takes each reader through a maze of doctors, nurses, and therapists who are less than helpful. Some are downright rude, or maybe ignorant. Her search for answers, and for professionals who have hearts as well as brains is detailed honestly. With the support of a loving, close-knit family, she struggles to find a constructive way of managing her mother's care.<br />Kathleen Bosworth educates herself about treatment plans, possible outcomes, patients rights, living wills, and insurance coverage. With courage and determination, she and her brother fight the system to get their mother the loving care she needs and deserves. I recommend this book to everyone and repeat again: This is a stunning story.	2002-06-01

She is surrounded by loyal friends, devoted employees, and a protective ex-lover, James, who would gladly die to keep her safe. James and Geneva work as operatives for \\"94\\", a U.S. Security Agency.

After that chance meeting, Tyler moves from a life of abuse and neglect into a world of privilege and unconditional love. The lonely child cannot help but fear that this new and wondrous life is a dream that will be snatched away at any second.<br />The author alternates effectively between the loving relationship established by Tyler and Geneva, and the dark, dangerous underworld that is Geneva's work life. Ms. Graves introduces us to the crazed nemesis Ryan Walsh, who has been driven over the edge by the death of his pregnant wife and unborn child. Walsh is bent on destroying Geneva and James and focuses on this goal with maniacal determination. Walsh's cohorts are equally evil and determined, but for different reasons.

The author herself describes this story as a \\"soap opera\\", but I thought it went far deeper than that. What Ms. Barry has here are a few small slices of the real world revealed.<br />The voice of this story is Susan, who is both blessed and cursed. She's blessed with what seems to be the ideal marriage and a wonderful stay at home life, cursed with a rebellious, sexually active daughter and the spectre all loving wives fear the worst - her husband's infidelity. The author made me care about the characters, their joys and sufferings. When Susan's doting husband, Jeff, lusted after his sex-starved secretary, I was enraged. And when her best friend reveals an alternative lifestyle, Susan's struggle to accept this bit of knowledge made me chuckle.<br />You'll find a little something for everyone in this book. You can help Susan solve a mystery and face danger with her. And you can laugh, struggle, and rage right along with her, just like I did, as she tries to make sense out of a life gone askew. Ms. Barry transplanted me into Susan's life. I lived it with her. Not many books throughout the years have managed that.	2002-06-01

Mr. Grover does his homework, his research, and that makes Strike Hard shine.  Whether it was the awesome military capability so few common citizens know much about, or mortal wounds inflicted by snipers or combatants, I found every word believable.  This is a book that both men and women will enjoy.<br /><br />Located in the rolling hills of Kentucky, much of the action and investigation takes place in and around Ft. Knox and Ft. Campbell.  Our hero is Tony Wilson, a buck Sergeant and Advanced Individual Training Instructor at Ft. Knox.  Tony is a man who lives with quiet thoughts and likes it that way.  He shares a comfortable long-term friendship with Sgt. Karen Harris and is blithely unaware of her affection for him.<br /><br /> Tony Wilson is not a die-hard warrior or a macho skirt chaser.  His mind is focused on friendship, humor, living a calm and honorable life, and earning a Bachelor's Degree in Criminology.  Enter Lt. Colonel Nathan Hooks.  Nathan is near retirement and finds himself faced with the unexplainable theft of military weapons and the suspicious deaths of several military staff members.  When Tony applies to do his practicum with the Military Police Investigation Office, Nathan takes the younger man on board.  Smart, with a calmly focused, analytical mind, Tony helps uncover a reason for the stolen weapons and murdered soldiers.  He soon finds himself up against an old line Nazi nemesis - Hans - who will stop at nothing to reach his goal.  This includes assassinating Tony and any other person who tries to stop him.<br /><br />Hans and fellow Nazi Heinrich plot to breech Ft. Knox and rid themselves of Tony.  In his own quiet, determined way, Tony battles the blizzard of the century, struggles to stay alive and to protect everyone and everything he loves and respects.  I just have to say this.

I discovered intelligent prose that varied from wondrously descriptive to poetic, from gritty to harsh, and all points in between.  And I found myself caring about the odd mix of draks, dryads, elves, dwarves, and humans in this book.<br /><br />Gen of Mercured is born with gifts that only two other living humans possess.  This gift, called mindsight, increases as he progresses into adolescence.  His parents nurture the boy, protecting him until the day the Prophecy will be fulfilled.  In many ways, Gen is a typical boy, until he is trained in rudimentary martial skills by his warrior father.  It is when Gen and his chums Jayce and Page embark on a seemingly innocent camping trip that his mindsight kicks in and he learns of the Prophecy.<br /><br />Gen knows his future belongs to the Prophecy, even though he doesn't fully understand his part in it.  According to time shrouded legend, two Innocents will be born to play out the fates of the world, and a mysterious Bredling will appear.  This Bredling will bring together the separate races through his blood and begin a new race that surpasses the powerful elvens of old.  Gen suspects he is one of the Innocents, but his inexperience prevents him fully understanding that he may also be the \\"Bredling\\".<br /><br />The unworldly Gen experiences desire, and soon passion, when he meets Seena the Elven Queen.  Love blooms and quickly progresses to full flower between commoner and Queen before Gen's dreams of sharing life with her are dashed.  His broken heart is only partially mended by the lovely Leiss from Arcena and Princess Aloura.  Both women are intrigued by Gen's mindsight power and his reputation as warrior, and he in turn is sorely tempted by their beauty, but Seena remains first in Gen's heart.<br /><br />Gen is not a one dimensional hero.

And through Book I of Mindsight, he remains that somewhat bewildered  adolescent boy in search of truth and wisdom.<br /><br />Awareness was just that.

Troubled heroes fascinate me, especially when they live by their own code of decency. Mr. Nelson's Andy Paul is my kind of hero! Andy is strong and capable, a loner who can't fully escape his past as a Navy SEAL. He travels the world as a photographer, capturing beauty and human pathos with the camera's eye, trying to live down what he considers failure as a SEAL commander.<br />The reader doesn't learn about the origin of Andy's nightmares straightaway. He thinks his solitary thoughts on a much anticipated fishing trip in the Ozark Mountains. Andy welcomes isolation, and seeks to refresh a world weary spirit with the rugged beauty of his surroundings. . His underlying decency and humor come to the fore when he meets Fran Whitler, a widowed mother who keeps a secret past to herself. Their attraction for each other is immediate, and then Fran's hidden past returns to haunt them both. Andy is drawn into Fran's nightmare, and in the process must relive his own shadowed past.<br />In this first book by Richard Alan Nelson, I found myself at first sharing Andy's love of nature's peace. Descriptive passages of mountain scenery served as a pleasing backdrop to the tension building rapidly around the ex-military hero.

At age eight, Cally Jo McAllister sat in a crowded courtroom and testified courageously against her mother's murderer. It was a horrifying scene, even to those adults present in that silent court.<br />The reader feels Cally's fear, her determination to be strong, and shares the overwhelming terror from a child's viewpoint. The evil. The monster. The shadowed darkness. The seeping blood that Cally thinks is strawberry pop. Through Cally's eyes, I saw the monster's face. Her testimony sends him off to prison, where he dies and Cally Jo is safe. Right? Guess again. We accompany her to adulthood knowing full well that the danger did not end for Cally in the courtroom<br />Nancy Mehl has skillfully crafted a tightly woven suspense thriller.<br />I was mesmerized. I learned quite early that the wrong man went to prison for the crime. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, became a suspect in my mind. I cringed through Cally's recurring nightmare's, as her subconscious mind attempted to reveal the true monster. And I shuddered as two potential love interests entered her life, fearing one of them might do her in. I met the shadowed monster, made more fearful by his obvious insanity.<br />The monster could be anybody.<br />Ms. Mehl is a gifted writer and story teller.

Every so often I run across a book that stays in my mind and heart for weeks after reading it. This is just such a book. It was not what I expected in any way. Oh, I suspected it would be well worth reading, but the raw heart of this woman embedded in her prose was overwhelming. Her story made me cry until my nose ran and I couldn't see to read.<br />Shirley Johnson's non-fiction story is simply written, from a heart that manages to hope despite her struggles. How this young mother with small children found the strength to hope that her marriage would hold together is beyond my imagination. Years of physical and mental abuse, infidelity, and broken promises were all she had to show for her devotion. Despite it all, she still believed her marriage could be saved.<br />Hope finally dies on a long road trip south. With a callousness I found blood chilling, the author's husband puts on a loving masquerade to lure his wife and children far from home. He abandons his frightened wife and helpless babies, leaves them to fend for themselves. His parting shot is that he's found another woman and he wants a divorce. Reading of her shock and fear, her loneliness, almost broke my heart. In the wake of this abandonment, she turns to an always faithful God in her despair. Her painfully honest talks with God about every aspect of her life are recorded in stark detail. I imagined Shirley Johnson's tears on every page, in every prayer.<br />Don't expect closure or a happy ending to this first book of a continuing series. She will find her treasure with God's help before the series ends, I'm sure, and I look forward to future books with anticipation. The author's writing style is simple, effective, and her walk of faith is inspiring. I recommend this book to anyone who finds themselves in the throes of a divorce, or to those who need to understand the pain that comes of broken hearts and marriages....	2002-05-20
