The other Thlassa May books are a readable and enjoyable part of my library, but you would expect more after this first novel gem. It has all the mystery, bloodshed and romance you could want in a fantasy and the characters are fantastic. It is one of the few fantasy books I read over and over (not as much as Tolkien or C.s Lewis, but alot). Buy it, and get the other three or four titles, but only because they are readily available for 50 cents or so.	2003-04-12

I like reading them though, even though all the material can be found in the yearly collections.  I own every Calvin and Hobbes ever published, including all of the treasuries containing excerpts from the yearly compilations. Of course, that is a bit redundant, but for some reason I enjoy reading through the treasuries almost as much as I enjoy reading the sequential comics in the compilations. I would reccomend getting all the books and saving the treasuries for after you have them all. One treasury I especially like is the tenth anniversary book, and I would reccomend that be your first collection after buying all the compilations.	2002-09-30

Even so, 30 pages into it I stopped reading and went and got Catcher in the Rye off the shelf and spent the rest of my Saturday afternoon reading all of it. Not to say this is a bad book, just a tad superfluous. I mean, I'm sure someone could redo Huckleberry Finn and it would be OK, but what's the point? If you want a first person narrative of the angst of a young man, read Catcher. Of course, this book is not a complete..., and it has its moments, but the whole is not as good as the sum of its parts, as is often the case for a first time novelist (Goldman was 26 at the time). There is plenty of room for original variations on the Catcher theme, which was revolutionary at the time, but this book does not fill the bill. I read it, I may read it again sometime, but it is not particularly fantastic, in my opinion. I know others are enamored with it, and I see some strong points, but don't expect too much. Other stuff by Goldman is better, most notably The Princess Bride.	2002-09-27

His well chronicled life (mostly chronicled by Durrell) begins with the hilarious, and very succesfull, \\"My family and Other Animals\\". It is ably followed up with the equally hilarious \\"Birds, Beasts and Relatives\\". Both books are full of tales from the Durrell family's years on the Greek Island of Corfu, pre WWII. Little Gerry dives right into the flora and fauna of the island, including its human fauna. I own very few nonfiction books with such a plethora of memorable characters. Now, of course, we get to the volume in question. It is plenty good, and worth multiple readings over years, as is \\"The Overloaded Ark\\" and several other books detailing trips to collect animals. A word of warning, don't go nuts and buy all the zillion Durrell titles. Some of them are out of print for a reason and were most likely dashed off by Durrell to finance a collecting trip or two...	2002-09-27

His novels I can generally take or leave, but this book I just have to own. It combines the novel and screenwritting techniques and the product is uniquely enjoyable. I usually read all the way through it in one sitting, totally neglecting all other aspects of my life until I have finished it. Few books grip me that way, but this is one of them. It is a fairy tale with some unique elements that make it hilarious and breathtaking. It doesnt take itself too seriously, allowing for some great humor and unexpected sequences. Even so, you care about the story and the characters, and the humor doesnt make a mockery of larger themes in the story. This book is unlike anything else in my collection and I reccommend you add it to yours. Of course, the movie is really great too.  Of course, you should try to find the unabridged version by S. Morganstern, and while you are doing that you can can book your cruise to the country of Florin and visit Morganstern's childhood home.  Wink, nudge.	2002-09-21

Her essential humanity emerges, and it is a good case study and an interesting read, historically, philosophically and personally.  She is no Mark Twain or Billy Faulkner, but her life was interesting and her prose adequately conveys the milieu she became enmeshed in.  A fair degree of antecedent historical knowledge is necessary to fully enjoy this book, but you most likely have that or you wouldn't be reading about Emma to begin with.  If you don't, or find that you are getting lost in the history and sequence, it would pay to do a little research to better understand what she lived through.  It will also help you spot bias on Goldman's part.  I heartily recommend this book.  It is informative, enlightening and entertaining to boot.	2002-09-21

Dont allow yourself to be PC'ed into not enjoying it.  Waldeck had an interesting life and I find his writing style enjoyable, even though, like I said, it is a bit dated.  \\"Treks across the Veldt\\" is also very good, but \\"The White Panther\\" is head and shoulders above anything Waldeck has written.  Unfortunately, all these books are going to cost you 40 bucks or so.  \\"The White Panther\\" is especially costly and hard to find.  I got lucky and was the sole bidder for a copy on Ebay and so I did Ok.  The other books can be sometimes be found at a more reasonable price.  Most likely, if these books were not an integral part of your childhood you wont want to pay so much for them, but if you can find them at an OK price you should enjoy adding them to your library.	2002-08-30

I am not doing that for this one because fans should know that this book is a bit different.  It came to be as a result of an exhibition Waterson did in Ohio and has more of an artsy feel.  It also has brief commentary by the cartoonist at the bottom of each page along with each set of Sunday panels.  The format is a double print of each Sunday page. On the left-hand page you see it in black and white sketch version and on the right-hand page the final version in color.  The left-hand side has eraser-marks and white out and other details you dont see in the finished color version.  Personally, I love it and I am not really an artist at all.  The quality of the book adds greatly to the appeal with nice super high-quality paper and amazing detail and crisp printing technique.  The pages are not like most C&H books, with a matte finish.  These are glossy and slick with great details.  When my copy arrived I almost thought I had accidentally been sent a presentation copy or something, but all the ones I have seen are like mine; they just did a great job with the printing and formatting.  Now I wish all my C&H books came with this kind of detail and sharp images, but you can't have everyting, and C&H is not so much about glossy images anyway.  Having said that, I feel that this book allows the reader to see and appreciate the beauty in many of Watterson's Sunday pages.  The black and whites also show a lot of detail you won't get in other C&H books.  Of course, you also get a bunch of really good cartoons, as usual, but there are only half as many, since every one takes up two full pages with the two versions.  To sum up, the material is old, the commentary is new and the quality is great.  Get the other C&H books first, but then consider this one to spice up your collection with something a bit different.	2002-08-28

If you want a big book of arcane knowledge there are an abundance; this is not one of them. This book is reccomended if you already have a fairly broad knowledge base to draw on. Otherwise it is meaningless and gives you rote memory, which is a waste of your time. I reccomend this book to fill in the gaps of your knowledge.

It is my feeling that Bill Watterson had enough integrity and ethics to prevent the syndicate from cranking out endless meaninglessly repetitive compilations. Of course, he did quit partly because he was becoming disgusted with many of the commercial aspects of his work. With most comics, even good ones, the collections get stale after a few. Watterson's collections dont. There are a dozen or so C&H compilations/collections, but you wont be dissapointed with owning the whole shebang, especially since Watterson frequently did a lot of extra work to ensure that each collection had something new to offer. Even without this extra stuff, Watterson's body of work is extensive enought to warrant owning all these collections. He was steadily cranking out great material for a decade or so, and if you are like me you will be reading some C&H weekly for as long as you are on this earth, so tons of books is not a bad thing. Basically, I wholeheartedly reccomend all the books. If you like one you will like them all. They only get better as you get to know the characters. Watterson never goes for the cheap laugh by having any of the comic's principals act out of character. As you progress through the years with C&H, and I do reccomend reading them in order, you will see how art progresses and grows when the artist is committed to excellent work. So, go get the first one, titled simply Calvin & Hobbes, and then start down the enjoyable road to making Calvin and his tiger a pleasant little chunk of your life. (Yes, i have repeated this review for every C&H book I own, wich is all of them, so get used to seeing all this anytime you look one of them up)	2002-08-23

Basically, I wholeheartedly reccomend all the books. If you like one you will like them all. They only get better as you get to know the characters. Watterson never goes for the cheap laugh by having any of the comic's principals act out of character. As you progress through the years with C&H, and I do reccomend reading them in order, you will see how art progresses and grows when the artist is committed to excellent work. So, go get the first one, titled simply Calvin & Hobbes, and then start down the enjoyable road to making Calvin and his tiger a pleasant little chunk of your life.

It is humongous, but you can get it and save some cash.  These books have a lot of depth to them and aren't the average sci-fi \\"lets see how many futuristic ways we can kill people\\" approach.  Lawhead's character's are developed over time.  Sometimes they will surprise you.  The standard first chapter synopis of main characters is absent.  You have to follow the development of the individuals throughout the books.  Lawhead writes with a different sense of pace and buildup than you may be used to from his other series.  I read this series as a kid and have always liked it for its uniqueness.  The books create a believable world and a complex society while leaving the thinking reader plenty of mysterious clues and hints to ponder.  Lots of fun elements of political science, anthropology and sociology undergird this first book,which takes place mostly in Dome.  Don't expect everything to be spelled out right away, and don't expect wholesale slaughter and gigantic battle scenes.  The great sci-fi epics like \\"Dune\\", and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" succeed because they give a reader a sense of  reality.  Events seem like real history.  The \\"Dome\\" books don't reach the level of Herbert or Tolkien; few if any books do.  However, they have an element of this same reality that allow the reader to become immersed and enter a new world and, after all, isnt that the point of sci-fi?	2002-08-23

Yellow Eyes, the story of a Cougar is his best in my opinion, but Broken Fang is also excellent. The action is nonstop and the descriptions are great. Broken Fang and Yellow Eyes are the only two of his books I own, and they never get dusty on my shelf. The plot is compelling and the characters intriguing, even though they are mostly wild animals. Montgomery is one of the few nature tales authors who can really describe the mentality of an animal in a way that somehow seems to jibe with reality. These books got me hooked on reading, and I'm sure I will read them many times more.	2002-07-26

The other Thlassa May books are a readable and enjoyable part of my library, but you would expect more after this first novel gem.  It has all the mystery, bloodshed and romance you could want in a fantasy and the characters are fantastic.  It is one of the few fantasy books I read over and over (not as much as Tolkien or C.s Lewis, but alot).  Buy it, and get the other three or four titles, but only because they are readily available for 50 cents or so.	2002-05-08

(if you can find it)	Old Yeller is the alltime Gipson classic, but this one is a close second and noone knows about it. It by no means covers the same ground as Old Yeller. It is also a first person narrative by a young boy but the feel is very different. The Gipson hallmarks of golden youth tinged with tragedy are there, but the overall feel is more lighthearted. There is more humor, which Gipson is master of. The book is suitable for all ages and will be enjoyed by anyone who takes the time to read it, and who is willing to pay 20$ or so to get a copy.  It is very hard to find.  I was on a waiting list for three months before a copy in my price range was available.  If you want to just read it and not own it interlibrary loan will be able to scare you up a copy.  And dont \\"lose\\" it after interlibrary gets it to you, if you do you will go straight to the lower levels of purgatory with the other book hoarders.	2002-05-08
