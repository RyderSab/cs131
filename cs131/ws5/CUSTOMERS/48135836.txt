Sullivan spent the better part of a year watching rats in Manhattan - his observations and interviews with exterminators are the basis of the book.  But in discussing rats, Sullivan shows us how eerily similar we are to these rodents.  For example, we prefer the same foods - the richer, greasier, and higher in cholesterol the better.  (Rats will eat their veggies - but prefer Chinese take out, evidentially.  Go figure ...)  Rats have a social heirarchy much like humans do.  And, like humans, rats can overpopulate and strip an ecosystem of its resources with disasterous consequences.  Living successfully side-by-side with humans, Sullivan convincingly shows that rats are very much the other side of the coin to people.<br /><br />His humanization of rats was unexpected - especially for a \\"scientific\\" book.  But the device worked, helping to avoid the \\"yuck\\" factor I otherwise would have had reading about animals most consider vermin.  It is a fascinating account that gave me a new appreciation of the resiliance and adaptability of rats.  Recommended reading.	2005-08-29

His observations are wry and witty, putting the reader with him as he endures the privations and hardships that are a grunt's bread and butter.  As a Gulf War vet, much of what he says is familiar - but his is was a very different war.  A collection of vignettes, it reads much like a dream sequence, each story generally related to the others, but each wholly unique.  Highly recommended reading for those who want to gain an apolitical perspective of the Iraq war from the line.	2005-08-26

Divided into thirds (a section each on the Early, High and Late middle ages), it has a solid representation of source materials on religious and political life.

In this, he succeeds.  As a previous reviewer noted, Hampson also attempts to encourage the reader to take on the acutal sources by the thinkers themselves.  In this, he misses his mark.<br /><br />The book is divided into two sections: 1715 - 1740 and 1740 - 1789.  The first half looks at the effects of the Scientific Revolution on European thought with specific attention given to Locke, Newton, Montesquieu and Voltaire; the second half examines Linneaus, Rousseau, Diderot, Smith and Kant.  His summary and observations of these intellecutals is excellent - which, of course makes it difficult to convince readers to tackle their work first-hand.<br /><br />It is not light reading, geared probably towards the serious student of history.  But is is worthwhile, and it may in fact whet the reader's appetite for more.	2005-08-19

After each example is a \\"debrief\\" of what happened and how it is relevant to the chapter. The lessons deal with such common issues as the use of terrain, unit mobility, problems of unit control in battle, communication and fire and movement.<br /><br />The real strength of the book is its attempt to teach the reader how to think operationally rather than to memorize specific \\"hard-and-fast\\" rules.  The variety of examples illustrating different solutions to problems with an eye towards developing a habit of mind that is tactically flexable was what I found to be most rewarding in its reading.<br /><br />Overall it is an outstanding instructional read.  However, it does show its age with its lack of disucssion on mechanized infantry, air support and tanks, and its cursory attention to artillery.  Nonetheless a highly recommended for those interested in tactics at the field-grade rank.	2005-08-17

Beyond that, it is not appropriate, as Battuta was not only better traveled, but also seeing the world through very different eyes.  It is the Islamic view of the world that makes this book so wonderful.<br /><br />Dunn has done a magnificient job of making the language accessable and understandable to a modern audience, while still maintaining the author's eye for observation and detail.  Traveling across North and East Africa, the Near East, and into China, Ibn Battuta traverses the breadth of the Islamic world, sharing his thoughts on local color, custom and ideas.<br /><br />It is a fascinating travelouge, but also a rare glimpse of a place and time that has long since gone away.

First, about the book.<br /><br />Perry begins with a very brief preview of the Middle East before Islam - this is really a disservice, as one of the cradles of world civilization is in the Near East, and it has since been of great significance.  One chapter only scratches the surface.  The next third of the book covers the birth, growth and spread of Islam through the end of the 18th century. Again, my primary complaint is that it covers the material an inch deep and a mile wide - much attention is given the Ottomans, while there is scant information on the Safavids (or Persia) and Mughals (of India) and even then it is entirely too short.  The majority of the book is concerned with events in the 19th and 20th centuries.  The information is good, and is the best part of the book - but without a deeper background, I found it lacking.<br /><br />It is an easy read, if terribly general.  For those interested in a history of Islam with a little more depth that is still easy to read I would strongly recommend Bernard Lewis' _A History of the Middle East_.  For an excellent discussion of the Islamic world in great detail, I would recommend Alber Hourani's _A History of the Muslim Peoples_; and to gain a stronger understanding of the modern Middle East, try David Fromkin's _A Peace to End All Peace_.  Perry is good, but these are much better.	2005-08-10

The degree of historical detail and weaving of first-hand accounts into his narrative are a real strength of the book, and certainly keep the reader's attention.  Another strength was its balance in presenting both the British perspective of the revolution (from the debate in Parliament to go to war, to the various attitudes of the Generals and soldiers in the field) and the American perspective.  The only criticism I have is the relative lack of good maps - those provided date from the Revolutionary War period, and therefore lack clear detail for close scrutiny.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those interested in military history (particularly the seige of Boston, the New York campaign and the assults on Trenton and Princeton).	2005-08-04

The only shortcoming of the collection is the narrow and specialized nature of the book - lay readers would certainly be put off by the technical data and interpretations of evidence cited.<br /><br />These criticisms aside, the material presented here is solidly researched and well argued and presents a good overview of the scholarly debate over the precise nature of early human evolution.	2005-07-31

That is to say, one has no idea how old some of the obscenities are; imagine using words like \\"swell,\\" \\"groovy,\\" or \\"masher\\" in contemporary speech and one gets the idea.<br /><br />Another shortcoming is the transliteration of some of the words: certainly many of them one would not want to use in polite conversation, but there certainly is a spectrum of vulgarity (from \\"darn!\\" to words that cannot be reproduced here.)  Some indication of the strength of the words would have been helpful rather than a literal translation as provided here.<br /><br />I recommend the book, with reservations:  before using any language Drummond has included, you may want to run it by a close friend first.	2005-07-31

He gave me this.  It was a veritable cornicoupia of information, even as the authors sought to provide their own answers to quesitons of acadmeic controversey.<br /><br />The central question Stringer and Gamble seek to answer is:  are modern humans kin to Neaderthals, or are we distantly related?  In answering this, readers are treated to a briefing on the ice age world of the Lower and Middle Paleolithic, the relation of Neanderthals to other early humans, the way in which Neanderthals have been understood (and seen) by science and the public, before the book really hits its stride in disucssing the archaeology of Neanderthal sites and what they tell us about these early humans.<br /><br />The authors belive that modern humans are related to (rather than directly from) Neanderthals, and that by the Upper Paleolithic, were being replaced by modern humans coming out of Africa (\\"Out of Africa II\\").  The evidence in support of this is strong, although not overwhelming: mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) as well as behavioural data are primarily used.<br /><br />In all, it was a worthwhile and fascinating read, and certainly provides more depth on the specific case of Neanderthals than other books on early humans.	2005-07-30

His latest book, _Liberating the Gospels_ will certainly anger Christians who have a more conservative and literal interpretation of the Bible.  With that said, it seems a number of reviewers are quick to criticize Spong without benefit of having read the book.  Nonetheless, I found his arguments and evidence well written and well presented, if troubling.<br /><br />The main point the Bishop makes is that the Gospels were never intended to be taken literally, and that the message the early Church fathers wanted to make is diluted and misunderstood  when they are.  Rather, Spong believes the story of Jesus needs to be understood in the Jewish \\"midrashic\\" tradition of drawing from the sacred past of the Jewish faith in order to describe the reality at the time of their writing.<br /><br />Spong begins by stating that early Christians were Jews - a point that most Biblical historians (and theologians) would not dispute.  He then goes on to argue that given the \\"Jewishness\\" of the gospel writers, we need to read the gospels with this understanding.  As a result, Spong arrives at some startling conclusions: that there may not have been a Joseph or Mary or a manger in which Jesus lay as a newborn; that there was no literal raising of Lazarus from the dead; no miraculous feeding of the multitude; the Jesus did not make the Sermon on the Mount; Judas Iscariot is a midrashic invention; and that there was no literal Jerusalem resurrection appearances.  These claims to some are tantamount to blasphemy, hence the controversial nature of the book.<br /><br />But Spong claims he does not seek to destroy Christianity (as some may accuse him of) - instead, he seeks to remove the fantastic and magical from the Gospels (Spong refers to these examples as \\"legends\\") with what he feels is the true message of Christianity: that Jesus \\"called people into wholeness and oneness ... open(ing) the ultimate sign of human finitude ... and transformed it.\\"<br /><br />From a historical perspective, Spong cannot be criticized.  Theologically, his ideas have some merit, but are not without a great deal of controversey.de ... and transformed it.\\"    From a historical perspective, Spong cannot be criticized.

As the stakes are raised in the struggle between good and evil, so are the casualties of war.<br /><br />The character development resonated most with me - there is a perceptible shift from adolescence into adulthood here, especially with Harry.

While involved in such serious business, Ms. Woolson must also combat the social expectations (and limitations) placed on women in the mid- 19th century: a mother who wants to marry her off, a boss who wants her fired (the law is, after all, almost exclusively a male domain), and others underestimating her intelligence, pluck, courage and resolve.<br /><br />While I truly enjoyed the story and the reappearance of characters introduced in Tallman's first novel, _Murder on Nob Hill_, I didn't think it was as good as her earlier work.  The climatic unveiling of the REAL killer in a court-room seemed a bit melodramatic for me, and the way in which \\"loose ends\\" were tied up seemed a bit contrived and forced.

I can understand how some may get frustrated with the \\"terseness\\" of Hemingway's sentences - honestly, I liked it; and I can empathize with those reviewers who were not fans of the ending - I was a bit troubed by it, too.

As Harry Flashman - cad, womanizer, cheat, theif and coward (and also a Knight of the Bath, recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor and Victoria Cross) - winds his way through the West, readers are treated to a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" of the time.<br /><br />The first half of the book is about the \\"opening of the West,\\" as Harry travels the Oregon and Santa Fe trails to California as a '49er.  Along the way he makes the acquaintance of such larger-than-life personalities as Kit Carson, Gallatin, Mangas Colorado and Geronimo.  The second half of the book Harry returns West, to meet the likes of Geo. Custer, Spotted Tail, Crazy Horse, Anson Mills, Wild Bill Hickock (and a surprise for both Flashman and the reader.)<br /><br />The history, of course, is impeccable.  Fraser takes readers across the West from Independence, MO to Santa Fe, north to Ft. Laramie, from Ft. Robinson, the Little Big Horn, and finally, Deadwood. Quite an adventure, indeed.  In the middle of it all is Harry Flashman, ever the scoundrel; and this book will not disappoint, as Harry is more devilish than usual.  It was a pretty involved and lengthy read, but with so much material (and so many personalities) to cover, it was very much worthwhile.	2005-06-27

Details about the use of cadavers in medical experiments (anatomy labs, their use in forensics, organ donations and as crash test dummies) were for me the most interesting and the strongest parts of the book.  The rest of it  (the use of corpses in decapitation experiments, crucifixion, plastination and in various medicinal concotions) did not hold my attention as the medical applications did.<br /><br />I also had trouble with Roach's humor.  Perhaps it was her way of lightening up a serious (and no doubt unpleasant and uncomfortable) topic.  Several other reviewers didn't mind it, and even enjoyed it, so I suspect it is just me on this one - but I simply didn't \\"get\\" her humor.<br /><br />Either way, it is a fascinating book, and a worthwhile read, but I far prefered Jessica Snyder Sach's _Corpse_.	2005-06-27

It was almost enough to make me stop reading right there.<br /><br />But of course, Snicket makes up for these annoyances by not only filling in more of the ongoing plot with more information about VFD, its codes, the Snicket brothers and the Baudelaire parents.  I was also pleased about the reintroduction of Phil (from the Lucky Smells Lumbermill). There are a number of flashbacks as well, making it a necessity to have read the previous books.<br /><br />The story continues with the shades of grey regarding \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" that began with _The Carnivorous Carnival_, which I also found entertaining.

What impresses me the most about Akunin, though, is how varied stylistically his books are.  _The Turkish Gambit_ is very reminiscient of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes as opposed to his other novels.

Having run out of relatives to stay with, the Baudelaire orphans are shipped off to a boarding school in the fifth installment of \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\\"<br /><br />The Prufrock Academy, of course, is hardly an improvement from their previous living arrangements, as Violet, Klaus and Sunny have to contend with toe-biting crabs, violin recitals, strawberry shortcake and lots of running of laps.  This is the most miserable the orphans have been so far.  Yet, as ever, there is a silver lining, as the Baudelaires meet the Quagmire triplets (twins?), students at Prufrock who share similar tales of woe.  With the good comes some bad - not only does Count Olaf show up to complicate matters, Snicket also introduces us to Carmella Spats - sort of a cross between Veruca Salt and Draco Malfoy.<br /><br />The Austere Academy begins to broaden the story line of the series, as readers learn more about the Baudelaire past, find some possible clues to their future, and have the cast of characters expanded.

As with the previous stories, there is some good and some bad.<br /><br />The good: Jerome is nice, and really wants to do right by the orpahns.  The bad: Eseme has \\"adopted\\" the orphans simply because \\"orphans are in\\".  (Eseme is obsessed with style.) The Baudelaires live in an enormous apartment (good); but it is at the top of 66 flights of stairs. (Bad.)  And of course, Count Olaf - in another silly disguise - attempts to kill off the Beaudelaires for their family fortune.  (VERY bad.)<br /><br />This book seemed a bit more \\"mature\\" than the previous books in the series.  Adults, the children realize, can be BOTH good and bad - and that often bad things are done with good intentions.  The message was subtle, but a good one for young readers, I think.

But his assertion that intelligence agencies therefore \\"create\\" problems for them to solve as the primary method to preserve themselves is a gross generalization. This accusation is particularly false regarding the intelligence in this country.  The job of an intelligence professional is to provide the best information possible.  In order for this to be of any value, it needs to be as objective as possible.  Any deviation from this dilutes its worth.  Knightly seems to have missed this critical point.<br /><br />Knightly also argues that the return investment in intelligence is not worthwhile.  He argues because of the need for secrecy, budgets are kept under wraps, and therefore are a bottomless pit of funding with little to support the expense.  This, too, is disingenuous.  Due to the very nature of espionage, results are secret - therefore it is very difficult to fairly and accurately determine the value of what has been \\"purchased\\" (unless through oversight groups such as the Senate Committee on Intelligence.)  Nevermind that it is not uncommon for an \\"investment\\" in intelligence to take years before it bears fruit.<br /><br />The author also cites failed operations as evidence of the uselessness of intelligence, and strongly criticizes the \\"mythology\\" of intelligence successes.  This, too, is unfair to the community.  Successes, by their very nature cannot be made public (lest they not be secret.)  That intelligence is \\"mythologised\\" is hardly surprising (given the precpetion in the mind of the public of what intelligence gathering is) - yet again, it is an unfair and unfounded accusation.<br /><br />Knighly does make some good points, and certainly there is much that intelligence agencies can be criticized for.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book.  As Snicket fans would expect, the book is full of his clever writing, witty remarks about adults (and their seemingly bizarre behaviour), and literary allusions.  This, more than the story itself, kept me engaged.  However, I hope some new plot device can be found to keep readers involved in the series - it IS morbid fun.	2005-06-18

Then along comes _The Hostile Hospital_, renewing my faith in the author and the series.<br /><br />WOW!  This is the best book since the second in the series.  There is a notably darker tone here, as the Baudelaire orphans are accused of murder, and are forced to hide out.  More tantalizing clues are left regarding not only the Beaudelaires, but also the mysterious Mr. Snicket himself.  Characters from previous novels reappear, tightening the \\"bigger picture\\" of the series.  As if this was not enough to pull readers back, there is a cliff-hanger ending.<br /><br />If you have been reading the series this far, your efforts for sticking with the Baudelaires will be richly rewarded with this installment.

Foul play befalls Klaus as Violet and Sunny work overtime (and undercover) to rescue him.<br /><br />The _Miserable Mill_ was over-the-top, but uproariously funny.  Not only were child - labor laws violated, but the orphans suffered splinters, casseroles, and coupons.

The story was entertaining, but not of the caliber of the previous Snicket books.  While I enjoyed having adults seen as thick and gullible (children can identify with this, for sure) and chuckled at the word play that is a characteristic of Snicket, the story itself wasn't as enjoyable or as captivating as the previous books.

That our Harry Flashman shows a more human side (being genuinely moved by the atrocities he \\"witnesses\\" by both sides) serves to add depth to the character.  As a previous review mentioned, in this book Flashman is much more influenced by events than an actor upon them.  In telling  of the Mutiny, it works extremely well.<br /><br />And finally, one also gets a feel for Fraser (through Flashman) as he writes, \\"you don't deserve it, you know ... not if its courage they're after .. but if they hand out medals for luck, and survival through funk, and suffering ignobly borne ... well, grab 'em with both hands\\" Written as by a true warrior, even if spoken through a scoundrel, poltroon, braggart and liar.	2005-06-14

Once again the skills of Violet and Klaus (and of course Sunny's teeth) come in handy as they foil Olaf's plots.<br /><br />Again, Snicket cleverly plays with words, inviting the reader to learn and enjoy language with him.

Tiefler talks about sex with humor and compassion, revealing much about how sex is viewed in contemporary society, what our views about sex have to say about us, and perhaps most interestingly (and provocatively) provides the reader with a new interpretation of sex, as she attempts to provide it in a social and psychological context rather than a merely biological one.<br /><br />The essays are not always accessable for the lay reader, as a number of Tiefler's writings are scientific in nature.  However her underlying assertion that sex and our attitudes and peceptions of it are constantly changing and and having meaning attatched to it was thought - provoking.

Frequently the narration of the book goes off on tangents that have no real place or bearing on the main story line.  This is no doubt distracting to some; I found these diversions conversational (in a \\"southern\\" sort of way) and added to the flavor and richness of the characters, which compensates for any frustration initially felt.<br /><br />What struck me the most was the underlying commentary Jones makes about the institution of slavery - essentially that it twists and malforms all who are touched by it, regardless of race, gender or place on the social heirarchy.

Michael Moore is a lightning rod for strong opinons, which do little justice regarding many of the reviews of his book.  This is unfortunate, as readers seek some information about the book's merits rather than a blanket criticism of the author's ideology.  With that said, I'll make as objective a review as possible.<br /><br />About the first 1/3 of the book is reminiscent of his \\"Farenheit 911\\", in which he takes the Bush administration to task for connections between Texas  oil and Saudi oil, the President's actions on the day of the attacks, and the exodus of Saudis from the US in the days following 9/11.  While his evidence is cited, many are from secondary sources which can be problematic.  What weight a reader will give them is entirely subjective.<br /><br />The remainder of the book has some very pointed (and humourous) criticisms of conservative policy in general, and several prominent Republicans and right-wing talk show hosts in particular.  Moore's presenation of facts and the framing of questions naturally puts these people in a negative light.  Fans of Moore will no doubt be tickled by this, just as those who strongly disagree with him will no doubt be insensed.  I found some of his points thoughtful (particularly the section about a \\"liberal paradise\\"), but much of it was a bit over the top for my taste.<br /><br />Certainly Michael Moore wants to evoke a reaction, and this book will no doubt succeed.	2005-04-26

It is frustrating that potential is wasted.  It is wonderful that women are beginning to receive the historical attention they deserve - however, flippant and downright silly historical abstracts like _Uppity Women_ do a disservice to women's history.<br /><br />I can forgive the broad take on when the middle ages took place, but struggled with the author's voice, which attempts at being humourous and \\"fresh\\" (often referring to women by nicknames created by the author.)  The book itself is entirely composed of one - two page summaries of the lives and \\"accomplishments\\" of women during the middle ages. That so little information is written about the women discussed is another disappointment.  More depth and less breadth would have made a much better read.<br /><br />The choice of women presented further detracts from the book. While many women who deserve recognition for real contributions are included such as washerwomen of the Crusades, Walladah - al Mustakfi and Sei Shonagon, there are many, many more women included who had no historical contribution whatsoever.  This inclusion seriously detracts from those women who did.  (Juana la Loca readily comes to mind.)  A final irritation were outright historical innacuracies - for example, claiming that Nicolo Machiavelli wrote _the Prince_ for Catherine d' Medici (in 1533) - simply inexcusable in a \\"history\\" book.<br /><br />A bright spot of _Uppity Women_ was its international flavor. While the vast majority of its subjects were European, women from the Near East, the Americas and Asia were also included.  I would recommend this book for middle schoolers, or perhaps (as an earlier reviewer noted) as bathroom reading.	2005-04-12

Frankfurt attempts to analyze what BS is, and more importantly, how it is fundamentally similar to and different from a lie.<br /><br />As philosophy goes, its pretty easy reading.  The analysis is easy to follow, and I tend to agree with many of his conclusions: among them, that we accept BS more readily (and with better humor) than a lie; that someone spreading BS is more concerned with him/herself than the truth, and that the production of BS is stimulated whenever a person speaks beyond their knowledge.<br /><br />Its a short, interesting read, and somewhat humorous (in a dry sort of way).

White brilliantly shows the the complexities of balancing Florida's ecosystem with necessary business development.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the lack of attention given to Ford as a character - instead much of the book was \\"Doc Ford as action hero\\" - I much prefered the introspection and internal conflict that had been shown in the previous few books.  But White is an excellent writer; his plot twists and action sequences made for great reading, and _Dead of Night_ is certainly among White's best work.	2005-04-06

Women in history have for too long been forgotten, and it was with this intent that I read this book.  I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Certainly the women disucssed in the book have earned recognition.  But the poor writing really got in the way of my enjoying the book. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there are historical inaccuracies.  What I had the greatest issue with was the switching from narrative dialogue to historical fact.  Throughout the book conversations and even thoughts of these women were written about that the author could not have possibly known.  For example, \\"The sudden click of the doornob interrupted her thoughts ...\\" (p. 33); \\"She heard the howls of a forlorn animal, a wolf she thought ...\\" (p 12) and so on.  If the book is a history, then it ought to be written as a history.  If it is fiction, then it should be written as fiction.  The fact that it was written as both, (given the historical \\"postscript\\" at the end of each chapter) did not settle well with me, and detracted from the overall worthiness of the book.<br /><br />Women certainly deserve to be recognized for their historical contributions.  It is unfortunate that the stories of the women presented here were not written in a manner more fitting their place in American history.	2005-04-04

As with other Flashman stories, there is much historical truth, liberally peppered with Fraser's witicisms and Flash's typcial bawdy and cowardly behaviour.  The story line draged a bit about 2/3 of the way through (I thought the diversion from the march to Peiking was a bit overdone), but true to form, Flashman finishes strong.  A very fun read.	2005-03-30

The plot was convoluted, made all the more difficult as the many loose ends are never tied up; many of the characters are, as a previous reviewer mentioned, a bit two-dimensional; and Dickens' social commentary of Victorian class inequities didn't strike a chord with me.<br /><br />While I can understand the potential of the novel, and appreciate the appeal of the author, _Edwin Drood_ is not a book I would recommend for those wanting to read some Dickens.	2005-03-30

Dr. Fletcher's _The Search for Nefertiti_ has much going for it.  The book begins with her telling of how she became an Egyptologist - interesting in its own right, if not directly related to the primary focus of the book.  She then goes into great detail about Egyptology itself, explaining how we know what we think we know about ancient Egypt and how frequently conclusions of earlier Egyptologists are wrong - and sometimes downright sexist as well.  This, too was interesting reading.  But Dr. Fletcher really hits her stride when she begins to discuss the 18th dynasty - the \\"Amarna Period.\\"<br /><br />The history of Egypt's New Kingdom is fascinating, as it was during this period of time that Egypt's power was at its zenith.  Dr. Fletcher does a marvelous job describing the era.  In particular, much detail is paid to Akhenaton and his wife, Nefertiti - the political climate, the religious changes that were taking place during his (their?) rule, and a glimpse at what is supposed regarding life at court. This is the strongest portion of the book, and had it ended here, I would have given it 4 stars.<br /><br />Yet Dr. Fletcher goes on to postulate that a mummy (previously described as \\"the Younger Woman\\") who dates from the 18th dynasty is that of Nefertiti.  Certainly this is plausable; but the evidence that is used to support Dr. Fletcher's claim is circumstantial and tenuous at best.  For this, I had to deduct a star.<br /><br />In the end, it provides a wealth of information about not only the field of Egyptology, but also the reign of Akhenaton and the 18th dynasty, and for this it is well worth attention.  Her conclusions regarding the \\"discovery\\" of Nefertiti, however, are wanting.	2005-03-22

This is interesting, and does serve to provide some context for the way in which the epidemic was responeded to, but largly was a bit out of place.<br /><br />The second third of the book is incredible in the thoroughness with which the subject is dealt with.  The nature of viruses in general is clearly explained, before influenza in particular is detailed - along with a very solid and easy to understand explaination of the way in which viruses (and influenza) can mutate.<br /><br />The disucssion of the epidemic in the United States is where Barry really hits his stride. As several readers have already remarked, he does have a tendency to get melodramatic, but his treatment of the proportions, reactions and the dramatic race to cure the epidemic are nothing short of riveting reading.<br /><br />The book is exhaustively researched, well written, and fascinating.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-02

As some reviewers have pointed out, his predictions are uncannily accurate.  However it is De Tocqueville's understanding of what America is - and isn't - was what struck me most powerfully.  Essentially De Tocqueville wanted to find out what made America \\"tick\\" and present an arguement as to why our democracy would not work in Europe.  (The author was a nobleman, mind you.)  His observations remain true to who Americans are, and serve as a reminder of who we hope to be.<br /><br />Among the uniquely \\"American\\" features De Tocqueville writes about are our society without rigid class lines - that each citizen understood himself to be the equal of all others; the nobility of work (or rather that work - and working hard - was not only expected, but looked forward to); the informality of address (and of dress).  The sense of social and economic opportunity that America provides through these attitudes, and the vast space and immense resources the country has that enables Americans to literally make (or re-make) themselves.  And perhaps most importantly, the seriousness with which Americans took their rights - most notable among them, the right to vote and run for public office.<br /><br />There are, of course, specific instances that remind the reader that these observations are over 150 years old - the carriage driver who nearly comes to blows with a German duke, or the graphic telling of the volumes of tobacco juice spraying passengers on a sternwheeler come to mind.  However it was refreshing to see that what it is to be \\"American\\" essentially has not changed since Jackson was President.	2005-01-10

In the fourth installment of the Flashman papers, our intrepid hero is in India, helping the Empire expand into the Punjab.  And yes, there are instances where Flashman does seem to demonstrate a little spine - but perhaps this is more a result of his working along side equally manipulative and underhanded schemers that Flash looks downright heroic in comparison.<br /><br />As Flashman fans would expect, the history behind the story is meticulously documented.  The tale is set a few years before the crown assumes control of the sub-continent from the East India Company, as India makes is greatest (but ultimately failed) attempt to drive the English out of the region by force. The history alone makes a fascinating read.  With the addition of Harry Flashman's escapades to \\"liven up\\" the byzantine plotting of real -life theives, turncoats, cowards and liars you have the best Flashman book to date.	2005-01-10

In exploring the complexities of the issues, Brown does not fall into the trap of villifying \\"the white man\\" while \\"enobling\\" the Natives - while sympathetic to the Natives, punches are not pulled regarding actions by either side.  The history is much more complicated than a littany of broken promises and broken treaties.  The stories of such varied peoples as the Navajo, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne and Sioux, Kiowa and Puna have similar features in the conflicts these nations had with whites; yet the inter-generational conflicts within tribes and the unique circumstances between the federal government and Natives are also explored in detail.  The only criticism I have is its lack of maps to give readers a clearer idea of the areas discussed in detail in the text of the book.<br /><br />_Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee_ is an outstanding history that addresses many misconcpetions Americans have about the settlement of the West, while also serving as a reminder of the unpleasant nature and the costs involved in \\"winning the West.\\"	2004-12-25

As the protagonist, Muersault is faced with what most would consider major life events: the death of his mother, the prospect of a job relocation to Paris, a woman asking him to marry her, murder and a trial he responds with a nonchalance that is disturbing, accepting the actions as part of life, and with the realization that there is very little he can do about them.  Yet the novella is also an exploration of the absurd, as Muersault's nonplussed reactions prompt absurd reactions from those around him.  Indeed, Muersault's choice to exist - to not attempt to influence or change any of the situations he finds himself in - is absurd.<br /><br />The book is both frustrating and insightful and was a worthwhile read.  It gives a much clearer understanding of existentialism than any essay of Sartre's, with an almost sarcastic undertone provided by the sheer absurdity of the plot.	2004-12-12

With each photo is a short (25 - 50 words) synopsis of the photo. This provides the bulk of the book, and  is its real strength.<br /><br />The book also includes a brief biography and time line of Riis' life, and an all too brief disucssion of his work as a social reformer.  While this is a good summary, I feel it could have gone into more detail regarding the time, the emerging role Riis (and others) played in social reform, and the impact he and other \\"muckrakers\\" had on America.  Nonetheless, a solid collection of pictures showing the barbaric and squalid conditions of the urban poor.	2004-12-12

The poetry portion of _Ahead of All Parting_ is dual language, so readers of German can enjoy the original as well as Mitchell's translations.  The book also contains copious notes about many of the poems (when they were written, what was going on in Rilke's life) as well as a section of his published and unpublished prose, which I found almost as vivid and beautiful as his poetry.  The book itself is also physically beautiful - the pages are delicate, further adding to the sensusousness of the reading experience.	2004-12-02

Responding to the corrospondence of a student of one of Rilke's former teachers, Rilke not only explains what it is to be a poet (\\"ask yourself in the most silent hour of the night: MUST I write? ... if you meet this solmn question with a strong, simple \\"I must,\\" then build your life in accordance with this necessity;\\") but what it is to exist and experience life in the modern world. (\\"Don't search for answers now, because you would not be able to live them .. the point is, to live everything.  LIVE the questions now.\\")<br /><br />The power of Rilke's words are in their truth, but also in the beauty of their sentiments.  This is one of my favorite books of all time for this reason, and I highly recommend it.	2004-11-26

Karl Rove and his ilk are not new in the political arena nor are the use of \\"dirty tricks\\" and \\"hard ball\\" tactics used by Rove in order to have politicians he represents elected.  \\"Bush's Brain\\" is a reminder of this.<br /><br />Moore does a comprehensive job of detailing the life and influence of Karl Rove - the right hand man to George W. Bush.  The material is shocking and reminiscent of the muckraking of the early 20th century. Like Turbell and Upton, it is difficult to read.  What was most disturbing is that both Republicans and Democrats employ tactics and \\"advisors\\" like Rove.<br /><br />Regading Karl Rove himself, the book presents much to dislike about the man and his alleged influence on George W. Bush.  Ironically, the book also highlights much to admire in his political adroitness. The fact that both are so well balanced is one of the book's strengths.  However, much of Rove's \\"influence\\" on the President is pooly supported.  Undoubtedly Rove has played a role in the decisions Bush has made - but the extent to which Rove played a role is speculative at best.  For that, I can only give it four stars.	2004-10-29

However, the interminable complaints - about \\"management\\" versus \\"worker\\", the press and foreign dignitaries visiting work sites (they are scenes of genocide, for crying out loud!), living conditions, and co-workers in general detracted from the book.	2004-10-29

The book is rich with scale diagrams of the fossil record of early hominids, presenting the various theories of human evolution from the mid-nineteenth century to the present.<br /><br />Because of the subject matter and the aim of the book, it is dense reading, and it clearly is not for everyone.

What remained with me, however, was the playfulness of the book.  Cervantes clearly was having fun with the character and his reader.  The humor and good-naturedness of the book was reinforced by the frequent translators notes, which I found helpful in pointing out \\"inside jokes\\" as well as in providing clarification.<br /><br />On another level, _Don Quixote_ is a masterpiece of social commentary, as Quixote parodys the mannerisms and airs of the aristocracy and learned, which was rapier-sharp satire.  The stories, adventures and misfortunes are too numerous to list; but it is a worthwhile read.	2004-08-23

I was not disappointed, and in fact, I believe _Murder on the Leviathan_ is the better of the two.<br /><br />Written from the perspectives of the various suspects, Erast more or less takes a \\"back seat\\" as the reader is led through the murder mystery on a ship bound for Calcutta out of France.  Each character provides their own perspective on the mystery, the suspects, and the clues - a very intriguing and clever device.  The cast of characters, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, are straight out of an Agatha Christie novel, but with the unique and humorous twist I have come to expect from Akunin.<br /><br />As the story plays out, we learn that each suspect has their own story to tell - more than a few of which are red herrings, but all are entertaining.

This was enjoyable to read.  Yet I can only give it four stars because of the cliched ending.  (No, the butler did not do it.)  Those who are avid mystery readers should be able to piece the plot together mid-way through the book - but will keep on reading out of the sheer joy of witnessing Fandorin work.	2004-08-02

Essentially, the old industrial elite of the last century - those who made their wealth as captains of industry (and their families) are being gradually replaced with what Brooks calls &quot;BoBo's&quot;: the Bohemian Bourgeoisie, with its own set of values and mores.<br /><br /> There is much to suggest that this is happening, and Brooks provides some excellent examples to support his position (&quot;eco-tourism,&quot; &quot;extreme-anything,&quot; and the rise of the &quot;Latte Village&quot; are the examples that hit closest to home.) But what struck me was the nature of this new elite.<br /><br /> Rather than parley industrial creation into wealth, BoBos become wealthy through their education, ideas and creativity - previously the realm of intellectuals rather than capitalists - the result of the new &quot;information age&quot;. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are examples of this. Like the bourgeoise of 200 years ago who replaced the landed aristocracy, Brooks argues, these new comers are replacing the &quot;old guard.&quot; And as happened 200 years ago, the new arrivals are replacing old cultural values with their own.<br /><br /> The book is a little slow to start (things don't get going until almost 50 pages into it), but the idea is an intriguing one - and it will give you pause to think as you climb into your SUV or order a half-caf, skinny, black and white mocha.	2004-07-21

It was brilliant.<br />But Steinbeck's writing was also brilliant - the imagery is vivid, the character descriptions real, and the events that unfold in the tiny, blue-collar town of Monterey are plausable.

Her experiences with her family, co-workers, relationships with the opposite sex are hilarious, only because they are so close to the experiences of our own.  Fielding has done a remarkable job of creating someone who is honest, frank, a bit goofy, and very likable.  An enjoyable, witty and very funny book.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-04

It is very comprehensive, and looks at women across time and around the world.  A fun - and fascinating - read.	2004-07-03
US	48135836	R2RBORH6VW0WXE	0399151818	340127390	Tampa Burn	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	the power of blood kinship	In Randy Wayne White's latest installment in the Doc Ford series, Doc's son is kidnapped by a psychopathic pyromaniac - Ford must rescue his son before harm is done.  As the story progresses, we learn a little more about the past of White's characters - Ford, Tomlinson, and Pilar, Ford's ex-lover and the mother of his son. Throughout the book the issue of &quot;family&quot; is visited and revisited, with all its various meanings and implications.  A great theme to tie the sub-plots together, and a brilliant way of providing more depth and detail to the characters. White's descriptions of the coast of southwest Florida give the reader a &quot;you are there&quot; feel to it, while keeping the story moving at a fast pace.<br />The only issue I had with an otherwise fantastic book was the way in which points would be made but the reader was given resolution only after hints and allusions.  While it was effective in keeping me riveted to the story, it was a bit frustrating as the issues were not directly related to the main plot line.<br />Nonetheless, a really enjoyable read, and the best Ford book since Ten Thousand Islands.  Randy Wayne White is certainly evolving into a first-rate writer, as _Tampa Burn_ demonstrates. Highly recommended.	2004-06-15

The story is set during the waning days of the Cold War, the Soviet Union struggling in Afghanistan as a former CIA officer takes the initiative to &quot;stick it&quot; to the Russians, while pursuing an agenda of his own.  This latter, parallel story line is what prevents this book from receiving 5 stars.<br />The internal politicking and maneuvering, the over-seas recriutment and &quot;dancing&quot; between intelligence officers, the operational strategizing are riveting and will certainly keep you turning pages.  Bearden's personal experience shines here, and for those who wish to get an idea of what the covert arm of the CIA does, it is an interesting glimpse of what &quot;human intelligence&quot; is about.<br />However the book's weakness is the contrived plot device of a relative who works for the KGB, and coincidentally is also working in Afghanistan.  I felt it detracted from the story rather than added to it, and saw it as an unnecessary distraction.  Perhaps it was included out of concerns of upsetting the CIA; maybe the author thought the story wasn't good enough without a &quot;family tie.&quot; Either way it didn't feel &quot;authentic&quot; and didn't quite fit.<br />However, _Black Tulip_ is a great read, certainly on par with the best of the spy-thriler authors, and better than most.  Recommended.	2004-06-08

However, the prequel to _The Da Vinci Code_ is a good book, with a decent plot and a story line that will keep your attention.<br />The story centers around the creation of &quot;anti-matter&quot; and its potential to be used as an energy source with a tremendous capacity to destroy as well.  A large quantity of anti-matter has been stolen, obstensibly by the ancient and secret order of the Illuminati, who seek to destroy the Vatican.  (Yes, the Catholic church again has a prominent role in this book as well.)  The search is on for the location of the anti-matter while the clock ticks away the seconds before its detonation.<br />As a story, _Angels and Demons_ has its merits: there is some plausability to it, and the landmarks around Rome are very much as Brown describes them.  The &quot;countdown to the end&quot; is a bit forced and contrived, and about 3/4 through the book a careful reader can figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is.  Nonetheless its an entertaining read.  Not nearly as good as _The Da Vinci Code_, but worthy of attention.	2004-05-26

And for me, it was the best part of the book - his descriptions of the city, its layout and familar haunts made me &quot;homesick.&quot;<br />The plot, on the otherhand, left much to be desired.  This may be a function of me reading the sequel without having read the previous story - there are allusions to events that happened &quot;earlier&quot;, but it didn't seem to make a huge difference to me.  Essentially the story deals with the resurgence of a 4th Reich in the newly re-united Germany, with plenty of intrigue, twists, and double-dealing characters.  Similar to a Le Carre or Ludlum book, but not nearly as well written or as tight.<br />The book would make for a decent airplane read, short of that, not recommended.	2004-05-11

The brilliance of the book is the way in which Daivs illustrates the juxtaposition and similarity between the two.<br />Davis takes you from the rainforests of Indonesia to the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, voudon practices in Haiti, toad licking in the Amercan southwest, &quot;surviving&quot; in the Canadian arctic.  In each essay, the tremendous variety of life (animal - including human - plant and fungal) and its adaptation to its environment is discussed in detail.<br />I give it four stars rather than five due to the underlying lament of the loss of bio (and cultural) diversity that is taking place worldwide.  Certainly this is a just concern, and Davis is not the first to draw attention to this.  However by only discussing the damage the modern, industrialized world is causing without addressing ways of elimintating the harm being done makes such observations a moot point.  Even with this criticism, however, I highly recommend this book.  It is a wonderful read.	2004-04-18

Certainly there are some fascinating tidbits included, and as the title suggests, the history of English speakers is revealed through its words.  But for non-linguists and historians, the book can be a bit tedious.<br />For those who are genuinely interested in language (and history, and the history of language) I recommend the OED.  For those with just a passing fancy (or those who do not want to invest in what a professor of lingustics refers to as &quot;the Holy of Holies&quot; - the OED), it is an interesting, if dry read.	2004-04-03

For example the settlement patterns and growing populations on the &quot;frontier&quot; (Appalachia and the Ohio river valley in the 1760's) and the role this played in the growing scism between the Americas and Britain.  The importance and legacy of the Northwest Ordinances in the settlement and&quot;opening&quot; of the continent.  The British conduct of the war and the specific challenges they faced in fighting Washington (and Arnold and Gates).<br />For its berevity, it is a remarkably dense and readable book.	2004-04-02

William Shakespeare reluctantly is drawn into the intrigue.  While the book moves at a lesiurely pace, the attention to historical detail (in terms of dress, customs, sanitation and social class) are remarkable which I enjoyed immensely.  The story improves as the plot thickens and the action increases, but as another reader pointed out, it takes a while to get there.<br />Taken at face value, it would be a great airplane read.  Historical purists may balk, and those looking for something with &quot;swashbuckling&quot; will be disappointed. A light, if entertaining, read.	2004-03-25

Larsen does a wonderful job of overlaping and weaving these two stories into a fascinating read.<br />The 1898 Chicago World's Fair was extravagant - it saw the first Ferris Wheel, the introduction of Cracker Jack, Shredded Wheat, and A/C electric lights.  Among those in attendance were Buffalo Bill Cody, Jane Addams, Susan B. Anthony, Samuel Clemens and a host of other notables of the age.  Along with such lumnaries was a hitherto unknown - H.H. Holmes, (one of serveral aliases) a serial killer.<br />The challenges and struggles the city of Chicago and its architects faced in creating and building the &quot;White City&quot; is paralleled to Holmes' construction of a castle of his own - a boarding house he used to murder his tenents.  As the fair begins, so do Holmes' grizzly crimes.<br />The story is true, making the read all the more riveting, the details of the fair fascinating. How the killings were pulled off without discovery for years, and how Holmes managed to commit other crimes without detection were also interesting.  The only flaw in the book is Larsen's re-creation of the murders themselves; no one knows for certain how many Holmes killed - he was convicted of six, but several others are possible, many more likely.  With that said, however, it is a wonderful book and I strongly recommend it.	2004-03-22

Duane does an admirable job of detaling the &quot;lifestyle&quot; of serious surfers, and gives some insight to what surfing is about - no easy task.  His writing is lucid and beautiful, romanticizing surfing while addressing the challenges of it.  The only critcism I have is Duane's attempt at &quot;de-mystifying&quot; surfing, an effort at which he ultimately fails; words literally defy the magic of water and air and the sensation you get while surfing.  Nonetheless its a great read.	2004-03-14

The book, in a word, is marvelous.<br />Some of the information is common sense (&quot;don't flash your cash&quot;), but much of it is extremely valuable - from carrying a &quot;drop&quot; wallet (with photos, a little cash and cancelled credit cards) to foil theives, to how to avoid landmines and what to do if approached by stoned, armed, pre-pubescent soldiers (as is too common in many parts of Africa.)<br />The first third of the book details how the rest of the world isn't as &quot;dangerous&quot; as one may be led to believe; the remainder is a veritable encyclopedia of information by country, including the political climate, (and major players and groups), diseases and other hazzards (like mines), and several valuable tips unique to each country.  Simply fabulous.<br />Of particular interest to those traveling in dangerous places are the addresses of American (and Canadian and British) embassies, good hotels (considering where you are ...), recommended prophalyxis before arriving, common diseases, and areas to be avoided.  The amount of information contained in this book is simply staggering.  I highly recommend it.	2004-03-09

The fact that the book deals with the Soviet Union's politics while the Soviet Union was extant is its greatest flaw - as such, it really has no purpose anymore.<br />However, mnay of the points and issues brought up and discussed remain relevant in the region - specifically the importance and influence of Islam in what was once &quot;Soviet central Asia&quot; (ie. Uzbekistan, Khazakhstan, Turkmenistan), and the inter-ethnic conflicts in the oil-rich Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia).  There are better books that deal with events more recently (Moscow's Muslim Challenge by Rykwin comes to mind).  For those seeking some historical perspective it has its worth, albiet limited worth.	2004-01-18

Naiive, groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood were easily subverted, repressed and generally thought of as harmless until the assassination of Anwar Sadat.<br />Citing the poverty, lack of opportunity and political repression as the fertile ground that created these groups, Kepel sympathetically goes on to discuss their agenda - essentially that &quot;secular&quot; &quot;nation-states&quot; are alien and counter to the history and culture of the Islamic world.

Essentially the argument is made that the repressive and secular Pahlavi regieme, ignoring and even actively repressing Islam caused a backlash that led to its eventual destruction.  At the same time, Keddie makes the point that the close ties the pre-revolutionary Iranian government had with the West, and its increasing reliance on it for support only served to increase the popularity of Islam as an alternative.<br />While radical Islam is a complex issue, and is broader than just the Iranian model, this book is a must for those who seek to understand the mass appeal of it.	2004-01-09

White then weaves his familiar brand of mystery, political commentary and action in a thrilling story.<br /><br />However Twelve Mile Limit is not White's best work.  I was disappointed by his inclusion of a manage a tois and the somewhat familiar \\"drug-dealers and white slavers\\" in South America theme.

This is glaringly apparent in the shocking mediocrity and generally poor quality of the stories.<br />The Barsukov Triangle, for example, is a rip-off of every book, script and story about the Beruda Triangle, with the exception that is it set in the Soviet Union.  Characters are all stereotypes of the &quot;ideal&quot; Soviet man (and woman), in an idealized USSR where the shelves are stocked, there are no ques, and everyone is happy to be working towards socialism in one country.  In other words, its bad.  Really bad.<br />However, I have to give it two stars precisely because it is such an excellent example of the literature that the Soviet Union produced for mass comsumption.

The in-fighting, back-stabbing, manipulation (and in some cases, outright treason, as in the case of Alexander Hamilton) between the emerging political parties are discussed in great detail as are the personalities of the &quot;founding fathers.&quot;<br />Wih this panoramic background Vidal has several points to make.  That the nation was have today is not at all what the creators of the Constitution would have imagined, that we Americans have surrendered many of the liberties given us by the founding fathers (to the courts and corporations), and that the &quot;democracy&quot; we imagine we have has, in fact, never been so.  I assume this is intended to provoke thought and reflection by readers, which it does.<br />But Vidal also has an ascerbic side, bordering on contempt for the common American when he asserts that most Americans have no idea what the &quot;electoral college&quot; is, that the nation has gravely erred by attempting to &quot;export&quot; democracy (beginning with our enterance into WWI and continuing to our current &quot;war on terror&quot;).  Vidal also bitterly (perhaps justly so) decries the relequeshing of Congressional power to declare war to the executive.<br />At the Constitutional Convention, an elderly Ben Franklin remarked that we have a democracy, if we can keep it.  Vidal argues that contrary to the intentions of our founding fathers, (who also battled similar issues) we have been unable to keep it.  Certainly a thought-provoking read, but it is sure to anger some.	2003-12-29

Among them are the arbitrary borders established by the colonial powers for their convience, with utter disregard for the indigenous people, their histories or past animosities.  (The result?  Violence in places like Rwanda, for example.) Rodney also points out that with the European conquest of Africa, the vast natural resources of the continent were - and still are being - plundered, from West African oil, to South African diamonds, to mineals like bauxite and copper on the interior.  With this in mind, the infrasructures the European created (roads, ports, cities, transportation and power grids) were designed exclusively for the removal of these resources in as quick and efficient manner as possible.<br />For me the most significant agrument Rodney made, however, was the political legacy of European colonialism - that Africans, after nearly 100 years of economic exploitation and political repression (they had no say in the political dealings of their homeland, mind you), the Europeans up and left with little preparation or training for the maitainance of the economic and political infrastructure.  No wonder there is so much political unrest, economic uncertainty, wide spread poverty and disease.<br />I give it 4 stars because of the strength and obvilious passion Rodney had for his subject matter, and for making an excellent argument.  I cannot give it 5, however, because the book is not without its flaws.  For example, the Africans are not held accountable for THEIR role in the continuing underdevelopment of the continent - Africa remains tremendously rich in resources; only now are the Africans beginning to manage and control the export of these to their advantage.

Each story takes literally only minutes to read (they're an average 6 - 12 pages long), but they are brilliant in plot and character development, each with an unexpected twist of some sort at the end, and each different from the other.<br />The stories are set in New York City at the dawn of the 20th century, so there is much that is slighly unfamiliar, especially some of the language (who knows what a &quot;masher&quot; is, anyway?).  This aside, I found myself laughing out loud more than once, and frequently shaking my head at the entertaining and masterful way in which each story unfolded.  A recommended read.	2003-12-24

The older pythons help nurse him back to health, while Verdi learns that once they, too were young and wild like he was.<br />The book is marvelous.  It is extremely readable for young (3 - 6) year olds, and the art work is beautiful, with vivid colors and expressive characters (even for a snake!).  Best of all, the story line is appropriate, with a message that is easily understood (be yourself; we were all young once) without being preachy.  A wonderful children's book.	2003-12-22

Artists, movements, vocabulary, and specific works of art are all discussed in enough detail to give the reader a very good foundation.  The only thing lacking is that it is oriented exclusively towards Western art.

The story of his life reads like fiction, although it is all true: escaping a palace revolt as a child, learning several trades in order to better understand the work, traveling abroad, building a new capital for the Russian empire, modernizing the Russian army, streamlining the Russian beauracracy, expanding the Russian empire's borders, &quot;westernizing&quot; Russia.<br />This laundry list of accopmplishments and changes are highlighted by Massies lucid and vivid writing, making Peter a flesh and blood ruler - a person with passion and temper, intelligence and a sense of humor.

Alan Palmer provides a good, if broad overview of the possible causes of the Muslim empire's death by a thousand cuts and the reasons why it took so long for it to finally dissolve.  However, I found it lacking.<br />Palmer does an adequate job of outlining the major politcal reasons given for the decline.  And for those seeking a an introduction into the last half of the Ottoman empire, this would be a good book to begin with.  However, there is much that Palmer does not explore that merits some attention, even in a general history such as this.<br />For example, very little is mentioned of the Tanzimat Reforms, an attempt in the early 19th century by the Turks to modernize and industrialize along the lines of Europe after the Enlightenment.  Similarly, Palmer would have been better served to disucss the role that the &quot;Great Powers&quot; of Europe played in simultaneously propping the Ottoman Empire up (as a balwark against the Russians) while assisting in tearing it down (by supporting the emergence of Balkan nation states.) to a greater degree.<br />I enjoyed _The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire_, but it did not do the subject matter justice.	2003-12-11

Leo Litwak's recollections of his service in WWII as a combat medic is not what I had expected.  I had anticipated a memoir - instead the book is essentially a collection of vignettes and impressions the author had during his service in Europe in the final year of the war.  Litwak admits in his foreward that unit names and places had been changed, and that some individuals mentioned in the book were composites of personalities he knew.  I appreciated his honesty.<br />After reading the book, I also appreciated his honesty in presenting his perspective on the war.  The graft and looting by \\"our boys.\\"  The whoring around.  The detached neutrality of working on the wounded, and the non-chalance of seeing so much death so often.  Not everyone who served in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) saw combat; and not everyone who saw combat in the ETO was there from the Normandy landing to V-E day.  Litwak was honest about his service, his experiences, and his impressions.<br />As a combat medic from a later war, I had anticipated experiences and recollections similar to my own. While we had some experiences in common, we had many more differences as we served in two very different times.  Nonetheless, the honesty with which Litwak writes of his time in Europe is not a romanticized or sanitized version of WWII. And aside from the obvilious shortcomings of his composites, it is real at an emotional (if not strictly historical) level.	2003-12-08

However, the betrayal of ideology, mass murder and abuses by Stalin in the name of socialism prompted Orwell to write _1984_: a brilliant satire and a classic of 20th century literature.<br />In the future, there is the one state, ruled by &quot;Big Brother&quot;, an allegedly benevolent ruler who is rather sinister.  Obedience is demanded, subjects are not even allowed the freedom of thought.  All labor and effort is geared towards the &quot;greater good&quot;, in a totally egalitarian society that is as stifling as it is sterile.<br />Written as a criticism of Stalinism and the Soviet system, its biting criticism is testament to the extremes of ideology. While it is an easier read than the earlier Soviet work by Eugene Zamiatin's _We_, I feel _We_ is the better book.  Nonetheless, 1984 is worthy of a reading.	2003-12-03

First, the very fact that the book discusses &quot;the Soviet Union&quot; did much to jade my opinion of the book.  However, upon a closer reading, the strengths of the text become apparent.<br />While Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan are all independent nations, the issues and problems this region faced (and continues to face) are discussed - the role if Islam versus secularism, the influence of &quot;radical Islam&quot;, women's issues, natural resources - all still are vital to an understanding of the region and its geopolitical importance today.<br />While much has changed in the region since the books first publication, much of the author's analysis and conclusions still have relevance to the contemporary reader.	2003-11-29

As such, his _Pity of War_ is a new interpretation of one of the seminal events in the last 150 years.  Rather than a formal &quot;history&quot; of the First World War, it is more of a collection of essays and papers on his take on the conflict.  While his arguments are interesting, I am skeptical of many of his conclusions, and find some of his arguments bewlidering.<br />Ferguson claims, for example, that Britain should have left Belgium out to dry, which would have ended the war with a unified Europe and Britain's Empire in tact.  While I would argree that WWI destroyed the British Empire, it is a little disingenuous to claim that Germany would have &quot;unified&quot; Europe.  Other arguments claim that it was not propoganda, but the &quot;thrill of the fight&quot; that kept the war going on for so long, that Germany was not militaristic, and that the Versailles Treaty was not harsh enough.<br />Much of Ferguson's book flies in the face of the conventional wisdom on the First World War - and to be fair, some of his ideas do warrant further attention; however the bulk of the book seemed a far reach to the plausable.	2003-11-29

Wiesel has the uncanny ability to recreate the unimaginable daily genocide so that the reader is placed in his shoes, seeing the carnage through his eyes.  The book is written at a very accessable level, and given the gravity of the subject matter is very short.  However its impact is similar to that of being punched in the solarplexis.

Masterful writing and detailed analysis as in his _Six Armies at Normandy_ is one example of why he is so highly regarded in the field.  Keegan examines the military build up prior to the invasion, but spends much of the book discussing the British and Canadian landings, with less attention to Utah (and much less attention to Omaha) beaches.  Of particular interest was his discussion of the Polish brigades in the battle, which I had previously never heard of, and his excellent treatment of the Falaise Gap.<br />The only criticism I have is that it is a military history - and as such, is written in a style that may be off-putting to some.  Furthermore, it is much more detailed than many books on the Second World War, which is both a boon and a burden - for those who are interested in the minutiae of the Normandy landings and the immeadiate aftermath, I cannot recommend another book more highly.

Barson makes no judgements on the attitudes and behaviours of the time, which is a strength of the book, and serves to underline the silliness that possessed many Americans.

It is the story of a son, returning from college with a fellow student, and his father.  It is also about the generation gap that exists within the family, the dynacmic of college friends, the marvelous magic of youth, and the strength of familial ties.<br />I first read this in college, but, like good wine, the story has imporved with age.  As I have gained experience and wisdom with years, so has my appreciation of the brilliance and wisdom of Turgenev's observations.  All too often we think of ourselves as the first to see or experience things - from love, to ideas, to the exuberance and idealism that being young is all about.  Turgenev shows us the folly in that line of thinking.  And in so doing, gives us a glimpse of the universality of what it is to be human.  _Fathers and Sons_ ranks as one of my favorite books for this reason.  After a reading, I am sure you will agree.	2003-11-08

However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy.  The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.<br /><br />While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics.

The brutality, inhumanity, and gruesome daily life in the hell-on-earth that was the Holocaust is matter-of-factly, even non-chalantly described and recounted in _This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen_.  Little wonder the author put his own head in a gas oven in the years following his experiences.  The images are haunting.  But what I found to be most disturbing was the simple language Borowski used in retelling his experiences.<br />Borowski, a Pole, lived separately from the Jews who were daily incenerated.  And while his life was unimaginably difficult, by some measure it was better than that of the Jews.  A sense of guilt - call it survivors guilt, or regret, or perhaps at its most elemental level, deep and profound sadness - permeates the book, as it should.  It is a remarkable read, profound and stunning.  Highly recommended.	2003-11-08

The humor is subtle, the satire biting, the social criticism of Austro-Hungarian class structure dead on.

It provides an outstanding overview of the complex and labor intensive work of survival during this period of time.  However, I found it a bit narrow in terms of the time period it covered.  The &quot;middle ages&quot; last over 1000 years - from around 500 AD (the &quot;early middle ages&quot;) to the &quot;late middle ages&quot; (ending around 1450).  In the course of such a long period of time, even in the middle ages, tasks, roles and habits change.

Far from presenting arguments &quot;for&quot; and &quot;against&quot; Marxism (in spite of the title), the book defines what Marxism is as an economic and social philosophy as well as what it is not.  (Note that politics is is absent in his exploration - this is no accident, as Heilbroner explains.)  Often misunderstood (and still more frequently mis-applied), the essence of Marx's theories are deconstructed - from the theory of surplus value of labor, to dialectical materialism, to Marx's belief in the enevitability of socialism's triumph over capitalism, Heilbroner takes the reader through an easily understandable and readable summary of Marxism.<br />Regardless of your political or social stripe, Karl Marx and his view of the world have had (and continue to have) a dramatic impact on the way things are seen and thought about, its influence reaching far beyond economics.  Heilbroner does an excellent job in de-mystifying a very dense subject.	2003-10-23

However, there are some shortcommings - the chief among them are the maps.  While they are useful in giving the reader an idea of what happened where, they really needed to be more detailed, showing troop movements and positions.  I also thought the lack of perspective on the war was disappointing - after all, the Franco-Prussian war was instrumental in the creation of German nationhood, the birth of the Fourth republic, and a foundation stone of the First World War.  None of these important after-effects were discussed in any detail whatsoever.  As a book of pure military history, though, Howard's book is beyond reproach.	2003-09-28

All true, and these points are well argued and well presented.<br />However, there is one glaring fact that is not addressed: that all of these wonderful things built and brought to Africa and Asia (at European expense) were created FOR the Europeans, and were designed with the intent of suiting the needs and wants of the European powers - roads, canals and ports, for example, were built exclusively for the extraction of raw materials in the quickest and most expedient manner possible - without thought or concern for the indigenous people.  The same is true with the hospitals, schools and universities, civil service, and other social and political institutions.<br />While admitedly this book is an &quot;apology&quot; for European imperialism, it is nonetheless a marvelous read, its point of view well argued.  In the end, however, its agruments are unconvincing.	2003-09-28

His observations, thoughts and eyewitness accounts of the &quot;change&quot; are contained in his _Berlin Journal_.  It is tepid at best.<br />My primary issue is with Darnton in the role of &quot;historian&quot; as journalist - neither should meddle in the affairs of the other.  I also have issues with his lack of perspective and understanding of comtemporary German culture, politics and society.  This lack of understanding is a major obstacle in putting the events in their proper perspective.  Furthermore, very little attention is given to the slow groundswell of anti-Communist sentiment and the frequency of demonstrations in cities other than Berlin and Leipzig - like Chemnitz (aka &quot;Karl-Marx Stadt&quot; in DDR times), Schwerein and Rostock.  Darnton also misses the importance of the &quot;middle classes&quot; and &quot;middle aged&quot; in making the &quot;revolution&quot; happen (it certainly would have failed were it only a &quot;youth movement.&quot;)<br />While it is an interesting read of a magical time, it really lacks the depth and perspective a better informed witness could have brought the book.	2003-09-27

It is a humourous read, if for no other reason than to revel in the wit (and witicisms) of one of the revolutionary generation's great minds.<br />While several articles are funny (&quot;How to Choose a Mistress&quot; is also a favorite), many miss the mark - humor has changed a bit over the last 200 - odd years.  Nonetheless, I recommed the book for no other reason than to give our founding fathers a more &quot;human&quot; face.	2003-09-27

A case could even be made that Wahabism is a strand of fundamentalism in the broader interpretation of the word.  Sivan examines Islam's fundamentalist appeal in Egypt (with the &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, the group responsible for the murder of Sadat), Islamic Jihad in Lebanon and Syria, and the briefly touches on the shi'i revolution in Iran.  At the heart of each of these groups is a disaffection with the Middle East's place in the world economy, and the political notion of a &quot;nation-state.&quot;  The appeal of fundamentalism is explored, and a good introduction to the interpretations of the Qu'ran that fundamentalists find is also discussed.<br />However, the book is not without its shortcomings.  As a reader mentioned earlier, there is a Sunni slant to the fundamentalist movement (Shi'ii's are scarcely mentioned at all, and when they are are put in a 'negative' light), and Wahahbism - perhaps the first &quot;fundamentalist&quot; movement within Islam is ignored entirely.  Furthermore, I had hoped that some discussion would have taken place regarding &quot;where do we go from here?&quot;  Needless to say the issues that give fundamentalist (or even &quot;radical&quot;) groups their appeal have not changed, so the continued existence of these groups is a foregone conclusion.<br />It is a good introduction to the &quot;radical&quot; movement, but is hardly the final word or greatest authority on the topic.	2003-09-21

And no doubt, like many, was tepid about it - the book was ok, but nothing to get excited about.  Years later, with the benefit of some living, however, I have an entirely new appreciation for it.  Like good wine, the story improved with age.<br />The story is a vivid description of the pre-civil rights south, with its rigid racial divisions and class structure.  The plot revolves around the alleged rape of a white girl by a black man and the trial that takes place.  Naturally the prejustices and social mores play an important part in the tale - as do the lessons Harper Lee has to teach about growing up and the injustices that life has.<br />It is an American classic and Pulitzer Prize winner - but I think for most readers just entering adulthood, the beauty and honesty of the book is lost for a lack of years.  Read it again, years later and enjoy a whole other (more subtle) novel.	2003-09-18

Sinclair's _The Jungle_ is best known for its graphic and grisly details of the meat packing industry and the hazzards its products presented the public.  This is all true, and those who are interested in looking for these descriptions will not be disappointed in the original edition of the book.  However, there is another side to the story, one that is frequently overlooked:  the social cost of industrialization, and the de-humanization of the labor force.<br />Equally horrifying to the processing of the food is the abominable working conditions and maladies those who worked in the packinghouses suffered - from those who de-boned shanks (with thier stubs of a thumb), to the workers who removed the hides from the caracasses (their hands all but eaten away from the chemicals they worked in) - and the list goes on and on ... not to mention the daily struggles the immigrants faced, at constant risk of being swindled or abused.<br />Sinclair was a socialist, and his political leanings are apparent in his classic book - yet this does not detract from the story; in fact, I would argue it only strengthens the force of his words.  It is a marvelous read, but you'll never look at a hotdog the same again.	2003-09-16

Remarque, like the Englishman Wilfred Owens, shows the old lie for what it is - that there is nothing noble or good in death, even for one's country.<br />It is a powerful book, simply and elegantly written.  I highly recommend it.	2003-09-16

However, I got more out of the book as a journalistic venture discussing the mistakes and horrors of &quot;the seige&quot; than I would have from reading a history on it per se.<br />Salisbury does a remarkable job of humanizing a mythic and seminal event in the history of the USSR in all its grisly detail.  Much has been made of the 900 days Leningraders suffered, earning it the accolade of &quot;Hero City&quot; by Stalin for its will to survive.  Salisbury writes of the experience in a manner that allows the reader to empathize with the citizenry of Leningrad - something a historian would never do; however it is precisely this element that makes it such a remarkable book.	2003-09-15

Instead, I found an engaging and well written book that disucsses the legacy of that ancient religion on Judiaism, Christianity and Islam.  I also discovered quite a bit about pre-Islamic Persia.<br />Kriwaczek does a masterful job of detalining the shadows of Zarathustra's teachings in the present, and the tremendous debt world civilization owes to Zoroastrianism as a belief system:  for example, the concept of \\"good\\" vs. \\"evil\\" in a cosmic battle for universal supremacy; or the idea of a paradise in the \\"hereafter\\";  even angels and demons are remnants of the old Persian religion.

Most of the sources are short - no more than 6 pages in length, which lends itself well to &quot;reading on the go.&quot;  As a reviewer has earlier pointed out, women of all social strata are represented here, which is also a strength.  However, I was dismayed by the fact that the vast majority of the selections are by whites - African - Americans, Asian - Americans, Native Americans and other groups are not well represented at all, which detracted from the book's merit as &quot;the Female Experience.&quot;  In spite of this minor point, it is fascinating reading.	2003-09-07

Guy Sajer's memoir vividly captures the raw horror, pain and waste that is war.  It is ironic that Sajer writes from the perspective of a nazi soldier - the \\"bad guys\\" in WWII.  This makes his stories all the more compelling, reminding us that war IS hell - regardless of which side of the battle lines you fight on.<br />I give it 4 stars for its relative lack of scope - I had a difficult time figuring out where Sajer was while he was relating his story.  (I know, from personal experience, most soldiers on the front line lack the \\"vision\\" of thier role in the bigger picture - but I had hoped that after the fact, as the book was being written, those areas would be filled in.)  In spite of this minor criticism, it truly is a remarkable account of the second world war, and of what life was like on the eastern front in particular.	2003-09-07

While much of what Machiavelli has to say may seem &quot;underhanded&quot; or even &quot;immoral&quot;, this book has been the manual for many who were successful in reaching their political goals - one might even say (in true Machiavellian fashion) that morals have no place in politics...<br />Regardless of one's feelings about the messages of the book, it is an excellent commentary on the human condition, on politics, and especially on those who practice the art.

However, it has very little from the voices that proceeded the mass exodus of nations from the Soviet bloc - and for this reason I can only give it 3 stars.<br />To be fair, to go too far back would be out of the scope of the book.  However, I am surprised at the lack of materials written by such well known dissidents as Vaclav Havel in the early 1980's, or even materials from the Solidarity strike in Poland.  More recent events such as Hungary's graudal &quot;warming&quot; to the west (as &quot;many roads to socialism&quot; were advocated) would have also been appropriate.  Nonetheless, it is a comprehensive look at a watershed year in history.	2003-09-07

There are the ubiquitous documents and accounts of the Progressivism and the suffrage movement, the impact of the Great Depression and World War Two on the home, and the \\"birth\\" of feminism in the late 1950s and 1960s, through to material on the sexual revolution of the 80s.  Frankly, I was a bit diasppointed.<br /><br />As a history teacher, I am regularly appalled at the relative lack of attention that women in history are given.  If one were to judge by the materials in this book, women have not had much influence in America.  Obviously this is not the case, hence my rating.  Furthermore, women of color are not well represented, nor are the experiences of immigrants, rural women, and similar groups.  Ware's anthology is primarily comprised of the experiences of white, urban women.  A strength of the book are its 3  \\"photo essays\\", depicting the obstacles women faced in the workplace, at home, and in education.<br /><br />In my opinion, better books on the subject are Rosalyn Baxandall's _America's Working Women_  and Gerda Lerner's _The Female Experience_.	2003-08-31

There is census data from Spanish California, accounts of Iroquois women in government, oral histories of slaves (and mistresses), and some really fabulous material on the 19th century sufferage movement.  The voices of women from all social classes can be heard here, from the colonial era to the Progressive period.  It is very well rounded, and I will certainly be including it as a part of my curriculum.<br />The only short-coming I find in the book is its lack of statistical and visual documents.

A friend of Sigfried Sasson and Wilfred Owens, Graves, in my opinion, is the better writer of the lot.  His writing is so lucid, we feel the impulsiveness as he enlists (and receives a comission, as was his due to his place in Edwardian society), and we also gradually come to understand the pointlessness of the carnage and the horrors of the war.<br />The book is at its most moving, however, as Graves re-tells of his leave back to England - the comparisons to Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front are erie - I was particularly moved by part where Graves remembers the family of a deceased friend he was visiting, the mother pacing the house at all hours of the night ... it really made the human costs of the war feel suddenly very personal.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, it is an excellent memoir of the war, and in my opinion, the best first - hand account of the war in the west.	2003-08-30

Like another reviewer, I wonder if the polarization of ratings and the invectives used by readers have less to do with the merits of the book then with the own beliefs of the reviewers.  No matter where your religious beliefs fall, you must admit, Rev. Spong does make some compelling - and controversial - arguments.  But look at the title!  The Rev. is not writing for fundamentalists (ie. those who take a literalist interpretation of the Bible) but for those readers who live in the secular and scientific age and have difficulty reconciling science with Biblical Christianity.<br />The book is a collection of essays on the nature of Jesus and the message of Christianity.  It seems to me that it is the latter that causes the most conflict rather than the latter.  It is my understanding that to be considered a \\"Christian\\" one must believe in the divinity of Jesus (that Jesus of Nazareth was God as man.)  Spong seems to deny this, (which is puzzling to me as well as to others) yet agrues that the issue of Jesus' divinity is not what is central to Christianity - rather it is the message of Christ that is important.  I found this argument compelling and fascinating.<br />Certainly there is much in the Bible that flies in the face of fact and science - ignoring this is what makes one a \\"fundamentalist.\\"  Spong argues that one need not take every word of the Bible literally, but rather one should step back and look at the message, lessons and morality that the Bible (and Jesus) articulate, without getting caught up in semantics.  Yet it is precisely these points that are causing such a sharp division of opinion about Rev. Spong's book.<br />While it is understandable that many feel threatened and angry about Spong's essays, they do have their merit whatever your personal religious beliefs.  A fascinating (and well presented) argument.	2003-08-18

At the root of the book is the important question of determing time since death - critical in the correct prosection of murder crimes.<br /><br /> I found the details fascinating of how forensic scientists (entomologists, anthropologists and even microbiologists) are learning more about the decompostion, dessication and eventual disintegration of human bodies.  I was similarly riveted to the numerous stories of how the science was evolving and gradually coming into use in the courtroom.<br />The book is certainly not for everyone, and be prepared for the odd sideways glances from those who see you reading it.  But it is a guilty pleasure (pardon the pun) for those who have the guts (sorry, had to do it) to read it through.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-13

To its credit, it was exhaustive in its approach to the subject matter, beginning with the geographical layout of the Pelopnnesus and its subsequent political development in the distant past prior to the war.  And the causes of the war were certainly discussed objectively.  But the book was dry - really dry.  The sort of thing that college students, in their worst nightmares, have of what a history class is like dry.  With all due respect to Thucydides, it read like a monontone lecture.<br />Is there valuable information here?  Absolutely.  Is it a landmark piece of history?  Without doubt.  But we have (thankfully) come a long way from the monotonous drone in history writing since the 4th century BC.  In other words, its important, but a very tough read.	2003-08-13

The fact that a conscript was literate is in itself remarkable - even more so when you judge the book's command of language (maybe with a little &quot;help&quot; from the editor.)  But the book, as short as it is, is not for everyone.  I would recommend it to those who are familiar with the Napoleonic campaigns, military historians, or those (like myself) who enjoy memoirs.  The brutality and senslessness of the combat, and especially his account of the retreat out of Russia are fabulous.  Less so the rest of the book, especially the letters at the end.	2003-08-06

Yes, Darwin is still being scrutinized, and not just by the religious set.I found the book a bit dry and difficult to keep my attention.  Far too little is discussed about the thinkers before Darwin, and too much is spent on the scientific debate the 50 years after Origins was published.  I would have preferred Mayr exploring the implications and impact of the discovery of DNA and microbiology on modifications of natural selection, specicies variation and adaptation instead.  Therefore I can only give it 4 stars.  In my opinion, a far better book on a related subject is Loren Eisley's Darwin's Century.	2003-08-01

As one reader pointed out, Brinton never defines what a &quot;revolution&quot; is - a problem especially given the fact that many do not consider the American Revolution a revolution at all.  But beyond this point, there are problems as well.  His model does not fit each revolution very well - especially the English Revolution's &quot;Thermidorian Reaction&quot; (which Brinton uses to describe the &quot;calm&quot; after the relative chaos and violence one usually associates with revolution.)  His argument on the origins of revolution is similarly does not fit all revolutions well.<br />However, it is a fascinating read, and Brinton does a remarkable job in briefly and succinctly summarizing each revolution, their causes and the major players and events in them.  This, if for no other reason makes it a worthwhile read.	2003-07-30

With that said, I was absolutely floored by _Anger_.  I have never had a book &quot;speak&quot; to me the way Thich Nhat Hanh's wonderful (and readable) book does.<br />The book is neither preachy nor self-depreciating.  Rather, in an almost conversational tone, Hanh discusses the nature of anger and how it effects us and those around us.  Hanh then goes on with gentle advice on how to address anger - between spouses, family members, even nations.<br />Naturally the book is couched in Buddhist terms, but this does not detract from the central message of the author or limit the  effectiveness of its message.  In fact, one could insert what ever spiritual tradition you choose in place of &quot;the Buddha&quot; (or remove it entirely if you wish) and still get the benefits of the practice Hanh is encouraging.<br />I highly recommend the book.  It is easy to read, practical, and very down to earth, with solid, user-friendly advice for everyone touched by anger (as a recipient of anger as well as one who feels angry.)  A great read.	2003-07-30

I had always assumed that Dawin's _Origin of Species_ and _Decent of Man_ were discoveries made by a brilliant flash of intuition and genius.  Eisley clarifies this misconception, demonstrating the ideas and theories that influenced Darwin - from Buffon and Lamarck to Malthus and Linneaus were critical in the development of his theory.  Of course, all of these naturalists were &quot;close&quot; to evolution, but it was Darwin who managed to connect the dots, and it was Darwin's genius that made sense of it all.  However, the theories of natural selection, species variation and adaptation did not occur in an academic vacuum.  Eisely does a great job of showing this.<br />The only criticism I have is that it is written more for the &quot;scholarly set&quot; - maybe as a supplementary text for a college class rather than for the general public.  This is not a weakness, but certainly something the lay reader should be aware of going into this remarkable book.	2003-07-30

Marcinko's account of his Naval career with &quot;the Teams&quot; certainly qualifies him as a genuine American hero.  From Pennsylvania miner, to BUD/S training, to his active service and eventual creation (and command) of SEAL Team 6, Rogue Warrior is a true story that reads like fiction.  Marcinko details some of his operational information, which is probably not enough for some, but provides an idea of what a SEAL does.<br />What I found more interesting was his relationship with the Navy in general, and his superiors in particular.  For anyone who has served in the military, it is readily apparent that Marcinko ruffled feathers and stepped on toes.  While the CDR. (perhaps justifiably) feels his actions were necessary, it is evident that his circumscription of proceedure and detail eventually hurt his career.  The bitterness and anger he (rightly) feels is apparent and, it seemed to me, part of the reason behind his book.  While interesting, I thought it detracted from the &quot;story&quot;, which is why I can only give it 3 stars.  Nonetheless, for old and armchair warriors alike, there is much to appreciate from Marcinko's exploits.	2003-07-27

Rowling has outdone herself yet again in The Order of the Phoenix.  Yes, Harry is frequently angry, sometimes a bit of a snot, and even disagreeable - but Harry is also 15.  Reading the experiences of Harry vividly brought back memories of my own adolescence (and how uncomfortable and generally painful the experience was.)  Bravo for her her honesty as she lets young Potter \\"grow up\\" facing troubles typical of a 15 year old - teachers who are unfair, the challenges of figuring out the oppsite sex, alienation and frustration with adults, and impatience with friends.  Of course, there are also other things bothering our young hero ...<br />The story involves the increasing frequency with which Harry's scar hurts, his troubling dreams (from the perspective of \\"You-Know-Who\\") and, as if this was not enough, the fact that he is living under the microscope of the press.<br />As many other reviewers have said, the book reads quickly, in spite of its size.

I say least understood, because Darwin advances several theories (all relating to) evolution.  It is a fascinating read, and a marvelous experience to &quot;peek&quot; into the mind of a genius.<br />First, Darwin's theories are about natural selection, adaptation, extinction, species variation, and significantly, a common ancestor - all of which are a part of the bigger picture, that all life has evolved and is continuing to evolve.  His evidence is overwhelming (it had to be in order to advance such radical ideas) and, for lack of a better word, brilliant.<br />Much has been made about religion and evolution - which is why I mentioned that his theories are not well understood.  At no point is God (or a Supreme Being, or whatever you want to call it) mentioned, let alone removed from Darwin's theory (regardless of how you feel about the matter.)  Yet it is these theories that have laid the ground work for entire disciplines of science, and which has revolutionized science as a whole.<br />With that said, the book tends to beat the points to death a bit.  (Again, understandable given the magnitude of the ideas), but the lay reader can get a good flavor of the arguments, and the evidence about a third of the way through.  Its interesting, to be sure, but a bit dry, which is why I can only give it 4 stars.	2003-07-24

The plot revolves around Gregor, who has the misfortune to wake up one day as a human-sized insect (cockroach?  beetle? Kafka isn;t clear.)  The nightmare begins as Gregor and his family &quot;deal&quot; with his predicament, each responding in a different way.<br />The story is surprisingly short - the majority of the book deals with various interpretations about &quot;what it all means&quot; and what Kafka was trying to say.  To be honest, I was less interested in these deconstructions as I was in thinking about it on my own - I'd like to think Kafka would have wanted it that way - much as Gregor and his family struggled with the situation individually.  A bizzare, nightmarish story, but like a car accident, its difficult to look away.	2003-07-21

The book begins with a primer on insect anatomy before broadly covering the taxonomy of the major insect orders of beatles, wasps (including bees and ants) termites (including dragonflies and mayflies), butterflies, moths, fleas (and flies), grasshoppers (and crickets), stick insects (including mantises and cockroaches), and spiders.<br />There is little specific information about each species, but plenty of general information about the order, and enough detail to give the lay reader (such as myself) a good &quot;feel&quot; for the critters.  However, the diagrams and plates of the insects are what drew me to the book.<br />Many of the pictures are from Victorian era prints, some are more recent etchings, but all are remarkable and beautiful in their own right.  (I know, who would have thought of &quot;bugs&quot; as beautiful?)  It really is an interesting read, with an excellent biliography for further reading if a specific order or genus strikes your fancy; but the depiction of theses small animals is what makes this book such a treasure.	2003-07-19

I've had little experience with graphic novels, but this piqued my interest - 4 legends of 19th century literature brought together to combat another legendary villian of the same era.  I am not ashamed to admit I love it!<br />The characters themeselves are all true to their 19th century personas - Willhelmina (Mina) Harker (of Dracula), Allan Quartermain (of the Lost City of Gold), Captain Nemo (the Asian Indian intended by Verne), H.G. Wells' Invisible Man, and of course Dr. Jekyll - each with their foibles (Quartermain is an opimum addict, Jekyll a hopeless coward, the Invisible Man a letch ...) which makes them all the more real.<br />I was impressed with the artwork - the detail was remarkable, which oftentimes caught my attention more than the story line (which also is quite good.)  But what really cinched it for me was the little literary tidbits sprinkled throughout - for example, there are references to James Fennimore Cooper's &quot;Hawkeye&quot;  (aka &quot;Natty Bumpo&quot;), Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist (look for the Artful Dodger ...) and others.  I saw it as sort of an inside joke, and I loved it.  Its a great story, fabulous art, and an interesting premise.	2003-07-19

The story is set in Albania in 1377 - a watershed year for the region, as the Ottomans would decisively defeat the Serbs (and Albanians) at the battle of Kosovo Polje the next year, and forever change the Balkans.  Yet this event is never explicitly stated, the plot superficially dealing with the simple - and on the surface, mundane - construction of a bridge.<br /><br /> Kadare takes this everyday occurance and magnifies it, as we come to understand more about the people who live by the river, their daily lives (and superstitions) and the way a simple bridge will tie their little community to the rest of the world - with foreshadowing of the impact that will have.  The story is replete with plots and intrigue (what book set in the Balkans could not have a little intrigue).  But it was the prose that got to me.  Kadare's way with words caught my attention and held it with vivid visuals and characters with depth and emotion.  A great translation and a great book.	2003-07-16

However, perseverence won out, and I am glad it did; the story picked up nicely about  1/4 of the way into the book as the plot thickened.  It concluded strongly with a marvelously sinister twist at the end.  I'm glad I stuck with it.<br />At no point did I find the book funny - as a previous reviewer mentioned, this may be the result of a weak translation.  I suspect the plodding first few chapters are similarly the result of poor translating.  However, I did enjoy the way in which food was frequently refered to in the book, its prominence typcially Italian.<br />In the final analysis, The Shape of Water is good, but not great.  The story line is tight, and the plot will keep you riveted.  But I can't help but think that the book may be better in the original Italian.	2003-07-10

The perfect summer read.  In Everglades, Doc Ford wrestles with his personal failures while finding an old friend in trouble with a New Age spiritualist.  The story soon involves Ford's deep-thinking (and heavily spaced out) friend Tomlinson, who has had encounters of his own with the villian.<br />White is really maturing as a writer, as this book demonstrates.  His characters have a greater degree of depth, and his narrative flows between sequences flawlessly.  Of course, as one would expect from a RWW novel, he has much to say about his beloved south Florida and life in general as he does about the story line.  A strength of this book is that these points only ehance the plot rather than detract from it.  The only sticky point about the book is that the nature of the sub-plot requires readers to have read at least the previous book, Twelve Mile Limit in order to clearly understand whats going on.  Nonetheless, a recommended read.	2003-07-09

No easy feat. The book itself is broken down into 23 chapters, one for each chromasome in the human body.  Each chapter disucsses a specific gene on that chromasome, and with it the remarkable history of humankind, and indeed, all living things.  I was astounded that deep within our genetic code is the story of our species' evolutionary history.  But Ridley goes well beyond this in his marvelous book.<br />The nature of inherited diseases is discussed in a fascinating chapter on how our genes can work to protect us, and (in rare cases), horribly debiliate us.  Race is addressed, as is one's prediliction for heart disease.  Of particular interest to me was his exploration of cancer, possible reasons for its development, and a tantilizing glimps into how cancer research is being conducted to combat it.<br />I am not a scientist.  But I have a much clearer understanding of not only genetics, but also how each life form is constantly changing and adapting itself in the eternal dance of evolution. I highly recommend this book for its clear, concise and understandable way in which the author explains a most complex subject.	2003-07-06

Davita's Harp is told from the perspective Iliana Chandal, a pre-teen Jewish girl, the only daughter of two Marxists in New York City.  The description of the times and events is remarkable, as is the relationships within the Chandal family.  I was also impressed with Potok's ability to delve into the psyche of an adolescent girl, struggling to discover her place in the world, eventually embracing Judiaism (a faith her mother had left, and her father's family disapproves of.)  It really is an enjoyable, if light read.	2003-06-15

How ironic that a comic (\\"graphic novel\\" if you wish) so eloquently and powerfully details the horrors and long-term effects of that tragic time.  Spiegelman won a Pulitzer Prize for this work, and it is certainly deserved.  I was deeply moved by his and his father's (Vladek's) story.<br />The plot line is simple - how a Polish Jew managed to survive the first years of the war from the Nazi invasion to Spiegelman's s deportation to Auschwitz in 1944.  Yet his survival was anything but simple.  The story is riveting, and honestly I am amazed how anyone managed to endure and survive those cruel years.  Yet the way the story is presented amplifies the impact of the Holocaust.  Cartoons are so simple and innocent.  Here they describe and detail the barbarism, brutality and sheer evil of the \\"Final Solution.\\"<br />The drawings, too have a double meaning.  The Jews are mice - helpless when rounded up by the predatory Nazi cats.  The Poles are pigs (fitting, given generations of Polish anti-semitism), Americans are dogs (as in \\"dog-face.\\")  It makes the story accessable, even a little easier to comprehend.  (We can all understand \\"cat - and mouse\\" - indeed, this is exactly how Vladek Spiegelman managed to survive.)  Easy to read, very accessable to all ages, and equally powerful.	2003-05-03

As if the suffering and hardships the Spiegelmans faced before Auschwitz were not enough, upon arriving,  Vladek says \\"... here my troubles began.\\"  The daily competition for survival, the pressure and stress of not knowing when one would be sent to the ovens (\\"if\\" was never a consideration), the hell on earth that Auschwitz must have been are all vividly depicted in this marvelous book.  And as in _Maus_ the \\"double-entendre\\" cartoon characters graphically illustrate the relations between Jews, Americans, Nazis and Poles.<br />Here we also learn a little more about the author, his struggles with the fame and attention _Maus_ brought him, the issues he has with his father and deceased brother.  The majority of the book, however, revolves around Vladek's struggle to survive.  Through a great deal of wit, quick thinking and luck, he does.  However, after completing the book, one wonders what kind of life he has had since the Holocaust - in many ways, it destroyed him.  (In one scene, Vladek is moaning in his sleep.  The author's wife asks what the sound is -  Spiegelman matter-of-factly responds that as a kid he thought ALL grown-ups made sounds like that when they slept.)  _Maus II_ also provides some closure  - to both Art Spiegelman and the reader, as we come to a clearer understanding of the person Vladek was through understanding the events that made him.  It is every bit as good as _Maus_ and really should be read soon after it.	2003-05-03

There is no combat.  There is none of  the macho behaviour.  Rather we get an intellectual, a free spirit, a reservist who prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had been UA from his unit for three months.  The writer, therefore provides a unique perspective on the conflict.<br />His writing is solid, but I was not terribly impressed with the book.  As a driver, Turnipseed's experiences brought back many memories of my own experiences in the Gulf War - boredom, mind-games, the occasional SCUD alarm to break the monotony.  But I found his philosophical musings a bit tiresome (as did some of his compadres, by the sound of it.)  A deep thinker, a wise-guy, an earnest young man, a promising writer - Turnipseed is all of these things.  And while there are instances in his book that are downright humorous(the fomation before he embarks for the Gulf, and the formation when he returns both brought a chuckle) in the final analysis, the book is not riveting material.	2003-04-26

Black Elk gives an eye-wtiness account of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the campaigns of Crook, and the Massacre at Wounded Knee.<br />It is on the surface the life story of Black Elk, but it is also the story of the Lakota people - as you read it, you get an appreciation of Lakota life and culture.  As another reader pointed out, one wonders what was left out, but on the whole there is very little to suggest of a &quot;noble savage&quot; subtext to the book.  Of course it ends on a quasi-tragic note - the Lakota living on a reservation in South Dakota, Black Elk an old man, feeling helpless to return the power of the &quot;people's hoop&quot; to his band.  Much more than history, it is also poetry and a reminder of what America has lost of its indigenous soul.  The book has something to offer everyone, even if it is a simple reflection on our own lives and culture as compared to that of the Native Americans.	2003-04-12

What Swofford has written is exactly what I loved - and hated - about the Marine Corps and the Gulf War.  He doesn't pull any punches.  Much of the book revolves around becoming a Marine (not so much about boot camp, but the experiences that change a \\"boot\\" to a \\"salt\\") and the long (long ...) wait before the ground war began.  This works well.  It gives the reader a sense of what the \\"real\\" Marine Corps is like, and the concerns, troubles and issues many of the young men and women face everyday in the military.  The profanity, pranks and hard living are all accurate, as are the worries, tears and sense of esprit de corps between platoon members.  Neither a recruiting tool nor anti-war propoganda, Swofford simply and eloquently tells it like it is (and was in 1990 - 1991.)<br />His recollections of the ground war are similarly right on the mark.  Since the actual assult to liberate Kuwait lasted only a few days, it makes sense that it should play a similarly minor role in the book.  This, however, does not detract from the power of Swofford's words.  In my opinion, it is among the best memoirs of war, and certainly the best account of the Gulf War  I have read.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to understand what the Gulf or the Marine Corps was like.	2003-04-07
US	48135836	R2QSAIAYFKRRLM	0156421178	802050474	Homage to Catalonia	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Marvelous Read	I picked up Homage to Catalonia on a whim.  I am glad I did.  Orwell writes in magnificent prose his experiences as an idealistic young man taking up arms to fight the spread of fascism.  It concludes with a disillusioned, near mortally wounded (but still idealistic) Orwell  fleeing the country for his life -  a wanted criminal in the land he fought and bled to save.  While he spent only a few months in Spain, but his vivid descriptions of the personalities he met, the hardship he endured and the near-fatal gunshot wound he received clearly impacted him in a profound way.  His account will similarly impact the reader.<br />Homage to Catalonia is really two books - one is the graphic retelling of Orwell's daily existence with the POUM (a Marxist group of revolutionaries), his impressions of his fellow militia-men, the privations they suffered, and the combat that they hardly ever saw.  The other is Orwell's first-hand account of the politics &quot;behind the scenes&quot;; the Machiavellian plotting and schemeing between various revolutionary groups, the half-truths (and outright fabrications) of the media, the jockeying of politicians and nations in what would become the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the Second World War.  Much to my amusement, Orwell realizes he is writing two books, and point-blank invites the reader to &quot;skip&quot; the political analysis and get to the &quot;good stuff&quot; if the reader so wishes.<br />In either case, Orwell wrote a tragedy.  A tragedy that Spain had to suffer as it did.  And that such noble ideas (as those Orwell himself fought for) were eventually washed away with Great Power &quot;realpolitik.&quot; The book was written while the civil war was still playing itself out;  I beleive Orwell saw the writing on the wall.  Highly recommeded reading.	2003-01-08

The observations, thoughts and reflections of the author reflect the Zen aspect of the samurai code (&quot;a samurai should reflect daily and in the most graphic manner his demise&quot;), as well as the strong Confucian influence on Japanese culture (the tale of his Master, Nabeshima Mitsushige, covering his face with his sleeve in order not to see his men flustered when a wounded boar lunged at a hunting party) in addition to the crisis of peace the samurai faced under the Tokugawa Shogunate (providing advice on how to practice severing heads on the condemned.)<br />All in all it was fascinating, and a marvelous &quot;picture in time.&quot; I recommend this before reading Sun Tsu (&quot;The Art of War&quot;) or  Mushashi (&quot;A Book of Five Rings.&quot;)	2002-12-29
US	48135836	RAKWINFKQU4ZM	0898752337	388504143	Taras Bulba	Books	3	10	13	N	N	Not at all what I expected from Gogol	I like Gogol - I loved &quot;Dead Souls' and &quot;The Nose&quot;.  But Taras Bulba totally caught me by surprise - which was (ironically) both pleasant and a disappointment.  The story tells the tale of the Zaphorizhian Cossacks of the Ukriane and their struggle for independence from the domination of the Cathlic Poles.  Returning from university, Taras Bulba's sons Ostap and Andrei partake in their first Cossak foray into the steppe.  Enroute, Andrei falls in love with a Polish nobleman's daughter, and in the seige the follows, betrays his hetman (leader) and people to defend her.  Tragedy ensues.<br />First, I was disappointed by the lack of depth he wrote for his characters - they never really sprung to life for me.  Rather, they read more like charactures - carousing, drinking, rallying to the &quot;true, Orthodox faith&quot;, pirating and plundering.  This is as true of the minor characters as it is of Taras Bulba and his sons themselves - characters you would expect more &quot;fleshing out&quot; given the nature of the novel.  I was also disappointed by the lack of scope - for a novella about the struggle for Ukrainian independence, the story itself was remarkably thin, dealing only with the events surrounding Tara's attack upon an unnamed Polish city, and his subsequent quest for revenge.<br />However, there is much to like about Taras Bulba.  As one would expect from Gogol, the imagry is fabulous - vivid descriptions of Cossack life from their humble steppe homes, to their flamboyant dress, to the very way in which they drink themselves into a stupor.  For this alone, the book is worth the time and effort to read it.	2002-12-22

The story is a tale of three families living through the turbulent 70's:  the Yom Kippur War, Entebbe, the bombing the Iraqi nuclear reactor.  I can only give it 3 stars because he punctuates the book with star-crossed lovers and familial relations that are almost as complicated as those between Near East nations.  I found this distracting from the story he was telling.  Wouk also tends to simplify Israeli relations with the wider world and presents only the Israeli perspective on events.<br />Yet this is historical fiction, so he is due a little slack.  To Wouk's credit, he accurately describes the lbehind-the-scenes political manoeverings of men of state, the maddening lack of action on critical intelligence and the frustrating (and burdensome) Israeli bureaucracy.  His account of Israeli drivers is also frighteningly close to the mark.  An entertaining read.	2002-08-31

Of the 9 stories contained in the collection, 3 in particular are worth noting: The Raid was  an interesting tale of life on the \\"frontier\\" of Ukraine - and is not unlike a Louis L'Amour viginette.  Tolstoy pulls no punches here, and the line between \\"good guy\\" and \\"bad guy\\" is blurred.  Two Hussars is another favorite of mine, mostly because of the way in which he writes the characters - so real you can imagine meeting them in person in some dimly-lit pub.  How Much Land Does a Man Need?  is the third short story that resonnated with me, as it wrestles with the typically Russian theme of a man and his attachment to the land, but also with the broader human theme of need versus greed.  (Especially resonant in our own time, what with ozone depletion, increased consumption of fossil fuels, and over population.)  While the other stories are good, these 3 in particular make the book worth the purchase price.  Don't think of it as \\"Tolstoy\\" - read it for its own sake - its a thumping good book.	2002-08-15

And Last Flight Out is good -  &quot;Survival Spanish&quot; had me in stitches and &quot;Those Who Hide Behind the Caskets of Innocents&quot; captures the sentiments of America better than anything I have read on 9/11.  I also enjoyed his unraveling of the &quot;Mossman&quot; tale in Sun Valley (we've got folks like that in Oregon, too).  Yet after finishing the collection of his essays, I was left wanting.  To judge Last Flight Out fairly, there is much to like here, but it pales in comparison to his earlier work.  The humor and matter-of-fact writing style that makes him so enjoyable is still present, but the articles are a bit testosterone leaden for my taste.  For example, White's bantering about travel in rural Cuba (in &quot;Cuba&quot;), his bragging about &quot;dangerous friends&quot; in Central America in &quot;Bike Cops&quot; and his scoffing at those Americans who were too intimidated to fly after 9/11 in the introduction  wore a bit thin on me.<br />If you are familiar with Randy Wayne White, you will find much to like and laugh at here.  If you are browsing for adventure / travel books, I recommend starting with Batfishing in the Rainforest first.	2002-08-03

Little has been written by those actively engaged in the business.  William Hood, the nom de plume of a retired CIA officer, gives his story of the first Soviet agent recruited by American intelligence during the Cold War.  It is a fascinating, true-life tale.  I would recommend this book exclusively on this point, yet there is more to the book than this. It is also a detailed and highly personal account of how spycraft is practiced, the mental and psychological toll this takes, and the risks involved (for both agent and controller).  Because of this,  I highly recommend this book.  I have never read anything like it.<br />I would add that Hood provides a wealth of books of a similar vein (ie. accounts from intelligence field officers)  that may also be of interest.  It is without doubt an engrossing and intriguing read.	2002-06-29

I was impressed and pleased.  Impressed with Frasier's scholarship (the fictional Flashman's interactions with real historic persons and events is accurate, as his extensive endnotes demonstrate).  Pleased with the irreverant, wholly unconventional and most certainly un-PC character of Harry Flashman.<br /> In the Angel of the Lord, Flashman - a scandalous character &quot;resurrected&quot; from the 19th century novel Tom Brown's Schooldays and a self-described &quot;bully, poltroon, cad, turncoat, lecher and toady&quot; - finds himself aiding  John Brown in his raid at Harper's Ferry.  Conspiracies abound with several factions enlisting the &quot;assistance&quot; of Flashman to either foil the attempt or help pull it off.  The misadventures of Harry Flashman as he navigates the intrigue and double-dealing combined with the Fraiser's rapier-like wit and irreverant style had me riveted to the story line while laughing out loud.  I will certainly read the remainder of the &quot;Flashman Chronicles&quot; and I recommend this one highly.	2002-06-26

Harry Potter is growing up, and the danger that he faces is as sinister as it is real.  The story revolves around a competition between the various Wizarding schools, Hogwarts, Beaubaton and Durmstrang, and a plot by \\"You-Know-Who\\" to (surprise!) kill Harry Potter.<br /> As always, the new characters are delightful and as believeable as ever.  The plot twists will keep you guessing (and as usual, your guesses as to who the villian is will be wrong) as you learn more about Harry's past (and the past of others - such as Dumbledore and Snape for example.)  Yet  there is a darkness to this book, which may be off-setting to some.  There are stormclouds gathering on the horizon, and trouble is afoot.  Nonetheless I am confident you will love this book as much as the others.	2002-06-22

(This holds true for the story in its entirety as well.)  Once again Rowling has made kids of us all as you are drawn into her magical world.

The imagination of Ms. Rowling allows adults (such as myself) to again feel the magic of youth.<br />In _The Chamber of Secrets_, the plot centers around Hogwarts students who are being turned to stone, and a possible plot to once again harm our intrepid hero, Harry.  Rowling's prowess at writing a mystery is just as adept as her writing of fiction.  It is simply a delighful read and I highly recommend it.	2002-06-18

Divided into monthly chapters, the book explores the wonders of natural magick and the nature of wicca.  It is not written to be read cover-to-cover, but rather to be gradually digested, each chapter discussing an aspect of wicca with ideas and concepts to be meditated on and thought about over the course of the moon before the reader goes on and reads the next chapter.<br />If you are interested in wicca or natural magick, or are simply curoius about the goddess tradition, this is the FIRST book I would recommend you read.  (After which I strongly recommend Starhawk's The Spiral Dance.)  It is easy to read, the concepts are clearly written, and it is an excellent starting point for  a solitary practitioner.<br />If you are already a practicing witch, A Witch Alone is a fantastic book for reconnecting and recharging one's spiritual energy, as well as for providing focus points for meditation and thought.

But it is as a horror / thriller that this book is at its best.<br />Leave your expectations behind - the original is very unlike most of the films inspired by it (Coppola's \\"Brahm Stoker's Dracula\\" is the closest to the book) - I recommend you read it on its own merits.

After reading the book, you are literally drained emotionally; this above anything else makes it a masterpiece.  There are no riveting characters, the plot is simply survival.

Lepore's detailing of a seminal event in colonial American history highlights it as a precedent for future relatins between Native Americans and European Americans, while insightfully exploring the clash of cultures that was at the root of the conflict.<br />Much of the book is concerned with the way in which the Puritains (and other New Englanders) interpreted the war and its aftermath - yet the issue of cultural misunderstanding and fear of each other is never far from the surface - Native Americans fearing becomming &quot;Anglicanized&quot; and the fears of the European colonists &quot;going native.&quot;<br /><br />Lepore's accont of the conflict, its causes and immeadiate aftermath was excellent. I cared less for the final third of the book where events were romanticized for mass consumption (ie. the idea of the Native Americans as &quot;noble savages&quot;) even as the Plains Tribes were being systematically decimated and relocated much as the Native Americans of Massachusetts and Connecticut were before them.<br />In spite of this criticism, a marvelous book.  I recommend it.	2001-12-31

However, the authors have compiled accurate responses on how to survive any number of situations - granted, most of them are far fetched ... but what if?  For example, the &quot;how to preform a tracheotomy&quot; (more accurately a &quot;cricothyroidotomy&quot;) is absoutely correct in its explaination and diagrams.  Ditto for fractures, frostbite, and snakebites.<br />In the final analysis, lighten up people - being caught in the extreme situations described in the book is outlandish - and therefore the thought of it is funny. But the survival techniques described are the real deal. (Lets hope we don't have to use them.)	2001-12-31

Those interviews are the stories included in his book, &quot;The Good War.&quot;<br />If you are looking for a collection of &quot;war stories&quot; by combat veterans sharing their yarns of heroism under fire, look elsewhere; while there are some of those experiences here, the bulk of the book deals with the wider scope of the conflict - from &quot;Rosie the riveter&quot; to Japanese detainees, to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (including Americans who occupied the cities weeks after the bombings.  Sadly, they share similar stories.)<br />It is an interesting glimpse in time - of &quot;simpler times&quot; - when racism was the status quo (Terkel includes the experiences of Tuskeegee airmen and Naval ammo handlers and stevedores), when the military was segregated, when women took up jobs for the war effort, fully expecting to be fired once the war was over.<br />Terkel's book is primarily concerned with the experiences of Americans during the war, although he interviews some on the &quot;other side&quot; - a German war bride retelling her experiences during a bombing raid (the same raid her husband happened to be on - ironically bombing her town), of a German U-boat crew, of Japanese civlians.  Their perspectives provide some balance to the book.<br />In the final analysis, it is an interesting read - not the sort of thing one could read cover-to-cover all at once; better, I think to read a few interviews and set it down, giving one the opportunity to reflect on how the seminal event of the twentieth century influenced not only those interviewed, but all of us.  A worthwhile read.	2001-12-31

Studs Terkel interviewed dozens of people for his oral history, &quot;Hard Times.&quot;  What you get is a very good overall picture of the Great Depression in America.<br /> Terkel interviewed the rich, gangsters, southern sharecroppers, Oakies and Arkies, the rural poor, young and old (in the 1930's as well as in the 1960's when he was interviewing people.)  The perceptions of the Depression by each is as individual and as varied as America itself.  What struck me most, however was the inequitability of the Depression.<br /> When I thought of the &quot;Depression&quot; images of soup lines and &quot;Hoovervilles&quot; sprang to mind.  And yes, many remembered those as well.  But there were several interviewees who never saw a bread line, a shanty town, or felt the sting of economic crash.  To my suprise, there were even a few individuals who became RICH as a result of the Depression.<br /> Another interesting aspect of the book (which was totally unexpected) was the reflection of the &quot;present&quot; while looking back at the Deperession.  Terkel assembled the book in the late 1960's; as you may imagine, the social turbulence and youth culture of the day was often brought up in the various interviews ... fascinating.<br /> All in all an interesting and engaging read - if nothing else, it certainly puts things in perspective relative to the &quot;hard times&quot; the nation faced in the 1930's.  The book is not for everyone, but I do recommend it.	2001-12-13

In a nutshell the inept, myopic and largly ignorant bureaucracy of the Entente Powers (Britian and France specifically) laid the foundation for the issues the Middle East now struggles with.<br /> From the Sykes and Balfour proposals in Palestine, to the support given the Saud family in Arabia, to the creation of &quot;Trans-Jordan&quot;, &quot;Iraq&quot; and &quot;Kuwait&quot; (all of which were artifically created entitites desigend to suit the needs of the European powers) we see the rivalries and tensions that persist to the present day emerge, as voices of reason (T.E. Lawrence, for example) are drowned out by bureaucrats. While Fromkin argues that European involvement in the Middle East had been ongoing for nearly a century by 1918, the bulk of the book is concerned with events between 1917 - 1922.  The result was a hodge-podge mosaic of European &quot;mandates&quot; (ie. colonies) and locally run fiefdoms (such as Arabia).  Little wonder the area is known for its political instability.<br /><br /> A Peace to End all Peace is balanced in its approach to the subject and its treatment of key figures (both European, Jew, and Arab). The only criticism I have is its emphasis on politics at the expense of social and economic factors.  It seems to me that one of the major flaws in the creation of the modern Middle East was a lack of understanding of local society and economics - a fact that persists to this day, and an obstacle to the establishment of effective communication between West and East.  Nonetheless, I recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in a deeper examination of the Middle East.	2001-11-19

As a reviwer noted earlier, the first part of the book outlines what spycraft is and is not, what the theory of intelligence work is, and how it is practiced.  Pay close attention, as the vocabulary used and techniques discussed are put into practice later in the book.<br />The second half of the book details Felix's work as an operations officer (i.e. &quot;spy&quot;) in Hungary at the end of the Second World War.  Here the glamourous and mundane work of espionage is recounted in an almost casual manner, as are the daily challenges and frustrations the author experienced while working there.<br />There are litterally hundreds of books written on the subject - yet in my opinion, A Short History is among the best. The writing is clear and lucid, and captivates the reader's attention; the material related is all first hand, and while a little dated, the lessons taught are relevant and comprehensive.  A must read for anyone interested in learning more about the real practice of intelligence gathering.	2001-07-11

While managing to stay above the fray of inter-ethnic rivalries, Glenny provides a clear picture of modern Balkan history, arguing that the troubles the region suffers from is not the result of years of mutual ethnic hatereds, but rather the result of constant interference by the Great Powers (whomever that may be at the time.)  The book is just short of encyclopedic - its depth and scope can be overwhelming at times. Nonetheless, I found it a fascinating read.  Glenny looks beyond &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; in his study of the Balkans, giving attention to Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania as players (and victims) in the &quot;Eastern Quesiton.&quot;  This is as it should be.  His argument about &quot;outside forces&quot; interfereing with the nationalistic development of the Balkan peoples is convinving.  Yet there are flaws. The Slovenes are hardly addressed at all; one would think they warrant at least some consideration in any discussion of the area. Comparitively little time is spent on Romania and Bulgaria after the Second World War, and even less is devoted to the sticky issues of the Vojvodina, Banat and Backa - all of which face similar issues with Serbia as Kossovo does. My final criticism is his all too brief treatment and hasty analysis of the &quot;disintegration&quot; of Yugoslavia in the early 90's.  With that said, I recommend this book to the serious reader or student of the region only. The information is dense, the history is complicated, and the major players (within and without the Balkans) can confuse the uninitiated. I am confident you will enjoy The Balkans as much as I did.	2001-06-14

As such it is hardly an interesting read - in fact, I would venture so far to say that it is downright dull.  Kessler laboriously explains the table of organization of the CIA - what the 5 directorates are and what they do (in the abstract) with very little by way of specifics. The few interviews Kessler conducted in his preparation for this book were with former Directors - very little from the &quot;men in the field.&quot;  Most of the information Kessler presents can easily be found elsewhere, in a much abbreviated form, and at less cost than the book.  If you are interested in a book about what the function of the CIA is and how it is organized to carry out its mission, this is the book for you.  If you are interested in something about spycraft or are searching for stories about individual CIA operations, look elsewhere.  In spite of its catchy title, you will be disappointed.	2001-03-31

It is the story of the battle of Thermoplyae where a vanguard of 4000 Greeks held off an invading army of 300,000 Persians for over a week while the rest of Greece readied itself. The battle was a phyrric one for the Persians, whose later defeat ushered in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Greece with Pericles, Socrates, Plato and the rest.<br />At the heart of the story is the tale of the Spartans and their helots. Pressfield masterfully describes their training and daily life, presenting them as real people, not superhuman warriors - people who fear death, maiming and the violence of combat, yet overcome it. He could not be more right when he writes:  &quot;They will come, scholars perhaps, or travelers from beyond the sea, prompted by curiosity regarding the past or appetite for knowledge of the ancients. They will peer across the plains and probe among the stone and rubble of our nation. What will they learn of us? Their shovels will unearth neither brilliant palaces nor temples; their picks will prise forth no everlasting architecture or art. What will remain of the Spartans? Not monuments of marble or bronze, but this, what we do here today.&quot;<br />The battle scenes will get your blood moving, the romance will tug at your heart strings. You will stand in awe at the strength of the Spartan women. Its historical accuracy is questionable, but the story is excellent. I strongly recommend this book.	2001-02-27

As an expectant first time parent, naturally there were many questions about the whole process. And advice for first time parents is literally a dime a dozen - this book being no exception. Therefore my parenting caveat &quot;Follow your gut.&quot; Yet there are times when you have questions of whether what you are experiencing and feeling is normal. In these cases, my wife and I found this book helpful. (For example, &quot;What can I do for hemrrhoids?&quot; &quot;How long will this morning sickness last?&quot; &quot;Is it ok for me to eat sushi?&quot;) While every woman and every pregnancy is different, I recommend this book as a reference only.<br />I did take issue with the book's advice and tone on issues that seem to me to be more of a personal nature - for example whether or not to breast feed your baby. Or what type of sleeping arrangements should you make for your newborn. On these issues I found the book preachy, and frankly a bit fascist. Again - follow your gut on those decisions: its your baby.  Use What To Expect When You're Expecting as a medical reference only.	2001-02-19

Randy Wayne White again skillfully weaves fact and fiction with his typically witty prose. Ten Thousand Islands is loosly based on the real-life discovery of an ancient indian artifact that White extrapolates into a tale of greed, deceit and the drug-induced ramblings of Ford's psychedelic side-kick, Tomlinson. I have read all of White's Doc Ford novels, and this is his best work since the Heat Islands. The story is imaginative, the book moves at a good pace, and of course White's musings on Florida are right on the money. (&quot;Like a bus station, Florida attracts con men and predators. It always has. Florida always will.&quot;)<br />I recommend this book without reservation to Doc Ford fans, lovers of a good mystery, or those in the mood for an off-beat and unlikey hero in a wonderfully told story.	2001-02-19

Unfortunately, the book wasn't very good. The plot was labored and the story itself did not hold my interest.  It was not a good sign when midway through the book I couldn't care less if they found Joe Merchant or not. (The search for an allegedly deceased pop who is regularly sighted? Where have I seen THAT headline before?)<br />While the hero, Frank Brown's mis-adventures were mildly entertaining, and the sly allusions to characters in old Buffett songs was clever, it was not enough for me give it a higher rating. As other reviewers have mentioned, perhaps Jimmy was trying too hard. Buffett's first effort at writing is by far the better book.	2001-02-11

Where your job, your home and your mate are determined for you by the &quot;Well-Doer&quot; and thoughts and actions are closely monitored by the &quot;Guardians.&quot; This is not 1984 - this is Zamiatin's WE - predating Orwell by almost 25 years, and eerily describing the USSR under Stalin 10 years before its worst excesses.<br />The similarities between Zamiatin's world and Orwells are many and obvilious. Both are a biting satire of totalitarianism: its centralization of authority, its blatant disregard for human life and the crushing oppressiveness of the State. However I believe Zamiatin's to be the better story.<br />Orwell does not have Zamiatin's sarcastic use of the double entendre. And Zamiatin's writing style (especially his use of mathematical metaphors) reinforces the impersonal nature of his &quot;utopian&quot; society. Finally, Zamiatin's story is much more psychological than Orwells - much of the story takes place in the thoughts of the main character.<br />WE is rightly considered a masterpiece of modern Russian literature. If you have read 1984,  I highly recommend reading WE.	2001-02-04

Out of Africa is a memoir of her experiences there. But the book is so much more.<br /><br />The stories are interesting to be sure. They relate to the plantation or the people and events that one way or another impacted her life there.  But it is Blixen's writing that I found so sublime. I have never read anything like it. The way Blixen turns a phrase is both lyrical and enchanting all at once - you become literally swept up in the words and imagery. It is obvious that Blixen loved Africa - something about the continent got under her skin. In a similar fashion her words have gotten under mine. I have read Out of Africa several times; each time I marvel at the beautiful language she uses. Read this book and I am sure you will feel the same way.	2001-02-04

The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon - a journal of sorts really - is a collection of thoughts, impressions, lists and daily events of her life as a courtesan in the Imperial Palace. The language is beautiful and haunting - Sei Shonagon's writings were both wholly alien and disturbingly familiar to a western man in the 21st century.  For example, her musing about the seasons or her feelings about the quiet hours before dawn were as vivid as they were touching. Yet more than once while reading her pillow book, I couldn't help but think of her as a privlidged, effette snob. This attitude is understandable given her literacy and place in feudal Japanese society, but it rubbed me the wrong way nonetheless.<br /> The greatest challenge of reading this book though, was its non-sequential organization. One minute you would be reading about how an Imperial advisor came to call, the next entry would be an essay on &quot;Why Gentlemen Should Always Have Escorts&quot; followed by a list of&quot;Things I like about the Sakura festival&quot;. There was no rhyme or reason to the entries, making it difficult to read more than a few pages in a sitting.<br />I suppose one could read this book as a history - Sei Shonagon certainly gives an amazing glimpse into what court life was like in 11th century Japan.  But it is best as literature. In the final analysis, Sei Shonagon's thoughts and observations are simply beautiful to read.	2001-01-28

Andric has done a remarkable job of explaining the intracies of Balkan society through his story. Using the bridge as an eyewitness to 500 years of history, we see the rise and fall of empires as a community of Serbs, Croats, Jews, Christians and Moslems live, love and work side by side.<br />Contrary to what the media would have us believe, the ethnic groups of the Balkans have not \\"hated one another for 500 years and will continue to do so.\\" This book portrays Balkan life in a much more realistic manner than many newly published books on the subject have. If you are interested in the Balkans and are searching for a balanced view of what society was like before the current troubles, read this book. While it is fiction, the patterns of daily life, the social interactions and inter-ethnic relationships portrayed by Andric are right on the money.

Starhawk has done a truly outstanding job of providing the reader with an excellent groundwork for an introduction to wicca, providing invocations, rituals and meditations. But what I found most useful were her numerous mental exercises designed to develop awareness, improve visualization and meditaiton techniques. They have been extremely valuable to me.<br />Starhawk discusses the various aspects of Witchcraft at length as well, which is also useful reading. Chapters are devoted to the Goddess, the God, summoning and grounding energy, casting - everything one would expect in a book for beginner practioners but with much more depth in explaining the &quot;whys&quot; rather then simply the &quot;hows.&quot;<br />I would only add that the book is a little &quot;advanced&quot; for many new to witchcraft or wicca - the writing is pretty mature and techincal, albiet very good. If you have read Cunningham or Sliverwolf (who are both good), and are looking for something a little more mature, this would be my first choice. Enjoy! And bright blessings.	2001-01-17

Tolstoy's War and Peace has everything - a broad palatte of characters set to the greatest event of the 19th century - with conflict, romance, honor, courage, a beautiful (if initally maddeningly spoiled) heroine and a bookish (but likable) hero. This fabulous book is everything you've heard about it.<br />To many, the daunting size, scope and scale of War and Peace is a deterrent to reading it. Fear not: the story is so uttery engrossing, you will literally be unable to put the book down. Tolstoy's characters are almost real in their mannerisms, actions, thoughts and relationships - you feel almost kin to the central figures as they mature and change over time. The drama of the Napoleonic Wars, and the vidid descriptions of the life of the Russian aristocracy at its zenith also drew me into the story.<br />The book truly is a maserpiece of literature, and I highly recommend it. The only criticism I have is that Tolstoy, as usual, uses the book as a bully-pulpit to share his personal views, but unless you are specifically looking for them, they are negligable. (A hint: look for his themes of &quot;fate&quot; and &quot;destiny&quot; - there are others, but those are my favorites.)<br />There are many great works of literature - War and Peace certainly deserves to be counted among them.

A brilliant poet with a wonderful way with words, Bukowski is also a tragi-comic figure due to his alcoholism. The poems are haunting and sad, as the torment Bukowski suffered is painfully apparent. Ironically, his poetry is also beautiful if not downright moving.	2001-01-13

The stories are semi-autobigraphical, which is obvilious from the way O'Brein relates the tales. Vietnam was not my war - but I was surprised at how univeral many experiences were. It is one of the better works of fiction I have read, and is certainly one of the best works of fiction on war.	2001-01-13

But it seems at last there is a &quot;get rich&quot; book that has answers without the bells and whistles typically seen in this genre. And to its credit, the authors outright state that there is no such thing as &quot;getting rich quickly.&quot; Rather they point to late-middle aged people who have made their wealth the old - fashioned way: through hard work, living below their means, saving, planning and wise investing -the sort of thing your parents told you years ago. Its a worthwhile read - especially in this age of easy finacing, superabundandt credit cards and a &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; mentality.	2001-01-13

It became the book that sparked an interest in the history of disease and epidemics that persists to this day.<br />While the scope of the book seems broad, McNeill focuses on three specific epidemics )the Plague of Athens, the Bubonic Plague of the 1340's and the introduction of smallpox to the Americas) and the subsequent impact of these epidemics on history. Due to its out-of-the-ordinary approach, this book is really geared towards the serious history-junkie ot the epidemiologically minded.	2001-01-12

Desert Voices attempts to do just that - provide readers with the stories of those who served in Desert Shield and Desert Storm. As such, it makes for a useful history, as all branches of the service (even the Coast Guard) are represented, each providing a different persepctive on the war, but not an interesting read by any stretch of the imagination.<br />I am a Gulf War veteran, and many of the tales are similar to what I experienced. What frustrated me, however, was the lack of techincal understanding the author demonstrates of military abbreviations and slang - surprising, as he was a LtCdr in the US Navy. For example, in the glossary he explains &quot;FDC&quot; as &quot;Fire Detection Center&quot; - when in fact it is the &quot;Fire DIRECTION Center&quot; of an artillery battery. Similar mistakes are made when a Marine is quoted saying &quot;FDC&quot;, where LaBarge has transcribed it &quot;FTC&quot;, defined as &quot;Fleet Training Center&quot; - of which there is none. The book was rife with these errors.<br />Written to profit from the hype following the ending of hostilites, the book really seems hastily put together. It was hardly riviting (more &quot;ho hum&quot; reading, although that may be more the result of personal experience than anything else) and in the end, was not that good of a book. While I may be nit-picking, I feel that the author has a responsibility to be informed and accurate with the material before the book goes to print.	2001-01-12

This was frustrating, because at best it is pure speculation.<br />For example, Cartwright asks &quot;Was it syphilis that made Ivan IV &quot;Ivan the Terrible?&quot; and &quot;Did the Bubonic Plague hearld the beginning of the end of feudalism?&quot; I find such questions moot and pointless. If you are interested in this sort of thing there are several books I recommend over this one.

I found it fascinating. Zinsser discusses a number of diseases in a rambling manner (when he finally gets started on topic of the book ...) but its primary focus is on typhus and its influence on military and social history.<br />The book was a little slow to start to be sure - the first third of the book seems to be a direct affront to a hitherto un-named colleage. But the sections on disease and epidemiology are quite good. Zinsser has a dry sense of humor, is a bit of a snob, and at times is down right haughty. But patience pays off in the end.<br />For those interested in the subject of disease and history, and with a low tolerance for Zinsser's writing style, I would recommend Gina Kolata, or better yet, Alfred Crosby or William McNeil.	2001-01-11

Bruckshaw must have been quite a remarkable young man to have endured the hardships he faced with the stoicism and humor he demonstrates in his diaries. He died, killed in action, in April, 1917 - like so many others in that terrible war.<br />The dairies are literate, day-to-day accounts of the alternating terror and mundane existance that every combat veteran is familiar with. Reading them one feels a bit voyeuristic, but I found the accounts fascinating. Unless you are a serious student of World War One or the Galipoli campaign, I don;t recommed this book - I am certain you would find it dry. For the scholar or compulsive WWI reader, this is a very interesting personal account.	2001-01-11

Yes, even better than &quot;The Guns of August.&quot; Writing about the 20 - odd years before the start of World War One, Tuchman explores European society at the turn of the century, recalling the forces that eventually collided in 1914.<br />As she chronologically moves towards the beginning of the Great War, specific countries and specific social issues are addressed. This works well, and makes for a fast-paced intriguing read. However, Tuchman devotes most of her energies to on the personalities and forces in Western Europe with little more than a cursory nod to Russia and Austro-Hungarian Empire. Turkey, Italy and the balkans are hardly discussed at all, and even then only as they relate to Western Europe. This is peculiar, given the disproprotionate influence these areas had on the causes of the eventual conflict.<br />The Proud Tower is nontheless a wonderful social history of fin-de-sicle Europe. A better read on the same time period - and one that has more of a Central European focus is Frederick Norton's Thunder at Twilight.	2001-01-10

After thumbing through it, I knew I had to have a copy of my own. It is witty, humorous and surprisingly accurate. The authors intentionally don't take the subject matter seriously in deference to those legions of name droppers and intellectuals who do.<br />Each chapter covers a specific subject area (&quot;Art history&quot;, &quot;Film&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, etc.) which is further broken down into essential &quot;need-to-know&quot; sections like &quot;A Trio of Geographical Clarifications for a Nation that, Frankly Would Rather Skateboard&quot; or &quot;A Night at the Opera: manners and morals for the MTV Generation.&quot; The writing itself is similarly tongue-in-cheek. In a section titled &quot;How to Tell Keats from Shelly&quot; the authors write, &quot;Keats is the one you'd play racquetball with. He wasn't happy, exactly, but he was better adjusted and less the outcast then Shelly and it shows.&quot;<br />I certainly got a kick out of reading it. If you are searching for a good laugh that is also enlightening, (and will fill the holes in your college education), this is the book for you. But PLEASE don't take this book too seriously.	2001-01-10

The city: elegant, opulent, imperial Vienna.<br />Morton does a masterful job of describing the dark underbelly of a city at the brink of change, in the twilight of its splendor. The writing is supurb - you can almost taste the Sachertorte and smell the Cappucino on Ringstrasse as revolutionaries plot and intellectuals argue. Morton truly has captured the flavor of an age that is no-longer in a marvellous telling of a true story.<br />If you have ever visited Vienna (or better yet are about to for the first time) this is a must - read book. It would also be a good &quot;cold-winter night&quot; book or conversely a jaunty summer read. I enjoyed the book very much and I highly recommend it.	2001-01-09

I never heard of John Harrison, or really thought of how difficlt it must have been to accurately calculate longitude until I read this book. But there is more to the story of longitude than mathematics and engineering. The human story of longitude is brought to life in Sobel's Longitude.<br />Sobel does a very good job of explaining the intracies of the longitude problem, and relates the personal trials and frustrations of Harrison with a penchant for his personal fortitude and courage in the face of frustration and humiliation. I found her writing of the story to be truly inspiring.<br />The book without a doubt is a &quot;personal interest&quot; story, with only a minimum of explaination of how the timepieces actually functioned and the challenges their developement involved. To others, this evidentially detracted from the book - I disagree.	2001-01-09

What makes this out of the ordinary is that Manchester travels across the Pacific revisting the battle sites, re-telling their stories - and his own.<br /><br />His description of Guadalcanal is the best part, which is unfortunate, as it happens in the first half of the book. Manchester's strength is as a biographer - which does Goodbye, Darkness somewhat of a disservice. He does an outstanding job of painting vivid characterizations of Vandegrift, Nimitz and MacArthur, but at the expense of weakening what could have been a more memorable memoir. Manchester does a decent job of providing an overall view of the conduct of the war; but as far as personal accounts go, Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed is by far a better read.	2001-01-07

Captions, when written, are translated into English. The book is divided into five parts: Relationships, Lifestyles, Social Vices, Politics and Environment each with drawings that poke fun at Soviet life.  What is perhaps most surprising is the universality of the experiences contained within - everyone will be able to relate in some way with most of the humor.<br />As a Russian specialist, this book was of particular interest to me. For others, I suspect they may not find it that intriguing. As far as the artwork and type of cartoons: think of a Russian version of the New Yorker and you're pretty close to the mark.	2001-01-07

Beginning with the &quot;knowledge of the ancients&quot; (which, to my pleasure, included information from ancient India, China and the Americas as well as from Egypt and the Middle East), Van Doren covers all the great theories and discoveries of the human race. Although I read it cover to cover, it would be just as useful (and enjoyable) to dig in and read it piecemeal.<br />The contributions of Einstein, Newton and Galileo are here, as are the ideas of Buddha, Martin Luther and Boethius. This is more than just a cataloguing of ideas and discoveries, though. Portraits of these individuals are made, and their contributions are placed in historical context. What is most remarkable, however is that van Doren has managed to squeeze all this information into a mere 412 pages.<br />The only shortcoming of the book is perhaps is length - but Van Doren sets out only to summarize, highlight and explain. With this in mind, he does an admirable job. The book is simply fascinating, and I highly recommend it.	2001-01-06

The Year 1000 does just that, offering a month by month picture of what daily life was like in Britain 1000 years ago.

I had hoped Kolata's book would shed more light on the subject. I was disappointed. Instead of discussing the pandemic itself, I discovered the book was more of a documentary on two scientists competing for a sample of the flu virus - one searcing in Alaska, the other in nether reaches of Norway.<br />To liven the book up, Kolata spends an extraordinary amount of time contrasting the expeditions, which could not be more different in their approach to the subject: one is a lone epidemiologist working on a shoe string budget, the other working with a team of scientists with monied sponsorship. But this is not why I purchased the book. If you are more interested in the story of the disease itself, I recommend Alfred Crosby's America's Forgotten Pandemic. If not, you may find this book worthwhile.	2001-01-06

Whether you are looking for a spectacular read, are a student or just a history buff, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is of a caliber that is equally enjoyable to any of the above readers.<br />Beginning with a glimpse into the medieval European's mind, Manchester goes on to describe the key events and personalities that led to the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation - both of which are firmly rooted in the medieval tradition, both irreversably changing Europe into a modern society. The book is magnificent. Even though I am very familiar with the era, Manchester's writing kept me in rapt attention. In writing about individuals such as Lucretzia Borgia and Martin Luther, you truly get a feel for them as real people, not just dry names and dates as is so often the case in histories. Manchester also does a remarkable job of clarifying and explaining the events which were so influential to European (and world) history: the birth of the Renaissance, European exploration of the world, the Protestant Reformation, the Columbian exchange.<br />A World Lit Only By Fire is entertaining, fascinating and historically accurate. I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have - I strongly recommend this book.	2001-01-06

Te, the Taoist principle of the virtue of the small includes, according to Hoff, leaving a small footprint (as opposed to a large one) on the earth - as this book has a decidedly more ecological slant to it. Hoff remains true to the endearing format of the Tao of Pooh, but as he writes his diatribes against corporate culture and the evils of consumerism, its charm quickly wears off. Little wonder this book failed to inspire me as his previous book did.<br />Perhaps it was the almost preachy tone Hoff takes from time to time. Or maybe it was the fact that I simply became bored and distracted at the minutae of the philosophy. Possibly I didn't like the book because I don't like Piglet as much as I like Pooh. There are numerous reasons for my dislike of the Te of Piglet - there are so many, I honestly cannot put my finger on a single specific reason. If you had been hoping, as I had, that the Te of Piglet would be as good or better than the Tao of Pooh, you will be diasppointed.	2001-01-05

Yet I have to give it only four stars because the &quot;other stories&quot; included in the book really pale in comparison.<br />A River Runs Through It has all the majesty and beauty of the American West written with the deep emotion and reverance MacLean attaches to fly-fishing (he compares it to religion). The other stories (&quot;Logging and Pimping&quot; and &quot;USFS 1919&quot;) relate to MacLean's experiences working in the Montana Rockies with the Forest Service, and for some reason did not move me as the former story did. His relationship with his brother in A River Runs Through It particularly spoke to me.<br />All of MacLean's stories are good, but it is MacLean's easygoing narrative, vivid prose and almost spiritual way in which he turns a phrase that makes this book so special. It is an outstanding example of modern American writing, and should be read for such - not fishing.	2001-01-05

This book wasn't quite what I had expected when I picked it up: an essay on Christianity in the early middle ages on the fringes of Christendom. I was pleasantly surprised nonetheless. The book moves at a good pace, it is historically accurate, and is informative without being dry.<br /><br />The tale of how exactly the Irish saved civilization really revolves around what else was going on in Europe as the last vestiges of the Roman Empire in western Europe crumbled. Cahill does a masterful job of retelling the role Irish monks played in preserving \\"knowledge.\\" His conclusion was especially good. My only bone of contention is Cahill's assertion that it was the Irish who saved civilization - as if the Byzantines and Moslems had nothing to do with the \\"preservation\\" (let alone the advancement) of \\"civilization.\\" His equation of western Christendom with civilization is a point that I heartily disagree with.	2001-01-05

This is much easier to read and understand than the I Ching (Book of Changes) or the Tao ti Ching (Book of the Way.) With Pooh as your guide, Hoff clearly articulates the lessons and tenets of the Tao (&quot;the Way&quot;).<br />Taoism, a Chinese peasant religion and philosophy, was founded by Lao Tzu in the 5th century BC. Essentially it urges its followers not to resist the natural ebb and flow of life - after all, nature will always win, so why waste the energy? Hoff, using Pooh and the other characters of the Hundred Acre Wood, illustrate how &quot;the Way&quot; is practiced in day-to-day situations.<br />Yet there is more to this wonderful little book than an elucidation of Taoism in practice. Hoff takes neither himself or his subject too seriously, often times having &quot;conversations&quot; with Pooh who, in his almost child-like simplicity, both emphasizes and embodies living &quot;the Way&quot;.<br />This is no children's book - but it is fun to read for its message, its messenger and its content. I recommend it without reservation.	2001-01-05

Without prosletyzing or moralizing, Cahill clearly and simply elucidates the tremendous intellectual debt Western Civilization owes the Jewish faith.<br />The &quot;gifts&quot; are everywhere - from our concept of law and justice, to the way in which we think about art and literature. Using the Old Testament as a template, Cahill demonstrates just how much of Western Civilization and Western thinking has been influenced by the stories and fables of the Jewish people. The Gifts of the Jews was enlightening, made all the more powerful by the simple, almost conversational tone of the book. It is rare to find a book that deals with religion neutrally while communicating its value and importance to the wider world. I am neither a Christian or a Jew - yet I fully appreciate and am thankful for the gifts of the Jews. I am also thankful to Cahill for bringing this to my attention.	2001-01-05

Some are good, a few are excellent, but most are lacking. Sarajevo Daily sadly falls into the latter category.  Gjelten uses the cities daily newspaper Oslobodjenje as a metaphor for the the destruction of Yugoslavia and as an example of the painful bloodletting Sarajevo experienced. The idea works to some extent, and the book is well written - Gjelten is a journalist, after all. But it is the way in which the topic is approached that left me wanting. There is no doubt that the violence in Sarajevo was heart-wrenching. Yet one cannot help but think that events there are greater than the daily challenges of a newspaper and its staff. A better book by far is Misha Glenny's The Balkans.	2001-01-04

In it, the history of the Middle East from pre-Islamic times to the present is chronicled - the majority of the book covering the Islamic world.<br />To one previously only briefly familiar with the area, the book was a little overwhelming. The information came fast and furious; fortunately the book was well written and read easily. Much of it deals not with political history, but rather with broader social themes: rural life compared to urban life, the common man compared to the educated elite, women and their role in Islamic society.<br />The only issue I had with this otherwise wonderful book was its lack of explaination of the various legal philosophies. (I am still puzzled between the differences of Hanafi, Maliki and Shaf'i interpretations of shari'a - Islamic law.) The fact that this is such a minor point given the scope of the book is testament to its otherwise fabulous nature.	2001-01-04

Kaplan writes about the Balkans country by country (including Greece, appropriately enough), providing little viginettes of each nation and some historical background. There is very little discussion of local society, and it is almost devoid of local &quot;flavor.&quot;<br />If you are searching for a light, solid introduction to the Balkans without the ethnic partisanship that is so common, this is a good place to start.

Michael Shaara's Pulitzer-Prize winning Killer Angels is so good that I make an exception in its case. The book works on a variety of levels, which in my opinion separates it from the rest of the genre.<br />On one level is the story of the battle of Gettysberg itself, which Shaara does an exemlpary job of describing. On another level is the complex interaciton of personalities - characters based on real people, many of whom had been educated together at West Point, served together in peace and war and who were close friends before the Civil War began. A third level uses the battle itself as a microcosm for the Civil War, exploring the various motivations behind participants from both north and south.<br />The book is truly a masterpiece of fiction. The drama created by Shaara's dialogue is enhanced by real events, but the real genius of the story is its many facets. I recommend this book to anyone -serious civil war buff or those simply looking for a good book to engross themselves in. You won;t be disappointed.	2001-01-02

After having spent some time in Russia, it was recommeded to me by a friend. While I enjoyed the story, the reviews I have heard (and read) overrate it a bit. I don;t want to tell you too much about the plot, but to briefly summarize, it involves a school in the USSR for training KGB agents to behave like Americans.<br />As one would expect from a novel in this genre, there is plenty of action, intrugue and double-crosses. DeMille does a great job of keeping the reader's attention, if not exactly keeping them on the edge of their seat. The story was good, but I found it a little too predicatable in spots. I was, however, disappointed by the climaxes resolution - I found it to be terribly unimaginative and a little bit far - fetched in an otherwise believeable novel.<br />I will read other DeMille books, to be sure - he is an entertaining writer. But I felt that The Charm School was hardly worth the rave reviews I had imagined it to be.	2001-01-02

First was how close the experiences of the characters were to my own and those of my friends - even though the book is a work of fiction. The other was how incredibly average and mundane the book was.<br />Yes, there was the snyde humor Copeland is famous for - I especially liked the definistions found in the margins (&quot;McJob&quot; is a personal favorite.) But the story quickly became stale, and the end of the book really disappointed me. Perhaps Coupland intended it that way as further commentary on contemporary society - or perhaps its the result of a sophomore writer. In the final analysis, the book left me bland.	2001-01-02

It is extremely difficult to accurately capture the flavor of the original writing in translation, but Kunitz has done this and more - the English itself is poetry. The book is dual language, so readers of Russian can read the original next to the English. Both are excellent.<br />The selection is fairly representative of Akhmatova's life work, with early poems from 1909, through her affair with the poet Blok in the teens, the Terror and War, to her deathbed in 1961.  I particularly enjoyed the translation of the epic &quot;Requiem&quot;.  Without a doubt, this is the best English version I have ever read. My only complaint is its berevity - at 40 poems, it merely whets the readers appetite for more - a pity, given the outstanding nature of both poet and translator.<br />For those who are not familiar with Anna Akhmatova, this is a gem. If you have read some of her work, this is a must-have volume.  Enjoy!	2001-01-01

Perhpas most alarming of all, however, is Grossman's argument that our children are learning many of these same techniques from television and video games.<br />This is not a diatribe against the television and gaming industries. It is a commentary on how people learn to kill, how those who have killed cope, and what the consequences of killing is to individuals and to society. (Grossman's conclusions may surprise you.)<br />The book has much to say on the costs of killing,and about human nature. In light of high school tragedies like Paducah, Springfield and Columbine, the book shed a little light on what we are doing to ourselves - both in the military and civilian world.	2001-01-01

After a brief chapter about his introduction into the Marine Corps, Sledge brings us with him into the fetid, humid hell that was the Pacific theater. Sledge, a mortarman with 3/5, 1st Marine Division, graphically details his experiences at Peleliu (a pointless battle) and Okinawa.<br />His tales are moving and brutal. In one account, his vivid description of digging a fighting hole only to find the rotting corpse of a Japanese soldier 2 feet down literally made my skin crawl. Elsewhere he recounts the bitter personal brutality that was all too common between US Marines and Japanese soldiers. After reading this book, you will understand what Sledge meant when, in the introduction he writes, &quot;it has been a burden to retain this story.&quot; We should be thankful that Sledge decided to share his burden with posterity, lest we forget the awful price paid by all who were involved.	2001-01-01

Chronicling the Lewis and Clark expedition, Ambrose takes us on the arduous trek up the Missouri, across the plains and over the Great Divide to the storm swept Oregon coast - and then back.<br />The book is chronologically organized, giving the reader a sense of the grinding challenges Lewis and Clark faced, with abundant details giving the reader a sense of accompanying the explorers on their journey. The maps (and there are several) are also helpful in re-tracing their steps. But Ambrose goes beyond the journey itself, occasionally giving the reader a glimpse of the world that was to come to the Native Americans Lewis and Clark encountered - indeed, foreshadowing the volitile relationship that Native Americans would have with the US government for the next 200 years.  He concludes the book with an epilogue of the participants of the expedition - some returned to the Rockies as mountain men (John Coulter, for example), others simply vanished from history.<br />As the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition approaches, this is a must read book for ANYONE who wishes to have more than a passing familiarity with one of the seminal events in American history.	2000-12-31

The lives of the 5 Marines and 1 Navy Corpsman are chronicled from boyhood through training, to the battle for Iwo Jima itself. After the flag raising, the lives of those who survived the battle are explored, with an emphasis on how &quot;The Photograph&quot; changed their lives.  Unfortunately, the change was not for the better - each had difficulty with the label &quot;hero&quot; throust upon them.  Bradley's book eloquently communicates the depths of emotion between fighting men, and the tremendous sacrifice the Marines and sailors made at Iwo Jima. Repeatedly the survivng flag raisers are quoted that &quot;they are not heroes,&quot; that &quot;the real heroes never returned from Iwo Jima.&quot;  After reading Bradley's novel, I am convinced that no one who fought there ever really returned.  And that in spite of their denials, those men (and all those who served in WWII) are heroes.  Few books have moved me to tears. This book has. I highly recommend it.	2000-12-30

There he becomes apprenticed to a local shaman who teaches Pretchel much about indigenous Mayan life, and about life in general.<br />Pretchel writes that we are all part of our indigenous, pre-industrial, &quot;primitive&quot; past, we only have to search to find our roots, as he has done. The story of his awakening awareness of the natural world around us to me was more interesting. Pretchel points out that something valuable has been lost though our lack of deep cultural and familial ties to the physical world. After reading this book, I am convinced he is right.<br />The book is an easy read, and while a little slow at first, it rapidly becomes more interesting as Pretchel becomes increasingly aware of his ties to the natural world, thanks to the assistance of his Mayan mentor, a shaman. As in life, the joy of this book is not so much in the ending, as in the journey itself.	2000-12-30

If I were stranded on a desert isle, this is one of the books I would want with me.  The story is essentially about a woman who leaves her husband for another man, only to come to a tragic end.  Yet the main character is not really Anna, but Kostya Levin, almost the antithesis of Anna.  And it is this polarization of characters that is one of the sublime features of this novel.<br />The characters themselves are especially an element that engrossed me.  While there are a dizzying number of personalities, each lives &quot;outside&quot; of the story as well as within it - that is to say, even the most minor of characters seems to have a life of their own, only dropping in the story to play a small part before going on about their business. Each character has depth - they are much more than characitures of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evi&quot;, showing their humanity in their follies and in their decisions - for both good and evil.<br />Tolstoy has an alternative motive in Anna Karenina, though. The story has a barely perceptable religious tone to it, Tolstoy makes a moral statement about how life should be lived, and what a person's role in life should be in order to be &quot;truly happy&quot;. This is the result of an epiphany that Tolstoy experienced while writing the novel - an event that changed his life and eventually estranged him from many of his children.<br />The only problem I foresee readers having is keeping characters straight (as this translation uses names as well as patronymics - meaning &quot;the son / daughter of&quot; as in Stepan Arkadyvitch: Stepan, son of Arkady).  Individuals are referred to by name, patronymic or sometimes nickname (Kostya for Konstantin for example.)  My recommendation is to write the characters down in order to keep track of them.  With this said, I highly recommend this book - the language is beautiful, the plot is riviting, the story line although a bit moralistic is superb, and the characters are vivid and real.b, and the characters are vivid and real.	2000-12-30

If you are interested in that, I would recommend John Keegan's The First World War. However, if you want to know what it was like for the average footsolider to live, fight and die in the trenches of France and Belgium, this is the book to buy.<br />Ellis graphically describes the privations, the horrid living conditions, the food, the organization of the trenches, and the minutae of daily life that made the First World War so terrible. An entire chapter is devoted to the reality of fighting - what it was like to patrol at night, to &quot;go over the top&quot; and what happened to the casualties.<br />Of the thousands of books on WWI, this is one of the few to provide a glimpse of what the common British soldier experienced. For that, I recommend it to anyone interested in this time period.	2000-12-30

The book was bad. Really bad. Think &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; meets &quot;Gilligan's Isle&quot; as a trashy dime-store novella, and you have a feel for the story.  The only positive thing I can think to say about this horrible little book is that it is mercifully short.	2000-12-30

Zinn is a masterful writer, and his interpretation of American history will certainly shake a few people up.  This is most certainly not the &quot;Mom and apple pie&quot; history you learned in high school, where the European settlers are the good guys in white hats bringing civilization to the New World. And its about time.<br />Zinn writes from the perspective of the conquored, the small farmer, the little guy and the minority: those who have not had a voice for so long. The history is an ugly one of greed and self-serving manipulation - tongue in cheek, the things that have made America great. Zinn points out the lesser known facts about our founding fathers (they were the richest men in the colonies, with ulterior economic motivations for rebellion), about our presidents (Andrew Jackson made his claim to fame killing indians in the southeast) and about our conflicts (draft riots and draft dodgers during the civil war.)<br />This is not to say that Zinn turns history on its head. He does not.  Nor is this to say that Zinn is a subversive, attacking all that American's hold sacred. What A People's History of the United States does, is give history back to the people. It reminds us that as much as we would like to believe otherwise, America has a sordid history, and that often times the little guy got the short end of the stick.<br />The prose is easy to read, and the subject matter is interesting - espeically for those with more than a passing interest in US history. If you are easily offended, or are uncomfortable with what some call &quot;revisionist&quot; history, spare yourself the ulcer and don;t read the book.  If, however, you want to read a top - notch social history and don't mind having a few sacred cows shattered, I recommend it.	2000-12-30

Europe and Asia, Jared maintains, have a geographical edge over civilizations that developed elsewhere because these continents have a &quot;horizontal orientaiton of axes&quot; - that is to say long, broad stretches of land in various climates rather than thin, narrow axes of climates as are found in the Americas and Africa. These axes, Diamond argues created &quot;proximate factors&quot; (more domesticable animals, greater variety of food sources for example) that in turn allowed civilizations to conquor other peoples - and eventually conquor the civilizations on other continents in turn. A final critical contributing factor resulting from the orientation of axes is the susceptability and ease of the spread of disease, a factor that was undeniably a factor in the conquest of the New World.<br />At first glance, Diamond's argument seems unrefutable.  In fact when I was reading this book I was reminded of Darwin's Orgins of Species.  Indeed, he makes a good case for his position.  However, further examination raises questions.  For example, what of cultural influences?  I find it interesting that the eventual &quot;conquest&quot; of the world is almost exclusivley the result of European efforts - including the subjugation of Asia, which acording to Diamond shares the same developmental axis of Europe. Why is it that only Europe &quot;conquored&quot; the globe and not both Europe and Asia? Or why was it not Asia who eventually conquored and subjugated the Americas and Africa? What about the role of religion? Certainly a driving factor in the explosive European colonization of the world was Christianity. What of other cultural factors like competition?  In many cultures cooperation and group cohesiveness and unity is stressed rather than personal gain (in Asia as well as in the Americas.)  Yet none of these cultural mores are even mentioned in the book.<br />Diamond's argument has its merits - certainly geography has played a role in the eventual conquest of one civilization over others.  However, I believe the impact of culture, religion and weltanschauuing - one's world view - play a larger role than is given credit for. Guns, Germs and Steel is certainly an intriguing book, and is not without its strengths. However I cannot help but feel that the development of mankind is greater than mere geographic happenstance.)

Fitzpatrick has exhaustively scoured recently opened Soviet archives for material in this book, and it shows.  There is an abundance of new information here.  Fitzpatrick details urban life in 1930's Soviet Union - the daily struggles of common men and women in extraordinary circumstances are vividly portrayed: the shortages of food and clothing, the ubiquitous presence of the government, the almost feudal arrangements between social strata (party members and others who hold &quot;blat&quot; - influence) and the competition for housing as the USSR began to urbanize.  Only one chapter is devoted exclusively to the Great Purges of the late 1930's, although its silent presence is tangible just beneath the surface in much of the books subject matter.  As one would expect from a professional historian, the books primary purpose is scholarship. But a strength is Fitzpatrick's writing style which is fluid and never dull.  Be forewarned, this is not light reading.  With that said, I highly recommend it to anyone who has more than a passing interest in the Soviet Union or Russia. If you want a deeper understanding of why the USSR socially and econcomically rotted from within, this is an excellent starting place.	2000-12-29

Interesting tidbits of Ottoman culture and society form the bulk of the text along with numerous anecdotes of &quot;east meets west&quot; through Ottoman eyes. The book is loosly organized along themes: warfare, cities, conquest - these themes following a general chronology of the rise, expansion and eventual collapse of the empire.  Its primary strength is Goodwin's success in explaining the complex nature of Ottman rule - how major differences in language, race and religion were overcome and fused together for over 500 years, making the Ottoman empire a force to be reckoned with for most of its history.  The book reads like fiction with its numerous personalized tales of Ottoman rulers and pivotal events, which is both a strength and a weakness.  For those interested in a serious, scholarly history, I would look elsewhere.  However, if you are interested in a light but informative and well written synopsis on the Ottoman empire, this is the book for you.	2000-12-29

It was written in the mid - 1960's, and read like it. The dialogue, metaphors and characters were terribly dated - think Sam Spade meets Jimmy Buffet in 1965 Ft Lauderdale and you've got the picture: the chauvinism, the Hemingwayesque machismo, the budding \\"youth culture\\" and of course the tropical south Florida sunshine.  With that said, however, the book was a remarkably entertaining read. The plot twists kept me rivited to the story line (in spite of the by-now cliched characters). The occasional diatibes against the development of south Florida and the damage to the eco-system also made for entertaining asides - as well as a haunting foreshadowing of what was to come. But I think this will be my last John MacDonald novel. For my money, Randy Wayne White's south Florida sleuth \\"Doc Ford\\" is better. If you enjoy John MacDonald, you are sure to love Randy Wayne White.	2000-12-29

The result is a masterpiece, as people from all walks of life, of all ages, genders and from all parts of the country share a little about the poems moves them and why.  There are the old stand-bys of Walt Whitman, William Shakespeare and the like, but also a number of poets I was previously unaware of - and am pleased to have been introduced to them. (James Dickey's &quot;The Bee&quot;, Black Elk's &quot;Everything the Power of the world does in a circle&quot;, Nazm Hikmet's Things I Didn;t Know I Loved&quot; to mention a few.)  The poems themselves are a rich variety, given further depth and meaning from the tidbits shared by those who participated in the project.
