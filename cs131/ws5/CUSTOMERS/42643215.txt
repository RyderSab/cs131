I know why the amateur sleuth did the investigating.  That's what they do.  What I didn't understand was how everyone was so thrilled with the ideas presented by Max that they just blindly signed whatever he asked them to.  All the lawyers had left town with Selma's parents?  I kept expecting something awful to happen - total foreclosure on the town by Max's bank maybe.  Perhaps the author's saving that up for another book.	2004-05-19

I feared more Chapels.  I do keep reading Midnight Louie's adventures but the later ones aren't as much fun as the early ones.  If I'd have known I would have to read 27 books, I would never have picked up Blue Monday.	2003-08-11

I thought that this was one of the more intricate entries in this series and I enjoyed it a lot.	2002-04-29

This story reminded me a little of Mind Over Murder, the third book in the series, and a little of Murder, She Wrote.  You meet some characters and you know something's going to happen to one of them, but who?  And what?  And why?  And who's going to be the one responsible?  Yes, the editing could have been better and I would have enjoyed the book more, but I'd read it again in preference to many others out there.	2002-04-20

The overused vulgarities?  The jargonese?  The plot?  If I ever encounter this plot again, I'll put the book down.  Oh, well.  At least Holtzer didn't bump off any of her sleuth's nearest or dearest.	2002-04-05

Or Jane's in-laws?  Or if a murder doesn't actually happen until late in the book?  It's still got a mystery in it!  I liked Shelley's and Jane's gardening solutions, too!	2002-02-24

I did not particularly care for the ending; it's happened too often in too many series recently.  I'd still recommend this book and the series.	2002-01-17

Nothing happens that shouldn't; everything that should happen, does.  This is one of the best first books that I've read.  There is an inevitability to events, but it's not routine.  It's just the way things should be.	2001-09-09

The mystery part of this book was pretty good, but the torn-between two (almost) lovers part was just lame.  Maybe it's time for the Grandmother of All Female PIs to consider retiring to the rocking chair on the porch.	2001-09-09

The plot of this book was interesting enough, but I was left wondering why Kinsey Milhone was so incurious about her own family.  If part of her name is all over the place, why didn't she have any information at all about them?  And then to have one of her cousins turn into a dea ex machina?  How convenient.	2001-09-09

Well I've read everything in the bookstore so might as well give this a try. Hmm. Hey!  This is good! I like this book!  Wonder if this guy is going to write any more?  I'm so glad he did - Robert Crais is very very good.  Read this book and the next and the next and see if you don't think so, too!	2001-09-09

A problem in many historical novels (call this a mystery, I cannot) is that the characters act too contemporary for the time period.  I would have preferred that to Ursula's turning in to a &quot;Had I But Known&quot; gothic heroine.  And what's with the missing two years at the end?  I'll probably never know because I certainly won't be looking for any future entries in this series.	2001-08-20
