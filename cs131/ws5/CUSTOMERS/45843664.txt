First, the style is very insipid with the author constantly making sanguine comments on historical figures, as if he was gossiping with friends about the \\"National Inquirer\\". Second, his research is weak. There are but a handful of references in the bibliography showing that the author's reach for primary research is short. And finally, he uses a poor pattern in trying to tie the East with the West, rather than attempting to keep the western kingdoms in the fringes and focus on the foreground of the book, the Byzantine Empire. In all, a weak and flat book.	2005-07-26

His tendency to hesitate on decisions and his considerable aloofness turn out to be his greater allies. Manuel is the behind-the-scenes character, following events in the lowly suburbs of Madrid, coyly eyewitnessing the tension and survival among wanton groups. <br /> <br />Baroja's work earmarks an era of historical disaster in the fading Spanish empire following the 1898 defeat to the emerging American empire. His story cranks the volume of the agonizing voices of helpless creatures underlining the scope of social and political disaster.	2004-11-20

Cela tries to demonstrate and emphasize his virtues as a sarcasm scholar, but instead immortalizes the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in much the same way Sergio Leoni terrorized Clint Eastwood's early film career.<br />The author rambles on crossroad villains, murderous prostitutes and countless alien characters in a hodgepodge of virtual repetitive nonsense. His caricaturesque obsession with violence and voluminosity of odd sexuality is of incurable puberty proportions; likely the postscript of a young man frustrated with a generation constantly castigated and chastened by tenebrous forces.	2003-05-28

Mr. Escartín's style is bold and bereft of writing delicacies, but offers a view of the game unbeknownst to the perennial fan. His occurrences before and after select WC games whether with FIFA officials, retired players, gambling businessmen, or skeptical members of the world press are dotted in a most entertaining fashion.<br />Don Pedro's direct participation and involvement in all World Cup finals since 1934 until 1986 earmark a résumé that ranges from such lopsided eras as Jules Rimet's demure and romantic endeavor to catapult soccer into the center of the sporting universe to Joao Havelange's tyrannical travesty of producing a corporation out of soccer and shareholders out of its players.<br />A career that included officiating the England - Italy friendly of 1948 (the most awaited football match since the end of WWII), pumping the anxious ears of fans with a unique perspective as a dynamic journalist, coaching Spain to qualification for the 1962 WC in Chile, and eventually becoming an honorary member of FIFA has weaved an enviable fabric of commitments, achievements, acquaintances and dreams come true.<br />His death as a nonagenarian in 1998 remained unnoticed by the majority of sport fans in Spain; to the very end, a victim of his own obsessive anonymity.	2003-01-05

However, I was expecting a little more luster in the decoration of his plot by means of exploiting verticality on his characters.<br />Izzat, the only son of a Ain, an elderly yet attractive widow, deals with the ebb and flow of life, its lurking circumstances and philosophical dilemmas. Yet, Mahfouz seems to rush the story without pumping climactic scenes. The wanton killing of Yusuf Radi and the misterious political disappearance of Samir, Izzat's son, come to mind. The narrative is pure and exquisite, but the preparation of scenes and the plot's backbone lack weight.<br />The title itself, &quot;The Coveted Wife&quot; puzzled me as to who Mahfouz attributes it to. Is the author referring to Ain, a highly desired woman in spite of her ripe age, or to beautiful and young Badriyya, married to Hamdun, Izzat's best friend?

A brat on the court and an insightful analyst behind it, Johnny Mac endorses tennis fans with a rare perspective of his life unveiling some truths, but attempting to eradicate those dark dots in his life in a self-righteous fashion.<br />Honesty fuels good biographies; objectivity rattles them. McEnroe offers the former, but true to his principles, repudiates the latter. His admiration for Borg, his disdain for Connors, his arrogance for up-and-coming players, his passion for Davis Cup competition, his addiction to controversy are all illustrated in a book churned by his unparalleled idiom.<br />Yet, his conspicuous bravado backfires on him one too many times. Rather than apologizing, McEnroe expects answers from the likes of Girulaitis and Ashe. Rather than admitting his own share of faults on a relationship that failed because of clashing egos, Tatum O'Neal and her genealogical tree are the evil empire. Rather than trying to understand Lendl's or Connors' different personalities, he bad-mouths them imperviously.<br />However, John McEnroe does attain one peculiar feat. He harnesses the various dilemmas presented in his book in much the same way he picked up an argument with a chair umpire or negotiated a long rally with the \\"robotic\\" Ivan Lendl. He writes a great biography and he does it in his own terms.	2002-09-23

His western voice transports deeds of a radicalized people to the ears of those much too unfamiliar with a nation caught between the Bosporus and Anatolia, misunderstood, unwanted, feared and mistrusted by Europeans and Asians alike.<br />Perhaps, it is in the pages describing the political, military and religious institutions spawned from the Porte that Lord Kinross reaches the zenith of his book. In it, the reader can grasp some of the factors motivating the Ottomans' crave for assassinating brothers to protect uninterrupted lineage, impaling infidels or decapitating prisoners for sport.<br />&quot;The Ottoman Centuries&quot; is a good companion for those fond of sophomoric Turkish History 101 survey courses, but lacks the punch line to convince history scholars.	2002-09-11

I was expecting the best of Hemingway's descriptiveness and Cela's ingenuity rolled into &quot;The Enigma of Arrival.&quot; Instead, the author delineates the parallels experienced in his tropical childhood, some borish English acquaintances and an uncelebrated De Chirico painting.<br />Notwithstanding his extravagant and lethargic plot, Naipaul does display a divine ability to graphically adorn his pages using a crisp and succint narrative. He draws out a map of bountiful trees laid geometrically and described poetically, yet bemuses his readers with arcane episodes in vague environments.<br />A book in which a refined and educated young man experiences a world he knew too well... in the books he had read (&quot;I was like a man entering the world of a novel, a book; entering the real world&quot;), Naipaul's autobiography is too personal a testimony to which only a few can feel receptive or entertained.	2002-07-02

The depth of characters and their detailed profiles enlighten the plot of the storyline whether from the sanguine and avaricious Godoy, the machiavellian and vulnerable Queen Maria Luisa de Parma or the somewhat fictionalized Duchess of Alba.<br />Feuchtwanger succeeds in placing the Aragonese master in the midst of a carnivorous environment, surrounded by political hyenas, religious zealots, dependent relatives, and outlandish manipulators. He draws his involvement in painting the foreground of political power, the suspicions of Queen Maria Luisa and the arrogance of Godoy.<br />He suspends Goya in a perilous period of Spanish and European history: the decline of the ancient regime and the advent of the Napoleonic order. He fabricates in Goya a historical witness of Madrid, Cadiz and Zaragoza, like a Robert Capa in the beaches of Normandy. There the author borrows the painter's brush to immortalize the crux of graphic scenes with his etchings and drawings, ceaselessly warding off the frustrations of deafness and its seal of social degradation, and instill hyperrealism in the vivid colors of his canvases. <br />It stuck me as pioneering the style employed by the author to sketch chapters based on some of Goya's most renowned paintings (\\"The Family of Carlos IV,\\" \\"The Nude Maja,\\" \\"Portrait of Godoy,\\" and \\"Queen Maria Luisa Wearing a Mantilla\\"), albeit leaving off, arguably the finest of his masterpieces, \\"The Third of May.\\" In retrospect, he makes Goya the ambassador of truth, the eye of the beholder.	2002-05-30

In an autobiographical sketch, his book places the generation of those of us born between 1965 and 1970 under the microscope. It dissects our anxieties, our emotions, our desires, our goals, our strengths, our weaknesses and our libidos.<br />\\"Matando dinosaurios con tirachinas\\" (\\"Killing Dinosaurs With a Slingshot\\") MUST be translated to English. Maestre's highlights are characteristic in one too many societies bereft of profound identities, constantly forced to borrow unsung heroes as role models and neutralized by the mercurial resourcefulness of Generation Xers and the ubiquitous clout of Baby Boomers.<br />Pedro Maestre is the architect of a unique style, a blend of relentless spontaneity and dashing honesty. His 220 pages of narrative lack any punctuation periods, fail to confuse the reader in the process and manage to harness the crux of his thesis. A remarkable literary deed!	2002-04-06

Books	5	21	23	N	N	History that Reads Like a Stephen King Novel	As part of Adolf Hitler's nihilistic resolution to decimate all traces of his infamous conquests and satanic occupations, Paris was to turn into a victim of Warsaw proportions. Lapierre and Collins masterfully direct the reader to the grueling scenario Generalfeldmarschall Dietricht von Choltitz had to endure: a German army turned decadent from Parisian amenities; allied troops slowly filling in the fringes of the French capital; and most importantly, Hitler's irreversible obsession to obliterate le Champs Elysées, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the perennial scars of European history.<br />Hopscotching between enemy lines, the authors draw the nauseating political picture of Paris during August of 1944 with Resistance militias and FFI agents vying for eventual supremacy, de Gaulle battling against time and the insensitive Eisenhower to avoid internal military strife and eventual Communist hegemony, and Wehrmacht officers contemplating the insurmountable fate of the City of Lights. They also explain in detail the military background of the liberation of northwest France and the strategic and political dilemma facing the Supreme Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces: chasing after the subdued German army all the way to the Rhine or liberating a Paris overshadowed by the hammer and the sickle.<br />\\"Is Paris Burning?\\" is superbly documented, intelligently written, and scrutinizingly researched. The real accounts of heroes and antiheroes, mothers and sons, Fascists and Communists, French and German alike are spellbinding and Homeric.	2002-04-06

Sir Walter amends the Plantagenet annals by glorifying Richard the Lionhearted and defaming the popularity of his brother John while invigorating the roles of Robin of Locksley, the Knights of the Templar and other flesh-and-blood characters in the story. The Scottish novelist draws Wilfred of Ivanhoe in a stealthy role making him step in unexpectedly on impromptu stages, thus abating a conventional and exaggerated portrait of the central hero.<br />In addition, Scott tailors the plot around 12th century England's knight jousts, castle battles and courtly love scenes by accentuating antagonisms between Saxons and Normans and expressing the ever-prevalent medieval anti-Judaism. The style is immeasurably gay and seething, Scott mastering a gargantuan vocabulary and juggling with a labyrinth of episodes and characters that underline his virtuosity as a storyteller.	2002-02-16

The poetic narrative of legendary games such as 1970's Italy vs West Germany or 1982's West Germany vs France is almost Nobel Prize material.<br />However, his British twist is conspicuously ubiquitous in the form of inflating paragraphs about obscure Scottish and Welsh footballers that most international soccer hounds don't know or care about... or in lambasting on Maradona time and time again!

He risked his life believing in what was best for his country without an ounce of hesitation. He enjoyed taking chances and learned from each flight to prepare him better for the next.<br />On top of all that, General Yeager is a patient, hard-working, honest, charismatic, altruistic, relentless, loving, humorous, and controversy-free man. The anecdotes shared with Glennis Yeager and those of colleagues and friends help sharpen the description of facts and sprinkle humor.<br />He is the true father of modern aviation.	2002-02-06

In a most authentic and self-bred style, he narrates the mysteries and abuses taking place in convents and nunneries, haciendas and palaces; and underlines the influence of women in a society relentlessly dominated by \\"Don Juanism\\" and sternly regulated and probed by an over-zealous Catholic church.<br />A book tough to research and tougher to write, \\"Daughters of the Conquistadores\\" is fun to read, bare of profound insights and laden with satyrical, albeit tragic, anecdotes.	2002-01-03

His masterpiece is as neatly carved in its in-depth research and artful writing as any of Michellangelo's statuary. The overall set of tribulations the Florentine master had to endure makes him double the genius he has been attributed by art scholars.<br />The book is also a magnificent ensemble of facts and personalities studiously profiled and narrated. The gargantuan list of Michelangelo's artistic endeavors, the rhythm and balance of his fateful trail through the eyes of nine popes and miscellaneous noblemen justify Buonarroti's cantankerous, fickle and cynical demeanor.<br />Irving Stone cultivates the argument that Michelangelo's main implements as an artist were not hammer and chisel, but his pride, industry, survival instincts and perseverance. His awareness that his, and only his, prerogative was the essential element to see through the Genesis vault, Julius II's tomb or St. Peter's dome allowed humanity to witness and cherish the grandiosity of his genius.<br />Stone's overall personalization of Michelangelo is somewhat romanticized to inject pulp into the heart of the novel. However, this very technique also enhances the parallel of his relationships and underlines the core of his existence in a century rightly prophesied by Savanarola as one of pervasiveness, treachery and hedonism.<br />A caveat to those of you who have seen Carol Reed's film and would like to read this novel: there are very few ties between movie and book. The picture only takes you to the chapter entitled &quot;The Pope&quot; and even then the set of events is drastically inconsistent between paper and reel. The Michelangelo portrayed by Charlton Heston is less submissive, more handsome and equally unpredictable than the one drawn by Mr. Stone.	2001-12-12

It picks up history turns it into a minor degree of fiction to enhance realism and drama and culminates it with the infamous bombing operation, openly argued as the lab and crucible of the European war and a preface of events to come in Warsaw, Rotterdam, Pearl Harbor, Dresden and Tokyo.<br />The use of primary accounts by motley eyewitnesses absorbs the reader into an increasingly suspenseful pace. A restaurant owner, a manufacturer of weapons, a liberal priest, a radical Republican officer and an empathetic nun-turned-into-nurse make up a most credible, yet unconventional &quot;dramatis personae.&quot;<br />The book also provides a generous and abundant narration on the evolution of the strategic buildup of the mission, the tense politics between German pilots and Spanish Francoist officers, the military background in the Basque valleys and villages, and the depiction of Erwin Von Richtofen (cousin of the highly decorated and ultimately fallen Red Baron) as the mastermind of the raid.

Mr. Hughes' trade is not particularly conciseness, so his book spits out a plethora of events, politicians, noblemen, artists, anarchists, &quot;casas&quot;, churches, and annecdotes that will overwhelm the reader. &quot;Barcelona&quot; was written for both the scholar and world-trotter (not that one who will pop in for a brief layover, though.) The art history chapters, specially those depicting the excessively ornamented Modernistic architecture, teem with ornate descriptions, yet Mr. Hughes provides us with poor, small, and black and white photographs incapable of accompanying the writer's flow.

At times it appeared like Europe was going to implode, rather than explode during the reigns of some of these powerless rulers; and it was thanks to Ottonians, Capetians and Northern Spanish monarchs that Europe did attain a permanent &quot;forging&quot;.	2001-08-23

Just finished the fourth of this magical saga of adventures and I cannot wait to purchase the next couple of tomes! Once again suspense crawls with a slow and patient pace, characters are resuscitated from Velzquez's canvases, the narrative borrows conspicuously Cervantine sketches, and the action episodes sprawl spontaneously with diminutely described fencing and brawling scenes. Do Prez-Reverte's books get published in English? Such Spielbergesque epic is worth its circulation in one too many a tongue.	2001-08-14

I completely got excited at the relationship between grandfather and grandchild, their quiet, yet boundless chemistry. There are fewer granddads left like him, honorable, proud, vain, corteous, charming, humorous, altruistic and bragging of the winnings of years past. The book itself is a realistic signature of generational relationships.	2001-07-20

Ivo Andric masterfully collects pivotal traits of the Yugoslav people through centuries of occupation by Ottomans and Austrians. He grasps the crux of today's challenges in the Balkans: the scars by invaders and the thirst for national and even personal identity. I recommend every US government foreign services official and every NATO officer to read this book. I would also hope they'd understand it.	2001-07-09

However, the authors (er journalists) cannot seem to be able to shake off that eternal of vices among the media: subjectivity. The profiles on such personalities as Schrempp and Stallkamp are riveting. However, former Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca gets clubbered. I never fell in love with the guy, but they make him look like a pimp ready to beat up one of his girls.<br />In all, the book carries itself superbly, like a thriller, but ultimately fails to make its mark: that Daimler Benz bought out Chrysler flat and simple and that the American automaker's employees were in for the biggest roller-coaster of their lives. I don't think much can be said about Bob Eaton. He is the icon of corporate America: get out of the way little people I am jumping on my golden parachute.	2001-06-28

I keep marvelling at Mr. Prez-Reverte's enviable style and lexicon. Yet another gem of a novel with microscopically researched historical footnotes. However, it looks at times like Iigo Balboa is kicking Diego Alatriste out of the limelight. This is the first of the books I have read on the series where the young squire is coming of age and eventually coming into stage. He is the narrator, but also the executor of pivotal scenes. Regardless of this meaningless observation, the book is fascinating - yet again. The afterword puzzled me for nights. The editor describes the history of Diego Velzquez's &quot;Surrender of Breda&quot;, one of the greatest - if not the greatest - painting of the Baroque period. In it he points out that perennial idiosyncracy of the Sevilian master, namely, redoing his canvas with different scenes or even characters. Was the explanation about Velzquez's self-portrait, perched on the left side along the defeated Dutch army, truly accurate, i.e., was Alatriste originally portrayed in its place? Or is the afterword part of the novel's unconventional fictionalization?	2001-06-19

I got this first series book one year after I received &quot;Limpieza de sangre&quot; and &quot;El oro del rey&quot; as Christmas presents. Fortunately, I kept them on my bookshelf's long waiting list before I decided to read &quot;Las aventuras del capitan Alatriste&quot;. A piece of advice: read these books sequentially even though each story is a different adventure. Such characters as Gualterio Mallatesta and Luis de Alquezar get hopscotched in key episodes and knowking their backgrounds is necessary in not getting out of track. The writing is exquisite, melodic, fun, rich and succint. I view the sociological psyche of the average character as the most interesting aspect, specifically the mindsets of 17th century Spanish swashbuckling fortune-hunters, Inquisition officers, mercenaries and poets. The inclusion of renowned Spanish dramatist and poet Francisco de Quevedo is tantamount to sprinkling saphron to paella. It colorizes the story line with necessary chunks of humor. Mr Perez-Reverte's prose is laden with an enviable lexicon that approximates the reader to the reign of Phillip IV without completely abandoning that one of Juan Carlos I.	2001-05-13

Each book builds more suspense than the previous one read. &quot;Limpieza de sangre&quot; depicts milestone features about life in Spain in the first quarter of the 17th century. Without digressing too much into the social and political quagmires affecting the court of Phillip IV and his infamous, yet resourceful, prime minister Conde Duque de Olivares, Mr. Perez-Reverte's pen takes us to another nail-biting plot involving the Spanish Inquisition. His narrative is once again meticulously labored and his characters are produced quite graphically. His sense of detail is both powerful and realistic.	2001-05-13

Suspense keeps building up, but then it dissolves. After reading a couple of these stories one gets a hold of the trend and expects no suspense breaking. A few tales later the book becomes obviously boring.	2001-04-05

The realism and power behind this book are electrical. Graves' coolness in the trenches while composing sonnets and seeking a blissful state of mind is almost disturbing when contrasting it with the demonic state of destruction and death. His unnerving pace and tranquil descriptions seem to underline an innocence lost in years past.	2001-03-28

Some of these &quot;decoration&quot; books do contain excellent write ups. Ignoring Mr. Kitchen's dissertation on the history of Germany would be at your own peril if you own the book already and, except for martini stains and dust, choose to ignore it. This history of Germany explains in a fascinatingly succint style key aspects of the German nation and German ethos: the Holy Roman Empire, the Hanseatic League, the Reformation, the Industrial Revolution and, inevitably, the Third Reich and the Holocaust. There are excellent art and culture sections describing anything from Goethe's Romantic world and the Grimm Brothers' fantastic tales to the Bauhaus. If you want to own a book to impress your friends, buy it, but buy it mostly to be impressed by it.	2001-03-13

The book is downright brilliant; it is history, but reads like a novel. The prose is colorful and exquisitely worded. Yet two aspects sort of got me thinking: (a) the almost detachment of Thomas More during the course of passing the Act of Succession and (b) the lack of evidence on Anne Boleyn's adultery case. If I had to bestow a description to each queen, I would call Katherine of Aragn the most virtuous, Anne Boleyn the most dangerous, Jane Seymour the most fulfilling, Anne of Cleves the most pragmatic, Katherine Howard the most reckless and Katherine Parr as the most universal. In all, a masterful job.	2001-03-05

Pride because this novel is a jewel in Spanish literature and shame because it took me 34 years of my life to finally command myself to enjoying Garca Mrquez's masterpiece. The author's ability to build characters is amazing, his prose is elegant and his descriptive technique knows no match. The plot is fascinating, although the abundance of Aureliano Buenda characters triggers a great deal of confusion. The storyline follows a conspicuous Spanish American tradition of semi-surrealistic themes mixing realism and symbolism in order to neutralize simplicity.	2001-02-21

Gifted and popular, yet profligatious and opportunistic, Maradona, argues Burns, is the victim of a set of extremely abussive environments. Constantly surrounded and invaded by manipulative club executives, mafia leaders and &quot;yellow press&quot; journalists, the Argentinian idol leads two different trails in life: to posterity in the Pantheon of the soccer gods... and to the depths of personal chaos.<br />The book may have very easily been entitled &quot;Man Without Trusting Friends&quot; and it could rightly be cataloged as either a sports biography or a sociological treatise. Burns' composure and objectivity throughout the book are downright professional. His writing is elegant, muscular and enjoyable.	2001-02-08

The characters are exquisitely molded into poor wretches, intransigent manipulators, neurotic business owners, garrulous salesmen, diffident bourgeois and aloof poets. The synergy is powerful because of its contrasts: each a survivor of the war and condemned to lead an egregious life. However, Cela's main theme is not just survival or improvisation, but imagination. The cafe dwellers are mostly penniless intellectuals hoping to trade a labored sonnet for a cup of coffee; or forlorn creatures longing for lost (and never-known) ones. An admiral of modern Spanish literature, Cela is a nobel prize laureate.	2001-01-23

The author's first-hand accounts of Don Juan of Borbon in Rome, Estoril and Lausanne are unique and fascinating. His views on the Franco regime are rather subjective and biased, but relevant in substantiating his principal arguments. Mr. Pedro Sainz Rodrguez's political feats are fascinating, but perhaps exaggerated. I would exhort Mr. Anson to put together a biography about this obscure, humorous and genious of a man.	2001-01-15

Whereas Shakespeare stresses Henry's prowess as a soldier and a hero, Allmand throws in unbeknownst traits: goal-oriented business planner, egalitarian political strategist, tireless academician, merciless warrior and fearing christian. Even though Mr. Allmand's prose teems with passive verbs and endless sentences, sometimes puzzling and even confusing the reader, his book is one of its kind.	2001-01-10
