Where's the Cradle?	\\"Cats Cradle\\" tells of the story of a man simply setting out to write a book about the atomic bomb. From this simple objective, our hero finds himself thrown into a world of dwarfs, banana republics, Hoosiers, scientists, and one secret formula called Ice-9. The plot is a wild one, but the theme remains constant as Vonnegut pits science against religion in a no holds cage match. In the end, our hero barely survives both as Vonnegut seemingly thumbs his nose at the rest of the world.     \\"Cats Cradle\\" reminds me of Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", both books speak in powerful ways to youthful angst and both tend to grow and develop with their audience. There's no protagonist like Holden Caulfield here (a youthful soul most readers related to strongly) but there are a number of characters that represent the worst society has to offer, characters we see each night on the news. The book starts with \\"Cradle's\\" protagonist, Jonah, coming up against a guarded and cynical scientist who in turn leads him to the three children of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, inventor of the nuclear bomb. Each of Hoenikker's kids, now grown, have some of their father's last experiment Ice-9, a chemical, which freezes all fluids on contact. A small amount could freeze the planet we learn, this while the Hoenikker siblings are running around the globe, each with their tiny thermos of Ice-9, the very future of the world in their incapable hands.  The trail of the sibling's flows to San Lorenzo, a small island, that is responsible for the creation of Bokonism...a religion based on lies. It is here where Ice-9 and Bokonism go head to head and the results are devastating.     Of course Vonnegut's true villain in all this is man and his incredible talent of making wondrous things, be it through God or test tubes, that are very good at destroying us.	2005-09-23

And I agree with fellow reviewers that it is quite amazing that someone could write a book about salt that spans well over 400 pages. However, the book is bogged down by these facts far too often, unless your chef and/or  really love detailed history, the read will slow for most.  <br /> <br />\\"Salt\\" is an ambitious book which chronicles salt from the dawn of human civilization to contemporary times. Broken into three sections, \\"Salt\\" starts with the importance of salt to our bodies as well as for preservation of food, mummies, etc., taking us from the dawn of man to the dawn of exploration. Part two explores salt as an international commodity and it's importance in the development of North America. While part 3 delves into the research and politics of salt with in the last 100 years or so.  <br /> <br />Filled with many interesting nuggets of info that keeps you wanting more \\"Salt\\" is not a bad read it's just that those nuggets are too few and too far in-between for my taste.	2005-09-13
US	32095190	RKJHYDIXBX8VL	0446577081	734490734	Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A short but informative read.	These are confusing times. There is so much information and misinformation out there about the mid-east that's it hard to keep everything in perspective. That's why I liked Carmen Bin Ladin's book; she brings forth a slightly different view on the mid-east and on Saudi Arabia.     It's a short easy read that has you wanting more, but it's also a read that's refreshing in that the author does not ask for our pity. Carmen could have spent the whole book whining and asking us to feel sorry for her. She could of sounded like a spoiled rich girl who got in over her head, but this book is not about ego. This book is mostly about fundamentalist thought in Saudi Arabia and how it is not only fueling a holy war with the west but how it is also suppressing half it's population (the female half) by imposing obscene restrictions which endanger women.    Carmen Bin Ladin, like many beautiful smart women, fell for a charming attractive man who later turned against her and her children. Her husband was from a rich family in Saudi Arabia, the Bin Ladins. At first only the marriage was to take place in Saudi Arabia, but soon she is living in the country with her husband during the oil boom of the 1970's. Carmen pinpoints her troubles, all of our troubles really, to the fundamentalist movement in 1979 and the fall of Iran to radical students. As the Iranian movement spread through the Mid-east, a conservation Saudi Arabia  becomes fundamentally conservative. Carmen with two little girls could see the writing on the wall. In a country where women have no rights, no say, no power...the lives of her children become threaten.    Another disturbing theme that runs the course of the book is Carmen's descriptions of the Saudis. If she is right, we face a tremendous threat not from Iraq, Syria, or Iran, but from a country where arrogance reins supreme, children are taught to hate in school, and an anti-west attitude fuels aggression and terrorism. It's no fluke that her brother in law Osama,is a Saudi and I believe her when she says that when Osama dies... thousands are ready to take his place. It is an ominous sign.    I recommend \\"Nine Parts of Desire : The Hidden World of Islamic Women\\" by Geraldine Brooks as a companion piece to this book. It goes into greater detail than \\"Inside the Kingdom\\" and is slightly more satisfying.	2005-08-29
US	32095190	R2KHRY00VMQTT3	0380978946	282659637	Olympos	Books	4	3	8	N	N	A strong sequel, even if it is a little bloated.	The Greeks and Trojans have stopped fighting each other and started fighting the gods of Mt.Olympus, the pampered \\"child like\\" remnants of our future earth have just bitten the hand of their master and are now surviving day by day...fighting off the very robots that once served them, a fictional monster has taken over Paris and is preparing to eat the world, and robots from the outer ice planets are making their way to earth to stop the universe from imploding. Take a breath and welcome to the sequel of Ilium, a multi-storied arch that juggles so many concepts and so many plot lines that some kind of a Cliff note bundle should be included.    Dan Simmons uses his formula from Hyperion, of combining classical literature with contemporary science fiction. The result is a sort of Homer/Shakespeare/Asimov hybrid. Simmons dives into the Illid, the Odyssey, and the Tempest, twisting those tales in a way that makes them come alive, quite literally. The reader doesn't have to know those works well, but it helps since we deal with nearly all of the characters from these classic tales. How do these books come to life? The answer to that one sort of makes sense, it's how they ended up threatening  existence that had me constantly retracting my thoughts as I read the book.    There are a few other problems as well, not only does Simmons get a little self-indulgent with the classical lit. origins, it also gets a little long. For me the book dragged in the middle and had moments, even during the end, where I found myself skimming. I could have done with about 100 less pages. The ending does wrap most things up, but I was left to make some leaps of faith when it came to certain characters and situations. Much like other Dan Simmons Sci-Fi I felt that I only got about 95% of what happened. Still I don't mind that missing 5%. In the end, this is a very good book. A book that I plan to re-read and hopefully gain an even deeper understanding of these truly inventive stories. I'd rather scratch my head a little than to have a book that tries to be everything to every body.    If your looking for an easy read, pass on Simmons. If your looking for an exciting read that may take a little work...take a week off, sit back and enjoy Ilium and Olympos.	2005-08-24

By the end of the book it seemed clear, \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" is a book that is in transition. Now before you reach for \\"This Review was Not Helpful\\" button allow me to explain my views.     The plot of book 6 centers around a mysterious potion book by a mysterious author that Harry and company try to deduce the identity to. All the while people within Hogwarts are being attacked by dark curses. The plot to book 2, \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" centers around a mysterious diary by a mysterious author that Harry and company try to deduce the identity to. All the while people within Hogwarts are being attacked by a dark curse. In book 5, it ends with the death of a popular character. In book 6, it ends with the death of a popular character. The good news is that J.K. Rowling's writing still flows with imagination.  In fact most of the book seems like a look back at books 1 through 6 as we're introduced (all be it sometimes briefly) to nearly every past character that Rowling has created. It's as if Rowling is reminding us of all that has happened and who is important for the seventh and finale book.    I do and have always enjoyed the development of Harry. In book six he is more mature, a little wiser, and finally gets a girlfriend. Though he is still making some oblivious mistakes that maybe he should of grown out of a year or two ago.    SPOILER:  The ending makes the book sing but still leaves many questions unanswered. Is Snape really evil, I doubt it. Is Dumbledore really dead, I don't think so. And if I'm right, is book seven going to end up being too predictable?   SPOLIER OVER:    As an individual book, the story falls short and deserves 3 stars. However, as part of this series, it works quite well and deserves 4 stars. The average of the score falls somewhere in between. So let the negative reviews of this review begin...now.	2005-08-01

Thanks to Food Network, Iron Chef, Hells Kitchen and, of course, Bourdain's book, it's hard not to escape this latest fad.  Anthony Bourdain was one of the first to ride this craze with his book \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". In it Bourdain paints himself as a sort of Lou Reed and Keith Richards love child who cooks and despite being a massive \\"f@*! up\\", secures his fame as the head chef at a popular New York restaurant. Bourdain starts with his youth and his love for French food. He works from the ground floor up, in little local restaurants and then with an education at the C.I.A. in New York (the culinary school, not the spy agency).  <br /> <br />After graduation Bourdain chases the all mighty dollar from one needy restaurant to the next. He also chases the dragon and while other chefs around rise to the top like perfect souffls...Bourdain sinks slowly to the bottom and almost ends up super sizing orders. The book is more than his rise and fall and eventual rise, it's also about how restaurants work, and how good food is prepared as well the kitchen culture that can so defined an establishment. <br /> <br />Bourdain is not a great writer, but he is a good one. Some of the chapters seem a bit jumbled and even a tad long, but the book does come together. Bourdain is selling us his world and it's a world that's fascinating to behold.	2005-07-27
US	32095190	R24Y3GUGD315PB	1579621104	84950756	Callgirl	Books	3	9	12	N	N	A Good Primer, but Doesn't Answear All Questions 3 1/2 Stars	Jeannette Angell was a college Sociology teacher in Boston reeling from a bad and broken up relationship. Low on money and deep in debt she turns to an escort service to supplement her income. Over the course of the next few years she becomes a successful prostitute with a string of regulars and dual roles as both a teacher and call girl. This leaves her not only exhausted but in question of the direction of her life.    Angell paints, what seems to me, to be a very accurate picture of the escort business. The competition between girls for clients, the idea of sex reduced to nothing more exciting than a timecard being punched, and the hazards of drugs and violent men. This is not a book that titillates, nor should it be. As a sociologist Angell has experience with examining social systems and institutions. She's able to bring her skills to this book, which tries to clarify the world of prostitution.     Unfortunately Angell is too close to her subject. She's unable to provide an objective view. Whether this makes the book better or worse is debatable but as I read the book I was surprised at the number of highly educated, intelligent women involved in prostitution who where making very stupid decisions. Why does a beautiful blonde with kids and a master degree in chemistry transport drugs while on the job? Getting busted for solicitation is problematic, getting busted for drug trafficking is 10 to 20. Why does the sexy Asian call girl (who speaks a half dozen languages and could easily have a career in international business) fall in love with a crack pipe more than the idea of a happy life? Or why would a college teacher first turn to prostitution to raise some cash?  Is \\"higher class\\" prostitution an occupation for beautiful smart people who can't make good life decisions? Is it a thrill? Or is it simply a job that provides an easy way out of financial troubles? Angell never makes a conclusive statement on this, she does allude to the fact that with out legalization, the job is extremely hazardous; but I kept coming back to this question...\\"Why do smart women make bad decisions?\\"    Over Angell's tenure as a call girl, she is raped, almost arrested, and nearly develops a drug habit. Her moonlighting ironically does make her a more popular teacher. She ends up creating a course on prostitution, which is warmly received and elevates her academic position. However, we never find out how she views the publication of this book in regards to her teaching career (since in the book she is constantly afraid of her secret being exposed).    In the end I wanted more conclusions drawn, maybe I expected a more linear book with a more opinionated ending. Maybe I expected Angell's introspection to unlock more of the questions I was asking myself. I liked the book, I just wanted more.	2005-06-13

I was blown away by \\"Hyperion\\". I'm patiently awaiting the sequel to \\"Illuim\\". I was haunted by \\"Song of Kali\\". So it was with no reservations that I took up \\"Summer of Night\\", a Stephen King like thriller set in a small mid-west town during the 1960's.  <br /> <br />The good news is that Simmons lives up to his reputation as one of the smartest writers around. The plot may be familiar ground, a group of boys (teetering on the edge of manhood) team up to investigate the mysterious goings on in their rural Illinois town, but the threat is  100% Dan Simmons. Looking back we're never really able to label the threat specifically, but the originals of the threat involving an ancient evil bell and the way the evil spreads from the bell to the citizens of this supposedly idyllic town is riveting.   <br /> <br />The problem rests with the pace of the book. The paperback is around 600 pages, over 300 pages too long in my opinion. Page upon page is spent in the daily lives of these young men we slowly get to know, the problem, in my opinion, is that we really don't need to know them. I didn't care about the baseball ball games that they played or the bike rides that they took. I just cared about the evil that was seeping into this town. The book has some false starts near the beginning but doesn't really take off until the last 200 pages or so. It's a shame too, because this could of been a classic had it just had a stronger editor. <br /> <br />If you like long suspense or if you enjoy the slow build up of Stephen King, check out \\"Summer of Night\\". If you want faster read with out all the fat, move on.	2005-04-25
US	32095190	R13I4CH0ECPC9T	0312328478	431022631	The Preservationist	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Moments of Genius (3 and a half stars)	I really loved parts of this book. I loved how the author, David Maine, has us look at this classic biblical tale from several different points of view. We see this tale though the eyes of Noe (Noah), his children, his wife, and his daughter-in-laws. I loved how Bera questions God's will and Ilya declares \\"only a man's god would show love for his creation by destroying it\\". I love how Noe's basically a stubborn old coot, bedding teenage girls in his five hundredth year, bargaining with giants for timber and pitch and acting almost gleeful at those perishing around him as the waters come pouring down. I loved a lot of things about this book, but for some reason I didn't love the book. <br /> <br />There are been a lot of attempts at recreating Noah's famous adventure, there was a boring movie, a dreadful mini-series and of course many books. The real trick is taking a story that last but for a few pages in the bible and turning it into an epic. Maine is ultimately successful. He is faithful to the scripture while at the same time a critic. How could a God do this to his creation? is a theme that is addressed through out the book. Noah has faith but his son's wives don't see things in such black and white terms. Maine also reminds us that we dealing with Adam's God...a God that's easily spurn. A God that makes his presence know, a God that strikes others down.  <br /> <br />For me the biggest problem with this book is that a consistent voice is impossible to hear, this is what makes the book so unique but it also makes it hard to enjoy. I loved the multiple points of view, but I hated what they were doing to the overall story.  <br /> <br />I recommend \\"The Preservationist\\", it's an excellent complement to the biblical story but for a more fanciful experience about Noah and his Ark I recommend \\"Many Waters\\" by Madeleine L'Engle the final book of the \\"Time Quartet\\" (the Wrinkle in Time Series). It's more fun than \\"Preservationist\\" but its waters aren't as deep. <br />	2005-02-10

First, this is not a horror book. There are scary moments and very disturbing actions, but this book won't have you sleeping with the lights on. Second, there is an ending to this book, maybe not the ending or closure people want... but there is an ending. Granted, loose ends exists and I found myself trying to make sense of them after the book was done, but I tend to like that in a story. Third and final, this was Dan Simmons' first book. In my opinion it's not his best, but for a first effort it's quite extraordinary. It's a smart haunting tale that sticks with you. <br /> <br />The story is about a writer given his first big break. He is to go to Calcutta and bring back the latest poem by the famous M.Das, a poet who had died several years earlier.  Bobby, our writer, travels to India with his wife and baby to obtain the manuscript and shed light on the mystery of how a supposed dead writer is still writing.  It's to be a brief trip but problems arises and the horrors of Calcutta eventually overwhelm Bobby and his family. <br /> <br />The book takes place in the 70's, and I'm assuming here, has little to do with the Calcutta of today. The city Simmons paints becomes the main character or maybe the main villain. Calcutta is a horror. It is a pit of despair and disease. It is also played as an offering to the Goddess Kali. In western literature we often have fun with our \\"devil\\", playing him as an egomaniac, a trickster, a cartoon fool, a manipulator or a beast.  After reading \\"Song of Kali\\" I am quite confident that Kali could kick our devil's shinny red butt. She is pure darkness, darkness that strikes like a cobra. Simmons uses most of his time slowly building the suspense of this book by painstaking building Bobby's contempt for Calcutta. When it reaches its zenith, odds are you will gasp; but the real ending is in the hope that Bobby and his family finds afterwards. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-07

There's an old joke about a man walking down a street. He comes across a box that simply reads \\"dead bird\\". The man, now intrigue, looks in the box, sees the dead bird and exclaims...\\"I don't know what I was expecting.\\" Such was my fate with \\"On Paradise Drive\\". <br />  <br />I knew this was a book on commentary, commentary on state of the American middle class. I assumed there wouldn't be much factual info, that it would be mostly opinion sprinkled with quotes from books, articles, etc. to support it's claims. And that is exactly what I got. The problem was, however, that I expected to either love or hate this book. If I hated it I could get some smug satisfaction from my superiority over it. Take out my frustrations by writing a nasty review. If I loved it, I would bask in being a superior person in understanding and relating to it...praising it up and down in my review. However \\"Paradise\\" makes the biggest blunder of all...it's right in the middle of the road, average. I neither loved it nor hated it; I was simply board by it. <br /> <br />The two biggest problems I had with it was that Brook's generalizes seem off and I felt like he was making the same point over and over again. I know the communities he speaks of and yes, there are \\"Ubermoms\\" and Grill Daddies but he paints them with two board a stroke. People are more diverse than the groups Brooks places them into. David Brooks makes some interesting points but in the end this book would really play  better as a series of articles over a course of time. I'd probably respond better to him better in smaller douses. (2 and a half stars) <br />	2005-02-02

The former type of authors tends to have collections that appeal to their fan base. The latter type of author is trying to do two things, create a fan base (buzz) and flex their literary mussels (prepare for their first novel). Premiere writer Daphne Kalotay's first book of short stories, I think, does both. <br /> <br />\\"Calamity and Other Stories\\" at first seems like a collection of separate shorts. We are first introduced to Rhea and Callie, two ten year girls who, together, begin to see the subtle confusing complexities of adult life. In the third story, we're introduced to Geoff, a preteen who's forced to face, head on, those complexities. In the forth story we meet Geoff's friend, Mack. By the sixth story I finally caught on, this is not so much a book of short stories as it is a fragmented novel. We follow the lives of Rhea, Mack, Geoff, Callie, plus a few others as we jump from story to story. The final chapter takes us to a wedding where the central characters all congregate in celebration. This last story caps the book nicely and even offers us a tiny sense of closure. <br /> <br />Unto themselves most of these stories seem to lack direction and conclusion, together however they cement each other and offer us a candid look at an extended family over the course of 20+ years. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-01

The book is broken up into four main parts, three of which are dedicated to diary summaries. Schlissel has broken up the chapters according to periods of time (1841-1850, 1851-1855 and 1856-1867). The final chapter is the diaries themselves, along with a map of the Over Land Trail as well as some interesting but academic charts.  <br /> <br />As a historical work \\"Women's Diaries...\\" brings as up close to the people, especially the women, who risked everything including theirs lives and the lives of their children to cross this once wild land. Pictures pepper the book of hard looking women as well as their ragged families, usually gathered  to morn their dead. I can't think of a better book to learn about the personal sacrifices of the westward migration. <br /> <br />As a book read for informative pleasure \\"Women's Diaries...\\" still works, mostly because of Schlissel's strong attachment to her work. Granted she stays removed from her feelings (as a good historian should), but the organization of this book, the pictures she uses, the entry's she highlights, shows us that she has a great passion for these woman's stories. A passion she wishes to share with us. It's not a book that everyone can or should read for pleasure, but for those who love the west, history, or woman's studies...this is an important work. <br />	2005-01-31

When I saw a copy of the book for sale I quickly snatched it up, I thought I would read it with my daughter.  <br /> <br />The thing that first surprised me about this book is that it is beautifully written. It's obvious from its prose that Ted Hughes is also a poet. The slightly sophisticated language might be too much for those under 7, but I found it refreshingly charming. <br /> <br />The second surprise was that this book had very little to do with the movie. There's an Iron Giant in the movie and book as well as a young boy...and that's about it. The theme's are the same (in that this world can be a world of peace instead of a world of violence and fear) but both approach this lesson from different directions. <br /> <br />In the book, the Iron Giant, tricked by the boy, falls into a trap set for him by fearful farmers. The farmers quickly dispose of the giant, but the giant returns and it's up to the boy again to figure out how best to deal with him. In the end the boy and giant become friends but there is a bigger threat on the horizon, a space dragon the size of Australia has come to earth and only the Iron Giant can save the planet. <br /> <br />There's a lot of deep information here for such a short children's book.  The Iron Giant (like in the movie) represents misguided fear. The space dragon can mean a number of things, but I align it with this planets habit of aggression... an aggression that threatens to consume us all. This book was written 30 years ago, but it seems timelier now than it did in the 1970's. <br />	2005-01-12

The book begins with Carter performing one of his popular show for a packed house including President Warren Harding. Carter invites the President up on stage to help in his act, moments later the President disappears. Secret Service Agents wait nervously for the President to re-appear, which he does, but late that night the President mysteriously dies and Carter the Great becomes suspect. <br /> <br />This book (though it incorporates real people and actual historical even) is not a biography. I don't even think it could be called historical fiction. It's a clever twist on historical fiction where the author ties several important historical events (Harding's death, the invention of TV, and Houdini) to Carter and his magic act. Even Charles Carter is adapted to meet the author's vision.  <br /> <br />The book also explores Carters past (or at least the author's interpretation of Carter's past). We first see when Carter becomes interested in illusion. We're with him when he takes up magic and joins a vaudeville troop. We encounter his nemesis, a hack magician consumed by jealously over Carter.  When the book catches up with Carter during the Harding investigation, we're taken for another ride as he tries to outwit the Secret Service. In the end Carter is hiding something, but it is a trick that he can never reveal. <br /> <br />\\"Carter Beats the Devil\\" is a fun and joyous ride that combines, history, melodrama, and pulp fiction into a book that celebrates the joys of stage magic and a time when even the simplest of things today was the stuff of magic yesterday. <br />	2005-01-11

The first book of both series is about travelers brought together under dark circumstances, all with a common goal. In \\"Hyperion\\" our pilgrims are on a quest to confront the Shrike, a god like being able to grant great joy and great pain. Each has a different objective and relationship with the Shrike and each knows that they may never return. In the first Hyperion book we hear each of their stories. In the second book \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" we not only see each of their confrontations with the Shrike, we are also exposed (much like in Return of the King) to a great and complex war.     The Hegemony (what I assume is a futuristic extension of a democratic earth) confronts the Ousters. The Ousters appear to be evolved humans, rejects at one point in time forced to evolve in dangerous and beautiful ways in the deep of space. The line in the sand for this war is drawn at the edge of the Hegemony, near a planet called Hyperion. As the book progress, however; we soon learn that the Ousters may be the least of humanities problems.    This is a complex series of stories. The author, Dan Simmons, goes back and forth between our pilgrims on Hyperion (and their ordeals with the Shrike) to the Ouster threat and then to a nagging feeling that there's something worst. There are also connections to be made to the first book as well. As a result, it's not always an easy read, but it is a very satisfying read. If you enjoy smart science fiction, you should give this Hyperion series a chance.	2005-01-10

Each book, though sharing the same story arc, is quite different in form. In \\"Hyperion\\" we have a sort of futurist \\"Cantebury Tales\\" where several travelers share their stories to each other as they travel to an outer planet called Hyperion. It is on this planet that they are destined to meet the Shrike, an entity that is worshipped on some planets and feared on others. All who pilgrim to this creature risk death, but each also has the chance at salvation. Legend has it that the Shrike grants one a wish, the others all die.  <br /> <br />In this first book we are introduced to the last of the Shrike pilgrims the poet, the father, the Consul, the priest, the detective, and the general.  The book is divided up into chapters describing their stories. Some are better than others but this book would be great alone just for the story of Sol the father. <br /> <br /> Like other Dan Simmon's books this is not always an easy read. Simmon's does not write down to his audience. There may be tiny parts of this book that you just don't get. Some of those answers come in the second book, some you just have to figure out on your own. If you've already read the book I recommend a second read. I am sure you'll get even more out of it. Be forewarned, this book ends on some cliff hangers, be prepared to read \\"Fall of Hyperion\\". <br />	2005-01-07

I love non-superhero books when they work, but often they become bogged down by too much dialogue. They also tend to take themselves a little to seriously. As for the writter/aritist combination, usually you get good art or a good story but not so much both. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to say however that \\"The Interman\\" eliminated those fears and gave me a well designed, enjoyable read. There were parts that were a little too dialogue heavy and this did slow down the momentum some but the overall story of a genetically enhanced cold warrior, now a CIA loose end, on the run for his life is a compelling one (even if it does tend to resemble the \\"Bourne Identity\\"). Jeff Parker's layouts and art are smart and get to the point. He maintains a good balance between word and design. The dialogue is not perfect, but like the art Parker tries to keep it simple and clear. <br /> <br />If you prefer super hero books, stick to super hero books. If you're looking for something different, give \\"The Interman\\" a try. <br />	2005-01-06

Before they knew it, the Goldstones, were not only book collectors they were beginning to seriously consider spending the \\"big bucks\\" real book collecting requires. Where once an ancient leather bound edition of Dickens had them running for the bookstore exit, by the middle of their story the Goldstones become captivated if not obsessed with such books.  <br /> <br />In terms of learning the ins and outs of book collecting, there isn't a ton of information much here. The joy of this book is following a couple that love books. From basement stores in New England to first class offices in New York, the travel from book nook to book store looking for the best deals. Like any hobby, they flirt with obsession and the real drama comes not from the books, but from the people, the other \\"book freaks\\", they meet along the way. <br /> <br />\\"Used & Rare\\" is an eye-opening look into a world of musty paper, bookworms, and great literature. <br />	2005-01-06

In his book \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" Jon Krakauer looks specifically at Mormon extremist.    When we think of Mormons today, we probably think of the moderates. The Donny and Maries who have one wife and who make those cheesy but well produced Latter Day Saint commercials. This is the majority of Mormons today, but that was not always the case. Mormons as a whole did practice polygamy and they believed that god could speak to anyone, not just popes, preachers, and priests. Krakauer sees this as the religion's main flaw. Anyone (i.e. man) can be a prophet. As a result, such a belief system has already fragmented the young church. Mormon outcast have created their own communities, taken on multiple wives again, and have begun trading their daughters out like cattle to other like minded sects. To make matters worst some men caught up in this patriarchal faith tend to abuse their position through rape and murder. Their world and faith distort equally as they justify their actions through God's will.    Jon Krakauer explores these issues as well as the origins of the Mormon faith. There's not much of a silver lining here; but if you want to explore corrupted faith... don't look to the mid-east first, look to your own backyard.	2005-01-06

Then there are books that are great to read and discuss. However \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is more of a great book to discuss.     \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a story set in an asylum in what appears to be the 1960's. The asylum is run with precessions by the female nurses and their black orderlies. The men in the asylum have all been beaten down by life. Now they are beaten down by a system implemented by their matriarch, Nurse Rachet. Along comes Randall Patrick Macmurphy, a boisterous charismatic convict, who thinks he's outwitting the system by pretending he's crazy. Over time Macmurphy becomes the inmates patriarch and ends up fighting Rachet for control. How the book ultimately ends hints at the author's cynical views on men, women and society.    The book's narrator is Chief Bromden, a half-breed Indian, who (unlike Macmurphy) is actually crazy. Understanding his train of thoughts, as he describes what is not only happening to him but to the other characters, is probably one of the more difficult things about this book. It does help to read an abbreviated version (i.e. Cliff notes) or read the book as a group (i.e. high school lit. class).     The themes of this book, I feel, are actually more powerful than the writing, female domination, male empowerment, societal systems, etc. In fact, it's likely to provoke a discussion that's far superior to the experience of reading \\"...Cuckoos's Nest\\".

First of all I can't recommend this book to people who don't read or are not familiar with comic books, especially classic Superman books. It's not that you won't enjoy this book. It's just that it may not seem like much. To a new comic reader, Supreme reads like a cheesy, stupid, superhero book. To people who have reads tons of cheesy, stupid, superhero books, Supreme is pure gold. It's a semi-serious satire of the Superman mythos.     Writer Alan Moore, who single handily is reshaping the comic book genre, has great fun exposing all the flaws of a character like Superman. Moore's character, Supreme, can build a futuristic space fortress in no time, battle dozens of villains at once, but is a little slow when it comes to common sense. He can't even figure out why people don't recognize him as his alter ego when all he really does is put on glasses. By the end of this book Supreme is confrounted with the ultimate truth...that he is nothing more than a comic book hero, unfortunately he's too dense to get it.     The writing and art pay tribute to those comic creators that came before them; there are respectable nods to Captain Marvel, Legion of Superheroes, Jack Kirby, and Superman. It's not a spoof of comics; it's just Alan Moore pulling the curtain back far enough for us to see him winking in our general direction.    I highly recommend more of Mr. Moore's work including, \\"Watchman\\" and  \\"From Hell\\"	2005-01-04

That's what made \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" so powerful, its complete world captivates us while its complex story line fulfills us. Christopher Paolini seems to understand this in his first book \\"Eragon\\".<br /><br />Every year there's always a book released attached to a gimmick. In 2003 it was Eragon, a book written by a teenager. In fact when Paolini started Eragon he was 15. So it was an amazing surprise to learn what a fine and smart writer Paolini is becoming. Paolini tells the tale of Eragon, a caring, smart, but immature teenager who happens upon a dragon egg. The egg hatches and the baby dragon that immergences from within bonds with Eragon, creating not only an inseparable relationship but also a series of problems for the both of them. Like much fantasy, it is a story drawn in broad shades of black and white, but it's also a story of self-discovery. Eragon over times develops from boy to man and it is here that Paolini makes this more than good fantasy; he makes his mark as a surprisingly mature writer with a solid future.<br /><br />Eragon is the first book of a series, so the book ends a bit to abruptly. Still I'm very curious to see how this series and Paolini develop over the course of time.	2005-01-03

However, Tom Levinson, though his hearts in the right place, writes a book that's only half of what it should be.    When I first heard of this book I half expected it to be a sort of biblical \\"On the Road\\", a journey of faith or in search of faith. Instead we get Tom Levinson,  a Theology student who is basiclly tying up his academic loose ends. He travels across the country talking to Jews, Wicca's, Sikhs, etc. This is all fine but unfortunately Levinson has the prose of a graduate student. I didn't expect him to be Keroack, but I did expect something richer, something more fulfilling. Levinson respects all his interviews but there is little insight. He creates a business card which reads \\"Project Director of \\"God Is: An Oral History of Faith in America\\". Cute, but it comes across awkward and maybe even a little silly.    I read this book almost a year ago and sadly all I could originally remember were two passages, one in which the ever polite Levinson is surprised by the arrogance of an evangelical Christian minister. That was the best surprise of the book for me and frankly this book needed more of them.    For better books on road trips I'd recommend:  \\"On the Road\\" by Jack Kerouac  \\"A Walk Across America\\" by Peter Jenkins  or \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\" by Mike McIntyre    For books based on religious investigation I'd recommend:  \\"Salvation on Sand Mountain: Snake Handling and Redemption in Southern Appalachia\\" by Dennis Covington  \\"Under the Banner of Heaven : A Story of Violent Faith\\" by Jon Krakauer  \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" by Benjamin Hoff  or \\"Nine Parts of Desire : The Hidden World of Islamic Women\\" by Geraldine Brooks    For media based on religious experience, I'd recommend:  The movie \\"Saved\\", now on DVD  Or go to the website based on the radio show This American Life and listen to shows  \\"Leaving the Fold\\" and \\"My Experimental Phase\\"    Granted my recommendations tend to be, for the most part, darker, but established religions are all combinations of dark and light. Levinson gives us neither, just a friendly informative, almost text book like approach to the diversity of religion in America.    (2 and a half stars)	2004-12-30

It's not entirely an ego trip. McManus surprised everyone, including himself, by reaching the final table in the World Series of Poker, a tournament he entered as part of the research he was doing for this book.  <br /> <br />McManus goes back and forth between the suspected murder of Binion and his upward climb in the tournament. The passages about Binion's death are the most riveting. McManus thinks he has his murderer in Sandy Murphy, Ted's beautiful and easy to hate girlfriend. And this is the main problem with the book, as of 2004 Sandy (and her lover Rick Tabash) were acquitted of the murder. The book, written in 2003, gives us a vague sense that justice was done...the evil Sandy and Ted were found guilty and put in jail, but the case was more complicated than that and the author, distracted by his own story, ends up doing little to investigate what was really going on. <br /> <br />The poker side of the book also has it's faults, McManus is too close to the story to provide smart objective reporting. He does offer some excellent advice in how to not only play poker but to practice for tournament poker play. He also does an excellent job in conveying all the fears, joys, anxieties, highs and lows that go along in tournament play. <br /> <br />If you're a poker player or want to be, get the book and read the poker chapters. If you're a mystery lover, wait 'til a more complete book comes out on the Ted Binion case. If you're just looking for a good, consistent read...keep looking. <br />	2004-12-29

Sometimes that can help a book enormously, because it ropes in readers who wouldn't normally be drawn to such a book. Sometimes it's bad because it ropes in readers who wouldn't normally be drawn to such a book.    For those not normally drawn to such material beware. The first half of \\"Pi\\" is not the easiest read. The cover is misleading, in that this is not a cutesy animal story.  Also, people drawn to this book looking for quick answers are going to be disappointed.    \\"Life of Pi\\" starts off with a few beautiful nuggets about Pi, a boy whose father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, India. Pi's father tries to teach his family a lesson by forcing them to watch a ravenous tiger, named Richard Parker, devour a live goat. The children coil in fear as the father reminds them that the animals around them are not their pets. It is to be an important lesson. Later Pi is amazed and captivated by all the beliefs that surround him in India, even atheism. Though he has a problem with agnostics. This slow build up sets the stage for the second half of the book where, after selling the zoo, Pi and his family sail to the Americas to begin a new life. The ship soon sinks along with several of the zoo animals, which had been sold to other zoos in Canada and the U.S. Pi survives by climbing into a life boat filled with animals, including Richard Parker.    What follows next is not a Disney like story, where the boy and tiger become fast friends. This is a story about impossible survival. This second half of the book moves with lightning speed as we see Pi forced to adapt and change in order to live.    I think that many who were drawn to this book felt that it would have some great and immediately change on their beliefs. That perhaps it would heighten their spiritually. The book even sells itself as \\"proof of God\\", but this is not what the author says..it's what a character says to the author in reference tothis story. It's those subtle and wonderful and confusing moments that make this book so rich. Is Richad Parker a tiger, a metaphor, or something much worst. We never get the real answer. In fact we are almost forced to make a leap of faith ourselves as to what really happened to Pi in that lifeboat. In retrospect, I can't think of a better analogy of faith.    One final note, buy 10 copies of this book and create a reading club. In my opinion, you'll get more out of this book with a group.	2004-12-29

It doesn't get any less intimidating when you crack open the spine and realize that this is not just the story of London, but the story of several families and how they thrive, prosper, and fail over the course of 2000 years along the Thames. A family tree takes up a couple pages and to trace your finger along it makes the task of reading about all these characters seem daunting. However, once I began the first story, I was hooked.  <br /> <br />It is here that we are introduced to our first family, the Celtic Duckets (a trait ascribed to their webbed hands, also a neat literary trick to track the Ducket heirs). Soon we meet the Anglo-Saxon Barnikels and the Norman Silversleeves as well as a few other families. Each generation bringing new changes to London as well as to their perspective families. Together these families over the course of time  fight Caesar, build the Tower of London, create the British stock exchange, and save Shakespeare's career. They live on London Bridge and converse with Henry the VIII. Some even eventually seek their fortune in the Americas. Each chapter is a new time and a new tale.  Rutherfurd also has a talent for spinning witty, quick, and easy to digests historic yarns. <br /> <br />After so many pages and so many separate stories, I couldn't tell if I was running out of steam or maybe it was Rutherfurd. Either way I was grateful to close the cover on the book. It was great fun, but even fun has to end sometime.  <br />(4 and a half stars)	2004-12-29

If he did, then in all likelihood his addiction to drugs would have one day overcome him. Enter Sigmund Freud who has had some success in treating such conditions.  <br /> <br />In \\"Seven Percent Solution\\" by Nicholas Meyer, Dr. Watson tricks Holmes into visiting Freud, as Holmes' addiction has not only weakened his friend physically but seems to be effecting his mental condition as well. Meyer's does a splendid job in creating a convincible scenario where Holmes and Freud both confront and soon congratulate one another. Of course a mystery soon sprouts forth and Holmes and Freud team up to solve it.  <br /> <br />The real mystery, of course, is Holmes. Through Freud we get a better understand of Holmes and his obsession with mysteries, Hint: it has to do with his mother. The book makes this all work and it's an enjoyable read; however, it is not an easy fit with the rest of the Holmes books written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It's main fault is that it erases one of  Doyle's best characters by means of psychoanalysis. So if you're a Sherlock nut, this book may offend you in the end...but it's a good read nonetheless.	2004-12-28

This brings us to the question...how do you review something that appears to be a reflection but is in actually an original? If we strip away the TV show and movie, what we have left is a series of memories  about very young doctors trying to cope with the red tape and red blood that war always brings. The book reads like a series of old war stories with Richard Hooker as our M.C., harking back to his salad days as a M.A.S.H surgeon. The stories are loosely strung together giving the appearance of a plot, but the book is really nothing more than the often funny, sometimes sad, but mostly true tales of doctors on the front line in Korea.  <br /> <br />Compared to the movie, M.A.S.H., the book is almost identical in tone and content. All the characters are the same and the majority of stories in the book end up in the movie. The one big difference is that the movie took an anti-Vietnam tone. The book shies away from this, aside from showing that war isn't as stupid as the people running it.  <br /> <br />Compared to the TV show, the book comes off rather weak. What the book did well, the TV show excelled at.  <br /> <br />What the book does better than the TV show and movie did is that it explains better the arrogance and spontaneity of the doctors. Arrogance and spontaneity not brought on by confidence and experience, but rather by youth and inexperience. These were slightly older kids operating on slightly younger kids. And the result is one dark but funny memoir. <br />	2004-12-27

The rest of the story, about a boy, Jack, and his fairy noir adventures in the big city, in this case Toy City where a serial killer is on the lose, reads like a weak copy of Rodger Rabbit.

Our boy Jack, becomes an impromtu, dectective along with his partner Eddie the Teddy Bear, and tries to solve the case.    Robert Rankin is a popular British author and perhaps if I were British or more familiar with his style I would have enjoyed the book more.

In curious form, the narrator is the man's wife.      Over the course of the book, what starts off like a sure fire concept seems to get muddled and confused. Slowed down by Hornby's love of pop culture references, the book wades though social experiments like Adopt a Bum that arn't funny, end up being too predictable, and go nowhere. In the end, the family grows to appreciate each other but it was too little too late for me.	2004-12-23

In an attempt to capitalize on that book, \\"Bullfighter...\\" was released.  <br /> <br />The book takes some of Orlean's favorite and most popular articles and complies them into what appears to be a theme about remmarkable people. Orlean speaks candidly in the begining of her book about always wanting to be a writer and ironicly this introduction proves to be some of the best writing in the book. The rest of the books tends to be pretty much hit and miss. A fasinating story about a taxi driver who is in reality an African king somehow ends up being not so fasinating. Another story about a 10 year old is down right boring. My favorite ended up being about a store owner in New York that only sells buttons. <br /> <br />This is not to say that Orlean is a bad writer, she's not: however she writes with a sometimes akward detachment that made it hard for me to enjoy these \\"personal\\" articles.	2004-12-22

I eventually found a copy at a used book store and set down to read the thing. My first surprise is that it's not a novel, it's a lesson in enviromental philosophy set up as a dialogue between a talking ape, named Ishmeal, and a man.     At first I enjoyed the book, I thought there were some \\"out there\\" but interesting ideas. The logic of the book built up nicely and I found myself a bit caught up with it's pro enviromental statement. In the end however, the book is not able to back that enviromental statement up.     In a nut shell, Ishmeal wants us to abandon our agricultural state and return to that of a hunting and gathering society. If we don't do this we are doomed says Ishmeal, but the book does not explan how we should do this. It does hint that those too weak and old will die off, enriching the rest of our lives as a natural result. I found the message extreme, and with no \\"real\\" soulutions. The book just becomes another cult exercise appealing to people in search of an answer...even if those answers are skewed.	2004-12-22

In fact the way he writes makes me think that the two of us would have a grand time together, maybe over dinner as we discussed and laughed over world affairs. That's the kind of writer Friedman is, he makes you feel at ease as he discusses major global changing events with a seemlying simplistic common sense style. <br /> <br />If you aren't familiar with Friedman's colums in the New York Times, but want to understand better a post 9-11 world...this book is you opportunity. \\"Longitudes\\" is a collection of his colums, most of which focus on mid-east realtionships. Friedman doesn't hold back. When it comes to the central problem of Islamic extremist, the Arabs offen ignore the problem while the U.S. offen exploits it...or did until 9-11. Today, everyone seems to not fully understand the new world they now live in. <br /> <br />The down side of Friedman is that he can be a little repeative and preachy. His solutions are sound but sometimes don't take everything into consideration. Also if you've been reading his work, this book may offer nothing new to you. Still, to sit down and read or re-read this collection of his work from Dec 15th 2000 to July 3rd 2002 is to expose yourself (in a relatively short period of time) to the begining...when the world was torn in two. Friedman still thinks it can be fixed and maybe that's what I like about him the most.	2004-12-21
US	32095190	R1KTVIAA5TJA6C	0380978938	591476242	Ilium	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Ultimately Rewarding	When I am about to read a Dan Simmons book I prepare myself. I prepare myself because, it's not always going to be an easy read and everything may not have the closer I want it to have. I believe this is because Simmons does not write for the lowest common denominator(ala The Da Vinci Code-not that \\"Code\\" doesn't have it's own merits).You have to fill in some of the blanks yourself, you have to look at some of his phrases and  treat them as if they were mini-puzzles. In fact I would only recommend a Dan Simmons book to someone whose reading habits and tastes I were familiar with...and even then it can be a poor recommendation. So with that said we look at Ilium, part one of a two part book series.    Those familiar with Dan Simmons' \\"Hyperion\\" should not be disappointed. Again we are flung far into the future where a robot society exists among the moons on the edge of our solar system, earth is an old forgotten planet with Logan's Run overtones, and Mars has become the new Mount Olympus where the Greek gods of old live and breath again.     The main plot centers around the gods as they recreate the Trojan War on the plains of Mars. The people fighting for (and sometimes with) the gods think they are on the Mediterranean, they think they are Paris, Helen, Achilles etc.. The gods also re-animate academics of old to monitor the war and make sure it follows Homer's book. One of these academics, Hockenberry, is propositioned by Aphrodite to kill Athene. Hockenberry is dammed if he does and dammed if he doesn't. His ultimate response turns the Iliad upside down.     The other two sub plots intertwine with the main story, one more than the other, but all the stories are filled imagination and mind pondering moments. Being the first of two books, there are many questions left unresolved. The book does has more finality  than \\"Hyperion\\" however.    Ilium should appeal to all fans of Simmons, a good many sci-fi fans and maybe even a few followers of Homer.	2004-12-20

This is not a book that looks at the mysteries of the ocean like giant squids, tidal waves, perfect storms, etc. This is a book about how big, usally unnamed and European,  capitalist squeeze out every dime of profit they can from the tanker trade.  <br /> <br />Once his theme is established the books then braches off into three main problems of sea trafficking, the surprisly high number of still sinking vessels, modern pirates, and the enviromental problems associated with dismantling ships. <br /> <br />It's a fasinating report, all be it a tad dry at times, condensed into a brief 239 pages.	2004-12-20

Silver orbs mysteriously appear around the globe at different periods in time. The orbs are then collectively combined, bringing with them their own respective periods. The result is a new earth made like a patch work quilt of time.     In book one a 21st century UN helicopter crash lands yards away from a 19th century British fort in Afghanistan, A Russian space craft is forced to land and confront Genghis Khan, and Alexander the Great marches towards Baghdad, picking up  refugees from time along the way. The three stories eventually combine in a fairly satisfying way but we never discover much more about those silver orbs (I assume we will in the following books). Also the very end left me more confused than satisfied.     I've read Clarke before and I've enjoyed his work, it's smart and reads smooth. Time Eye is definitely smart. I loved that the characters weren't motivated by their own stupidity. Everyone does a realistic job of accepting if not totally understanding the situation. However the book seemed a bit choppy and at times awkward to me. In this first book alone we come across, Genghis Khan, Alexander Great, and Rudyard Kipling. I realize that this is what makes time travel stories so much fun, taking real places and people from the past and saying \\"What if?\\", but it also seems a bit stale and easy for a writer of Clarke's ability.     The big question is...  Will I buy the next book?...Probably, the series still has steam and a lot of potential. Will I be as hopeful of the next book?...Not so much.	2004-12-17

However, if your just a movie buff who has perhaps seen or heard of Bruce one or two times... this book may not be the best book on Hollywood you read. Still, after reading \\"Chins\\" I came away amazed at two things. First, that this is a great primer on the joy and ruimentary art of film making/producing and second, that Bruce Campbell has been in a hell of a lot of stuff. In fact,it's quite possible to play a more advanced version of Six Degees of Kevin Bacon, substituting Bruce for Kevin. Here, let's go from James Stewart to Bruce Campbell. <br /> <br />James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story with <br />Katharine Hepburn in Guess who's Coming to Dinner with <br />Spencer Tracy in Mad Mad Mad Mad World with <br />Carl Reiner in Ocean's 11 with  <br />George Clooney in Intolerable Cruelty  with <br />Bruce Cambell  <br /> <br />See what I mean...it's fun and so is the book.	2004-12-16

It will not spur on a generation to greatness nor will ride high atop the bestsellers list with a movie deal in the works. No, this is the type of book that simply flows over you, like a warm bath on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Sadly, it's probably doomed to sit on the dusty shelves of Hay on Wye, a small Welsh town that has come to base it's economy on the sale of used and mostly forgotten books. American Paul Collins works in one of the around 40 book shops there and flirts with the idea of settling his young family in this hamlet he has come to love.  <br /> <br />If you are a bibliophile or an Anglophile, it's a definate must read. If you are neither of the above...sadly, you probably won't find the book as charming. Collins tends to get a little long winded on some of the forgotten books he shares with us. Also he never delves deeper into the man responsible for this bookish town, a crazy like a fox eccentric named Richard Booth. We do get to know Booth as well as the town of Hay but in the end it's all to brief and little is explored beyond the initial surface.	2004-12-15

It's obvious because he says it in his book, but also because the description of how he became thief and how he pulled off some of his biggest heists is riveting. There is a certain smart ass joy to his retelling of stealing Phyllis Diller's jewlery not once but twice. However, Mason had no joy in dealing with the police. Fighting the law is never fun, and that's what takes up a good part of the second half of the book. Mason twists his way past the cops eventually (doing very little jail time in the end) but his deaings with the police seem to hinder both him and the book. <br />Mason also skims over the sex and drug use that seemed to steadily became a part of his life during the 1970's and 1980's, but that may have been a wise move. I was curious to look deeper into how Mason was living and why he was doing what he was doing, but, perhaps thet's better left to another author. <br />	2004-12-13

Most of the problem rests with the author who tries to cram too many characters and too much information in to, what appears to be, a book for teens. Being 38 and a avid reader, I had a rather hard time getting though it. So I just can't see many teens having the patience to read  Shadowmancer to the end. Many reviewers have recommended C.S.Lewis and the Harry Potter books as alternatives. These are wise reviewers and I happily support them. I'd also like to add pretty much any thing written by Neil Gainman (who often writes of similar themes)and Eragon  by Christopher Paolini. Paolini is a teen who writes like a pro. Taylor would be smart to read his work before Shadowmancer 2: Demurral's Wraith.	2004-09-07

The chapters are short, the story is silly fun, and it's quite easy to get into character (if you want to add that element of different voices to your story). All in all we're both happily hooked on Akiko!	2003-10-06

The first half of the book is a riot as a result of this. The second half of the book falls back into the standared format of the VFD mystery. The ending, however, has a few twists and a nice cliffhanger of an ending. Overall, a joyfull read.	2003-02-05
