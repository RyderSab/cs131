There are techniques for rope cording, fabric cording, tassels in pillows with corded trim, box pillows, yarn fringe, etc.  I only gave it 4 stars because I wish there were more pictures with descriptions, as being a relative novice, I needed more explanation.  However, you can get the hang of it  pretty well with the pictures that are supplied.  This is a great reference book for your sewing library.	2005-01-24
US	50770577	R16YVAD34XM7GC	0312288492	523006383	Best Enemies (Heller, Jane)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Definitely up to Jane Heller's usual standards!	Jane Heller is one of my favorite authors.  She never disappoints, and this wonderful novel is proof.  Amy and Tara were best friends for years until one act of betrayal rips them apart, and then makes them both pretend to be people that they aren't, and have things they don't really have in order to impress each other.  Anyone who has a best friend will see a little bit of themselves here, as Jane Heller explores the underlying competetiveness in all relationships with her usual humor and skill.  Highly recommended.	2004-04-27

If there is only one book you read all year, it should be this one.  Victor Carl starts out on a seedy mission of revenge, but slowly comes to believe his hapless client is innocent.  How he goes about proving it is amazing, and I don't want to give anything away, but you won't be sorry you read this book.	2003-12-09

It was worth it just to see the mistress get her just desserts.  The children, Marsha and Teddy, are two whiny brats with no appeal whatsoever.  There are better books out there about revenge - read Olivia Goldsmith or Jane Heller	2003-11-07

Ms. Wolitzer's observations about married life are remarkably on target.  Her writing style is truly amazing, just beautiful.  There is a lot to talk about in reading groups with this book.

Written in the same vain as Jane Heller, this novel portrays a middle-aged single mom, stuck in what we call the &quot;sandwich generation.&quot;  Alternately worried about her kids and her elderly mom, while trying to juggle a career as a newly-graduated corporate attorney, this novel is realistic in showing her struggles, but always with a keen sense of humor.

I was getting more angry at Nanny than Mrs. X.  However, I'm sure that most of this rings true because I actually do know someone who was raised like this (and fortunately now is raising her own child totally differently,  and doing a very good job!) but her own mother won't ever babysit or change a diaper for the grandchild.  I guess all you can say is that all that glitters is not gold.  Thank goodness for your average parents - maybe they're a little dysfunctional, but at least they care!	2002-04-18

Marcy Lee Mallowitz is a literal nobody &quot;Personal Life Coach&quot; and former closet organizer who gets thrust into the media spotlight for being dumped on national TV.  However, since she has such a high Q ratio (likeability factor), the whole world is sending her presents in order to get an interview with her.  She is the hottest thing since Darva  Conger.  You will laugh hysterically and relate to the crazy shennanigans because similar things happen in the newspaper every day.

I also wasn't totally satisfied with the conclusion once I got there. Before I pick up the next mystery in this series, I will have to make sure it's under 300 pages.

I have read many of the previous reviews;  however, I really did like this novel.  I found it enjoyable, and totally engrossing.  There were two threads to follow in this story.  One was explained (although it was not spelled out ad nauseum, you could certainly figure it out!) and the story with the brothers was left kind of open, but I don't mind mulling that one over every once in a while when I think about it.  I do agree that the one brother leaving the gun around would not be a typical action for a true sociopath who has covered up so cleverly up to now.  Some things seemed like Kinsey should know better, but then again, all mysteries seem to suffer from the same thing.<br />But basically, this was a well-written page-turner.  I would recommend it.	2002-01-07
