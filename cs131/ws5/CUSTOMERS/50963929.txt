US	50963929	R2S0IV1SXDQ0FZ	1560250712	664143690	The Fire This Time: U.S. War Crimes in the Gulf	Books	1	18	68	N	N	One of the worst books about the Gulf War	In this work, Mr. Clark seems intent on placing the blame for the war on the United States-led Coalition. I understand that the title of the book includes the words &quot;U.S. War Crimes,&quot; but even so a mention of  the context in which the war was fought (illegal siezing of hostages by  Iraq, the brutal occupation of Kuwait) might be useful. Instead, the reader  gets the impression that Saddam Hussein, evil dictator extraordinaire, was  just minding his own business when the Air War was launched. The so-called  &quot;war crimes&quot; outlined by Clark seem to consist of three main  points: 1) inflicting Iraqi casualties all out of proportion to our own (to  me, a GOOD thing), 2) our failure to foresee that poor ol' Hussein would  have to resort to environmental terrorism, dumping oil in the Gulf and  torching Kuwait's oil wells, and 3) not allowing the Iraqi Army to withdraw  from Kuwait intact. Withdraw? It was a retreat, then a rout made in the  face of a Coalition land assault. This book is an excellent example of a  premise (U.S. is EVIL) driving the facts, which ones are used and how they  are interpreted. Clark should get an Iraqi medal from Saddam's Ministry of  Propaganda for this one.	1999-10-21

Despite the title, it's not all about Al Franken (a character I was previously cognizant of only as &quot;that jerk&quot;)but lampoons Liberals in general. A great read! If having laugh at the expense  of Liberals is &quot;hateful,&quot; then this book has enough good ol' hate  for everyone in the family!	1999-10-21

However, too many seemed to be based on Vietnam-War stereotypes (the one about &quot;don't shoot the general's helicopter&quot; comes to mind). And the  implication that all Kuwaitis who got out of their country just sat around  all day sipping drinks was not just wrong, it was unjust. Two brigades of  Kuwaitis aided in the liberation of their country when the time came. But  parts of the book are all right, despite the artist being totally out of  touch with today's military.	1999-10-21

If they did that, 1984 would be my pick. I've read it at least four times, once when I had insomnia I read the whole thing  front to back again. The first time I read it was in high school, and I was  disappointed because it didn't have a happy ending, because Smith didn't  manage to somehow smash Big Brother. But now I recognize the book for what  it is: a timeless statement on totalitarianism and individualism. Don't let  the title fool you: if we're not very, very careful it can happen yet.	1999-10-19

I thought USSA would be a better book, and indeed the beginning of it displayed much promise. However, past the Revolution itself it slipped downhill. You never get a good feel for the events that surreound the  individuals. Also, the mixing of real-life and fictional characters just  didn't work for me.

This is a fascinating look at the life of a true genius whose path took him, inevitably, to Saddam's door. His dream of producing a gun capable of putting a satellite into orbit was twisted into a weapon for the Iraqi  regime. Reads like an espionage novel, although it slows down a bit when  talking about the businesses and fronts used to get the weapon's parts into  Iraq. Otherwise, a really good read!	1999-10-17

History that almost reads like a novel	Stunning facts about the Cold War comes out in this book, along with a few unresolved matters, such as the spies in West Germany. The part I liked best was the Libyan connection in East Germany. I was there when the Berlin  disco bombing incident took place, and I couldn't understand why our  bombers were sent to Tripoli in response by Reagan. It just goes to show  that back in those days the President launched military operations with a  purpose.	1999-10-16

I think the book was well-written, but it still leaves me skeptical. I had heard of a supposed &quot;psychic warfare&quot; operation involving the Army during the 1980s, but always put it down as an unfounded rumor. Still,  some of the events Morehouse describes don't quite ring true for some  reason. Still, you don't have to believe to enjoy it.	1999-10-16

A young lieutenant assigned to an antiaircraft unit in England in the 1950s finds out that the guns don't work, that is, they are incapable of shooting down Soviet aircraft. He is  in a dilemma made clear by his battalion commander: is it more important  that the guns work, or that the Soviets THINK they work? One of my favorite  books of all time.	1999-10-16

Sky Pirates is no exception, but it falls short of most of the books (it fares head and shoulders above Interior  World, however). I did like the idea of putting Indy in a team setting, and  the pace of the book was very good. But the description on the back cover  sounded like it described an entirely different book (none of the action  took place in Tibet and there was no discussion of telekinetic power) and  there were factual flaws (like Indy talking about Truth or Consequences New  Mexico when at that time the name of the town was Radium Springs). The  secret organization attempting to dominate the world is barely given a  two-dimensional description and a high-level secret meeting in an American  underground facility is improbable to say the least, given the context of  the 1930s and international political turmoil. Where did all this  speculation about ancient disks and ancient flyers come from? It certainly  didn't go anywhere. And lastly, the climax leaves too many loose ends: only  the secret weapon of the secret organiation is gone. What of the  organization itself? Will the rest of the crew deal with them in a later  episode? I don't want to make it sound like this is a bad book; really I'm  just nit-picking. The author has captured the excitement and suspense of  the other books and I am glad that I read it. I'm just disappointed that it  wasn't a little better.	1999-10-15

We now know that Americans participated in Stalin-inspired Trotskyite hunts within the ranks of the  International Brigades. While Merriman almost certainly met his end at a  Nationalist firing squad, how many American Reds met their end at  Merriman's orders?    The writing style of the book was in the nature of a  justification of a cause that was morally bankrupt, even in the context of  fighting fascism. I recommend the book to anyone who wishes to better  understand the mindset of liberal thinking . . .	1999-10-15

To enjoy this book one has far beyond willing suspension of disbelief. The plot would have made a so-so science-fiction novel, but as an Indiana Jones book it falls short of the mark.

This book should result in the rewriting of some aspects of our history. The idea that American Communists were just trying to create Socialism in America with &quot;guidance&quot; from their fraternal brothers and sisters  in Russia is a blatent lie: as the authors show, the CPUSA was a puppet for  the Soviets, doing their bidding.

This book puts in perspective the current threat posed by hostile nuclear missiles: That the threat has INCREASED rather than decreased, that the United States has more to lose now than ever from a nuclear attack, and  that the prospects for a viable defense are better than ever before.      Dr. Anderson also spells out in no uncertain terms the greatest obstacle to  a National Missile Defense: President Bill Clinton. The President's foreign  policy is not content with providing however many millions of dollars in  aid for a nation which openely supports the anti-American Iraqi and Serbian  regimes, but he also wishes to appease a Russia which posesses and  increasingly unstable nuclear arsenal in the interests of following our  &quot;obligations&quot; to an ABM treaty signed in the seventies and  abrogated by the USSR within a few years of its adoption. Instead, he  wishes to rely on our nuclear deterrent. President Clinton, apparently,  does not agree that it is morally wrong to offer defense over vengeance for  the American people.    I disagree with some technical details of Dr.  Anderson's proposed missile defense (a ground-based weapon system would be  essential to its success) but other than that I would not hesitate to  recommend this book.	1999-10-15

In Endgame, Mr. Ritter does what President Clinton can not, or will not, do: address America's continueing role in Iraq's war of attrition with the Coalition. Even critics of this book must admit that it at least offers a  better solution for the never-ending confrontation in the Middle East,  which by the way keeps thousands of men and women in the service away from  home for months at a time, or deprives many of them from their homes and  their families for no-notice deployments during holidays.
