HAMPTON CAN PULL OFF ANYTHING	I only read this book because Ms. Hampton wrote it and so far all of her books have been off the chain. I enjoyed this book, but not as much as the others. I didn't like the way that the book ended. Alot of times I found myself mad because I thought of myself and I would KILL my best friend if she messed with my man rather I dogged him or not. I just can't totally get into books like \\"My Daughter's Boyfriend\\" and now \\"My Best Friend's Husband\\". It is something about crossing that line that sickens me. I thought that Johnathan's feelings were to deep for Sylvia. To me love should always prevail and somehow Johnathan should have been focused on his vows and the love he and his wife shared after he realized he was wrong. The drama I could stand because I guess it does happen and Ms. Hampton made it juicy, but I wish the ending was different.  Like I said, Ms. Hampton can pull off anything.	2004-11-01

Now I know that it is available in some bookstores and will shortly be available on amazon.com.  I discovered Ms. Hampton on amazon.com and have been reading her books back to back. I am starting My Best Friends Man today. You have to be a fabulous author for a reader to read all your books back to back and want more. I am a Jalin fan. I can't get enough of all his drama with his women. I would say that Two's Enough, Three is a Crowd and this book are equally fun to read. But I absolutely loved Two's Enough and Three is a Crowd because it was a introduction into \\"Jalin's world\\". I was laughing so hard and speechless learning Jalin's ways. While reading the sequel, I felt like Jalin was my brother and I was just catching up on his drama-filled love life. I am so attached to Jalin's character. Ms. Hampton is so down to earth. I emailed her to tell her how fabulous her books are and she emailed me back the same day. How could you not love an author like that? Keep them coming Ms. Hampton!	2004-10-28

There are lots of hot sex scenes, which I enjoyed, but I don't think the writer delivered the story in a way that kept me excited or longing to know what happened next. The writer seemed to jump subjects quick, seeming like she was trying to squeeze some thoughts into this very short novel. It just depends on what type of author's work you are use to reading. I just discovered Brenda Hampton and am reading all her books back to back. So sometimes that can throw a reader off when a new author's skill level doesn't equate to what you are use to. Don't get me wrong, the book is worth reading, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off.  If you want to read a book of short stories that are all the bomb, read \\"Around the Way Girls\\". It is off the hook!	2004-10-21

Books	5	7	8	N	N	THIS BOOK IS TIGHT	Brenda Hampton is truly talented as she is able to go from a lover boy type novel (Two's Enough, Three is a Crowd), to this street filled novel. I really enjoyed both novels. Kiley is left an empire to uphold after his father was killed. While running from a secret of his past life, the reader goes into a life of streets, women, drugs, relationship drama, shiesty friends, true friends, and more. This was a well written novel. It makes the book so much better when you don't have any idea how the novel will unfold (to many readers give stuff away). As I said about Ms. Hampton's other review, people are not reviewing this book this well for nothing! Good job Ms. Hampton. I am starting her next book My Way or No Way tommorrow.

You could hardly tell that they were short stories besides the fact that you wanted more. None of the authors slacked on anything. I felt like I knew the characters in all of the stories. \\"Around the Way Girls\\" is really about issues that some women have in the hood. One girl has a hard life and has to resort to stripping but wants a better life. It also has issues of trusting your friends, and getting out of bad relationships. It is just hood written. One girl wants to go to college and get out of her disfunctional house and is also dealing with her brother's death. But there are more twists and turns to this story that you will enjoy. That last story is about a girl that chose to date a drug dealer against her better judgement. This story takes you into the club scene. It tells you how he met her, and all the crap she goes through dealing with a thug. This is the best book of short stories that I have read. Each author did a wonderful job.	2004-10-08

B-More Careful is to good of a book not to recommend it. It is very gritty and grimmy. To many authors try to write ghetto fiction and it comes off like most of the other books, seeming repetitive and unbelievable. B-More Careful has so many twists and turns.

Now, not to glorify violence, but if you are looking to read a good street novel, Dutch should do it.

First of all, I didn't know that this book was more than just a story about a mother prostituting her child. I was hesitant about picking up this book and, I looked at the ratings and didn't read the actual reviews of this book. So many people give to many details when reviewing the book and it ruins the surprises. I didn't know anything, so the book was just mind blowing! Obviously the book is about Queen Esther taking advantage of her daughter's innocence and prostituting her starting off as a teenager. Queen Esther is the worst kind, who is a lover of money and will get it at ANY cost. She plays on teenagers who has problems and makes them think she is a safe haven when she is a snake, actually destroying their lives. It's surprising what some people will do for a dollar, or should I say feel like they have to do. And Gloria also touches  on the mental affect of females selling their bodies. All and all Arnell desperately wants to move on with her life, but Esther has a hold on her. A hold combined with past secrets that she holds over her head, and the confusing feeling of loving her mother in spite of. Queen Esther is a mess! You can't even imagine the things that will unfold in this book. Sometimes I thought Queen Esther was the devil himself. Gloria Mallette did a wonderful job of writing this novel. It is serious, entertaining, and surprisely funny. Queen Esther is such a bitch, but some things will have you laughing like I can't beleive she did or said that. Scenes like the funeral, particular sex scenes, and the confrontation at the end of the book will leave your mouth wide open!! Gloria intertwines love, family ties, sex, life lessons, prostitution, humor, murder....you name it, it is in this book. I read Shades of Jade and it is good. But The Honey Well is on another level. Ms. Mallette definetely is da bomb. I will be recommending this book to everyone I know who enjoys reading good black fiction novels. The books description doesn't give you a clue as to what all is in store for you.	2004-09-22

I give it a four because of the principal and the moral to the story. The delivery just wasn't exciting. It's more of a story telling how you feel after someone cheats and the biblical fight to honor your vows. Being that I am engaged, I would hope that I could apply the same biblical principles to my marriage if that was to happen to me. Jasmine, which is Kyla's best friend, is lonely. She has lost her husband, has affairs with married men, has very few friends,and figures she can find happiness if she has Kyla's husband. Jasmine brings the greatest hurt ever to Kyla. Kylas has to decide if she can honor her marriage, or let go because of her husband's mistake. Jasmine also finds out that married men only use you for what you are worth, but really love their wives (hint to all you homewreckers). In the end, you are left lonely. It is a good book. It just lacked spice and excitement.	2004-09-09

When trouble came in their relationship (which you will have to read for yourself) she started talking to Craig and got pregnant by him. She is in love with one man and pregnant by the other. Kayla keeps it real because she could have lied but she didn't. She just goes for the ride of all the drama to come. Kayla finds out that she doesn't know Craig like she thought she did, her and Geno are broke up and everything seems to be going wrong. Kayla finds out who is true blue and who isn't. The book is just good. It is filled with lots of events you won't see coming. It is also funny. I can't wait to read LaJill's next book.	2004-08-10

I didn't think they were degrading or slutty, they were entertaining like reading Zane's novels. The  book was actually looking at the different women's relationship issues. Each women had a different issue. It went through their individual story and at the end told what they learned throughout their experiences. I laughed out loud on many parts. It was just a very enjoyable read for me, and I have never heard of this book. I just stumbled up on it, and I am glad I did.	2004-07-26

Jermaine's father Calvin was never in his life besides sending money. So Jermaine was left for the streets to raise him. Everyone has to deal with the decisions they make in life. Mr. Hunter displays that alot. People having to deal with their life's decisions in the end rather good or bad. But this is a powerful story the tells stories on so many levels other than what I have written here. Read it, you won't be disappointed.	2004-06-29

I didn't read it page by page. I thumbed through the book and got the basis of the book which is simple. I do believe that many times people are thinking they are being loving but not actually giving what their partner needs. I personally believe that every couple needs all of the 5 love languages in their relationship, but some may be more important than others. It was a reminder to me to try to make a choice to give the type of love I know my partner desires. I believe that if your mate is happy and their love tank is full, they will be less likely to stray in the relationship. It is a pretty good book. It is not the bible, where every word can be held to truth, but it is good and practical. I just checked out The Five Languages of Children today. I think we should all take time to read books that will strenghthen our minds to make us better mates and better parents.	2004-06-18

This book tackles several issues. Its basically about three generations of Shepard women. What hit me the hardest was Marley's issue. She was initially suppose to marry a guy that SHE chose and who everyone else thought was a good choice for her. Marley knew on the inside she was not truly happy but she didn't want to be lonely as her mother and grandmother had been. Then she realizes that she can only truly be happy when she allows her steps to be ordered by the Lord. It brings the scriptures true. If we first seek the kingdom of God everything else will be added onto us. We as women settle for less and are so impatient. We want everythng now, and we want to tell God how we want things to be done. We don't want to let God develop us and wait on God given blessings. This book also deals with her mother Pam's problem, and it shows how we all have to learn to put God first. This book shows a bond and strength in their bloodline, even though they have their fights. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bible preaching book. It is a great story. It's just that the story convicted me of my own life and I am drawn to focus on God. It is entertaining, funny, and some. Mrs. Ellis has a wonderful way with words and a great ability to paint pictures with her words. BRAVO! I was blessed by this book, and normally I read authors like Zane and Carl Weber. I said that to say that if you are use to reading drama and sex filled novels, you can still enjoy this book. Please read it and share it with other women. Mrs. Ellis needs more publicity.	2004-06-10

But I don't understand how this book got so many 5 star ratings. I read the book because of the hype and the ratings. So that disappointed me. I actually started the book and after awhile through it to the side. I always try to finish a book because sometimes they get better and this book did. Five stars is the best a book can be. I only give 5 stars when the book is off the chain from the first word to the last one. I did enjoy the book, but like some of the other readers, it took awhile for me to get into the book. I wanted to do like one of the other readers and skip through some parts to get to the real plot of the story. It just took so long for the story to unfold. The story line is slow and I feel that some parts could have been left out and some others more developed. I have never read a book with this type of storyline so Shonda gets a A for originality, but not for deliverance. Parts of the book is unrealistic to me. I couldn't see anyone waiting like she did for 5 whole years. Then Shonda didn't introduce Jarrin back into the story correctly. It was kind of elementary and silly. After he gave his excuse Yani's response was elementary. Jarrin didn't act as if they had been together for years. He acted like Yani was someone he casually dated. It was to unrealistic. Now Alex, he was a keeper! Alex was any woman's dream. To me it wouldn't be any competiton. The way Shonda created Jarrin's personality didn't make the story believable. Shonda could have drawn that drama out some! In my opinion, where the drama started is where the book ended. It was good for the first book. I do recommend the book, but don't expect to be blown off your feet.	2004-06-02

It was not as original as B-More Careful. And yes it did remind me of Player's Club, but it had its own differences.  If you haven't read B-More Careful, please do. It is off the chain!! I was torn between giving the book 3 stars or 4 stars. The book is fast paced with alot of twists and turns. I never got bored with the book and that is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  The book is basically about girls that try to make lemonade with the lemons of life. And they do it by stripping. Two girls in particular get up under this girl named Kat, who is [really bad]. I wanted to kick [Kat] myself! Tender and Goldie are basically settling for stripping because they feel like they don't have a choice. The only thing that got me is that some of the things were to stupid and Shannon made Tender and Goldie to gullible. How are they able to buy Gucci glasses, burberry fits, stilettos, for just one outfit and be worried about where to lay thier head? They could afford their own crib. Nobody is that gullible. Then Goldie was to gullible for me at the end of the book. I can't give it away. Read it for yourself.	2004-04-30

This book was entertaining and a good easy read. Its hard to tell about the book without giving to much away. I hate when people give away the book in their reviews!

I will say that the book was a good effort, but not off the hook. The negative side is, as many others said, the characters were not developed so you could not follow them and become emotionally involved in the book. There were to many characters just thrown on the scene, so I found myself having to re-read sentences trying to follow the story. Qua and Gena's relationship was the most developed relationship which I was semi-involved in, but their relationship wasn't developed either. He took her out of town, they had a nice time, he took her shopping, and boom.... there is the foundation of their relationship. Now she is so in love she can't see straight and he is her soulmate.There was no background as to where their love came from or them growing together through any situations. It was just that he bought her plenty of things. There were plenty of times I just wanted to stop reading the book, but I had to know what the hype was all about. The book was exagerated to me. I know some drug dealers make it to be millionaires, but not many. She should have been more realistic, or rather identified with more of the drug dealers that were ballers, but not have millions at their disposal. What millionaire do you know that takes his coke to some lil' lady that can't even pay her rent? And supposively he was moving plenty of kilos! Millionaires are to smart for stuff like that. They are not on front street with just any ole person. Teri had alot of unnecessary murder. It was just not a good plot and no plot for that matter. Now that I think about it, I should have given her 2 stars. The 3 stars is for effort. I didn't hate the book. Its just that it was unrealistic, had no plot or moral to the story, it was just a bunch of killing and slanging dope. The end was STUPID! I can't believe that she did that to Qua! He was the best thing about the story. It should have ended different. If you want to read a real street story...PLEASE READ THE COLDEST WINTER EVER!!!!! Now that book gets 10 stars.	2004-01-27

Nikki Turner did an o.k. job to me. Now if you compare it to The Coldest Winter Ever, it is garbage. But just to read, it will do. I gave the book a 3 which is an average rating. But The Coldest Winter Ever deserves 10 stars! You can tell Nikki is familiar with the streets. Some of the events were funny and real. I was getting ready to say that her being fifteen and all she went through is unrealistic, but it isn't. Plenty of girls fall in love with men that sell drugs and go for the ride of whatever the dope game brings. That is what this book is about. A girl who falls in love with an older drug dealer and what happens in her life when he is locked up. The book is worth reading, but it has a long way to go to reach the level of Sister Souljah's book.	2004-01-06

This is the first book I read of Sistah Souljah's and I agree that she should be given as much credit as other famous authors. When people ask me of a good book, I always say The Coldest Winter Ever. I thought people were exagerating when they said the book was all that. This book takes you into the life of a drug dealer's daughter who only knew the streets and how to hustle and she goes through MANY obstacles in this book. It shows the effects of being a drug dealers child, the glamorous side and the not so glamarous side. The book was so real!! It was a real page turner!! Winter was a product of her environnment. She lived a fabulous life, had the best of everything, was respected in her hood and then bam.... everything changes. This story is how Winter tries to make lemonade with lemons. The plot is unbelievable! I read this book in a little over 2 days. Please read this book. Sistah Souljah did an excellent job!!!!	2003-11-03

Why did I wait so long? This book more than exceeded my expectations. Winter is a character! Winter is from a well respected family with money. Well her father was big time. Her father always schooled Winter about the streets and the hustling game. He took more than good care of her. Winter had so much personality. Winter had to be stylish at all times. She was a spoiled hustler's child. Everything was peaches and cream until the game starts to fall apart. This book tells the story of Winter's struggle and determination to make it in the game. Winter has to stand on her own two feet and pull through the many obstacles that confront her. The Coldest Winter Ever is unpredictable. This book has comedy, sex, personal revelations, the list goes on and on. This is especially a good read for people that are from the streets or are affiliated with people that hustle. Even if you aren't, this is a great read. I can not express how good this book is. I finished it in 2 days. I still think about Winter like I am waiting to hear how Winter is doing.  I think there should be a sequel and also a movie. There are ALL sorts of twists and turns. The ending will knock your socks off. Bravo, Sistah Souljah!!!!	2003-08-05

All I can say is that everything around me was a distraction. (Working, eating, sleeping) I had dreams about this book and the characters. The plot unfolds into things you would not dream of. &quot;Freckles&quot; gets hit with a dose of reality, finding out her perfect husband and sucessful career  is not so perfect. It starts when she finds out he is cheating and it takes you on a roller coaster ride from there. The beginning is slower, much slower, than the rest of the book. Do not stop reading whatever you do. EJD has much respect from me. I am starting to read The Coldest Winter Ever and I keep thinking about The Other Woman. The Other Woman is one of the best books I have read.	2003-07-30

Reading Invisible Life really helped alot when reading this book because it provides some back ground. I felt like I knew the characters in this book. Kyle is my favorite in this book. He is so funny and spunky. Kyle's story will touch your heart.  This book grabbed me more emotionally than Invisible Life. Nicole's experience with love is beautiful. Ray is still battling with himself. Just As I Am is a book of friendship, love, and self acceptance. Read it.	2003-07-09

It sounded like something I would definitely enjoy. I am disappointed. This book is suppose to be three love stories. The stories are boring and repetitive. Tamara and Chris, which is the first story, was so boring I was hoping the story would finally end so that I can get to another. Tamara and Chris dealt with one situation and it just kept talking about the same ole problem and repeating how they felt about each other. There was no real drama, as far as relationship goes. I was looking to be entertained with the drama and possibly making up of the couples. It was boring. Now Shameika and Joop do have some hot sex scenes in the book. Their story is better than Tamara's and Chris' story. It would be good to me if a story was told, with different situations, ups and downs, something besides what they think about one particular issue. This story followed the same pattern. (repetitive) Zane or Michael Baisden, please write another book, I am dying out here!!!	2003-06-12

This book had Zane's sexual writing style with a mix of family ties and relationships. There are countless laughs in the book. The Whitfield sisters were how a real family should be.  Zane will take you inside each sister's life of drama, sex, problems, love,  and revenge. It is a good book. Read it for yourself. I liked the way the book ended.	2003-06-04

Baisden created every main character in the book with a different issue. I would say it is the men's version of Waiting to Exhale. One had baby momma drama, one liked only young girls, one had not commited to one woman....<BR>After reading the book I found myself wanting to know more about them. I didn't want the book to end. Reading the book was more like looking at a movie instead of reading a book. Read it, you won't be disappointed.	2003-06-04
US	31632406	RY816CJ5NA9D7	0446678872	734163607	Church Folk	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A getting by read	When I read the back of Church Folk and the reviews, I thought that I was in for so much laughter and amazement. Church folk was an o.k. read. It had its climaxes that would make you laugh, but overall it was a slow read. The author did a wonderful job describing the characters clothes and painting the pictures of the people in the book. The story was just slow. It is not a waste of time, but it is not on my favorites list.	2003-05-29

From the beginning to the end, it will keep your guessing, laughing, and wanting to read more. I read book, after book, and after reading ADDICTED, just any old book won't do. I get bored. Addicted is not at all predictable. Zane has a way with words that is like no other author. One of the best things about the book is that it is a combination; it has sex, romance, mistery, sadness, happiness. IT IS ALL THAT! I tell anybody that likes to read, if you never read another book, you have to read ADDICTED!!!!	2003-04-18
