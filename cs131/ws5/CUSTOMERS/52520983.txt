While I don't consider this two-book series (\\"Mad Merlin\\" and Lancelot du Lethe\\") one of the heavyweights of Arthurian retellings, I did find it pleasant and enjoyable.   I'm probably being a tad generous in handing out four stars instead of a more appropriate three, but I'm torn just enough to give Mr. King the benefit of the doubt.<br />This book both adheres to the stock story of Mallory and varies wildly from it.  It follows most of the major events of Mallory, such as the kidnapping of Guinevere, Lancelot's stewardship of the Joyous Garde, the birth of Galahad and his travails with the Holy Grail, and countless others.  Its major departure, however, lies in the Otherworld origins of both Guinevere and Lancelot, their joint history as changelings, and the ensuing betrothals at their births.  Mr. King uses these events to justify Lancelot and Guinevere's respective betrayals of Arthur and manages to have them all make nice-nice at the end.  The ultimate end of the story and the impending end of Lancelot's days were downright poignant.<br />This is really obscure, but I found myself thinking of the fabulous baseball movie, \\"Eight Men Out\\", after I finished this book.  The end that Lancelot came to in \\"Lancelot du Lethe\\" reminded me of the end that Shoeless Joe Jackson came to in the movie.  If you saw the movie, you'll know what I mean.  If not, I apologize for the oblique reference.<br />Anyway, I found this book to be a satisfactory addition to the genre of Arthurian literature and would recommend it to all fans.	2002-11-05

As an avid reader of the Arthurian legend, I am always thrilled to find a different \\"take\\" than the stock retellings.  And, in \\"Mad Merlin\\", J. Robert King has truly found a different take.  This tale is a veritable mind barrage of conflicting theologies and mythos.  Unfortunately, this strength was also a weakness for me.  Thought I enjoyed the story as a story, I always felt that I was missing something by not being as versed in Norse, Roman, and Greek mythology as the author expected me to be.  This is probably a personal problem, but anytime I see reference to Joseph Campbell, as I did in the liner notes of this book, I immediately think \\"dense and difficult\\".  I realize that this is a weakness on my part, but, hey, I'm giving my take right now. . .<br />None of this is to say I didn't like the book.  I enjoyed the alternative characterizations of Merlin as defrocked god and part-time madman, Guinevere as earth mother (a refreshing departure from many of the self-serving, vapid treatments we see all too often), and the more benevolent handling of Nyneve.  I have \\"Lancelot du Lethe\\" in my possession and it will be the next book I read.<br />My favorite version of Merlin is probably the old standby of Mary Stewart, and \\"Mad Merlin\\" has done nothing to change that.  But \\"Mad Merlin\\" is a welcome addition to the store of contemporary Arthurian literature and I, for one, appreciate every single one of them and enjoy the differences they offer.	2002-10-23

Though I would not consider \\"The Sword, the Ring, and the Chalice\\" a top-shelf series as far as fantasy trilogies go, I would place it no lower than the second tier.  It was placed in a world that is well-drawn and believable, as fantasy worlds go.  It had characters you could get close to - heroes you liked and villains that you liked to dislike.  My major complaint with the series is that Prince Gavril didn't get nearly what he deserved.  It had a romantic interest, though not overly sappy.  <br />It didn't make it as an epic in my book because, even though it was an enjoyable read, it was too easy.  Even though there were points of conflict and everything did not go 100% smoothly 100% of the time, you never felt that at any point the story was going to stray too far from the predictable ending.    Other than Pheresa's desire to be a queen at all cost, there were no real moral dilemma's raised or philosophical questions to ponder.<br />A little more meat on the bones would have made this a more memorable series, but even given that, it was fun to read and a series I would recommend to most any fan of fantasy, particularly those just becoming familiar with the genre.	2002-09-30

Even though I consider myself a fantasy fan extraordinaire, it took me over 20 years of reading to finally get to some of the seminal masterworks, namely the works of Fritz Leiber, in \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar\\" and \\"Lean Times in Lankhmar\\".  Although I would not consider these books among my all, all-time favorites, I am certainly glad I finally got to them, if only for their historical significance.  <br />I think that my favorite facet of these stories is trying to decide which characters and/or stories of more contemporary fantasy were based, to some degree at least, on Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.  My prime candidate is the delightful \\"Garrett, PI\\" series by Glen Cook.  Mr. Cook's city of Tunfaire is every bit the den of iniquity that Lankhmar is.  I'd also put the roguish, yet possessed of a heart of gold, Indiana Jones in this category.  I could be dead wrong, and there are probably many others, but these are the ones that I was reminded of.  <br />As I said, I'm glad I read the first two books and am anxiously looking forward to finding and reading the remaining tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.	2002-08-27

As a devotee of both the Arthurian legend and contemporary urban fantasy, this is the one book I've ever read that I wish I had written.  It is the best of the Arthurian crossover literature that I have ever read.  I will keep this review brief, as I don't want to take any more time as necessary from starting the next book, \\"The Broken Sword\\".  <br /> As I said, I would classify this genre as \\"Arthurian crossover\\", for want of a better term, as it brings the historical legend of King Arthur into modern times.  In this genre, Arthur truly is the \\"once and future\\" king.  The modern day characters of Arthur Blessing and Hal Woczniak and well written and heroic in every sense of the word.  The classic characters of Merlin and Nimue are a little off the traditionally beaten path, but are likewise well-written characters, as well as being truly delightful.  <br />As a disclaimer, the Arthurian segments are not as strong as a stand-alone story as the works of, say, Bernard Cromwell and Jack Whyte, nor are the contemporary segments as strong as the work of, say, Charles DeLint, but the combination is impeccable.  I truly wanted the good guys to win with all my heart and soul.  <br />I found the Arthurian segments to be very much like T. H. Whyte's \\"The Once and Future King\\", especially in the characterization of Merlin.  There was also a touch of Mary Stewart's \\"Merlin trilogy\\" in Merlin's lineage as the son of Ambrosius.  I particularly enjoyed the treatment of Nimue as a true innocent and found her relationship with Merlin as particularly touching.  It isn't always as benign as it is depicted in this book.  And the incorporation of the character of Salidin is a stroke of pure genius.  I had to look him up to find out that he was an actual historical personage, and he makes me wish I had paid more attention in high school World History class.<br />All in all, this is a great book and I am going to begin \\"The Broken Sword\\" as soon as I file this review.	2002-06-24

In this case, I make an exception.  \\"Vincalis the Agitator\\" is the best prequel I have read in recent memory, if not ever.  I will go so far as say that it strengthened the whole \\"Secret Texts\\" for me.<br />I was ever so ambivalent on the \\"Secret Texts\\" trilogy.  I suppose that's because parts of it reminded me too much of Elizabeth Haydon's \\"Rhapsody\\" trilogy, which I found to read one step ahead of a Harlequin Romance.  The \\"Secret Texts\\" were not as sappy, but did share several of the same traits, including making the heroine and hero a little too perfect and invincible for my tastes.  After reading \\"Vincalis\\", I feel I may or my not ever read anymore from Elizabeth Haydon, but I will certainly read more from Holly Lisle.<br />What did I like?  I found the characters less perfect, thus more accessible and believable.  Wraith had doubts.  Solander had doubts.  Jess had doubts.  The only principal characters who did not have doubts were the antagonists, and this cocksureness is one of the things that made them the bad guys.  I liked the story.  It is a tale of the mostly good against the mostly bad.  The world Ms. Lisle creates is a rich one based on primarily consistent principles of magic.  I know there are purists out there that can cite dozens of seeming inconsistencies, but I say \\"Get over it.\\"  We're talking about fantasy here - you want consistency, read a physics text instead.   <br />But what I really liked is the way that either story - the \\"Secret Texts\\" trilogy or \\"Vincalis\\" could be read first with no loss of impact.  I read them in the order they were published, hence I read \\"Vincalis\\" knowing roughly how it was going to turn out.  In that light, I found the reverence in which future Falcons in the \\"Secret Texts\\" were to hold Vincalis the Agitator to be somewhat ironic given the truth of Vincalis' birth and upbringing.  Someone reading \\"Vincalis\\" first can enjoy a similarly ironic unfolding of the plot.  In eithercase, the four books must be viewed as part of the same whole for maximum enjoyment.  I enjoyed the \\"Secret Texts\\" as an above-average fantasy series.  Throw in \\"Vincalis\\" and you have a very good fantasy series from a writer I will definitely read more of.	2002-06-18

I found this to be an enjoyable, well-written story, and quick read.  Had I had no prior knowledge of Terry Goodkind and the Sword of Truth and had no prior expectations, I would have been quite happy then and there.  But, (the biggest three-letter word in the English language), I was instead reminded of a period in my misspent youth when I often frequented smoky blues clubs.  A normal trick of the musicians and proprietors looking to bump up the night's profits was to drag out the appearance of the headlining musician as much as possible, enticing the patrons (such as myself) to purchase far more drinks than was good for them or their budgets.  The star's band would set up and play without him while the audience was teased and teased with the acting front man making veiled allusions to how \\"the blues man is in the house, I can feel his presence. . .<br />That was how I felt reading this book.  For about 600 pages we were teased and teased, waiting for Richard Rahl to make his appearance.  And worse yet, when he did, he didn't lay down any licks we hadn't heard before.  At least Buddy Guy and John Lee Hooker were worth hanging around for.  The new Lord Rahl's appearance in this gig was hardly worth either of our effort.<br />I think I see this book as a bridge in the series.  IMHO, it seems that the future direction is to emphasis the world more and the story of Richard and Kahlan less.  I can't think of any other legitimate reason why they were physically pushed so far to the background.  I know, I know, the specter of them permeated the whole book, but that's not the same as their presence.  For Pete's sake, they're fictional characters - it's not like they need a break between sets, er, I mean books!!  (At least John Lee Hooker was *old* the last time I saw him. . .   <br />I suppose the questions are \\"Have Richard and Kahlan outlived their usefulness?' and \\"Is the world of the Sword of Truth mature and strong enough to stand on it's own without them?\\"  As I'm out of blues cliches, I'll turn to one from the nightly news \\"Only time will tell.\\"	2002-04-27

I've read a lot of Arthurian retellings and have to count Bernard Cornwell's \\"Warlord\\" trilogy as one of the absolute best.  It truly has it all.  <br />The story adheres far more to the \\"historical\\" Arthur of Gildus, Nennius, Geoffrey of Monmouth and William of Malmesbury than the \\"romantic\\" Arthur of Mallory and Chretien des Troyes.  The Welsh and Irish influences are also strongly felt.  In Mr. Cornwell's  \\"historical\\" treatment, Arthur is not a king, but a Warlord.  Uther was Arthur's father, but Arthur did not share in Uther's legacy.  Merlin is a well-developed character, but is a wealthy lord and full Druid.  A cauldron, another powerful Celtic symbol, replaces the Holy Grail.  Finally, the sword was on the stone, not in the stone.     <br />But, the fact that the story can be told a multitude of ways, from a multitude of viewpoints, with a cast of both new and common characters points out the strength of the Arthurian legend and the Arthurian public's hunger for more.  Each retelling worth its salt (and this one is!!) provides it's own unique take on one of the best-loved legends of the English-speaking world.  <br />Even though Mr. Cornwell paints Arthur as a strong and (mostly) virtuous character, he still has flaws.  His willingness to forgive his enemies sometimes defies logic.  His modestly sometimes rings hollow.  But, all in all, he is the heroic figure we all have come to know and love.  The same cannot be said of Mr. Cornwell's Lancelot.  Suffice it to say that this is by far the least flattering portrait of the \\"world's greatest knight\\" that I have ever read.  Some of the other ancillary characters get a fuller treatment here than in many other versions of the tale and with some interesting transitions.  Guinivere, at least in my book, undergoes several personality transplants during the course of the trilogy, and some are for the better.  Nimue/Vivien is far more developed in this series and her transition also runs the full gamut.  Many of the other nobles and warriors are also well-painted characters and add a great deal to the overall enjoyment of the story.<br />But, the true measure of an Arthurian novel lies in the strength and credibility of the narrator.  Derfel is definitely one of the strongest voices I have heard in Arthurian literature.  He is now an aged monk, but in his younger years was a friend and confidant of Arthur who often fought by Arthur's side.  He is a sworn enemy of Lancelot, an angle that adds many new slants to the story.  But, most importantly, Derfel is telling the story in the past tense; he alludes to future events, tells us enough to let us know where it all leads, and then fills in the blanks.  In some respects, Derfel fills the role of Bedivere (which is all I'll say now so as not to spoil the story for those who haven't read the books yet).  <br />The writing is powerful, the story is spellbinding, and it achieves that delicate balance of retelling the familiar yet introducing a healthy dose of the new.  You just can't ask for anything more.	2002-04-10

As an avid reader of Arthurian literature, I am always pleased to find a retelling as vivid and well written as Bernard Cornwell's wonderful addition to the genre.  \\"The Winter King\\" exemplifies what keeps me coming back for more; it retains enough semblance to the generally accepted story line (that's if you're willing to buy into Mallory being the \\"definitive\\" modern source) to be \\"comfortable\\", but takes enough detours to be fresh and interesting.  Mallory tended to \\"sanitize\\" and romanticize the Welsh/Gaelic roots of the legends and introduced the chivalric element to the tales.  Mr. Cromwell keeps much of the original (pre-Mallory) roots intact and maintains some, though not all, of the Welsh and Gaelic spellings.  He makes references to many of the ancient treasures of Britain and other mythic allusions common to older Irish folklore and weaves them into his story.  (These allusions get stronger in the second book, \\"Enemy of God\\", which I'm currently reading, but I'm getting ahead of myself. . .)  And, though many of the names do remain the same and many of the classic characters appear, many of the relationships and characterizations are different than other retellings.  But, this variety is truly the spice of Arthurian life and makes it the rich store it is.  Arthur's parentage is far more humble, his relationship with Guinivere (at least so far) is far more cordial and Guinivere herself is a far fuller character, Lancelot is quite a different person, and Lancelot's relationship with Galahad is different.  (There are may more, but these are the ones that stand out to me.)<br />I said earlier that Mallory introduced chivalry to Arthurian literature.  Though there is a great deal of oath swearing in this book, there is not much chivalry and even less classic romanticism.  Oh, Arthur's attraction to Guiniverre is man/woman romantic enough, but the painting of the times is bleak.  I'm reminded of the movie \\"McCabe and Mr. Miller\\", a western movie that came out in the late 60's.  It was among the first of the \\"dusty\\" Westerns, in that it was not the romanticized old West of  John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart and Gene Autry.  It was dirty, dusty, harsh, and generally unpleasant (it's probably still my favorite western movie. . .).  \\"The Winter King\\" is to Mallory and that ilk of Arthurian literature as \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\\" was to \\"The Lone Ranger.\\"  You can actually feel and smell the filth. . .  Chivalry is replaced with opportunistic politicking, and Arthur is one of the worst offenders.<br />Merlin was actually a minor character in Mallory.  In this book, he is much more of a presence.  As a result, there is far more outward reference to magic in this story, too.  I say reference, because there's very little of the real thing.  Merlin is a full-fledged  Druid, but he, Morgan, and Nimue are seem (at least to me) to more shamans than true magicians.  But, if the peasants believe it's magic, does it really matter??<br />Another element central to this book is the religious conflict.  Historically, Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries would have been wracked by dissention between the Christians, proselytized by the Romans, and the Britons, still faithful to the pagan gods.  Merlin, of course, stands firmly on the side of the Old Gods and the Bishop Sansum is the kingpin of the Christians.  The ancient monk Derval, who narrates the book, was the child of a Saxon slave and raised by Merlin.  This story covers the period of his childhood and entry into manhood.  But, we know that after a lifetime as a warrior and pagan, he becomes a seemingly staunch disciple of Sansum, as his narration is retrospective.  Methinks therein lies a tale for the next two books of the series. . .<br />Finally, in my humble estimation, the trait that sets one Arthurian retelling above another is the strength of the character serving as the narrator.  Derval is fantastic.  He is a confidant of Arthur, Galahad, and Merlin - some pretty strong connections.  Yet, he is a sworn enemy of Lancelot, and certainly paints the most unflattering portrait of Lancelot that I have ever read.  I feel that this plot line will unfold differently than it seems, as I'm sure there are some surprises in the future relationship between Derval and Sansum.

As an avid reader of Arthurian literature, I am always pleased to find a retelling as vivid and well written as Bernard Cornwell's wonderful addition to the genre.  \\"The Winter King\\" exemplifies what keeps me coming back for more; it retains enough semblance to the generally accepted story line (that`s if you're willing to buy into Mallory being the \\"definitive\\" modern source) to be \\"comfortable\\", but takes enough detours to be fresh and interesting.  Mallory tended to \\"sanitize\\" and romanticize the Welsh/Gaelic roots of the legends and introduced the chivalric element to the tales.  Mr. Cromwell keeps much of the original (pre-Mallory) roots intact and maintains some, though not all, of the Welsh and Gaelic spellings.  He makes references to many of the ancient treasures of Britain and other mythic allusions common to older Irish folklore and weaves them into his story.  (These allusions get stronger in the second book, \\"Enemy of God\\", which I'm currently reading, but I'm getting ahead of myself. . .)  And, though many of the names do remain the same and many of the classic characters appear, many of the relationships and characterizations are different than other retellings.  But, this variety is truly the spice of Arthurian life and makes it the rich store it is.  Arthur's parentage is far more humble, his relationship with Guinivere (at least so far) is far more cordial and Guinivere herself is a far fuller character, Lancelot is quite a different person, and Lancelot's relationship with Galahad is different.  (There are may more, but these are the ones that stand out to me.)  <br />I said earlier that Mallory introduced chivalry to Arthurian literature.  Though there is a great deal of oath swearing in this book, there is not much chivalry and even less classic romanticism.  Oh, Arthur's attraction to Guiniverre is man/woman romantic enough, but the painting of the times is bleak.  I'm reminded of the movie \\"McCabe and Mr. Miller\\", a western movie that came outin the late 60's.  It was among the first of the \\"dusty\\" Westerns, in that it was not the romanticized old West of  John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart and Gene Autry.  It was dirty, dusty, harsh, and generally unpleasant (it's probably still my favorite western movie. . .).  \\"The Winter King\\" is to Mallory and that ilk of Arthurian literature as \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\\" was to \\"The Lone Ranger.\\"  You can actually feel and smell the filth. . .  Chivalry is replaced with opportunistic politicking, and Arthur is one of the worst offenders.<br />Merlin was actually a minor character in Mallory.  In this book, he is much more of a presence.  As a result, there is far more outward reference to magic in this story, too.  I say reference, because there's very little of the real thing.  Merlin is a full-fledged  Druid, but he, Morgan, and Nimue are seem (at least to me) to more shamans than true magicians.  But, if the peasants believe it's magic, does it really matter??<br />Another element central to this book is the religious conflict.  Historically, Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries would have been wracked by dissention between the Christians, proselytized by the Romans, and the Britons, still faithful to the pagan gods.  Merlin, of course, stands firmly on the side of the Old Gods and the Bishop Sansum is the kingpin of the Christians.  The ancient monk Derval, who narrates the book, was the child of a Saxon slave and raised by Merlin.  This story covers the period of his childhood and entry into manhood.  But, we know that after a lifetime as a warrior and pagan, he becomes a seemingly staunch disciple of Sansum, as his narration is retrospective.  Methinks therein lies a tale for the next two books of the series. . .  <br />Finally, in my humble estimation, the trait that sets one Arthurian retelling above another is the strength of the character serving as the narrator.  Derval is fantastic.  He is a confidant of Arthur, Galahad, and Merlin - some pretty strong connections.  Yet, he is a sworn enemy of Lancelot, and certainly paints the most unflattering portrait of Lancelot that I have ever read.  I feel that this plot line will unfold differently than it seems, as I'm sure there are some surprises in the future relationship between Derval and Sansum.  What I'm getting at is how truthful is the narration?  We know Derval is strongly opinionated.  I'm eager to read on to discover how much is \\"truth\\" and how much is Derval's perception and memory.  <br />And read the rest of the story, I will!  This is a strong book and a very welcome addition to the genre.	2002-03-30

I intentionally avoided reading too many reviews or articles on the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series because I really wanted to go into it fresh.  I had vague notions that it was a \\"children's'\\" story and that religion was in some way involved.  In retrospect, both of those notions were correct, but not nearly in the way that I expected.  The series was nothing like I had anticipated, but was so good that I stopped thinking about these differences in perception before I had finished reading the first chapter of the first book.<br />It is a child's story in that most of the main characters are children.  And while I feel that mature children can enjoy it, it sure isn't \\"Harry Potter\\".  (Disclaimer:  I have read and loved all four \\"Harry Potter\\" books and will read the next three as soon as they are published.)  And, it is about religion, but it sure isn't the New Testament.  In that sense, it also requires a mature reader to appreciate these books, as organized religion is not given a particularly happy face.  <br />There are other surprises.  Early on, the reader knows that the ubiquitous fight between ultimate good and ultimate evil is coming and it's going to be another big one, of Biblical proportions.  But the final denouement is so subtle, you have to go back and reread a few pages to be sure you didn't miss it.  Several other major plot crises are settled with this same air of subtlety.  I regard this phenomenon as one of the series' major strengths and feel that Philip Pullman is a literary genius to have pulled it off so consistently.<br />I wish I knew more of the history of the world's religions; I know I missed dozens of allusions that may have enhanced my understanding of some of the finer points of the story.  But even at that, there is much to enjoy in these books.  The characters of Lyra and Will were expertly drawn.  I'll try not to give away too much about the ending, but it had me, a grown, rather obese adult man, as misty-eyed as I've been in a while.(And it was a relatively happy ending!)  Other characters, such as Mrs. Coulter and Iorek Byrnison, the armored bear, were also vivid, complex, and interesting.  As in the works of George R. R. Martin, the good guys are not always totally good and the bad guys not always totally bad.  As in real life, shades of gray abound.   And the worlds Mr. Pullman created for this story are often fantastic, but not so much that they get in the way of the story.  Along these lines, the different races he invents, such as the Gyptians, the armored bears, and the mulefa are well developed enough that their traits both make sense and add to the story.  <br />I won't give away any more of the story so other readers can be as surprised as I was with these books.  I will say that this is the best fantasy series I have read so far this year and will let you find the rest out for yourselves.	2002-03-13

Once you get past the expenses, there are true advantages to having children in college.  You have these \\"agents\\" loose in literature classes, scouting out books you may have never thought you'd like or may never have read otherwise.  \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" was one of those books.  Several months ago, my son David urged me to read Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\".  I did, and I loved it.  So, for Christmas, he gave me \\"One Hundred years of Solitude\\", with the recommendation that it was very much like \\"Midnight's Children\\".<br />Once again, the kid was right.  Like Rushdie, I just assumed that Gabriel Garcia Marquez was too \\"literary\\" for a fantasy and SF reader like myself, who reads for enjoyment, not to (Heaven forbid!) learn anything.  Once again, I was pleasantly surprised.  Like Rushdie, Garcia Marquez is far more accessible, far funnier, and far more entertaining than I expected.  Even though I know nothing about the history of Colombia, I was still able to enjoy this book immensely, just on the surface level of a history of Macondo and the Bueneida family.  And what a family it is!!  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I say way too many members of my own family in there. . .<br />I will admit, that like other readers, the constant reuse of names periodically confused me and I was most grateful for the family tree printed in front of the book.  But, this reuse was somewhat central to the story, the \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same\\" syndrome.  As a fan of fantasy, I was able to take the \\"magic realism\\" in stride and enjoy it.  All in all, this was a great read and a great book.  <br />Once again I thank my son David and look forward to reading more Garcia Marquez as well as more Rushdie.  I'm glad to know his education dollars are being well spent.	2002-02-02
US	52520983	R1C4Q46NLQSFIW	0312140940	65783878	Wonder Boys: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good movie, good book. . .	I'm going to guess that most people who are reading this review are avid readers.  As such, most share the opinion that \\"the book is better than the movie\\".  Most of the time, I'm in that category my own self.  This is not to denigrate movies - I love movies.  In fact, two of my sons work in the movies.  (One supervises ushers in a theater at our local mall; the other is a clerk in a video rental store.)  But, but the very natures of the two media, books, by virtue of having no time constraints, can be far more descriptive and can delve deeper into ancillary sub-plots than movies can in the 1-1/2 to 2 hour time slot they're given.  Two recent movies that I feel were excellent films though didn't measure up to the source books were \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\\".  Both were long movies, yet still had to necessarily leave out many (sometimes-quirky) sub-plots.   <br />Every so often, I come upon a case when I find myself saying, \\"The movie was better.\\"  Two instances that come immediately to mind are \\"Cannery Row\\" and \\"Field of Dreams\\".   These are two of my favorite movies of all time and both share an ethereal, fantastic quality.  When I read \\"Wonder Boys\\", I felt a strong sense that this one could ultimately fall onto that short list.  The strong ending of the book probably prevented it from doing so, but I'm still going have to straddle the fence on this one and open a new category in my rating system, that where I enjoyed them equally, though for different reasons.  <br />The movie, though it covered the same dissolution of writer Grady Tripp's latest marriage and his attempt to achieve the past promise that always seems to allude him, it evoked more humor, often in a slapstick way.  The dog humor in the movie rivaled two of my other favorites in this obscure sidelight, \\"There's Something About Mary\\" and the most recent remake of  \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\".  Where Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket ended up was a far more romantic twist in the movie than the practical resolution in the book. <br />But, to finally turn to the book. . .  This is a story of a writer writing about writers and writing.  Often times, this is a genre only understood and appreciated by other writers.  Michael Chabon manages to pull it of in a way that is accessible and enjoyable to we lay folk.  Grady Tripp is a writer who has met with some critical acclaim but is not yet a household name.  This book describes the final days of his work on his magnum opus, the one that will bring him the fame he so richly deserves.  Unfortunately, the book is 2611 pages long, not nearly finished, and his publisher is in town to collect the goods.  Add to the fact that Grady's third wife has just left him, his paramour is pregnant, his mind is addled by years of various substance abuse, and his top student shot Grady's boss's dog, we have a recipe for incipient disaster.  And, most of it is realized.  <br />Grady Tripp truly is a wastrel, but still manages, in my book, to be a sympathetic and heroic character.  His dissipation is epic, but he resists the popular temptation to blame others for it.  By the end of the book, Grady is able to look at himself in the mirror, take responsibility for what he sees and what he has done, and begins the reclamation effort he deems necessary.  In essence, he becomes one of the \\"Wonder Boys\\" that are the title characters of his latest, disastrous novel.  Though some of the other characters are strongly drawn, none is as well depicted as Grady.  Returning briefly to the book vs. movie comparison, a character that I feel has much more depth in the book that served only as a comic foil in the movie was Doctor Dee, the blind dog.  In the book, we are given much more insight that the movie provided to the point of downright poignancy. . .  You have to red the book to see what I mean. . .<br />And, I do feel you should read the book.  I saw the movie, read the book, and received thesoundtrack CD for Christmas.  I enjoyed all three equally well, and it's not often I can say that.	2002-01-20

I fell for the hype that Tim Dorsey was the next Carl Hiaasen when I bought and read his first book, \\"Florida Roadkill\\".  I was disappointed, but not disappointed enough to swear him off completely.  After \\"Hammerhead Ranch Motel\\", I am.  Tim Dorsey is Carl Hiaasen without soul or at least without heart.  <br />Let me list my complaints, one by one:<br />Giving characters humorous names and nicknames and putting them in absurdly zany situations does not make a book funny.  There is no real plot continuity, only a series of \\"let's see how crazy I can make this one\\" events.  <br />Not to keep harping on how superior Carl Hiaasen is to Tim Dorsey, but Hiaasen's books are truly satire.  He is not afraid to systematically take on Florida's leading icons - developers, theme parks and the tourist industry in general, the Lotto and people who play it, cosmetic surgeons, and the drug industry.  Each of his books focuses primarily on one of these topics.  Tim Dorsey includes each of these in every one of his books, but strictly stereotypically and gratuitously.   It almost seems like he feels these are the components one needs for \\"Florida humor\\", so the more you throw in, the funnier it is.<br />The Johnny Vegas subplot is pointless.  He has appeared in both of the first two books to absolutely no purpose but to add bulk and sophomoric sexual titillation to the books.  If these sections were totally excised, there would be absolutely no loss to the stories.  <br />There's a severe geographic dissociation.  Hiaasen sets his stories in Miami and South Florida, where life truly is faster paced and the air really does crackle with an electric sub-current.  Dorsey places his in Tampa-St. Pete, a haven for Mid-western transplants, and tries to make it seem like Miami.  (Tampa Bay residents, please don't flood my e-mail with nasty rejoinders - I live in the Tampa Bay area my own self and have for 18 years. . .)  <br />As a resident of the Tampa Bay area, wheremost of the story takes place, I was amused by the references to local streets and landmarks, and I must admit they did catch my interest - the first 50 times or so.  Readers from Pittsburgh could care less about how many times characters crossed the Gandy Bridge or drove the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway or went to Davis Island, just as readers in Tampa-St. Pete could care less how many times a character in a book set in Pittsburgh crossed the West End Bridge, drove down the McArdle Roadway, or went to Point Park.  Setting is important, but should not be the dominant feature of a book.<br />The book did have is enjoyable moments, and at no point did I feel compelled to throw it across the room.  But this should not be the only positive one derives from a book.  Perhaps one day I'll find \\"Orange Crush\\" at a garage sale and I may buy it.  Until then, I will look to Carl Hiaasen, Laurence Shames, Dave Barry, and the occasional Elmore Leonard placed in Miami for my fix of \\"South Florida crazy\\" literature.	2001-12-19

Just when I thought I might be finding the Sister Fidelma novels a touch repetitive, I read \\"Valley of the Shadow\\" and my faith was restored.  Of the first six novels of the series, I have to brand this one my favorite.<br />Although it carries the flavor of the previous novels, it breaks some new ground.  Without ruining the suspense, I will intimate that Brother Eaudulf plays his most major role, Fidelma herself makes some wrong assumptions, and the good Sister finds herself in an unaccustomed position for a time.  <br />And, for the traditional-spirited, the story carries the usual Celtic lore of the period, delves into the usual intrigue, and has you wondering who done it till the final pages.  As I said, I've read them all, and recommend each book of the series, especially this one, to one and all.	2001-12-06

I found myself torn on how many stars I wanted to give this series.  I felt that the plot and characters (with some trepidation, which I will explain later,) deserved at least four.  And, with one exception, the writing was solid.  That exception was that there were entirely too many words.   That fact also brings me to my biggest gripe of how those words were used - to turn what could have been a modern fantasy classic into a Harlequin Romance.  That really turned me off.  For that, I wanted to go no more than 2 stars.  I wish I could have given out 3-1/2 stars to rate the book as above average, but since I'm a nice guy (even though I'm not a fan of romance novels) I compromised at 4 instead of 3.  <br />What I'm trying to say is that I really enjoyed these books (\\"Rhapsody\\", \\"Prophecy\\" and \\"Destiny\\") but feel that there were potentially fatal flaws that I hope Elizabeth Haydon can remedy before she writes any more fantasy novels.  Or, if that's not her nature, perhaps she can turn to romance novels exclusively - I'm sure she'll do it well.<br />Ostensibly, this series was concerned with three characters - Achmed, Grunthor, and Rhapsody - and, at the beginning, it seemed that each would get equal billing.  After all, the first book was alternately titled \\"Child of Blood\\" (i. e., Achmed) and the second \\"Child of Earth\\" (i., e., Grunthor).  Then, while reading the second book, I realized that the \\"Child of the Sky\\", i.e., Rhapsody, was getting all the press.  This was also when the series turned from pure fantasy to fantasy adulterated with romance and gratuitous sex.  By way of explanation, I do not consider myself a prude - my favorite series' these days are George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" and Jack Whyte's \\"Camulod Chronicles\\".  Anyone who's read those books or the reviews on Amazon knows that fantasy can be brutal, backstabbing, adult-themed, and good.  It seemed to me that half of the second book of this series (\\"Prophecy\\") was dedicated to play-by-play accounts of Rhapsody and Ashe's trysts at Elysian and elsewhere.  Was the writing titillating?  Yes.  Was it necessary to advance the plot?  To a degree, yes.  Was it incredibly overdone?  YES.  In book two, entire pages were spend describing the colors of Rhapsody and Ashe's eyes.  In book three, Rhapsody and Achmed went from finding two of the F'dor-spawn to nine in the space of one sentence.  Am I the only one that finds this extreme??<br />It's fairly obvious that Rhapsody and Ashe were Elizabeth Haydon's favorite characters and she lost all semblance of reality and practicality in making them larger than life itself as the story went on.  Rhapsody was a truly amazing woman, but she lost all credibility when I realized that every decision she made was to ease more and more of the pain and suffering of the rest of the world and took it on herself.  Nobody is that altruistic, plain and simple.  Add to the fact that she was expert in everything she did and was skilled in every form of magic known in the world.  Same with Ashe, though to a lesser degree.  Give me a break. . . <BR>I found myself reminded of Ayla in Jean Auel's \\"Earth Children\\" series.  You remember Ayla, don't you?  She invented fire, the wheel, mathematics, the sling as a hunting weapon, the domestication of animals, and nuclear fission - all before breakfast.  This was the way Elizabeth Haydon painted Rhapsody.  And, the sad thing is, I don't think it was intentional, but a labor of misguided love.<br />OK, so Elizabeth Haydon is not the only one who uses too many words - I'm almost done.  This truly is a good series, all in all.  The intrigue involved with Achmed setting himself up as king of the Firbolg and the machinations of a certain holy man who's name I won't reveal for the sake of those who haven't read the last two books yet were very well done.  The histories the Ms. Haydon created of the old world and the new were works of creative genius.  I'm glad I read these books and will recommend them to anyone (with caveats, of course.)  I feel that they could have been even better and the same story told in 1/3 to 1/2 of the pages.  I apologize to any romance readers I might have offended and invite them to point me to any other romantic fantasy that they feel I should try.  But, unless Elizabeth Haydon focuses more on the fantasy than on the romance, her books will not be filling my shelves.	2001-12-02

This is the fifth Sister Fidelma book I have read, and the highest complement I can pay Peter Tremayne is that I've started reading my sixth.  As a fan of medieval fantasy and Arthurian literature, I find the Sister Fidelma books right up my alley.  Mr. Tremayne captures the spirit and essence of the times and turns them advantage in telling his tales.  I truly feel I have been transported to 7th Century Ireland!  Mr. Tremayne's other life as a Celtic historian and scholar gives these books a realism they might not otherwise have.<br />\\"The Spider's Web\\" continues in the vein of the previous novels.  Sister Fidelma is called in as an advocate to ensure justice is done in the case of a murder.  In the spirit of all great detective series', things are not what they seem.  The good sister delves deeper and deeper into the web, this time, as in others, with her sidekick Brother Eaudulf.  More often than not, Fidelma and Eaudulf make enemies as they draw closer and closer to the truth.  The web grows curiouser and curiouser until the final denouement.  Simple, not particularly original, but still effective!  And the plot in this novel is indeed a tangled spider's web.<br />To pat myself on the back, I was able to solve this one on my own, before having it spelled out to me.  But, am I ready to leave Florida to become a 7th Century Irish religious sleuth.  I don't think so, but Sister Fidelma is the only person who could actually make me consider it!!	2001-12-02

As a confirmed fan of the Arthurian Legend and the various retellings, I should probably like this series more than I do. I can't claim that it's because I'm a traditionalist - one of my favorite retellings is Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's three-book subset of her Keltiad series known as \\"The Tales of Arthur\\". For those of you who haven't read it, it's a great series referred to by both to the author and its aficionados as \\"Celts in Space\\", so use your imagination. And, it's not because A. A. Attanasio's series is poorly written. The prose is lyrical, yet strong, and the characterizations are full. I think it may be because even though the series is original and the setting non-traditional, it reaches too far for my personal tastes. In this series, Arthur (or, Arthor, as he starts out), is certainly a featured character, but not the main one. Arthur's tale is lost in the maze of all the immortals in all the galaxies in all the universes of the cosmos. The story has its beginning in the beginning of time when all was chaos. To keep it brief, Merlin starts out as the demon Lailoken, spawn of Lucifer along with the others of his ilk, who through a series of miraculous events is given birth as a human living backwards in time, i.e., his body grows younger as time progresses. As a result, Merlin sheds his demonic ways, becomes a devout Christian, and is tasked with guiding Arthor on his quest of uniting the British Isles under the umbrella of Christianity.  Opposing him are the Furor and the old (pagan) gods. The Furor is Odin and his cohorts the rest of the cadre of the Norse deities. Throw in the Firelords (i.e., the \\"good\\" angels), the immortal Nine Queens of Avalon, and the elfin Daione Sid, and you have a battle royale par excellence. Oh, and throw in the fact additional fact that the earth `s core is formed by a sleeping dragon who is cosmically connected to every other dragon that forms the core of every other planet in the Creation. . . As many of the characters are gods or have god-like characters, time tripping abounds and everyone, save the puny mortal humans, can see the future and has their own ways of trying to prevent the holocaust they all foresee. The fact that they all have different ideas about how to accomplish this is what provides the conflict that makes the story go. Mr. Attanasio tells the story far better than I do, but I find the constantly shifting points of view to be difficult to follow. I like the straight-ahead descriptions of Arthur's dealings well enough, but tend to get lost and gloss over the philosophical and mystical mumbo-jumbo. Also, there are some incongruities with the mainstream Arthurian legend that seem to serve no real purpose, or none that I'm smart enough to discern. The Fisher King appears in the book, but Arthur's the one with the wound that will not heal. Call me an ignorant, lowbrow Philistine, and that's OK with me. I like thoughtful fantasy, but a little sword and sorcery floats my boat, too. As I intimated earlier, I don't dislike these books. I've read all four to date, and will read any more that are published. Which brings up another question in my mind - this book has a complete enough ending that it could be the last in the series. However, it leaves us at the very beginning of Arthur's reign. Will there be more? I can't tell. . . The books are well written and mostly enjoyable. They are a strong addition to the store of Arthurian lore that exists. There not my personal favorites, but I do recommend that anyone who enjoys Arthurian literature at all give them a try and formulate their own opinion.	2001-08-28

For some reason, I thought that Salman Rushdie was one of those &quot;literary&quot; writers that could only be appreciated by English majors.  I was fascinated by his life of exile and respected him, but could never bring myself to reading him.<br />Then, my son David and my wife Mary both read the book, along with some of David's friends.  They all raved about it.  Since my family knows my literary tastes better than anyone and were so insistent I would like the book, I had no choice but to give it a try.<br />Once, again, they were right.  The book was a joy to read, and far more accessible, interesting, and funny than I had would have expected.  The narration by Saleem Sinai is priceless.  The story is told mostly chronologically with just enough tangential stream of consciousness ramblings and foretellings to stay interesting.  The premise (the tale of those 1001 children born within the first hour of India's independence) was a stroke of genius.  The fact that I learned a lot about Indian and Pakistani history was a bonus. <br />The only downside was that the story began to slow down a bit at the end, but since it was essentially the story of the birth of a nation (two, actually), the author couldn't possibly be expected to keep up the fever pitch he began at.  All in all, it was a great read and a great story and I, for one, will be sure to read more of Mr. Rushdie's work!!	2001-08-21

I read several reviews of this book several years ago and received several more word-of-mouth reviews since them.  All were raves.  The facts that the book was out-of-print and hard to get added to the mystique.  So, when I saw the book on a friend's shelf, I was beside myself with rapture, and immediately borrowed the book and read it.<br />Though it was a good story, true to the ballad, and beautifully written, it was not the religious experience I was anticipating.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, I just don't know. But mostly, I did not find Thomas to be a particulary sympathetic character,  The people that loved him did not find their love returned, I fear.  Thomas was a touch too self-centered for my tastes.  <br />All in all though, I'm glad I finally found and read the book.  I would recommend it to all fantasy fans and fans of Celtic/Scottish/British folklore if for no other reason than &quot;historic&quot; relevance.	2001-08-21

Once upon a time, I regarded the publication of a Tom Robbins novel as cause for joyous celebration.  Then, the temptation is to say that I \\"grew up\\" and Tom's books lost their picaresque charm for me.  I continued to read them, but the thrill was gone - just so many words on a page, seemingly not going anywhere.  Then, my son David's friend Robert (19 years old) started showing up at the house with Tom Robbins books, gushing with praise for this author he had just \\"discovered\\".  Discussions with Robert rekindled the fires for me, and when I picked up \\"Fierce Invalids\\" after a five-year hiatus from Tom Robbins, lo and behold, the time was right and the magic was back!  I'm not even going to try to determine if Mr. Robbins grew up or if I regressed.  It just doesn't matter.<br />What does matter is that \\"Fierce Invalids\\" is the quintessential Tom Robbins.  There are those skeptics that say the plot doesn't go anywhere.  In a manner of speaking, they could be right.  The conclusion could be perceived as indecisive, but, if the reader paid any attention at all to the clues about the character of Switters, the protagonist, it couldn't have ended any other way.  After all, that's Switters.  <br />In this book, as in any other Tom Robbins story, the joy is in the journey, not the destination.  To attempt to describe the plot would be a disservice.  There is the usual cast of misfits with character flaws getting into and out of zany situations.  In this case, it's CIA cowboys and angels, South American shamans, excommunicated nuns, underage step-sisters, long lost relics and works of art (in this case, the third prophecy of Fatima and an original Matisse with a story), and Islamic terrorist wanna-bes.  We spend time in Peru, Syria, Seattle, Sacramento, and the Vatican.  We are teased with philosophical ramblings.  All in all, it's the usual Tom Robbins romp.  <br />So what's the attraction?? (Another roadside attraction?)  As I said earlier, the joy is in the journey.  And, it is a linguistic journey.  Reading a Tom Robbins book is like taking a shower in a sound studio.  You just let stand and let the rhythm of the words cascade over you.  Mr. Robbins uses words as though they were blunt instruments and wields metaphors as if they were violins.  (By the way, I have no idea what that means, either.  .)  It's like eating popcorn.  It tastes great while you're doing it, you can't get enough of it, and when it's gone, you're pleasantly sated but not bloated.  It's not literature for the ages, but it's a good read for right now.  Sailor Boy, one of the pivotal characters in the story said it best, \\"Peeple of the wurl, relax.\\"	2001-07-29
US	52520983	R2C0MKXCW4BCJO	0441626831	371597098	On Stranger Tides	Books	5	41	43	N	N	Another rip-roaring yarn. . .	My friend Dean and I regard Tim Powers as one of today's best writers that hardly anyone knows.  We can only hope loyal readers such as ourselves using forums such as this one can get the word of Mr. Powers vast talents out to the masses!!<br />Interestingly enough, though this is one of Mr. Powers' earlier works, it's the one I waited the longest to read.  No apparent reason, but I wish I wouldn't have waited so long.  It fits right in with the author's penchant for offbeat plots.  In the past, Mr. Powers has written about ghost hunters, gamblers with a sense of the occult, and other eccentricities.  \\"On Stranger Tides\\" introduces us to the world of Caribbean pirates with a bent for the occult.  It is not as dark as other Tim Powers novels, but is every bit as powerful and entertaining.<br />The story takes place in the early 18th century and is a confabulation.  That is, it is a work of fiction that includes in its cast, actual, historical personages who lived during the time.  In this book, one-time Bahamian governor Woodes Rogers, infamous pirates Stede Bonnet and Edward Thatch a.k.a.  Blackbeard, Colonel William Rhett, the Receiver General of the Carolina Province, and a wildly anachronistic Juan Ponce de Leon, cross paths, and sometimes swords with the unlikely buccaneer, Jack Shandy, Phil Davies, the pirate with a heart of gold, and Benjamin Hurwood, a one-time Oxford don gone insane with grief over the death of his wife Margaret.  As always, Mr. Powers' research and attention to detail shine through as we are given lessons in history, geography, and voodoo while we follow the romps of the picaresque heroes of this book.  Yes, the pirates are the heroes. . .<br />Which brings me to one of my favorite characters of the book, Jack Shandy, who was born John Chandagnac, spent time touring Europe with his father as Shakespearean puppeteers, became an accountant when his father died, and, finally, became the most unlikely pirate captain to sail the seven seas.  Forced to run afoul of the law in order to protect the beautiful, yet innocent, Beth Hurwood from the evil machinations of her deranged father, Shandy espouses the philosophical side of this novel.  Jack means to remain a law-abiding citizen, but, when given the chance, he seems to always make the legally-wrong-yet-morally-right choice.  In that sense, Jack's plight rivals that of Scott Crane in Mr. Powers' excellent \\"Last Call\\".  Mr. Powers captures the essence of the less-than-pure hero as well as anyone writing today.  In his world, Everyman can shine, even if his intentions are not always pure and noble.<br />My only gripe, if I can call it that, is that, like in his other novels, Mr. Powers delves into a level of esoteria and detail that only a historian or shaman can appreciate.  It's almost like he's telling his readers that, no matter how much they know, he knows a little more.  But, that's a small price to pay for the chance to enjoy some of the most innovative fiction being written today.  If you've never read any of the works of Tim Powers, this is a fine place to start.	2001-07-18
US	52520983	R140JPB1HJU9OR	0312192339	531409019	Incident at Twenty-Mile	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Story-telling at it's finest. . .	First of all, for the past 20 years, I have read fantasy and SF almost exclusively.  So, when my wife suggested I read this book, I would have never given it a second thought, except for the fact that she&#8217;s usually always right.  And I&#8217;m glad I went with my husbandly instinct, because this is one great book!!<br />I have read very few westerns in my life.  The short list consists of &#8220;The Virginian&#8221;, &#8220;Lonesome Dove&#8221;, and the little-known, yet excellent. &#8220;Monty Walsh&#8221;.  But, on closer retrospection, I realized that these books, though placed in the American West of the 19th Century, are primarily books about people.  And, they are books about seemingly ordinary people in harsh times.  Their beauty is in how these people deal with or, if necessary, overcome their conditions.  &#8220;Incident at Twenty-Mile&#8221; neatly falls into this same category. <br />I must also say that the author is a storyteller *par excellence*.  This is both one of the best and best-written books I have read in a long, long time.  I was captivated by the first pages and never felt let down.  The narrative is in some ways documentary, but keeps taking twists and bends along the way.  The characters come alive as the story unfolds.  We start in a town that is well on its way to becoming a ghost town.  We meet the seemingly normal people that inhabit it.  Then, the mysterious stranger comes to town. . .   But, it&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking!!  We have some ideas about Matt, the stranger as time goes on, but we&#8217;re not really sure where we&#8217;re being led.  What does happen, though, is that during each conversation he has with one of the townsfolk, a little more of the veneer comes off of the characters.  Before we know it, everyone in town is revealed as a &#8220;damaged&#8221; person, to use the author&#8217;s own term.  <br />The book is essentially Matt&#8217;s story, and he plays out the hand he feels he was dealt.  He adopts the townspeople as his responsibility and protects them, as he feels is his destiny.  I&#8217;ll let you all read the story to see how that all comes out with my only *caveat* being it&#8217;s not what you might expect.  This is a masterful story told by a master.  Suffice it to say, I&#8217;m glad the Kleenex box was handy when I finished the book.<br />Some earlier reviewers find fault with this book by questioning is &#8220;authenticity&#8221; and by pointing out seeming anachronisms.  Hey, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called *fiction*. . .  I have quoted Don Henley in some of my prior reviews on Amazon.com, and will most likely continue to do so &#8211; &#8220;Get over it. . .&#8221;   This story could have been set in any place or period and it would still be a great story.  It works in the west because the harshness of the environment and the borderline lawlessness implicit in the times give it the framework and room it needs to develop.  I have faith the author could have place it in Victorian England and that it still would have been as strong.<br />All in all, this is as good a book as I have ever read, and I&#8217;ve read a lot.  If you&#8217;re not a western fan, don&#8217;t sweat it &#8211; neither am I.  But if you love a great story, great characters, and a great read, this one&#8217;s for you.	2001-07-07

In \\"Otherland\\", he has proved himself as adept in epic SF as he is in epic fantasy.  This volume is certainly a worthy close to a fantastic series.  All the loose ends are tied up - sometimes perhaps a little too neatly in that some characters tend to make miraculous recoveries from near-death experiences.  But these instances are balanced by Mr. Williams refusal to turn the story into a fairy tale by not having everyone live happily ever after - not everyone's situation is neatly resolved.  I won't go into anymore detail in deference to those who are reading this before they try the book. <br />Although the \\"Circle\\" perhaps fizzles a bit in this installment (no new ground is broken here), the unveiling of the true nature of the \\"Other\\" is very well done.  In some ways it is a surprise, but it is one of those \\"neat\\" points I mentioned earlier in that it very tidily brings all the main characters together for the final dénouement.   And, suffice it to say, Johhny Dread gets his.  <br />The interrelationships started in the earlier books blossom, and one that develops between Paul and Martine, the two adventurers most affected by the \\"Other\\" is also touching.  By the end of the tale, even Long Joseph and Del Ray have become sympathetic characters.  <br />And, the exploration of the philosophical questions \\"What is life?\\" and \\"Is there no end to corporate greed?\\" continues, as well as \\"How far will certain megalomaniacs go in their search for immortality?\\"<br />One of the cool touches of the book is one that I really didn't appreciate till the end of this book.  That is the little \\"netfeed\\" blurbs that precede each paragraph.  They provide true insight into the period in time in which this story occurs. <br />I will miss my new-found friends in \\"Otherland\\" and would caution any would-be readers that you must be prepared to invest a lot of time and a lot of thought into this journey.  But, 3000+ pages after it began, I must rate it as one I am glad I have taken.	2001-07-04

To quote a phrase from one of the sim worlds that we've visited in this series, things just keep getting \\"curiouser and curiouser\\".  In this installment of the extended novel \\"Otherland\\", many of the mysteries raised previously are solved, yet many other are introduced.<br />We learn more of the natures of both the \\"Other\\" and the \\"Circle\\".  We visit more fantastic sim worlds, including ancient Greece and a House that would be any realtor's wildest dream.  The main characters are reunited, or in some instances, united for the first time, albeit for only a brief time.  We learn the identities of the enigmatic Emily and of Paul Jonas' \\"Angel\\" (or do we?), though many mysteries still remain.  We get some ideas of the ambitions of both the Grail Brotherhood and of the evil Johnny Dread, though both are still left hanging into book four. .  And, still, we are left to wonder, who exactly is Azador?<br />At the same time as the adventurers are loose in Otherland, however, much is happening back in RL (Real Life, to the uninitiated).  Two detectives in Sydney are heating up a once cold trail in a murder that occurred years ago.  Renie's father and old flame find themselves unexpectedly united against a sinister enemy.  The military family, the Sorensons, find their lives have decidedly taken a turn for the weird.  A retired Uncle Jingle begins to hear voices and is drawn to a destination she can't quite explain.  Two families of children lost in a world they can't imagine continue their lonesome vigils.  And an ordinary lawyer from Washington, DC, finds himself connected to almost all of the others.<br />The characters and their interrelationships continue to grow.  The poignancy of the relationships between Orlando and Fredericks and Renie and !Xabbu deepen to the point of bringing tears to the eyes of the less jaded among us.  Florimel and T4b likewise become more real to us.<br />But to me, the added value of this book and a certain maturation of the plot occur as Tad Williams adds a philosophical bent to the tale.  The validity of war as a solution to the world's problems is questioned.  The questions of corporate greed and the profit motive are raised as multinational conglomerates trample the needs, values, and lives of the masses of humanity.  And, a little more esoterically, ethical questions are raised concerning the rights and existences of AI constructs, sort of a \\"where does life truly begin\\" dilemma.<br />As the two books before this one, it is definitely not a stand-alone.  But, if you've made it this far, you're into the home stretch and I am confident that the ride will be worthwhile!	2001-06-16

As the next part of the same whole, it continues to deliver and to hold my interest.  The plots are advanced, and several new twists evolve.  We are exposed to more members of the mysterious \\"Circle\\" and we begin to get a glimpse of the power of the dread \\"Other\\".<br /> We are given more insight into the characters, which is something that I need in a novel to consider it to be truly great.  I particularly enjoyed the deepening of the relationship between Orlando and Fredericks and the cracking of Martine's shell.  I must also admit the identity of the mole in the group surprised me. . .  It was not who I expected it to be.  The hunt for the murderer in Australia is also a nice touch, and I look forward to seeing where that goes in the future books.  And, who exactly is Azador?<br />But what I enjoyed the most are the quirky new sim worlds to which we are taken - Oz, Xanadu, Renaissance Venice, a 40's vintage cartoon, and an insect world that almost smacks of Jurassic Park.  The Grail Brotherhood may smack of evil, but they have some style!!  The fact that Mr. Williams has to know that some of this is camp yet charges there anyway convinces me that he has a rather eclectic sense of humor, another trait that I personally admire. <br />This book is definitely not a stand-alone.  You must read \\"City of Golden Shadow\\" to get here, and you must be willing to go on to the next two.  The upside is that having read this installment, I have no hesitation in charging on to number 3, \\"Mountain of Black Glass\\".	2001-06-02

After reading the series \\"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn\\" several years ago, I mentally noted Tad Williams as fantasy-writing force to remember.  Even though that series fit the stock formula fairly well, it did it with panache.  The heroes were not morally squeaky-clean and were a little rough around the edges.  That is to say, they were living, breathing people who would have fit in with the masses of humanity in any era.  They were Everyman thrust into extraordinary circumstances.<br />So, when I saw that Mr. Williams' next series strayed from the realm of fantasy, I feared that he might be over-reaching himself.  I was a fool to have worried.  Although I have only read the first book of \\"Otherworld\\" so far, I have to place Mr. Williams in that small group of writers (Jules Verne, Stephen Donaldson, Robert Silverberg, Gene Wolfe, and a few others) that have been able to produce masterworks in both the fantasy and SF genres.<br /> And what SF it is!  For a half-baked synopsis, we are thrust into the middle of the 21st century, where the entire planet Earth has become an electronic global village for those of enough means to afford it.  What we think of as today's world-wide web has grown beyond all bounds and has practically taken on a visceral presence.  To those with good enough equipment, the net has supplanted the physical world as their place to shop, to sight see, and to seek pleasures undreamed of in real life (or, RL as it is known to the citizenry of the day).  Of course, as is always the case, much of the world's population still lives at a third-world level while the super wealthy have managed to transcend even the bounds of the known net to devise their own fantastic playland, known to the few who are aware of it as Otherland.  The creators of Otherland are performing some evil deeds that somehow involves trapping pre-teen and teenage hackers in a state of stasis for some yet unknown sinister purpose.  The story centers around a group of friends and relatives of some of the kids imprisoned in the net, others with axes to grind against the founders of Otherland, and a few rouge constructs loose in the net that are out to bring down the powers that be.  I don't think I've given anyway any secrets that will decrease your enjoyment of the book. <br />Does this sound suspiciously cyberpunk, or what?  But, it is cyberpunk with panache.  Mr. Williams shamelessly mixes in a little \\"Jack in the Beanstalk\\", a little \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", a taste of Philip Jose Farmer's \\"Riverworld\\", and just enough \\"Martian Chronicles\\" to know it's there.  It is cyberpunk with a sense of humor, but also with a sense of dread.  As is the case with George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\", this is not a series for everyone.  It is intense and some characters come to rather gruesome ends.  It is not quite as graphic as Mr. Martin's series, but there are some unsettling moments.  Having said that, I will also say that it's no more frightening than anything else in the genre, so take that as you may.  Also, like Martin's series, each book is a segment of the larger whole, hence the book ends with a cliff-hanger.  I don't know about you, but I prefer this to a contrived resolution at the end of each book just for neatness sake that could blow the whole flow of the story.<br />The main characters are sometimes a little rough, but are sympathetic.  They have their times when nothing will go down better than a cigarette and a beer, but they also have their moments of nobility.  The advances in computer networks and virtual reality are a reach from today's technology, but are plausible (a main requirement for high quality SF).  And, I say this as a career systems engineering professional.  There is only one instance of *deus ex machina* concerning the character Dread, but it does help advance the plot so nicely that it can be overlooked.  There was one section of the book that almost stuck me as being cartoonish, but I felt a tad  (groan. . .) of vindication when Mr. Williams used the same adjective in the synopsis of this book that appears in the second book of the series.  The high points so far outweigh the low that I feel almost criminal mentioning them. . .<br />I have had this book in my possession for several years now but waited until all four books of the series were in print to begin reading.  So far, the wait has been worthwhile because I'm not planning on slowing down my enjoyment of this series for anything!!	2001-05-07

After finishing the first six books of the Camulod Chronicles, I was both delighted and confused to see that the publication of a seventh book was imminent.  Delighted because I regard Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles to be one of the best retellings of the Arthurian legend, confused because the title was \\"Uther\\".  By the end of book 6, \\"The Sorcerer:  Metamorphosis\\", Uther is long dead and his son Arthur just installed as High King of all of Britain.  I ignored the anachronism and ordered the book anyway.<br />My faith in Jack Whyte was rewarded as \\"Uther\\" turned out to be one of the crowning jewels (sick pun intended) of the Camulod Chronicles.  In the time line, \\"Uther\\" covers the same period as book 3 of the series, \\"The Eagle's Brood\\".  Where \\"The Eagle's Brood\\" was told from the point of view of Merlyn, \\"Uther\\" is told from the point of view of. . .  Uther.  I suppose this book can be considered an alternative historical fiction, but I won't go there. . .<br />This book continues in the same sweeping, luxurious style of the others in the series with the only difference being in narration.  The first two books were narrated by Publius Varrus, the next four my Merlyn himself.  The all-seeing, all-knowing author narrates \\"Uther\\", and I feel that this point of view offers a nice change of pace in the series and works well.  Although this book covers the same time period as a previous installment, the overlap of actual events is minimal.  In \\"The Eagle's Brood\\", Merlyn regards Uther as a pariah.  In \\"Uther\\", we are given the balancing story in which some of the major mysteries from earlier in the Chronicles are solved.  <br />Overall, the whole series is different from most in its handling of Uther.  In the original Mallory and all of the retellings I had read up to this one, the character of Uther is not a particularly well-developed one.  He appears as almost an incidental character who co-incidentally sired Arthur.  If he is given any ink, as in Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy, it is to describe him as a brusque, brutal, and lustful creature with no redeeming qualities other than his great physical strength and prowess as a warrior.  Mr. Whyte has made Uther into a man of high nobility, deserving of our respect, admiration, and sympathy.  And, this is only fitting if we are to consider that his son Arthur was renown for his nobility, personal strength, and sense of justice.  Although Arthur never knew Uther as an adult, we all grow up hearing that the fruit seldom falls far from the tree.    <br /> I have read dozens of retellings of the Arthurian saga, and am nowhere near having my fill.  I regard the Camulod Chronicles as one of the best.  I look forward to reading book 8 of the chronicles as soon as it is written.	2001-04-23

David Eddings' irreverent characters and their noble quest to save the world were truly fresh, interesting, and endearing when they first appeared in the \\"Belgariad\\".  They were still more entertaining than most of the genre in the \\"Malloreon\\".  They were still interesting in the two Sparhawk trilogies.  And, though it was a bittersweet parting, they had admirably run their course when the loose ends were tied up in \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" and \\"Polgara the Sorceress\\".   And \\"The Rivan Codex\\" was a great scholarly touch to close out one of the greatest fantasy series' of all time, and the Eddingses even warned us not to expect any more sequels.<br />So, why do I feel used and abused by the Eddingses after reading \\"The Redemption of Althalus\\"?  Because I fell for the hype.   I was truly expecting an original \\"epic\\" fantasy, one that measured up to the high standards set by the previously mentioned novels, yet breaking totally new ground.   Face it, an Althalus by any other name is still a  Belgarath/Silk/Sparhawk.  A Dweia by any other name is still a Polgara.  A Gher by any other name is still close enough to an Errand to beg the comparison.  <br />This book managed to remind us of the few weaknesses of the authors' previous works and accentuate them.  Let me list a few:<br />- I understand that stereotypes often have their basis in perception and are very effective as a vehicle of satire.  But, 700+ pages of going on about how all Arums are belligerent, money-grubbing, drunkards and all Plakands are rustics is too close to how all Thulls are thick-headed and all Tolnedrans are money-grubbers and all Drasnians are slick weasels.  In other words, enough!!!!<br />- At least Zedar had some class and showed some intelligence.  The bad guys in \\"Althalus\\" are all total idiots, waiting at every turn to be foiled by the heroes.<br />- One of the recurring themes through the first two thirds of the book is that war is reprehensible.  Yet, the descriptions of the battle scenes are totally sterile.  I realize that they don't have to be as intense as George R. R. Martin's tales to make their point, but casually mentioning that thousands of the enemy were killed in a three-word description of the battle do not make the point that was is heck.  What puts Mr. Martin's books head and shoulders above other contemporary fantasy is the emotion that they evoke.  War truly is HECK. . .   I am not a fan of totally gratuitous violence, but you need some hyperbole to make your point.  Hey, these writers have no compunction about slapping us silly with stale stereotypes, do they??<br />- The dialogue in this book crosses the fine line that the previous books skirted, but managed to artfully avoid.  The dialogue this time is truly patronizing, when it's not being totally trite.  It has elevated \\"cutesy\\" to an art form.   There are some attempts at \\"serious\\" dialogue, but they are so wooden and hollow that they echo.<br />- The plot is lame.  We are so constantly told that everything will work out, don't worry, that there is absolutely no suspense or tension.<br />- The time/place tripping magic is so contrived that it's laughable.  It's barely one step away from deus ex machina in that whenever a hero does get into a tight spot, someone thinks of a new way to pervert the \\"magic\\" to immediately get them out of it without breaking a sweat.<br />Some previous reviewers pointed out the \\"flaws\\" in earlier slams of this book by citing that it's steeped in Hindu theology with mythic subtexts and that those critics were not smart or worthy enough to take umbrage on this tripe.  Granted, there are some similarities in names, but this is not something that only the Eddingses have done.  Most contemporary fantasy is rooted in some classical mythology, yet makes its own original take.  I want a story I can enjoy, not clever reference to an obscure myth that three people may know.  Recreational reading should not be a test.  And, don't insult my intelligence by implying that my ignorance of or disinterest in ancient theology and mythology makes me \\"unworthy\\".<br />My overall feeling after reading this book is that I have played a game of Dungeons and Dragons with a too benevolent Dungeon Master.  The company was put into situations that could have been potentially dangerous, but they were given all the spells, devices, and whatnot they needed to counteract all potential misdeeds, and, if they couldn't figure out how to use them, where given broad hints by the gods.  As I said earlier, there was absolutely no suspense or tension.<br />All in all, I will still read books by the Eddingses.  I can only hope they read some of the feedback they're getting from far more eloquent reviewers than I and that they take it as a wakeup call for next time.  It's a tough crowd out there and you can only coast on reputation for a very short time.  The liner notes of earlier books stated the David Eddings turned to fantasy \\"in an effort to develop certain technical and philosophical ideas concerning that genre\\".  It's time he tried some new ideas because the ones he's still working at have been all mined out.	2001-04-18

Let me preface my remarks by saying that I consider Raymond Feist one of the greatest contemporary writers of the fantasy of intrigue, along with George R. R. Martin.  Mr. Feist's characters tend to possess a little more humor than Mr. Martin's, but that in no way detracts from the gravity and intensity of the stories.  I dedicated most of the fall of 2000 to reading all of Mr. Feist's \\"Riftwar\\" novels, including the \\"Empire\\" trilogy that he co-authored with Janny Wurts.  I thoroughly enjoyed every word I read and have recommended these books to at least a half dozen of my friends. . .  <br />So, why is this beginning to sound like a mea culpa??  Because, even though I enjoyed this book for what it is, an enjoyable yarn and a good read, I cannot call it one of Mr. Feist's best works.  The first two books of the \\"Riftwar Legacy\\", \\"Krondor: The Betrayal\\" and \\"Krondor: The Assassins\\", worked as two connected parts of the same whole.  \\"Krondor: Tear of the Gods\\" picks up on the same story line and introduces a new main character in the magician Jazhara, but instead of advancing the series and wrapping it up, as I had thought it was going to, it leaves us hanging for, guess what, another sequel.  The same hook that began this book remains at the end, with no resolution, just with more red herrings thrown in.  I realize that should not be a bad thing, but I'm beginning to fear, just a little bit, that Mr. Feist might just be teetering on the brink of becoming, gasp, Robert Jordan.  It almost seems that Mr. Feist has lost his direction in Midkemia and is afraid to let go of the world and the friends that he has created, and, who, up to this point have been faithful and endearing.  We have been to Midkemia during the time of the Riftwar in the original series.  We saw the alternative view of the Riftwar in the \\"Empire\\" series.  We have seen the aftermath of the Riftwar and saw the younger characters grow up in the stand-alone Riftwar novels, \\"Prince of the Blood\\" and \\"The King's Buccaneer\\".  We saw the final barriers to peace in a future Midkemia shattered as the ancestors of the Riftwar conquered all in the \\"Serpent War\\" saga.  A successful PC game, \\"Return to Krondor\\" was spawned by the Riftwar phenomenon.  Perhaps the weakness of this book can be explained by the fact that the novels of the Riftwar Legacy are patterned after a game.  Perhaps I should consider it remarkable that Mr. Feist has managed to squeeze three decent books out of a game and leave it at that.  After all, every other attempt at turning a game into literature has been wretched.  <br />Raymond Feist is a major talent and will remain one of my favorite writers.  I am confident that a man of his talents can step out of these temporary doldrums and produce more masterpieces of fantasy.  I truly hope that the next installment of the Riftwar Legacy is indeed one of those masterpieces and it will manage to shut up a fool like me!!!	2001-03-29

Although this is ostensibly a review of \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\", it in actuality covers all six books of the series to date (\\"The Skystone\\", \\"The Singing Sword\\", \\"The Eagles' Brood\\",  \\"The Saxon Shore\\", \\"The Fort at River's Bend\\", and \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\"), primarily focusing on the last two.   This series, The Camulod Chronicles, outlines the story of King Arthur as it might have been in a historical perspective, beginning with the end of the Roman occupation of Britain.  If there were such a person as Arthur, he would have lived during this time.  Most likely, he was a composite character, based on some of the more influential warlords and petty kings of the day.  As an aside, I am reminded of a vacation in  southern England that my family took in 1995.  My sons, who were 11 and 13 at the time, could not understand my excitement in viewing the ruins of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, asking \\"How can this be the birthplace of someone who never was?\\"  But, that's a different story. . .<br />The first two books of the series, which outlined the founding of Camulod (or Camelot) and Avalon and the forging of the sword Excalibur, were told from the viewpoint of an old Roman soldier.  The last two books, which detail the birth of Arthur and his early boyhood years, are told from the viewpoint of Merlin, or, \\"Merlyn\\" in the Chronicles.  The last two books, which detail Arthur's adolescence and subsequent coronation as High King of Britain, are also told from Merlyn's point of view.  As an avid reader of Arthurian legend and all its various retellings, let me tell you that the character of Merlin is probably one of the most varied of them all, probably due to the fact that he was actually a minor character in Mallory.  Hence, the details are free to be filled in by the current chronicler.  Merlin ranges from an evil wizard living backward in time to a benevolent sorcerer to merely a human being who is just a little smarter than most.  The most esoteric versionof Merlin can be found in Stephen Lawhead's Pendragon  Cycle in which Merlin is the son of Charis, the last princess of Atlantis, and Taliesen, the greatest of the Celtic Bards.  Except for the exotic birth, Jack Whyte's Merlyn has much in common with Lawhead's Merlin in that both were mortal men, though a little larger than life in that they were fierce warriors, outstanding field generals, and outstanding scholars.  Also, neither possessed the true gift of magic, though they were believed to by the masses of humanity.  In the sixth book, we are also given a glimpse into Merlyn's future as he begins to withdraw from the public eye, just as Arthur begins his ascendancy into it.<br />The Camulod Chronicles begin earlier than Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\", in a time that historically did occur, hence the tales carry an air of realism.  The descriptions of the Roman influence on Britain in the late Fourth and early Fifth centuries are fascinating.  The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, but the pages just keep on turning.  The story is easy to follow as well as fun.  There are those critics who complain that some of the dates given are inaccurate, as well as some of the situations.  As Don Henley sang, \\"Get over it.\\"  This is historical fiction at it's finest, with the emphasis on fiction.  Granted, there are differences between this series and others of its kind, but the abundant variety of viewpoints and details are what make Arthurian literature the great store that it is.  For the most part, the common characters that the Camulod Chronicles share with other retellings are true to form, though the treatment of Vortigern is more sympathetic than any other I can recall.<br />As I type this, I am awaiting the arrival of the seventh book of the series, \\"Uther\\".  I will keep reading these books as long as Mr. Whyte keeps writing them.  So far, I consider this to be among the best Arthurian series' I have ever read.  I would recommend them to anyone who has an interest inthe Arthurian legend, anyone who has an interest in historical fiction, or both.  As a bonus, anyone who likes these books would most likely like Stephen Lawhaead's Pendragon Cycle and Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy.  The order you read them in is not important, though somewhere in the mix you should read Mallory to see where it all began.  I love Arthurian fiction and fact, and, after reading these books, I'm sure a lot of the rest of you will, too.	2001-03-29

Granted, there are differences between this series and others of its kind, but the abundant variety of viewpoints and details are what make Arthurian literature the great store that it is.  The only \\"disconcerting\\" thing I've found so far is that the character of Vortigern (who was an actual person, by the way) is far more sympathetic in these tales than in others I've read.  But, then, Jack Whyte has turned out such a magnum opus that I can only admire and respect his poetic license.<br />I have begun the fifth book of the series, \\"The Fort at River's Bend\\" and the level has not dropped.  I will keep reading these books as long as Mr. Whyte keeps writing them  (book 6 is in print and book 7 is due to be published later this year).

Let me make two points before I begin my review in earnest.  First, I really wanted to give this story 4.5 stars for reasons I'll get to later.   Second, I'm really considering the first two books of the Camulod Chronicles, \\"The Skystone\\" and \\"The Singing Sword\\" in this review.  One segues nicely into the other, and book three, \\"The Eagles' Brood\\" begins a shift in point of view, but I won't go into detail or give away any secrets to those of you who have not yet begun the series.<br />This is historical fiction at its finest.  The Chronicles begin late in the time of the Roman occupation of Britain and provide the \\"historical\\" basis of the life and times of King Arthur.  The first two books, \\"The Skystone\\" and \\"The Singing Sword\\", bring us to the beginning of the withdrawal of Roman troops from Britain, of the beginning of the end of the Pax Romanna, or the \\"Roman peace\\" imposed upon Britain by the Roman occupation.  And, from a historical perspective, \\"peace\\" was an odd term to describe the times as they were riddled by invasions by the Saxons from the mainland and the Scots from Ireland, as well as breaches of the northern border by the Picts from Scotland.  In fact, it is during these raids that the protagonists of these tales, Caius Britannicus and Publius Varrus, achieve their fame and rank.  These two gentlemen are literary creations, but the situations they are put in and some of the principal people with who they consort were real enough.  After retiring from active service, they established a co-operative colony in west Britain as a safe haven from what Britannicus perceives as the impending end of the world as they know it.  The descriptions of day-to-day life in the colony and in Britain of the day are no doubt historically accurate and fascinating from that standpoint alone.<br />Britannicus is the brains of the operation, but it is Varrus' memoirs we are reading.  Varrus turns out to be one of the strongest voices of contemporary Arthurian fiction andis a truly remarkable character.  He was a warrior beyond compare and saved Britannicus on more than one occasion.  Britannicus is the noble Roman to the core and his influence on the story line and the founding of the colony is unmistakable, but Varrus is the flesh and blood that makes the story work.  As in all good stories, he is a hero with the occasional feet of clay.  He makes some bad decisions that come back to haunt him and his for several generations.  He sometimes does things he regrets later.  But, he is truly convincing as narrator and always elicits his readers ear and sympathy.  As an avid reader of the Arthurian legend, I have a pretty good idea where this series will have gone by the end of the sixth book, but I also know that I will enjoy the ride.  (Potential spoiler follows:)  So far we have been introduced to the establishment of Camelot, the Lady of the Lake, and the sword Excalibur.  <br />As for why only 4 (or 4.5) stars instead of 5. . .  I am comparing this series to others I have read in the genre.  While it is better than most, it's not quite up to (at least not yet) the two that I consider top-shelf - Stephen Lawhead's \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" and Mary Stewart's \\"Merlin Trilogy\\".  The \\"Camulod Chronicles\\" has points in common with both of these, Lawhead's for the predominance of the Christian influence on the people of the day and Stewart's for the inclusion of Merlin's point of view.  By the end of book 6, I might be giving Jack Whyte 5 stars on his own merit - I think these books can be that good.  (Another potential spoiler:) I must add that I'm cheating here - book 3, \\"The Eagle's Brood\\", starts out from Merlin's narrative - I'm assuming that this will remain the case for a while.<br />In summary, this is a good tale so far.  I would recommend it highly to any closet Arthurian scholars out there (I consider myself one), anyone who has any interest in the Arthurian legend, or just anyone who has a hankering for historical fiction.	2001-02-19

Secondly, I am a 50-year old child of the 60's and am sick and tired of the attempts of Congress and sundry talk show hosts who have been trying to repeal the 60's ever since the ascendance of  Bill Clinton to the Presidency.  I shudder to think of what may happen in the next four years, but that's for a different time. . .<br />I thank Mr. King for writing this collection of five interlocked stories.  As an earlier reviewer remarked, your reaction to these stories will be tempered by your age.  That observation is dead on.  Having lived through the time period the tales cover, I was profoundly affected by each one.  Mr. King beautifully captured a process that each of us who came of age during the 60's and the subsequent end of the Vietnam War went through.  Whether you were for the war or against it, you spent a lot of time thinking about it, and for many people, a lot of time acting on it.  My own active service was limited to four months Army basic training in 1972.   Although I was against the war, my activism was limited.  (My college roommate, Jim, described he and I as \\"apathetic left-wingers\\", an interesting oxymoron.)  Mr. King captured my role perfectly in the character Nate Hoppenstand, Pete the protagonist's own roommate in the \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" novella in the collection.  Like me, Nate had strong passions and ideals, but not enough to push us from the periphery into the forefront of radical organizations and active demonstrations.  After all, a body could get hurt, or worse, arrested, and how to you explain that to Mom and Dad back home?  I don't know a lot about Mr. King's own life, but I have to believe that much of this book is autobiographical; the characters are too real for it not to be.  He captured the spirit and the personalities of the time to a \\"T\\".  Anyone who grew up during this period knows someone that fits the description of each person in the stories.  (Except, perhaps, for Ted Brautigan, I suppose.)  Paul Simon in \\"Bookends\\" sang of the 60's as a time of innocence, and he was right.  But it was also a time of turmoil, a time of love, and a time of social and moral upheaval.  In other words, it was a time of contradictions.  The Doors, Steve and Edye, Jimi Hendrix, Nancy Sinatra, and Sonny and Cher were all on the Billboard Top 40 at the same time - and it was perfectly acceptable to like them all.  Gen X'ers, say what you will, but the 60's were the most passionate time to be alive in my lifetime and a great era to be rooted in.    <br />As I said, the stories are inter-related, but each is strong in it's own right, and each is moving.  The writing is tight, and the time just flies by.  After 672 pages, I was not ready for the book to end.  <br />I suppose there are some weaknesses - you really never know why Bobby's mother was the way she was, and maybe you had to read the Dark Towers novels to fully understand some of the references.  But these are minor points and in no way detract from the overall impact and enjoyment of the stories.  This is contemporary writing at its finest.   <br />I may read more of Stephen King or I may not.  In either case, I'm sure glad I read this one.	2001-02-04

I have just finished reading this book, the third in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\", and will most likely be waiting on edge for book four like a junkie waiting for a fix.  If it doesn't come out this year, I fear I may not last. . .<br /> Fortunately, there will other pick-me-ups along the way, like the conclusion of Raymond Feist's \\"Riftwar Legacy\\" series, and other books that I haven't gotten to yet, but \\"Dance with Dragons\\" is the one I will be truly waiting for.  Have I mentioned that I really, really like this series yet?  George R. R. Martin has created a world that rivals Middle Earth, Arrakis (aka Dune), the world of Thomas Covenant, the world of the Riftwar, and the world of the Wheel of Time for detail, richness, and complexity.  And, he really does something with it.  He populates it with incredible characters with deep personalities, throws in plot twists worthy of Machiavelli, and stretches your own sense of right and wrong with ethical dilemmas right out of ecclesiastical philosophy.<br />Although the saga is cloaked in medieval fantasy, it is not a story of sword and sorcery.  This is first and foremost a work of ideas and ethics.  Political intrigue enters the equation, but the true treasures in these books are the characters.  They are everyday people thrown into situations that test their strength, both physical and spiritual.  The feudal framework forms the perfect foil as brother is pitted against brother, father against son, husband against wife, and sister against brother.  In the name of honor, family, and justice, these people are asked to make judgments that require the wisdom of Solomon and the strength of Hercules.  And, since this is not brought to us by Disney studios, they don't always make the \\"right\\" choices.  The \\"heroes\\" sometimes do the \\"wrong\\" thing; the \\"villains\\" sometimes perform acts of outright nobility.  The only thing that is predictable is that the story is not formulaic and predictable.<br />As the series progresses, the presence of magic increases, but it is not benign magic - every visible aspect is dark.  Characters who appear to be the most upstanding are killed off by treachery; sometimes the treacherous get theirs and sometimes they don't.  Every chapter ends with a mini-cliffhanger and sometimes what you assume happened, didn't.  As the sword master told Arya in the first book, you must see with your eyes, not with your mind.  I think I have finally figured out where the story is going, but I won't divulge my thoughts for two reasons.  One, I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not read this book yet, and, two, if I'm wrong, I don't want to let on to you all how stupid I am. . .  <br />This series is intense, as anyone who's made it this far knows.  It most likely isn't for everyone.  But if you haven't started book one yet, give it a try.  If you get through the third book, I guarantee you will be affected, as well as hooked.  You will find yourself looking at moral and ethical situations with different eyes; you will not be as judgmental as you were before.  You will learn things about yourself as well as enjoy one mighty fine read.  I know.  I went into this series cold, and I'm a convert.  Please, Mr. Martin, please finish book four tonight!!	2001-01-31

I loved &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; so much, I was almost afraid to read &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; because of the dread of &quot;sequal shock&quot;.  Fortunately, George R. R. Martin is definitely not a one-trick pony.  This series continues to deliver.<br />With the advent of war, the pace of action picks up, which should satisfy the faction of reviewers that feels &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; did not have enough action.  There is a little more magic for those who felt the predecessor novel lacked enough conspicuous &quot;gee whiz&quot; magic.  The magic is still scarce, which decidedly adds to its power.  As a fantasy novel, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; maintains the stature of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; in standing head and sholders above most of comtemporary fantasy and sci-fi.  In my book, Mr. Martin stands with Raymond Feist, Stephen Lawhead, and Gene Wolfe as a cut above the others.  (Not to deny that that are other authors who come close - these are the ones I really like.) <br />I will grant that there is not as much continuous action as one might find in, say, Terry Goodkind, or some of the slash-and-burn sword-and-sorcery series', but that is in no way a mark of weakness.  The &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is first and foremost a saga of people and ideas.  The intrigue and interplay is makes this series.  The facts that the writing is top-notch and that the story is riveting (at least to me) are the icing on the cake.  The development of the characters continues from the first book, and I find myself even more interested in them.  The passing of certain of the characters actually brought tears to my eyes.  (I should add that I am a 50-year old Italian male.)  The fact that certain of the characters who desparately deserve to be knocked down a peg or two (I'm not bloodthirsty enough to demand their death) continue to live adds to the realism.  In that, this tale mirrors contemporary life.  That is it's ultimate charm - we are not constantly reminded that the characters are superhuman; we are reminded that they are all too human.  They make errors in judgement, they bleed, they cry, they laugh, they are occassionally heroic - you get the picture.        <br />The only &quot;weakness&quot;, and I use the term loosely, that might be perceived is that each book is definitely a piece of a continuing, larger whole.  There are no momentary resolutions of plot at the end of the book.  These cannot be perceived as stand-alone installments.  Having said that, I still prefer these books over many far more lame series' that do wrap up each book nicely, leaving only the overall cliff-hanger, such as how are the heros ultimately going to save the world in book 3?  (Or book 5, or book 9, or book 10, or book ???)  <br />After two books of &quot;The Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, I'm actually glad to say that I don't know with certainty where it's going.  Maybe ultimate good will triumph over ultimate evil.  Maybe not.  At this point, the thrill is in the journey and I'm not planning to get off!	2001-01-20

I had had it lying around the house for several years, but had not been motivated to pick it up and read it.  Then, many of the slams of  \\"Winter's Heart\\" suggested that we read George R. R. Martin to see some good writing.  I figured that that many readers can't be wrong, and I was right!  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the best fantasy of intrigue that I have read since Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts' \\"Empire\\" trilogy, if not ever.<br />The fact that the book is somewhat patterned on the War of the Roses does not detract from the richness of the world Mr. Martin has created.  And this world is not defined by drawn-out, detailed descriptions and charts, but by the clarity of the prose.  In fact, the genealogies and characteristics of the great houses are spelled out so well in the story that the appendix at the end is almost superfluous.<br />The characters are terrific.  Although some are \\"better\\" than others, no one is truly \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\".  Instead, we are presented with a cast of normal individuals in extraordinary times.  How they interact, react, grow, and/or regress comprises the bulk of the action.<br />Having said that, I must also say that this is a novel of ideas and personalities.  It is not \\"slash and burn\\" fantasy, but its use of magical arts is mostly insinuated and any actual acts or situations are limited to what is necessary to advance Mr. Martin's ideas.  Some previous reviewers have complained about the scarcity of magic.  I beg to differ, as the rarity of magic adds to its power in those instances that it appears.  All is in context; there are no gratuitous displays of grandiose \\"swords and sorcery\\" to attempt to revive a plot gone stale or just for their own sake.<br />This is a tale of people.  They fight, they grow, they plot, they scheme, they are noble, they are despicable, they struggle, they triumph over long odds, they fail, they die, but they always entertain.  In other words, they are like people that we all know, wish we knew, or wish we didn't know.  It's tempting to say that the \\"villains\\" are too evil until we remember that history is full of people like the Borgias, Rasputin, and Machiavelli.<br />In closing, I feel obligated to add a slight disclaimer - parts of the story evoke intense emotion, there are \\"adult\\" situations and behavior, and people you grow to like will die, and will die far to early.  But those are the things that make this book soar above most of the others in the genre.  I have already begun reading the second book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\", will follow that with \\"A Storm of Swords\\", and will anxiously await book 4!!t they always entertain.

As a fan of the &quot;South Florida crazy&quot; genre, as typified by Carl Hiaasen, I looked forward to reading this book.  Sad to say, though the story did turn out to be mildly entertaining, I was overall disappointed.  The book was strictly a Hiaasen knock-off, and suffered from a serious sense of dislocation.  <br />What Mr. Dorsey tried to do is relocate the action from the Miami area to the west coast of Florida, an area that he is most familiar with as a former columnist with the Tampa Tribune.  But, to anyone familiar with the demographics of Florida, the translation does not work.  East Florida is just naturally zanier than West Florida!!  (And I say this as a long time resident of West Florida.  It is neither good nor bad, just a statement of fact.)  The result was a storyline that was contrived.  The heroes, or &quot;good guys&quot; were well defined and are truly likeable guys, but the villians were stock characters from Hiaasen (though a little less grotesque) and the situations forced.   <br />The only person who can attempt to mimic Carl Hiaasen is Dave Barry, as he did in Big Trouble.  He can get away with it because, after all, he is Dave Barry!  <br />I'm not sorry I read this book, and will read the follow-up, Hammerhead Hotel, though I will wait for it in paperback.	2001-01-06

This is the fourth Sister Fidelma book I have read, and have yet to be disappointed!  Though I am not a particularly big mystery fan, I am a fan of Celtic/Irish myth and legend.  As Peter Tremayne, under his real name (maybe) of Peter Beresford Ellis, is a well-known authority on the ancient Celts, the stories carry an air of realism to the point that I feel I'm there when I read them, even to the extreme of feeling chilly when he describes the winters in Ireland of yore.  As I live in south Florida, this is no mean feat! <br />Along with Ellis Peters in the Brother Cadfael series, Mr. Tremayne has a lock on the medieval sleuth genre.  As with Ms. Peters, Mr. Tremayne adds just the right touch of reference to actual historical personages to give proper perspective, as well as to give them credibility.  The twists of intrigue are historically accurate, as well as interesting and entertaining.  And what the good sister can make of clues without the aid of a full 20th century forensics lab is asounding!<br />The characterizations are the work of a writer who truly understands the human condition.  Sister Fidelma is not perfect, nor does she pretend to be.  But she, and the other recurring characters, grow with the series.  I cannot begin to describe the plot, as it takes so many twists and turns, but it unravels neatly, if you're of a mind to try to figure out who-dun-it before the good Sister does it for us.<br />As each book of the series builds on the previous ones, I would recommend that new readers begin with the first of the series, &quot;Absolution by Murder&quot;.  Each book is worthy of respect, though I must say that &quot;The Subtle Serpent&quot; is my favorite so far.  I would recommend these books to anyone who loves mysteries, Irish history, both of the above, or just a good read!!	2000-12-30

I can only hope that Robert Jordan is still having fun writing this tripe because it stopped being fun to read about 4 or 5 books ago.  Say what you will about it being set in a complex world that requires time to develop and &quot;adults&quot; to understand it as much as you want, but, in the end, it is a world and a series that has become bloated beyond both belief and necessity.  My biggest gripe, however, is the total abruptness with which we are re-immersed into the story line, after a two year wait since the last book.  With no preamble or synopsis, we are practically dropped into the middle of conversations.  Since many of the names are similar, since events take thousands of pages across several books to come to a resolution, and since there are myriads of varied suplots, Mr. Jordan could at least make life easier on his readers by dropping reminders, at least in the earlier pages of the book, like &quot;Perrin, who was raised by wolves, set out after the Aiel who kidnapped his wife, Faile at gunpoint and spirited her to the lost city of St. Louis in the borderlands.&quot;  As it is, we are expected to remember the details of the kidnapping, who all was with Faile, who among those are pretending to be someone else, and why we should care.  And we are expected to divine all this from converstions that began in a book we read two years ago.<br />And the cast of characters grows only more despicable and unlikable with each  book.  They show absolutely no development, only more regression into the spoiled children they started as.  Unfortunately, far more words are invested in what they are wearing instead of how they are growing.  Maybe it would be more palatable if they at least developed new habits instead of constantly yanking at their braids and smoothing their clothing.<br />I realize that many genre writes don't like to read in their own genre for fear of &quot;stealing&quot; other writers' ideas.  But Mr. Jordan would well be served by taking some hints from some ot the current masters of fantasy.  David and Leigh Eddings tend to be a tad wordy at times, but their characters are about the finest in contemporary fantasy.  They don't get in a snit if someone has the audacity of trying to save their bacon like all of the arrogant Aes Sedai and stout Two Rivers folk on the Wheel of Time.  As for plot development, Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts, in the various Riftwar and Empire series', have more action and plot twists in one chapter than the most of the Wheel of Time books have in 700 pages.  And the characters actually learn from their previous actions, to boot!<br />In summary, I can only surmise that the Wheel of Time series is meant for those readers who are willing to invest all of their reading time to one writer, and are willing to restart from book one each time a new one appears.  As far as I can tell, that's the only way to keep everything staight in your mind.  James Joyce felt that his readers should be willing to invest as much time in reading his books as he did writing them.  Well, I always thought that was an incredible presumption, and Robert Jordan is no James Joyce.  The sad thing is that I have invested too much time in this series to stop reading it now, but I regard it as a chore, not a pleasure.  If anyone reading this review has not yeat started reading the series, DON'T!!  Trust me, you'll thank me some day.from some ot the current masters of fantasy.

US	52520983	R2NGXU42DJCF1Y	0812551761	830797456	King & Raven	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Raven is now my favorite character in Arthurian literature.	As an avid reader of all the retellings of the Arthurian legend, as well as the tracts that attempt to place it in historical perspective, I am always thrilled to find a unique version.  And I have to put &quot;King  &amp; Raven&quot; in that category.  It managed to remain &quot;true&quot;  to the mainline version of the tale, yet the introduction of the peasant  perspective gave it a realism I had not yet seen.  The shabby treatment of  the common people of the day was not something I had ever considered  before, but I can only feel it was accurate.  As a result, Raven, the  accidental knight, has become the first character of the legend that I can  truly say I would have wanted to be.  He truly embodied the spirit of  chivalry that the &quot;true&quot; knights could never achieve because of  their petty vanities and self-indulgence. As I came to the final pages of  the book, I realized I wasn't ready for it to end!  In Cornish folklore,  Arthur's soul  went into a raven's body upon his death.  I can only hope  that Mr. James is planning on tying this tidbit into a sequel!	1998-11-26
