You bet! Is &quot;Staiway to Heaven&quot; their best biography? It comes damn close! As far as factoids and beautiful glossies, this book has it's bases covered. However in terms of looks, it could definetly use an overhaul. The cover is a bit garish and  not at all fitting to the title, which is a bit jarring, but nothing to  weep about. The insight it gives into the lives of Plant, Page and the rest  of the &quot;lads&quot; is extremely interesting, whether you're a fan or  not.

After I delved into it, I was pleasantly suprised. I though to myself, here was a book written in a slightly arciac style chronicling the  adolesence of a nearly forgotten writer that I could still relate to. I  suspect the only reason I found it interesting at all was because I like  the character in the story was still a young man myself. The way Joyce  anaylsizes the times he lives in, and gives philsophical insight, is trully  inspiring. I recommend this book to anyone who Irish or not, seek a clearer  understanding or themselves, and a glimpse into a now forgotten realm of  youth and mystery.	2000-05-02

Still this was a good  book to help fill my Bradbury collection. And so, here's my recommendation  to Mr and Mrs. John Q.
