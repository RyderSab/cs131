Books	5	4	4	N	N	history and lore of a noted Georgia island	Nine miles long and two miles wide, \\"Jekyll's island is the smallest of Georgia's Golden Isles.\\" A teacher at Middle Tennessee State U., in this third book of her's on Georgia's Jekyll's Island, McCash gives a panoramic view of its history from its original Native American inhabitants through effects on the Island from events in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars up to when it was made into a club in 1886 for many of the wealthiest individuals in the country. This club was the prototype for later exclusive spots on other islands along the coast of Southeastern states for wealthy and well-known individuals from all walks of life. McCash follows the centuries-long history largely through the positions and activities of individuals of the different periods with respect to the Island. Among these are English colonists, settlers, soldiers, slaves and slave-owners, and men who sought to restore the Island from the neglect it had fallen into after the Civil War. McCash's work of regional history offers an extended background on the one small island in this area which has attracted national attention for its popularity with politicians, celebrities, and wealthy businesspersons.	2005-09-27

Eigenbrod's work is not about ancient Native American folk tales, myths, etc., but about coming to proper--literarily, culturally, and ethically proper--understandings of modern and contemporary First Nations literature as much as this is possible by outsiders. A primary, though not dominating strand of the work of literary analysis and cultural understanding is the author's biographical story of how she came to the positioning (method or structure are too strong) she expounds as a German-Canadian. The proper understanding of Native American literature she develops and commends depends partly on comprehending one's own ethnicity, heritage, position in society, and personality. Eigenbrod is a teacher of Aboriginal Literature at the U. of Manitoba.	2005-09-27

The crucial challenge of finding and developing talented actors is not overlooked either. Success for such a community production is measured by standards of artistic performance, community service, and management responsibility. Historical dramas are particularly appealing to community theater groups because of the wide freedom they allow in dealing with different historical times, the range of important and often colorful characters, and recurring issues in human affairs. Historical plays can also have a high education value for a local population when local historical characters, scenes, and topics are portrayed. All dimensions of this type of drama particularly suited to community theaters are dealt with, from developing an idea and perspective, writing a script, staging, and engaging with the larger community. This second edition is an abridged revision of the first edition put out in 1965.	2005-09-27

Yet of course you can't. You're not a poet with Skinner's unique gift of plain language artfully used to articulate the common life. This is not revelation, but rather memory. Skinner continually brings to mind--brings back to mind--moments everyone has experienced physically or in thought, but has not had the time or made the effort to reflect much on. Thus, there is in these poems a sense of familiarity; which is one thing that leads one to wrongly believe one could write the same words Skinner does. Skinner leads one to familiarity with aspects of one's life, often aspects one has missed, sometimes neglected. Skinner is a seasoned, widely-published poet whose work has appeared in Poetry, Yale Review, Slate, Paris Review, and elsewhere.	2005-09-27

Practically speaking, Malay literature as a distinct literary tradition is no more, having been effaced by the social and cultural forces of the modern world. Besides, the Malay culture of Southeast Asia never had the vast population and large geographical reach of the dominant regional powers of China and India. Yet Malay literature managed to exert an outsized, though limited, influence on the incomparably more widespread, lasting regional literatures for its richness from the way it \\"fused, adapted, transfigured, and indiginized\\" the varied influences it came into contact with as well as for the complex forms it worked over the course of its periods defined by Braginsky. One wishes for more samplings of Malay writings. But more would have made a large and dauntingly complete and learned book with an 80-page bibliography larger, though perhaps less daunting. No matter--ones solidly motivated to learn about Malay literature will gain from the work what they need to know for a full appreciation of its historical background, subjects, and forms, and for Western readers, its exoticism.	2005-09-27

Severance (assistant professor, Auburn U.) refers to this state militia as \\"radical\\" because it was used by Brownlow and others who \\"styled themselves radical Republicans.\\" These \\"radicals,\\" however, were the duly elected, legitimate political leaders of Tennessee at the time. The determined resistance they met from many Tennesseans, however, including the Ku Klux Klan, made the Northern victory in the Civil War seem \\"the most gigantic falsehood of the age,\\" as one Radical Republican put it. The State Guard's role has been controversial since Reconstruction. But Severance views it mostly favorably, while not leaving out the controversial aspects of its role. It filled a role between local authorities who were part of the resistance or helpless to curtail it and the Federal authorities and troops who regarded it as outside their jurisdiction. Without the State Guard, Tennessee would have been mostly lawless. Severence studies its necessary, irreplaceable role in laying the political and legal groundwork, however controversial and flawed this was, which the victorious Union side had fought for in the Civil War. This thankless task fell to the Guard, which met it effectively and respectably.	2005-09-27

The Americans knew that they had support among some of the French-Canadian \\"habitants\\" (i. e., peasants). Though this support turned out not to be widespread or effective enough to help the Americans to victory, Carleton wanted to weed the supporters out of the local militias. In their journal, Baby and the others reported parish by parish the actions they took against individuals posing a threat to British control of Canada and the reasons for this. Some militia men performed military duties such as standing guard for the invading rebel forces; others encouraged support for them; and others offered them food or transpiration. Carleton's punitive measures were mild, dismissal from the militia in most cases; but they were effective in virtually eliminating what support there was for the Americans among the French-Canadian peasants. The journal is an important historical document first published in the 1920s.	2005-09-27

Except in Chernozemsky's \\"Phase One After Zero,\\" the attack on the World Trade Towers is aborted even as the terrorist plot is unfolding with the planes already in the air. Greg MacPherson struggles with Abu Atta, the terrorist ringleader, on the roof of one of the Trade Towers as CIA and FBI officials work desperately to bring into action the countermeasures to prevent the varied attacks. <br />      MacPherson is modeled psychologically on Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber; except that he has a change of heart as the deadly plot is nearing its culmination. Chernozemsky is interested in exploring \\"parallel dimensions\\" whose possibility reveals the alternate paths of history and the related different situations for individuals and Humankind. \\"What we think of our life on planet Earth, the people and the places, could be just reflections in parallel mirrors, where history changes, takes different paths, or maybe is simply postponed and eventually arrives at the same outcome because the course of history may be irrevocable.\\" <br />     MacPherson leaves the U. S. by going to Canada on his way to meet with the leaders of Al-Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden, in the Middle East. As MacPherson is brought into the terrorist circle and he and other plotters return to the U. S. to lay the groundwork for their sensational terrorist acts, the reader is exposed to the demented, yet rigorously rationalistic mind of the terrorists and their ruses to evade detection. <br />     As he has done in many of his previous novels, Chernozemsky uses this premise of a parallel dimension and narrative of how it might be played out to good effect. In terms of a compelling dramatic line, the author also sheds light on his larger themes of the complexities and related unpredictabilities of human nature and the coincidences which make for history affecting the lives of millions of persons and the fate of nations. Chernozemsky has used this technique previously in novels based on World War II and the ethnic strife in the Balkans. Readers of imaginative popular literature with distinctive characters, absorbing intrigue, and riveting action will find this book rewarding.	2005-09-20

This bountiful catalog demonstrates why Czech glass has in the relatively short time since the 1970s when it became widely known throughout Europe and other Western countries one of the most sought-after types of art glass. But the catalog is only the beginning of the varied, extensive content of this coffee-table size work of value to those with a specialized, well-developed interest in the field of glass. Eight introductory essays by experts cover Czech glass from its artistic and historical origins through its worldwide recognition largely from a 1959 exhibition in Moscow and designs for glass works kept at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York. Back matter (appendices) include bibliographical annotations of the glass artists; which besides their photographs, includes awards, exhibitions, and references in printed works. The back section after this has facsimiles of all of the artists' signatures. There are also informative sections supplementing the essays preceding the catalog. From aesthetic appreciation of the glass to information on the artists and the industry to crucial technical material such as signatures and more, \\"Czech Glass\\" contains everything anyone could be looking for on this subject.	2005-09-07

Yet his maritime paintings are more than plain realism, though they arise out of it. By angles of wave-tossed ships, contrasts of white splashes of spray and darker sea depths, near and distant objects, sails caught by wind to make different shapes, the casually strewn, but ready gear, and the rugged garments and practiced movements of the seamen and their calm, but focused expressions, Hoyne conveys the different facets of the natural element of the sea and the labors of sailors and fishermen who have grown so accustomed to these that they seem natural parts of the sea. The introductory text includes the bases of the authors' appreciation of Hoyne (basically because they saw in his paintings a realism with soul) and also the better part of a talk the artist gave at the Mystic Seaport Museum in 1983. Hoyne died in 1989, having devoted the last years of his life after being diagnosed with cancer in 1972 and given only two years to live to capturing the time--now mostly gone--when men in wooden sailing ships made their livings fishing in the Grand Banks of the North Atlantic. Full-page pictures of paintings take up most of the pages. But with these, as well as a number of smaller ones with the introductory text, are annotations or essay-like commentaries on the particular painting which often include references to aspects of this passing traditional work. Though not yet widely known, Hoyne is recognized immediately as in the top tier of modern-time maritime painters. This art book is proof of this, and will stir others to be keeping their eye out for paintings of his.	2005-09-07

The format of all of the sections from Munch's journals edited by the poet and literary critic Holland are broken into lines as if the content was entirely poems. But it is not. Munch's varied entries are perceptive on local events and persons of the day, his relationships with others, self-examination and self-discovery, and psychological insights. \\"The nervous talk a lot. Craziness often expresses itself in incessant talking. Talking has become...a sort of defense against other people...When I am talking I tax anyone I am with, as if I've taken him prisoner,\\" he writes in the entry titled \\"On Talking.\\" A friend of the famous writers Ibsen and Knut Hamsen, Munch appreciated the power of words and the skill of writers. He obviously took care to write as precisely and truly as he could, even for his \\"private journals\\"; here published more extensively than ever with a faithful, empathetic translation and concise introduction. With these journals, one sees behind the revolutionary paintings to the mind of the extraordinary painter who could make them.	2005-09-07

Rather, the title means more something like the \\"lord of the land.\\" For without the enveloping, expansive skies of the sharply-focused photographs, the persons, activities, buildings, and other parts of the scenes would not be. Despite the sharpness of the variously simple or multi-part foregrounds, the viewer's eye is drawn to the sky of each photograph. The sky dwarfs even mountain ranges in the background. The titles of the photographs are scientific names for the clouds in the skies; Cirrus fibratus, Cumulus mediocris, etc. The scientific preciseness of the photograph's titles and their clarity suggests no interpretation of them, no particular way of seeing them. It is by one's eye searching through them--attracted by the details which stand out, the cloud formations, and the endlessness of the sky--that one comes to an awareness of the \\"atmospheres\\" enveloping and pervading human life on earth. This is the first collection of Nonino's photography; which has been shown in solo and group exhibitions mostly in Italy and is a part of collections in Italy and France.	2005-09-07

This first was a book-like project with several leaves completed in 1969. Coming after this were sculpture-like, installation-like works (before this form was widely practiced) using the earthy materials of lead, brick, metal, wood, cloth, and often cast-off materials, as used in \\"found\\" art, though with not nearly the effect. Born in 1945, Kiefer could never free himself from the oppressiveness of the German psychoses and atrocities of the Nazi years, especially being a Jew. \\"[Kiefer] does not assume the existence of a paradise, only the ancient need to imagine one.\\" One sees in the artist's dense, bewitching works usually made of assorted materials this primitive longing for paradise impacted by the carnage and horrors of 20th century's crazed politics and warfare on a huge scale. The touches of brightness in many of Kiefer's works are sometimes overwhelmed by bricks and other materials the color of cinders, ashes, an unmistakable reference to the Holocaust and the \\"scorched earth\\" warfare waged by the German war machine. It is the natural materials of the art works such as leaves, ground, and cotton spun into clothing, not religious visions of Heaven, which offer any hope of transformative redemption and immortality there may be. As noted in the \\"Introduction,\\" Kiefer regarded the earth as a \\"kind of alchemical fragment\\" still being forged. \\"In Kiefer's cosmology, the universe is an immense athanor, or alchemical oven, where spirit and matter are in continued process of creation and destruction.\\" The book succeeds estimably as a retrospective on the span of Kiefer's career. Varying perspectives from distant to close-up on the art works enable one to grasp the complex historical, cultural, and mythical thoughts reflected in the composite, multilayered works and also the undying struggle between hope and memory embodied in them.	2005-09-07

It has come to her as traditional immigrant groups and newly arrived ones, and the myriad activities and behaviors of the huge population of a vibrant and crowded city. \\"Broadway Music\\" goes in part, \\"And the old men sing with her/they dream through the curving wood and metal/and the forms of the sounds that go out/as if the dirty newspapers and today's news/the people running up subway stairs/the dogs the pimps the hustlers....\\" This calls to mind Lorca's vision of New York, the eye of a newcomer.

Mugabe was one of the leaders of the insurrection and political leader of Zimbabwe (as the country was named after the end of white rule). To a large extent, this is the story of the murky circumstances whereby Mugabe became leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), including the assassination of its leader, and its role in helping to keep him in power. Instead of a bona fide political party in a democratic system, ZANU became the enforcement arm of Mugabe's one-man rule.

This \\"bifurcation\\" based on Thoreau's ideas of social reform and environmentalism in his writings \\"reproduces the human/nature duality at the root of ecological and racial hegemony.\\" Thoreau came to feel uneasy about this bifurcation; but he never explicitly renounced it or went beyond it even implicitly in his writings. To find expressions of the harmony, rather than the duality, between the human and nature inextricably bound in with real equality, Myers turns to works by Native Americans, but also by African Americans and some American authors of European heritage. African Americans essentially and intuitively have this harmony with nature from their origins in Africa and also their work on the land as slaves in America. He points to the 1988 nonfiction book \\"Mississippi Solo\\" by the African-American writer Eddy L. Harris--\\"an account of his solo canoe trip down the length of the Mississippi River\\"--as containing the \\"ecocentricity that respects the intrinsic value of the larger world and from which springs a consciousness of human equality and an imperative for social justice.\\" Myers does not attempt an exhaustive study of his subject, but rather presents a relatively abbreviated, though well-developed study of it; and along with this, persuasive analysis and reasoning in support of his point of view.	2005-08-29

But this doesn't mean they are anarchic, or are simply pleasing or inspired gatherings of images. Like music, the poems have no reason, but rather play out intimations and ideas inhering in their animating moods, memories, and thoughts. Though Barter uses a Beethoven cello sonata in tendering something about music which also wittingly or by intuition or chance refers to his own poetry, Barter's poetry is more like Bach's music than Beethoven's. The emotional restraint and preciseness of Barter's poems makes them more like Bach's music.	2005-08-29

The abnormalities of the main characters reflect the everyday hopes, dreams, aspirations, burdens, and frustrations of the wider world of normal individuals around them. Henry's friends accept his becoming \\"unhinged\\" from the death of his wife Cora, and \\"have learned to accommodate him.\\" This \\"accommodation\\" broadens to involve helping Henry pilfer steel spikes, empty oil drums, wooden planks, and other materials he needs for a large catapult which he believes will catapult him to the moon.

And with them, Kathrada played a leading, though for the most part less visible, role in developing a post-apartheid South African political and social system. Though apartheid was abandoned years ago, the full story of the struggle against it is just now beginning to emerge, as the leaders of this struggle are finding the time to write their memoirs in their later years after moving out of the political arena and giving way to the succeeding generation of leaders. Kathrada sees his own \\"Memoirs\\" as a \\"modest addition to the growing and most welcome body of work that is emerging about a particularly significant period in South Africa's recent history.\\" Kathrada's modesty kept him from moving into the political, governing, arena as visibly as others, notably Nelson Mandela.

By contrast, the large majority of Egyptian landowners were \\"specialized warriors known as Malmuks\\" who could not pass their land on to their heirs; and even their ownership of it was tenuous in the factional conflicts and intrigues in Egypt at the time. Borsch finds the answer to his main question of why England managed to recover economically after the Black Death while Egypt did not in this difference in land ownership. A considerable proportion of each country's population, including those who worked the land, succumbed to the plague; which some historians have likened to a nuclear holocaust in the areas it afflicted. England's system of land ownership was the decisive factor in its economic recovery in the years after the Black Death. In order to keep their land productive and thus valuable, England's landowners were obliged to adapt to the new power the surviving workers had gained in the agrarian economy with the loss of so many to the disease. The Malmuks in Egypt, on the other hand, had scant incentive to make any adaptations to hold up the value of land they had only a precarious ownership of. Borsch draws out the economic, social, and to a lesser degree the historical effects of this fundamental difference between English and Egyptian landownership in the late medieval period. An assistant professor teaching Islamic and Middle Eastern history as well as history of the world and Western civilization, he has the right learning for this work.	2005-08-29

Such hopes are often preceded by trenchant, riveting critiques on writings, ideas, and states of affairs; and sometimes the hopes are bound in with these in a struggle. Such struggling especially is the sign that besides having a cogent moral sense and articulated vision, Scully is a consummate realist. He does not abandon common, inevitable life for promises, visions, or programs of a heavenly life. What he surely does bring to light is the true notion that \\"ankle bracelets\\" need not be an inevitable or permanent part of life, nor be the defining attribute of it. The essays mostly and ostensibly about poetry, writing style, expression and all its sources and destinations are in a larger sense and ultimately about larger life than most are accustomed to, and than most can even conceive of. The essays packed with serious and reflective thought, earnest with teaching and persuasion, and buoyant with inspiration and possibility demonstrate once again that the best writing on politics, culture, and individual life and its choices usually comes from accomplished poets such as Scully. Essays of Seamus Heaney are another example.	2005-08-03

The association with classical learning and culture and the \\"enlightening\\" the audience of lyceum events would undergo were intentional. The idea of the lyceum in America arose in the early 1800s as a means to provide common knowledge and ideas, or at least some common experiences, for the population of an America that was expanding geographically, changing demographically from large numbers of immigrants, and engaging with the early phases of industrialism and new inventions such as the steamboat. Lyceums throughout the U. S., including frontier areas, were seen by both promoters and audiences as matrixes for unity and communication for the increasingly complex democratic society. In spite of the high-mindedness and vision of their originators, it wasn't long before lyceums were holding circus-like entertainments and other events straying from their intended purposes. But lyceums drew large local audiences wherever they were held, inevitably playing a large part in forming the democratic public culture, much as the universality and eclecticism of television does today. The lyceum--the numerous ones in all parts of the country--is studied not only as representing the diversity and interests of 19th-century America, but also as a central, fundamental ground of rhetoric as \\"that art by which culture and community and character are constituted and transformed.\\" Though \\"lyceum\\" is now an antique word and only traces of the idealism of its originators remain, one recognizes by Ray's historical and social study that the lyceum contributed greatly to the foundation of a unique American culture.

Although this School is usually described as having a Marxist perspective, the social criticism of Adorno is not doctrinaire or propagandistic. Adorno's writings--as this current publication testifies again--have stood the test of time for their acuteness, rigor, and application of first-rate intellectual powers to subjects of the contemporary society. These qualities of Adorno's critical thinking are evident as well in his work \\"In Search of Wagner.\\" In a 20-page introductory foreword, the philosopher/social critic Slavoj Zizek takes up the question \\"Why Is Wagner Worth Saving?\\" Wagner's music, ideas, and biography continue to draw the attention of thinkers in various fields because exploration of these and positions reached regarding them yield insights and assessments on power, anti-Semitism, art, psychology, and politics in the modern world. Written in the late 1930s, \\"In Search of Wagner\\" demonstrates Adorno's innovative, timely, and valuable methodology as it grapples with central questions of modern culture.	2005-08-03

At the heart of these were emotions and ideas about the desirability and potency of abstinence. However, this was not chastity in the religious sense, but rather a suppressed eroticism which reflected both the sense of futility relating to an apocalyptic outlook and also the anomalous hope of spiritual regeneration and transformation. Matich--professor of Russian literature and culture at the U. of California, Berkeley--lays out the varied symbols, literature, and practices of this peculiar Russian turn relating to perceived decadence in the latter 19th-century political and social disruptions and concomitant anxieties in Russia and parts of Europe. The Russian writers Tolstoy and Alexander Blok and the philosopher Dmitri Merezhovsky and the woman Zinaida Grippius with whom he had a relationship are among those critiqued for bases and variations of this Russian blending of eroticism, spirituality, vision, and politics. Matich has a solid hand on this heretofore obscure vein of Russian fin-de-siecle culture ordinarily dominated by radical political philosophers, social anarchists, and the writer Dostoevsky. The author brings cogency and breadth, and thus allure and longevity, to the subject.	2005-08-03

A professor of Literature and Language at Northern Kentucky U. and former president of the Melville Society, Wallace found his intuition that Douglass and Melville were connected in significant ways \\"deepened and expanded in multiple ways\\" as he researched and wrote this work. No one can argue with this after reading his work with much visual matter emphasizing the ties between these two important literary and cultural figures. Stories of Melville's and essays of Douglass's deal with individuals at the bottom or margins of society, the cruelties of physical punishment, and also the characteristic perspectives and abilities of individuals treated as less than human. An accessible work for young adults and adults that with its plumbing of comparisons of the works and concerns of Melville and Douglass sheds new light not only on them, but also American society in the years leading up to the Civil War.	2005-08-03

Burke uncovers and analyzes documents which call into question statements and testimony given by such persons that at the time were used to convict and execute by hanging twenty local Irishmen. Burke, an Irishman from the Pennsylvania region where the violent labor strife of the latter 1800s occurred with ancestors who were miners, writes an absorbing account that will alter any reader's perspective on this historical episode of an early U.S. labor conflict involving the different players of the Irish laborers, mine owners, local residents, and government agencies.

She not only has a sharp eye, but also ranges widely over popular culture for examples of this. Any reader will run across new instances of errant patriotism, infantile trust, political ignorance, and rational concerns mutated into mythic horrors. And for the generally familiar instances such as the Washington D. C. sniper murders and the anthrax scares, the author brings out new facets of these. Willis discloses what the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse reveals about aspects of American society; and sees the values (e. g., the exclusionary social ideal of the white Protestant male) and activities of the Ku Klux Klan mirrored in the posturing, mores, and policies of the Bush White House. Surely controversial, but Willis's critique raises issues the country will have to deal with positively if it is to have a role of world leadership and stop the disintegration of the domestic social fabric.	2005-07-06

But Zhukov's claim to historical importance goes beyond this. He played a key role in defeating the Japanese in their invasion of Manchuria, which freed Russian forces for the later encounter with the Germans along the whole border of eastern Russia. Zhukov prevented the Germans from taking Leningrad and Moscow before turning them back with victory at Stalingrad. After this, it was Zhukov who was given orders by Stalin to take Berlin. Colvin's biography concentrates on the Soviet general's strategic planning and the the outcomes of this, including the abortive Operation Mars which is a puzzling and destructive anomaly in Zhukov's otherwise highly capable, occasionally brilliant, and undeniably critical role in Russia's defeat of the Germans in World War II. Zhukov's independence from Stalin while also being his favorite is a vein of the biography. That Zhukov managed to survive Stalin's murderous purges of top Red Army officers testifies to Stalin's recognition of Zhukov's irreplaceable military abilities. This work follows an earlier one by Colvin titled \\"Nomonhan\\" on the Russo-Japanese War preceding WWII in which Zhukov's decisive part is covered extensively.	2005-07-06

Dovid Katz's biographical and literary introduction is over 100 pages. In Harry Smith's seven-page Preface, he notes that Menke Katz's poems \\"spanned the alleys of Michaleshik [in Katz's homeland of Lithuania] and the streets of New York--folklore and factories, the Hill of Svir and skyscraper, the Kabbalah's mysticism and the Talmud's reaching, against the horrors and wonders of the 20th century.\\" Katz was a lifelong refugee, not only from the mid 20th-century troubles of Europe in which Jews bore the brunt, but also from many of the trends and conventions of modernism. Although Katz's poems are unmistakably modernist, they maintain a pronounced singular touch. Because he was a freethinker who would, for example, begin experimenting in his late poems, Katz cannot be pigeonholed with any school, style, or group; although he was a friend or associate of many writers and artists who were. The restlessness, ambivalences, yearnings, and disappointments of this status of being an outsider of history and nationalities surface in the poems--e. g., \\"In my alleys--the gray houses/clamor for light/Like blind crows with shorn wings...\\" [from Night in Downtown}; \\"Lest you cry recall/That a stray spark of light goes out somewhere/Lully-lully-lullaby, my orphan,/Lully-lullaby.\\" [from \\"A Kind of a Lullaby] The course of Katz's long poetic career embraces the horrors, sadnesses, and hopes of the 20th century, the pains and perspectives of the Jewish emigre crystallizing those of multitudes of moderns in the conflicts and the rush of the 20th century, and the particular wisdom, wit, and expression of Yiddish culture. Comprehension and appreciation of 20th-century Jewish and Yiddish literature, and of poetry in particular, without familiarity with Menke Katz's poetry is incomplete.	2005-07-06

His controversial term as Viceroy in Ireland during the time of the \\"Troubles\\" there did nothing to improve his reputation. Scandals in his personal life involving a series of mistresses, including the wife of a fellow officer, only further tarnished his name. Holmes does not find any grounds for elevating French's reputation. What he does is add a new dimension to this historical character by relating French's torments over the large number of deaths resulting from his leadership in the First World War along with the general carnage of the War. These concerns that dogged French are found mostly in his private papers, creating discordance between his public image as an unfeeling military leader and his private reflections. Holmes concludes that \\"in many respects, [French] never transcended the nineteenth century.\\" By temperament, training, class, and expectations of himself and his peers, French was unable to effectively come to grips with either military or political problems of the early 20th century.	2005-07-06

But Wells' is the only one to hone in on how Americans' sense of time was changed, and the effects this had on many areas of society and how modernity developed in America. Basically, the sense of time changed from one that was attuned to nature and religion to one that was related to time as experienced on the battlefield or in relation to battles. \\"The war years introduced a new complicated time to the American people, as events on the battlefield impinged on, overrode, and rearranged antebellum schedules...A convoluted mixture of God's time, natural times, personal times, and clock times, battle time was a ruling time that created a temporal web within which soldiers fought.\\" Not only soldiers in battle developed a different sense of time, but so did nurses in hospitals, for instance, as they waited for casualities to start coming in and when they did, engaged in intense efforts to treat their wounds in a time determined by events on the battlefield. The workplace freed blacks tried to enter in the post-War decades and the habits, skills, discipline, etc., required in it were formed largely by the new sense of time engendered in the masses of men who served as soldiers in the conflict. All of the soldiers' activities, from camp life to furloughs, was pervaded by recently-fought or coming battles. The pre-War sense of time that was esentially personal gave way to a sense of time that was both remote and more controlling, and in some ways more fateful.

Dikovitsky steps back from this common use of the term visual culture to try to define and comprehend it by exploring \\"the history, theoretical frameworks, methodology, and pedagogy of visual culture in the United States.\\" She does this mostly by interviews with college professors in fields ranging from art, film studies, and cultural studies to literature which in one way or another take into account the pronounced and often dominating or suppressive nature of the visual in modern culture. The word \\"study\\" in the subtitle connotes not so much Dikovitskaya's study of visual culture--although this is inevitably inherent--as it does the author's chosen task to report how visual culture is being studied mostly in the universities; and along with this answer the question of how it is to be studied so it is understood properly. Without a proper understanding of visual culture, contemporary society cannot be understood properly; contemporary society is a mystery. While not defining visual culture definitively, if this can ever be done, Dikovitskaya's exploration, framing of issues, and probing interviews bring the sprawling, elusive, omnipresent presence and idea of visual culture into clearer focus. Dikovitskaya is a research fellow at the Library of Congress.	2005-07-06

Among the mixed biographical and literary topics concerning this major American playwright Alexander brings clarity to from poring over material lately uncovered and rereadings of some known material are O'Neill's suicide attempt, his illness of tuberculosis, and his relationship with his parents. Alexander, professor emerita of English at CUNY, gives only passing conjecture on why such \\"myths\\" arose in the first place or persisted on the basis of nonexistent, scant, or clearly contradictory evidence. The reasons for such errors or misguided interpretations of O'Neill's late plays--no doubt growing out of an awe and mystique surrounding O'Neill as a deeply impressive, preternaturally gifted playwright--is an absorbing topic on its own--but beyond the interest or scope of Alexander here. The author focuses on how such errors came to be, and on clearing them up. In this, she brings much clarity, and sometimes definitiveness, to mistakenly held views and some outright fictions of both O'Neill's life and his late plays, all without lowering this playwright's stature.	2005-07-06

During these years, Bridgeport was a bustling city with businesses of all kinds and a vacation destination for the well-to-do from New York City and nearby areas. The postcards show the factories, restaurants, mansions, shopping districts, amusements, and parks and seasides which made Bridgeport an outstanding regional city during the early decades of the 1900s. Bridgeport's P. T. Barnum and the famous Pleasure Beach amusement park are also included in the period postcards. Pehanick's postcard collection shows buildings and scenes that are now gone; and it can be used as a guide for the enjoyable pastime of comparing locations then and now.	2005-07-06

Its beginnings were in the \\"nascent bourgeoisie...philosophical, economic, and political circumstances\\" of late seventeenth century England. Especially, the \\"new architectural type [of] the compact bourgeois villa\\" came to be seen as an ideal residence by the nascent bourgeois public. This architecture type allowed for a \\"new settlement pattern\\" different from the traditional ones of dense urban development and sprawling manors--namely, suburbia with its homes surrounded by lawns clustered in country-like areas. Along with laying out the cultural and philosophical origins of suburbia, including the developing concept of the self, Archer presents both sides of the assessment of suburbia. In modern-day America, where the majority of the population now live in suburbia, there has for many decades been an ongoing debate over whether suburbia is the acme of the American dream of prosperity and upward mobility or an illusion entailing the stifling of individuality and cultivation of materialism. Archer's book is substantive enough to be a text in college courses on suburban studies, while also being accessible and engaging enough as a timely work of cultural studies for the general reader. The author is a professor of cultural studies and comparative literature at the U. of Minnesota. With material ranging from Enlightenment English philosophy to portrayals of suburbia in recent movies, from architectural plans of the \\"compact bourgeois villa\\" to inventions such as lawnmowers and economic changes such as new banking practices associated with suburbia, the work demonstrates how fertile this subject is while bringing it into focus and drawing the avenues for further exploration of it.	2005-07-06

The careers of most artists whose art displayed such different aspects and such breadth, as well as changes in genres and subjects, would be described as \\"checkered\\" or \\"interesting.\\" But Helion is not simply categorized as this. Despite such heterogeneity over the decades of his work from the 1920s to the 1980s, Helion manifestly surpasses such labelings. For the abstract works with a constructivist accent thru the still lifes and figures of his latter decades, Helion's work evidences a consistent boldness; not only in coloration, but also composition and assorted inner forms. About 125 pages of color pictures of paintings divided into mostly subject and a couple of stylistic categories illustrate this notable modern painter's range of subjects and movement regarding styles. The chronology of more than 20 pages of smaller type with many photographic insets is virtually a compendious biography of Helion. The five-page bibliography of the same smaller type contains hundreds of entries. In short, this work is the present major publication on Jean Helion; and with its high quality of production and design and its encompassing content, will probably stand for a long time as the major introduction and reference on Helion.	2005-07-06

Then in a tone sometimes cranky, sometimes mischievous, sometimes empathetic, sometimes humbled--but never arrogant, supercilious, or preachy--the character Grandmother spins out an observation or remarks containing her wisdom gained from decades of involvement in relationships of all kinds and nearby nature. With Grandmother's unpredictable, idiosyncratic, yet unfailingly discerning appearances in the varied situations, she is like the trickster figure of Native American folk lore. She is pictured on the cover dressed something like a old Eskimo woman with hands on hips yelling out something.

Not having much money as well as prompted by the desire to shirk the \\"rampant materialism\\" he found in large chain stores, malls, and mainstream retailing, Leslie made the decision to buy only secondhand goods when he needed something despite the extra time this often required, with no guarantee that he would ever find what he was looking for. But before long, these drawbacks were put out of mind as the author became ever more involved in, and fascinated and delighted by what he found in this supposedly marginal, but thriving and populous area of American society. \\"In the secondhand culture, I have discovered the joys of a genuine American market, unfettered buying and selling, which most first-level retailing has lost.\\" Leslie has become friends with many dealers he has met. The author's ventures into all aspects of this secondhand culture from major international auction houses, regional and local auctions and flea markets, neighborhood tag sales, and also the world's largest and longest flea markets also serve as a guide for anyone wishing to become more involved in this market as either a buyer or seller. Leslie teaches at Siena College in upper New York, which also happens to be a prime area for the secondhand market he was drawn to and colorfully and fully recounts.	2005-07-06

Like most other Legionnaires, Parris joined from a deep sense of disappointment after certain difficult experiences in his life; although he left the Legion after a few years and is now living in England married with children. The challenging training takes place in environments as varied as French Guyana, North Africa desert, and hills of Corsica, with Parris and his fellow recruits having to master different skills and succeed at different objectives in each.

All were pathways to God. In the early days of Christianity, the ascetic habits and spiritual practices and thoughts of a small number of men and women going out to desert areas in Egypt and neighboring areas helped not only to preserve the germ of Christianity against the barbarian invasions of Europe, but also to found a model for spiritual life and cast of mind of devout Christian believers for all ages. Keller is a clergyman who leads retreats and at one time headed a religious center. This learned overview of early Christian monasticism and asceticism is mainly a series of biographical portraits of several notable holy men and women with attention to principles in their lives (e. g., silence, praxis) which can be cultivated in anyone's life for greater spirituality and to spiritual thoughts of theirs which can be readily apprehended and reflected on by anyone. The author succeeds in his twin aims of highlighting the lives and spirituality of the extraordinary holy men and women and answering the question he poses, \\"What is the significance of their experience and wisdom for our lives today?\\"	2005-07-06

McKanna goes beyond the by-now familiar charge that the Apaches, as a minority ethnic group in lands taken over by white settlers, got no justice to speak of. His main concern is how the system worked against the defendants, even when circumstances and in some cases physical evidence raised questions about the murder charges. The author also views the acts of the Native Americans against the backdrop of ill-defined laws and jurisdiction in the recently-formed territory and age-old Apache culture, which was undergoing a combination of forced and voluntary transition. McKanna's accounts are like popular case-book studies of the cases against the Indians with a sociological factor brought in. He teaches American Indian history at San Diego State U. and has written previous books on the inter-related subjects of crime and race.	2005-07-06

With the Philippines, Hawaii, and San Francisco in his background, he effortlessly, sometimes profligately, conjures up the diverse parts of circumstances. While these are paradoxical or overwhelming for many, with Linmark, they are bound by his energy and brightness. In some cases, they are bound by his empathy too, as when he assumes a different character and sometimes the other gender. As references to Kierkegaard and a few poems which reach out to a higher power suggest, the eclectic, unpredictable objects and thoughts of the poems are not distractions, but rather are often occasions for a different, nontraditional, manner of reflection or meditation.	2005-05-29

Returning to the domestic society with their memories of the realities of war, as well as knowledge of their own fears, conflicts, and roles in the carnage, the legions of men also returned to a society which had worked admirably without them in maintaining order, demonstrating patriotism, and producing prodigious amounts of war supplies and consumer goods. The patriarchal \\"fictions\\" about men were in shambles. This work \\"explores the way photography functioned within the postwar restructuring of the dominant fiction.\\" Photography accomplished this by presenting images of men which reestablished them at the head of the social structure in roles that were desirable and beneficial. No longer seen by themselves or those who remained on the \\"home front,\\" especially women, as saving the society, the men came to be seen by themselves and women in respectable and romantic ways reflecting American ideals of individual worth and ability, mastery of one's own situation and destiny, and autonomy. The five main types of images were \\"breadwinner, warrior, tough guy, playboy, and rebel.\\" Vettel-Becker, professor of art history at Montana State U.-Billings, writes a cultural study of how each of these was created by media photography, and each image's part in making male ego whole and restoring male superiority in postwar American society. One chapter, \\"Female Body,\\" showing a few photos of naked women, looks at how the eroticized image of women worked so men could regain the position they had lost due to the \\"historical trauma\\" they suffered from World War II.	2005-05-29

Both immigrant women and \\"Yankee\\" women migrating from eastern parts of the U. S. accomplished this by joining the men in practically any work that had to be done. But in addition, it was primarily the women who looked to education and health care for children, the development of community by establishing civic and religious organizations, and all kinds of personal and public commitments making for a lasting society which could be handed down to future generations. At the time the northern plains, particularly the area of the state of North Dakota, was being settled, the Indians had been mostly pacified and farm machinery and electricity were changing the work of farming. Nonetheless, the settlement of one of the last western frontiers called for all the determination, enterprise, imagination, and hope from the women as settlement in any other time or area. Handy-Marchello, a history professor at the U. of North Dakota, gives equal treatment to both the physical challenges (e. g., the weather, making fields for crops) and how these were faced and also the indefatigable pioneer spirit of the varied women. And in the course of doing this, the author notes how the pioneer women's spirit and contributions continue to shape the regional society.	2005-05-29

The general theme running through all of the diversified articles is the \\"America Dream\\" and the \\"American Tragedy\\" reflected in the histories of the teams and the careers and lives of individual players. The American Dream part of the theme deals with how playing baseball allowed players to strive for high personal achievement as well as enjoy various levels of economic security and social recognition. The American Tragedy part takes in not only the racism and discrimination players faced, but also personal troubles and disappointments of some of them. Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, and Willie Mays appear along with many relative unknowns. The exploits of teams named the Fergus Falls Musculars, the Quicksteps, and the Brown Stockings, among others, are related. The vibrant Minnesota black baseball scene going back well over a century is treated in a popular style profiling great and other notable players and following the courses, and occasional dramatic moments, of the teams.	2005-05-29

The poet does not nostalgically pine for or color the past because it is so lively in his memory anyway. That a \\"shopping mall and a big/black parking lot\\" have replaced the packed-dirt basketball court of the poet's youth is not cause for sorrow or regret because when he sees this, the poet hears in his mind \\"that leather swish/inside a cord net like the sound/of an angel landing in heaven.\\" [from \\"Barnyard Hoops\\"] The poet has memories which nothing can take away from him. But these do not pale the immediate or remove the poet from it. Rather, they give fullness and a wide emotional expanse to the present; as when in \\"Going to Church\\" two elderly widowers smile and move with a grace that \\"says ladies they love/are going to church, too.\\" Throughout his life, Krapf has retained his connection to his German ancestry in various ways.

The global communications network for organizing and reporting the demonstrations against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999, email art, computer-created and disseminated music, and telecommunication are among the subjects examined in exploring the new forms of art and activism with the erosion of the lines between art, communication, technology, and computer science in contemporary culture.

The essays as a whole give an unrivaled, panoramic view of what is going on in the broad, modern-day field which has come to be known as the media.

Associate professor of Latin American history at Arizona State U.-Tempe, Powers describes and analyzes how native women of all classes, tribes, and varied capabilities and ingenuity adapted to the patriarchal culture imposed on them by the Spanish conquerors. Virtually all of the women were forced into certain positions resulting in a \\"demotion in status.\\" Marriage, slavery, employment, and prostitution were among these. But in many cases--Powers's main topic of interest--women tried to varying degrees of success to keep or regain the equal, respected status they had in their Native American cultures. For example, some women became landowners.

The principles of the many facets of Catholic social work are specified \\"to sustain and foster the activity of Catholics in the social sector, especially the activity of the lay faithful.\\" There's no guidance on the practicalities or pragmatics of realizing the principles; the \\"Compendium\\" is not a how-to. Parts of it are almost theological in tone, e. g., \\"God's Plan and the Mission of the Church.\\" And other parts such as those dealing with the \\"way of love\\" or alluding to the \\"new heaven\\" and the \\"new earth\\" are visionary and inspirational. Half a dozen or more footnotes on every page point to historical or doctrinal bases for the principles; most of which are found in papal encyclicals. The family, peace, human rights, work, and politics are major sections. An \\"Analytical Index\\" of 150 pages takes one to any particular topic one is looking for. The format is each of the numerous social principles in italics followed by brief commentary in regular type. The \\"Compendium\\" is not only a comprehensive new edition gathering Catholic doctrine relating to social work. With recurring references to moral issues raised by advances in medicine, globalization, and other contemporary matters, it carries these principles into today's world and its central social developments.	2005-05-01

Individual poems have been published in The Pittsburgh Quarterly, Connecticut Review, and the Haight-Ashbury Literary Journal. Poems of Andersen's have also not surprisingly been published in Blue Collar Review and The Progressive. For the poet has stayed in touch with his blue-collar, working-class background. He doesn't write from the stance of the outsider or the rebel, but as one whose status and aspirations are not given by birthright or privilege. He doesn't so much struggle for what he achieves, but rather gains it by cleverness and fortune; as when arriving early to a Pete Seeger concert, he finds \\"all doors chained or locked but one,\\" which one he goes through, and after making his way down \\"dark hallways\\" comes upon the famous singer, who \\"waved me over to sit on a folding chair beside him.\\" [from \\"True Story\\"] By similar combinations of desire, luck, determination, and wit, Andersen regularly achieves such moments. They come about sometimes in nature, sometimes in a city, and sometimes in thinking about his father's life or aspects of the past. These moments are not restorative or epiphanic, as they would be for most poets. Andersen is not a romantic. Nonetheless, he realizes the value of such moments; and he is thankful for them, or else he could not put them so clearly.	2005-05-01

It is the language of a distinct ethnic group from the middle of Southeast Asia, roughly the northern part of Burma and neighboring part of China. But this group has been dispersed by the currents of history and encroachments of modernity. Mong is a specialist in the history of the Shan people and their language. He follows the development of the Shan language primarily through its manuscripts from the probable origins of the Shan alphabet to the present-day threats to its survival. The language mostly developed naturally, but at times its adherents had to devise strategies to keep it from fading away. Parts of the book are passages, sometimes fairly lengthy ones, in the Shan language, especially where the author analyzes changes in it during different stages of its development. But these passages can be glossed over by the large majority not knowing Shan to nonetheless still comprehend this book on this historically and culturally significant, yet now fragile Southeast Asian language.	2005-05-01

Modern and postmodern poets with their exceptional openness, familiarity with the contingencies of identity, and cross-cultural recognition and status are especially attuned to how travel affects one's life and how the modern habit of travel symbolizes essentials of modern life. The poets capture in the words and images of their poems the new, disorienting, etc., qualities of travel. Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, John Ashbery, and Derek Walcott are looked to individually for what travel signifies in the postcolonial era. The Beat poets are treated as a group. Through Gray's original and revealing readings of poems concerning travel, one learns much about the state of postmodernity.	2005-05-01

Cole is interested especially in the sources of the music Davis produced in this last period of his prolific and influential career and how each piece was recorded. Such interests are related to Cole's writings as a journalist in the fields of music and technology. The author's keen interest in Davis's place in these fields extends to answering how Davis came up with the titles for each of his recordings. To answer this and other questions, Cole went to musicians who worked with Miles Davis and also the technicians who recorded his pieces. The business of promoting Davis's albums by Columbia and Warner is also covered. A singular look into the last stage of Davis's long, somewhat checkered career gained from varied sources; which at the same time gives a picture of the modern music business.	2005-05-01

Starting in the 1770s, it carried Euroamerican settlers of all groups and classes to what was at the time America's western frontier. U. S. Highway 68 now follows part of the old Maysville Road; while other stretches have become parts of farms and woodlands. The Road not only played a key part in the beginnings of the United State's westward expansion, but it was also an early symbol of the freedom, opportunities, and new beginnings of the American dream. \\"More than a narrative of regional improvements and national political personalities...[the book] employs the biography of a road...as a microhistory of social and cultural change in the Early American Republic.\\" Friend's narrative history focuses on the main types of individuals, families, and groups migrating to the area along the road in different periods. The first pioneers gave way to gentry from Virginia and other mid-Atlantic states; who in turn gave way to businessmen and immigrants. The blending and compromising among the groups led eventually to the formation and \\"triumph\\" of the middle class. In 1830, Henry Clay proposed a Maysville Road Bill for bringing government-funded improvement to the area; but this was vetoed by President Andrew Jackson. Friend is an associate professor of history at the U. of Central Florida who has written other books on Kentucky and edits the \\"Florida Historical Quarterly.\\"	2005-05-01

The kachina dolls of Southwest American tribes are examples of this; as are the totems of African tribes. But Malangi's Australian aboriginal art has stayed away from this tendency. The reason for this is not only Malangi's deep attachment to the aboriginal art and the culture it grows out of, but also his use of natural pigments and other natural, traditional, materials. Most of his works shown are natural pigments on eucalyptus bark, with others natural pigments on wood, and a couple using feathers as well. The sinuous, complex shapes and vivid, intermixed colors for which Australian aboriginal art has gained worldwide notice are retained practically unaffected in Malangi's art. The many works included are known as recent--from the 1960s to the 1990s--from their lack of wear, but not from any stylization as an influence of or concession to public or commercial art. Introductory essays with photos in the margins give the physical and cultural, anthropological, sources of Malangi's art.	2005-05-01

Many of the responses angle into the explicit and implicit influences of the region a particular poet is from, such as Florida, the South in general, or New England. Some poets who have moved to one or more different places reflect on changes in impressions and attachments to place. Nikki Giovanni, Peter Cooley, Mark Strand, and Charles Wright are among the poets whose names will be recognized by many. There's snapshots of some of the poets, or a photo of a local scene.

The works without color are more than a contrast, like a shadow, alluding to primary works. For Richter, colorlessness has its own status and value. Richter remarks, \\"Gray is the welcome and only possible equivalence for indifference, non-commitment, absence of opinion, absence of shape.\\" About 40 works of different shapes, sizes, and mediums in various shades of light and dark from a smoke-like gray to a dense, pitch, black with occasional flecks or limited hues of color illustrate Richter's regard of gray. One cannot understand Richter's place as one of the foremost contemporary artists nor his intents as an artist without taking into account this \\"motif\\" of his art based on this regard.	2005-04-30

The third essay has photographs of pencils, felt-tip pens, and eye droppers this major modern artist used in creating such works. Seventy-eight are pictured in color one per page in chronological order in one gallery-like section of this larger, rectangular-shaped book. Pollock's works are familiar, and need no general commentary. The more-focused, particularly revealing artistic theme of the essays is Pollock's liberty with lines, or edges. As the numerous works on paper show, his progress in this technique and impulse gave him unprecedented freedom and novelty as an artist. One follows the expansion of Pollock's liberty with line and corresponding new dimensions of artistic freedom over the course of this time. Early, roughly representational works and others indicating the probable influence of Miro and de Kooning lead to the more complex, abstract art that is regarded as typifying Pollock. The chronological presentation and analytic essays (in German) allow one to gain a particularly revealing understanding of the artistic achievement of this groundbreaking modern artist. The work is the catalog for an exhibition of these works of Pollock's that was in Germany and is in New York until the Fall 2005.	2005-04-30

Chapters two thru five of this book are revisions and summaries of parts of the previous work. What is new to this book are its introductory memoir \\"On Becoming an African American Scholar,\\" its Introduction, chapters one and six thru eight, and the conclusion. A professor of English at Pennsylvania State U., Bell both expansively and acutely deals with the body of African American literature. His knowledge of this field is encyclopedic. While sharing in the common origin of the folk literature, African American literature nonetheless reflects broader literary movements such as neorealism, modernism, and postmodernism. Such authors have also had the outstanding talent and creativity to develop distinctive styles and voices. This voluminous, comprehensive study also ranges to what Bell terms \\"paraliterature,\\" which might also be called popular literature. This includes pulp fiction, formulaic adventure stories, supernatural tales, romances, science fiction, mystery and crime, and gay literature. Bell does not force these greatly diversified genres ranging from the enduring literary works of Richard Wright and Toni Morrison to the science fiction of Ray Delany and the mysteries of Walter Mosby into a procrustean bed of the folk tale sources of all. Rather, his ingenious linking of them together while doing justice to their uniqueness creates a constellation of African American literature which is both a guide to it and inducement for exploration of it.	2005-04-30

It's impossible to say how the slave Brace's story is colored by this. In the Introduction, Winter points to some known omissions. Brace's Christian faith and knowledge of the Bible seem to begin too early in his story; and with long passages from the Bible liberally and somewhat arbitrarily inserted in the text, intrude to a questionable, and certainly unnecessary, degree. Prentiss was attracted to Brace's life story because of how it could promote his abolitionist views rooted in his Christian faith. Brace was a decent person caught up in events far beyond his understanding or concern. He enlisted to fight in the Revolutionary War mainly to gain his freedom. After being freed for his service, he moved from Connecticut, where he was owned by a cruel slavemaster, to Vermont, where he continued to bear physical and financial difficulties. The facts of Brace's colorful, moving tale can be readily sifted out from Prentiss's extraneous matter--leaving a rare, memorable biography of a slave in the North, whose circumstances and options were considerably different from slaves in the South. The circumstances of Brace's capture in Africa and his time in Vermont in the last years of his life are of particular interest. <br />	2005-03-29

Eleven essays by authors with a surprisingly eclectic background--including college teachers in archaeology and ethnology, museum curators, a biologist, and a poet--focus on particular topics of this African island nation's textiles attracting wide notice because of their quality of production, colorfulness, and social significance. An island that has for centuries been a crossroads of trade and migrations from southern Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, Madagascar textiles are particularly complex and diverse; and because of this historical background, they have special meaning for the different groups of the society, as well as for interaction among groups. Textile traditions in different geographical areas, reviews of collections of textiles, the wear of textiles at social events, and the island's silk moths are among the topics.

First published by the publisher Micah in 1954, the book was reissued in 1982 with six lengthy commentaries by noted theologians. This third edition adds four more commentaries. Reinhold Niebuhr and Tony Kushner are familiar contributors. The historical tie of Jews to the land of Israel and the fundamental role of \\"Palestinian Jewry...in shaping Jewish history\\" are two of several avenues pursued in forming an understanding of the vital place of Israel in Jewish history, religion, and psychology. Parkes' work and the elucidating commentaries aim not at resolutions for the conflict, but for understanding and comprehension of it--and in this, they succeed estimably. <br />	2005-03-29

Carpenter gets behind the devastating effects of alcohol, disease, warfare, and displacement to disclose and understand how these tribes tried to make sense of and adjust to these by modifications of their mythologies and related cultural factors. For instance, when the Indians became involved in fur trading, they \\"had to transform the beaver from a creature they accorded a measure of respect\\" because of its place in their myths and lore into a commodity. Similarly, the author goes into how Christianity affected the Indians' outlook when they did not convert outright to this religion spread by French Jesuits. The coming of the Europeans also changed the Indians' manner of warfare, from mostly skirmishes with little loss of life to an form of total war where villages were destroyed and their inhabitants taken into captivity. Carpenter is an assistant professor of history at Canada's U. of Saskatchewan whose work sheds light on the impact of Europeans on the minds and behavior of Native American tribes. Most of the scholarship in this area has looked to the external consequences such as drunkenness or migration; whereas Carpenter's gets to the changes in the fundamentals of the Native American's culture. <br />	2005-03-29

The activities between the two parties have a resemblance to the diplomatic activities between two countries. On a trip to England to get guidance on the developing negotiations, Oglethorpe took Tomochichi and other Creeks as representatives of the Creek nation. The relationship between the Creeks and the Georgia colony eventually worked out involved trade, land rights, and legal protections; and it was the basis for a military alliance in the War of Jenkin's Ear against the Spanish over differences in north Florida. The \\"charter\\" between the English colonists and the Creeks did not hold up with the coming of the Revolutionary War. In the early 1800s, the Creeks were relocated to Oklahoma. Sweet's account of this exceptional charter, or treaty, between European colonists and Native Americans evidences sophisticated and enlightened political behavior by both parties. This author is an assistant professor of history at Baylor. <br />	2005-03-29

Yet the psychology of either side as accounting for the origins of the conflict or as a basic factor in sustaining it is not dealt with as a particular subject in any book; and is rarely even referred to in the volumes literature. Falk is an Israeli psychologist concentrating in political psychology and psychohistory who goes into this ignored psychological factor in depth. The psychology of the opposing sides as formed by their histories, ethnicity, and ties to the land is analyzed, as well as the psychology of leaders of each side, particularly Ariel Sharon and Yassir Arafat. \\"Psychogeography\\" is used to clarify the fierce competing visions for the same relatively small area of the Middle East the Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting over for decades. Falk's chapter on \\"The Psychology of Suicide Bombers\\" is especially timely and informative considering 9/11 and current events in Iraq. <br />	2005-03-29

The Part One focuses on the Maritime Algonquin, St. Lawrence and Ontario Iroquois, the Native Americans of the Glen Meyer/Western Basin, and the Northern Algonquin cultures. The geographical area encompassed in this Part is eastern Canada to the Prairie provinces and northward to the subarctic regions of this wide stretch of present-day Canada and parts of the United States. The Great Lakes area is also included. In accordance with a basically anthropological work, the abundant and diverse matter is divided into scientific-like sections such as cultural origins and descendants, subsistence, settlement patterns, cosmology, and external relationships for each of the identifiable Native American groups. The only note of history brought into the material is discussion of the major cultural changes brought on by the Agricultural Revolution beginning about 500A.D. The pages are numbered from 1185 to 1666 since the work is part of a series; although it stands alone in compiling the anthropological matter in the field it has outlined and picturing much of this in photographic plates.	2005-03-29

The period of time covered is wide also--from the 1500s to the present. The 11 collected essays treat the movement of \\"crops and techniques of cultivation, rumors, radical plebeian ideas, workers, sailors, and prisoners\\" in spreading political and social ideas throughout this wide area over the several centuries. This is seen as a kind of cross-pollenization, or a vein of globalization going on in the countries touched by the Atlantic since the Renaissance. In places, some authors discuss how the cultivation of a new crop such as corn or potatoes or tobacco brought to another country or an overseas market for it played a role in the dissemination and formation of agrarianism. One learns that there are historical and ongoing ways other than diplomacy, wars, books and the media, and immigration that particular ideas and perspectives spread in the world. These ideas spread and are shaped both by acceptance of them and resistance to them. Except for a couple, the essays' authors are college professors of history. The editors are authors of books in the areas of agrarianism and political and social ideas. <br />	2005-03-29

Yet, the first of this line of modern divas, she was vulnerable in ways that those following her were not--vulnerable both to illusions she created in her own mind and also to the designs of others on her. These others included Gilded Age tycoons and European royalty she met as she performed throughout the U. S. and Europe. Her marriage to a Cuban Lothario named Antonio Terry was especially destructive. With little protections against the harmful penchants of her own nature or guidance from any cautionary tales in the new environment of celebrity, media, high financial stakes, and notoriety by association that many sought from her, Sanderson suffered breakdowns onstage and practically continuous emotional pain and confusion. She died at 38 from an illness made worse by her ignoring her doctor's advice; which led some to believe she had intentionally brought on her own death. Hansen's is a voluminous biography of this latter 19th-century opera star whose fame in her day has been eclipsed by others who followed in her pattern of international fame, cult-like adulation, and impetuousness. With research from papers kept by Sanderson's relatives--often quoting from these--and a skillful balance of the many sides of her life, it's a basic resource for any study of Sanderson. Winsor uses his impressive background in music for a biography that is sympathetic and insightful. <br />	2005-03-29

For the most part, African Americans were not so much trying to make a new political order or create new social and economic ground as simply acting in self-defense. This makes sense when one considers that at the time, blacks were subject to institutionalized racism and frequently the targets of violence by whites with the tacit approval of the white political and legal authorities. In such circumstances, self-defense \\"was an essential part of the struggle for citizenship itself.\\" Struggling for equality in education, employment, opportunity, etc., the various forms of black activism from Martin Luther King's nonviolent tactics to demonstrations and boycotts to occasional armed resistance cannot be regarded as anything other than self -defense; which self-defense is recognized in law and is an inherent part of psychology and behavior of all individuals. The title comes from Malcolm X's comment that he was urging African Americans to return \\"pure fire\\" to whites' hatred and suppression of them. Strain--teaching history and American studies at Florida Atlantic U.--also notes a statement by a Robert Williams before a Congressional committee that he urged his followers that \\"we should fight for the enforcement of the Constitution of the United States.\\" Others have noted the character of self-defense in the civil-rights activism. But Strain goes far beyond simply giving a nod to this. He explores debates within the black community on the effectiveness and risks of violence in response to blatant and covert white violence and oppression; recounts the beliefs of proponents of violence such as Malcolm X; and assesses the role of advocating violence and instances of committing it in the changes worked by the civil-rights movement. <br />	2005-03-29

Nothing is left out--from origins of and historical influences on Indian garb to materials and manufacture; from basic clothing to the variety of ornaments and accessories; from jewelry and bracelets to class and ethnic wear. The often exotic Indian clothing so noticeable to outsiders does not basically reflect the fashion tastes or personality of the wearer, but instead mainly denotes social station and sometimes occupation. As expected, the more sumptuous clothing and jewelry goes with those of higher class. But the typical clothing of farmers, laborers, and lower-class Indians is also colorful and elaborate in its own way. Rajasthan in northwestern India was chosen as the focus for this one-of-a-kind work because of its historical and cultural significance and the mix of different classes and ethnic groups found there. The Indian state's name is derived from Rajputs, or \\"sons of kings.\\" Bhandari's meticulous text is so fascinating and endlessly informative that one is hardly conscious of the exhaustive scholarship and research going into it. Often noting measurements, techniques used by the clothing makers, how an article is worn, and what is signifies, the text nonetheless does not strike one as being technical since it deals with such a colorful subject. Readers will fall into a pattern of looking at the attractive, rich color photographs and occasional illustrations and diagrams as they come, and then going to the text to find what interesting facts and points the author has on the items the men and women are wearing. Many readers will try to put their growing knowledge to work to guess social status of the individuals shown and the meanings of their accouterments. The descriptive captions should not be glossed over either. The color photo of one man notes that his \\"sword denotes his royal lineage, the silk tie [around it] signifying that it is carried in peace.\\" But one of the countless bits of social and cultural lore one learns is the significance of turbans in family relationships and relationships with others.

Groups of nude women sit around a long dinner table or stand in groups as if waiting for a bus. At first sight, except for their nudity, they look casual and normal. But longer viewing betrays a stiltedness, as if the women cannot get out of their subtle caricatures to communicate or touch one another in any genuine way. Other works are not so subtle on this central theme of the artificiality forced on most women in contemporary culture--such as the picture of a woman seemingly strapped to a hospital bed. The blank white, antiseptic, backgrounds of many of Beecroft's performance-like works and photographs emphasize the speciman-like quality and unreality of the figures in the foreground. Beecroft's similar group scenes with men in uniforms are ingenious counterpoints to the group scenes of nude women, while also making a point about masculine image. Snapshots and drawings having the rawness and tentativeness of experiments rather than the more complex imagery of the larger works nonetheless by their passive, somewhat anesthetized subjects, skewed angles, or provocative colors, affix aspects of Beecroft's main theme. Beecroft was born in Genoa in 1969. Showing major works along with a variety of lesser works, the book exhibits the distinctive art on contemporary preoccupations by which this artist has gained her much-deserved recognition. <br />	2005-03-01

Mostly, they represented \\"parental fears and sense of guilt\\" with regard to young children, including untimely deaths. In fact, where adult mythological figures were often related to a particular village or region, certain \\"child heroes...become Panhellenic figures at the center of some of the most important ancient religious festivals.\\" In this study methodically and extensively covering previously neglected and in some cases previously unknown ground, Pache adds new dimensions to Greek mythology and its relation to the psychology and outlooks of the Greek classical civilization that is one of the primary sources of Western culture. <br />	2005-03-01

With full-color pictures of Japanese woodcuts on nearly every page, it's really an art book on kabuki. One aspect of the woodcuts relating to the theater are woodcuts of actors. These testify to the important place of kabuki in Japanese society, while they sometimes served as a sort of publicity. Besides offering a multi-dimensional treatment covering origins and evolution, playwrights and actors, the yearly cycle of kabuki, costumes, staging, and music, the work is also a lifelong reference--with its six indexes for instance. The Dutch authors are steeped in the subject from extensive research and attraction to Japanese prints.

He died before the publication of this review of his short-lived but influential publishing company. Skywald's influence is seen today especially in the content and special effects in popular horror films. It's also seen, though not so clearly or directly, in how moods of fear and dread are created in many mainstream movies. Never straying from Hewetson's keen interest in exploring illustration for the horror genre, the Skywald periodicals had a lasting appeal only to its dyed-in-the-wool fans. For them, the Skywald comics with sensationalistic, macabre, imaginative illustrations developed what became known as its distinctive \\"horror-mood.\\" This review of the important publisher in the history of this genre contains articles on the horror-genre style of writing, its art, particular themes, interviews with Hewetson, and memoirs of him and Skywald. Alternating with these are 19 original illustrated stories effectively evoking Skywald's distinctive \\"horror-mood\\" and demonstrating its range of comic art. For fans of the horror genre and students of this vein of popular culture, the book \\"stands as a time capsule for an independent publishing house that had a true visionary [i. e., Alan Hewetson] at the reins.\\" <br />	2005-03-01

Y. Times on the most popular modern artists based on museum exhibitions, website hits, and other criteria placed Gerhard Richter third, closely behind Picasso and Warhol. So here is a catalogue raisonne documenting the art of this leading, popular contemporary artist over the past three decades. It is as much an art book on Richter as a work of complete documentation for reference. Most catalogues are similar to book bibliographies: They simply list all an artist's works over a period time with relevant notes. Often they picture some works, usually in black-and-white, sometimes with a few in color. But this comprehensive reference on Richter has more than 200 color photographs of his art works, nearly all of these one per page. The relevant annotations including measurements, medium, and background run alongside each of the pictured works. Additionally--again, unlike most catalogue raisonnes--this book has three essays by art experts on Richter's aesthetics and the various mediums he works in and techniques he uses. Richter's position as a popular and also influential contemporary artist is based on his imaginative and revealing treatment of images. This is a basic reference/art book for any private or public book collection on modern art. <br />	2005-03-01

To some, they might seem nihilistic in their austerity and spareness. The photographs are a series of leafless tree branches against a winter sky. But as Barth explains about her art work, she is not making a statement about nihilism; rather she is trying to evoke awareness of perception. The tree branches can be seen as neural networks. Perception can in some ways be compared with the process by which a camera makes a picture. The depth and relevance of the intended artistic interplay with Barth's photographs depend on sophisticated understandings of psychology and physiology along with keen abilities in introspection, conception, and articulation. They also depend to some degree on inventive understandings of psychology and physiology--which inventions this artist tries to bring to birth. <br />	2005-03-01

Involved in the war in Europe on all fronts including the Italian campaign, D-Day, and the invasion of Germany, the TDF always had an eclectic, ad hoc character to it. Faced with the seemingly incongruous requirements of greater mobility than the German tanks to find them and then outmaneuver them and at the same time powerful enough weapons to destroy the enemy tanks, the TDF made do with armed Jeeps, artillery, tanks, anti-tank mines and hand-placed explosives. The Force was filled with personnel with varied specialties and combat experience brought in from varied Army units. As important as the TDF was in taking out the deadly German tanks commonly threatening to stop advancing infantry, the Force was never smoothly integrated into the regular combat forces. It was disbanded shortly after World War II ended. Yeide is an author of a previous work on U. S. tank warfare in Europe whose history of this brief, but crucial Army tank force contains enough material on individual soldiers, tactics, and combat for any World War II and military history buff. What is new and most captivating about it, though, is the continuing innovation and scrappiness of the men of the Tank Destroyer Force as they gained more information about their foe, weapons evolved, and terrains and other conditions changed during the course of the War. <br />	2005-03-01

This desire was seen as far back as the Gilgamesh myth of the ancient Babylonians; and it emerged in American culture especially in Westward expansion and the related romance of the West. It entails a sense of wonder and the hope of encounter with the Sublime--elements undeniably evident in modern TV sci-fi, which are a major reason for their appeal. But imparting this sense of wonder and picturing the Sublime became possible only when TV technology improved from its first days. Only in recent years has TV arrived in an \\"era where far-seeing 'tele-vision' can finally live up to its name\\" by making use of \\"brilliant colors and dynamic motion\\" to enhance sf narratives. Today's TV science-fiction shows, notably \\"Star-Trek,\\" are contrasted with earlier ones such as \\"Twilight Zone\\" creating an atmosphere mainly by suggestion, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.

These are the stadiums built in cities around the country usually with some public funds and big tax breaks and other economic favors to the team owners. They are characterized by costly suites for corporate and well-to-do fans, rising ticket prices for all levels of regular seats from boxes to bleachers, moveable roofs and other features to provide comfort for the fans, and corporate logos lining the walls of the playing fields. Rosensweig is interested not only in how these stadiums promising revivals of urban centers come to be out of aspects of contemporary culture and political and economic interests; and also in the peculiar, particularly postmodern, notion of authenticity regarding baseball such stadiums are supposed to revive. In many cases, new businesses have sprung up around the new stadiums attempting to replicate neighborhoods that have been torn down to make way for them. Rosenweig's feelings on this phenomenon he covers are seen in the title of his introduction--\\"Cheap Grace.\\" The author did most of his research in Cleveland, where the Cleveland Indian's Jacobs Field was built as the anchor of the Gateway Developmental District. \\"The Gateway serves as a fascinating case study of the cultural shifts enacted by the transformation of a city's economic base from local commerce and manufacturing to recreational tourism.\\" Stadiums in other cities are brought in as well, notably the Baltimore Orioles' Camden Yards, the major urban stadium project giving rise to the others.

In a less experienced author's hands, such devices would make for a crazy quilt of a book. But with Chernozemsky, they serve to brings his ideas, vision, and interests into dramatic focus. <br />     These center around the main theme of the \\"various reincarnations of Christ and his coexistence with the Anti-Christ.\\" The benevolent, pacific, character Jesus Christ of the Bible is but one manifestation of the good in its eternal struggle with evil.

As the Preface notes, there has been much study on the Greek and Near Eastern influences on Etruscan culture, but not much on the influence of Etruscan culture on these--a deficit this work aims to make up for. In keeping with its goal, archaeological evidence in areas outside of ancient Etruria is examined for this Etruscan influence. This examination begins with the broad regions of the Mediterranean and Europe; then continue methodically through 14 specific areas in Italy, including the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. Most of these areas had Greek colonies. Many questions about Etruscan culture, especially its relationship to early Rome, have been at least partly answered in recent decades. This work of essays by Italian experts in the field and related visual matter takes Etruscan studies to the next level--namely, following the influence of Etruscan culture on a much wider area. As expected with this publisher connected with the Getty Museum, the book has the highest standards of production, design, and content. <br />	2005-01-26

But there is some material on the precedent of religious chanting in early and classical Mediterranean cultures, and also short sections on chanting in the world's other major religions. Gregorian chants getting their name from Pope Gregory of the late sixth century are regarded as the most mature development of Christian chanting. This Pope is \\"believed to be responsible for arranging the Gregorian chants which became the central pieces in religious services\\" with his historic reformation of Roman Catholic liturgy. Shearing puts the Gregorian chants in the context of the history of the Catholic Church, and discloses how spiritual and ecclesiastical concerns shaped them. Some technical, musicological, material on them is also included. This heavily illustrated relatively popular treatment of the chants is fortuitous considering their popularity on CDs, which takes them out of their religious context. The CD with this book contains 16 Gregorian chants. Shearing is a writer and lecturer who has traveled widely in pursuit of his spiritual interests. <br />	2005-01-26

The authors accept that the penchant for waging war is innate in human beings. This attribute was not engendered at some point in human evolution. The authors show that violence can be seen in archaeological findings of the earliest groups. The earliest violence was the use of techniques in hunting against other human beings. Human sacrifice, and possibly torture, can be seen in cave drawings. Even the development of agriculture and settled communities did not quell the penchant for violence, but in some ways carried it to the next level. The authors have no political or social agenda--they do not go into implications of their well-substantiated postulate that warfare is derived from inherent characteristics of human beings. Zammit is a doctor and paleopathologist whose knowledge of these fields brings a special insight into signs of violence on human remains and psychology and behavior which are the sources of war and go into war when it breaks out. Guilaine's fields are archeology and social science; which allow him to offer unfamiliar, yet plainly pertinent and unassailable disclosures about societies' penchants for war. With their different perspectives, the co-authors hone in on the core human characteristics accounting for the constancy of war in culture. <br />	2005-01-26

She came to the U. S. in 1920 from Japan hoping to find a better life for herself. But in the 1940s, along with tens of thousands of other Japanese-Americans, she was put into a detention camp. After the war, she worked in dress factories after her husband died. The constant changes in her life never gave her the opportunity to pursue her artistic ambitions beyond some brief education in her early years in the U. S. But she picked up enough to paint oil paintings in a bright, bold, somewhat cubist style. Many of these offer views of the detention camps she was held at. Hibi was also an observant, competent writer of English who kept a journal, lengthy passages of which are also included. This Issei woman's daughter has also added photographs to this commemoration of her mother's life which typifies the experiences of Japanese on the West coast during World War II. At the same time, it draws a memorable portrait of this woman who recorded in pictures and words historical and personal incidents in her quiet, determined, accomplished way. <br />	2005-01-26

Volumes Two and Three of this series by other authors deal with different stages of this Egyptian Christian Church. This first clearly definable period of this volume laid the grounds for the survival of the Coptic Church down to today even though with the coming of Islam, it was marginalized and its members often discriminated against. In many ways, the study of the Coptic papacy resembles the study of the Catholic papacy and the first years of the Catholic Church. There were similar decisions important in establishing the Coptic Church; the personalities of the early Coptic popes were especially important in creating the internal nature and public image of the Church; and there were theological controversies over basic doctrines and beliefs. \\"Apostolicity, martyrdom, monastic patronage, and theological resistance\\" are the four major themes during this formative period for the Coptic Church. \\"The Early Coptic Papacy\\" along with the companion volumes substantiates the Coptic Church as a subject in religious studies with its own history worthy of study. <br />	2005-01-26

For Hurley, nature draws out reflections on God's Creation and one's place in the greater scheme of things. But Hurley does not only look beyond himself to see a grandeur nature is the threshold for; he also looks inward to explore how his attachment to nature shaped him throughout his life and instilled in him an sense of closeness to others. \\"Through these essays I wanted to express to [readers] something of the hidden, eternal meaning of the wilderness through my experiences of it as a child and later as a husband and father.\\" The 33 essays are collected from the author's periodical \\"Paddle & Portage\\" which was discontinued when he turned his attention to his law business to support his growing family.

By his own experiences as an emigre from Europe threatened by Nazism and his philosophical interests growing out of them, he had a unique, and fertile, understanding of modernism's yearning for new, enriching dimensions of spirituality and for reliable, meaningful stability behind the era's new forms of politics such as Nazism and Communism and the delusions and conceits of modern individuals. Voegelin makes trenchant criticisms of these and other radical, misguided modernist creeds and styles. Gnosticism as arising in the modern era is one aberrant attempt to gain heightened spirituality he criticized especially. A philosopher, not a political scientist or social critic, Voegelin only rarely refers directly to specific errors and evils of modern culture. But one familiar with the contests of the modern world continuing into this day understands those which his work grapples with. The editors, both with Louisiana universities, collect five articles relating Voegelin's voluminous writings with other major late 19th-century and 20th-century philosophers and thinkers. The names Nietzsche, Ricoeur, Deleuze, and Husserl crop up in different essays. Classical sources of Voegelin's extensive works based on a few simple precepts are also discussed. The essays are rounded out with introductory and closing sections by the editors which provide biographical information on Voegelin andput the project of the book into perspective. The collected academic philosophical articles demonstrate the continuing relevance of Voegelin's thinking on the main, though often elusive, issues of modern culture, politics, and individual lives while also serving as an introduction to this philosopher whose influence continues to grow. <br />	2005-01-26

No one would argue with this. But Grant is concerned with more than expounding why this was the golden age. He is also concerned with what happened in Broadway and the general culture toward the end of the 1960s to bring this golden age to an end. He finds his answers in both technological and social changes which practically everyone is aware of, but which readers would not look to as reasons for the decline of such musicals. The spread of electronic music changed what audiences became accustomed to. Rock and other popular music ruined an appreciation for the brightness, simplicity, and style of the type of music and songs of the classical Broadway musical. Along with this, changing tastes in entertainment favored special effects, dancing, and often celebrities as actors over fetching scores and memorable melodies. \\"Director-Choreographers Co-opted a Writer's Medium\\" is how Grant puts it. The factors Grant sees as responsible for the decline in the quality--if not always the box office receipts--of Broadway musicals at their best is evident in the way Broadway musicals are advertised and marketed today. The author is a composer and writer who had done concert music and theater pieces performed in the U. S. and Europe. His previous book is \\"Pen: A History of Classical Music Criticism in America.\\" This is a work combining literary and artistic criticism and history with cultural studies on one of the most characteristic American popular art forms. <br />	2005-01-26

He makes no attempt to popularize the Druids, as has been done by so many recent authors of New Age bent singling out the Druids as exemplary models of nature worship. Today, the Druids are popularly identified with ancient Ireland, adding to their mystique by the suggestion that their spirituality remained pure by being so distant from continental Europe and apart from the British Isles. But Kendrick is not swayed at all by popular beliefs or even more solid presumptions about the Druids found among some scholars. \\"It seems likely, however, that the druidic caste in Ireland was never anything but a very faint reflection of the Gallic system, and one that speedily became isolated and degenerate.\\" In discussing the subjects of Druidic religion and their temples, including the intriguing stone monuments found in England and also places in Europe, he stays in touch with the archaeological evidence complemented by surviving written documents. In trying to answer the question about the pacific nature of a society figuring into the origins of the Druids, he points out that farming tools found in ancient burial sites far outnumber weapons. But he also notes that this is not conclusive, and makes the point that the proportion changes if one regards a certain kind of ax as a weapon. Kendrick's main purpose for the book was \\"to provide a complete and well-documented summary of the whole of the pertinent material upon which a study of this subject should be properly based.\\" Kendrick's achievement, then, is to lay out the grounds for study of the Druids, not search doggedly for any conclusions or paint a picture rooted in his own spiritual yearnings and romanticism. The author lays this ground out in the broad topicareas of Tradition, Prehistory, History, Religion, Temples, and Origins, with an appendix of passages from Greek and Roman texts in their original languages. Other  passages from Greek and Roman writings are quoted in English in the main text. Fifty-one illustrations and maps are mixed in with the chapters. No matter what one's beliefs about the Druids, Kendrick's wide-ranging, authoritative study is a fascinating study of ancient European culture and history. <br />	2005-01-26

Not that there aren't some dark moments: Roy Roger's first wife died; and three of the couple's nine children died. But while the sorrows of such moments are not overlooked, it is the strength of Roy and Dale which comes shining through, as when dealing with culprits or problems in their films. The popular, largely pictorial biography contains a number of heretofore unpublished family photos. Fans of these stars of early TV and aficionados of popular culture will take to this book. While not undermining or even threatening the fond popular image of the couple, it presents them as not just stars, but ones who had a life outside of the limelight as well. <br />	2005-01-26

This multidisciplinary work aims to inform readers of perspectives and realities regarding contemporary Christianity not reflected or suggested in the popular media. Focus on certain anomalies is especially revealing, as well as to some degree predictive of Christianity's possible future depending on how these are resolved. Kevin Ward, a lecturer of Church issues in the modern world, explores how the \\"fragmentation and religious pluralism\\" in postmodernism not only limit and distort understanding of beliefs and developments in Christianity, but also shape strategies for Christians wishing to be a part of modern culture. \\"Believing Without Belonging\\" is part of the title of Ward's article. Another by Bruce Knox, Executive Director of Bible College in New Zealand, explores the apparent anomaly that \\"Christian Allegiance Is Declining, Yet Theological Education Is Booming.\\" The role of religion in shaping the New Zealand national identity, even as the nation was \\"set up more or less decisively independent of any denominational church influence,\\" is another relevant topic; while a couple of other articles take up political solutions for dealing with the desire of Christians to see their beliefs and values reflected more plainly in government policies and activity. The number of articles by theologians, historians, and sociologists, among others, with their fingers on the pulse of contemporary Christian situations and concerns offer a variety of views on the persistent matter of religion in contemporary life and current affairs. <br />	2005-01-26

This coffee-table quality book with the title \\"Collecting Japanese Antiques\\" is a survey of Japanese art works and cultural items with sections of advice for collectors. The historical and cultural background on the different items favors what would be of interest to collectors. But it is also informative and relevant simply for its artistic, historical, and cultural material. Readers looking for concentrated information on Japanese art and culture accompanied by attractive color photographs would find this work exceptionally suitable. For the collectors it is meant for particularly, there's sections on \\"Tides and Trends in Collecting,\\" guidance in developing collections of certain items (e. g., baskets), lists of artists, notable regions and schools for certain antiques, and especially desirable objects in certain categories. Seton also moves to the technical subjects of materials, production, and workmanship which are important for collectors not only in appreciating items and assessing their value, but in making a preliminary decision about their age and authenticity. Among Seton's 13 categories of antiques are screens and scrolls, ceramics, furniture, sculpture and metalwork, dolls, and tea ceremony utensils. Seton has lived in Japan since 1972, where he currently teaches Japanese art and poetry. In 1993, he founded the quarterly magazine \\"Daruma\\" to cover Japanese art and antiques; which he still edits. \\"Collecting Japanese Antiques\\" is a work any collector or lover of Japanese art and antique objects will want for sound education and easy reference, and at times for enjoyably looking at the numerous color photos of the varied Japanese objects. <br />	2005-01-26

The authors' note right at the start of this encyclopedic work for art historians, conservators, and forensic specialists cites historic complaints that the names artists have recorded for the pigments they used in their paintings, frescoes, etc., are notoriously unreliable. Hence, the hundreds of cross-references to help researchers get to the pigment an artist used in a work despite what he or she may have called it. The reference also works from the standpoint of wishing to confirm a particular pigment by describing in detail its physical and chemical properties. This incomparable art reference for determining important matters of works of art goes beyond such scientific information to include as well historical notes on many of the pigments. The entry \\"Burnt Ochre\\" is an example of most of the thousands of entries: It begins with the general comment that the \\"phenomena that yellow ochre when heated converts to red ochre\\" has been known since pre-historic times. This is followed by a note that the fourth-century B. C. philosopher Theophrastus wrote a detailed description of the process of \\"producing burnt ochres.\\" Then comes the physical and chemical information--\\"The process in action is the thermal transformation of goethite...to iron(III) oxide, whereby the goethite begins to dehydrate...,\\" and so on for about 20 more lines. (The chemical equations in the quote are omitted in this review.) After this comes a few short paragraphs on comments later writers have made on burnt ochre, with the entry ending with remarks on the term for this pigment and related terms. The \\"Pigment Compendium\\" is an exhaustive, reliable guide to resolving important matters about works of art using pigments--matters which may involve accurate dating, and in some cases also involve large sums of money for museums or private collectors. Every museum, art library, and serious art collector should have a copy. <br />	2005-01-26

They do so through biographical and historical studies of key French proconsuls in French colonies in Africa and Asia. They do not try to make the simplistic point that French imperialism and colonialism was good, or even desirable. But they aim to balance the picture of this colonialism, and by extension all Western colonialism. While not trying to gloss over brutalities and atrocities committed by colonial masters, the authors note that colonialism also worked to \\"reduce feudal inequalities, abolish serfdom, establish constitutions, build roads...and extend educational opportunities.\\" This was seen by France--and other colonial powers--as \\"civilizing backward peoples.\\" But it could also be seen as raising the living standards of the inhabitants of the colonies. Shedding a light on French colonialism by biographically and analytically looking at the specific colonial officials of Thomas Robert Bugeaud of Algeria, Louis-Hubert-Gonzalve Lyautey of Southeast Asia, and others, the authors inject a human dimension, with all of its aspirations and faults, into the subject. This is a scholarly work which reads almost like history for the general reader for dealing with historical characters and seeing historical issues in terms of their personalities and actions. With its balanced, broader view of French colonialism, \\"Cultured Force\\" restores an ambiguity to its subject, thus making it a subject of true history and human enterprise rather than an ideological or myopic one.	2005-01-26

For example, there was also a \\"war pipe.\\". But the place of pipes in pre-Columbian and later Native American culture goes far beyond this as well. \\"\\"First, it must be kept in mind that smoking pipes are essentially drug delivery devices and that smoking instills varying degrees of altered consciousness.\\" In \\"no way utilitarian,\\" pipes are thus distinguished from other aboriginal artifacts; and from this way they are distinguished, they uniquely shed light on dimensions of spirituality, shamanistic practices, tribal social activities, inter-tribal relationships, and the history and movement of tribes. As seen by some of the latter essays, these social and anthropological matters relating to pipes found their way into different ethnic and regional groups of Europeans settling in eastern North America who adopted pipe smoking. Native American pipes were made of stone or wood; had different shapes; and sometimes included effigies of animals. All of these differences concern different purposes and occasions, or tell something about the history of the group respective pipes were related to. Rafferty is an associate professor of anthropology at SUNY-Albany; Mann is an archaeologist in Louisiana. Photographs, maps, and tables go with the text in this fetching subject. <br />	2004-12-25

Nonetheless, Cheng makes the voluminous bibliography as useful as possible for English readers while remaining faithful to the original Chinese names for the entries. Besides the Chinese characters, the Chinese titles are romanized, i. e., written as they would be spoken in Chinese by Westerners. Also, a closing \\"note\\" with nearly every one of the Chinese entries denotes the general contents of the publication. English, European, and other Asian publications make up a small percentage of the listings. The nine main sections are Reference Materials, Film History, Specific Film Genres, Film Reviews, Film Theory and Technique, Interdisciplinary Studies, Screenplays and Scripts, Film Technology, and lastly Film Directors, Producers, Actors, Actresses, Cinematographers, Critics, and Screenplay Writers. With each entry in these all-encompassing categories are \\"entry number, author, title, publication, ISBN, series title note, and language code.\\" The three indexes of subject, author, and title are also helpful to English-speaking students of Chinese film. This first volume of Cheng's ambitious, timely reference \\"covers materials--including monographs, conference proceedings, and theses--that relate to film studies in and about mainland China published between 1920-2003.\\" A forthcoming second volume will record materials relating to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Like Indian films, Chinese films are attracting considerable critical and audience interest in the U. S. This reference is an incomparable guide to the history and breadth of Chinese film studies, Chinese film production, and Chinese actors and filmmakers. <br />	2004-12-25

A Professor in the Department of Theatre, Film, and Television Studies at the U. of Glascow, Bottoms sees the connection between this \\"off-off-Broadway\\" theater of the tumultuous and quixotic 1960s and today's popular entertainment. The raucousness of rock concerts, the brazenness of Janet Jackson's \\"wardrobe malfunction,\\" the provocative live performances, and rap lyrics all had precursors in the \\"illegitimate\\" theater of the 60s. Bottom's engaging work is both historical and critical. He cites the artistic and cultural sources while also bringing in the wider social milieu of the time. General themes and developments share space with activities and individuals connected with particular theaters and troupes. \\"Playing Underground\\" is a benchmark work of thorough research which goes into the social and political agendas of this theater scene while at the same time imparting its unconventional, often deliberately provocative and obscene, and in the long run, influential performance style. <br />	2004-12-25

But Hughes, author of previous books on lesser-known aspects and figures of the Confederate military, demonstrates these qualities of Bell by detailing activities such a troop placements, probing maneuvers, assaults and defenses, terrain, and the involvement of key officers of the opposing sides in numerous engagements of all sizes Bell was involved in. Bell was active mostly in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi. The biography has a personal touch concerning Bell with the participation of Moretti and Browne, descendants of his. The journeyman military biography not only establishes the place of Bell in the military activities of the Confederacy in an area of its western theater, but is also an account of the conflict in this area. <br />	2004-12-25

But counting for nearly the entire population of Iran and 60 percent of Iraq's, the Shi'i have a crucial influence on Middle East and world affairs from their numbers in these strategically important countries. A professor of Islamic and Iranian history at the U. of Texas-Austin, Aghaie gives a view of Shi'i culture in Iran that is eye-opening and germane for Western readers. Basically, one sees that for the Shi'i there is no clear, or even worthwhile, distinction between religion and other aspects of society, including most significantly government. Whereas such a distinction is a part of the foundation of the U. S. and other democracies, Shi'i culture was founded with the defeat of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Hoseyn and the massacre of his family by the caliph Yazidin in the 680AD battle of Karbala. Shi'i religious ceremonies, motives for behavior, social purposes, and community goals grew out of this defeat. A special intensity and commitment, as well as sacrifice, was called for so Islam as expressed by Mohammad and his descendants would not be lost. This branch of Islam faith is distinguished from that reflected in the institutional rule of the caliphs came about throughout most of the Middle East. Aghaie's subject is the relationship between Iranian leaders from the Qajars of the 19th and early 20th century through the Shah of Iran to today's Islamic Republic and the symbols and rituals of Shiism. The Shah of Iran was overturned in a revolution because in an effort to modernize Iran, he sought to minimize the symbols and rituals. The work brings an insight into the Shi'i culture that is timely and germane considering current events in Iran and Iraq and U. S. ambitions to institute democracy in this area. <br />	2004-12-25

Oleg's unexplained loss of his father in World War II is the experience everything centers on; as similarly, Russia has been abruptly cut off from its historical and ideological pasts. Both Oleg and Russia find themselves in a new world with little from the past to guide them. Oleg takes to art. He becomes an exceptional violin player who travels the world, living in San Francisco after a while. But his art, no matter how much he puts into it and how successful he is with it, does not bring a complete satisfaction to him. Rather, because of it, he is drawn back to Russia, the source of the sense of loss he cannot overcome. This underlies the main character's situation. But Druzhnikov does not dwell on it in a heavy way. Oleg is a bright, energetic, hopeful character whose attempts to bring past and present together are dealt with in a spirited and often comic way. Dialogue is occasionally zany, characters eccentric, and Oleg's thoughts ad observations clever and witty. Author Druzhnikov is a best-selling Russian author who has gained international notice and is currently a Professor of Russian Literature at the U. of California-Davis. <br />	2004-12-25

The rest is art history. This voluminous, multi-dimensional biography follows the trajectory of the life of this leading 20th-century artist from impoverished immigrant through Greenwich Village libertine and rising artist to his move to Long Island and his position at the pinnacle of the art world and eventual dementia-afflicted decline in his last years. Relating de Kooning's friendships with other artists, relationships with women, course in the lively, avant-garde New York City art world of mid-century, the development of his artistry, and his lasting influence on modern art, the biography reflects not only all facets of the artist's life, but also the art scene and a good deal of the society of the period. And it offers vignettes of many notable artists, critics, art gallery owners, and such. With regular quotes from de Kooning's writings and other documents, photographs of him at different times of his life and at work, and illustrations of works of art, including a 16-page section of works in color, Stevens and Swan's book imparts an incomparable, memorable picture of de Kooning.

But there's more to this retrospective than the sensationalistic covers for enthusiasts of popular culture and paperback book collectors. An inside view of the \\"sleaze paperback\\" industry of the time is recounted in essays by four writers; one of whom spent some time in jail for peddling [...]. Passages from some of the books illustrate the genre's elliptical, yet unmistakable style for dealing with the sexual subjects and scenes so the books could get by the [...] censorship. The hundreds of paperbacks identified by their covers with author, publisher, and artist in the caption are divided into main categories appealing to readers of different backgrounds and sexual fantasies. \\"Sick Suburb,\\" \\"Butch Swish,\\" and \\"Sin Revue\\" are some of these. Another feature beyond the pictures is 15 interviews with writers in the field. A listing of the publishers, an index of pseudonyms used by most of the writers working in the genre, and a second index of the authors real names followed by their pseudonyms are found in the back matter. All in all, a copious collection of a vein of book cover art which also has material on the genre as an area of popular culture flourishing in the 1960s and influencing the culture's regard of sexual matter and treatment of it in following decades.	2004-12-25

But using ideas from feminist literary criticism, Kassanoff finds in Wharton's characters, circumstances, and story lines racial concerns of the comfortable white urban society of the early 1900s. Mixed in with Wharton's wry, sometimes jaundiced, picture of the self-satisfied upper-level white society are \\"a host of early twentieth-century white patrician anxieties [about race].\\" This anxiety was not aroused by blacks only. It was broader than garden-variety racial prejudice; and vague and protean, as an anxiety would be. Wharton's characters are uneasy about all foreigners, or immigrants, and the growth in the population of the lower classes. They uneasily sensed their own \\"race suicide\\" if they could not come up with a means to preserve their own position. Kassanoff explores the various artful ways explicit, subtle, and ambiguous that Wharton recurringly expresses such anxieties in her works. While concentrating on Wharton's writings, the author occasionally makes references to politicians, social scientists, and the like of the period to illuminate Wharton's sources and motives. Kassanoff sees that in the end Wharton was not despairing nor contemptuous of democratic society, whatever changes it might bring; but became convinced in her long artistic jousting with the racial anxieties of her peers \\"that in democracy's inclusiveness lay the promise of America's future.\\" The author of this enlightening critique of Wharton that has aspects of a cultural study while being mainly a literary critique is an associate professor of English at Barnard College. <br />	2004-12-25

In between these years, the historically closely tied cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul grew from a \\"collection of huts and shanties\\" to a major national and international center of commerce. With the phone system, up-to-date plumbing, and electricity the cities brought in in the latter 1800s, they began to more and more resemble other major American cities. Wills meticulously follows the rapid growth of the two cities by focusing on the activity of the most important individuals in the area of commerce and the economy. She is methodical and complete in describing their outsized activities and the results of these, for the most part passing over their personalities and personal lives. Even the author's notes over 40 pages are worth going through for the facts and comments found in many. Wills is an assistant professor of history at Brooklyn College, CUNY. What her book lacks in color, it more than makes up for in substance and thoroughness. It's the fundamental economic history on Minneapolis and St. Paul in the middle decades of the 19th century. <br />	2004-12-25

Cozzens does not go much into practical or administrative recommendations for responding to the calls by lay persons for changes in the Catholic Church. He writes about the appropriateness and desirability of the ideas and role lay persons are calling for. Such lay persons appear more than any others to be affected by the scandalous behavior of many priests and concerned about the future of the Catholic Church and the spirituality it professes to embody.

And as in our own day, this was tied in with the curiosity and voyeurism of the public for sensationalistic stories about crimes, celebrities, politicians, royalty and other public figures, including their scandalous sexual improprieties. Such stories found their way into public entertainment as well, primarily the stage. Diamond does not so much critique the Victorian press and stage, but goes into the cultural milieu for the stories and describes how they were treated in the press and in some cases on stage. In doing so, he brings the perspective of contemporary media studies and cultural studies to his varied subjects. \\"Dickens' 'Oliver Twist'...would have been called a 'sensational novel', had the term existed then.\\" If the names of the persons in the stories and their dates were changed, one would hardly be able to distinguish them from ones found in today's media.

Pool, a graduate of Harvard, is a writer and English teacher. The episode took place in the Baltic Sea. Jacobs' account moves smoothly from experiences of him and his brother, including their separation and eventual reunion, to the larger picture of how the Jews from the camps came to be on the boats, were caught between the desperate Germans and the advancing British Armies (with the possibility the Germans meant to sink the boats once they were at sea), and British Royal Air Force operations and decisions which led to the bombing of the ships and deaths of more than 7,000 persons. Jacobs and Pool lean toward the position that the \\"R. A. F. sacrificed the prisoners\\" in its effort to prevent German officials from escaping by sea to Denmark or Sweden. The authors see the British government's sealing of records relating to the episode until 2045 as lending support to this deduction. This tragic WWII episode is not unknown, and questions about it have been previously raised. But these two authors give the most thorough account of it. Jacob's first-hand experiences and the authors' inspection of the limited official and historical records which are available make this work stand out. <br />	2004-11-29

Mayeski, a professor of historical theology at Loyola Marymount U. in Los Angeles, studies biographies of the three written by contemporaries of theirs for a comprehension of the relationship between the theological thoughts and teachings of the women saints and theological issues concerning the Catholic Church during their lifetimes. As the author finds, it is significant not only that the women were chosen as subjects by leading biographers of their age. But individuals were chosen for biographies because of their value in reinforcing the position of the Church and elucidating its doctrines. The biographies of the medieval women saints were meant to be instructive on theological matters and religious virtues. But while the women patently made a significant impression on their contemporaries, their theological contributions were not recognized in following eras of Church growth and theological development. By examining original biographical and historical sources, Mayeski persuasively makes the point that the three women theologians stood out as spiritual leaders to their contemporaries; and thus there was a greater feminine influence on the Church in its early period than is ordinarily recognized or acknowledged. <br />	2004-11-29

Each of the monthly maps identifies Union and Confederate positions and respective troop and cavalry movements and naval movements; clashes of all sizes, including notable skirmishes; and the front lines over the large area as these shifted month-by-month throughout the War. Thus, one can readily follow the overall strategies and activities of each side, as well as developments in particular areas. On left-hand pages facing the full-page maps are details relating to what is identified in the maps. For example, the partisan disturbance in Alabama signified in the August 1863 map is noted as \\"a band of deserters known as 'Jim Ward's Raiders' [operating] out of the Pea River Swamp south of Elba.\\" In relation to the map for September 1863, the annotation for North Carolina cites that Longstreet's soldiers passing through Raleigh sacked the offices of the pro-Union, pro-peace newspaper the \\"Standard.\\" Besides following the War with the succession of maps, the Civil War buff and military historian also learns many little-known incidents and circumstances from the annotations. Several secondary maps after the main ones record military activities in the Southwest, including the lower half of California and the western part of the Texas. The large-size reference is an ideal accompaniment to any book, movie, TV program, newspaper article, etc. on the Civil War to put its subject in context. And it also stands on its own as a clear, engaging overview of the Civil War. <br />	2004-11-29

The dreams carry over into his waking life, so that the line between dreaming and reality becomes blurred. He seeks help for this from the psychologist Dr. Marcus Delany; who tells Richard \\"lucid dreaming\\" is the professional terminology for his disturbing experiences, even though Delany is not able to cure him of them.

It's not enough simply to advertise for job openings, but the technical work has to be properly described to attract the right kind of prospective employees. Otherwise, the hiring process will be inefficient, murky, and errant. Reviewing resumes, screening potential candidates for interviews and preparing for these, and conducting an interview are other topics. A consultant to technical firms, Rothman also goes into a personal touch with individuals looking for employment which gives them a favorable impression of the company. This is desirable because a company might want to hire an applicant at a future time; and it creates a favorable image of the company among technical workers. This specialized hiring manual is timely considering the present pick-up in activity in the technology sector of the economy. Many technology companies have to start now preparing to hire new technical workers to be able to capitalize on the opportunities shaping up. <br />	2004-11-29

The architect chosen for this unprecedented, highly-visible, and risky large-scale architectural undertaking was William Welles Bosworth, a MIT graduate in architecture recommended by John D. Rockefeller. Yet, Bosworth continually had to reckon with the influence of other prominent architects who had put forth their own visionary plans. Among these were Ralph Adams Cram, who had designed West Point's campus; Steven Child, a student of Frederick Law Olmstead; and the chairman of MIT's Dept. of Architecture, Desire Despradelle. Jarzombek tells the story of how Bosworth managed to remain true to his own plans rooted in his neoclassicism while accommodating the ideas of other architects and the preferences of the powerful patrons. This complex, historic project is followed with plentiful old photographs and architectural drawings from MIT's archives. The author, a professor in MIT's Dept. of Architecture, gives equal treatment to the diverse individuals who had a role in the shaping of the project, the architectural concepts of the time, and Bosworth's work and resolutions of issues along the way. Needless to say, the architectural project succeeded in putting MIT into the forefront of U. S. science and engineering universities. And Bosworth's cluster of impressive buildings continues to play a central role in MIT's staying in this position. <br />	2004-11-29

S. respond to the editor Boles proposition that they write essays on the relationship between their earlier lives and their eventual work as historians. As Boles put it in his letter to them, he was asking them to \\"think autobiographically and ponder what in your background and life experiences helped determine you to become a historian of the South.\\" Material could embrace education, mentors, decisions, and successes and rejections. Boles is a history professor at Rice U. and managing editor of the \\"Journal of Southern History.\\" The fifteen historians responded openly and thoughtfully. The essays are engaging for their personal tones as well as how the work of any historian is prompted and molded by his or her penchants, experiences, and mentors and associates. Drew Faust, from Harvard, begins his essay \\"Living History,\\" with, \\"We create ourselves out of the stories we tell about our lives....\\" Pete Daniel, on the other hand, in \\"Accidental Historian,\\" begins, \\"Nothing in my family suggested that I would become a historian.\\" The varied personal paths into the discipline evidence why history is so informative and germane.

The author evokes an understanding of Art Deco not mainly by discussion of aesthetics or art criticism, but by immersion in the spirit of the time between the World Wars, frequently with bountiful and in many cases, unfamiliar visual matter. The Empire State Building and Paul Manship's sculpture of Prometheus ringed by signs of the zodiac in Rockefeller Center are familiar Art Deco images, if often taken for granted. But designs of rooms, architectural details of buildings, trains and cars, and magazine covers and clothing fashion are often overlooked. Garrard demonstrates how deeply--thoroughly--Art Deco pervaded the culture; and points to elements of this vibrant, short-lived cultural period which continue. <br />	2004-11-29

Each of the listings of the hundreds of Japanese plants gives notes on appearance, cultivation, and use (e. g., ground cover, attractive spring flowers, potted plant) of the particular plant along with the Japanese and English names, interesting points, and related plants. As noted in the Foreword by E. Charles Nelson, the Japanese, with their insular culture, had no desire to go abroad seeking foreign plants--nor did they need to with the variety available in their homeland. Yet American gardeners and others readily took to Japanese plants when Japan opened up to the West, and continue to do so increasingly in recent years. This attractive, complete, useful reference fully satisfies an interest in the variety of Japanese plants. Both authors have extensive backgrounds and solid reputations in horticulture. <br />	2004-11-29

This society was basically hierarchical and aristocratic. Today's conventional conception of a castle as more or less a fortification is a largely romantic notion bearing little relation to the true place of castles in medieval society. In medieval Europe, towns, ecclesiastical areas, estates and mansions, and even temporary earthworks of a traveling army were regarded as castles. The word \\"fortalicium\\" originally used for \\"castle\\" meant \\"element\\" or \\"sign\\" of fortification more than strictly a military fortification. In the medieval society, this was understood to mean above all \\"a symbolism of aristocratic armed power.\\" As symbols of this power, castles were also social centers where most of the interaction of the different social classes took place. As Coulson remarks, there is no military history associated with most castles. In his revision of the conception of castles, the author elaborates on the presence of high-rankng women in many of them. Coulson is a research fellow at England's U. of Kent. He does not undercut the significance of castles in medieval society; rather, he shifts the understanding of what their significance was. <br />	2004-10-28

Goldsmith: A Life in Watercolor	Books	5	25	26	N	N	overview of watercolotist's life and paintings	Goldsmith has been painting his watercolors since he graduated from Yale in the 1930s after studying under the noted watercolorist Eliot O'Hara. His travels to the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia after graduation infused his characteristic paintings done mostly in Maine and Vermont with a use of color both deft and delicate and an almost calligraphic sense of line and organization. Carl Little's title \\"Passion of Place\\" for his Introduction refers especially to Goldsmith's use of color. As Little notes, Goldsmith's paintings are essentially evocative rather than representational even though scenes are recognizable in them. Drawn early in his career to Turner's watercolor sketches, Goldsmith himself allows this. Winslow Homer and Andrew Wyeth are other detectable, but indirect influences. All but a few of the 62 full-page, full-color plates were done after 1990, Goldsmith's mature period when his distinctive, absorbing style was fully developed. <br />	2004-10-28

As with many objects and activities in Japanese society, the koto and the playing of it have been used to signify the social class and certain social situations. Varied individuals such as aristocrats, blind male professionals, and female amateurs indicated their status by how they played the instrument. An ethnomusicologist at the U. of Otago in New Zealand, Johnson ranges through the construction and design of the koto, music for it and the performance of this, the koto's place in Japanese culture, and changes in these as Japanese society has changed.

S. incursions into Mexico led by General John Pershing had become so tense that the \\"situation was not dissimilar to that of Jewish settlers in the West Bank\\"; with the small number of white Texans along the border being compared to the Jewish settlers surrounded by a much greater number of resentful Palestinians. In this situation, the Texas governors of this decade--Colquitt, Ferguson, and Hobby--used the Texas Rangers to protect Texas citizens and combat the tactics of Mexicans directed by Carranza and in some cases acting as vigilantes. The unique and in ways controversial activities of the Texas Rangers in this complex, volatile, and fluid situation is the subject the authors hone in on. Harris and Sadler, both former professors at New Mexico State U., bring to light little-known dimensions of the historical events, which continue to affect relationships and feelings between the white Texans and Hispanics in the area. There was much lawlessness on both sides. Mexican Army troops dressed as civilians crossed the border to raid Texas communities. After Texas Rangers executed two Mexican agitators after taking them by force from the F.B.I., the U. S. Attorney General issued an order that all prisoners henceforth be held by the U. S. Army. The situation was especially complicated not only because of points of opposition between Texas and the U. S. Federal Government, but also because of Mexican president Carranza's desire for recognition by the U. S. while trying at the same time to stand up to it. While concentrating on the unique role of the Rangers in this complex historical situation, Harris and Sadler also construct the context in which their activities took place. <br />	2004-10-28

The books have exceptional value not only for their scarcity, but because of the publisher's historical significance in this genre. Arkham House was started in 1937 by the writer August Derleth to publish the works of his friend H. P. Lovecraft who had recently died. With the success of this first venture, the House took on other authors, among them Lord Dunsany and Robert Howard. In 1947, it published Ray Bradbury's first book, \\"Dark Carnival.\\" After introductory general material on the collecting, buying, and selling of Arkham House books, there are annotated bibliographies of every book published by Arkham as well as its two imprints, Mycroft & Moran, and Stanton & Lee. The detailed annotations identify the contents of the respective book and point out bits of information important to collectors; and they end with current prices for first printings of first editions of the book in its best condition with a jacket and without a jacket. But that's not all--following the three comprehensive bibliographies are sections on the 35 most valuable Arkham House books; its books ranked by scarcity; and a listing of the publisher's catalogs, which are also of interest to collectors, though not nearly so valuable as the books, the most desirable of which can cost a couple of thousand dollars. Nielsen is himself a collector of Arkham House books.

Ouspensky: The Genius in the Shadow of Gurdjieff	Books	5	7	12	N	N	biography and new perspective on Ouspensky	Partly a biography of Ouspensky and partly an examination of the similarities and differences in his spiritual beliefs and those of his mentor Gurdjieff, Lachman's work basically searches for the reasons for or causes of the eventual estrangement between these two spiritual leaders of the early twentieth century. Lachman places them in the company of Madame Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and Aleister Crowley. Ouspensky and Gurdjieff first met in Moscow; their lives were disrupted by the Russian Revolution; and both eventually ended up in London. Gurdjieff has the claims to greater fame and influence in the areas of the occult and mysticism. Although Lackman does not completely dismiss the bases for Gurdjieff's higher reputation, he does bring light to Ouspensky's originality, independence, and influence. Gurjieff's higher standing in relation Ouspensky is seen as a result of his craftiness, which is a type of worldliness whereby he managed his image to try to make for an assured and favorable legacy. While the relative stature of each in this vein of modern spirituality can finally be only opinion, in his search to establish such stature, Lachman opens up many dimensions of the modern-day spirituality espoused by these two, both of whom were undeniably influential. Lachman has written two previous books and has appeared on BBC programs on topics related to his writings of social critique and modern spirituality. <br />	2004-10-28

Recognizing that the sources and causes of pedophilia are too little understood for any cure to be much more than a somewhat arbitrary, hopeful exercise, the editors and authors of this volume of the publisher's Forensic Psychotherapy Monograph Series attempt to answer the questions \\"where to these urges come from?\\", and \\"what purpose do they serve?\\" for the pedophile. In the articles with references to individual pedophiles, clinical studies, sexual abuse suffered by pedophiles themselves, and the relationship of adolescent experiences and homosexuality to pedophilia, the psychiatrists shed much light on the murky origins and the playing out of pedophilia. With the bulk of its content on the psychology and behavior of pedophiles rather than clinical data, the collected articles are of interest to many lay readers. <br />	2004-09-28

Rather, Mitchell uses the diverse, interesting antiquities as direct or related references to the historical periods covered in the long time span of the Bible and the cultures of the different lands and civilizations which are parts of its tales. The photographs of the numerous antiquities are photographed as if part of a museum exhibition on the subject. A group of 7th-century B.C. pottery vessels found in a tomb near Bethlehem exemplify the \\"metaphor of the potter [Jeremiah] used to clarify his prophetic message.\\" Hieroglyphics, statues, passages from ancient texts, and impressions on coins are similarly used to illustrate parts of the Bible. From Mitchell's approach, limited though it is to materials from the British Museum, one learns a good deal about both the Bible and related ancient cultures.	2004-09-28

One of the appendices is a list of the household effects relating to Chandler. But the book is of interest mostly for the sympathies and activities of the young Elizabeth Chandler regarding the issue of abolition. She died in 1834 before she was 30. The letters are written in the now-archaic language used by the Quakers of the time--e. g., \\"I thank thee my dear Elizabeth for thy large sheet or sheets so well filled for I believe there are several of thy letters yet unanswered by me...,\\" from a lengthy letter by Chandler's aunt to her. The length of many of the letters, which go on for three or more pages, imparts to an exceptional degree the thoughts and activities of the individuals as well as their relationships with others. In her short life spent mostly in Michigan, Chandler contributed much to raising the consciousness of the region about the issue of abolition. The founder of the Logan Female Antislavery Society, she is also seen as an early activist in the fledgling women's movement. When she died, some individuals were moved to write poems about her. These are included in another appendix. The voluminous and varied materials brought together with editor Mason's deft sense of organization and worthiness is not only an invaluable source book on the little-known but influential Chadler; but it is a rich picture of individuals and their involvement in a major social issue of the time as well as their ordinary, daily activities and concerns. From the length and depth of the letters of Chandler and others she communicated with, the reader becomes involved with them as if they were subjects of a biography or characters in a historical novel. <br />	2004-09-28

Robin Muir, former picture edition of the British \\"Vogue,\\" follows Parkinson's career with an introduction and with an essay and gallery of representative photographs from each decade from the 1930s to the '80s. Parkinson died in 1990 while on location for a photo shoot. Parkinson managed to remain at the center of the highly-competitive field of fashion photography for the most demanding fashion magazines because his photographic genius was such that he adapted to the styles, celebrities, imagination, and interests of each decade without loosing his exceptional, uncompromising gift. His buoyant, mannerly personality going with his self-evident professionalism played a part in this. A Parkinson photograph from the 1980s stands out as clearly as one from the beginning of his career in the 1930s, as does one from any other decade. This finely-produced art book with informative and knowledgeable text and over 100 full-page photos, most in color, is a fitting commemoration of this incomparable fashion photographer who left an indelible mark on the field. <br />	2004-09-28

Ornamental grasses are becoming increasing popular with today's gardeners because of their textures, variety, and adaptability. And because, as the numerous photographs show, they make for attractive gardens and landscapes that do not appear overly manicured.

Also a center for traditional Japanese printmaking, it was natural that kites and kite-flying would often be depicted on prints. Stevenson, who has spent much time in Asia, treats the intertwined subjects of kites and prints with a historical overview that includes frequent discussions of particular kites and prints. \\"These kites [depicted in a print] must be large: the kite the young men are flying requires two to control the line, with a third looping the line into a basket.\\" Besides depicting ceremonial or recreational kite-flying, prints could also use kites symbolically, as when one artist suggests that confetti falling from a kite could be seeds being scattered over a field by farmers hoping for a good harvest. Such symbolisms indicate the meaningful place held by kites in the culture, almost as if they were religious or ritualistic objects. Stevenson's narrative and analyses for newcomers to the subject or advanced students complemented by colorful prints and details of them, including a number of large fold-outs, brings this somewhat specialized subject to life. With the author's special interest in kites as a part of Asian culture and his many years living in Asia, the subject seems second nature to him. He writes about it both naturally and knowledgeably, as if one were listening to an absorbing lecturer. <br />	2004-09-28

The two South American authors with extensive experience in international magazines and media focus on eight magazines that had leading roles in bringing about the contemporary visual culture and which to varying degrees continue to influence and reflect it. The eight are Time, Hola!, Life, Paris Match, Reader's Digest, People, Der Spiegel, and National Geographic. Time, for example, founded in the early 1920s, created the mold for news coverage which is followed by other news magazines and TV news programs down to today. Life pioneered photojournalism, and laid the groundwork for the media treatment of celebrity. National Geographic helped to popularize many areas of science, from paleontology to astronomy; and in more recent years, raise environmental and multicultural concerns. By covering eclectic and unpredictable subjects, Reader's Digest and People were instrumental in the ascendancy of popular culture. The foreign magazines from Spain, France, and German had similar influences on their respective cultures, while at the same time, like the U. S. publications, had a part in bringing about the global culture of media, celebrity, and entertainment. The authors Angeletti and Oliva explain the strategies of the founder of each of the magazines which allowed them to become so successful even though the odds were heavily against them. About half of the content is photographs or art work from the magazines over the years. As the text relates the playing out of the strategies in the adaptations to cultural and competitive changes over the years, the extensive visual matter is a record of visual styles in media over the years. Some photos or illustrations are cultural hallmarks. The work is a notable contribution to media studies for bringing together the leading magazines so as to put them alongside the newer media such as TV and computers as a part of the media field that has taken a central, formulative role in today's society. <br />	2004-09-28

After an arduous trek across the forbidding Tibetan mountainous terrain, they arrived in the capital of Lhasa--only to find themselves at the center of precarious international affairs. The Chinese were trying to take over Tibet. Since the U. S. was an ally of China in the war against Japan, the Tibetans could not believe that the American airmen were not somehow involved with China's hostile aims toward their country. The Chinese were concerned that the airmen would be witnesses to their actions taken to occupy Tibet even while the U. S. government was trying to keep the Chinese movements from becoming widely known. The authors tell this complex, engaging tale clearly, skillfully keeping its different elements in balance while keeping a focus on the plight of the airmen resented by both Tibet and China and dealt with at arm's length by the U. S. until they made their timely overland escape to India with the aid of British citizens in the region who were acting as surrogates for the American government. The authors, both journalists, recount the full story of this little-known episode of WWII that has heretofore received only passing attention. From their travels to mountainous areas of Asia, they bring a special sense of the five airmen's struggles to survive in the Tibetan terrain at the beginning and again at the end of their incredible story. <br />	2004-09-28

The films also evidence that Western literary and cultural influences are a part of Chinese cinema. The influence of Freud, Faulkner, and Dostoevsky can be seen in one or more of the films; and, not surprisingly, the cinematic techniques of Hitchcock are seen, as well those of David Lynch and Jean Luc-Godard. \\"The [Chinese] films are remarkable for their intellectual depth and range, their layered complexity, their emotional sobriety, their appeal to a sophisticated film audience rather than a mass market, their determined critique of contemporary culture...and the resonance of their moral voice.\\" The same could be said for Western art films, which the Chinese films plainly resemble, to the point of imitation in many ways. In a pocket inside the back cover is a CD with scenes from the movies. Silbergeld's selection of only three distinctive, yet in many ways representative films makes for an efficient, yet pithy exposure to the best of Chinese art films; which films are gaining more attention as China's economic and political power grows. <br />	2004-09-28

Along with key biographical facts, entries for each of the numerous saints discuss symbols, settings, poses, clothing, and objects commonly included in paintings or other artistic representations of the respective saint and why these details are associated with him or her. With each entry is a work of art in which the saint is pictured. The large-size, glossy-paged reference has the quality of a coffee-table art book. But its primary purpose is helping reader identify saints in works of art mostly from the Middle Ages and Renaissance, but from other eras as well. The well-thought-out reference is useful in different ways. One can go through the \\"Historical Survey\\" in order or randomly to learn about the saints as they have been represented in works of art throughout history and look at the related works of art. The Index, on the other hand, lists the many details found in works of art on saints so that one can find a particular saint from details in a particular work--which one might have seen in a museum or public square in Italy, for example. And there's a third approach to coming to understand and appreciate the the portrayals of saints that have been a large part of Western and Near Eastern visual art in past centuries: The \\"Dictionary of Saints with Their Attributes\\" is a visual, alphabetical cataloguing of the saints in typical poses with typical garb and holding or alongside typical symbols or objects. The black-and-white illustrations of the Dictionary can be compared to an image one might have seen or recalled; and then one is directed to the written entry to learn about the saint and the work of art where one saw the image. For its comprehensiveness, attractiveness, and usefulness as a reference, this work is patently a leading work in its field.

Dennis was one of the first furniture-makers in America to gain notoriety. Coming to America and settling in the Massachusetts village of Ipswich in the mid 1600s, Dennis used many of the techniques and styles found in British furniture-making of this period. Yet having to select appropriate trees from American forests, usually in consideration of village laws relating to certain kinds of trees, work with other American craftsmen, make furniture to order from nearby residents, and give it suitable embellishments for attractiveness, Dennis is seen as an originator of American woodworking and furniture-making. But in this work, Tarule is not interested in a study of furniture-making, or a history of it. The author's concern is the work and expertise Dennis put into making one oak chest. From the author's following this in detail, one learns a great deal about 17th-century furniture-making and also the regional Colonial society. For Dennis is viewed in the narrative as both a extraordinary and respected craftsman and a member of the community which supported and shaped his trade. Tarule does not simply say what kind of wood the particular chest was made of, but takes the reader right with Dennis as he goes to the nearby woods looking for a tree with suitable oak tree, keeping in mind the village's laws. \\"As soon as Thomas Dennis entered the Ipswich woods, he was in the New World. The forest was primordial...The sort of trees Dennis looked for are apparent in his furniture. The wood is close grained....\\" And so on with a discussion of different types of oak trees whose characteristics Ipswich artists knew from \\"forest type, slope degree and direction, dampness of the ground, soil conditions, and even genetic variation on local trees.\\" Tarule even engages in a comparison of British forests and American forests of the period, and changes in American forests over time. Tarule weaves a fascinating narrative under the general heading of Americana of interest to diverse readers such as antique dealers, woodworkers, and American Colonial historians. <br />	2004-09-28

Nietzsche is dealt with in a few places, but McGrath locates the sources of atheism mainly in the period leading up to the French Revolution of the late 1800s when the centuries-old place of the Catholic Church, along with the place of the monarchy, was challenged, and drastically minimalized by subsequent revolutionary events and related political and cultural changes. Darwin and later Freud are seen as prime expressions of the atheism in the European cultural milieu after the French Revolution. Recognizing the extent of atheism in its various forms in the era of modernism down to today as well as its strong appeal considering the failures of religion and government, McGrath nonetheless detects that atheism has reached its limits, and that large numbers of persons in postmodern society are being prompted to \\"explore...the forbidden fruit of spirituality.\\" The religious fundamentalism of many American Christians or Islamic radicals is ordinarily pointed to as evidence of the limitations and deficiencies of atheism and the secularism that is closely related to it in the contemporary world. But McGrath goes beyond this to lay out the reasons for and attractions of atheism as a vital force which could continue to play a central role in the culture if today's religious fundamentalism repeats the errors of religion in the past which gave rise to atheism and made it such a powerful, and in some ways a hopeful, restorative force. <br />	2004-09-28

Born in Havana, Cuba, she came to the U. S. as a political refugee with her family when she was 12. Beginning in her artistic training at the U. of Iowa, she incorporated feminist and multicultural leanings into the conceptual art, land art, photography, and performance art she practiced with equal intensity and innovation. No matter what type of art she engaged in, Mendieta used her own body, or sometimes images or impressions of it, as a medium. With earth, blood, streams, shoreline, trees, and foliage, Mendieta meant to teach viewers about the close, intimate connection between a person's body and the natural world. With other art works, she makes statements about the savagery of rape and tyranny. No matter what point she means to convey or type of art she engages in, Mendieta's art is distinguished by its exceptional rawness. While the rawness is often inevitably provocative, it strikes one mostly as unaltered, immediate reality. The copious photographic record of Mendieta's art with essays by art experts who knew her or are familiar with her is a comprehensive appreciation of the short career of this artist who work both strikingly and complexly mixes artistic, political, and cultural elements of contemporary society. <br />	2004-09-28

Because of this, he was able to work out a satisfactory arrangement between the local Inupiaq Eskimo tribe and scientists interested in whales for scientific and environmental reasons. Most importantly to the Inupiaqs, the tribe was able to continue hunting whales as they had since time immemorial. For the Inupiaqs, such whale-hunting was a fundamental part of their culture, as the Plains Indians hunted buffalo. The cycle of the year centered on whale hunting, and many community events were based on the hunts and the cutting up, cooking, and preservation of the whales killed in a hunt. One would hardly realize Brower was not a native Eskimo steeped in the culture. His conversations range over all parts of Eskimo life--family life, surviving the winters, holidays, the inroads of European culture, hunting, and religion. Brower is a rich font of Eskimo life and lore. But beyond this, the material is informative and fetching especially for its unique, first-hand, picture of whale hunting from the viewpoint of Eskimos.  <br />	2004-09-28

He quotes a Carl Freedman from his critique of writings of the philosopher Ernst Bloch: \\"[Utopia is not imagined] in the future...by mere chronological forecasting, or in mechanistic or philistine notions of bourgeois 'progress,' but rather as the future is the object of hope, of our deepest and most radical longings.\\" The following 14 essays, most by professors in fields of English, write about this \\"hope\\" as it is inherent in or reflected in different types of literature in different periods, from Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Player Piano,\\" David Mamet's play \\"The Water Engine,\\" Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" to William Gibson's \\"Neuromancer,\\" among many others. As the diverse works evidence, the utopian vision rising out of hope has at times been portrayed as resulting in dystopian conditions. Most of the essays focus on single works or a couple. A few deal with the topic as found in areas such as writings by women or romantic fantasy, as seen in the writings of Ursula K. Le Guin or Tolkein. By taking a long historical view of this genre which has become especially popular in today's technological, futuristic age as well as in-depth critical views on some of the most popular and influential works, the collected articles bring a new appreciation of the utopian fantastic literature. It is no longer seen as essentially escapism or fantasy, but as central to the modern psyche. <br />	2004-09-28

Anyone wishing to get a comprehension of the origins of this War, the seeming irresolvable conflicts of the region throughout the twentieth century, and the contemporary situation involving the NATO countries, including the U. S., could not find a better source than Chernozemsky's \\"Lion of the Balkans.\\" The author had relatives, including a grandfather in the military, who were involved in the events he writes about. And from his activities as a poet and documentary filmmaker in Sofia, he had to hastily make an escape to the West when Communist State Security agents were after him for espionage. Since his escape from Bulgaria, Chernozemsky has lived in northern Africa, Europe, and lately the United States. <br />     The complex historical tale the author weaves is prefaced by six maps showing the changing political and national boundaries of the Balkan region, particularly Bulgaria, from the middle of the nineteenth century until the First World War. Prefacing the narrative is also a three-page list of \\"Principal Characters.\\" Indicating the scope and complexity of the novel reflecting the historical realities and events of the early 1900s, these characters range from Bulgarian royalty, Turkish rulers and administrators, officers and soldiers in the warring military factions, government officials and religious figures, and diplomats to family members and common people such as a cook and a houseboy. Most are forced to take sides in the struggle between the Turkish Ottoman rulers intent in maintaining their hold on the region and the Bulgarians and other nationalist and ethnic groups who set aside their own conflicts for the time to try to drive the Turks out. But there are also several characters such as scheming, ruthless Turkish rulers and committed Bulgarian nationalists whose activities are followed from beginning to end to hold the panoramic, shifting narrative together. <br />     It is Bulgaria risking all to throw off the Turkish yoke that is the Lion of the Balkans. Improbably, Bulgaria succeeded in its war against the Ottoman Empire. But in succeeding, it exposed the decay that had set into the Empire, which set the stage for WWI. Bulgaria was not to enjoy its hard-won victory for long. World Wars I and II and subsequent Communist rule only reignited the ethnic and regional rivalries in Bulgaria and the rest of the Balkans to bring other trials and terrors to the troubled region. Chernozemsky's sweeping historical novel not only relates a picture of the historical events, but also imparts an understanding of the complex, fragile network of groups and types of persons inhabiting this critical region.	2004-09-23

In charting the background leading up to the well-coordinated murderous purge of most persons in Germany who would even remotely resist Hitler's seizure of power, Maracin draws profiles of Hitler's top accomplices <br />(e. g., Gobbels, Himmler) and of the major victims too. A retired criminal investigator, Maracin gives a broad view of this few hours during which Hitler laid the ground for his eventual dictatorship, showing how the many actors played their part so as to reveal Hitler's ruthlessness and dementia and the web of evil he wove.	2004-09-06

St. Clair's commentaries are informative, and his deductions will likely be regarded as bases for further studies. But it is the methodology and the unprecedented details on book publishing and many individual titles contained in 13 appendices of more than 250 pages which will especially draw the attention of many readers, historians, professors, and others in this area. For the appendices somewhat schematically indicate the methodology and present the data for the deductions. The author's painstaking efforts and publisher's equally meticulous efforts to accurately record, classify, and arrange the novel data in smaller type with footnotes account for the high price of the book. <br />     Focusing on publishing and reading--the sociology of reading it might be called--of the Romantic period in England, St. Clair at first exposes the errors of presumptions and perspectives that are commonly taken for granted in understandings and in other studies of his subject. Rather than the historian's or literary critic's approach, St. Clair adopts basically that of the statistician determined to get at the truth about the presence, distribution, and effects of books in society as far as this can be found. An example of the effects on print runs of the 1774 decisions [as to number of copies printing]; The main old-canon poets printed in the tiniest of formats, the cheapest achievably at the limits of manufacturing technology; Novels published at author's expense, are but three of the hundreds of specialized categories of the volume of data in the appendices. As St. Clair rightly notes, the common presumptions and perspectives are not founded on empirical evidence such as numbers of copies printed, subsequent printings, the timing of publication, etc.; nor are they capable of uncoveringand properly weighing such empirical evidence. The old presumptions and perspectives reflected the literary temperaments and sentiments about literature of such historians and others. <br />     St. Clair uncompromisingly brings an economist's and statistician's requirements of evidence and conservative assessments of it to his magisterial study of publishing, books, readers, and the society and economy they were a part of. \\"How to assess influence is among the most difficult of all the methodological challenges that historians face in attempting to understand the diffusionary rise and fall of ideas\\" is but one of the author's remarks exemplifying his questioning of the accepted knowledge in the field and setting out his own clear, though not dogmatic, premises. A former high official in the British Treasury, St. Clair is now a Senior Research Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge University. The author, with his great respect for simple logic and plain facts along with his innate conservativism in putting forth his new views, has not cast a rock against the house of embedded ideas about publishing, books, and readers. Rather, he has put out a lodestone which is likely to reformulate the study of books and related subjects.	2004-09-06

The Dweller reawakened on the island of Ponape where an ancient civilization once existed by a Dr. David Throckmartin and his group of scientist explorers is a vampire seeking new souls to devour. Merritt's fantasy about the Manichean struggle between good and evil is colored by his interest in the mystic Madame Blavatsky. Looked on unfavorably by some leading critics of the time, Merritt never gained much notice outside of the field of science fiction. For later generations, his ornate style limited his appeal. But he holds considerable historical interest in this genre of popular literature for opening it up to diverse elements such as developments in the sciences of physics and biology, figures from folk literature, literary references of all types (e. g., Celtic literature), and philosophical and religious ideas and themes like Blavatsky's mysticism which were all a part of his eclectic erudition. One sees such effects not only in today's fantasy literature, but also the popular fantasy movies.	2004-09-06

Robert Wellford (1775-1844) of Philadelphia was the leading maker of compo in the U. S. during this period. The neoclassical flourishes, forms, and mythological and other figures of composition along with patriotic imagery became popular in well-to-do homes along the coast from South Carolina to New Jersey because of the sense of elegance it added to rooms, but also because it was affordable by not having to be imported. Reinberger gives a full account of this American decoration which became prevalent in the early decades of the new nation. His account complemented with many photographs of varying detail deals with the manufacture of the composition, its different styles, the spread of it, and the fading of this \\"feminine\\" art form with the coming to favor of the \\"masculine\\" style of decoration modeled on the Doric Greek classical style. Wellford's career as a talented and ambitious businessman is also covered. This is a thorough work for architects, decorators, historians, and artists on the relatively brief period of a few decades when compo was the ornamentation of choice in buildings along the East Coast and embodied ideas about high style and desirable expression of the virtues and ideals of the new democracy. Reinberger is an associate professor in the College of the Environment and Design at the U. of Georgia. Historic preservation is one of the courses he teaches.	2004-09-05

Kitroeff brings to light the tensions within modern Greece between representing in various ways the ancient Greek culture that is a foundation of Western civilization and pursuing political and economic interests in becoming more integrated into Europe and being recognized as a fully modern nation. With European scholars and historians often ascribing historical roles and influences Greece itself did not necessarily accept, Greece was not always able to determine how other nations and peoples saw it. Kitroeff goes in to these complexities to present the modern Greek mentality and society so that readers come to comprehend Greece in a relevant, multi-faceted, and progressive way rather than as simply a symbol for an ancient culture that the Olympics were part of. In this, Kitroeff also relates Greece's participation in the modern Olympic games. The author is an associate professor of history at Haverford College and coeditor of The Journal of the Hellenic Diaspora and author of many books.	2004-09-05

The Abbe was active in this area in the late 1800s. He was himself a controversial figure who antagonized French politicians while also currying favor with local wealthy patrons who helped him with his project. The Abbe's project also calls into question the place of Jesus's mother Mary in the foundation of the Catholic Church and Christianity. Markale does much guesswork based on bringing together clues scattered widely over time and place to shed light on and raise both theological and historical questions about the origins and shaping of Christianity. He's the author of previous books on similar subjects and ancient Celtic culture.	2004-09-05

S. government's Indian Removal Act of 1830. But this was only the beginning of their travails. In Indian Territory, they faced hostility from tribes already settled there, along with diseases, natural disasters, and starvation. Akers, a professor of history at Purdue and a Choctaw Nation tribal member, follows how the Choctaws managed to overcome such hardships by intermixing with other groups and developing their own micro-economy based on cotton plantations linked to the world market for this commodidity. Like other tribes, the Choctows also had to deal with betrayals of agreements with them by the U. S. government. At best, they worked out an ambivalent mode of survival involving adaptations to regional economic and social conditions and measures to preserve their identity and heritage even though they had been transplanted. Akers sets out the historical account with a multicultural sensitivity to the Choctow's perduring, though at times frayed, desire to hold on to to their traditonal ways.	2004-09-05

What Westermeyer's book accomplishes is giving an individual a perspective on depression, thus helping her or him to see that it need not be all-consuming. Once realizing this, an individual can begin to gain control over depression. Along with this perspective, the author relates various proven techniques enabling one to cope with depression, and over time overcome it. <br />     Westermeyer's approach to working with individuals suffering from depression has been introduced to some medical facilities, and the author has been recognized by other professionals in the field for his work in this type of treatment of depression. In Westermeyer's treatment, \\"patients are expected to practice [the] skills and by so doing, treat their depression.\\" In this innovative and effective treatment, depressed individuals are regarded more as collaborators with the psychologist or other medical professional than as patients in the traditional sense. This largely self-help approach Westermeyer relates is appealing to today's public with an interest in taking charge of their own health problems as well as the medical profession's adjustments to work more closely with patients as individuals who can play a major part in remedying their ailments. <br />     Keeping a journal, analysis of thoughts, social activities, motivation, and ways of keeping depression from recurring are among the topics included to help individuals learn how to get the upper hand on their depression. Westermeyer's well-paced, reader-friendly style is not only instructive, but also encouraging to the reader. It is apparent he is concerned about the reader's depression, and is sympathetically reaching out with advice and techniques he has seen alleviate depression in his own extensive experience. The recognition that the individual is the most important agent in dealing effectively with a depression extends to the inclusion of removable laminated \\"Cognitive Coping Cards\\" at the back of the book for an individual to carry with him or her to review in developing the beneficial perspective or refer to when experiencing a severe mood associated with depression. <br />	2004-09-03

Kovacs' husband Istvan shared in the journey to a profound understanding of this momentous event in their lives. \\"The Miracle of Death\\" has much broader appeal than its apparent New-Age topic. It will draw as well readers interested in grieving and grief studies, women's memoirs, family studies, and psychological and spiritual journeys and quests. Kovacs cites historical and mythological studies, individual experiences surrounding death, and cutting-edge science to support a radical change in the way we think about death and life.<br />     In the course of her revelations, Kovacs came to realize that her formal education and professional activity had imposed limitations on her understanding. She felt her customary ways of thinking and comprehending breaking down under the impact of her son's untimely death. Moving beyond her past experiences and learning, she became open to experiences and aspects of reality she had been blind to. A short passage of Christopher Fry quoted by Kovacs summarizes her journey and what she learned--\\"...there is an angle of experience where the dark is distilled into light....\\" Kovacs found that angle. In so openly, honestly, and sensitively relating her experience in assimilating the meaning of her son's death, Kovacs can also open the reader's life to ordinarily buried dimensions of existence and experience.<br />Henry Berry, book reviewer<BR>The Small Press Book Review	2003-04-09

Nutrition with regard to different sports is also  discussed--a subject probably not given particular consideration by many  parents. The co-authors have a down-to-earth style in dealing with the wide  range of subjects of interest and concern to today's parents. An  outstanding, authoritative, yet practical and readable book which  understands the situation and concerns of parents in this area of their  children and sports.<br />Henry Berry<br />Book Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The  Small Press Book Review	2000-01-25

Aslan Publishing. 1999. 184 pp.<br /> Kane begins her story withher receipt in 1993 of a special-delivery letter from her son from a teenage pregnancy in 1947 whom she had put up for adoption and had not seen since then. At the time, Catholic nuns had told her, 3Forget it and get on with your life.2--and she had tried to follow their advice even though she could never completely keep thoughts of him out of her mind, especially when so many young men his age were being sent to war in Vietnam. Kane told her husband-to-be Charles about this episode in her past before they married. They had two daughters, one of whom died of cancer. This sadness in her life which intensified the author1s thoughts about the fate of her adopted son, although she never developed any intention of trying to find him.<br /> Her subsequent meeting changed her mind on the matter. She realized that it was inestimably beneficial emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually for both herself and her son to meet, and to develop a relationship they never had. And she realized that for the longest time she had been suppressing desires to have her son in her life. Kane found too that reunion with her son brought back memories of her younger years which she had to face. It was a time of anxiety, growth, and unprecedented happiness for Kane--a story she relates in an honest, plain, and deeply touching way.<br />Henry Berry<br />Book Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review END	1999-12-21

Bremer's first book, Untechnical Writing, covered the field of technical writing in general; this The User Manual Manual, as the title says, deals with manuals for lay persons on how to use computer software. The importance of such manuals for computer users these days is apparent. Bremer makes the points that easy-to-follow manuals obviously make it easier for lay persons to operate computers using the software; which means that such manuals are clearly to the benefit of computer makers and software developers. And he makes the second point that easy-to-follow manuals reduce the support computer manufacturers and software producers have to provide to customers. As self-evident as these points are, Bremer wonders if companies in the computer and software business have grasped them--as probably do the majority of lay persons trying to make sense of most user manuals.<br /> With more than 20 years in technology industries, including manager of writing teams, Bremer knows the elements, slant, and aims of user manuals inside out, including how they are developed by teamwork among segments of a company and also the creativity and skills of individual writers. He gives experienced, detailed, relevant advice and directions for making a user manual satisfy its ultimate aim of being reader-friendly and therefore contributing to the place of computers and software in individuals' lives.<br />Henry Berry<br />Book Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review END	1999-12-21

Aslan Publishing. 1999. 225 pp.<br /> Valerie Harmsunderstands that not all love is meant to result in a relationship with the person arousing the love in one.  Circumstances, including a relationship with someone else, may stand in the way. When such love is aroused, individuals often feel troubled from frustration, guilt, doubt, or a mixture of these and other emotions. But as Harms teaches, this need not be the case. As she says, &quot;When we become attentive to our fantasies and dreams [aroused by love], loving and not condemning our deepest wishes, we give them a chance to direct and empower our lives.&quot; Adhering to this principle, she teaches how to make such love a positive experience.<br /> In exploring this kind of love, Harms focuses on the self--how the self can maintain its wholeness and singular potential and be empowered by the love's creative, unpredictable forces.  This positive involvement with the love she explores not only fulfills one as a person, but also enhances one's place and value in all relationships.  Harms has one of the best understandings of love a reader can find. Among her previous books are &quot;Stars in My Skin/Nin, Montessori, Steloff&quot; and &quot;Unmasking: Ten Women in Metamorphosis.&quot;<br />Henry Berry<br />Book Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review	1999-12-21

Although  he calls this style untechnical writing, as the subtitle notes, it involves  technical subjects, particularly manuals for computers and software. He  does not simply apply the familiar precepts of good, serviceable, effective  business communications and other nonfiction writing to technical writing  in the computer field. Rather, Bremer deals specifically, and thoroughly,  with the varied sources and purposes of writing in this field; which he  sees as a new field of writing calling for the new approaches to writing he  expounds. He gives writers clear-headed, experienced guidance on how to  make different sorts of technical subjects comprehensible and applicable to  general readers. This is obviously an important task in today1s growing  technological society. Bremer1s timely manual is a highly-recommended guide  and reference for any writer wishing to write comprehensibly and  effectively about technical subjects for non-technical readers.<br />Henry  Berry, Book Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review	1999-11-22

In The Turnaround, Chuck Mottley shows  you how this is so. In 1994, the football team the Chaparral Firebirds of  Scottsdale, Arizona, had a 0-10 record. Two years later under Ron  Estabrook's coaching leadership, the determination and example of several  leading players, and the commitment and support of the entire team, the  Firebirds achieved a 10-0 record which gave the team a chance at the state  championship.<br />     Mottley goes through the team's winning season  game-by-game relating the emotional mood of the players and coaches along  with highlights of each game, noting plays, strategy, and tactics. The  reader gets an inside look at the game of football as well as experiences  the team's feelings and circumstances in the course of the season. The  Turnaround is an engaging, encouraging story for readers of all ages that  gets to the essence of sport. In this day of heavy marketing of  professional and college teams featuring their often pampered superstars,  Mottley's tale offers a refreshing look--a reminder--at the important place  sports can have in the lives of individuals.<br />Henry Berry, Book  Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review	1999-11-15

Thomas, M.D. VanderWyk &amp; Burnham, MA. 1999. 240 pp. $21.95 hardcover.  illustrations. <br />Like a fable, Learning from Hannah divulges deep truths  about human nature while imparting a timeless moral message. The author  Thomas is so identified with his novel that its main characters have the  names of the author and his wife, Bill and Jude. Nearly losing their lives  when their sailboat capsizes in a storm while on vacation, Bill and Jude  survive by being swept to the island of Kallimos. There, they come under  the care of Hannah. While helping them to regain their strength, Hannah  teaches them a wisdom arising from a natural, communal way of life, the way  of life on Kallimos. The core of this way of life is the relationship  between elders and younger generations whereby the younger take care of the  older, who in turn impart their wisdom to them to make their lives richer  and more meaningful. Among the precepts Bill and Jude learn are &quot;Trust  in each other allows us the pleasure of answering the needs of the  moment&quot; and &quot;To give care to another makes us stronger&quot;.  <br />Thomas's novel is one of the ways he is publicizing his ideas about the  place of elders in society.

On the grounds of extensive research, Bissell makes the case that the Singer Sewing Machine Company was a leader in the industrialization leading to rising standards  of living for the masses of average persons, beginning in the U. S. in the  decades before the Civil War and continuing well into the 20th century. The  Company was a leader not only in developing the sewing machine providing  well-made, mass-produced clothing, but also in creating a large labor  force, implementing progressive employee and business practices, and  standing as a model for other companies formed in the course of  industrialization. Indeed, the Singer Sewing Machine Company was so  successful and so respected over a wide area of the globe that in the  language of many Third World countries, the word singer is used for the  noun sewing-machine and the verb to sew.<br />Bissell follows the history of  the Company mostly by profiles of its succession of presidents focusing in  their perspectives and practices as they faced different economic and  social circumstances in the long history of the Company. Singer1s  reputation and success suffered a severe setback in 1987 after a hostile  takeover by Paul Bilzerian, who was later indicted on tax and securities  violations. Only in the past five years or so has Singer been able to  recover from this and regain something of its former prominent position.  For following the Singer Sewing Machine Company from its founding until  today, Bissell1s history of this major American Company is the definitive  book on this subject.<br />Henry Berry, Book Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The  Small Press Book Review	1999-06-19

Sunny Books, New York, NY. 1999. 300 pp. $12.95 trade paper.<br />The author claims to have gotten the inspiration for writing his humorous novel The Missionary's Position from  being hit on the head with a coconut while vacationing on a Caribbean  island. Set on two fictional Caribbean-like islands named Snow and St.  Ursula, the novel follows the adventures--misadventures--of a zany cast of  characters including the director of a local historical society, Philip  Doyle; the fantastically wealthy Roberta Gibbleman and her mischievous  daughter Wendy; and the comical despot Austin Sewer. The foil for setting  these and related characters scheming and vying with one another is the  competition between Doyle and Sewer to make their respective islands of  Snow and St. Ursula the leading tourist attraction. A travel writer turning  to fiction with this novel, Buslik hits just the right note in humorously  portraying the carefree, gay ambience of a Caribbean island vacation spot  and the casual, insouciant, dreamy but feckless behavior of its  inhabitants.

Ross1s attention to certain problematic  issues and also circumstances pertaining to the individual desiring to make  friends--as opposed to simply spouting general attitudes or  prescriptions--are what makes his handbook especially relevant and helpful.  For example, Ross discusses how problems with addiction can interfere with  trying to make friends, and then goes into how to overcome these problems.  Problems posed by the personality trait of shyness is another topic Ross  similarly treats. This author also recognizes the bearing that  circumstances of one's life such as moving to a new location or just  entering retirement have on making friends--and he gives sensible advise  and offers resources on these sorts of considerations. Ross learned about  the worth and meaning of friendship the hard way: by staying in a bad  relationship for more than a decade. Imparting instructive anecdotes from  his own experience as well as from the lives of others he's known, and also  making use of lists of important points and brief questionnaires and forms  for taking stock of oneself and one's situation, Ross provides a handbook  that is at once empathetic and practical.<br />Henry Berry, Book  Reviewer<br />Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review	1999-04-07

The appeal of the hobby of  collecting the bitters bottles is evident from the many color photographs  of bottles showing their varied curved or squared shapes and golden, green,  and brown tints. Wichmann is an expert in this area of antiques whose  Introduction and other background material presents interesting historical  and social information and hones in on details of bottles. One section, for  instance, discusses the number of different kinds of tops and necks of  bitters bottles, with a related page of close-up photographs showing 15  different types of these. Besides the interesting and knowledgeable general  material on this popular avocation, Wichmann also provides historical  background and identification markings for about 100 different makes of  bitters bottles--e. g., Boggs Cottman German Tonic; Lash's Kidney and Liver  Bitters; Dr. Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. The colorful names alone are  enough to attract one to this hobby. As with the high-quality colorful  photographs of the bottles, color photographs of labels and ads for many of  the bottles for specific makes of bitters vividly capture their details and  color.

The Big Empty is an appropriate metaphor for GistÕs first  novel about a group of descendants of original settlers, who were known as  ÒcraziesÓ for leaving the main trials. The men and women are possessed by  an indefinable emptiness which they try at best fitfully to fill with other  individuals, with religion, with drink or sex, or with trying to connect to  the land. But instead of finding anything enriching, the individuals only  project their own emptinesses into these aspects of their lives, absolute  as their emptinesses are. Gist effectively evokes the various tones of  hopelessness in his characters and pictures their all-too-human, yet  ultimately thankless, efforts to find some meaning and direction. Set in  the stark, thinly, populated wilds of Wyoming, GistÕs CrowHeart starkly  portrays the passions, sorrows, hopes, and tragedies of his characters  untempered by ordinary society.

In a narrative variously folksy, lyrical, romantic, reminiscent, and  descriptive, Marlene Allen recounts this long voyage down the west coast of  California and Mexico, out to Tahiti and Hawaii, and back to California.  The joys of sailing, as well as its practicalities which can sometimes be  bothersome, are palpable in her open, personable, account. Her journal-like  narrative records as well as few alarming moments that came up along the  way. And more than just a tale of a memorable sea voyage, Running with the  Tide is a story about the rich later years of a long-lasting marriage. Many  readers will be pleased by this aspect, although the work can be followed  as an engaging, easy-to-read, and to some degree informative, account of a  long sail through a large part of the Pacific.

Maharatha Books, Middleburg, FL. 1998 (new edition). 334 pp. $16.50 trade paper.<br />Like the popular nonfiction book A Civil Action made into a movie,  Roger Hall1s Freedom from the Press is an absorbing account of an involved  lawsuit against a corporate powerhouse by an individual with important  personal interests at stake. This author1s case was a libel case against  the Houston Chronicle, which in 1991 ran a front-page article accompanied  by a photograph implying that Hall had once been a bona fide member of a  controversial New York cult rather than an unwitting recruit who had  ultimately tried to discredit it. Hall came under extraordinary pressure  because in a deposition he tied a local wealthy businessperson named  Douglas Wyatt to the cult. This was used by enemies of Wyatt to destroy his  reputation through the newspaper article. During one phase of his ordeal,  Hall felt his life was threatened. Hall1s small business shortly fell into  ruins, and he sunk into a severe depression. But he nonetheless managed to  carry out his lawsuit until after some setbacks that would have defeated  most persons, he prevailed in the end. Hall relates succinctly the legal  procedures and issues at stake, and takes you into his own emotional  turmoil. The reader holds his breath pulling for Hall against the powerful  interests set against him.<br />review by Henry Berry Book Reviewer  Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review	1999-02-19

The chapters generally follow the path of first feeling a  sense of being wounded through reaching a higher stage of personal growth  by overcoming the wounding. Auw frequently goes beyond inspiration to give  the reader a perspective on adverse circumstances and occasionally offers  practical advice for dealing with these. The chapters incorporate  instructive episodes and lessons from Auw1s own life and examples,  teachings, and counsel from esteemed individuals from various fields and  different times. Among these varied individuals are Carl Rogers (Auw1s  mentor), Dr. Kubler-Ross, Tom Robbins, St. Teresa, Norman Cousins, and Pope  John. Most of the chapters close with a quote or short passage of wisdom by  one such individual or from a well-known spiritual text. In offering solace  and hope, Auw1s counsel also contains a realistic vein that distinguishes  it from much contemporary inspirational, New Age-ish, writing. For  instance, Auw recognizes that not all wounds can be neutralized or erased,  but that they are frequently dealt with by personal growth. While Auw does  follow the successive stages of the process of being wounded and healing,  he does not present a methodical, pragmatic self-help program, but rather  offers essays that are variously inspirational, meditative, instructive,  and practical.<br />review by Henry Berry Book Reviewer Editor/Publisher, The  Small Press Book Review	1999-02-19

By and large, it  delivers on this. Vettese goes beyond guidance on how a woman can keep a  relationship strong and vibrant to deal with her own, distinct, emotional  growth and desires for self-respect and security in the context of the  relationship. The coauthor of Lifemates - The Love Fitness Program for a  Lasting Relationship and co-producer of audiotapes on health, Vettese  teaches and leads seminars on relationships, spirituality, and health and  well-being. As the subtitle of this book of hers implies, it takes up  working through the pains and disillusions that are inevitable in a  relationship and at times are even caused by it. But more broadly, it deals  with the common vulnerabilities of the two persons in a relationship and  the end of how the relationship can last and even flourish given these.  With personal anecdotes, examples of individuals in relationships, and  humane, relevant counsel, Vettese covers many sides of this reality of the  vulnerabilities of the persons in a relationship. Thirty-five exercises for  dealing with these many sides are highlighted in boxes. Vettese sensitively  explores central realities that are troubling in most relationships and  often lead to their break up, offering wise counsel and practical advice on  how individuals, especially a woman, can deal with these so that their  relationship holds together.<br />review by Henry Berry Book Reviewer  Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review	1999-02-19
