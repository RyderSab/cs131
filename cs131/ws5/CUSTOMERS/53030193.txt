Not only is its page size large, it is also unusually thick, with more than 600 large pages of full-color images and text. It may at first sound pricey, but when you see and hold the physical thing, it's hard to believe that it isn't a lot more expensive. It is, as announced by the subtitle, an encyclopedia of camouflage. But it's far, far more than only that. Only one dimension of it is military, since there are countless examples of pattern disruption in art, nature and culture. This single volume version is a must for anyone who is interested in natural form, the visual arts, deception, mimicry, and pattern play. It will keep you occupied for months. The only thing better that I know of is the two-volume boxed UK edition of the same book in which the second volume is exclusively devoted to camouflage patterns on military uniforms. It is more expensive of course, but it's well worth it, especially for collectors of extraordinary books. For more on that edition, see [...] or search the UK Amazon website.	2004-11-12

In this book, Bringhurst revisits a classic history of  typography, publication design and printing techniques that was originally  produced in 1970 by Chappell (1904-1991), a book designer, illustrator and  author who had studied with Rudolf Koch. Of eleven highly readable  chapters, all were written by Chappell, with the exception of the last on  &quot;The Digital Revolution and the Close of the Twentieth Century.&quot;  Why reissue Chappell's book? As Bringhurst explains in the preface,  &quot;He knew some of the things that historians know, but mostly he knew  what historians don't know. I wanted the names and dates set straight,  insofar as possible, and yet to hear the story told as Chappell told it,  from a workbench rather than a keyboard, with silences in place of  self-advertisements, and graver marks and acid stains in place of any  footnotes.&quot; (Review copyright  2000 by Roy R.

As the quintessential  expressionist, he has always overshadowed his younger brother, Theo, who  supported him both emotionally and monetarily, but who, as this book  documents, also pursued a successful career as a Paris-based art dealer.  Vincent took his own life in 1890; while Theo died a year later (at age  33), apparently of dementia paralytica, the last stage of syphilis. This  beautifully produced book, which consists of three scholarly essays, a  chronology and nearly 200 reproductions of historic photographs and works  of art, presents an account of the life of the two, while emphasizing the  larger context of Theo's activities as a dealer, who was, like his brother,  ahead of his time. It was published in conjunction with an exhibition at  museums in Amsterdam and Paris in 1999 and 2000 of works bought, sold  and/or collected by Theo Van Gogh. (Review copyright  by Roy R.

Before his death in 1940, he played a brief and minor role  in Albert Speer's plans for redesigning Berlin. The text is unrelenting in  its attempt to identify Behrens' own influences and trace the sequence of  his thoughts. It is assuredly richer because of the accompanying 250  illustrations, and, especially, the thoughtful and fitting design by Yasuyo  Iguchi. (Review copyright  2000 by Roy R.

The author is an artist, writer and  the son of Clive and Vanessa Bell, who was born at Gordon Square in  Bloomsbury in 1910.

It  consisted of three simple shapes: A sphere, cube and cylinder. The sphere  represented unity, the cube diversity, and the cylinder (which is spherical  from one angle, square from another) was a synthesis of the two, a  reconciliation of opposites. That simple toy, as Norman Brosterman said in  Inventing Kindergarten, was \\"the dialectic incarnate-Hegel for tots,\\" for  it taught children about analogical seeing, about similarity-in-difference,  and, as Froebel himself put it, that \\"all consequences lie dormant in their  antecedents.\\" This new book by the author of Good Looking, Artful Science  and Body Criticism (she teaches art history at the University of Chicago)  is a densely written but richly illustrated plea for the restoration of  analogy (the perception of someone or something as like what it is not) in  art and nonart visual forms, but also in everything else that we do. As a  culture, we withstand the damaging daily effects of \\"an explosion of  discontinuous happenings,\\" writes Stafford, brought on in part by the  emphasis on \\"personal statements, irreducibly distinctive subjects, and  contradictory opinions.\\" At the beginning of the new millennium, the  \\"diversification of diversity\\" (David Hollinger) and the postmodern assault  on analogical reasoning have left us \\"incapable of speaking across  differences.\\" (Copyright by Roy R.

Barbara Maria Stafford  (who teaches at the University of Chicago) is one of the chief innovators,  as is the author of this book, who teaches at the School of the Art  Institute of Chicago. Purely in terms of output, Elkins is phenomenal. In  the past five years, he has published eight important books (all of which,  without exception, are worth looking into): The Poetics of Perspective  (1995); The Object Stares Back: On the Nature of Seeing (1996); On Pictures  and the Words That Fail Them (1998); On Beautiful, Dry and Distant Texts:  Art History as Writing (1998); What Painting Is: How to Think About Oil  Painting, Using the Language of Alchemy (1998); Why Are Our Pictures  Puzzles?: On the Modern Origins of Pictorial Complexity (1999); Pictures of  the Body: Pain and Metamorphosis (1999), and this title, which is the  latest. How is this even possible? The answer in part is that all of his  books, while each is unique, are more or less about the same range of  issues: They are all about \\"art history on the edge,\\" about aspects of art  and design that defy categorization and that easily fall through the cracks  in doctoral research programs. Like Gyorgy Kepes (The New Landscape in  Science and Art) and E.H. Gombrich (Art and Illusion), whom Elkins must  surely be influenced by, he almost always argues (by example, if not by the  actual words that he writes) that art historians should look beyond their  traditional subject areas and focus as much on the images in science,  technology, commerce, medicine, music and archaeology.

Sterling Calder, and Sherry Fry) in the so-called  \\"guilded age\\" of art. She posed for both the head and tail of the 1916 U.S.  dime (the Mercury dime); as well as for statues that stand at the front of  the New York Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum of Art, on the fountain  outside of the Plaza Hotel, in the pediments at the entrance to the Frick  Collection, and (as the figure of Evangeline) at the Longfellow Memorial in  Massachusetts.   When the Beaux Arts tradition in sculpture was quashed  by the rise of Modernism, she tried to survive by performing in films about  artists' models, resulting in a great scandal because she appeared on the  screen totally nude. In 1919, when rumored to have been involved in the  murder of her landlord's wife (she wasn't), she collapsed emotionally  (described back then as \\"mental blight\\"), was ostracized as \\"Crazy Audrey,\\"  and, after a quest for a husband that failed, attempted suicide.   At  age 39, she was committed to an asylum, where she remained in obscurity  until her recent death at age 105. This book is a belated but sincere  attempt to restore her dignity.

Rybczynski traces Olmsted's  life, allotting equal emphasis to Olmsted's peregrinating early career, one  that meandered aimlessly through seemingly incompatible by-ways yet almost  predictably emerging with him as a pioneer landscape architect. Olmsted's  career, starting in 1858 with the design of Central Park in New York City,  resulted in an astounding achievement nationally, only recently being  generally appreciated.New Yorkers and Brooklynites were only the early  beneficiaries of his genius.  Though Rybczynski credits the series, a  serious reader must turn to the original materials available in the  magnificent series, The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted (Johns Hopkins  Press).Projected for twelve volumes, seven are now published, with an  auxiliary companion volume to volume one.Additionally, there has grown up  a large corpus of works about Olmsted.This new biography is a first-rate  addition and a fitting place to begin a study.

Carroll spent over 25 years working on this definitive biography of the Viennese-American composer (1897-1957).Â This unabashed encomium for the music of Korngold is supported by carefully crafted  arguments responding to critics, real and imagined.Â Carroll is especially  exercised about those critics whose prejudicial assessments of the Korngold  oeuvre are based solely on a superficial knowledge of Korngold's scores for  the motion pictures.Â Korngold himself was super-sensitive about his  reputation when it was based upon his Hollywood fame, though he never  disavowed the work he did there for the films, such as The Adventures of  Robin Hood, Captain Blood, Anthony Adverse, The Sea Hawk, Kings Row, Of  Human Bondage, and much more.Â He mainly feared, and rightly so, that the  film scores would over-shadow his earlier career in Europe when his serious  music might become lost.Â He worried, too, that even his film scores would  be lost along with the films as they faded from public view.  Korngold's complete oeuvre are Carroll's strongest defense.Â  From the age  of 10 (Yes, 10!), Korngold's works began to receive private notice.Â By 11  and 12, his prodigious first compositions dumbfounded and awed musicians  such as Gustav Mahler, Alexander von Zemlinsky (his composition teacher),  Richard Strauss, Bruno Walter, Puccini, and a host of other admirers and  performers.Â In 1910, he completed (age 13) his Piano Trio in D Major, Opus  1.Â In 1911, he met Max Reinhardt (his future collaborator), who brought him  to Hollywood, saving Korngold and his familyÂ from the concentration camps  in 1938.  Carroll is convincing that Korngold's greatest achievements  are his five operas, especially his Das Wunder der Heliane and Die tote  Stadt, for which he is best known in Europe.Â In 1999, his separate CDs are  approaching one hundred, making his music available as never  before.Â Following my own prolonged and extensive study, I predict that  Korngold's next career, based upon his recordings, will elevate him into  the empyrean of twentieth century composers.  Two commemorative postage  stamps have been issued about Korngold: In Austria, a stamp recalls his  operas (properly); in America, he is included among 5 other Hollywood  composers, as he anticipated.  Carroll's work is a great deal more than  a festschrift: It is a searching, well-written, objective account of the  life of his subject: Korngold.

The maxim \\"less is more\\" has long been associated with Modernism, while a more appropriate slogan for Postmodernism (said Robert Venturi) is \\"less is a bore\\" or \\"more is more.\\" This is hardly a new dichotomy because, as this  book explains, the primary squabbles in art and design have been about  complexity (more) versus simplicity (less).   \\"The histories of art and  design are replete with epochs, movements and styles that employ clutter as  an ideological or aesthetic reaction to purity,\\" the authors argue, and  since the 1980s (Postmodern, Retro, New Wave), \\"visual clutter has reigned  supreme.\\"   Using scores of examples of graphic design, the authors  predict that the pendulum has caromed off \\"more is more\\" and is now  swinging back toward a simpler, less layered approach to design. If so,  this is one of the earliest books to announce the new paradigm. (Copyright   by Roy R. Behrens, from Ballast Quarterly Review, Vol 15 No 2, Winter  1999-2000.)	2000-01-02

Well-known among environmentalists, ecologists, landscape architects and designers, he is Peck's bad boy, even persona non grata, to the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, developers, numerous (all?) corporate executives, governmental  officials (all levels), and a few university departments. No one believes  McHarg to be a benign force, and his autobiography testifies to his  lifelong snappish testiness.  Born in Scotland on November 20, 1920, he  grew up in the thrall of nature and became a Naturist (sic). His long,  active, and productive career as a \\"nature-intoxicated\\" landscape architect  is recorded in this detailed solo cantata, a well-deserved forte encomium  of one man's dedication to his own odyssey, his quest for life. It will be  a surprise if this tome fails to become a rallying point for future  ecological revolutions, for future Earth Days, for a Cult of the Living  Gaia.  McHarg is 18 months younger than I. Many of us \\"American\\" GIs of  WWII who grudgingly served a mere 3 or 4 years (1942-1945) must stand aside  for our European brothers. McHarg, along with uncounted fellow Brits and  other allies, served in sometimes hellish combat conditions for six or  seven years, a long period out of young lives. McHarg's account of his war  experiences are alone worth reading his story, told in dramatic, gripping  terms. Come to realize, so is the entire book.  McHarg's besetting sins  are his arrogance and his conceptual pugilism. On the other hand, his modus  vivendi, that determined his astoundingly productive successes, are his  arrogance and conceptual pugilism. As he fights for the right, he generally  is right-not exactly a social or political asset.  Recipient of  numerous academic and civic honors, he includes an impressive bibliography  of his publications and works. Design with Nature (1969) is his other  important book-to date. A tenacious survivor, he no doubt will yet fire off  another volley worth hearing. (Reviewed by Allan Shields in Ballast  Quarterly Review, Vol 15 No 2, Winter 1999-2000.

Thankfully, this is not a prosaic instructional manual--&quot;it is a book  about how books are designed,&quot; he cautions, &quot;not a book about how  to design books&quot;--but a medley of honest reflections about how book  designers see, think, and feel. Written by the author and eight other  American and British designers, it is illustrated by 110 black and white  examples, among them several pieces by Iowa-born designer Merle Armitage  and the University of Nebraska's Richard Eckersley, two of the century's  most inventive (yet unheralded) book designers. With surprising candor, the  text asks: How do book designers get their ideas? What do they worry about?  How did they approach a particular book? And what difference does it all  make? After all, confides Hendel, prize-winning book designs are largely  unappreciated, cost more to produce, and are rarely available in  bookstores. &quot;There isn't any correlation between what books look like  and how they sell,&quot; he laments. &quot;Design seems to make no  difference.&quot; Of particular interest is a section about the design of  this book, which led us to wonder how well it will sell, whether bookstores  will carry it, and (hopefully, because it has much to offer) the extent to  which it might inspire other, younger book designers.

While it is now common for printed books to include CD-ROMs, this one has instead its own website   where free software, called DBN (Design  By Numbers), can be accessed, downloaded, and used by anyone with a  JAVA-enabled browser. Using the book and website in combination, it is the  intention of the author (who heads the Aesthetics and Computation group at  MIT) that designers, even those who are &quot;mathematically  challenged,&quot; might quickly acquire &quot;the skills necessary to write  computer programs that are themselves visual expressions,&quot; and, as a  consequence, &quot;come to appreciate the computer's unique role in the  future of the arts and design.&quot; Unfortunately, the layout of the book  is so unexceptional (particularly the dust jacket, which might have been  used in a powerful way) that it is unlikely to convert any graphic  designers, who create far more complex forms intuitively, with little or no  knowledge of programming. As a result, it may only reach those who need it  least, meaning those who are already straddling the line between art and  mathematics, between graphic design and computer programming.

It is said that he  always decided the site before considering a building's style, its spatial  orientation, or the materials with which to build it. Of all his projects,  there may be no better example of that than Fallingwater (c. 1938), a small  but elaborate home in the woods (commissioned by a wealthy Pittsburgh  department store owner named Edgar J. Kaufmann) in which the building is  embedded in the landscape, making it inseparable from the waterfall, woods,  and cantilevered rock ledges of its location. While much has been written  about Fallingwater as a completed structure, less has been said about its  preparatory drawings, the friendship between merchant prince and master  builder, and the dozen projects that Wright and the Kaufmanns intended to  build (few of which were ever realized) from 1934 until the architect's  death in 1959. This is the full-color catalog for an exhibition of fifty of  the more than 600 Wright drawings for projects commissioned by Kaufmann,  which opened on 10 April and continues through 3 October 1999 at the Heinz  Architectural Center at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.

Reestablished after World War I at the University of Berlin, it flourished  from the 1930s into the 1960s, then faded as its leaders aged and its major  findings were absorbed by mainstream psychology. Today, the only surviving  Berlin-trained gestaltist is the 95-year-old art theorist Rudolf Arnheim  (author of Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye),  who is still actively writing. Gestalt theory was and is important to  different people for different reasons. In German, the word for  &quot;design&quot; is gestalt, and one reason for its appeal to artists,  architects, and graphic designers is that it provides scientific validation  of age-old esthetic principles. For those who have gained from gestalt  theory, whether artists, scientists, or psychologists, this is an  invaluable, interesting book. As the first comprehensive history of the  movement, it covers a wide range of material, beginning at the turn of the  century with Carl Stumpf, Christian von Ehrenfels, and others who set the  stage; moving on to the Berlin Psychological Institute, and the numerous  teachers and students who left before and during World War II; and  concluding in the 1960s, when Germany was still divided, with the fate of  the few who preferred to remain.

Twenty years later, Ruskin's remark  inspired the Aesthetic Movement (&quot;Art for art's sake&quot;), of which  the chief proponents were the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde and the American  painter James A.M. Whistler. Wilde sometimes wore a sunflower in his lapel;  and Whistler, as is documented in this thoroughly researched and richly  illustrated volume (with 250 illustrations, nearly half in color), created  an opulent dining room for London businessman Frederick Leyland, with  peacocks as the main motif. Completed amid controversy in 1877, Harmony in  Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room was dismantled and sold after Leyland's  death, and, in 1923, reconstructed in the U.S. at the Freer Gallery of Art,  a branch of the Smithsonian Institution, where it remains on view. A key  event in design history, it was restored physically in 1989 through 1992;  and now this book restores it historically, thereby &quot;dispelling some  of the myths and misconceptions that had settled over the story like  mantles of aging varnish.&quot; As a cultural biography, the book's  greatest virtue is its breadth of focus: Just as Whistler's interior served  as an elaborate setting for Leyland's Chinese porcelain collection, Merrill  provides a rich wide factual setting for the Peacock Room.

In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry made his famous expedition to  Japan, which had been isolated for 250 years, and set up trade agreements.  Examples of Western technology (locomotive, telegraph, camera) were given  to the Japanese, and Japanese artifacts to Westerners. Of particular impact  were Japanese woodcuts of the 17th through 19th centuries, called ukiyo-e  or images of &quot;the floating world,&quot; tens of thousands of which  ended up in museum collections throughout the world. Many (perhaps most)  American and European artists and designers were influenced by the  then-strange stylistic traits of these prints (crisp black outlines, bold  flat areas of color, asymmetrical arrangements, and dramatic cropping),  among them such people as Whistler, Manet, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec,  Gauguin, Aubrey Beardsley, and Frank Lloyd Wright. &quot;All my work,&quot;  wrote Vincent van Gogh to his brother, &quot;is in a way founded on  Japanese art.&quot; This stunning volume is a full-color treasury of 130 of  those woodcuts (introduced and annotated by scholars) from the many now in  the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

This is the full-color  catalog of a 1996-1997 exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London of more  than 200 examples of artdrawings, paintings (some using &quot;body  color&quot;), collages, and sculptureproduced by mental patients in  European psychiatric hospitals. The full collection, which includes nearly  5,000 items from the period of about 1890 to 1920, was named after Hans  Prinzhorn (1886-1933), a German art historian and psychiatrist who did not  initiate the collection, but was largely responsible for its promotion,  use, and preservation. He became famous overnight when he published a book  in 1922 titled Artistry of the Mentally Ill, which praised the  &quot;authenticity&quot; and &quot;primordiality&quot; of psychotic  self-expression. It attracted the attention of many Modern artists,  especially Surrealists and Expressionists, and was used by the Nazis as  proof of the underlying sickness of what they condemned publicly in 1937 as  &quot;degenerate art.&quot; Suppressed but thankfully not destroyed, the  Prinzhorn Collection was stacked in a cupboard until the early 1970s, and  has now been restored. These haunting yet fascinating inventions, all  beautifully reproduced, are prefaced by scholarly essays about Prinzhorn,  psychotic expression, and social conditions in Europe between the wars.

She was also the most gifted member of an amazing family of  artists, led by her father, the painter Raymond Bonheur, who (like Charles  Willson Peale) set up an artistic workshop in which four of his children  (Rosa, Auguste, Isidore, and Juliette) were trained in the manner of  Renaissance artists. But all that is long forgotten, and if anyone today  has heard of Rosa Bonheur, it is inevitably because of her finest and most  famous painting, The Horse Fair (1853). Purchased by Cornelius Vanderbilt,  it was brought to the U.S. (where her artistic abilities and personality  &quot;meshed with American interest in innovation and bravura&quot;) and  now hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Among  Leonardos notebook drawings, there is a tiny self-portrait (c. 1510) in  which he is shown using a squared-off and window-like drawing device  (sometimes called Albertis veil), four variations of which were depicted  15 years later in a famous series of woodcuts by German artist Albrecht  Drer. This current publication is not only an introduction to perspective  in book form but also a kit-like collection of tools to use in exploring  for oneself its history, theory, and application. Among those tools are an  acetate drawing window (like Leonardos), two draftsmans nets (like that  portrayed in Durers prints), various measuring devices, pads of gridded  drawing paper, and a cut-out with which one can easily make a  three-dimensional model of Dutch artist M.C. Eschers impossible triangle  (a well-known illusion that appears to violate certain spatial principles).  Experimenting with the devices in this box could result in a deeper  understanding of perspective, especially if one were to read at the same  time an earlier, richer and far more interesting book on the same subject  from the same publishers Eyewitness Art series: Alison Cole, Perspective  (Dorling Kindersley, 1992).

In part this is because so much of what we practice is unspoken and intuitive, while teaching requires a certain  explicitness and may be most effective when the essence of a subject is  portrayed in a simple, impassioned, and powerful way. As a result, one can  often learn a lot from brief, introductory overviews of a subject, as is  the intention of this attractive, large-format picture book. Several years  ago, the author (who is head of the education division at Christies) wrote  Annotated Art (1994), a companion volume in which diagrams, close-ups, and  marginal notes were used to analyze 45 key paintings; and, since then, a  similar book was produced by the same publisher about the history of  architecture (Neil Stevenson, Architecture (1997)). In this third volume in  the series, 50 more paintings (different from those in the earlier book),  are arranged chronologically, displayed, and discussed in annotations,  using introductory paragraphs, marginal notes, biographical highlights,  related works, quotes by and about the artists, and short lists of non-art  concurrent events. While the result is necessarily superficial, it is also  a welcoming, valuable way to be introduced to art history. (Review from  Ballast Quarterly Review, Vol 14 No 2, Winter 1998-99)	1999-03-29

Haldane was asked what could be inferred about the Almighty from a lifelong study of nature, he replied (given that there are 400,000 species of beetles, compared with only 8,000 species of  mammals) that God must have an inordinate fondness for beetles. If  beetles and other insects are so abundant, why doesnt everyone eat bugs  instead of plants, fish, birds, and chemically-fattened mammals? As  explained in this prankish yet valuable guide to entomophagy (Latin for  bug-eating), we already eat insects, inadvertently, in the sense that the  FDAs food safety regulations allow up to 60 aphids in 3 1/2 ounces of  frozen broccoli, 74 mites in 100 grams of canned mushrooms, and so on. They  cant be completely kept out of our food, and, so long as we dont know  were eating them, theyre not only tasty, theyre rich in nutrients (a  grasshopper, for example, is more than 20 per cent protein, and crickets  are an excellent source of calcium). This parody of a typical cookbook  concludes with a 3-page list of suppliers of edible anthropods (whether  live or ready to serve), manufacturers of exotic toothpicks, and  organizations that sponsor bug-eating extravaganzas. The author, who has a  weakness for bad puns (among his recipes are Party Pupae, Three Bee  Salad, Pest-O, and Fried Green Tomato Horn Worm), has written such  earlier popular books as The Compleat Cockroach and Field Guide to the Slug  (which the New York Times described as gripping).

The result, which interweaves  an astonishing amount of text with hundreds (maybe thousands) of  black-and-white illustrations (of mixed quality), is easily enough to fill  two or three volumes. The first 270 pages consist of 20 chapters with such  general headings as Readability and Legibility, Typographic Hierarchy,  and The Grid Structure. Within each chapter, there are a dozen or more  subsections on such topics as Designing with Two Families of Type,  Letterspacing and Its Effect on Readability, and Color Symbolism Through  Time. Intended to function also as a type specimen book, it ends with 75  pages of type samples, while, throughout the volume, the texts on the pages  are purposely set in varying type styles, with annotations about typeface,  size, and leading. How admirable to have put all this information under one  cover. Yet, sadly, it suffers the critical flaw that, too often, the  typography and layout of the book contradict its own principles. For  example, nearly all the text is set in 8.5 point type with 12 point  leading, regardless of typeface. While convenient for type comparisons, the  effect of this is devastating for the reader, since some type styles can  survive dense paragraphs at that setting, while others cannot. In the  books opening pages, the boldface, small cap headings for dedication and  acknowledgements are so small and tightly letterspaced that they are all  but unreadable. These strange errors, of which there are many throughout  the book, are not quibbles. The relationship between what one says  (content) and how one speaks (form) is essential in design, which is  largely about formand function, and, in the end, the book undermines its  own credibility. It is, after all, an arrangement of type about type, a  book about book design. (Review from Ballast Quarterly Review, Vol 14 No 2,  Winter 1998-99)	1999-03-29
