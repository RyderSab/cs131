The novel opens with the same hook that pulls  us into many of J.D. Robb's In Death stories; it opens with a murder. That, however, is just the staging ground for the wonderful work that follows and which includes so  much more than murder.<br /><br />As one reads on, awareness creeps up until the reader  is caught up in the wonder and horror of it all. How will we, as a society, deal with the actualization of the technology that is at the core of this novel? Suddenly, Robb forces us to confront the philosophical questions about the nature of being and the soul.<br /><br />As if that were not enough, we've also to deal  with how Eve will cope with the idea of family. In presenting Eve with this dilemma, Robb continues to develop Eve and Roarke as characters, to give them even more complexity that transcends their own immediate  relationship and that of the  intimate circle of friends. In a sense, it looks forward to the issue that Robb has indicated will never happen ... Eve and babies.<br /><br />The  verbal legerdemain, as ever, is part of this novel, and it adds belly laughs  in spite of the horror.<br /><br />All in all, a fabulous read that's worth every penny.	2005-10-05

I'm your basic novice non-programmer type looking for a career change. I lucked into this book at Borders, sat down and looked through it. Well, I came home and have been working my way through this book all night.<br />I've learned more about PHP and MySQL in about six hours time than I had expected to. This book is so incredibly easy to follow that I can't even put it down to sleep. So far, I'm up to Chapter 4 and going fast. Since I read the reviews after I bought the book, I made it a point to place a check mark next to each example that worked. That's all of them. So far, apart from the 'mydb' file that Rosenbrock used as an example in database creation, I've also managed to create a database for my movie collection. Next database will be my extensive library of books!<br />The beauty of Rosenbrock's book is that he teaches how to do the things I actually want to do. Also, he assumes a reasonably intelligent audience. Rosenbrock also introduced me to a little gem, phpMyAdmin that makes MySQL far less painful. I'd been sweating bullets just thinking about getting into MySQL. Well, I'm in it and relishing it, all thanks to Eric Rosenbrock.<br />The back of his book tells that the user level is Intermediate/Advanced, but I think that since his coverage is so painstaking and thorough, it should actually be Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced.<br />I'd recommend that anybody wanting to do PHP and MySQL. I've got to find out what else Eric Rosenbrock has written. The dude is terrific!	2004-04-20

Generally, I don't like Lori Foster's books, at least the ones I've looked at; they're usually, IMO, short on good story and long on erotic scenes. So, when the folks at The Book Rack in St. Louis recommended Say No To Joe? I hemmed, hawed, dithered, and finally relented and bought it. Couldn't have made a better purchase for the summer!<br />Say No To Joe? is a fun read. Good story, interesting characters that the reader can actually care about and enjoy, good plot with interesting kinks in it, and good dialogue. Moreover, the story is well written. In my book, that makes for a hit.<br />This Lori Foster book is a definite keeper!	2003-08-21
US	52803292	R2X33J78JDRG1G	0425190102	216335823	Hot Pink	Books	1	8	9	N	N	Cool Pink!	It pains me to give a Susan Johnson book a one-star rating, but this book deserves it. Hot it ain't. Plot there isn't; in fact, the story is just peripatetic, wandering from point A to point B, with an antagonist who folds like a really band hand in a high stakes poker game.<br />The story line is credible but not very interesting; one gets the idea that the hero and heroine finally get their act together when nothing else can be done with the story line. There's no real tension, no real sturm und drang, no real anything that makes a Susan Johnson novel spectacular. The characters aren't particularly interesting, and their romantic situation is rather trite. All it took to solve the big issue in the story was a little honesty. Quite frankly, sex scenes weren't enough to carry the story, and they should not be.<br />If Blonde Heat was a fun summer read last year; Hot Pink isn't, this year. Blonde Heat was funny. Hot Pink isn't. More than that, the female protagonist of Blonde Heat pretty much kept herself to the same guy, and the one in Hot Pink was more free with her favors. That makes highly questionable the whole idea of true love at the end. Maybe she was compartmentalizing, who knows.<br />All I know is this, reading this book at Borders was enough for me to know I will not be adding it to my collection of Susan Johnson novels. Come to think of it, I'm suspending my purchases of Susan Johnson novels until I see her put out good stories, like she used to. Thank God for soft chairs at Borders, until then.	2003-07-04

To some extent, it is in the style of Blaze and Taboo; however, it is not quite up to the level of either. The promise of the opening is not quite fulfilled as Lucy Attenborough is the threat that never really materializes, and the Empire turns out to be a caricature of itself.<br />The Flynn-Jo story is a good one, and the reader can sense the temptation to reduce this romance to the common denominator that many of Susan Johnson's last few stories, bar the previous, have been. Temptation, notwithstanding, Johnson doesn't succumb, so there is actually a plot and a weaving in of this story with Blaze, Silver Flame, and the others of that set.<br />Force of Nature is a pleasant surprise and a good reminder that Susan Johnson still has what it takes to write a story with a plot and interesting characters that one can care about. Flynn Ito is a wonderfully reluctant and weary warrior, and that helps Force of Nature to fit into the the Braddock-Black storyline and even answers questions the reader might have about why do Flynn and Jo never appear in any of the other stories. Jo's character is consistent with that of the other women in the Braddock-Black series. She's a strong-minded career woman who is not shy about going after what she wants. Are they likeable characters? Yes, they are. Are they as memorable as previous Braddock-Black series characters? Not quite. Even though Jo and Flynn have a crisis towards the end of the novel, the distress they face as a result of the contributing circumstance could easily have been avoided. In that respect, it seems artificial.<br />The novel is a good one for those who like Susan Johnson, and I do. Worth the price? As proof that Susan Johnson is on the way back, it most definitely is. Buy it, read it, enjoy it.	2003-02-20
US	52803292	R3U5XD5NGCSW7J	0399148248	358896248	Midnight Bayou	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Scary fun	This novel scared the stuffing out of me. It was an excellent read which evoked memories of other such houses that I've been in. In terms of plot and characterization, Midnight Bayou has lots of wonderful tension. The significant thing about this novel, IMO, is the amount one empathizes with the fictional situation and characters. One feels the hatred, the horror, the sadness, the revulsion, the longing for a parent/daughter to be better and different, and the disappointment that that person will never be. It's an ineffably sad feeling that that last evokes. The ending of Midnight Bayou didn't appeal to me cuz I'm not a believer in reincarnation (no, I'm not selling out the ending). That I don't believe in reincarnation doesn't affect the credibility of seemingly-reincarnative events which occurred in the novel. Strange things happen in life, especially with the supernatural, and what NR described is a distinct possibility. Midnight Bayou is a great read.	2002-12-24

It's a small book and is relatively easy for students to read, and they generally like it. Solzhenitsyn's One Day is a survival manual which exposes the horrors of the Soviet gulag system and presents human suffering under an oppressive system. One empathizes with Shukov and his fellow prisoners and is horrified by a system of government in which rule of man trumped rule of law. One Day can be read from a Christian perspective and ought to be discussed in conjunction with the U. S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Quite often, I've taken both approaches to it as a way of impressing how fortunate Americans are to live in a society of rule of law. This novel is good reading for kids from 12+, and adults will also find it enjoyable.	2002-12-24

Upon getting it from the bookstore over the weekend, I read bits and pieces of it at every traffic stop on the way home; took it along on a fast 5-mile walk along the River des Peres; and almost took it in to the shower with me.<br />From the first word to the last word, J. D. Robb weaves a story that is astonishingly good. It's a tale of a virus that can be transmitted from machine to man by means of sound and light. Provocative sci-fi fantasy only? The thing is in the realm of possibility, and that adds tremendously to the cachet of the plot. It is possible. For once, the villain of the plot is not immediately apparent until the end, and that's a departure from the previous ... in Death novels. The end of the novel is stunning! Eve makes the right media play and, who knows, she might wind up a captain in the near future.<br />Many of the characters from some of the previous novels are there, and so Robb maintains a certain consistency of character use and through that manages to develop further the characters of Eve and Roarke. There's Jamie Lingstrom, lovely cocky young thing; Mavis takes a brief whirl through with exciting news that sparks an extremely comical reaction in Eve -- will Eve be next?! &lt;ggg> MacNab and Peabody are there, in part as victims of the latest criminal mind. The reactions of Eve and Roarke to the situation in which MacNab is thrown is revelatory of the continued weaving of the fabric of relationships that is so much a hallmark of this series.<br />Again, with J. D. Robb, dialogue wins the day. Witty and character revealing in many places. Indeed, at times I found myself laughing out loud as I haven't since I last read the often-hilarious Geogette Heyer. Robb has that same laughter inducing Heyer quality, which is an excellent thing in a series so preoccupied with murder.<br />To say more would be to sell out the plot, and I don't want to do that. Would that Cahner's Business Daily would employ a review who has a proper sense of the series. Purity in Death won't win J. D. Robb any new fans? Somebody needs their head examined.<br />Bring on Portrait -- I hate to rush the years, but I can't wait for March to come! Great reading, folks. Enjoy!who has a proper sense of the series.

At first I thought it was more of the same -- one gets tired of the same worn, tired formula from a really good writer. It's a little bit more of the same, but at the same time, the book is humorous. It's a dreamer's kind of book. Home town boys who had crushes on home town beauties get beauties. The title is sorta clich&eacute;d, and I think that that is part of the fun of the book. I'm hoping that this book signals Susan Johnson's turn away from just the basic stuff to a story with more depth. I can only hope.	2002-06-06

This is the last of the \\"three sisters\\", and it is the best. Reading this book is like savoring an ice-cold beer on a sweltering hot day. It's that good -- to the last drop. Face the Fire has all the fire and passion that the other two were a bit lacking on -- perhaps deliberately so. The tension between the main protagonists is amazing. It reminds that sometimes old fire-sticks never burn out; they just smolder. This is a novel about choices, about making them and living with them, and about facing the consequences of those choices. It's also a novel about romantic dreams and how we dream about someone without ever considering the other person's point of view. What gives the novel its power as a romance is that this other layer of the dream is laid bare. This thread has been common to the other stories, but is more powerfully depicted in this last one.<br />For the most part, Nora Roberts' \\"witch\\" novels don't work for me. \\"Ceremony in Death\\" wasn't a favorite, nor were the other \\"witch\\" ones. However, Face the Fire works because it taps not only into the magic, but into the human psyche. How do those with special powers  function? In the final analysis, they are no different from us. The magic doesn't prevent causing pain, and it can't block the pain. So,  what's left? Dialogue. In this way, dreams don't crush.	2002-05-29

It's a thought provoking exegesis of the Second Book of the Torah without any of the historical critical analysis that so often fogs up Biblical exegesis. Since Jacob is Jewish, the book does not have a Christological and eschatological focus. Nevertheless, Jacob's comments provide spurs to Christian thought on Exodus. Moreover, ironically, many of Jacob's comments feed directly into a Christological and eschatological exegesis of Scripture. Where critics such as Wellhausen, de Vaux and others speak of Exodus as the compiled and redacted work of many writers, Jacob recognizes it for what the Book is -- the work of one, Moses. Moreover, Jacob's outline of Exodus is so simple that it undermines the convoluted theorizing of historical critical scholars. Adding to the fun, Jacob tackles Wellhausen head on and argues that the latter didn't quite understand what he read, but since he had an open mind was able to learn.  Jacob's work is thorough, thoughtful, and reverent. He explains the fine points of the Hebrew from the standpoint of traditional Judaic scholarship, and this opens fascinating window into Exodus itself. Jacob's Exodus has been vital to the development of the thought in my MA thesis. My only regret is that I must rely on a library copy rather than my own. One day, Benno Jacob's Exodus will assume pride of place on my bookshelf.	2002-03-21

Robb does with this book, and that's what her female protagonist, Eve Dallas, certainly does in a major way. The novel is delightfully layered. There is all that one expects from reading Robb's lean prose: the belly deep laughs her dialogue causes, for instance. Also, there are two stories developing simultaneously. There is Peabody moving a bit more to the front of the stage as a police officer and as a person with fine roots. Then, there is the main narrative which focuses on the murder. Both stories are well-woven, and both come up aces. Moreover, we learn more about Charles and Louise. What it takes to be a 25th century woman!<br />Curiously, though, the female antagonist, Juliana Dunne, seems to be severely limited as a character. This might be thought to be so when one compares her to that other excellent killer taken down by Dallas, Sly Yost. With Yost, Robb adds all these fine touches that makes him \\"well-rounded\\", one might say. Yost likes fine clothing, fine music, fine food. Indeed, for Yost, killing is a fine art. Dunne, however, is different. She is a colder and more brutal (not physically, but psychologically) killer than Yost could ever be. Where Yost has extra-curricular amusements, Dunne has nothing but herself. If she is a seemingly one-dimensional character I doubt it is because of deficiencies in Robb's planning and development of her. Rather, I think that Dunne's deficiencies are by Robb's design.<br />The ending of this book, oh, baby! It doesn't get any better than this. I won't spoil it, but the book's end brought to mind the review title [Good Job] which my buds and I think is a good womanly thing.	2002-03-10

The first time I read Forde's book, I wondered if it had originally been written in English or if it was just a poor translation from another language. Forde's message is basically simple, but, as with many modern writers, he appears to think that simple truths must be conveyed in the most opaque fashion possible.<br />Martin Chemnitz' Two Natures in Christ, written on a far more complex subject than Forde's book, is easier to read and grasp -- in spite of the complexity of terms introduced in the first two chapters or so. Why? Simple, really. First, Chemnitz takes the time to define his terms clearly so that the reader understands beyond the shadow of a doubt; this Forde does not do well enough, if at all. For instance, &quot;God does God for us&quot;; what, pray tell, does that mean? Here, Forde is restating the message of the prophets: God does as He pleases with our salvation in mind. With reference to us, it pleased God to send His Son to die on the Cross for us. Thus, Forde takes the very simple Scripture message and convolutes it so that the reader is not at all clear as to what he means. God forbid that those proclaiming the Gospel message would do likewise.<br />Yet, a Forde reader, who is not guided by someone else, is left to wonder what that obscurely nonsensical expression, &quot;God does God for us&quot;, means. That's the thing with Forde; he goes for the seemingly cute and the catchy expression without making it quite accessible to the reader. Likewise with &quot;discontinuity&quot;, one is hard put to find Forde's definition of what he means by the term; yet he employs it. I've heard two divergent explanations of &quot;discontinuity&quot; and am still making up my mind regarding its meaning as Forde uses the word. That is poor writing which has lost sight of its purpose of communication. Would that Forde attempted to write with the same clarity of expression of the second Martin. In fact, to grasp fully the turgidity of Forde's prose, read any one chapter of any text by Chemnitz: Two Natures in Christ, Loci Theologici, Coena Domini/The Lord's Supper and then read a chapter of Forde's book. Relish the difference.<br />Forde essentially says nothing new -- tell the story, make the promise; indeed, the Gospel has already said what Forde states in Theology is For Proclamation. Moreover, the Gospel has said it better and more simply. If Forde is attempting to aid with techniques of Gospel proclamation, then he has a responsibility to communicate by writing with clarity, by selecting his diction judiciously, and, by striving to ensure that what he means is what his readers understand. Theology is too important to be muddled by the obscurantisms that are the unique characteristic of today's scholarship.chapter of any text by Chemnitz: Two Natures in Christ, Loci Theologici, Coena Domini/The Lord's Supper and then read a chapter of Forde's book.

Highly enjoyable characters and more character development of the series' protagonists, Roarke and Eve; witty dialogue which sparks gut deep belly laughs; new story lines involving characters introduced earlier -- Charles and Louise, simply fantastic! -- good, strong plot; and bad bad-guys. Nobody does it like Robb (Nora Roberts). She's simply the best.<br />After Amazon's Publishers' Weekly reviewer panned the novel, I had reservations about<br />quite what to expect. (I think Publishers' Weekly's review ought to read the whole series<br />and think about things a bit more.) However, J. D. Robb does not at all disappoint. In 354 pages of enjoyable, small print reading, readers familiar with the In Death series are witness to Dallas' further development as a character. Those who are familiar with all the books in<br />the series will realize the extent of Eve's growth. She has come a long way baby from the woman who could not respond with other than silence to Roarke's expressions of love. Robb gives Dallas a richer complexity, a maturity wrought by love in this novel. I'm not going to sell out the storyline, but the closing pages of this novel are surely a testament to the depth of Robb's creativity and to the richness with which she imbues her characters.<br />In many places, from the beginning onwards, the dialogue is rip roaringly funny. Some of the<br />exchanges between Dallas and Peabody, Dallas and Roarke, Dallas and other characters, the Peabody-McNabb situation are so hilarious that this novel ought not be read in public &lt;g&gt;. Robb has more than a touch of the blarney in her and a wonderful way with her pen. Read the novel to find out how simply wonderful is its dialogue--in fact, read it at home so people won't think you're crazy when you burst into a belly laugh!<br />So often readers pay $7.99 for a novel and wind up wishing that they'd kept their money in their pockets because the story line dragged, the dialogue was meaningless, and the characters were dull. No one can accuse Seduction in Death of any of this. This was a well spent $7.99, and I enjoyed every penny's worth.

Interesting story; the protagonists were credible and the antagonist an incredible son of a biscuit. That's the nice thing about Johnson, she creates characters that one could either empathize with or despise. The downside of the story was that too much time was spent in bed; yeah, yeah, lots of action, but the narrative remained pretty much static then, unless one wants to say that those scenes were the rationale for the male protagonists desperate efforts on behalf of the female. Whatever happened to love being enough &lt;g&gt;?<br />As much as I enjoy Susan Johnson's novels, I really regret that she has so much infused her writings with the crudity that is the hallmark of Thea Devine and Beatrice Small. Susan, you're a far better writer than either of those! C'mon, girl, your books were good reading long before you had men talking to women as though they were trash; shucks, that's why I wrote you one year (about almost 10 years ago) when I was about to travel and wanted to give a friend my copy of Silver Flame -- and you were kind enough to call me and send me an autographed one, which I paid for after I returned from my travels.

Behold me, well nigh translated to death!	2001-06-01

I love Hebrew, but love not Waltke O'Connor. I don't know of a seminary  or grad student who does, even though we all recognize that  Waltke O'Connor is a necessary evil.The book is incredibly informative, and the other reviewer is right. You don't know Hebrew until you've  read Waltke O'Connor. If only the Waltke O'Connor text were less turgid.<br />12/26/03. I've revised my opinion of WO. Ach! The prose is still turgid, but it's the best Hebrew grammar out there. WO is to Hebrew Grammar what Louw Nida is to Greek vocabulary. I've got Kautzsch-Cowley, Jo&uuml;on-Muraoka, Williams, van der Merwe, and have had to go through them all. They don't hold a candle to Waltke O'Connor in terms of depth and helping one to understand the Hebrew.	2000-12-09
US	52803292	R35XDTCX92GFF2	0023672501	561027010	An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew	Books	2	15	20	N	N	There are other better grammars than this one	The best Hebrew grammar book for new learners is Andrew Bartelt's Fundamental Biblical Hebrew. Lambdin's book is definitely not it. In fact, I rate Weingreen's Classical Hebrew Grammar and Page Kelley's Classical  Hebrew way over Lambdin's. Lambdin's text is confusing and frustrating. I say that as someone who started off by teaching myself Hebrew -- Weingreen was excellent, and Kelley supplemented where Weingreen fell short. I do have the Lambdin text, but gave it up in frustration. The one text that organizes and clarifies in a way that neither Lambdin, Weingreen, nor Kelley does, is Bartelt's. That's the text for the Hebrew neophyte, either with a teacher or a self-starter.	2000-12-09

The dialogue is entirely centered on intimate activity,and it's almost as though the characters do not exist above the waist. The Lover is a derivative of The Lady's Tutor and A Lady's Pleasure, with nothing really new or different added to it. Worse yet, The Lover drove home the point that Susan Johnson is one of the few writers who can open a novel with a sexy scene and then capture and hold the reader's interest throughout. Why is this so? Susan Johnson actually dares to provide a substantial story.<br />It's been three days since I've had this book; I'm barely half-way through and can't find a good reason to finish -- apart from the fact I spent my money unwisely.

It's sweetly paced like a slow-rolling ride after the hectic madness and tension of Loyalty in Death. This is superb orchestration on J. D. Robb's part, letting the readers catch their  breaths, letting the characters develop, and letting folks just enjoy a  plain ol' darn good story.<br />Loyalty was explosive &lt;g&gt;, but this one  was warmer, more thoughtful, and more complex with the lines blurred and  the sharp demarcation line between right and wrong smudged a bit. Moreover,  Witness pushes Dallas, Peabody, and McNab forward, it reintroduces Charles  -- an entirely sympathetic and likeable character whose occupation makes  the reader wince a bit -- and through him reveals Dallas a bit more.<br />When  I was reading this, I was caught off-guard waiting for the sharp peaks;  gradually, I realized that this was a different story, the subtext of which  was that sometimes true justice can only be obtained outside of the Law,  and it wasn't going to have the riveting dramatic tensions of some of its  predecessors. Perhaps, even, it might be argued, that the climax of the  story comes at the end when readers are made most aware of the distinction  between Law and Justice.<br />This is a lovely story! Bring on Judgement!...	2000-03-18

Robb's thrillers are tight, gripping, and futuristic stories, all of which should merit her an official Amazon reviewer who has more wit than to spill the plotline. As a reader, who has been eagerly anticipating the next  segment in the continuing saga of Eve Dallas, I found it extremely  tiresome, irritating, irksome, and annoying (add all the other unmentioned  synonyms) that Amazon's reviewer, Nancy O'Brien, blabbed about what's, no  doubt, a key line in Robb's plot. In so doing, the reviewer took a lot of  the mystery out of Robb's mystery. There is a difference between an  incomplete plot summary and a review -- Miss O'Brien's synopsis reads like  a review, and her review mostly reads like a synopsis. Before she 'reviews'  her next mystery, perhaps Miss O'Brien ought to learn to distinguish  between the two.	1999-02-27
