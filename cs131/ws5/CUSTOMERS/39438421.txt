Julie Garwood, Sue Ellen Welfonder, Karen Marie Moning, ect. And I can appreciate all of the different tones or writing styles authors have without giving the book a bad review. I hate to say it, because I always get \\"flogged\\" on the voting button when I give a negative review, but this book was difficult to finish. It starts out interesting enough with Sophie's abduction, we really start to care about the characters, and then they get back to his \\"Castle in Ruin.\\" (Because his home has been taken by an enemy). This is where it starts to fizzle. I liked this hero well enough, but fierce Highlander he's not, which is okay, just a little boring. Our hero basically acts as a patrol, thwarting the efforts of the English building roads through Scotland. Running and hiding when these soldiers spot him, he comes off more as a prankster, than a force to be reckoned with. And the scale of the \\"Drama\\" is minimal. The climax reads as a minor \\"scuffle.\\" As for our heroine, I really liked her, but her character fell flat for me after we're told of her special \\"fairy\\" blood that gives her special powers, which she's not even sure of. Apparently, these \\"powers\\" differ between each person in her family, and all our heroine can do is encourage growth in plants and vegetables, even where land is virtually barren and without hope... Yes, that's it. It's not even like one day there are just rocks and the next we have a bloom filled garden, no, they're all amazed by a little bit of sprouting. Why bother, I kept waiting for something more, and it never comes. Till the end even the hero's not sure if he's a believer of her \\"Gift.\\" (Possible spoiler?) At one point the hero talks to her about it (yes, they only talk of her abilities once) and he tells her that maybe her gift prevails itself where she directs her love, that maybe because of her love of gardening, her powers are shown to her. So, then you think, \\"Okay, when he needs her she'll be able to heal him, orwhatever, because she loves him...\\" Yea, well, that never happens either. Like I said, this was boring and difficult to finish. I really hate to give negative reviews, but I also hope that by reading my review your able to say a.) These things wouldn't bother me; I'll give it a go. Or b.) Thank goodness, I can save my $6, and my time.	2005-09-29

With both worlds being very similar (King Arthur's Court vs. Greek mythology). The strongest contrast has to do with the morals of the character. I'm no prude, but with Kenyon's dark hunters, there's this inner beauty to all of her characters. As Kenyon describes \\"They're Mad, Bad, and Immortal.\\" They have tortured souls, they like to get down and dirty, and you can't help but love them. I have found myself in tears over the betrayals they've suffered and the purpose in life and love they discover that ultimately saves their souls. And they're all honorable. With Angela Knight's \\"Megaverse\\" her characters don't have many redeeming qualities in my opinion. You don't love them, can't relate to them. They come across as shallow, selfish souls. They're ruled by a \\"High Council\\" that has the power to end their existence with the zap of a finger for ridiculous infractions, like refusing a witch on her knees if you catch my drift. It seems to make the hero out to be less appealing if he can't even make simple decisions, without having to grovel for a favor. The only thing that brings these characters together is sex. There's nothing to endear you to them, which makes for a read that leaves you feeling kind of... dirty. These \\"Megaverse\\" books really shouldn't be in the \\"Romance\\" section. Sci-fi... erotica maybe, but not romance. I'm not saying that they are flawed in any way. Just as a matter of preference, I hope to help any of you who don't care for sex without emotion and don't want to waste precious reading time on sci-fi porn.	2005-09-27

This read is very similar in pace to Nora Roberts \\"Irish Trilogy.\\" While reading, you know that's it's a very good book, but wish for a little more...\\"Pizzazz!\\" I definitely related to both characters.

I have to say that, for me, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. JAK delivered on all accounts as far as I'm concerned. We get more insight into Ethan and Zoe's relationship, which is beautiful and steamy as they share their insecurities. Ethan having been left by 3 previous wives causes him to question how long before Zoe does the same. And Zoe, knowing Ethan isn't big on the psychic \\"woo-woo\\" thing is afraid that he'll never fully know/accept her differences. Previous characters share in the story but not the \\"spotlight.\\" That can be annoying, I know, but these are characters that you love to hear about and that also carry major roles in this Mystery and in no way detract from the story. I also love the fact that we follow a multitude of Ethan's cases. Some intertwine, while others are an added layer of interest. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this author, she is very talented. This is a romance/mystery mild on the suspence, not at all like Karen Rose or Anne Stuart darker novels. JAK is what she is, in my opinion always enjoyable.	2005-08-23

It just seems to me people either love her or hate her! I grab her books wherever I can find them, and they stay on my keeper shelf labeled: \\"Comfort Books.\\" Her hero's are very \\"Alpha,\\" and her heroines just hysterical! Joel has built the heroine's Uncle's company from the Ground floor and has arranged to buy him out, but before he can, Uncle Charlie dies and has willed his company to his midwestern librarian niece Letty. She feels this is exactly the sort of change her life needs. Joel's outraged but stuck with Letty who is serious about her new position in the sporting good company. Meanwhile he's in the middle of a revenge plot against an old adversary and doesn't want Letty to stand in the way. They have a bickering attraction to one another in pure JAK style. They do address each other as Mr. Blackstone and Ms. Thornquist occasionally, as another reviewer complained about. It's not that JAK is in the \\"Dark Ages.\\" It's all part of the humorous struggle between the two. Granted some of these books do date back over ten years. Along the way is Letty's stubborn ex-fianc who just adds more humor to the tale. This is one of my favorite JAK's. Keep in mind; it's just fun fiction! I'll even admit that I might slap a restraining order on some of her hero's if it were real life.  <br /> <br />So you know where my taste lie, it might help further to know that some of my favorite authors are Julie Garwood, Amanda Quick (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz), Gaelen Foley, Lavyrle Spencer, Dorothy Garlock, Linda Howard, Christine Feehan, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Kinley MacGregor, Susan Anderson, Rebecca York, Lauren Bach, Nora Roberts, Kathleen E.

Taking into consideration the time constraints with a \\"Harlequin,\\" I found the characters to be well developed and very likable. This is a story about a \\"hesitant to love\\" woman, and a man about to find himself on the opposite side of an attraction that he would normally lead. The way she turns the tables and uses him for a \\"good time,\\" it's absolutely hilarious to watch him flounder. I laughed quite a bit, and could have used a fan a few times. In fact, there is a scene where they dance... Well, I'm surprised the pages didn't ignite. What I love most about romance is the banter between the couples, and this author delivers!

The main problem for me was the lack of focus on the lead couple and the sad attempt by the author to throw way too many characters (mostly unlikable) into this book, seemingly to throw us off as far as the identity of the killer. It became painstakingly clear which family was involved, and between the killer's thoughts and actions, there's no need to read through chapters of the police trying to figure it out. It was torture. <br /> As for romance, with what few scenes this couple shared, it just wasn't enough for us to get to know them. And I personally don't like it when the intimate scenes are plied with four letter words. There wasn't much tenderness if you know what I mean. <br />I would recommend Anne Stuart in Romantic Suspense. She's an author that can make you anxious enough to wonder if you've got what it takes to finish her books. She has a way with the epitome of the \\"Bad Boy.\\" But Wow, \\"Into the Fire\\" well, I highly recommend it. Karen Rose is tops on my list of Romantic Suspense also. She's as close to perfection as they come with all of her books. Linda Howard will always be a favorite of mine, along with Karen Robards, Lauren Bach, and Jane Graves. Happy reading, I hope that my review is helpful.	2005-05-20

I bought this for Sherrilyn Kenyon's piece, and have to say all of the stories are entertaining. Am I glad that I read them? Not really.     Kenyon/MacGregor is an auto-buy for me. And while I enjoyed her story the most, I feel as though this \\"BAD\\" series in no way compares to her Dark Hunters. I know that they're two totally different storylines but, if I later found out that she really didn't write this series, I wouldn't be surprised. Not to mention, it would be better to just buy her \\"Born to be BAD\\" where you get this novella plus the previous two at the grand `ole price of $7.50.     After having read the prior reviews, it's funny that most people disliked Melanie George's \\"Promise Me Forever\\" so much, while I found it to be an average read. I didn't find the heroine to be a push over, and I didn't think the hero did anything out of character. After making a mistake he decided to rectify it. The timing was poor, considering it was the eve of her wedding to another. Nothing very memorable with this one, but that's better than disappointment, which is what I got with the third story.     As far as Jaid Black's contribution is concerned, while it was well written and will stay with me unfortunately, it was the worst piece in my opinion. Yes, we get lots of hot sex scenes but with no... emotion, tenderness. The world the author created, while well thought out, reads more like a nightmare that the heroine never really gets to wake up from. I love alpha hero's but this guy is just too much. The heroine is debased and humiliated at every opportunity. In my opinion, what could have been a very interesting premise, turned out to be a setting compiled totally for the opportunity to incorporate sexual situations that I found to be extremely distasteful. Nude women, captured, plucked, and sold on an auction block was just the beginning of the ugly mess. If you want to read great erotica I would recommend Lora Leigh and Sarah McCarty.	2005-04-20

First of all, the characters needed more fleshing out. The descriptions of their pasts are too slow in coming, and you never really \\"feel\\" their strife, at least not enough to endear you to them. The hero was wonderful, but then it's mentioned that he's 23. That number took the \\"man\\" right of him for me. I had to pretend from that point on that he was older. The heroine was different, running a ranch and ordering everyone about. It wasn't bothersome; you just never really care enough about her.    Second, we hear constantly the same thoughts on both their parts as to why they couldn't be together. I can't stand the constant repetition of feelings. It was 3 nights of trying to read as fast as possible to get to something good.     While this book offered a little of everything, all of the aspects came across as mediocre. Instead of a strong passionate love story, or a lot of exciting action, it's just ho-hum. Not a keeper.    If you enjoy Historical westerns, a laugh-out-loud one is \\"Nobody's Darling\\" by Teresa Medeiros, and for a more gripping read, anything by Dorothy Garlock, especially her \\"Wind\\" series. For something sweet try Julie Garwood's \\"Prince Charming\\" & \\"For the Roses,\\" which is part of a series. Also: Johanna Lindsey's \\"Angel\\" which is also connected to two other stories.	2005-03-02

It was very good. Instead of the usual sexual tension then climax of most romance novels, with this story its more of a developing attraction and two people learning about themselves.  <br /> <br />The heroine is learning for the fist time in her life about self worth, and the hero is coming to realize that he comes across harshly toward people, (though those who know him also know that it's all \\"bluster\\"), which has resulted in him being in the background more often then not. She's living in constant fear of losing her job by angering him or not measuring up, and he's hurt that she obviously fears him and shies away from him.  <br />All she's known in her life is a rough hand, first by her father, then her deceased husband.  <br /> <br />The relationship develops at a nice pace, but we never see the couple make love or get married. (It is obvious at the end that they will). And for the first time, instead of feeling \\"cheated\\" by that fact, I was enthralled with this couple and totally fulfilled by their outcome. All of the characters were endearing. I'm glad that I read this one, but I've not decided if it's a keeper or not.	2005-01-12

It's been on my keeper shelf for years, and after having read it for the 4th or 5th time recently, I thought I should review it. The constant draw to this and all other Amanda Quick (Jayne Ann Krentz) books is without a doubt, the characters witty banter and hysterical personalities.     With this hero (and with most of hers) there's an edge of danger, but never toward the heroine. St. Justin is cynical, mysterious, and compelling. He's feared and loathed by most because of his scarred features and largeness, also because of a rumored history of having debauched and then abandoned the town's rector's daughter.     Harriet is quirky, driven by her passion for fossil collecting and innocent when it comes to male/female attraction. But of coarse Harriett sees his \\"handsomeness\\" and is strongly attracted to him and becomes his champion. While they banter and discover each other, they have to deal with the hidden threat of an old adversary, and societies ridicule of St. Justin.     Every romance fan MUST experience Quick in my opinion. I consider her books \\"Comfort Books\\" and when I pick one up I know it's a sure bet that I'll love it.	2005-01-12

The way this couple meets was very fun and unique, but after that the story just reads like an episode of the \\"Walton's.\\" The couple is \\"sugary sweet\\" thru the whole story. While I've often wished with other romances for the couples to have less \\"Drama.\\" I guess now I know that it makes for a very boring read.  <br /> <br />I devour 3-4 books a week. This book put me to sleep 6 night's in a row! I'm sitting down to read for the night and am 6 pages from finishing this book, and I can't bring myself to finish it. I don't want to waste the 5 minutes, so I decided to write a review instead.  <br /> <br />What really had me boggled is at the point of the \\"Dramatic Climax,\\" there was absolutely no drama! Someone's life is at stake, and they're all just casually making plans! \\"Well, I'll go by the house before I set out to the rescue, want me to makes some snacks for the road...\\" (My version) I couldn't believe it.  <br /> <br />I gave this 3 stars because there aren't any major flaws, it was just so dull and mediocre. I'm sorry to have wasted the week on it.	2005-01-08

Great suspense in the beginning thru the middle, sort of loses a bit of steam toward the end. The hero was wonderful and you can't help but feel for him. The heroine was a bit ho-hum, not much depth with her. At first you love her, then it's almost as if you could blame the author for making you turn against her. She goes from strong and compassionate to simpering and immature. Not enough to make that much of an impact, just a bit annoying.     The author also seems to hint at a lot of things like her blood being the sweetest he's ever tasted. Are they drawn together by something more than just plain old-fashioned attraction? It's never clear! You never get a strong understanding of how these vampires live. It's as if all we need to know are the bare facts: yeah, they live forever, it gets boring, they drink blood yady, yada, yada. At one point when one of the characters is turned into a vampire, two seconds later he says, \\"Well, I guess I'll be going.\\" I'm no expert, but it struck me odd... that he might need a few pointers in his new \\"lifestyle?\\"  Not to mention shock that seemed more like surprise then instant acceptance!?     I wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one, but only because I have over 300 in my TBR pile that have been calling to me. It's a pleasant enough read. I just can't help comparing it to Christine Feehan's \\"Dark\\" series or Sherrilyn Kenyon's \\"Dark Hunters\\" series. Both of those authors have created such awesome worlds and their books are, well, better than chocolate! Really.	2004-12-09

Instead of \\"haven't or don't,\\" there's sentences like \\"I have not ever seen that before,\\" & \\"What do you think you are doing?\\" I felt as though I was reading a book from the children's section! Then my all time favorite: \\" He was standing so close to her, she could see the pores on his face.\\" Pores??? Not silver flecks in his eyes, or handsome smile? But, pores? The story is interesting enough, but not something that hasn't been done a 100 times. One good thing is it's a quick read, but I kept wondering if I should just stop reading and grab something else. I love Western Romances and was very disappointed with this book. If you like Western's try Dorothy Garlock, she's great, especially her \\"Wind\\" series. Teresa Medeiros' \\"Nobody's Darling\\" was memorable and on my keeper shelf. Carolyn Davidson is always a good read, a favorite by her is \\"Convenient Wife.\\" Also \\"Gunfighter's Bride\\" By Dallas Schulze, and Julie Garwood's \\"For the Roses,\\" which is 1st in a series.	2004-11-17

Garlock writes incredibly engaging books and has the ability to bring to life multiple characters (10-20), which is usually not as well done by most authors. Her villains are always evil and an amazingly accurate portrayal of how you would imagine people like that would behave. It also always amazes me that I read with interest just plain old daily chores and happenings. I do have to say that this story is not one of my favorites by her only because of the relationship development between the two main characters. It reads like an adolescent attraction. \\"He called me honey, does he mean it? Oh of coarse not, stop dreaming...\\" yada, yada, yada till the last chapter where they finally get together. I prefer it when the leading character's relationship develops more quickly, maybe get together toward the middle and allow us to see how well they get on together. Then work together to \\"defeat the villains.\\" With this story everything progresses so slowly, it's still very interesting, but it's mostly daily chores, small exchanges between the characters, interesting moments with the route 66 travelers here and there, and of coarse the confrontations with her \\"Holy roller\\" brother. If you've got the extra time this is a very well written, engaging novel, but not something that I'm glad that I spent my time on with so many other treasure's that await on my book shelf.	2004-11-02

I really enjoyed Hannah Howell's \\"Nightriders.\\" The character's, even secondary, were brought to life beautifully. The \\"Vampire\\" aspect was very much brought to the forefront. Suspenseful at times, the Vampire's showed exciting strength and abilities through a plot full of action and emotion. But, with the following story by Sand's, the Vampire aspect was non-exisistant. Except for the hero needing blood after a significant loss, the rumors the heroine hears about the \\"soulless Vampire's\\" prior to her arrival, and the occasional comment on how well they age, there's really no other examples of this story being part of a \\"Vampire\\" novel. Sands also fails to touch on a \\"mating ritual\\" that was very prominent in \\"Nightrider's\\" that should have been included if we're to believe that the two hero's are cousins and both \\"half breeds,\\" thus suffering from the same issues. If \\"The Highland Bride\\" had been the first installment, these inconsistencies might not have been as bothersome. It definitely doesn't compare to \\"Nightrider's.\\" To get the most out of this duo I would recommend reading the first chapter that introduces us to the two cousin's and their plans, then jump to Sand's \\"The Highland Bride,\\" then go back and read Howell's \\"Nightrider's.\\" You won't miss a thing, I Promise! And might avoid being let down in the end. If you enjoy the Vampire aspect Christine Feehan's \\"Dark\\" series shines!	2004-11-01

I even enjoyed reading about \\"Jack the Ripper\\" and not having to be grossed out. It's written more as suspense, not horror. I enjoyed every single sentence before and after the \\"love\\" scenes, but those really ruined this book for me. The frequency of the intimacies is not what really bothered me. It's the crude description. For example, the couple constantly terms it as f***ing, and it doesn't stop there. The experiences are mostly rough and just purely \\"sex.\\" If you're looking for a \\"romance,\\" it isn't found within these pages. The whole book seems to revolve around them having sex. Formula: something happens, they have sex, they're called away, have sex in the bushes by the side of the road, ect... I'm not really into \\"Erotica\\" so I don't really know what classifies, but that is what I would term this as. I also don't consider myself a lightweight. I've read hundreds of romances, from historicals to vampires. Lori Foster, Gaeleen Foley; they can steam up the pages! This book just disappointed me.	2004-10-28
US	39438421	R16SXSTZMAK5QQ	0759254036	440182168	The Ranger	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A good read, lacking a bit of spark.	I have to say that while I thought this was a good story, it wasn't near the best as far as historical westerns go. From the very start there were so many moments that I felt as though the author missed great opportunities. For example, the heroine was afraid that when they reached their home he would realize she didn't know how to cook, but why wasn't this an issue while they were traveling? We're just supposed to assume he took care of the chore? And the first night they spend together, Booooring! It could have been a great opportunity for some snappy dialogue, or...something! Not just \\"Will you go to sleep already?\\" There were also a few questionable phrases that I don't think were used in this time period. (I'm no expert of course). This book was a little disappointing for me. The Character's were likable and the story line interesting just not very exciting. If you enjoy Historical westerns, a laugh-out-loud one is \\"Nobody's Darling\\" by Teresa Medeiros, and for a more gripping read, anything by Dorothy Garlock. For something sweet try Julie Garwood's \\"For the Roses,\\" which is part of a series. Also: Johanna Lindsey's \\"Angel\\" which is also connected to two other stories.	2004-09-22

I will probably never give this author a negative review, but I will say that this was not a favorite of mine. While reading this book I was expecting a little something more. This story was written in a true Krentz formula, minus the mystery or villain. I do have to say that while I love \\"Alpha\\" heroes, this guy was almost too pushy with his seduction. Even I was a little nervous for the heroine! In real life I might have gotten a restraining order, but in \\"Romance Novel Land\\" this sort of behavior doesn't usually bother me. He pursues her doggedly, she feels wronged, manipulated and confused. Nonetheless they find a middle-ground understanding and admit that they were in love with each other from the very first. What you get with this book is a story about relationship development only. The characters personalities and witty banter are just a couple of reasons why this author can pull off so many similar books and keep her readers addicted. I missed the usual danger/villain aspect, but I still enjoyed this story. <br /> <br />	2004-09-14

This book reminded me a lot of Catherine Coulter's \\"Devil's Embrace.\\" They both seem to be controversial books, but with \\"Devil's Embrace\\" the hero does everything because he wants to convince her that he love's her, has forever. I think that the reason a lot of people are turned off by this book is because the hero's intention is to hurt and belittle the heroine. It is done well, in my opinion, because he doesn't hurt her physically and he does feel justified because she did wrong him. Stole from him, in his eyes, his child that she got by raping him. But his goodness is constantly shining through his gruff exterior by the little considerations he does give her. And when he does succeed in hurting her in turn feels terrible him self. When I read a romance I go in with the firm belief that the main characters are good people, so that is always in my mind when they lash out at each other, which help's a lot in plots like this one. This is a story where two individuals, that have both had a rough time of it, learn to love and trust each other. They were both honorable, albeit misguided. They don't know each other and think the worst because they're both lashing out. The story progresses well, and realistically. I certainly couldn't put it down until I finished it. But, it's not nearly as good as \\"Devil's Embrace\\" or its sequel \\"Devil's Daughter.\\" Warning: if you didn't like this do NOT read Woodiwiss's \\"The Wolf and the Dove\\" (considered by some to be a classic in romance) because in my opinion that man had absolutely NO redeeming qualities. And his treatment of the heroine and her family turned my stomach continually.     If you liked this you'll love: Kathleen E. Woodiwiss \\"The Flame and the Flower\\"(first in a series). Also recommended: anything by Dorothy Garlock, Linda Howard, and Julie Garwood's Historicals.	2004-09-08

I just love this family! Yes, there was a comical vampire hunter in Love Bites but as far as vampirism; she takes a more comical route, which is fun and different.

The First being she reminds me too much of Julie Garwood, whom I love. Sands has the same mood for her stories minus the character development, humor, tension, etc. In a way it's great to find a new author like one you love, the problem, I feel, being that they're too similar and Sands is found lacking. Especially with this story. In Garwood's &quot;The Wedding&quot; it's almost the exact same plot. Heroine waylaid/rescued by hero while on the way to be married to a cruel laird, whom also is a terror. A quick wedding...Just writing about it has me smiling and wanting to reread Garwood's for the 20th time. I don't think I could bring myself to reread any of Sands books. While I have to say they are good stories and I will read more by this author. I didn't feel a deep connection with the characters. It is as if they meet, put up with one another, have very few meaningful moments, if any, then on the last page declare their feelings and devotion. What I'm saying is if you like Sand's, you'll be kissing Julie Garwood's book covers.	2004-06-02

To sum the story in one word, it would be \\"vague.\\" Both Bree and Troy (the leads) were not given enough depth. It seemed as though I was reading the same basic, repeated information and never really got to know them well enough to like them enough. I also love paranormal stories, my favorite authors in that genre are Sherrilyn Kenyon (awesome web page [sherrilynkenyon.com]), Jayne Ann Krentz, and Christine Feehan, and so the paranormal aspect was not the problem. What really bothered me the most was I really don't think this should have been a part of the \\"43 Light Street\\" series. Other than a mention that she worked there and a phone call at the end, there wasn't any involvement with the previous cast. I've come to expect the \\"Calvary\\" of past and future characters to work together and solve the case. I gave this review 3 stars because the suspense was interesting and it was written by a favorite author of mine, but this is definitely a book in the series that if I had known, I would have skipped. Which is something that I consider completely taboo when it comes to a series, but this story was easy to put down and find excuses not to rush back to.	2003-09-11

Unfortunately because his personal character slowly declined, and his redeeming qualities didn't show enough until, in my opinion, it was to late.<br />Running from his family he meets Kate, falls in love, takes her virginity, then when summoned home by Mommy and Daddy, leaves her. Only to come back because he's persuaded by the fact that she's pregnant. This is only the beginning of behavior that I found immature and selfish. He had no honor and lacked backbone.

It was well written, just not my cup of tea. It did have all the ingredients for a great novel. What was lacking in the recipe was, well...a story! I love Romance in every form and fashion and prefer a good story/journey with a side dish of steam between the sheets.  This, in my opinion, was pure porn with a pea of something resembling a story on the side. My biggest complaint is with the \\"Hero,\\" While I thought he and the heroine were great all around, I couldn't help but hate the fact that all he did was think with his \\"phallus.\\" Which reached the point of disgusting on every level. From the very begining his sole intention is to debauch the heroine. Even in the epilogue he doesn't care what woman awaits him, though he hopes it's the heroine. And hey, my motto is bring on the steam, just give me a reason to read the story.  If you want steam with a great story try Gaelen Foley first, then Liz Carlyle in Historical.

I say that because the secondary couple, Olivia and Lewis Fonteras, seemed to me to have equal time in the story with the lead characters. Usually this would annoy me because in most instances secondary characters are never as developed, and you never get to see what really happens to them. But in this story I ended up loving them even more than the lead characters. There was a true love between the couple and a beautiful coming together. But with the lead characters, Dee Swann and Lucas Cochran, while they were wonderful characters, I was annoyed with Lucas. He was portrayed as being extremely selfish in my point of view.

I was kept guessing as to who the serial killer was, which is usually obvious. Which might be because I did take the advise of a previous reviewer, who forewarned reader's about graphic animal cruelty scenes in the beginning of the book, by skipping those sections of the story. I really wish authors who used sadistic villains in their stories would leave more to the readers imagination. I really have no need to be \\"in the mind of a killer.\\" Especially when trying to enjoy a good romance. But, after having skipped that bit of the story, I really don't feel that I missed a thing. The relationship between all the characters, first and secondary made this book well worth the time I spent reading. The story is very realistic, I kept thinking, \\"Thank goodness, that's exactly what I would do!\\" Unlike most portrayals of truly frustrating characters that never do the obvious.	2003-03-18

My reviews of this authors books are consistently harsh with the same complaints, but apparently I'm hooked. This book made me want to scream and throw it across the room countless times. These two characters were thoroughly frustrating! Come on! Yes, most people are driven to push each other away by stubbornness and relentless pride after a misunderstanding. But, that is the only thing that carries the story. I can't believe any two people that love each other as these two had, after having endured such gut wrenching hardships on both parts, would not afterward swallow their pride and cling to one another searching for comfort in each other's arms. They have an argument that lasts over eight months while confined in close quarters and never make up, never make an effort to speak rationally about any of their plights. It's a totally unbelievable scenario. No, instead they argue, and hurt each other throughout the whole book. I can accept a good suspenseful wait, but as they have the same emotional \\"revelations,\\" I kept thinking, \\"Alright, be honest already. And start going after those who wronged you, together, as a team.\\" keeping the reader up and down, then up again to no end, it's pure torture. Why not bring them together and allow them to fight their adversaries by each other's side. At one point, for the first time in hundreds of books I didn't want reconciliation. She seemed better of without him. He was portrayed in a terrible light. I have to say it was an addictive story, with constant turns, but only if you can take the aggravation.	2003-03-18

I really enjoyed the characters, first and secondary. Especially the witty banter between all of them. The only thing that was truly annoying was the heroine of the story. I can accept her history, but... I just don't think a woman, having been portrayed as such an intelligent and very independent woman, in her situation, would first off, stay married to the jerk. And second, be so blind to his character. Realistically she should have already come to terms with the fact that she should have gotten an annulment months before. At least she should have admitted it to herself after she meets Lucky, and not been so frustratingly \\"hard to get.\\" It only makes the story unrealistic, it doesn't enhance it one bit. I kept thinking, \\"What's her problem?\\" And when I found out, it still just wasn't believable.  I would have thought she would have found in him someone that she could lean on after being alone so long.  And the hesitation on her part to admit her feelings to Lucky and even herself was unbelievably prolonged for such a short story. At the end I said to myself \\"They were only truly happy in the Epilogue!\\" This could have been a lot better with a different twist, but I still give it four stars. Because the Tyler's are truly an interesting and great family. I haven't read many books that could bring tears to my eyes, and this one does.	2003-03-18

There were just too many things bothering me about this book to allow me to finish it. <BR>     <BR>One, most of all having been the heroine returning her girlfriend's kiss just for the heck of it. I was very uncomfortable with that. I understand that we're reading romance novels, but I think there are still lines that I don't enjoy being forced to cross. (Unless of course that's what the readers into, and those books should have big flashing warnings for the rest of us).<br />     Two, both main characters having intimate relations with secondary characters before they get together. It was weird. I had to refer to the back of the book to remind myself just who the main characters were. <br />     Three, Like another revewier, I didn't like the main characters much. I would have rather read about the secondaries, Riley and Suze. <br />     Four, the writing is way too choppy! It just does not flow. I'm a fast reader and with her books i feel like I'm constantly being tripped. <br />     And five, the Mystery/Story stunk. I didn't care at all about it, which is why I stopped reading on page 253! <br />     All in all I would say don't waste your time. I found &quot;Welcome to Temptation&quot; interesting by this author, but that's the most complimentary thing I can say about her. Her writing style is just to frustrating. If you enjoy Romance/Suspence read everything by Linda Howard, Cherry Adair, Lauren Bach, and Susan Anderson. Karen Robards tend to be strange but my favorite by her was &quot;To Trust a Stranger&quot;.	2002-12-05

The three prior short stories about the other brother's were very fun reads. I love romantic suspense, which at times can be very enveloping. So, for a nice light read, the short stories were perfect. But \\"Wild\\" took me right back, having been a great balance of romance and suspense. It's jam-packed with both. The characters were outrageously wonderful; you'll fall in love with both of them. One of the things I love about this author is you don't have to forge through a number of paragraphs to get to the actual couple's interaction in the story. And her books seem to make you feel like you've spent every moment of the days passed through the book with the characters, being able to learn about them thoroughly. I f you even half enjoyed \\"The Winston Brothers,\\" you'll LOVE Wild.	2002-09-01

Considering these are short stories, I would suggest reading them in-between your more intense, suspense books for a bit of a light break. The first, \\"Lake of Dreams,\\" having delved into an actual timeless love was very interesting and full of suspense. \\"Blue Moon\\" also had a bit of a twist as far as comparing it to the norm. The characters are beyond loveable. And \\"White Out\\" had to be my favorite because everyone's left guessing till the end. I would have loved it if they were all 400pgs. But they were perfect as they were. Having read the previous reviews, I just want to say that a book being a re-release should not affect the rating of a review. First of all it has nothing to do with the quality of the story. Second, if you haven't enough wit, before making a purchase, to look at the back of the book for a description to see if the story is indeed something you've already read, in no possible way should that be blamed on anyone but yourself. And third, I've always considered being able to purchase three stories in one a deal. Not having mentioned that the whole point of writing a review is to give us your opinions of the storyline, not the publishing companies! I gave this book 5 stars, because I always enjoy Linda Howard's books. And this collection does not fall short.	2002-08-14

I say fanciful because of the constant thought throughout the story of \\"that would never happen.\\" But it never ruins the story if read as a light escape from more in depth romances such as Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Susan Anderson, ect... (Which are some of my favorites). I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the sequel \\"Wild.\\"	2002-07-03
US	39438421	R15F5NVMDDHOO1	0671027581	305895234	Open Season	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Highly Recommended	I really enjoyed this book. It was a fast paced read. The banter between the characters was truly enjoyable. Along with fun secondary characters, and a good storyline, this is definitely a story that is worth the reader's time. I could have done without the last page and a half, which deals with nothing having to do with the main characters. It almost leaves a bad taste in your mouth after having read such a fun story. Does the author really want us to feel any compassion for such a sleaze, or even care about him in the least? Maybe I missed something. But, that's neither here nor there. The story was great fun.<br />Also Recomended:All Julie Garwood, Amanda Quick, Gaelen Foley, Liz Carlyle. &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot; and sequels by Woodiwiss. Nora Roberts, especially \\"Honest Illusions.\\" And new author, Lauren Bach.	2002-05-31
US	39438421	R2LN2ZYM9UT7AK	1561006238	347801275	Walking After Midnight	Books	3	7	11	N	N	Okay, but not great	This was a good book as far as action goes. The characters were well developed, but I always felt a darkness about them. Like they were both portrayed as some sort of misfits in society and, more importantly, to each other. Almost to the end the heroine refers to the hero as Frankenstein. First, because he was badly beaten before they meet, (which is understandable) and second, just because she finds him to be unhandsome. Once the bruises and swelling faded, I kept hoping for her revelation in finding him attractive, which she does. Only his muscular body, still not his face. And he's described to smell terrible from body odor and kerosene from the beginning, which is never remedied. I guess we're just supposed to have a very strong belief in love being blind. Every time they were intimate I had trouble suppressing my thoughts of how terrible they must smell and look. The action keeps the reader interested in finishing the book, even though I knew exactly who not to trust from the beginning.  And after the tenth chapter I was ready to stop reading and just putting the book in my \\"soon to be swapped\\" pile. This is my second experience with this author. I previously read \\"Wild Orchids,\\" which I felt the same way about. I only read this one because the author was recommended by a sales clerk at a book swap so I bought 3 by her, and am determined to get through them, so I don't feel like I totally wasted my money.   And what annoys me the most is the redundancy of the characters \\"feelings.\\" I continued saying to myself \\"Alright, I get it. She's scared.\\" It's unfathomable how many ways the author finds to say the same thing in different ways! I'm Giving this book 3 stars only because after all that annoys me, it's not half bad. I did finish it after all...	2002-05-24
US	39438421	R30H3SNQG829W1	044661114X	217054040	Lone Rider	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Outstanding!	This book was great! The hero, Dallas/Grey, was everything that keeps you turning the pages, and the heroine, Tess, was someone the reader can really relate to. The story developed excitingly well. Non-stop suspense will keep the reader glued to the pages. The couple sizzled; I can't wait for this author's next book. <br />Recommendations: Heartbreaker and Mercy by Julie Garwood, along with all else written by her.	2002-05-22

The setting had potential and I love steamy love scenes, but these were just...gross, frustrating and weird. Way too graphic for even this genre. And Ghost inhabitants that sort of act as narrators, I skipped those before I realized I was wasting my time with the book altogether. Our time is just too valuable. Really, skip this one. It was my first by this author, and unfortunately, now she's on my black list.	2002-05-20
US	39438421	R37JX2ASXYBVII	0446326925	466382943	Wild Orchids	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Good, but not great.	This hero had a lot of baggage, and I guess we're supposed to excuse his mean attitude (which doesn't improve much over the course of the story), out of sympathy for him. It doesn't work. The writer does keep you on the edge with the story line itself. I just prefer a hero, with or without past ghosts, to still be portrayed in a better light. He could have been abrupt and still have had a conscience. After the second time he calls the heroine a b---h, I knew what I was in for. It was as if we're never supposed to like him. And there were many \\"emotion\\" repetitions. Like \\"I wish I had a penny for every time he said...\\" This was an interesting story, but I did contemplate putting it down for something that makes you feel good. It's definitely not a keeper.	2002-05-19
US	39438421	R3VTOZT6T6VORN	0380802325	85428738	Suddenly You	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Good, but...	This book left something to be desired. This is the first book I've read by this author. While the characters were very enjoyable, and the circumstances of their first meeting were original and fun, for one thing, I felt like all of the minute things that they were hiding from each other, while getting to know one another, left the reader too much in the dark also. Which left me with the feeling that I really didn't grasp their true characters. And I should have, considering the story was the couple.       Maybe that was the writer's intent, because the relationship was the book, therefore the only intrigue that existed. Other than having sex with each other (which seemed to me to be 80% of the book), they went to a couple of social gatherings and worked. In a way I guess it's better than having to read through text that's redundant, too descriptive or just isn't relevant to the story. But, then again, I like books that have more elements, such as outside threats to the characters, a bit of a mystery intertwined, ect... When the story is left only to stupid circumstances or misunderstandings, I feel like I wasted my time.       I love romance novels. Julie Garwood and Amanda Quick are my favorite authors. I've also stumbled upon a couple new ones, Gaelen Foley and Liz Carlyle. While the relationships are progressing between their couples, you learn their pasts, enjoy their battles of wit, and become totally involved with the mystery and adventures the characters go thru together. This book seemed to me to be what some would describe as fluff.	2002-05-16
US	39438421	R11H6J28PTEUAA	0449006832	724584881	Kiss and Tell (The Men of T-FLAC: The Wrights, Book 2)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not a total waste of time	This was a very interesting, fast paced adventure. With witty dialogue and a good story line. It doesn't deserve a derogatory review, but...it was a little far fetched. Like an intimate shower scene a few hours after both hero and heroine are ailing in one way or another. The intimate scenes were nice and steamy, as far as the puppy goes, not even Lassie was that clever. The hero was good, but could have been a little nicer at some point. And the author constantly used slang words, some of which I haven't even heard. The inconsistencies could be annoying, but if read with an open mind, this is an enjoyable read.	2002-03-21
