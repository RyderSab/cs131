It is handy, appealing and very useful. I have seen it in a list of the top 100 non-fiction books of all time and it is also on the top of my list of aids to English.<br />I have yet to find an equivalent in the way the authors articulate the elementary rules of usage and elementary principles of composition.

This outstanding book is a rare gem that stands out amongst so many books on public speaking. Jack Valenti knows his stuff and demonstrates with finesse the skills and techniques required for successful public speaking. Even the experts, like Barbara Walters, are taking tips from this prolific writer and respected public speaker. His stories and eloquent illustrations are vivid and memorable, drawing both from his personal experience and real life examples of top public figures. <br />Valenti was a speechwriter for US President Johnson and is currently president of the Motion Picture Association of America. What can you say for a book that former US President George H.W. Bush recommends as a must-read for those who take their case to the public. This book is a brilliant achievement indeed. Once you start reading, it is hard to put it down. <br />Valenti assures us with his words:<BR>\\"Let us be clear: If you want to be able to rise before an audience, large or small, and speak to them so that they will listen to you, you can do it.\\"	2002-11-03

The narrative runs smoothly and makes for fast efficient reading. Once started, it is quite difficult to stop, thanks to the interest-enough storyline. The writing style is crisp and clear. <br />However, this book is no where among the great books for teenagers. From a moral perspective, the relationships among the teenagers are far from ideal and certainly not exemplary. Furthermore, there is hardly much in this book that caters for character building.	2002-08-18

It is both refreshing and inspiring to read common passages of the Bible again using the Amplified Bible. <br />For a sample of this commendable work, check out verse 11 of Chapter 3 of the book of Ecclesiastes. Eternity in men's hearts and minds is brilliantly amplified in parentheses as &quot;a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but God alone can satisfy&quot;. In a world where everything under the sun is a vanity and a chasing after wind (Eccl. 1:14), what an enlightenment to see that only God can satisfy! This priceless amplification alone should be enough to get you to the stores for this Bible version.	2002-07-28

For example, after reading the page entitled \\"Body Count\\", it would be refreshing to tell the kids (or even adults) that we are meant to be smiling rather than frowning as it takes just 14 muscles to smile but 43 to frown. <br />This book makes learning interesting and light even for the whole family and opens a world of discovery that would probably keep you smiling for hours.	2002-07-28

Is Isaac Newton the most influential scientist? Who is Tsai Lun and why is he so influential? Are scientists more influential than politicians but less influential than religious leaders? The fact that Gandhi, Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln didn't make the list should make us examine the list more closely. And the book certainly looks irresistible on the bookshelf.	2001-12-20

The prose lacked the suspense generated by more distinguished authors of thrillers. The characters were not adequately developed and did not leave a lasting impression save the victims in the first half of the book.

As such, she sometimes used or rather misused the statue of Jesus. She also did not have as clear a view of the church as some of us do today. <br />However, don't let her background hold you back from taking a closer look at her life. You will find her character, prayer life, trials and dealing with the self so outstanding and striking that they speak to you with great immediacy. Her spiritual experience is way advanced compared to her Catholic contemporaries. Hers was a reaction to the deadness of religion during her time. <br />The words of this woman of faith will force you to re-examine your life in the context of your relationship with and devotion to God. <br />Furthermore, the writing is swift, moving and true. The line of thought flows unhindered and appeals both to soul and spirit. <br />This is surely one of the best biographies I've read and I absolutely recommend it to any reader.	2001-12-06

Her story is brilliantly paced and laid out, making it a swift and captivating read. Her memoir, among others, deals with appalling emotional abuse at the hands of a stepmother, sibling rivalry, and the yearning for parental acceptance that are both poignant and compelling. Particularly memorable are characters such as Ye Ye, Aunt Baba, Father, Niang, Lydia and of course, Adeline herself.<br />A minor inadequacy, perhaps, is the lack of mention of the spiritual aspect or shade to her experience. Almost making up for that are crisp and refreshing Chinese proverbs that grace each chapter by encapsulating the precepts of the wisdom acquired.<br />This memoir exemplifies the possibility of rising beyond our predicament and the old adage that perseverance pays.<br />A narrative on Yen Mah's childhood can be found in the equally appealing book &quot;Chinese Cinderella&quot; which can be read by younger readers. Adults would find themselves drawn to it too.	2001-11-25

I absolutely recommend it to every person seeking to know God and His purpose.<br />I have 3 main Bible versions that I use: The King James Version, the Darby Version and the Recovery Version. I use the King James version for the beauty in the language and for correct pronunciation of words using phonetic symbols. The Darby version is very readable and has footnotes to names to describe their meaning, thereby enhancing the Bible narrative. Most important of all, I use the Recovery version for its clarity, accuracy and unsearchably rich outlines and footnotes that open up God's word.<br />While the outlines and footnotes clearly demonstrate the scriptural soundness, genuine quality and depth of the ministry of Witness Lee, they serve primarily (and I believe is the intention of the author) to help bring us closer to God and inspire us to love the Lord Jesus and His church absolutely and in a manner worthy of Him. God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church and even the New Jerusalem become not just something objective but real and very practical in our lives.<br />The New Testament Recovery version is certainly one of my most prized possession.	2001-10-29
