The conversation between Sal and Chris guides the reader to the truth of the claims made by Christ and orthodox Christians.

Reading the comments of some reviewers, one can't help but think they're arguing against Christianity rather than Kreeft.    Find out for yourself.  For a sample chapter online, simply perform a Google search of the words \\"Kreeft\\" and \\"The Bible: Myth or History?\\"    The book makes an excellent gift for a graduating high school senior or entering college freshman.	2004-12-28

It's a great resource for any Catholic home.      Though not a work of apologetics, it isn't afraid to tackle controversial subjects where the Church's teaching is clear.  Under the entry \\"Women, Ordination of\\" the following definition is given: \\"The exclusion of women from ordination is found in the expressed will of Christ, Who called men alone to be His Apostles, and it has been the constant tradition and teaching of the Church that women are ineligble to receive the Sacrament of Orders.  This is not a reflection on the dignity of women, but rather because of the relationship between Christ as Spouse and the Church as Bride.  In 1976, the declaration of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, 'Inter Insigniores', dealt with this matter in a detailed and authoritative manner, followed by the irreformable document of Pope John Paul II, 'Ordinatio Sacerdotalis', in 1994.  CCC 1577-1578\\"    Celibacy, much in the news in recent years, also is given thoughtful treatment: \\"The discipline of the Latin Church that forbids the ordination of married men.  Celibacy is perfect continence and is meant to foster imitation of Christ, Who gave up all, including the right to marry and have children, to serve His father.  A married man may be ordained to the diaconate but generally cannot remarry if his wife dies.  Jesus Himself (Mt 19:11-12) and St. Paul (1 Cor 7:32) encouraged celibacy, as did the Council of Elvira (306).  The Eastern Church allows deacons and priests who are married before ordination to remain so; however, bishops are required to be celibate. CCC 915, 1579-1580, 1599\\"	2004-12-20

Lukefahr's orthodox little catechism has proved to be a valuable guide to the Faith since it was first published ten years ago.  The most recent version is fully indexed to the Catechism of the Catholic Church and includes suggestions for further reading and reflection. <br /> <br />The advantage of this catechism vs. others available is that it doesn't merely replicate the CCC, but rather provides details interesting to the lightly catechized or new Catholic.  (Fr. Lukefahr's highly-recommended \\"The Catechism Handbook\\" is in fact an abbreviated CCC.)  For instance, in the chapters on the New Testament, Fr. Lukefahr includes the findings of authentic Catholic scholarship on the identity of the evangelists and apostles but excludes fads popular in less orthodox circles. <br /> <br />He also explains things like the importance of the \\"priesthood of the faithful\\" without diminishing the unique role of the ordained priesthood in the life of the Church.  Unfortunately, many other guides to the Faith either blur or confuse such teachings. <br /> <br />Much like that other master catechist Fr. Alfred McBride, Fr. Lukefahr purposely writes at a \\"Reader's Digest\\" level of sophistication.  At roughly 200 pages, the book is an ideal text for an RCIA class or program of self-study. <br /> <br />Readers can enroll in a free \\"We Believe ...\\" home study course by \\"Googling\\" the words \\"Fr.

As is typical of books like this, the author attempts to \\"horizontalize\\" the Liturgy and the Eucharist, falsely claiming that the Real Presence can be found in just about any congregation that calls itself Christian.    Moreover, despite the assertions of some reviewers, to deny Church teaching by merely asserting the primacy of conscience is to commit a sin against faith.  And the Holy Father has characterized our age as suffering from a \\"crisis of faith\\".      The Church teaches that the freedom of conscience, which, like \\"the spirit of Vatican II\\", sadly has become putty in the hands of dissenters, comes with the duty to form that conscience in the light of natural law and the doctrines of the Church.  Books like this one simply won't help Catholics do that properly.    Curious and would-be Catholics should buy an orthodox catechism like \\"Catholicism for Dummies\\", Fr. Oscar Lukefahr's \\"We Believe ...\\" or Peter Kreeft's \\"Catholic Christianity\\".  They can also pick up a copy of the \\"Catechism of the Catholic Church\\".	2004-11-21

Charles Connor of EWTN fame has written an excellent short book on \\"martyrs\\", e.g., witnesses, to the Faith.    Starting with an account of the early Christians and the dangerous lives they lead under Roman rule, he takes the reader through twenty centuries of Catholic history, with chapter-length biographies of figures such as Athanasius, Thomas More, Edmund Campion, and modern heroes like Jesuit Walter Ciszek and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.      Fr. Connor's specialty is English Catholicism and it shows here.  I particularly enjoyed the brief treatment he gave to Frank Sheed and the founders of the Catholic Truth Society and the Catholic Evidence Guild.  Sheed and co. would take to street corners and defend the Faith against charges leveled by everyone from militant atheists to town drunks.      I couldn't help but be saddened reading the chapters on European Catholics from the not-so-distant past.  In the now aggressively secular culture of Europe, Mass-attendance is below 10%, cathedrals are little more than museums, and what was once the cradle of Christianity is on the losing side of a demographic civil war with Islam.    But while the Faith is on the wane there, it's on the march elsewhere, growing by leaps and bounds in the \\"global south\\" of Asia, Africa and Latin America.    One of the key lessons of books like this one is that the Marxian view of history - that impersonal forces determine its course - is wrong.  With God's grace, heroes make history, and \\"Defenders of the Faith in Word and Deed\\" is chock full of them.	2004-11-06

Worth noting is the language and style used by the authors.  Canon law is often perceived by laypersons to be inscrutable and \\"off-limits\\" to all but priests, bishops and canon lawyers.  But Vere and Trueman show how canon law really exists to guide the faithful, and their jargon-free responses don't require anything more than curiosity to understand them.

I was especially drawn to its Q&A format.<br /><br />Right off the bat, however, I came across a fairly serious error.  On page 39 under the question \\"What is papal infallibility?\\", Pennock states \\"Only once in the last one hundred years has the pope proclaimed an infallible teaching.\\"<br /><br />Pennock conflates ex cathedra pronouncements with the infallible teachings of the Ordinary Magisterium. The Pope has the gift of infallibility whenever he explicitly defines a matter of faith and morals (usually by using the locution \\"We define ...).  So infallible teachings can be found in encyclicals and other Church documents that fall short of ex cathedra decrees.<br /><br />Since the book has the imprimatur of Cleveland Bishop Anthony Pilla, I'm surprised this error made it through the censors.<br /><br />\\"The Seeker's Catechism\\" also contains unenthusiastic phraseology like \\"The Church has taught ...\\" or \\"The Church claims ...\\"  Relatedly, Pennock lapses into distracting inclusive language, e.g., using the word \\"human\\" instead of man.<br /><br />Most alarming, though, is his depiction of Christ.  In the chapter \\"Jesus: Lord and Messiah\\", we are first told that Christ is compassionate, self-giving and humble, but Pennock doesn't get around to addressing his divinity until the last page and then only places it in a list of dogmas.<br /><br />Similarly, when answering the question \\"What is meant by the 'real presence'?\\", Pennock states that Jesus is present in the \\"assembly\\", the priest, and \\"the word\\", but he lists Christ's presence in the Eucharist - what the Catechism of the Catholic Church calls the \\"source and summit of the Christian faith\\" - last.<br /><br />If what one \\"seeks\\" is a short catechism that is faithful to the teachings of the Church, purchase Bishop David Konstant's \\"The Faith of the Catholic Church.\\"	2004-10-17

Regarding the latter, there's an interesting story to how I acquired the book.  I bought it on eBay from a seller who included the word \\"Bible\\" in his ID.  He sent the book promptly and in the condition promised, but he included an anti-Catholic tract that misrepresents what the Church teaches.

Structured around the three theological and four moral virtues of Faith, Hope, Charity (Love), Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude and Justice, Welborn's book shares four-page stories about famous and not-so-famous Catholics in history.    Each section features a short discussion of a relevant portion of the Gospel and then a series of biographical sketches to show a virtue in action.    The section on Faith begins with an account of the Incarnation, with its mystery described as \\"[t]he all-powerful, all-loving God who'd created the world was wrapped up in a blanket, being fed by his mother, and peacefully going to sleep.\\"  She then describes the Incarnation's four-fold purpose in language children can understand.    My seven-year-old son's favorite chapter is \\"Charlemagne and Alcuin\\", a story that teaches the virtue of temperance.  Everyone is familiar with Charlemagne's basic story line, but fewer know that the emperor relied upon the teacher Alcuin to bring education and learning to the empire.      What does that have to do with temperence?  \\"Both Charlemagne and Alcuin believed that when a country was filled with people using their minds in this way - for the good - that country would be peaceful and happy. ... The virtue of temperance helps you figure out how to do it: treating life with balance and always using the gifts God has given you for good, and not for evil and selfishness.\\"    The biographical chapters are perfect for night-time reading, each taking about 10 minutes.

Starting with \\"proofs\\" for the existence of God, he then establishes the reality of Christ's life and divinity, and then moves on to defenses of Christian doctrine entrusted to the Church.    Written as a series of essays, \\"Fundamentals\\" is a terrific primer on the Faith that doesn't insist you read it in one sitting.      Kreeft has a unique way of turning a phrase or skillfully using an analogy.  For instance, in his chapter on the Holy Spirit, he instructs the reader that the Spirit is a \\"He\\" not an \\"it.\\"    Is the Church an \\"invisible\\" body as Protestants say or a visible entity as described by Catholics?  Both.  The Mystical Body of Christ, Kreeft explains, has an invisible dimension and a physical one recognized by its four marks--one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic.    \\"Fundamentals\\" is also an effective apologetic against attacks on orthodox Christianity perpetrated by modern theologians and, most recently, by the likes of The Da Vinci Code's Dan Brown.  In his chapter on the divinity of Christ, Kreeft states the following:    \\"The first escape is the attack of the Scripture 'scholars' on the historical reliability of the Gospels.  Perhaps Jesus never claimed to be divine.  Perhaps all the embarassing passages were inventions of the early Church (say 'Christian community' - it sounds nicer).    In that case, who invented traditional Christianity if not Christ?  A lie, like a truth, must originate somewhere.  Peter?  The twelve? The next generation?  What was the motive of whoever first invented the myth (euphemism for lie)?  What did they get out of this elaborate, blasphemous hoax?  For it must have been a deliberate lie, not a sincere confusion.  No Jew confuses Creator with creature, God with man.  And no man confuses a dead body with a resurrected, living one.    Here is what they got out of their hoax. Their friends and families scorned them. Their social standing, possessions, and political privileges were stolen from them by both Jews and Romans. They were persecuted, imprisoned, whipped, tortured, exiled, crucified, eaten by lions, and cut to pieces by gladiators. So some silly Jews invented the whole elaborate, incredible lie of Chrisitanity for absolutely no reason, and millions of Gentiles believed it, devoted their lives to it, and died for it - for no reason. It was only a fantastic practical joke, a hoax. Yes, there is a hoax indeed, but the perpetrators of it are the twentieth-century theologians, not the Gospel writers.\\"    The book is vintage Kreeft and has earned the wide readership it enjoys.	2004-09-13

He explains that the central lesson of the last 40 years is that Catholics ignore the eternal truths of the Faith at their peril.   <br /> <br />The \\"progressive\\" secular culture that began to infect the Church in the years before Vatican II came into full bloom in the late sixties and early seventies.  It led to the creation of several generations of poorly-formed priests, bishops who winked at or even encouraged dissent, and a laity confused as to what the priesthood meant. <br /> <br />Weigel recognizes that priests are icons who stand \\"in the person and place\\" of Christ, and he calls for the renewal of a heroic vision of the priesthood to inspire new vocations.  As one successful seminary rector and current bishop put it, \\"a man will give his life for a mystery, but not for a question mark.\\" <br /> <br />Those dioceses that have earned a reputation for orthodoxy are leading the way.  They typically have full seminaries and growing priestly vocations.  Denver, under the courageous leadership of Archbishop Charles Chaput, broke ground last spring on a $4.7 million seminary to accommodate over 80 men studying for the priesthood.   <br /> <br />By contrast, my hometown diocese of Rochester, N.Y., has earned a reputation for dissent under Bishop Matthew Clark.  Not surprisingly, the bishop ordained only one new priest this spring to serve a diocese of 350,000 Catholics. <br /> <br />There are signs of a renewed Catholicism in the true spirit and letter of Vatican II: orthodox lay apostolates are booming, the new generation of priests is known for its fidelity, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church has been snapped-up by something like 10 million readers.  Surely, there is a thirst amongst the laity for Truth. <br /> <br />But problems remain, chiefly the abundance of weak, overly collegial bishops, an entrenched culture of dissent in many parish ministries, and several generations of uncatechized Catholics. <br /> <br />For instance, when Pope John Paul II issued the encyclical Ex Corde Ecclesia to reclaim the Catholic identity of Catholic universities, it was largely ignored by Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati-and he led a task force to implement it nationally!  Pilarczyk clamed that his own diocese \\"didn't have a problem with heresy\\" even though Cincinnati's Xavier University has two notorious dissenting theology professors.   <br /> <br />XU's Art Dewey is associated with \\"The Jesus Seminar\\", a movement that denies Christ's divinity, and Paul Knitter was rebuked by name by the Vatican for promoting an indifferentist, \\"any road will get you there\\" view of salvation.  (He too denies critical aspects of Christ's divinity.)  In short, they are the sort of theologian targeted by the encyclical. <br /> <br />Time is on the side of orthodoxy, however.  The old hippy creed of \\"never trust anyone over thirty\\" has a Catholic analog.  Young, faithful Catholics are steadily replacing their older, dissenting peers on university faculties, parish ministries and in the ranks of the priesthood.  What Weigel identifies as \\"Catholic Lite\\" is, thank God, on its last legs. <br />	2004-09-12

So it is.      Ford's questions ring true to life and his answers are always thorough, clear and orthodox.  \\"The Missionary's Catechism\\" also received the imprimatur (so it's error-free) and is in full conformity with the Catechism of the Catholic Church.    He peppers his catechism with a generous dose of apologetics that makes it even more useful.  As Scripture tells us, Catholics must always be ready with an answer.    Ford includes an appendix of answers to challenging questions often hurled at unsuspecting Catholics by the Church's critics.  He even includes a series of quizes to test your knowledge of each section.      Despite the complaints of nay-sayers within the Church who frown on the use of Q&A catechisms, there's simply no better way to learn the Faith.      Catechesis, apologetics, prayer, and spiritual guidance - \\"The Missionary's Catechism\\" is like a complete course in Catholicism packaged into one volume!  Buy Ford's book and learn better how to know, love and serve the Lord.	2004-07-05

It's an excellent resource for RCIA, group study or anyone who seeks a comprehensive yet very approachable overview of the Faith.

Since the book covers basics like Creed, Commandments, Sacraments and Prayer, the fact that it's pre-conciliar is largely irrelevant.  When was the last time you discussed the nuances of Lumen Gentium with an eight year old?<br />Each of the thirty seven chapters covers a topic like \\"Trinity\\", \\"the Eucharist\\" or \\"Incarnation\\" with a reading from Scripture, an explanation of that reading, a Q&A \\"catechism\\" and then a series of questions on what the student has just learned.  The chapters are about four pages long, so they are perfect for reading to children nightly.  <br />(Parents can brush up on their own catechesis by reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church and reflecting on how its passages elaborate on what is contained in the Baltimore Catechism.)<br />Book no. 1 is ideal for first through third graders, while the three subsequent volumes are useful for instructing older children.	2004-03-15

Karl Keating's excellent book is organized as a series of short, topical essays that respond to common misconceptions about the Church founded by Christ. <br /> <br />Despite the comments of a recent reviewer, the Faith described by Keating is \\"Biblical\\".  After all, the New Testament was written by Catholics under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit for Catholics!  As Keating points out, only the Church can provide an authentic interpretation of Scripture.  If the Bible interpreted itself as critics claim, we wouldn't have 26,000 Protestant denominations all claiming to be \\"Bible-only\\" churches. <br /> <br />His section on Scriptural inerrancy is especially valuable, and Keating correctly places the writing of the synoptic Gospel narratives in the mid-first century - within the memory of many witnesses to Christ. <br /> <br />Keating also writes in the true spirit of Vatican II, recognizing that the council primarily addressed the role of the lay Catholic in the world, not necessarily within the Church.  The attempt by many to \\"clericalize the laity\\" gets that teaching precisely backwards. <br /> <br />Buy Keating's book and find out for yourself.

One reviewer called it \\"bottom-up Catholicism\\", and so it is.  Revealed dogmas and doctrines like Salvation, Redemption, and the Sacrifice of the Mass are either left out or given false definitions.  What's the \\"Sacrifice of the Mass\\"?  The authors state that this \\"sacrifice\\" consists of the gifts we bring to the altar.  Missing is any reference to Christ's Sacrifice on the Cross - the essence of the Mass.    The authors cast doubt on the truth of the Virgin Birth - another dogma of the Faith, by the way - stating that in ancient cultures \\"virginity was associated with autonomy and did not have physical or moral connotations\\".  (If the word \\"heresy\\" just popped into your head, go to the front of the class.)  That doesn't square with history, the Gospel writers' accounts or the continuous 2,000 year teaching of the Church.      What's more, doctrines like the Real Presence and aspects of Christ's divinity are presented either ambiguously or unenthusiastically.  The following quote from the book's description of the term \\"son of God\\" is par for the course:  \\"[Christ] claimed that he had a special relationship with God - and that we all have this relationship, too.\\"  We may be \\"sons of God\\" by adoption, as St. Paul tells us, but none of us save Christ is the \\"Son of God\\" or, more importantly, \\"God the Son\\".    It's no wonder this book does not have the Imprimatur and Nihil Obstat, imprints that declare a book to be error free.    Skip the \\"Idiot's Guide\\" and buy \\"Catholicism for Dummies\\" instead.	2004-02-18

Thoroughly orthodox, their everyman's catechism performs a tremendous service, describing the pillars of the Faith - Creed, Sacraments, Commandments, and Prayer - in clear, often humorous prose.      \\"Catholicism for Dummies\\" clarifies misconceptions and false teachings held by many self-professed Catholics.  For instance, in the section on the all-male priesthood, the authors write \\"[Christ's] gender is more than accidental, because the Church is His bride.  And because the priest acts 'in persona Christi' (in the person of Christ) as an 'alter-Christus' (another Christ), then the priest reflects Christ to the entire Church whenever he celebrates any of the sacraments.  The maleness of Christ was part of who He was, and therefore, Jesus only called men to be His apostles even though His mother would've been a far better choice.  But if a woman were to be ordained, she couldn't be espoused to the Church, because the Church is considered 'mother'.  A mother needs a father to complement the equation.\\"    Similarly, in the section on the historical validity of the Gospel narratives, the authors debunk the notion that the New Testament is full of \\"inconsistencies\\".  Noting that Luke's \\"sermon on the plain\\" seemingly contrasts with Matthew's \\"sermon on the mount\\", the reader is informed that Christ likely gave a slightly different version of the same sermon many times.  Luke recognizes that his Greek audience is egalitarian, and so would appreciate a \\"plain\\"-given sermon, while Matthew's Jewish audience would have appreciated the parallels to Moses' delivery of the Ten Commandments on Mt. Sinai in a sermon delivered from a \\"mount\\"    True to the \\"Dummies\\" format, each chapter is self-contained.  So readers can skip ahead to a topic of interest - like chapter 12: \\"The Church's Stance on Some Sticky Subjects\\" - and not be at a disadvantage.    This book is an excellentcatechism for lightly-catechized Catholics, RCIA candidates and catechumens, and anyone seeking to know what the Church teaches.  Even knowledgable \\"cradle Catholics\\" are guaranteed to learn new things about their faith, as the authors include aspects of Canon Law, Church history, and overall instruction that are often skipped or skimmed over by others.	2004-02-18

Particularly useful are his explanatory analogies and defenses of Church teachings from misinformed and hostile critics.  For instance, he uses the analogy of a flower to describe the three theological virtues, likening faith to the root, hope to the stem, and love to the flower or bloom.      His chapters on the Liturgy introduce readers to a solidity and \\"vertical\\" dimension missing from the guitar-strumming, irreverent exercises in self-worship that many Catholics experience at Mass.    In a section on the universality of Christ and the salvation of non-Christians, Kreeft correctly identifies the Church's \\"Christocentric\\" view: one must have faith in Christ to be saved, but that faith may be implicit or unclear or unaware of itself, as is the case with a good, God-seeking pagan who is unaware of the Gospel.  He contrasts that with the conservative \\"ecclesiocentric\\" view of some within the Church who claim explicit membership is required for salvation and with the equally-wrong (and liberal) \\"theocentric\\" belief that all who seek God in any way are saved.     Similarly, \\"Catholic Christianity\\" is a corrective to revisionist presentations of the Gospel.  In the section on the meaning of the names \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Christ\\", Kreeft cites paragraph 549 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church:  \\"By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hunger, injustice, illness and death, Jesus performed messianic signs.  Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here below, but to free men from the greatest slavery, sin.\\"  Hence, the primary message of the Gospel is salvation, not the materialism that lurks behind some modernist, unorthodox views of social justice.    This book solidifies Kreeft's reputation as a latter-day G.K. Chesterton.    A suggestion to Ignatius Press: include an index in subsequent editions.	2004-01-22

(No first Pope, no current Pope--get it?) Being free from the Pope, apostolic succession, and 2,000 years of authentic Christian teaching would allow Mr. Wills to remake the Church is his image instead of Christ's.  <br />The \\"Church of Garry\\" would have no bishops with authority, no Virgin Mary, no Incarnation, no Resurrection, and no doctrines that bind the conscience of the faithful.<BR>-------------------<BR>What does it mean to be Catholic?  A recent piece from Ascension Press provides much of the answer: You should strive to know, love, and serve God the Father through His Son Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit (Jn 6:27, 17:3; 1 Cor 8:3; CCC 1). <br />You need to commit yourself to being a disciple of Jesus Christ. Since Christ continues to act in the world through the Church with which He is one body, Catholics believe complete discipleship involves adhering to Christ's Word as presented in the teachings of the Catholic Church (Eph 4:11-16). <br />You need to follow the teachings of the Church. This means assenting to all that the Magisterium (the pope and the bishops united with him) teaches as true concerning faith and morals and, by God's grace, living accordingly (Mt 18:15-18; 2 Thess 3:6; CCC 150, 892). To his disciples Christ said, \\"Whoever listens to you, listens to Me. Whoever rejects you, rejects Me. And whoever rejects Me, rejects the One who sent Me.\\" (Lk 10:16) The Magisterium carries on this mission. When the Magisterium teaches, it is Christ teaching us through it. <br />You need to receive Christ's grace through the sacraments. This includes receiving the sacraments of initiation - Baptism (Acts 22:16), Confirmation (Acts 8:14-19), and the Holy Eucharist (Acts 2:42)); the sacraments of healing - Reconciliation (Jn 20:21-23) and Anointing of the Sick (Jas 5:14-15)); and those related to the particular vocation to which God is calling you - Holy Matrimony (Eph 5:31-32) or Holy Orders (1 Tm 4:14)). The sacraments are visible, effective signs of Christ's invisible action (CCC 1113, 1127, 1129). <br />Finally, Christ exercises His pastoral and kingly authority over His followers through the pastors of His Church (Eph 1:22-23, 4:11-12). You need to obey their lawful authority as a way of obeying Christ (1 Jn 4:6). Following the pastors includes observing the six precepts of the Church (Jn 14:16): <br />1. Attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days (Ex 31:13-17; CCC 2180). <br />2. Confess one's sins at least once a year (if one is conscious of mortal sin) (Jas 5:14-16; CCC 1457). <br />3. Receive Holy Communion during the Easter season (Acts 2:42; CCC 1389). <br />4. Observe appointed days of fasting and abstinence (Acts 13:2-3; CCC 2043). <br />5. Contribute to the support of the Church (Gal 6:6). <br />6. Observe the marriage laws of the Church (Rom 7:2-3). <br />These precepts are all ways our basic Christian commitment to follow Christ is lived out in His Church. <br />It is important to remember that these precepts are minimal acts of discipleship. Some people adopt a sort of legalistic approach to such requirements and ask \\"What is the bare minimum I have do?\\" This is something like a husband asking, \\"How often do I have to kiss my wife?\\" This is not a sign of a particularly healthy relationship. The precepts of the Church are more like a sketch, a basic outline of a portrait of a disciple. It is the task of each of us to use the gifts God has given us to fill in that portrait with the oil paint of faith, hope, and charity, and make it as beautiful as we can. <br />To find out more about \\"what it means to be Catholic\\", skip Wills and try reading books like \\"Catholic Christianity\\" by Peter Kreeft\\" and \\"Living the Catholic Faith\\" by Archbishop Charles J. Chaput.  Or simply read \\"The Catechism of the Catholic Church\\", referenced as \\"CCC\\" above.	2003-01-02

Contribute to the support of the Church (Gal 6:6).     6. Observe the marriage laws of the Church (Rom 7:2-3).     These precepts are all ways our basic Christian commitment to follow Christ is lived out in His Church.     It is important to remember that these precepts are minimal acts of discipleship. Some people adopt a sort of legalistic approach to such requirements and ask \\"What is the bare minimum I have do?\\" This is something like a husband asking, \\"How often do I have to kiss my wife?\\" This is not a sign of a particularly healthy relationship. The precepts of the Church are more like a sketch, a basic outline of a portrait of a disciple. It is the task of each of us to use the gifts God has given us to fill in that portrait with the oil paint of faith, hope, and charity, and make it as beautiful as we can.     ** To find out more about \\"what it means to be Catholic\\", try reading books like \\"Catholic Christianity\\" by Peter Kreeft\\" and \\"Living the Catholic Faith\\" by Archbishop Charles J.

Here and elsewhere, Kung questions the validity of the Resurrection, the primacy of the Pope in Church hierarchy, clerical celibacy, and the sacrament of Penance, among other things. <br />It's no wonder the Vatican revoked Kung's status as a Catholic theologian for insistently denying papal infallibility and the full divinity of Christ.<br />Kung arrogantly would replace 2,000 years of Catholicism with his own vision of a congregational, protestant Church.<br />** Read H.W.
