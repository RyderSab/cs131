This is a very good book on software vulnerabilities. It's also very current as it examines a number of the recently widely publicized vulnerabilities. It also rightly points out the fact that Linux/Unix are not as secure as a lot of people out there would like the public to believe.<br />The ways to get around stack protection outlined in this book was an eye opener for me.<br />I thought I had very good knowledge of the material the book covers until I actually read it. It is clear that as software shops continue to plug vulnerabilties, people will continue to find new ways to exploit software.<br />Clearly, this book is not for the casual reader. This is essentially a book for people who have above average assembly language and c/c++ skills.	2004-04-08

Since I haven't done any really deep math since college (about 13 years ago) I decided to refresh my memory before I jump into calculus. This book is great. I haven't read it all yet but I believe I should be done in 3 to 4 days.  I'm not so sure that it will be that useful to someone who really didn't care for math in their school days. Such readers will need more time to digest the material. The tests in each chapter lets the reader know if she should move on or review the last section. Definitely a must have self study guide.	2003-12-25

This is a really good book if you plan to move from user mode to kernel mode. I bought this book because it was recommended by an author I really respect. It actually makes kernel mode application development look easy. I know that's a wild claim to make but its my honest opinion.The CD actually has a wizard for generating VS projects for kernel mode applications in addition to some really cool tools! The author also explains the skeleton code so a reader can easily build their apps on the foundation. The only problem I have with this book is the fact that its account on memory management is rather difficult to comprehend. I'm sure I would have been totally lost if I didn't already have this knowlegde. Readers who don't already understand this can consult volume 3 of the intel x86 manual or the book: &quot;Memory Management&quot; by Bill Blunden. <br />It should be noted that this book has very little to do with the win32 api. It is strictly a kernel mode/native API book so readers who have no interest in the kernel should not consider buying this book. I highly recommend it for system programmers who like me keep asking:&quot;How does it work?&quot;	2003-05-26

This book deserves a spot on every serious developer's shelf. It covers a lot of under the hood topics that are difficult to find elsewhere.<br />Even though .NET is starting to gain ground, a lot of the low level details of the OS have not changed and a good knowlegde of win32 can never be a bad investment.	2003-04-19

It includes questions I have encountered in interviews and actually came in handy when I interviewed for my current position.<br />That said, the most important thing a candidate needs to have is the ability to actually do the job. While studying this book will give you an edge in an interview, the candidate still has to ensure that he has the skills to get the job done.	2003-04-19

Once It hit the market for real, I got a copy via express delivery and I have to say it's worth the wait. I haven't actually read the whole think yet but its very impressive so far.<br />John walks  the reader through debugging without tears. This edition of the book does contain a lot more information and is very current (a little too current cos all the binaries were built with VS .NET 2003 which is not in the market at this time.<BR>However, this didn't hinder me since I have a copy of the RC. The first part of the book covers coding practices that will reduce the need to debug in the first place. The other parts of the book go into the dirty details of going after bugs with full confidence. From native win32 to managed code to multithreading; its all here.<br />If you're tired of scratching your head even when you have a debugger in front of you, stop reading my review and get yourself a copy of this book right away.	2003-04-13

While this book has a lot of good information, a lot of it is obsolete and you'll really have a hard time justifying spending the kind of money people are asking for it.<br />I have a lot of assembly books and I will rate this one as an advanced book but you can still get a good education from it if you know the basics of assembly language. In my opinion, the difficulty of the language is over rated. A great book to learn the language is : \\"Assembly Language for Intel Based Processors (4th Edition)\\" by Irvine. (emphasis on 4th edition cos it covers 32 bit coding)	2003-04-13

The whole .NET security infrastructure is really a handful. This book helps the reader understand what its all about.<br />Another thing I like about the book is the fact that it has short chapters.

In my opinion this man will be one of the best known authors in this area in the next decade. I bought this book thinking all I will get was details on garbage collection algorithms but the author actually takes the reader through memory management at the hardware level in an easy to follow manner. He also reviews how 3 different operating systems actually manage memory.<br />After this, he then jumps into the high level details of memory management for applications. <br />If you're a system programmer, do yourself a favour and buy this book. However, it should be noted that this book is not for the inexperienced. It digs into low level stuff and also assumes that the reader is fluent in C/C++ and assembly.	2003-01-14

However if you start wondering why your interface is not being properly marshalled, knowing your IDL will save you from scratching your head in biwilderment.<br />If you dont want any surprises from COM marshalling this is the book to get.

He also gave me a book to read. After the first chapter I realized why he laughed. This is definitely not an easy subject.But when I came across TYS DS and Algorithms I finally got a chance to understand the topic. I have a lot of algorithms books but if you have no experience and need to learn the subject in a short time, then this is the book for you.

It tries to cover too much so it doesn't cover any of the topics well.<br />In fairness to the authors they stated this in the book but what good does that do when you buy the book online? For an \\"Unleashed\\" book, this book just does not meet the bar. Having said that, I should mention that the book covers some nice topics and has some really useful information.<br />If you want a collection of white papers, this book is for you.If you want a comprehensive coverage of the c++ langauge, look elsewhere.	2002-10-11

Not surprising since it comes from one of the authors of the award winning software: \\"Bounds Checker\\"<br />I really enjoyed the chapter on x86 assembly. It covers what needs to be known to read through assembly code when the debugger tosses it at you.<br />Trying to list all the good stuff in the book will take more time than I can devote right now. What I don't understand is why the book is now out of print. I'm sure some people out there still want to stick to native code and these people deserve to have this book. I'm happy I got mine before it went under.	2002-10-11

No other book is needed to master ATL.<br />I have a good number of books on COM and ATL but getting  the low down on ATL starts and ends in this book. The coverage in unbeleiveable. It will make you think you were part of the ATL implementation team.<BR>This book is not a short cut for learning COM programming.You should have a good understanding of how COM works and you also need to know your c++ well(emphasis on well. This book does not teach c++)<BR>However, considering the .NET revolution, ATL may not be of much use for much longer.But if for some reason you need to learn ATL, this book is the ATL University.	2002-10-10

However if you are an experienced programmer trying to learn assembly then you may find this book annoying in certain parts.<BR>The book does not actually go into assembly langauge until you get past a good number of chapters.This may be a good or bad thing depending on the way the reader likes to learn.<BR>Personally I think teaching pc architecture before going into assembly langauge is a good thing but I also believe the author could have saved a lot of space and still got the pc achitecture tutorial through.<BR>The book also covers 3 assemblers MASM,TASM and NASM but sticks with NASM for the most part. It also covers 32 bit assembly in Linux only.<BR>Overall, this is a good book to learn the basics of assembly language but be prepared to spend money on more books e.g \\"revolutionary assembly language\\" and \\"inner loops\\" if you want to be a good assembly language programmer.	2002-10-07

There are chapters on Disks, Video and Bios/dos services.<BR>Some of the material belong in a history book but I found the book very useful in my research on operating systems.<BR>If you don't mind learning 16 bit assembly language, you should consider this book.

It reveals the nature of the virus underground and the deceit computer users are subjected to by anti-virus companies.<BR>I am inclined to believe the story this book tells because I came across the characters mentioned in the book in other more technical texts about computer viruses.<BR>The book is not technical in anyway so it can be read by anyone who is curious about the jobless dudes who write viruses and the anti-virus companies who try to stop them.	2002-09-26

However if you are experienced in c++ development for PCs and you want to make the move to the embedded space, this is the book for you. <BR>This is the position I was in when I bought this book and I must say that it was worth every penny. At that time, I just came off a (lame)testing assignment on a popular PDA OS and I wanted to know more details about Flash, EPROM etc.<BR>I also got the recommended ARCOM board. However, be warned that the price has jumped significantly. I also bought the recommended Borland compiler from ARCOM(I didn't want any detail to get in my way)<BR>The advantage of getting the board is the fact that you can try out the examples without worrying about portability issues. However this is an expensive way to go.<BR>If you are a brave beginner, you may want to consider buying the ARM evaluator 7 board which costs less. However you will need to use the GCC compiler for this unless you can afford the ARM developer suite(a 30 day trial copy comes with the ARM board)<BR>This book will definitely get you started in embedded programming. Its a small book so don't expect too much.	2002-07-19

There are tons of books out there for beginners and this is not one of them.<br />However if your are an experienced programmer and you care about how efficient your programs run, then this is the book for you. I have not read the book to the end but it has been really valuable. It breaks down different parts of the .NET framework and shows how things work.<br />I really enjoyed the chapters on boxing, object equality and shared assemblies.<br />It should be noted that most people will get by without knowing a lot of the stuff that is covered in this book but for programmers who are interested in the hows and whys in .NET, and how efficient IL code runs, this book has to \\"hang out\\" on your shelf.	2002-07-19

When I bought it I was just getting into c++ so it was kind of difficult but as I got more comfortable with the language I started to appreciate this book for what it is. This is a good buy for anyone who wants to go into ATL programming. I was especially happy with the coverage of connection points structured storage and enumerators/collections.<br />The coverage of these topics was a great help when I was developing a DOM and SAX implemantation for an XML parser I am writing.<br />However considering the .NET move in today's world this book may become a dinosaur soon but for anybody who needs to write ATL code, this is a great buy.<br />&quot;ATL internals&quot; is propably the best ATL book though.	2002-07-01
