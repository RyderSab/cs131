Topics like stack smashing, dynamic memory management, integer security, strings, and others are covered. The author is able to describe these complex topics in a way that is accessible to the reader. In my opinion both students and professional programmers should read and understand this book.	2005-10-12

Now Java has such a book. This book is fun to read and will challenge even the best Java programmers. Be sure to get the source code from [...] Study each puzzle and try figure out what it does or does not do. Then run the example code and see if you were right. If you weren't right, then try to figure out why you guessed wrong and figure out how to fix the program. Then turn the page and read the solution. <br /> <br />Working through the puzzlers is not only fun, but it will definitely make you a much better Java programmer and a better troubleshooter.	2005-07-15

The book presents key contributions of 15 computer scientists. While the book does contain some level of computer science speak, those who don't have computer science backgrounds will still find the book easy to read and follow. I first read this book when it was first published, and I occasionally refer back to it so I don't forget about all the great contributions made to computing.	2005-05-24

At the time I had a deep interest in all things AI. The book presents Dr. Hofstadter's experiences (along with those of his graduate students) of implementing creativity modeling systems (and others) at the Fluid Analogies Research Group (FARG). The book is not an easy read. The reader will need to be diligent and not get deterred. The book also is a bit dry in areas, but those who are truly interested in the subject matter will not mind, much.	2005-05-24

If you read it cover to cover and actually take time to understand any topic which you don't already know, then you will be a much better C programmer. This book is not for beginners or anyone who has never seen C. <br />  <br />My only complaint is that it is a litte out of date (no mention of C99 for example), but this is not enough to keep me from giving the book top marks. I wish the author (or atleast the publisher) would do a new edition.	2005-05-19

While this book is not meant to teach the C language to beginners, it is one you can keep on your desk and refer to, even if you are moderately familiar with C. If you have any questions about topics like overflow, underflow, and anything else related to standard C, then this book is for you. The authors explain the complexities of the ANSI and C99 standards in lucid detail. You don't have to be a compiler writer to get useful and practical information from this book. <br /> <br />My only complaint with this book is that the index totally sucks. Many of the topics/words I wanted to look up either didn't have an index entry or only referenced a page or two, when the topic was actually on many more pages. But this doesn't take away from the book, because if you read the contents, you can figure out where you need to look for something.	2005-05-19

While \\"Enough Rope to Shoot Yourself in the Foot\\" does a good job of pointing out trobule areas in C, the FAQ book does a much better job of point out more general problems because its content is taken from a newsgroup where real people as real questions. <br /> <br />The advantage to this book is that C++ issues are also discussed, which make it a good resource.	2005-03-14

This book does a good job of that. Other similar books (like the Scott Meyers' series) do a good job, but are geared towared (in most cases) seasoned C++ guys. This book is accessible to beginners, which is a good thing.	2005-03-14

This book goes into great detail on all aspects of the kernel. I would recommend this book, as well as \\"Linux Kernel Development\\", to be used as supplements to a college course taught on operating systems  where Linux is used as a reference OS implementation.  <br /> <br />The book does a good job of making complicated concepts accessible, but the reader may need to noodle over some concepts a bit more than others in order to fully grasp them. This, however, doesn't take away from the pedigogical nature of the book.	2005-03-14

It has the most clear discussion of design patterns I have ever seen. The technical material is presented with true wit and sarcasim, which makes this book hard to put down. It also has a good dose of general practical advice for object oriented design. If you are thinking about buying the \\"GoF\\" patterns book, I would buy this one as well and use it along side the GoF book. Or read this book first and then tackle the GoF book.	2005-03-11

When appropriate, the authors point out how Linux, Solaris or Windows implements a given topic. This is valuable for software developers who work on these platform and need to understand how the scheduler is going to react if you spawn new threads/processes.<br /><br />The one bad thing I can say is that some examples are too general and do not convey the proper detail. This is just a minor distraction and does not take away from the book's overall effectiveness.	2005-03-11

This book attempts to provide you with enough foundation to not only pick common sorting, searching, etc., algorithms for a problem, but shows you how to design new algorithms if need be. The book is an introduction, so keep that in mind. But the foundation it paves should last you a lifetime.	2005-03-11

Matt Bishop does a good job of presenting the theory behind computer security. He then provides practical examples based on the theories he presents. The only downside, if there is one, is that you have to have a little mathematical maturity in order to follow so/all of the formulas, etc. Those who don't care about this level of detail can still get benefit out of the book.	2005-03-11

This can help you understand some of the more complex topics.  <br /> <br />The reason I gave the book four stars is because the topic of pipelining as introduced in the book is confusing and may require most readers to go back over the topic several times before it clicks.  <br /> <br />I also think that having a course in digital fundamentals prior to taking a course that requires this book would help, too. It used to be that colleges would require undergrad computer science students to take a digital fundamentals course (or equivalent) before taking and organization class. It seems now that many schools have dropped the digital requirement and have students take one computer organization class. If you fit in this boat, maybe thing about picking up a Schaum's outline on digital design concepts to go along with this book.	2005-03-11

The book delves into some not-so-well-known aspects of Java. Unfortunately, the author's arrogant tone is distracting. I also don't agree with the word hardcore in the title. All in all, if you've only been working with Java for a few years, then this book will open your eyes.	2005-03-11

Don't mistake this as the book being lightweight. This book captures the essentials for using CVS in small, medium, and large projects. I've used CVS since  1997 in various aspects. In my experience, the authors present material that I've learned over the last eight years in an easy-to-read and easy-to-digest format. They touch on the basics, but the basics are really all many organizations need. I have been involved with projects where complex branching and tagging schemes were devised, which makes it hard to focus on actually writing code; you spend too much time dealing with bookkeeping, etc. The authors provide a no-nonsense way of using branches and tags that makes sense and is easy to grasp. This book is no replacement for some of the other CVS books out there that tend to focus on all aspects of CVS (administartion, coding, etc.) but if all you want is a great introduction to 97% of what you need to know as a developer, then get this book!	2005-03-10

The examples in the book are clear and easy to follow. The book also does a good job of describing IP fragmentation. I would also recommend that someone get Bejtlich's The Tao of Network Security Monitoring. Read Network Intrusion Detection first then read The Tao. You will be an expert in the area of intrusion detection and network security monitoring. <br /> <br />The only down side to this book is that not enough attention is paid to exploring the gory details of networking like Ethernet frames, IP/TCP/UDP/etc. packets. This is an important topic for security people to understand.	2005-02-25

Most college courses on C++ end with a brief introduction to OOP at the end. This book not only helps you understand OOP, but it has a good introduction to templates. <br />I would not recommend this book to someone who has zero C++ experience. Also, this book isn't going to teach you good programming techniques, etc. <br />Nicolai is a good author and knows C++ in and out. He has the ability to take something as complex as C++ and make it accessible to all.	2003-01-17

If you are a programmer who needs to use OpenSSL in a custom client/server application, then get this book. The code examples and corresponding text make perfect sense. The authors also go to great trouble to make sure you know the correct way in which to use the OpenSSL package. The book also covers using the openssl command-line utility. If you've ever pulled your hair out trying to understand how to use OpenSSL or have read the VERY incomplete documentation, then buy this book and have all your questions answered.	2002-07-08
