Beginning with the Detroit riots in the summer of 1967 and ending on Labor Day weekend, 1968, the novel covers a tumultuous time in American history where society was undergoing profound change. The story tells of the sacrifices of an ordinary family when their unbridled, loyal, and thoroughgoing Marine father is shipped off to fight in Vietnam. Switching backwards and forwards between the front lines of war and the steadfastness of home, Farrington weaves a narrative of longing and desire. Liz and Mike O'Reilly must cope knowing that there's a possibility they may never see each other again.     Using measured, eloquent and absolutely masterful prose, the author reaches into the hearts of both Liz and Mike, and exposes the complicated reactions to a family that is constantly living on the edge, and where tragedy can randomly strike at any given moment. Both live with loneliness and doubt and with the discomfort and exhaustion of battlefield death and life without one's spouse. Mike faces the violence of a horrifically misguided war, whilst Liz must cope with her own suffering as she attends to the needs of her four children, with one on the way, waiting anxiously for Mike to return.     The story is told from the point of view of Liz, Mike, and Father Ezekiel Germaine, a war veteran and eccentric Parish priest who tends to Liz's emotional and spiritual needs whilst Mike is fighting. Liz has been left to contend with her own desires and yearnings. She tries to keep the home fires burning and take good care her children, but she also longs to pick up the theatre career she has abandoned for the demands of motherhood. Liz is a complex, intelligent, and talented woman, who is not only bound by the contradictions of her Catholic faith, but has been forced to put her life on hold for her \\"husband, for God, and for her country.\\"     Liz can handle living with the possibility of Mike's death minute by minute, she can also handle the empty bed, but what she misses is the reality of the depth of their shared life. She's made tenuous peace with the war, with the idiocy of her husband shipping off to protect God and family at the expense of actual wife and kids, and also with the wreckage of her own dreams of getting back into theatre. But Liz is gradually becoming tired of it all - tired of having to justify the indefensible ways of men to children, tired of being a military mother, tired of trying to translate the world's madness and her country's and her husband's into something her son's and daughters could salute.    Captain Mike O'Reilly seems to have been born a Marine; he's \\"a warrior and a believer\\" through and through. And his remarkably literate and erudite letters back to Liz from the front lines suggest that he's having a kind of love affair with the theatre of war. Liz knows \\"he would go back into battle while there were battles to be fought\\" but she loves him regardless. The energy of conflict seems to invigorate Mike until one day he is badly wounded while helping to defend his infantry company.     When Mike hears of Liz's own troubles with their unborn child, Mike is forced to resolve his need for battle with the requirements and responsibilities of family and marriage. Mike has no illusions about the glamour and glory of war; he is a man who understands the meaning of fighting for his country and has made his peace with it for better and for worse. And Liz has come to terms with this side of Mike; she loves the fierceness of her husband's integrity \\"and his strange easy willingness to die for the right thing.\\"     And then of course there's Father Germaine - a wounded Vietnam veteran and a conflicted character who questions what he'd believes he knows of God and life and service, of meaning and of truth. Germaine wants to be with Liz in her suffering, to suffer with her as helpless in it as she is. And also to keep vigil, and to \\"wait with her for the glimmer of God.\\"     From the stink of the troops in the field to the nuances of everyday domestic existence, Farrington weaves a terribly emotional and poetic story of family life and spousal love. This is a family in crisis who must learn to adapt and make peace with a war that is steadily being discredited. Lizzie's War is astounding in its portrayal of the bloody chaos of war as well as the dark humor of a soldier navigating the trenches. But the novel is also a wonderful account of the clash between a mother's everyday duties and her unspoken, implicit and silent desires. Mike Leonard May 05.	2005-05-05

That's all it is"	The atheists and secularists among us will probably turn after reading Southern writer Jay Quinn's overly melodramatic, but gorgeously written novel, Back Where We Started. Steeped in unapologetic and unrepentant histrionics, the story tells of Chris Thayer, a middle-aged, and severely religious gay man, who remakes his life in profound ways. But this isn't just your normal tale of mid-life self-discovery, because Quinn, in creating Chris, has written such a thoughtful, deep, and reflective character that most readers when they finish the book will be left with a weighty sense that they have just met someone very special. The author imbues Chris, with almost saint-like and iconographic sensibilities; he's easily the most complex, adorable, and multi-and faceted \\"Mum\\" one is ever likely to meet.  <br /> <br />Weaving the powerful themes of gay marriage, love and family, parenting, and endurance through faith, Quinn shows what can happen when years of investment in a life that you thought was stable and steadfast can be suddenly pulled out from under you. Chris has been leading a happy, contented life, but after twenty-six years his long-term \\"marriage\\" to his partner Zack Ronan is finally over. Having raised Zack's three children and supported him through his highflying career, Zack, ambitious and selfish, has reverted to the other side of his bisexual nature and has married his secretary, who is now pregnant.  <br /> <br />Coming from working class roots a housing project in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Chris is the epitome of a self-made, self-educated man, who following the suicide of Zack's wife, stepped in and sacrificed most of his adult life to raise and be a mother to Zack's three children, Trey, Schooner, and Andrea. The kids spent their lives affectionately call him \\"Mum\\" and doting him just as much has he spoiled and doted on them. Chris is of course, absolutely devastated at Zack's abandonment. He hears his life \\"rushing ahead to its conclusion without him\\"and given a choice he doubted he'd ever have moved on.  <br /> <br />Determined to maintain his dignity and composure, and armed with the trust fund that Zack has set up for him, Chris begins to face the second act of his life.  But the fund won't support him forever, so Chris needs to get a job, and also find a new place to live. Life does go on and Chris relocates to North Caroline beach community of Emerald Isle, eventually settling into the beach house purchased from part of the proceeds of the sale of the abode he adoringly shared with Zack for all those years. His new home brings with it lots of new and exciting experiences, and his constant positive outlook and his deep and spiritual faith constantly keeps him buoyant and optimistic.  <br /> <br />Chris steadily becomes involved with the life of the community, eventually finding a job and  becoming involved with the patchwork lives of his neighbors: a young husband-and-wife psychiatric couple expecting their first child, the local Catholic Church priest, a hunky, affable veterinarian, and an even more hunky rowdy, rough diamond fisherman. We watch him steadily growing into something new, \\"someone that belongs more to him.\\" <br /> <br />As Chris embarks on his journey of self-discovery, he self-reflects on the life that has gone before and what had made him willing to abandon his own career - his own self - to a man and his motherless brood. He bought into the myth, and tried to live a life of an upwardly mobile mommy with three perfect kids, a handsome and affluent husband, and a properly genteel giant of a hunting dog. It was all an artifice. And it was Zack, after all, that had thrown it all away. But with his new home, Chris soon learns that seeds of love sewn in youth can create wonderful results when nurtured properly. His marriage to Zack bought out Chris's role as a \\"mother\\" and it's not surprising that he retains the lion's share of the children's loyalty, and the realization that his children are his life's work, the part of his journey towards self-acceptance. <br /> <br />As an exploration of what it means for a gay man to be middle-aged and rolling with the punches, Back Where He Started is truly groundbreaking. But the story is also inventive for it's depiction of Chris's faith - it doesn't present his ardent Catholicism in any conflicted way; he's neither blindly accepting of the church's many flaws, nor is he radicalized out of his connection to it, but rather he is searching within it.  <br /> <br />This gorgeously written story is most notable for it's depiction of family. For good or ill, family forms us all, gay and straight. The family depicted in this novel is hardly perfect: They're contentious and arguable, they harbor hurts and bad memories, and they also have pet resentments. But they fundamentally love each other. As their loyalties shift, their emotional needs also shift and change, but Chris is always at their center, constantly remaking and nurturing them. This is a very traditional, conventional human story, yet also one that is absolutely extraordinary. Mike Leonard April 05.  <br />	2005-04-17
US	30922103	R3OV94WZZWJM33	0060734450	479538690	Astonishing Splashes of Colour	Books	4	3	3	N	N	We have to stop spinning occasionally - let the colours show	Astonishing Splashes of Colour was short listed for the Booker Prize - somewhat unjustifiably, because it isn't that good. Clare Morall's writing is sometimes uneven and while her strength is in character development and dialogue, her narrative and sense of structure is often stilted and not as tight as it might be. However, having said this, the book is certainly a good read, and captures with a resounding force the universality of loss and the difficulties of non-communicative families. This is a story of heartbreak and loss, where secrets are maintained for years, and where life can often be a surreal and bizarre kaleidoscope of confusing colour. <br /> <br />Set in the city of Birmingham and using J. M. Barrie's Neverland as a framing device, the story centers on the unconventional Kitty and her disparate, rather eccentric family. From early on it becomes obvious that something terrible has happened to Kitty: we meet her as she waits at the school gates with all the other parents but it is readily clear that she has no child. The reader soon learns that her young son Henry died at birth three years ago and there's nothing but emptiness and barrenness in her life. A children's book critic, Kitty lives in a flat next door to her finicky obsessive-compulsive tidy husband James. They have a kind, decent marriage, but memories of her long lost mother constantly haunt Kitty, and her father and her brothers refuse to talk about her. <br /> <br />Part detective story and part journey of discovery, Astonishing splashes of Colour is about the connection between art, colour, and life. For Kitty, \\"daytime colour is just a faade, a coat of paint splashed on to fool us into thinking the world is genuine.\\" It's as though Kitty's mother had died and taken everything of herself with her, as if she new in advance and sorted through her personal life, destroying all evidence of her existence. Kitty must uncover the truth about her mother, and also her long-lost sister Dinah, so that she can piece together these missing parts to make her life more whole again.  <br /> <br />Kitty is such a complex and beautifully drawn character that readers will immediately emphasize with her plight. She aches to have a child but she only knows children in books, having adventures, discovering things, and thinking things. She likens herself to the lost boys in Peter Pan and because she grew up without a mother, she feels she's lost  - \\"nobody can guide me back to the right place, because there's nobody who can give me what I want.\\"  <br /> <br />As the narrative progresses and the family skeletons are revealed, the colours of life begin to blur too fast, shattering Kitty's already rickety and shaky world. And while her father tries to tell her to be bold by putting all the colours in and mixing them up, \\"because colour is life,\\" Kitty inevitably begins to fall apart and starts to act out bizarre and desperate behaviour resulting in chaos for all around her.  <br /> <br />The novel is full of drama, heartache, and lots of surprises that most viewers will not see coming. And while, at times, the novel may read like a trumped up version of the Eastenders, Astonishing Splashes of Colour is still a compulsive and ultimately satisfying read, where the line between sanity, madness, world-weariness and childlike naivety is explored with great creative and literary skill.

You can read the novel as a harsh indictment of the vacuity of modern life or also as a rather grand and eloquent account of a relationship in various stages of crisis and salvation. Gloominess and pessimism is established at the outset, so is there hope for these characters? Judging by the end of the story, there probably is, although it's not the sort of hope that one would expect. Saul and Patsy as newlyweds, living in the Midwest, together with a small child, are forced to question their values when a young local schoolboy, Gordy Himmelmam, enters their lives, and carries out an act of suicide that sends a terrible emotional ferocity through their lives. <br />Saul is constantly disappointed with the world after having moved to the town of Five Oaks and resents having to \\"mingle with the Cossacks.\\" He feels his disappointment beginning to fester, when he thinks that his life in the Midwest is presenting itself as both bland and coarse. His relationship with Patsy provides his solace, and he is the first to admit that they have an \\"oddball marriage\\" and they know it. Their love for each other has created \\" a magic circle around themselves that outsiders cannot penetrate.\\" The secondary characters flesh out the narrative and provide an emotional juxtaposition to Saul and Patsy. There's Delia, Saul's self obsessed and \\"city wise\\" mother who after years spent in an unremarkable marriage - a marriage that was a practical economic arrangement - commences having an affair with a young boy half her age. And there's Saul's high flying brother Howie, living on the West coast, making lots of money, but ultimately betraying his bother and sister-in-law with secrets and lies.<br />Baxter is a beautifully eloquent writer, and he effortlessly weaves the domestic, sexual and emotional lives of Saul and Patsy through the narrative. The strength is in the trivial - the \\"candied goo covering a toothbrush,\\" the taming of sexual passion into a marriage ceremony, and the \\"kitchen windows rattling from the stage-managed wind.\\" But the story seems to lose its focus at the end, as though Baxter is having trouble finding a conclusion, or an ultimate resolution to the crisis that presents itself to the two main protagonists. Nevertheless, Saul and Patsy is a charming and sincere read, and I'm looking forward to reading more of Baxter's work. <br />Michael	2003-12-26

Mr. Timothy takes us on the journey of Timothy Cratchet, who with his trusty companions Colin, the Melodious and the enigmatic Philomela, works to break up a sinister pedophile ring reaching high up into the British aristocracy. Bayard has recreated the world of grown-up Timothy Cratchet - the crutch-wielding tyke from Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol - who is now a \\"mostly able-bodied\\" 23 years old residing in a London whorehouse in exchange for tutoring the madam. He struggles to wean himself from financial dependence on his ancient \\"Uncle\\" Ebenezer Scrooge, and is haunted by the spirit of his late father--a man whose optimism and strength the son feels himself incapable of imitating. <br />We first encounter Timothy, during the Christmas season of 1860. He's vexed by the discovery of two dead 10-year-old girls, each branded with the letter \\"G\\"--one found in an alley, the other fished from the Thames River by Cratchit and his \\"diamond in the rough\\" best friend Gully. What follows, is a tale of horror and a wonderfully breathless flight through the teeming markets, shadowy passageways and the rolling, sinister foggy London of the 1860's. Bayard brings the sights, sounds and smells of 19th century London vividly to life: The smoky, stinky atmosphere of London pubs; the claustrophobic feeling of Mrs. Sharpe's brothel; \\"the kitchen grease, the rat droppings and the spit-laden gin\\"; the muddy streets of London with the \\"shattered frothing cisterns, and the wrenched-off water spouts, clogged with black ice.\\"<br />Totally atmospheric on substance and tone, Bayard reinvents Dickens for the modern reader, and provides us with a very clever story that is perfect for Christmas. You also don't need to have read A Christmas Carol or know anything about the story to enjoy this novel. My only criticism is that I wish Bayard had included some gay content in his story - even a subplot involving a gay or lesbian character would have sufficed for showing us what life may have been like for our community in 1860's England. Nevertheless, Mr. Timothy is a wonderfully inventive and a meticulously researched read. <br />Michael<br />.	2003-12-20
US	30922103	R33PWJDK9SEVSC	0375401466	160007841	Old School	Books	4	5	5	N	N	An eloquent account of a writer�s life	Tobias Wolff has written quite a charming and beautifully elegant piece of work. He really brings to life the stuffy, and somewhat snobby atmosphere of a New England prep school in the early 1960's, while at the same time recounting his thoughts on literary sacrifice and the nature of artistic endeavor. Determined to make an impression, and to fit into the \\"tribe\\" the narrator, in desperation plagiarizes a story in order to obtain a private meeting with Ernest Hemmingway. Unfortunately, his actions come back to haunt him, and in his final year, everything he's achieved unravels.<br />Wolff writes what he knows about, and he obviously has a great admiration for the world of literature. He recreates the dorm life of the school with startling authenticity - fifty different records playing at once, doors slamming, loud voices in long hallways, and the faint hiss of many showers all running together. The boys are conveyed in a gentlemanly, yet also rebellious light - their woolly smell, their silences in chapel, their furtive cigarette smoking, and their good manners. Much of the novel talks about what it means to be a writer, and the sorts of sacrifices and struggles that a writer must go through to produce and create his work. The struggling life of a writer is also talked about, and Wolff is making the point that a writer does not have to have an exemplary life to write great literature, rather a great writer can also lead a mundane and incidental life; it is the incidental life that can sometimes be the real fodder for great literature. <br />There are some nice moments in Old School particularly the scene when the writer Ayn Rand comes to visit. And the narrator, flu ridden and unwell realizes for the first time that heroism doesn't necessarily come from doing majestic acts, but can in fact, come from the simple acts of giving time to children, domestic cares and the exertions of ordinary sympathy. Wolff has a nice, easy relaxed style that is \\"clean\\" without being too simplistic. Old School isn't one of my favourite novels of the year but I do think that the novel will definitely appeal to anyone who has a love of literature and writing; it's a simple and graceful novel that has a lot of complex things to say.<br />Michael.	2003-12-12

This is an absolutely riveting and heartbreaking account of one community's triumph over a crippling disease. Told from the point of view of Rachel Kalama, and her best friend Sister Catherine, Molokai spans two generations of Hawaiian history - from the 1890's to the 1970's - as it gradually recounts the lives of those inflicted with Hansen's disease. <br />Totally ambitious in scope, Molokai is a real testament to human suffering, and how perseverance, family loyalties, and cultural ties can really triumph in the face of adversity. Torn from her adoring parents as a little girl, Rachel is forced to live on Molokai in the town of Kalaupapa where life is hard and disease is everywhere. Rachel and her friends are confined to a green triangle six square miles of shore rock, and that within these boundaries - the implacable geometry of their confinement - they are forced to make a life for themselves. The descriptions of the death and disfigurement at Kalaupapa are excruciatingly real yet really quite touching, as we witness the tireless people who work to help prolong lives. Leprosy is woven into the fabric of their everyday lives, \\"a black thread that could never be cut\\".<br />The story does, at times, become a little histrionic and melodramatic as Rachel encounters one terrible situation after another, but don't let this detract from the powerfully affecting experience of reading this novel. Throughout the story some wonderful characters display their own difficulties and troubles. There's Rachel's husband Kenji, loyal, hard working and kind; her father Henry affable and easy going, who voyages the world and brings Rachel back dolls from all the wonderful places he visits; her daughter Ruth, and her \\"hanai\\" aunt Haleola who is a \\"healer\\" or \\"kahuna\\" and believes that sickness comes from the soul and from a person's past actions and state of mind. There's also Uncle Pono exiled to the Island just before Rachel herself is transported and the boisterous and funny transvestite Leilani who finally succumbs to the disease like so many of Rachel's other friends and companions.<br />Molokai also works as a dramatic recreation of the history of the Hawaii. Brennert recounts the history of the Islands from the late 19th century, when Congress decided that Hawaii should be annexed to the United States. We witness the influx of Christianity threatening the Hawaiian values and way of life, the arrival of electricity and the advent of American domestic engineering, the first airplanes, the fatal attack on Pearl Harbour and the final cure for Hansen's disease, which literally wipes out the illness overnight. Each incident is seen through the eyes of Rachel and through her life of confinement, suffering and hardship on Molokai. This is a profound and sweeping saga  - meticulously researched and beautifully written. Molokai is a must read <br />Michael.	2003-12-11

And is packed with great, lively characters that mischievously weave in and out of each other's lives. Michael Thomas Ford has written an incredibly entertaining first novel, which is not only packed with some timely references to popular culture, but is also an extremely perceptive account of modern gay life and the sorts of issues that gay people, particularly younger gay people face today.<br />Ford is raising lots of interesting issues, and doing this with humour and insight: Can sex be just sex, an act separate from love and presumably no threat to a relationship? Can there more to love than the reproduction of children and the leaving of legacies? What is the fairy tale nature of love and can people keep the passion going long after the movie credits role?  How does one cope with one-night stands and being single again after so long in a relationship? And can one be a normal gay guy in the sense of not belonging to any particular gay clique?<br />Set in the gay Mecca of Provincetown with its wind-swept dunes, lazy summer afternoons, and starry nights, the book centers around Josh Felling When his lover of seven years, Doug, announces that he's recently had an affair, Josh's world is turned upside down. His whole life, Josh has believed in true love, even though his friends tease him for being a hopeless romantic. He really thought that he and Doug were forever. Broken-hearted, he heads to P-Town for a few days of reflection and to figure out where his relationships, and his life, are headed. But the summer has other plans for Josh, and his weekend trip to P-town will bring bigger changes than he ever imagined. We follow Josh and a rich cast of characters as they live through an unforgettable summer together and find the answer to many of life's challenges. <br />There are lots of entertaining and astutely drawn characters: The hunky \\"straight\\" carpenter Reilly Brennan with his fantasies aboutmen and his imminent marriage to his fiancée Donna; P-town's unofficial lesbian mayor, Jackie Stavers, who has a failing relationship and a ticking biological clock; Toby Evans, looking for a new and openly gay life, fresh-faced and fresh out of a Midwestern high school. And there's Emmeline, P-town's resident drag royalty and how she has to cope with the arrival of her overbearing invalid mother. There's also gay Hollywood producer Reid Truman who is looking to find true love with Ty Rusk, Hollywood's latest young movie idol. <br />The characters merge and intertwine with a \\"six degrees of separation-like\\" quality, as secrets are revealed and each character reaches their cross roads of life. Hot, sexy and entertaining, Last Summer is probably one of the best gay novels in quite a while. I also agree with the other reviewers - the cover art is just beautiful.<br />Michael.	2003-12-04

I've delayed writing a review for Harvard Yard, mainly because I've been at a bit of a loss at what to actually say about such a huge and mighty tome. On the one hand I admire its structure and its incredible audacity, yet on the other hand, underdeveloped characters, and an unnecessarily convoluted storyline, hinder the novel. But as someone who is not from America, and has only a patchy knowledge of American history, I really enjoyed the historical education that Harvard Yard imparts. The arrival of the pilgrims, the Salem witch hunts, the War of Independence, the Civil War, the arrival of the industrialized twentieth century, and the sinking of the Titanic, are all recounted with a breezy authenticity and a remarkable sincerity. Harvard Yard flows along at a fast pace, with William Martin giving us just enough period detail to wet our appetites for something more. I just wish he had taken more time with some of the periods, maybe slowed down and included a little more detail involving some of the main characters. <br />The strength of the novel is in the beginning when Isaac Wedge becomes one of the first students at the first college in English America, founded on the edge of the wilderness, just six years after the settlement of the colony itself. The strength of is also in the enduring \\"mystery\\" of Shakespeare's play \\"Love Labor's Won which may or may not have lasted all these years and survived down though the generations of Wedges. The novel speaks about the universality of artistic inheritance and the lengths that families will go to preserve their heritage and speak to one another from the past.  <br />Although the novel is about rebellion war, and devotion, there is also an important detective story running through the modern day narrative, as Peter Fallon, who has found evidence that the undiscovered Shakespeare play is hidden somewhere at the college, races against time to uncover the mystery before other protagonists get their hands on the manuscript.Fans of libraries, literature, and writing will find a lot to admire in this work, as the world of historical - and modern - academia is bought vividly and authentically to life. Harvard Yard is not one of my favorites for the year, but it is still a good, if not excessively long read. <br />Michael	2003-12-01
US	30922103	R119YVLFA7R5C9	0618343970	476779024	The Calligrapher: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	The inconstancies of love between men and women	The Calligrapher is a story that is so true, so moving, so elegant, so witty, and insightful, so fine, so direct, and so oblique that you cannot help but surrender to its mastery. This novel is a fine treatise on the nature of love, and the lengths that humans will actually go to fall in love. John Donne's love poetry provides the thematic skeleton of the story, as the reader follows the travails of Jasper, a very modern man, who is a breaker of hearts, and an absolutely selfish, but at the same time rather endearing womanizer. A calligrapher by profession and a totally self-obsessed hedonist, Jasper falls head over hills in love with Madeleine his beautiful neighbour. What follows is a fabulous tale of seduction and obsession as Jasper is forced to confront the ghosts of his deceitful past.<br />Jasper is betrayed by love, and his own duplicitous behavior comes back to haunt him. Ultimately he becomes a man tortured by unrequited love - a man who turns out to be wounded, bedraggled and dismembered. Along the way Jasper is constantly expounding his views on all sorts of issues about life and modern society. We hear his thoughts on Australians, women, god, sex and the nature of love - and he never ceases to surprise us with his witty banter and cynical sense of humour. For Jasper, love is cautious and mute, \\"an unknowable risk taken in the darkness during unsettled weather\\". But in his journey to find the meaning of love, Jasper is actually embarking on a journey of self-discovery and maturity. <br />The lengths of falsehood and deceit that the characters go to in this novel is breathtaking in its scope, and the sudden plot twist, involving Madeleine and one of the other characters will make you absolutely gasp in surprise. Contemporary society hasn't changed that much since John Donne's time and this story shows that his love poetry may probably be just as relevant today - people are still plagued by issues of faithfulness, unfaithfulness; truth falsity, and possession. <br />Fans of calligraphy will find much to appreciate in this novel. Docx inculcates the tale with lots of details on the history and techniques of calligraphy, and he does this without ever stultifying the story. The reader learns about Rustic Roman Capitals, Half Uncial, New Roman Cursive and the ancient beauty of illuminated manuscripts. And these details are effortlessly woven into the narrative. There's also some fantastic descriptions of London - the Chinese tailors on Carnaby Street, the inner city groove of Soho and the foggy beauty of Wimbledon Common, And there's also some beautifully atmospheric descriptions of Rome, where Jasper and Madeleine holiday together - the street lanterns in the Ponte Sisto, the scrawny Tiber, and the dome of St. Peter's. <br />This is an extraordinarily modern and contemporary story with a splendidly historical bent. One of the best books of the year, and an absolute must read. Docx is a startlingly fresh and talent writer whose take on human relationships is brutally honest; he's a real talent, and I can't wait for his next novel. <br />Michael	2003-11-26

For me, the real story in Brick Lane is the incredible insularity of Nanzeen's domestic existence. Setting the story in a poor and dilapidated housing development, Ali envelopes us with the sites, sounds and smells of urban London, along with Nanzeen and Chanu's familial home. Brick Lane is an absolutely realistic immigrant story and the reader really gets a feel for what it must be like for new immigrants, many of who are from poor countries such as Bangladesh, who are trying to make homes for themselves in a new country.<br />Caught in an arranged, passionless marriage to the bombastic, idealistic Chanu, Nanzeen longs for something more. She stares out at the full moon late at night and wishes most of all for a secure place in the world, and a security she has tried to seek but just cannot find. She suffers terribly from homesickness and holds onto the memories of her childhood in Gouripur with her sister - she remembers the vibrant colour, the torrential rains, the golden land, deep green paddies, the snowy cranes, the drying rice stalks, and the village women who clean the large, bloody fish.  Frustrated, frightened, and longing for independence, Nanzeen falls into a passionate relationship with Karim, a young local activist. The affair, while awakening her sexually, forces her to make life-changing decisions that reverberate throughout her family. <br />The first half of the novel is perhaps the most engaging as life in London is veiled though Nanzeen's eyes. Walking the streets of London with her sari and headscarf on, she's conscious of everyone watching her, and is startled by the differences in Western women - their short-cropped hair, and their propensity to wear trousers. Nanzeem is overwhelmed by London - the cars jamming the roads, the fatty smells, the people weaving in and out of the sidewalks and the tube stations There are some wonderful scenes describing the richness and vitality of immigrant life - the Wentworth Street Market, with its stalls lining the road, cloths draped on wire hangers in the windows, Jamaican patties on sale, and tinned foods at 40 percent off.<br />The story abounds with mouth watering descriptions of ethnic foods  - the dal, chicken wings spread in a paste of yogurt and spices, chickpeas and tomatoes stewed with cumin, and hard boiled eggs glazed in a curry seal.  So much detail is given to Nanzeen's apartment life - the papers and files, the glass showcase, the pottery tigers, lions and elephants, and a copy of the Qur'an in its special ledge. There are lots of issues raised in this book - racial unrest, the cultural clash, and the disenfranchisement of immigrant communities. Ali packs the narrative with so many concerns, that the story can be a little overwhelming, and interestingly much of the local ethnic tensions are framed against the events of 9/11. Brick Lane is an engaging and involving story, full of passion, drama and humour; it is well worth the journey. <br />Michael	2003-11-21

I was somewhat disappointed with A Place of Execution; although good, it was rather long, and lacked the tightly driven plot and dramatic tension that is usually synonymous with McDermid's work.  The actions of the past and how much these dealings come back to haunt us are woven through A Distant Echo, as throughout the first half of the book, the reader is catapulted back to New Year's Eve in 1978 and then, in the second half of the book, bought forward to 2003 where redemption and truth are finally revealed. <br />McDermid creates a solid and chilly atmosphere as she describes bleak and cold Scottish winters in the town of Kirkcaldy and in the University Town of St, Andrews, where our four main protagonists live. On a frosty, icy night four young students Tom, Alex, David, and Sigmund, full of optimism and idealism about their lives and careers, find the blood soaked body of Rosie Duff, a local girl, who has been brutally stabbed. What happens next turns into a riveting tale of recrimination and blame, as the boys faced with a seemingly, disinterested and inadequate local police force, face a life branded as killers. A Distant Echo, in classic whodunit style really keeps you guessing, and the tension and suspense never ceases as time periods are transcended and the real killer is gradually revealed. <br /> McDermid, to her credit, infuses the narrative with lots of things Scottish. References are constantly made to homemade shortbread, nappies, black bun, sultana cake, Scottish country dancing, grouse, and whiskey. You really get a sense of familiarity, and that McDermid is completely passionate about her roots. She also raises lots of issues to do with gay bashing, hate crimes, and religious intolerance, so the story always has a sense of propinquity, immediacy, and relevance. A Distant Echo is a superbly crafted thriller and well worth the wait. And it without doubt reflects Val McDermid's unique talent as a one of the world's most pre-eminent mystery writers. This is a must read for fans of murder mysteries.<br />Michael	2003-11-16

Funny, and heartbreaking this book is just so ambitious in scope and range. But I'm stopping short of giving it five stars because I felt that parts of the story were a little overly developed, and in general, the novel was a little long. Still though, Mailman is a wonderful read, and in many ways is an absolutely powerful indictment of heartless tragedies that can exist in modern life and society. <br />Albert Lippincott, or the Mailman as he calls himself, is such a complex modern \\"ant-hero\\" - trundling along in his dead-end job as a Mailman with the U.S. Postal Service, while surreptitiously reading customers mail on the sly, and also recounting in a kind of vast mindscape, the loves, dramas and tragedies of his life. There are some marvelous moments in this novel, particularly when Albert recounts his childhood: his strange, sexually ambiguous relationship with his sister Gillian, his efforts to trap and defeat his high school English teacher Jim Gorman, and his failed, obscenely misguided trip to Kazakhstan with the Peace Corps, which will have you roaring with laughter. <br />Robert Lennon has complete control of his narrative, and using succinct precise language explores, not only Albert's inner thoughts with his cynical and sardonic observations about life and the world around him, but also explores, with an understated beauty, the quirkiness and eccentricities of small-town American life. The reader is constantly \\"blasted\\" with an almost stream of consciousness storyline, as Albert, betrayed, disappointed, and unrequited, fills his head with equations, images, sounds and sensations as if some extra dimensional vessel has flowed into him and he is the vessel. At the end of the novel he looks back with regret - he was a lousy student, a duplicitous mailman, and a rotten husband: demanding, ungrateful, and uncooperative - and he has such a sense of melancholy and disappointment towards all of this. Thechaos of Mailman's existence mirrors the chaos of the universe; the universe, like Mailman's sad abortive life isn't orderly at all; \\"it was a god-awful mess that nobody could sort out.\\"<br />Mailman is one of the most insightful, challenging and ambitious books of the year and certainly deserves a lot of attention. <br />Michael	2003-11-12
US	30922103	R35OHG7GQXI9DW	0385505914	870481550	Train: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Sex, murder and nihilism in violent Los Angeles.	Pete Dexter introduces us to a dark, violent and cruel Los Angeles, as a takes us on a ride through a city that churns with racism and subversive emotion. This isn't one of my favourite books of the year, but I admire it for its doggedness and tenacity, and for Dexter's ability to really paint a vivid picture of a city where racial unrest is never far from the surface and where people will do whatever they can to survive in a seemingly harsh and uncaring world.<br />The novel's focus is on three remarkably different people, with each affecting the other in remarkably different ways. Sergeant Miller Packer is unassuming and tough. He befriends Nora after two Negroes murder her husband and brutally rape her, then embarks on an exceedingly erotic and tempestuous affair with her in an attempt to make her forget her past and the terrible incident that has marked her both physically and spiritually. Packer also befriends Lionel Walk or Train, the protagonist of the title, a young African-American caddie who works at a local, elite Los Angeles golf course.  Packer adopts Train because, he not only sees something wonderful in his golfing skills and wants to help him, but he also sees Train's natural skills as a way of making a quick buck on the lucrative underground gambling circuit.<br />As the novel progresses, the tensions rise between Packer and Nora, as Packer starts to devote more time to Train and his astonishingly proficient golfing skills. Nora, disaffected, newly pregnant, and relying on medication to get her through the days, starts to gradually loose control with devastating consequences both for Packer and for Train. With short, sharp chapters, Dexter gradually builds the tension throughout, so that just when you think that something good might happen, some horribly violent incident comes along which shakes you to the core and sabotages any possibility of achieving happiness for these characters.<br />Moving gracefully between the golf courses Brookline, the Paradise Development, and Watts, Darktown and Beverly Hills, Dexter deftly shows the kinds of racial and economic divides that existed in Los Angeles in the 1950's. From the racism of the white golf players, and the corruption and bigotry of the police to the petty concerns of the rich Beverly Hills neighbours of Nora and Packer's, Dexter portrays a complete picture of the kinds if insensitivities that exist in society. In fact, his vision is so undoubtedly bleak that one wonders whether he is seeing any hope at all for the world. This vision is really bought to the forefront when Train's blind best friend, Plural states towards the end of the novel that\\" the world is a hungry place, man. And whatever kind of thing you is, there's something out there that likes to eat it.\\" This observation pretty well wraps up the themes of Train. No matter what, there's always someone out there who is going to exploit and take advantage of you; human nature is uncaring and society is really on the brink. As a portrait of three very conflicted characters, Train is nihilism at its best.<br />MichaelParadise Development, and Watts, Darktown and Beverly Hills, Dexter deftly shows the kinds of racial and economic divides that existed in Los Angeles in the 1950's.

US	30922103	R2DRTOUKDMJLZ7	015100806X	661969266	Breaking Her Fall	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A father � daughter relationship caught on the brink	The year is 1998 and the Clinton sex scandals are plaguing the White House; all over the country people are talking and passing judgment on the President. This unlikely setting forms the backdrop for Stephen Goodwin's ambitious, intelligent and somewhat overemotional story of teenage sex, and family relationships. Although to some extent melodramatic in places, Breaking Her Fall is still a very accomplished, and at times, quite riveting domestic drama, that really captures you from the outset, and embraces you in its entirety.<br />One night Tucker Jones, an American \\"ordinary man\\"  - a loving and devoted father receives a hostile phone call from another parent who blames his thirteen-year-old daughter, Kat, for indulging in a drunken sexual orgy with some boys at a party. This sets of a chain reaction of violence and recrimination, which reverberates throughout Tucker's entire life affecting his children, his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and his best friends. On the surface, the story passes for an attention-grabbing legal drama, where Tucker - accused of assaulting one of the boys - fights to save his reputation, and his innocence. But, in reality, the story is much more than this: Goodwin introduces us to a subtle domestic world seething with pent up tensions - strained relationships between ex-wives; father-daughter relationships that are not what they seem; unspoken sexual passions between best friends that are clandestinely acted upon, and teenage pregnancy which inevitably rears its controversial head.  <br />Goodwin writes with a clear confidence of a professional, and he keeps the narrative taught and tight by placing the story in the first person and always telling the story through Tucker's point of view, The narrative flows with a gentleness and ease, never loosing sight of its focus, and the author is determined to share with us every aspect of Tucker's life - from his days doing drugs in college, to the history of his courtship with his ex-wife Trish, to his decision to leave the corporate world, and build an independent life for himself as a landscape gardener. The strength of Breaking Her Fall is also in its enthusiastically believable characters: There's the somewhat self-obsessed and hot-headed main protagonist Tucker, who doesn't think before he acts, but who loves his two children dearly; there's Kat, Tucker's teenage daughter - impetuous, rude, conflicted and unhappy, and there's Tucker's best friend Lily, naive and kind, whose only crime is to want more passion in her life and be the woman who Tucker really loves. There are lots of other supporting characters that weave with equal grace in and out of the narrative, each contributing their own stories, and each influencing Tucker's life in one way or another.<br />About half way through the book, the character of Lily, speaking at her father's funeral talks about how her father made her feel safe and rescued, and that if she \\"fell\\" her father would be there to catch her. Perhaps this reflects the thematic core of the novel in that there should always be someone there to catch us if we fall. Loneliness, loss, the inability to communicate, family structures, the value of friendships, and the ability to be able to make the \\"right\\" decision are all presented in Breaking Her Fall with an astute and sensitive clarity. This is a very perceptive and emotionally sensitive piece of work.<br />Michael	2003-11-06
US	30922103	RU6JXRQ1LJC3Z	0802117465	540294205	The Life and Adventures of Lyle Clemens: A Novel	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Riotous fun for some, but a bit of a disappointment for me.	I've really enjoyed most of John Rechy's work, particularly Marylin's Daughter The miraculous day of Amalia Gómez, and to a lesser extent, The coming of the night, but The Life and Adventures of Lyle Clemens, although clever in it's structure, was disappointing. This book just didn't work for me. I can appreciate that many readers will absolutely love the humor and comedy in this, but for me, it unfortunately, just fell flat. Part of the problem is perhaps that Rechy's dialogue just lacked sparkle and sharpness. The narrative works well as a type of \\"sit-com\\" situational comedy loosely modeled, of course on Henry Fielding's 18th-century classic The History of Tom Jones. But I just felt that the dialogue between the main characters lacked sharp acid wit, that we should expect from a writer such a Rechy. His writing seemed rushed and hurried, and I wanted him to take more time with his story; maybe relax and really consolidate his characters more securely in their time and place.  <br />Lyle Clemens is indeed an endearing character, and there's an incredible sexual innocence to his character.  Born in Texas, to the beautiful, but forsaken Silvia Love, who takes to drink when Lyle's father dumps her, and her hopes of becoming Miss America are crushed by her fundamentalist mother. Lyle is tremendously naïve and blissfully unaware of his good looks, lustiness and sexiness. People fawn around him like flies - there's Maria, the Mexican beauty, and Rose who teaches him about sex and how to seduce a virgin with confidence. Silvia's best friend Clarita - a rather staid stereotype of an older Mexican-American - who helps to raise Lyle and remains loyal to Silvia. There are lots of other minor characters that meet Lyle and help him along on his adventurous journey through life. Sister Matilda, is a gospel singer who befriends Lyle, the aging starlet Tarah Worth, the crooked evangelists Brother Bud and Sister Sis, and a couple of pornographers who have suspiciously well recognizable names. It's nice that Mr. Rechy has incorporated some gay content into his story with the character of Raul, a gay boy who falls in love with Lyle and falls into the \\"devilish\\" clutches of the evangelists.<br />Generally though, I felt that Life and Adventures of Lyle Clemens read too much like an afternoon soap opera, rather than a satire of our contemporary age, which is what the story is supposed to symbolize.  I'm sure die-hard fans of Rechy will love this - and they generally due judging by some of the other glowing reviews. But if you want the best John Rechy, I would venture into some of his earlier work, particularly City of Night. <br />Michael	2003-11-02
US	30922103	R3MZRISJ1ORYML	0385500696	545684646	The Fortress of Solitude: A Novel	Books	3	25	32	N	N	A mighty but flawed dirge	I'm in two minds about this book. On the one hand I'm conflicted about the novel's style and structure, yet on the other hand I'm in absolute awe of its enormous scope and passion. Fortress of Solitude was just far too over embellished with detail and Lethem's style just seemed out of control. Lethem really needed a good editor to ferret out some of the more long-winded passages, rein his style in, and condense the novel to a more sensible length.  Much of Fortress of Solitude is satisfactory for its insight into the sights and sounds of Brooklyn in the 1970's, yet its also frustrating in its intensity. Lethem writes as though he is obsessed with some \\"Joycean\\" like force, as though he can't wait to splurge and gorge any thought he ever had onto the printed page. He has a kind of bold, confrontational style, but his work reads like a clunky, turgid school report from his youth. <br />The real star of this book is not Dylan Ebdus or Mingus Rude but the world that they inhabit. Dean Street in the Seventies is a world teetering in the edge - drugs are rife, the yuppies are moving in, gang life proliferates, and a sense of economic decline permeates the area. To is credit, Lethem's descriptions of Dean Street are good - the oil stained body shops and forlorn graffitied warehouses, the sprays of broken glass on the side walks, the Puerto Ricans, the images of the dilapidated brownstones, and the liquor stores. This, after all, is the Seventies and Lethem, to his credit infuses his narrative with references to pop culture - the movie Logan's Run, Star Trek, disco hits, cocaine, and the grooviest pop groups. Lethem periodically intersperses the narrative with pop songs of the period, as the story gradually moves forward into the 80's and 90's. <br />The main problem that I found with this novel is that Lethem never really allows us access to the main characters' inner thoughts. We have some wonderful descriptions of time and place - but I never got the sense that the author was privileging us to what Mingus, Dylan and Arthur were actually thinking, and this is also true of many of the secondary characters. The reader is constantly the observer on in this novel, always on the outside and at all times looking in.  On the positive side, Lethem has a good ear for recreating natural conversation and portrays rather adroitly the particular black inflections of the period.  But generally though, I found this novel to be a big disappointment, and an over the top, shoddy, and slapdash mess. Fortress of Solitude is all over the place, which is a pity, because Lethem has much passion and zeal as a writer.<br />Michael	2003-10-30
US	30922103	R32E9VXUIW83V3	0060004843	272587061	Fanny: A Fiction	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A vast, astute and sweeping historical saga	Edmund White in his last book the Married Man gave us a heart wrenching account of loyalty and death in the age of AIDS. Over the years he has never ceased to amaze me with his eclectic and original work. Fanny is his first foray into historical fiction, and what a \\"ripping\\" read it is. Fanny is also the type of book that you almost have to read in one sitting, as White's eloquent, whimsical and elegant style demands your full attention. The story whisks along at such a deft and fast pace that you just can't put it down. <br />White totally envelopes us in the world of the 1820's with Frances Trollope, a narrator who is telling a story as much about herself as of her friend and consort, Fanny Wright. I must confess, I knew absolutely nothing about Fanny Wright, so the story of her forward thinking ideas, and the fact that a women with those kind of ideas had a voice during this time was very interesting to me. <br />Fanny White is truly a remarkable woman and when one considers the era in which she lived, she certainly achieved some significant feats. In 1829 she had been the most controversial and notorious woman in America. She was the first woman in America to speak publicly about slavery, the first woman ever to address a mixed audience, a notorious atheist, the first leader of the first labor party, and the most radical journalist in the land. Francis sees Fanny as determined and vibrant, but also bourgeois, selfish, hypocritical and superior. And their friendship endures years of highs and lows. <br />Fanny: A Fiction, is about the changing and tumultuous geo-political landscape of America at the time. The religious fervor, and infant evangelism of the mid-west is juxtaposed with the efforts of Fanny to create an equal, socialistic society where marriage is outlawed, the races are equal and where the spiritual and holy are spurned. Frances's observations of the New World are striking in their authenticity and humour, and many readers will laugh at her commentsabout the transatlantic differences in attitudes and life styles. Perhaps these differences are not so uncommon even today. Interestingly, the story is also peppered with real historical figures, which add a sense of authenticity and historical kudos to the tale. Although they play only cameo roles, The Brownings, Lafayette, Thomas Jefferson, and James Fenimore Cooper, influence and sway the way the inimitable Fanny feels about certain issues. <br />Poor Francis Trollope - she's reduced to poverty, married to a man who is chilly and uncaring. And she's trying desperately to raise her children in a climate of paucity. Fanny and her worldviews induce Francis with a kind of fatalistic enthusiasm and eagerness that was unobtainable from anywhere else. This story is a remarkable testament to this fervor and commitment, even though in many respects, the friendship didn't work out for the best. Fanny is probably one of the most entertaining, well-written and intriguing stories of the year, and is a real testament to Edmund's White's brilliance as a writer. <br />Michael	2003-10-27

The lead protagonist is so beautifully drawn, and such a well-rounded, multi-dimensional character that the reader is just left reeling in awe at Houllebecq's skill in creating him. Michel, disaffected, detached and very cynical - eking out an existence of prepackaged pleasure on TV dinners, hollow friendships and porn - goes on a package tour of Thailand where he meets Valerie, a fellow, sexually free French girl. Both are sexually rapacious and predatory, so back in France they hook up, and together with her boss Jean Yves, they devise a scheme to develop a network of \\"sex Tourism\\" resorts to save their ailing travel company. <br />As the novel progresses Houllebecq charts Michel's growth, sexual responsiveness and \\"humanization\\" with a fierce awareness. This is an astute character study, where we witness a forty year old, lonely, and somewhat raffish individual being reborn and, in effect, being \\"humanized.\\" Michel himself admits that his life with Valerie has radically changed him and that he is absolutely blessed and he feels fortunate at having been given a \\"second chance\\" at his age. The final part of this novel is absolutely shocking in its content, as Michel and Valerie suffer the effects of a devastating Islamic terrorist attack on their resort. In graphic detail the attack mirrors in many ways the recent Bali bombing, which is also kind of interesting.  <br />This book isn't for everyone; some of the moralists may be put off by the startling and raw sexuality, but I think that the book is raising some serious questions about the way the West views sex, and also the way that sexuality has become a marketable, economic commodity. Bangkok 8 also raised these issues, but I think Platform does this much more successfully, because it goes further and postulates on a future where both women and men have given up on looking for romance and are so busy with their professional lives that they will increasingly seek to pay for sex in third world counties. Houllebecq proposes a grim bleak future as people from the moneyed; hard working, market driven and capitalist West will be unable to relate to one another sexually or in any other way, and will increasingly turn to populations from countries like Thailand in the search for physical and emotional intimacy. Sex is a product that can be exchanged for a price, and devoid of morality, it inevitably becomes just like other Western products.<br />I don't think Platform is particularly ant-Muslim, but I do think it is raising some series issues about the Islamic faith, and the religion's attitudes to matters of sexuality. This is not one of my favorite books of the year, yet it certainly deserves some attention, and Houllebecq should certainly be commended for tackling these issues with such honesty and candor. I will definitely look forward to reading more of his work.<br />Michael	2003-10-21

The syrupiness, sweetness and triteness is just piled on in all its glory in this story of fourteen year old Lily, and her journey of self-discovery. This novel, bathed in fake sentiment, is just so totally cloying in attitude and tone, and it is probably one of the worst books I've read this year. What I find really insulting is that this kind of material is so popular and gets so much coverage when there is so much better quality literary fiction around - some of which I review - that you can really sink your literary chops into. Most of the characters are terribly staid stereotypes - the nasty, ill educated, violent and intolerant white folks, who feel threatened by integration and the blowsy, colorful, religiously inclined African American women who are full of unconditional love and understanding in the face of adversity.<br />When Rosaleen is brutally beaten at the police station, I found it absolutely unbelievable that not one individual came forward and spoke out at the injustice of this - they may not intervened, but they certainly would not have benignly stood by and let this happen without saying something. I also found it inconceivable that Lily's father was so unbelievably bad, without sufficient explanation. Yes, a part of him blamed Lily for her mother's death, but there was also no capacity for redemption built into his character at all. Monk Kidd writes colourfully and obviously with great passion, but her thematic landscape is in a severe and stark black and white.<br />In all fairness though, The Secret Life of Bees does have some redeeming factors. I thought Monk Kidd did a good job of setting the action against the racial unrest and bourgeoning civil rights era of nineteen sixty four. We really get a sense of the period - the signing of the civil rights act, a young Walter Cronkite on television, and the robotic exploration of the moon, in preparation for the planned moon landing. There's also a nice lyrical quality to Monk Kidd's writing with some expressive and poetic descriptions of South Carolinian countryside, along with T. Ray's peach fields, the pink house and, of course, the bee hives - the whirling clouds of bees, the scent of honey and the bee hum. There are still, however, not enough qualities in this book to recommend it - it's pretty much a contrived, hackneyed, and cliched story which reeks of weakness and mediocrity.<br />Michaelplanned moon landing.

Catholicism frustrates and prevents Santerre family from fully accepting, and accommodating each other's decisions as they go through life. Margot, Clarissa and Jamie, as they grow older and make their own choices about how they want to live their lives, seem to absent themselves from the traditional beliefs of their parents, Teddy and Yvette. Times change, and society changes, as the traditional values of the postwar nineteen fifties, are replaced by the freethinking sixties, the rebelliousness of the seventies, and the realism and hard choices of the nineties. In Meloy's story Catholicism is always there, subconsciously influencing each generation of the Santerre family one way or another, whether they like it or not. <br />Meloy certainly set herself a challenging task of telling a sweeping multi-generational story in just over two hundred and fifty pages. And her stark, almost severe style lends itself quite well to telling this story concisely and quickly. In fact, at times her story seems almost two hurried - I wanted her to slow down and not be in such a rush to tell the tale. There's also a tendency for Meloy's style to be almost under-developed. Multi-generational stories can be difficult to do - the structure has to be exact; Michael Cunningham did a good job at it with Flesh and Blood, and with Liars and Saints, Meloy employs similar techniques. Each chapter is told from a different point of view with each family member recording their feelings and motivations about the similar events in each of their lives. This effect works quite well in moving the story along and creating believable characters that have to face hard choices in life. <br />Liars and Saints has lots of twists and turns in the plot, as Yvette's secret is gradually revealed, and the results of her clandestine act gradually reverberate throughout her family. Some of the incidences are a little contrived and overly melodramatic  - such as Jamie seeking out his real father and then inviting his new found father to the funeral at the end of the story - but generally the novel is a pretty involving, if not a rather commonplace read.<br />Michael	2003-10-17

Mendelson is probably more like the great social observer Iris Murdoch, who would place a group of people together in certain situations and see how they cope with life. I'm in two minds about his novel - there is certainly some wonderful character development, but Mendelson has a stodgy, overly wrought style that just becomes too monotonous as the story progresses. The narrative seems to get bogged down in too many extraneous details; it would have been much better for Mendelson to really keep her focus on the central narrative of the changes taking place in the actual building of Morningside Heights. <br />The central characters, however, are definitely the story's strength. Most of the characters in Morningside Heights are in difficult situations made either from their own choices, or by external forces that they can't control. The most interesting characters and the centerpiece to the narrative are the sweet and unshakable Anne and Charles Braithwaite who are struggling to raise their children, while also struggling to maintain a certain lifestyle to which Anne had become accustomed. Financially stretched, and overburdened, they are forced to make difficult choices about staying in Morningside Heights. There's also Morris, the research scientist, arrogant, impetuous, who secretly likes Merrit, the social researcher, who in turn has insecurities of her own involving getting older, remaining unmarried and missing the opportunity to have children. Apart from Charles and Anne, none of the other characters where really that interesting to me, in fact, I found most of the secondary characters, by enlarge, quite self-indulgent, self-obsessed and insufferably dull.<br />I did like the way Mendelson infused the narrative with descriptions of the Upper West Side New York, giving us a potted history of the area. She also makes some interesting social comments the disparities between the rich and the poor, and how the \\"new money\\" pushes out older tenants who can no longer afford to stay.  The poor, aged and homeless line up for Merriweather's soup kitchen, while the local apartment association plots to rid the complex of the aged renters, and the tenants who can no longer meet the upkeep on their apartments. <br /> Morningside Heights starts out with good intentions, the first chapter, for example, really sets the scene giving us a history of the area for what one hopes is a riveting, intriguing story of domestic life. But as the novel progresses the Mendelson's cluttered style gets in the way, and consequently, story just becomes a rambling, longwinded and wordy mess. This is a real pity because Cheryl Mendelson probably has some really good things to say about human relationships<br />Michael	2003-10-16

Yes, this is such a deliciously sinful tale, full of unlikable, yet fun and oddly appealing characters - they're people that you just love to hate. The tone and style is very reminiscent of Kate Christensen or Steven McCauley - stories that deal artists, writers, and people living on the fringes of society who are \\"just making do.\\" Short, tightly plotted, with great character development, Burnett tells a tale of unrequited love, and the search for artistic satisfaction. <br />Set in 1984, the narrator B.K. Troop is looking back and reflecting on his strange, obsessive and tender friendship with Christopher Ireland. Life and relationships are seen through both the duel narratives of Troop and Christopher, as Troop recounts Christopher's growth, his failed and frustrated artistic endeavors and his selfish dysfunctional relationship with his synthetic like mother. Troop, although full of his own insecurities - his fear of falling in love, his cynical view of the world, his disinterest in politics - acts as a kind of cipher and witness to Christopher's coming of age and his search for meaning in life.<br />The novel opens hilariously, with a rather cynical view of George Orwell's 1984, and then we are plunged back into the real 1984 in New York, where Reagan economics ruled, AIDS was ravaging the gay community, and society was politically polarized between the left and the right. There are several quite funny scenes where Troop, smitten with love, gets involved in Gary Hart's election campaign; is dragged by Christopher to a new age exploitative workshop; and witnesses his crush on a married waitress. <br />Structurally, the novel is really interesting, because all of a sudden the narrative veers off and recounts Christopher's escapades such as with his self-absorbed wife Mary, his encounters with his mother, Grace, and his trip to Provincetown where he bed's his old school friend's wife. As the story progresses we begin to feel sorry for poor Christopher as we realize that his artistic endeavors are an apparition, and that his struggles to rise above frustration and failure are perhaps a little fruitless. This is a fun, intelligent and wry, yet bittersweet first novel. Allison Burnett is a really talented writer with a wonderfully cynical sense of humor, and in the novel Christopher, he's really managed to capture the tortured essence of artistic self-discovery. This is a must read for anyone who loves twisted tales, and quirky comedies of manners.<br />Michael	2003-10-14
US	30922103	R3HQE1AZNAHFAY	0375413820	497278203	Jamesland	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A whimsical and quirky study of the human condition.	I first read an excerpt of this book in one of Los Angeles's local free newspapers, and I was shocked to discover that the book takes place in the neighborhood of Silver Lake/Los Feliz. I'm always fascinated and intrigued to read authors depictions of local areas, so I approached Jamesland with a great deal of interest and enthusiasm. The suburbs of Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Atwater Village and the city of Glendale form a kind of urban background to the action of the novel. There are also a couple of pivotal scenes taking pace at the LA River, and Griffith Park, where Huneven really manages to capture the beauty and colour of the surrounding areas - the flora and fauna, and the sunsets with the San Gabriel Mountains in the background. The gym where Pete works out, the gourmet café where he buys his food and the bar where Alice works all have a ring of familiarity.<br />Familiarity with all the locales aside, Jamesland is still a good, quirky and whimsical read. And very reminiscent of British author Patrick Gale in style, tone and plot. Like Heneven, he too, speckles his work with dotty, eccentric, likable characters, and uses the centerpiece of church and rectory life to present his story. Transpose Los Feliz for an English country town, and you have a story that is very evocative of Gale's Facing the Tank. It really surprised me how much both authors writings are alike.<br />The question \\"how to people live in this world?\\" is the thematic heart of the novel - a world that is rife with betrayals, sadness and injustices. The three main protagonists, Pete, Alice and Helen are forced to face this central question as they are forced to re-evaluate the choices they've made and remake their lives. Huneven adeptly infuses her story with religious symbolism to make her point, and weaves throughout the narrative various ideas on religion, spirituality, the afterlife, and the relationship between our soul and our body. The story does get a bit overly \\"chatty\\" towards the end,as Huneven seems to lose her focus on the narrative. And there's a particular scene in which all the main characters have a séance in an effort to talk to the spirit of William James, which doesn't quite work. But Jamesland still provides a good, solid and authentic account of living in a neighborhood spotted with eccentric people - people trying to cope in an extraordinary world. I would advice readers who enjoyed Jamesland should also check out anything by Patrick Gale. <br />Michael	2003-10-13
US	30922103	RPA3Y6D2O94WZ	015101020X	133567778	The Fox's Walk	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A fabulous and also rather sad recreation of a bygone era	Annabel Davis-Goff has written an absolutely gorgeous novel describing the intricacies and delicacies of a bygone era. Narrated in the first person, almost sixty years after the events depicted, Alice Moore recounts her life as an eight year old at Ballydavid, her ancestral home in Ireland. David-Goff expertly infuses Alice's narrative with minutiae of a quietly peaceful domestic life with the background of the 1916 Easter uprising and the wider turmoil of the Great War. The result is a story that is intimate and personal, yet sweeping and broadly historical in tone.  Much is made of the Irish Nationalist heroes, particularly Roger Casement who is actively working for the cause for Irish Independence. We never meet Casement, but his life and struggles, as with the other figures of the time, are seen through Alice's intelligent, thoughtful eyes. Although life seems to continue as usual at Ballydavid, the Troubles, and the War in Europe are not far away, and reminders are always constant. <br />Fox's Walk is really a tale of reminiscence and loss. The great Anglo-Irish families of Ireland stuck in their stuffy Edwardian mentalities are gradually disappearing as the world changes, and embraces twentieth century modernism. And Alice's Grandmother and Aunt Kate with their rigid, austere, morally strict and socially conscious ways are as much a part of the disappearing world as the house itself. This was a time when children should be seen and not heard and when manners, good grammar and the right party invitations were of utmost importance. Davis-Goff recreates this world in such beautifully descriptive, and \\"clipped\\" prose: the tennis party, the fox hunt, the luncheons, and the dinner preparations of a privileged existence are all brought vividly to life. The author captures the simple mood of a scene - the blustery rain showers coming off the ocean; the starched blouses and dour clothes of Grandmother and Aunt Kate; the descriptions of Ballydavid - the old and slightlyshabby house and farm; the blooming hedgerows surrounding the estate; the mists that descend over the house in Autumn, and tea with cucumber sandwiches, a light sponge cake and barley water tea. <br />Although the plot in Fox's Walk is secondary, the real strength of the novel is this enormous capacity that Goff has for recreating the particulars of time and place. There's also an overwhelming sense of melancholy pervading this book, as Alice looks back with so much sadness at a life she obviously loved. Towards the end of the story she comments on a particular moment, which marks the beginning of loss, \\"an hour or two on a sunny afternoon of pure happiness of a kind we would never again find.\\" The Fox's Walk is quite a profound piece of literature - tender, delicate and astutely observed - it is a terrific read. <br />Michael	2003-10-12
US	30922103	R360JHIRH40MPQ	1400040442	437281256	Bangkok 8: A Royal Thai Detective Novel (1)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	The �flesh trade� made real.	Burdett is covering a lot of territory with Bangkok 8, and raising many interesting issues to do with our sexual mores, spiritual differences between the East and West, corruption of the rule of the law, exploitation of third world people, and the effects of American style capitalism on countries like Thailand. I had mixed emotions about this book, and in many respects, I agree with some of the other reviewers, that the novel has some good things to say but is perhaps kind of flawed as a literary thriller. <br />Sonchai, the hero of the novel is a terrifically portrayed character - complex, moral, compassionate, emotional, and weak yet also remarkably spiritual. His efforts to find and avenge the horrific murder of his partner Pichai and William Bradley really are quite riveting and involving. But, generally, I found that the story became encumbered with just too many plot twists and too much background story, resulting in an overly cluttered scenario. There's just too much of the ethnic fighting, the Chinese/Tai relationships, the Russian crime syndicates, and American/Tai relations from the Vietnam War. The conclusion seems stretched and becomes almost farcical, as Kimberley Jones, the straight-laced American agent, returns to Thailand and makes a life decision that seems to be so out of character for her.  Another major flaw in the narrative is that Bradley's murderer and the link between Bradley, and Warren - the stereotypical rich, wealthy capitalist - is exposed so early on. Although entertaining, I also had a hard time with the character of Fatima, and buying the fact that she could end up being so wealthy and exercising so much control over the other main protagonists. <br />There is, however, a lot to admire in Bangkok 8. Burdett does a fantastic job of describing the sights and sounds of the red light district of section 8. And he really makes you experience what it must feel like as a tourist wondering down one of the streets of \\"Krung Thep.\\" With a strong sense of honesty and authenticity Burdett depicts the dance bars, the sexual activity of the prostitutes, the necessities of illegal drugs - ganja and the met amphetamines - and the mainly Western clientele who frequent these neighborhoods. And the author does this without ever passing judgment on the lifestyles of the girls or their clients. <br />Burdett effectively uses Sonchai - and to a lesser extent, some of the other characters - as a window and a cipher showing that in many ways that the capitalist needs of the West are, in fact, feeding the economies and \\"flesh trades\\" of the East; each serves and to an extent needs the other. He talks a lot about the reasons why the girls turn to prostitution and why the men go to them. Countries like Thailand, while retaining their deep-seated spiritual values, are finding themselves adopting and catering ever more readily to the materialism and wealth that the West is offering. Although flawed, Bangkok 8 is still and important and serious read; and it's a story that explores dark and violent emotional terrain in city that Burdett had bought to life in disturbing and memorable ways. <br />Michael	2003-10-07

Hershon is a subtle, delicate writer and she weaves together a clever story that spans the early 70's up until 2001. The novel is slow to start, with the later sections of the story working better than the first sections. Alice Green is the central protagonist and principle narrator of this \\"quite\\" little tale of family dysfunction and miscommunication. Her mother, Charlotte is world wise, selfish, and unable to settle down. She spends months away in foreign countries trying to \\"reinvent herself\\" and dreads coming back to her children, and her suffocating monogamous marriage to her husband. <br />Alice's unraveling of her one of Mother's hidden secrets and her relationship with her disaffected and dissolute bother August makes up the core of the novel. And her journey of understanding takes her to Mexico where she finally comes to terms with her mother's estrangement and August's betrayals. Hershon's strengths as a writer is her ability to paint, in minute detail, a specific scene: there are, for example, some wonderful descriptions of the Baja Peninsula when Alice goes in her \\"road trip\\" to find August; the dusty dryness, the poverty, the dirt, the local food, and the seedy hotels are all bought vividly to life. <br />Hershon adept at creating fully realized and compassionate characters. Alice is headstrong, reclusive but with a strong sense of purpose, and she possesses the will to do what is right. August is irresponsive and disaffected, and admits that he can't handle family life while his mother Charlotte \\"is the way she is.\\" And then there's Charlotte locked into a marriage, and aching to disappear just like an escape artist. This is a tale of ordinary people trying to cope with hurt and betrayal, and its very insightful in its tone and content. The Outside of August is perhaps one of the more subtleand intuitive books of the year. <br />Michael.	2003-10-04

It's 1961 and the Berlin blockade is about to take place - where thousands of East Berliners will be forever cut off from their fellow countrymen in the West. The cold war is at its height and espionage is the name of the game. As the story opens an unexplained assassination of a foreign dignitary takes place, and as the story unravels, the pieces of the puzzle fall into place: there's a mysterious piece of film, dangerous border crossings, and an atmosphere of nervousness where no one appears quite as they seem. <br />The story is told in first person from the perspective of two people: Paul Montgomery, a banker who is stationed in West Germany, and is helping to bring foreign investment into the country; and Michael, his son, rebellious, almost crippled with polio, who together with his friends Kat and Ulrich, make a dangerous crossing behind the \\"iron curtain\\" into East Berlin to watch the annual May Day Parade. Just as Michael has been physically challenged by polio, so has East Germany been \\"crippled\\" by the Soviet regime.<br /> The author does a fabulous, almost cinema graphic job of recreating the conditions of life in East Germany during the Soviet era. The juxtaposition between the relative newfound wealth of West Germany - fuelled by American style capitalism- and the poverty of the East is startling. Carroll compares the neon signs, the sidewalk cafes, the salubrious hotels, the affluent people of West Berlin with the poverty and dissolution of the East - the burnt out shacks and huts of the East German country side which are relics of World War 2, the drabness, the lack of colour in East Berlin, the old wooden elevated trains clacking along on sub-standard rail lines, the prefab Soviet style apartment housing, the militaristic border patrol guards, and the dehumanizing aspects of the East German \\"Vopos.\\" <br />Carroll also sets the story against the wider background of world affairs and the standoff that existed between Kennedy and Khrushchev, Carroll hypothesizes that perhaps at the time the building of the Berlin Wall was a necessary evil. The irony is that this gigantic symbol of Soviet demarcation, segregation and isolation was in fact what preserved the peace; and by ending the mass outflow of refugees from East to West, the Wall took the pressure off Berlin and therefore Khrushchev and also therefore Kennedy. <br />Yet the novel is also about the personal and one young man's search for political and emotional meaning in life. Estranged from his father, and blaming his father for his mother's death because \\"his father just wasn't there for him\\"; Michael embarks on a journey that forces him to confront the truth of his feelings for his father. Both father and son, during the course of the story realize that in the face of tremendous adversity, their love for each other ultimately holds true; it's a journey of self-discovery for both. The Secret Father is an illuminating and enlightening novel, and a testament to an important era in twentieth century history. This novel will haunt you long after you have finished it.<br />Michael	2003-10-02

Complex, multi-layered, and intellectually astute, Mortals unfortunately suffers from being just far too long. Rush probably needed a good editor to cut some of the endless pages of pointless conversation and overly embellished philosophical analysis. Iris and Ray, the main protagonists are conveyed as brilliantly complex characters, and every single detail of their relationship is dissected from their sex lives to their domestic habits. Much of the story is seen from the perspective of Ray's thoughts, as he reacts to his wife's relationship with Davis Morel - a Doctor newly arrived in Botswana, and rousing \\"irreligious\\" fervor among the locals. Ray, a contract CIA agent, operating undercover as an English instructor recounts his neurosis, paranoia's and insecurities in explicit detail, as he begins to see Morel and his colleague Samuel Kerekang, as not just subversives but also the \\"enemy\\" who is trying to spread their own brand of atheism and irreligion throughout Botswana. There are pages and pages of Ray \\"free associating\\" as he tries to counter his suspicions that Iris is having an affair with Morel. <br />Although I found some aspects of the novel interesting - particularly the duel themes comparing Catholicism in the Western world with Africa - much of the novel was unfortunately rather cluttered and dull. Rush comes across as being incredibly well versed in philosophical aspects of world religion, but his effects to weave an engaging and intricate plot into his metaphysical diatribes didn't really work for me.<br />His ruminations on the state of affairs in present day Africa are very interesting. Through Ray's perspective, Rush postulates that White European Catholicism is responsible for many of the problems in Africa today - from the rampant poverty, warring tribes, to the ravaging from AIDS. Perhaps if Africa had been left on its own to develop its own \\"enlightenment\\" without European influence, Africa may have been a very different place today.<br />The novel is also peppered with Ray's gay brother's letters from back in America, written to Iris, and giving an account of life back in the West. Ray hates his brother - not through any sense of homophobia - but through a sense that his brother was the favourite in the family. His brother like most of the other people in his world is the enemy. Much of the story also recounts Iris's relationship with her sister back in California who has just become a new single mum. The lives of these two, and the decisions they make are juxtaposed with Iris and Ray's life back in Botswana. Mortals is a challenging and complex read but a book that is certainly not for everyone.<br />Michael	2003-09-29

Watson has a nice, easy, relaxed style that lends itself very well to this type of small town story. His style is at times poetic, and at times stark, as he paints a picture, and sets the story against the backdrop of the changing seasons. <br />Watson presents us with two couples whose betrayals will forever haunt them. Henry House, earthy, sexy and the owner of the apple orchard is newly married to Sonja, a Swedish immigrant. After losing their son in a terrible accident they suddenly drift apart sexually and emotionally. Ned Weaver is the controlling selfish artist who treats his wife Harriet, without respect and combs the town looking for muses for his art. When Sonja decides to model for Ned to earn some extra money, the sparks really fly when Henry finds out that other men in the town have been furtively watching the &quot;artistic&quot; exchange between artist and model. From the opening, Watson engages us in sexual politics, nasty game playing, petty betrayals, and family tensions and we get a feeling of inevitability as the story reaches its shattering climax. It is the men in the novel who come out looking bad - selfish, uncommunicative, nasty and controlling. <br />Orchard addresses the sexual hypocrisy and dysfunctional marriages of the time, while also addressing the wider themes of sexuality and art. To Ned Weaver a beautiful nude model is not necessarily a sexual being, unless he wants her to be a sexual being! And it's all on his terms. For Ned unclothing beautiful women and painting them is all about his art and work, and his work is the most important thing in his life; more important than his marriage, children or friends. Henry's challenge is to try and understand that \\"nakedness is craft and art\\"; and to transcend the idea that his wife is merely being labeled as a \\"sexual object\\" by Ned.<br />There is good character development in this novel, along with a wonderfully adept use of metaphor. Watson really makes us appreciate the tension and sensuality of a single action - the peeling of sunburn, the eating of an apple, the removal of slinky negligee  - and he does this so economically. Deftly weaving together imagery of four very different lives, Orchard could almost be called a literary painting. This is an interesting and quite moving work.   <br />Michael	2003-09-27

This remarkable novel is structured around the four seasons, and we see the David's journey through the perspective of each changing season. Each section gives us just a little more insight into David's journey, as he gains confidence and gradually adjusts to living in a foreign culture.  His story is fictional, but it could almost read as a non-fiction travelogue, and I suspect that much of what is written was gleaned from Gambone's own experiences traveling through China and living in Beijing. <br />Living in Boston, stuck is a rut, pining for his dead boyfriend; David takes the initiative and applies for a job at a Western medical clinic in Beijing. Then his life changes forever as he confronts parts of himself, and goes on an exciting journey of self-discovery to become \\"whole again.\\"Gambone masterfully takes us on David's journey from the nervous, worrying pre-flight preparation to the anxiousness and excitement of his first night and weeks in China. All the sights, sounds and smells of Beijing are seen through the prism of David's eyes - the eyes of an inexperienced and somewhat hesitant traveler. The trash on the streets, the drab colours of the University dorm that David is forced to sleep in, the food, the endless smog, the crowds of people cycling to work, the market stalls, the militaristic boy soldiers, the warmth of the people, and the furtiveness of Chinese gay life are all bought vividly to life. <br />As David becomes more comfortable with the city, he also searches out the closeted gay life, which he knows must exist in the city. At night he cruises the local park in the hope of making contact with men; he finds the Ta Ta Club, a local watering hole for gay men, and he goes to a bathhouse, where gays are reported to furtively meet. During his year in Beijing he meets many interesting people and makes many good friends. And he also finds time for love with Bo, a handsome young Chinese artist, who makes him understand the limitless possibilities for love again. <br />Anyone, gay or straight who has picked up and left familiarity, particularly anyone who had lived in another culture for an extended length of time, will find a lot to admire in this novel. The East/West divide is ever present, particularly the East's cultural attitudes to homosexuality. Traditional \\"family values\\" are ever present in this society: Auntie Chen, David's work mate constantly asks why he is not married and many of the young gay men David meets confess to him that they are under pressure from their parents to find a girl and marry. But the book also presents the the boarder theme of the new China - a China that's rapidly opening its borders to the West, and stumbling towards open markets and capitalism with differing degrees of success. In one important scene David looks out over his apartment building and stares with a mixture of wonder and shame at \\"nothing but tall bland buildings, as far as the eye can see, pillars of reinforced concrete, heaps of steel. This is the new China - wondrous and shameful.\\" Beijing is an insightful, thought provoking book on loneliness, longing, cultural dislocation and a country that is undergoing rapid change.<br />Michael	2003-09-25

The main character of this story, however, is probably just the opposite. Sheltered from gay life for years, and settled in a cushy government job with a cozy circle of drinking buddies, Joel doesnt have much idea of what the world is like outside of Dupont Circle, the Hill Club, and reading the Congressional Record.  Poor Joel, he looks longingly at the Chelsea boys with their muscular bodies and their body piercings and he just feels as though life has left him behind. After his long term lover, Sam leaves him after 15 years, he not only has to cope with, eating too much and getting fat, and the ant-gay legislation going through Congress, but he develops an obsession with a picture of a man in a sexy swimsuit from a magazine that came out back in 1964. <br />Man About Town is remarkably whimsical and tenderhearted in its portrayal of an aging gay man, who feels as though hes let life pass him by. This story is good, not just for an insiders view of the goings on in Washington, and the cynical descriptions of how legislation is formed through the lobbying of special interest groups. But it is also good for showing what many aging gay men are going through, or have gone through. Joels obsession with the swim suited man in the magazine Man About Town, is an attempt to recapture his past, and to come to terms with the fact that  yes, he could have done things differently. Joels journey is touching, comic and deftly observed, as he questions his relationship with Sam, and his life as he drastically tries to get back into the dating game by dating men again, and of course, running off to Zippers Bar every chance he can get. <br />Ive never been to Washington, but Merlis bought the city, and the goings on in Capital Hill vividly to life for me. He has a nice, easy economical style, and an excellent ear for natural conversation. The secondary characters that weave in and out of Joels life are also deftly observed: Kevin, Sams new boyfriend is young, insecure and dresses like a rapper; Andrew, Joels colleague, ambitious and still in the closet, and prepared to compromise his principles for his career; and then theres Michael, young, black, and confessing to like older men like Joel. Theres much to enjoy in this book, as Merlis takes us on a very special journey with a rather ordinary but wise man.<br />Michael	2003-09-24

O'Hagan deftly whisks us away to the picturesque island of Bute and the beautiful sounding town of Rothesay. Growing up in Australia, and being familiar with British television or \\"telly\\" as the British like to call it, there was much in this novel that was familiar to me and so much of it bought back memories: the Basil Brush Show, sausage rolls, LWT, and Opportunity Knocks etc. O'Hagan really brings back to life the 70's TV variety shows and the people who starred on them. And there's no doubt that his research of the period is absolutely meticulous.<br />Personality is so much more than an account of one young girl's rise to fame and fortune as a \\"Cilla Black\\" style variety singer. The Italian immigrant experience - which I must confess I knew nothing about - the terrible disease of bulimia and anorexia nervosa, the meaning of family ties, and the culture of celebrity in Britain are all issues that O'Hagan tackles in this work with differing success. The many multiple story lines and secondary character confessions do, at times, clutter and stifle the central chronicle of Maria's rise to stardom and her battle with eating disorders. However, the secondary characters are still beautifully developed: Rosa, Maria's mother, spends her days running the family \\"fish and chip\\" ship in Rothesay, supportive of her daughter, but also regretful of what \\"might have been\\"; Lucia, the Italian immigrant grandmother who holds terrible family secrets from World War 2; Mrs. Gaskell the work obsessed entertainment agent who drives Maria to the brink of no return, and Michael, Maria's childhood friend who falls in love with Maria and comes to her rescue later in the novel. There are also many other characters equally rich in detail. <br />O'Hagan is also a wonderfully descriptive writer and he experiments with different styles throughout the novel - he uses newspaper reports, the epistolary form, and various chapter-likemonologues to reflect the characters' inner-most thoughts, and to help tell us the story of Maria, her struggles, and her journey to stardom. This works well in some sections and not in others, and sometimes the novel becomes cluttered with too many subplots. There's also a rather unnecessary twist involving a stalker in part three, which seems hurried and tacked on, and at times, particularly in part three, the story meanders too far from the central plot. But this novel is still worth reading and the fact that the author can authentically transport you to Great Britain in the 1970's and present an era in such vivid detail shows tremendous talent and literary creativity. Anyone who grew up watching 70's British variety shows and has an appreciation for them will just love this book!<br />Michael.	2003-09-23

This first novel is not only a powerful drama but also very informative - I didn't know that there was an East Indian community living in postcolonial Kenya. This story tells you a lot about Indian culture, and what it is like to grow up in a city like Mombassa. We are constantly peppered with images from Ali's childhood, and we really get a sense of the innocence and traditionalistic life that existed there particularly after the British left. Dhalla's work is almost like stream of consciousness - we are constantly blasted with Ali's thoughts and feelings as he battles to come to terms with his failed relationships with Richard, Nelson and Bill. What saves this novel from being an over-the-top melodrama is the way Dhalla presents his different themes: coming to terms with one's cultural inheritance, family relationships, HIV/AIDS, coming out, casual sex, racism within minority groups, and loyalty and betrayal in friendships. And he brings the Los Angles/Hollywood gay scene to life in a way that hasn't been done since John Rechy: the drugs, drinking, the nightclubs, the body fascism, and the plasticity of much of the scene are presented in vivid and spot-on detail.<br />The story adeptly moves backwards and forwards in time from Ali's childhood in Kenya where we learn about his traditional Indian childhood, his relationships with boys, and his overbearing and overprotective mother, or \\"Mummy\\" as he calls her, to the present, where Ali cruises Santa Monica Boulevard on the weekends, searching for true love and his \\"ideal\\" man. Ali is such a complex, conflicted and multi-faceted character. Torn between the traditional East Indian culture of Kenya - where men are expected to marry and father children, and gay men are often closeted - to the modern, urban sophisticated world of Los Angeles, where gay sex is available for the taking, and life is dictated by the Santa Monica nightclubs, saunas and sex clubs. Ali is looking for love in an environment that he thinks is harsh and impersonal, and the final scene in the Hollywood sex club where he realizes that he can't go on living like this will leave you breathless. Yes - the sex in this novel is powerful, raw, and piercing, but never gratuitous.  In fact, Dhalla has infused his story with a powerful, all embracing eroticism.<br />This is also a story of Los Angeles, and how a single gay man from an immigrant community copes in a big, modern city. How does Ali reconcile the needs of his mother, and the powerful ties of his cultural heritage with the needs of his friends, lovers, and life in modern Los Angeles? This is the thematic core of the book and Ali's journey throughout, and I think that at the end of the novel he has come along way in figuring out how he's going to do this. There is no doubt that Ghalib Dhalla is an enormously talented writer, and he's given us an insight into a little publicized part of the gay community. I just hope that we will be able to experience more of Dhalla's work in the years to come. <br />Michael	2003-09-15

Her characters deftly weave in and out of a story arc that is set in two time periods  - 1987 and the year 2000. The story starts out dramatically with a traffic accident and the introduction of the two main protagonists Lowell and Samantha, the child survivors of an Air France hijacking.  Then novel turns into what is literally a literary jigsaw puzzle as Lowell and Samantha try to piece together the truth behind the hijacking and the secret of the accident.<br /> I love the way Hospital readily switches from the present where Samantha, Lowell and the others from the Phoenix Group are trying to come to terms with what has happened, to the past where Tristian and Genevieve are about to board to the plane for New York. The best part of the novel, however, is the actual hijacking, which is told in such graphic, violent detail, and with so much authenticity that you really feel as though you are there on the plane. This is probably the most riveting and well-written chapter in the book, as Hospital conveys the continual take-off and landings against a backdrop of claustrophobic heat. It is also interesting that the actual hijacking section is seen though Tristian's point of view, as he is only one of a handful of passengers on the plane who survives. There are many twists and turns in the plot, as the pieces of the puzzle gradually come together and we learn whom the shadowy figures of Salamander, Sirocco are.<br />The last half of Due Preparations for the Plague, however, is far too dialogue driven and stuffed with pretentiously dull sections on the nature of warfare. We don't really need to know the ins and outs of chemical warfare and the effects of saran gas on the nervous system; these passages simply detract from the main plot and characters. And we could also have been spared pages and pages of insufferable ramblings on the history of war - from Ancient Troy to Carthage, to Napoleon's France. I can understand that in a post 9/11 world, stories dealing with international terrorism, particularly terrorism dealing with Muslim extremism, are going to be told, which is fine, but we don't need stories on this subject that are over stuffed with literary pretentiousness. Due Preparations for the Plague is trying too hard to be something it is not, and unfortunately, in my opinion it is nothing more than \\"dressed up\\" pulp fiction.<br />Michael	2003-09-12

And I had problems with this story. There is no doubt that Joseph O'Connor is a fabulous writer, and his recreation of the 1840's is astounding. His style lends the work a sense of authenticity, reinforced by the author's intimate knowledge of the period and also his evocative, realistic prose. There was, however, wasn't much to keep me interested in this book, at least to read it until the end. The novel starts off brilliantly with a wonderful depiction of the first night on the ship. O'Connor's vivid descriptions and use of metaphor are astounding, but the rest of the book just doesn't live up to the wonderful atmosphere that he created in his first chapter.<br />I found the characters to be typical historical stock stereotypes with a kind of one dimensionality that I found frustrating - <BR>The upper class blustery Lord Merridith, the beautiful, whimsical Mary Duane, and the angst ridden Pius Mulvey. I can appreciate the way O'Connor weaves the back stories of these characters into the narrative, but to me the story kept deviating from life on the ship; and I wanted to get back to what was happening on the voyage. <br />The descriptions of the peasants in steerage were suitably horrific and O'Connor really presented a realistic account of what it would have been like to travel to the New World in such conditions. He also presents a vivid account of the poverty and starvation that existed in Ireland at the time. But this has been covered so much in other fiction and also in popular movies such as Gangs of New York. Perhaps I need to give this book another try at a later date or maybe just give up reading historical fiction all together.	2003-09-10
US	30922103	R3CTDYIUUCNX13	0393047644	510021043	The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad	Books	3	11	13	N	N	An interesting lesson on world politics	This is an excellent account of the origins of democracy, and an informative treatise on the state of worldwide democracy, both liberal and illiberal, at the moment.  Zakaria deftly talks about the history of the Western style democracy tracing its roots from the Ancient Romans, through Western Europe, and the separation of church and state. Most interesting was Zakaria's account of the rise of the bourgeoisie in Great Britain in the nineteenth century, and the political and economic power that was given to them. He contrasts this Continental Europe and shows how aristocracy and centralization hampered a similar movement towards economic and political freedom. Zakaria talks about communism, fascism, theocracies, and totalitarian societies that exist, and have existed worldwide, and he does this with authority and enthusiasm.<br />Zakaria also highlights the central problem of the Middle East. Many of the countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the Gulf states have been so busy accumulating so much wealth through oil, that they have failed to effectively tax their people, and have therefore created illiberal, non-functioning institutions, and, therefore, governments that do not effectively represent the people. Because they haven't had to actually work and earn their wealth these counties, with their corrupt, authoritarian governments, do not feel obliged to offer their citizens anything in return. Zakaria echo's Thomas Friedman's concerns, that they are like spoiled children, who have been given momentous oil wealth, and lots of leisure time!<br />The author is also particularly harsh on president Musharraf's Pakistan and Russia under Vladimir Putin. He likens Putin to a \\"super president\\" which surprised me because I thought that Putin was doing quite a good job at \\"liberalizing\\" Russia, and setting it on the track to economic wealth. I can understand why he would feel the way he does about Musharraf, as the man did take control of the country in an undemocraticway through the military. Of course, maybe it was for the best when one considers the current and past volatility of the country.  Much of Zakaria's work has been covered in depth by other geo-political pundits such as Noreena Hertz's The Silent Takeover, Daniel Yergin's The Commanding Heights, and of course, Tom Friedman's Longitudes and Attitudes. But the difference with Zakaria is that he also includes an in-depth analysis of the state of liberal democracy in the United States.  In this age of terrorism, international free trade agreements, globalism and politicians' preferences for special interest groups, Americans are in danger of losing their democracy, as they know it. Zakaria fears that \\"liberal\\" democracy is being hijacked by \\"popularism\\" and the respected democratic institutions of the past that have helped build the country and secure the rule the law have been gradually dismantled and discredited.<br />Zakaria's style does at times tend to meander, and he doesn't necessarily keep to the point, but his arguments about the current state of the world, including the problems with Iraq, Latin America, and the Dictators of the Third World are indeed illuminating and enlightening.  This isn't the best book on geo-politics - you need to read Noreena Hertz's The Silent Takeover for that - but it is still an interesting and provocative read.<br />Michael.	2003-09-07
US	30922103	RA6GSDHIYL281	0316168688	744408823	The Dogs of Babel	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Nice, eloquent style, but had problems with the cruelty.	I'm in two minds about this book. I read it in just over a day; I couldn't put it down, but I also have serious reservations about a book with such graphic depictions of cruelty to animals. I know that the book was a work of fiction, and that the scenes depicted are never gratuitous, but I question whether the rather silly sub-plot of Wendell Hollis, the underground dog society, and Dog J was really all that essential to the story. <br />Parkhurst has a nice, economical and elegant style, and her pacing is tight. When Paul returns home and finds that her wife has died under strange circumstances, we are plunged right into the mystery, and the tale unwinds quickly at a deft pace. Although, not central to the story, the outcome of Lexy's death, however, will come as no surprise to the reader. The real story is the astute observation of a relationship full of dysfunction, and a modern marriage that is unfortunately seems to be doomed by a lack of communication.<br />This is also a story of grief and sadness, as we realize that Lexy's needs as a wife, and possibly as a mother will never be fulfilled, and that Paul will never be able to recapture the love that he felt for Lexy. And then there is gorgeous Lorelei, the real star of the story, and the character who possibly holds the key to Lexy's death. The story effectively jumps between the present, as Paul mourns and tries to come to terms with the death of his true love, and the past, as we witness their meeting, courtship and eventual marriage. During this time learn much about Lexy; she's spontaneous - particularly when she drags Paul off on a first date to Disney World lasting a week - and she's also an artist, a lover, and loyal to Lorelei and Paul, but she's also seems to be incredibly insecure and unhappy with the world. <br />I had problems with some of the other plot twists involving Lady Arabelle, and a ridiculous subplot involving a ghost that Lexy is obsessed with in New Orleans. And I still don't know whatis the true meaning of all the symbolism, or indeed whether there is actually meant to be any symbolism! Are the masks that Lexy perpetually paints a way of shutting out reality? Are they her method of communicating with Paul? Is her obsession with the death masks towards the end of the story, her cry for help? The story ends up being kind of vague and muddled as Parkhurst tries to cram so much into this story. Consequently, I found this book kind of disappointing - read The Dogs of Babel only if you want a fast and quick read.<br />Michael	2003-09-02
US	30922103	R37WZNTFI2SX1D	0312209355	59052820	War Against the Animals: A Novel	Books	5	10	10	N	N	An intense and provocative masterpiece.	We've anxiously waited three years for another Paul Russell novel, and luckily he doesn't disappoint. Just as The Coming Storm addressed the controversial issues of underage gay sex, War Against the Animals also addresses the similar theme of the kind of relationships older gay men can have with younger men who are struggling to come out. Both novels are such wonderful and intricate studies of modern gay America, that readers will be wondering just what Russell will come up with next! War against the Animals is indeed worth waiting for, as it's an astounding piece of work and a fine literary achievement. Russell writes with a mature, and serious voice - a voice that is really needed and rarely found within the current dearth of quality fiction for gay men.<br />The story shifts so dramatically between the two main protagonists, Cameron Barnes and Jesse Vanderhof and the story moves so explicitly towards its inevitable climax, that the reader is left feeling emotionally exhausted. Russell does a wonderful job of addressing the needs and issues of older HIV positive gay men; Cameron is lonely, wealthy, and solitary, and wistful of his life spent with his one true love, who has died of AIDS. He meets Jessie - young, confused, rebellious, and a \\"red neck\\" - they develop a tender, kind of mismatched friendship, which seems to flourish against all odds. Russell does a great job of telling the story from each character's perspective, and many of the secondary characters are startlingly realistic. There's Perry - young, sexy and provocative; Jesse's brother Kyle - rough, suspicious of Jesse's sexuality and resentful of the changes taking place around him, and Cameron's friend Max - ambitious, politically active in local government, with a drive to change the community for the better. War against the Animals also has some astute familial observations, and I was amazed that even though her husband had just died, Jesse and Kyle's mother was so detached and unaware of her sons'problems.<br />War against the Animals is not just a story of unintended friendship and a young under-educated man trying to find his way in a hostile and confused world. It is also a story of a \\"war\\": a war of class, education and money - a war of different worldviews, and a war over sexuality. The politics of small town life is one of the wider themes of the novel. Older communities are changing and the disparate poorer people are being pushed out as the wealthy, many of them young affluent gay men, are moving in, buying up the housing stock and gradually remaking the communities. Russell addresses these issues and themes with resounding honesty and compassion, and paints a beautiful picture of a world undergoing unstoppable change. Russell's command of the language, his use of metaphor and symbolism and his vivid descriptions of the natural world are unsurpassed in contemporary American literature. This is a fine piece of literary fiction from one of America's greatest authors, and one of the literary highlights of the year. <br />Michael	2003-08-31

I became familiar with Melinda Haynes's work a few years ago when I picked up the challenging Mother of Pearl. I can't say that I enjoyed Mother of Pearl, so it was with some trepidation and a certain amount curiosity that I picked up a copy of Willem's Field. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this novel, and I'm shocked that's it's not getting more notoriety. This is wonderfully eloquent piece of work  - just gorgeous. Haynes has a beautiful, rolling lyrical style that just melts over the page - you can tell that she's just passionate about the South. There is so much attention to detail here, and just so much to take in that a second reading would certainly do this book justice. <br />Willem's Field is far more character driven than plot driven, but this doesn't detract from the story at all. Haynes beautifully weaves both plot and character to satisfying effect. She has an ear for natural dialogue and is also able to portray intimate details of small town life, along with the environment  - fields sounding the town of Purvis, Mississippi - and the major characters' intimate domestic habits. The dialogue will have you laughing and crying - moving from the absurdly acerbic and funny to the sad and heart rendering; this is a real achievement for Melinda Haynes.<br />The characters are startling in their three dimensionality: the aging Eilene, lonely and bitter over her \\"lot\\" in life and resentful of her fat lazy son, Sonny; Eilene's eldest son, Bruno, suffering a spinal injury from the Vietnam war, caught in an unhappy and discontented marriage to his wife Leah; and Leah herself, feeling deserted and alone, left to care for the farm and ponder with bitterness the dysfunctional relationship she's had with her eccentric parents. And then there's Willem, old, tired and suffering terminal panic attacks, and returning to Purvis from Colorado, to reconnect with his old life and search for home and happiness. There are many wonderfully eccentric and \\"real\\" characters and all of them, both major and minor, are searching for acceptance while trying to get by in a world that seems harsh and distant. The depiction of these characters is so authentic that you can imagine knowing these people or having them live next door to you, and it was such a wonderful opportunity to spend some time with them.<br />Willem's Field is also a great depiction of the 1970's, deftly recreating an era of Nixon, rock music, bell-bottoms, and the innocence of a country rocked by the effects of the Vietnam War. This is definably one the best books of the year, and Melinda Haynes's finest and most nuanced book to date. Five stars. <br />Michael	2003-08-25
US	30922103	R11IRG1ZAEUOZI	1565123794	835004256	The Canal House	Books	2	2	8	N	N	Not much passion and suspense for me	One of the early reviews for The Canal House said that it mixes \\"high stakes suspense\\" with \\"erotic intrigue\\"....\\"a gripping storyline\\" rich in detail. Well, I managed to get about half way through this novel, and I didn't feel there was much erotic intrigue or high stake suspense going on. I lost interest in The Canal House very quickly, and I think the reason is Lee's writing style. This book almost reads like a grade school term paper, and I'm not sure whether Lee meant this as a deliberate journalistic function, or it's just the way he happens to write. Either way, I found it far too tedious and simplistic for my taste. <br />The subject matter and the story of foreign journalists in war torn zones should make for a really interesting and compelling story, and I found the parallel stories of Nicky and Julia to be sort of interesting - I was surprised to learn how much of the aid to the third world comes from bored rich western capitalists with a lot of time and money on their hands. But I just felt that Lee hasn't done a good enough job at really transporting us to places like Uganda, and creating a compelling and involving sense of immediacy. I also had a problem with the narrative form; telling a story through the shifting perspectives of different people has been done so often  - Michael Cunningham did it in A Home at the End of the World - and so many other authors are currently doing it, that it's beginning to become tedious and unimaginative. I just don't think Lee is a subtle enough writer to carry this off, but maybe that's the point - war isn't subtle and he's trying to reflect this in his writing. Anyway, I was kind of disappointed with this book, but I do hope Lee continues to write and tell important stories, as I'm sure there is a market for his work.<br />Michael	2003-08-21
US	30922103	R2F2V31VG4RMY0	0684844494	635162915	Clara : A Novel	Books	5	22	22	N	N	A passionate and vivid love story	Janice Galloway's Clara is such a complex and modern character, particularly for the period she lived in. Galloway portrays her as such a strong, independent woman with a fiercely stubborn streak, yet also having such compassion and tenderness towards her husband Robert. Clara arranges her concert tours, organizes the household, writes her own music, teaches students, tends to her ailing husband, and manages to produce eight children! No easy feat. Whether her independent streak was forced on her by the shortcomings of Robert, or by her fiercely dictatorial father is unclear. Galloway hints that it was probably a mixture of both.  <br />During all this time Clara's life was bound up with her husband's and they were separated only by the exigencies of her profession. She devoted herself not only to his society, but also the to bringing out of his music much of which owed its reputation to her. The story gives us a powerful overview of her life from her time as a child and a musical protégée under the tutelage of her strict and authoritarian father. Then we move onto her meeting, strained courtship and eventual marriage to Schumann. The novel is also notable for introducing us to many of the other composers of the period - Chopin, Brahms and Mendelssohn - all friends and respected colleagues of Clara and Robert Schumann.  <br />Clara is a beautifully and passionately written love story, and Galloway writes in a style that blasts us with images of their profound and very deep love. Her work is extremely ambitious in its scope - using threads from their music, letters, diaries, and itineraries, and also incorporating a type of \\"stream of consciousness\\" where we are see into the minds of the main protagonists. Galloway creates piece of work that is absolutely breathtaking in scope and complexity, and a real challenge to read. <br />But the novel is so much more than a love story. The reader constantly is bombarded with images from the Victorian era: the musical community of the 1800.s; the sites of Leipzig, Vienna and the other cities if the area; the sounds of the performances; the smells of the cities; the sexual attitudes, childbirth, and the domestic and household life of the period. Galloway's research is indeed meticulous and I'm sure the reader will find a lot to appreciate in this fine piece of work. Clara isn't an easy novel to read, but I'm sure that if the average reader sticks with it, they will be richly rewarded and they will finish having an interesting insight into the life of the wife of one of the world's greatest composers.<br />Michael	2003-08-19

I got so involved in this novel I read it in almost one day! The Palestine Affair is an immensely fast and enjoyable novel, and also very British in its form and content. This isn't that surprising, since Jonathan Wilson was born and educated in England. In fact, the style and setting reminded me of Paul Bowles' The Sheltering Sky, with the theme of strangers trying to come to terms with being in a strange and foreign land. And like the Sheltering Sky, The Palestine Affair is a tightly plotted, gorgeously written, and sophisticated saga, which uses the immense beauty of the Middle East to startling effect. The struggles of the three main protagonists of the story - Joyce, her lover Robert and her husband Mark Bloomberg - are portrayed with a deft understanding, emotion and compassion. The only problems I had with the story was that I didn't quite believe the fact that Joyce, a nineteen twenties girl, would so readily enter into an affair with Robert, while she still seemed so devoted and committed to her husband. And I also felt that some of the supporting characters tended to fall into stock stereotypes, and they weren't developed as well the three main characters.<br />Despite this though, The Palestine affair, is still an interesting and exciting mixture of three part love affair, espionage thriller, and murder mystery, using the history of Jews, Arabs and the English occupation of Palestine as a vivid backdrop - there is no doubt that Wilson has an immense passion and cultural understanding of this part of the world and it shows in his work. And like the artist Mark Bloomberg, Wilson writes as though he is painting a scene, and he really succeeds in bringing the sounds, smells and gorgeous visual imagery of Jerusalem and the surrounding areas to life, just Mark tries to do in his paintings. Some of the descriptions of the desert are stunning, lushly detailed and incredibly cinematic - just beautiful to read.<br />This story also does a good job in evoking the kinds of troubles and religious conflicts that were facing Palestine at the time of the British occupation, and it does a fine job showing the \\"culture clash\\" between the Jews, Arabs and the occupying British, and the British's almost flippant attitude towards the different cultures of the area. You can see how many of today's troubles between the Israelis and the Palestinians have been festering for years and also how they both seemed to seethe under British rule. If you really want to have a cultural escape and by educated about this part of the world, you should read this book. But The Palestine Affair also works as a good, solid piece of work and a first rate literary thriller. <br />Michael	2003-08-14

It will also shatter all your preconceived notions about low wage earners because Ehrenreich deftly shows that the \\"working poor\\" are making an invaluable contribution to society. Through Nickel and Dimed, Ehrenreich has really solidified many of the problems facing the \\"underclass\\" of America. She raises many important issues in this book, particularly the disparities that exist between low wage earners and the more affluent middle classes in America. <br />Through her adventures in waitressing in Key West, scrubbing in Maine and retailing in Minnesota we get to see a side of life and a way of living that unfortunately analogous to many Americans. Her story is, at times, funny and heartfelt, but it will also make you sad and angry at the conditions that she's forced to endure. Ehrenreich's style is easy to read and flows well and she has a remarkable sense of humor which will really make you laugh at some of her observations at the jobs she has to do - cleaning toilets of the affluent in Maine is just one example! <br />It's not just the economic gulf that exists in America that will shock you; it's also the way that Corporate America manipulates and belittles their employees and potential employees through creepy personality tests, drug tests and orientations seminars, which are really little more than illegal brainwashing. Ehrenreich also shows the remarkable lack of \\"choices\\" that low paid workers have and that getting access to some kind of government assistance, be it food stamps, emergency money etc., getting this access can be fraught with topographical and bureaucratic problems, for example, she has problems getting help in Maine when she really needs it.   <br />A low wage earner really need two have two jobs to survive, that is, if you want to be able to eat AND pay the rent. She also presents the economic disparity that exists between rents and wages, as the working poor are gradually being shut out of rental markets - witness her time in Minnesota where vacancies for rent were next to impossible to find. It's also no longer enough to work hard - working hard doesn't guarantee you a life of luxury and comfort and these days you have to have an angle and make money work for you through investments etc. Ehrenreich also stresses the importance of unionism, and that although unions aren't perfect; they are still the only protection that exists between workers and managers. Her time retailing shows the startling disempowerment and non-unionist attitude that many young employees have. <br />Ehrenreich provides no easy solutions to the problem of too-low minimum wages, and she ends up raising more questions than she answers. This is an important book, a powerful story, and a must read for everyone. <br />Michael	2003-08-12
US	30922103	R3LFGV8QFRKKVG	0684869357	54338427	Conditions of Faith: A Novel	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Some vivid descriptions but generally a rather dull read	My sister recommended me this book, and I was looking forward to read something that at least was partly set in my native Australia. And the thought of reading a recently published work that would be reminiscent of My Brilliant Career was very inviting. This is a novel of choices, and the price we pay for making certain choices in our lives. And I think the novel does show that in the 1920's choices for women and how well they could control their lives were quite limited. <br />A condition of Faith, however, was a big disappointment and unfortunately a rather dull and lack-luster read. I had a real problem with Miller's style - his short, sharp sentences didn't allow the narrative to really flow. Lots of time is given to description of what the characters are doing in their domestic lives, but there is little if any description of their internal workings - their psyches or their motivations. There is no doubt that Miller has done a mountain of research to really recreate the period in Melbourne, Paris and North Africa, but I think he just gets too bogged down in period description without letting the characters' motivations tell the story.  I also didn't buy the Emily's central motivation: would a well educated, upper middle class Australian girl like Emily from the 1920's impetuously jump into a sudden marriage with a Frenchman? And would she have done what she did with the Bishop in the Crypt in Chartres?  I found this unconvincing; therefore, I found the rest of the story equally implausible. <br />As everything in the novel is filtered through Emily's eyes, we really get to know little about the other characters and what motivates them - we know that Georges is driven by obtaining the tender to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but we never really get to know him and how he deeply feels about Emily - he comes across as stock stereotypical Frenchman, committed to Emily as long as she plays dutiful wife and mother. <br />To be fair there are some good things aboutConditions of Faith. I quite liked the scenes in Tunisia - Miller really managed to capture the intense heat and atmosphere of that part of the world. He brings this part of the world vividly to life, particularly with the sub-plots involving Arab nationalism and the history of Carthage, yet these subplots kind of fall flat and never really go anywhere. And his descriptions of Emily painfully studying in the Library in Paris are indeed riveting and heart breaking; you really get a sense of her inner conflict and struggles. It was also nice to have a history lesson on the development of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. <br />Generally though, Conditions of Faith is a pretty dull and flat read. If you want to read some Australian literature that is really representative of the Australian psyche, read some Martin Boyd, particularly the novel A Difficult Young Man. <br />Michael	2003-08-11

And it's really easy to see when reading this book how terrorist groups can really gain a foothold in these failed states where lawlessness and warlords thrive. The book is indeed a marvelous description of the tragic history of a country that has suffered so much throughout history, and Hosseini's solid descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of the country really bring this tragic history to the forefront. Hosseini's style is economical and elegant, and moves along at a nice breezy pace; and he never becomes bogged down in any unnecessary description. <br />There is no doubt that the Kite Runner is a beautifully told story of betrayal and redemption, and I couldn't help thinking how cinematic this story could be; it's just crying out to be made into a movie as it has all the ingredients. This good, sold read has everything - a doomed childhood friendship, family loyalties, a hidden family secret, a hurried escape to a different land, a battle with a cold, harsh bureaucratic system, and an evil regime which stifles individual freedoms. I thought that the depiction of the childhood friendship of Amir and Hassan's set against the beauty of pre-war Afghanistan was beautifully conveyed - Hosseini has really managed the capture the innocence of childhood friendship, and he's cleverly used &quot;kite flying&quot; as a symbol for this friendship.<br />This story is also about the immigrant experience, and how families, fleeing a terrible situation, are forced the make a new home in a new and strange land. Of course, there is nothing new about this aspect of the story, but Hosseini, imbues his characters, especially Babba with such love, respect and vulnerability, that you can't help but look at their plight from Afghanistan with a fresh perspective. <br />Some of the plot developments the story become a little far fetched particularly towards the end of the novel, as some of Amir's coincidental meetings with other characters strain the boundaries of reality. But generally, The Kite Runner is a good, solid first novel that is told with honesty and passion. And I would recommend this book for anyone who really wants to see the human cost that the Taliban, and the Soviets for that matter, had on Afghanistan society. <br />Michael	2003-08-07

This book absolutely blew me away, and is probably one of the best books of the year so far. Byers has a gorgeously simplistic, elegant and, at the same time economical writing style that just sweeps you along. Not only does he manage to recreate such vivid realistic characters, but also develop a story that just commands your attention. What a talent Michael Byers is with an epic, intellectual and beautiful style that is very reminiscent of Michael Cunningham and Julia Glass. So convincing is Byers portrayal of suburban, American middle-class life that you could be mistaken for thinking that Henry, Isla, and their two children, Sandra and Darren are real people. I must confess that although I new what Hickman's disease was, I knew very little about it, so this book was a real education for me. And Byers doesn't swamp us with unnecessary scientific jargon on genetics - he gives us just enough information so that we get the drift of what is going on. The story is just a heartbreaking in its account of what people like William and his family go through in trying to cope with this illness. <br />Much of the novel takes place in 1999 in Seattle during the dot.com boom, and one gets a real sense of the money that people were making during this time. The story also gives us a sense that this excess can't continue forever, and that the bubble must eventually burst. I think this novel works on many, many levels, provoking serious thought about modern American life - its excesses, and America's obsession with money and materialism. The novel also provides a stunning portrayal of the Seattle, which at the time faced an uncertain future with lots of civic change taking place. Through Henry, Byers effectively juxtaposes materialistic obsessions with the amazing abilities that humans can have for love, compassion and self-sacrifice and the lengths that people will go to show this. Byers places us in Henry's position and asks us the central question of what lengths would we go to save a life -a life that is probably doomed anyway. The novel also gives us an interesting insight into the legalities of gene research, and much of the story is devoted to the somewhat cold-hearted buying and selling of genetic stock.<br />Of all the characters though, it is Isle who is perhaps the most interesting. As a new immigrant from Austria, she comes to America with a fresh eye and some interesting and funny views on the country. All the characters, both major and minor, have something to offer this story and the reader. But it is Isle's path towards self-discovery that resonates long after you have finished the book. Long for This World is a remarkable piece of work!<br />Michael	2003-08-03

Walters in much of her later work has a tendency to be place too many fragmentary scenes into her work, rather than letting each scene flow effortlessly into another. And there is very little suspense for a novelist who is supposed to be renowned as a writer of suspense; indeed, the story kind of peters out towards the end, and the main culprit in the murder of Aisla doesn't become that much of a surprise. It's also not that much of a surprise when we find out why the murder took place and who the accomplice is.<br />I think Walters strength is in her character studies of the upper class British, and for me the two most entertaining, and over-the-top characters were undoubtedly Eleanor and Prue. Their viciousness and vindictiveness, not only towards their husbands but also to James and to almost everyone else in the town, was just wonderfully conveyed. In all fairness the story IS packed with some really smart dialogue - there's lots of really acid sparring between Eleanor and Prue and their respective husbands. Walters is on top of her game when she's conveying the frustrations and almost frigid depictions of the English moneyed class. She also has fun with social commentary  - this book was written at a time when the English were really going at loggerheads over the issues of whether or not to ban fox hunting, and there were many protests in London by the parties who were both for and against it, and I like the way Walters morphs this kind of comment into her stories. However, I wouldn't recommend Fox Evil if your looking for something new and fresh by this writer - go and reread The Breaker instead. <br />Michael	2003-07-31

Mann, he's an extremely competent and very entertaining writer. His ear for dialogue and character is spot on, and his ability to tell a character driven story is really very good. Mann is probably one of the best gay writers around at the moment. However, I was a little disappointed in Where the Boys Are, particularly after reading the wonderful The Men from the Boys. A part of the problem is that I just didn't buy the fact that an intelligent well-rounded guy like Jeff would automatically throw himself into the vacuous circuit party scene at his age, and after everything that he went through in the previous novel; his actions where just fundamentally unrealistic to me. I also didn't buy Lloyd's seduction by Eva - she was a great character, but I just didn't think a woman would do some of the things she did to Lloyd and Jeff; as a psychologist, I really think Lloyd would have seen her coming and not got involved. The introduction in this novel of Henry - Jeff's best friend on the scene is a wise choice though, and it is his character, that proves to be the most tender and humanistic of all of them.<br />The mystery of Andrew, I kind of guessed towards the end of the story - but I still thought it was a clever way of intertwining this with the soap opera stories of the major characters. Mann seems to have the circuit scene pretty well covered, although I do think there are many gay men who enjoy going to parties occasionally, but don't make it a \\"life style\\" of sex and drugs as Mann suggests in this book.<br />There are some important issues about gay life raised - AIDS, loneliness, lack of communication, dangers of drugs etc., but I think the issues tend to be somewhat stifled by Mann's concentration on the circuit party scene. Where the Boys Are was a bit of a disappointment after reading the previous novel, as The Men from the Boys seemed to deal with much more serious issues. Where the Boys Are just exhausted me towards the endand I was glad it was over; I don't think I could have handled it if this book had been any longer. On the positive side though, the book really made we want to visit Boston and Provincetown sometime.<br />Michael	2003-07-26
US	30922103	R7LV3URUESPKK	038533673X	272124296	Easter Island	Books	3	10	15	N	N	good effort but falls flat	The idea of exploring simultaneous times frames is nothing new; it was done so beautifully in Heat and Dust, and more recently in A.S. Byatt's Possession, and of course in Cunningham's The Hours. So, there is nothing new in Vanderbes' Easter Island where two women from different generations are forced to undergo realization and change using the beautiful Easter Island as a backdrop. Of the two stories though, I thought Elsa's was the most convincing and heart rendering - her frustrations at being in a passionless marriage, her love for Max and her \\"difficult\\" relationship with her younger sister. Although I did enjoy Greer's story - the death of her husband, and his ultimate betrayal of her makes for a riveting and harrowing reading.<br />The evocations of Easter Island are indeed beautiful, and you really do get the sense of actually being on the Island, but, generally, the story seemed to get hijacked by too many subplots involving too many of the secondary characters from both stories. I also didn't buy the arrival of Elsa's mysterious visitor towards the end of the story; this was just too coincidental to be believed! I loved the way Vanderbes intertwined the diaries of the great explorers into this story, such as Cook, and La Perouse, and it was quite prophetic to think that after their exploration of Easter Island the would both go on across the Pacific to visit Australia. And the whole unraveling of the science of Easter Island being undertaken against the larger backdrop of World War 1 was also quite unique. The botanical and scientific descriptions of the flora and flora were generally well done, but I thought there tended to be a little too much of it; we didn't need to know all every single scientific name for every single plant. This is a good novel that starts out really well, but I thought it tended to get a little repetitive and monotonous towards the end. I got bored with the story.<br />Michael	2003-07-22
US	30922103	R3AO4GXBTJPHI5	0452278562	727681212	The Men from the Boys	Books	5	5	7	N	N	What a wonderful accomplishment!	I reread this novel after having a break from it for a few years, in preparation for the sequel, Where the Boys Are. I wanted to be reminded of the fabulous characters and the wonderful depictions of Boston and Provincetown, that Mann brings so irreverently to life. This is a great story - and presents a lot of issues that, at the time, were extremely important to the generation of gay men that missed the hedonistic post-stonewall days, yet grew up with the specter of AIDS hanging over their heads. Jeff's insecurities over his relationship with Lloyd; his issues with his family and friends; his AIDS paranoia; his struggle to deal with open relationships, and his searches for anonymous sex are all issues that many gay men were facing, and I think to an extent, still face today. <br />Mann's characterizations and his eye for dialogue are just spot on - he makes you believe that Jeff, Eduardo, Lloyd and Javitz are in the room with you, and the scenes of domestic drama between Lloyd and Jeff are played out beautifully and realistically. For about the first quarter of the book I was put off by the pretentiousness of the characters, but then I realized that this pretentiousness is exactly is what the author is trying to convey, and it didn't make me love the characters any less.<br />The themes in The Men from the Boys are universal and notable for how gay men across different generations live and love. And it is absolutely gorgeously written - the way Mann uses the natural beautify of Provincetown to create atmosphere is astounding. The novel is also very exact in its depiction of the passions in gay relationships and friendships. Mann is a really talented and accomplished writer, and I'm really looking forward to picking up Where the Boys Are and rejoining the lives of Jeff and Lloyd. I also hope we see a lot more of William J. Mann's work. The Triangle Classics Edition is also notable for a really good introduction by the author, which gives a sense of perspective to the story, and offers helpful background to the initial writing of the novel. The Men From the Boys is an absolutely essential and a wonderful read!<br />Michael	2003-07-18

I can appreciate the other reviewers' comments that work was effective, educational and finely nuanced, but for me the story just didn't work. I feel that Liss's style is far too simplistic to carry an epic, complex story of historical fiction, and for me his characters just lacked depth. In order for historical fiction to work effectively, you must not only place the characters firmly in the period, but you must also spend a lot of time \\"recreating\\" the period in an enormous amount of residual detail, in order to make us truly believe that we are really there. I never once got the feeling that I was actually in Amsterdam in 1659. While reading the Coffee Trader I kept thinking of the fabulous Jeannette Winterson novel \\"The Passion\\" - a work of astounding literary achievement, which was much more effective at firmly rooting you in a particular time period. <br />On the positive side, I did find the subject matter of the origin of coffee to the west somewhat interesting. And I also thought that the descriptions of the stock market and futures trading were very enlightening, but I certainly wasn't interested enough Miguel and his petty scheming to finish the story. I think this story would probably make a better film - with perhaps Colin Firth playing the role of Miguel. Just a thought!<br />Michael	2003-07-16
US	30922103	R7J80T5A0CI0J	0743235053	828625250	Haunted Ground: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A solid and atmospheric mystery	This story works on a variety of levels, and as a first novel, I thought it was extremely accomplished, not only as a mystery thriller, but also as a good, solid piece of literary fiction with a nice easy relaxed style that isn't too simplistic. I'm only giving the book four stars, however, because I guessed who the murderer was about three quarters of the way through, and I just felt that the story kind of petered out towards the end. I also didn't think that the love story between the main protagonists Nora and Cormac was convincing and well developed enough; it felt \\"tacked\\" onto the end of the story. The only other problem was I felt that the chapters were a little short, which had the unintentional effect of having the novel read more like a series of short vignettes.<br />Generally though, Haunted Ground has everything that one could want from an Agatha Christie novel or a PBS mystery  - a vast, impersonal manner house, with a spooky, dysfunctional and non-communicative family wondering around in it; an ancient priory; a fire in an abandoned tower; ancient and deserted underground passage ways, two unsolved murders, mysterious lights at night, and the angst ridden neighbour with a chip on his shoulder. Oh, and lets not forget, lots of overcast weather with rainy, stormy nights! <br />Hart's achievement with this book should be applauded - as she's managed not only to achieve the atmospheric mystery, but she's also managed to paint a vivid portrait of rural Ireland that is pretty genuine and also include a lot of Irish history. It's very interesting to read a novel set in a country like Ireland but written by an American. Hart's ties to the country and her love of the country are really exemplified in this work. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes reading about Ireland or likes stories that are set in Ireland, just don't take the outcome of the story too seriously, as I'm sure you'll guess pretty early on what happened to Mina Osborne and her son.<br />A good start for Hart, and even though this story does have its faults, I'll still look forward to reading more of her material.<br />Michael	2003-07-13

What a bleak, miserable and pessimistic future Atwood envisions. Scientifically complex and literally complex, Atwood is raising the all important question of \\"what if the scientific tools that we have today are misused, and how far down the road do we have to go before things start to go terribly wrong?\\" I'm a big fan of Atwood's work, but I have to say that this novel is not one of my favourites, although I DID read The Handmaid's Tale years ago and absolutely loved it. Those who say that Oryx and Crake is a science fiction novel are missing the mark; it's actually speculative fiction - taking a world that is familiar to us now and hypothesizing an incredible outcome. Atwood raised lots of issues in this book - genetics, and gene splicing, sexuality, popular culture, environmental destruction, the existence of god, STD's, diseases, globalization and the fate of human societies. This is not a \\"heavy\\" read but certainly a provocative one. I found the preamble with Snowman's encounter with the Crakers a little tedious, but the story really gets going when we start flashing back to Jimmy and Crake. I really liked the way Atwood keeps giving you hints throughout and keeps you wondering what actually happened to society, and how Snowman ends up in this situation. The scenes when Jimmy goes to work in the Compound are chilling in their realistic detail and it's the sort of story that gives you bad dreams at night!<br />This is a good read, but a very depressing vision of our future!<br />Michael	2003-06-22

I also enjoyed the movie starring Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Colin Firth. I haven't, however, \\"gotten into\\" any of her other novels since then, but I really liked Good Faith. What a lusty, sexy novel about money and seduction!<br />I think that a number of reviewers have been somewhat misguided in their review of this novel. Yes, it IS long and on first appearances appears to be convoluted, but it really is an amazing story of an era is capitalist American history. Also as a character study of different personalities and the lengths they go to for greed, this story is unsurpassed. Joe is an amazingly complex character: he has some bad moments, but he's basically a good businessman and a good person. I think it's his small town naivete that is his ultimate downfall.<br />Generally, Good Faith, is an excellent novel about greed, lust, and self-delusion set in the economic boom of the early 1980s,. Joe is an amiable, divorced real estate agent in an unspoiled small town called Rollins Hills. He takes it in stride when a married female friend pursues a love affair with him; he is more suspicious when a high-rolling newcomer named Marcus Burns begins to influence the business affairs of the men closest to Joe.  Marcus Burns is an archetypal, sociopathic personality - and the tension of this novel is really in the web he gradually weaves over Joe's life. You know his proposed real estate deal is doomed to failure, and you just want to shake and scream at Joe and his way of thinking. <br />Read this and stay with it; you'll be really pleased!<br />Michael	2003-06-17

Set in the 17th century, during the English civil war, As Meat Loves Salt follows the misadventures of Jacob, born a gentleman but raised a servant, whose overdeveloped sense of personal dignity leads him from one crisis to another. When the book opens, he is already a murderer. Within a hundred pages he becomes a rapist and a thief. All this is perfect training for a military career, and Jacob soon finds himself in Cromwell's New Model army and in thrall to a charismatic man named Ferris. The battle scenes were beautifully described as were the many realistic domestic scenes such as tooth pulling, but I just felt that the novel gets bogged down in its own self-importance.<br />I think this book is suited to those readers who have a real appreciation for 17th century literature, and readers who have an interest in English cultural history. In fact, I skimmed the last half of the novel, as I was getting impatient with the characters, and wanted to find out quickly what happened to Jacob. As an historical treatise on gay relationships, and a story of the cruel times, I think the novel worked quite well, but I would be hard pressed to recommend this as a \\"must read.\\" <br />Michael.	2003-06-11

This is a fabulous read, and a gorgeous, sexy, lusty and insightful story. A Ship Made of Paper is an important book, not just for its comments about race in modern day America, but also for its sly depiction of modern day love. I've never read any Scott Spencer before A Ship Made of Paper, but I can assure you that I was just \\"blown away\\" by this story. This story doesn't have any pretensions, but it can't help being an absolutely sensational melodrama. I thought the characterizations of all four characters - Iris, Daniel, Hampton, and Kate were spot on. He is such an honest writer in the way he exemplifies all their insecurities on sex, race, family, and infidelity. <br />Spencer shows that is affairs of the heart there are no easy answers, which is why I think the book ended as it did. Iris and Daniel just couldn't stop loving each other. But of course, the real irony of the story was the totally innocent relationship between the two children, Ruby and Nelson - one black, one white. This is a haunting and intelligent love story, that is sly, cynical and yet at the same time an incredibly astute character study of middle class American life. I also thought the story provided an interesting depiction of small town American life, and it was somewhat debunking the myth that \\"safety\\" lies in small towns. Of course, the title \\"A Ship Made of Paper\\" is totally symbolic of the fragility of human relationships, and how they can so easily be destroyed by the pursuit reckless romantic love. <br />Wickedly insightful and passionate - this is a must read.<br />Michael	2003-06-04

And I do hope that she writes other fiction, because I think she has a lot to offer. But I got bored with this story, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the plot was a little too sloppy, or the story iself just took too long to unfold. <br />Her descriptions of the 17th-century plague that is carried from London to a small Derbyshire village by an itinerant tailor are indeed horrific in their details. As villagers begin, one by one, to die, the rest face a choice: do they flee their village in hope of outrunning the plague or do they stay? The lord of the manor and his family pack up and leave. The rector, Michael Mompellion, argues forcefully that the villagers should stay put, isolate themselves from neighboring towns and villages, and prevent the contagion from spreading. All this is seen through the eyes of the liberal minded narrator Anna Frith, and what a complex character she is.<br />I can see why people loved this book, unfortunately, I didn't love it enough to give it a five star recommendation.<br />Michael	2003-05-30

I think it has something to do with Griesemer's style; it's as though he's trying too hard to be both an historical novel and a \\"romance.\\" I think this novel fails on all levels. Too much time is wasted on banal \\"soap opera\\" like encounters with the different characters, and there is something very odd about the way he uses metaphor and structures his sentences. <br />The idea of constructing a fictional novel around the first laying of the transatlantic telephone cable, and of the men and women caught in its monumental tide, is a good one. But I just felt that the characters that Griesemer creates are just stock \\"19th century\\" stereotypes - none of them really come alive as people. I think this kind of writing might me beyond this writer. If you really wish to read an epic 19th century sweeping saga interweaving real life events with fictional and real characters read Lauren Belfer's \\"City of Light\\" on the pan-American exposition in the city of Buffalo, New York - now that's an achievement!<br />Michael	2003-05-27
