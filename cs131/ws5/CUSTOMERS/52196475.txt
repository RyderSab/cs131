I recently completed William Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" and Lutzer's book is a necessary complement to that longer work because the author focuses specifically on the spiritual struggle that was covering Germany. As Scripture states, the real battle is not so much against flesh and blood as against satanic forces and the rule of evil in this world. Lutzer concentrates on this critical arena and brings to light some fascinating insights that many other authors ignore or gloss over. <br /> <br />Personally, the book hit home on a number of levels. By and large, the organized church in Germany pitifully cow towed to the Nazi regime, bowing the head while Hitler tried to destroy Christianity by wedding it to the satanically political force that was Nazism. It basically came down to power -- if Hitler could restore Germany to its former glory, the church, by and large, was willing to give up all that was sacred. That's a chilling reality when you look at modern day America. How many churches in Germany were silent while Jews and other enemies of the Third Reich were shipped off to concentration camps, yet how many churches here in America offer no protest when our national collectively murders 45 million unborn children? The same atrocity that engulfed the church in Germany is being faced by the church in America. Are we going to sit idly by in our prosperity while such a great injustice occurs? It's a probing question.  <br /> <br />I also found Lutzer's description of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's heroic stand against Nazism quite moving. Indeed, if a man gains the whole world and yet loses his soul, what good is it to him? Hitler is dead and gone now, thankfully in the power of an almighty God; Bonhoeffer is also gone, but he shall live eternally with his Lord. It's a glorious thought toknow that on the day of the Lord, I will embrace such a man as a brother, through the grace of Jesus Christ alone. <br /> <br />\\"Hitler's Cross\\" is definitely worth reading for both believers and non-believers. It sheds new light on the holocaust America is going through and really convicts one of the necessity to stand for truth, regardless of what lies the spirit of the age is propagating. The question is: Will we Christians in America have the commitment to our Lord to stand, as Bonhoeffer did, even when it might cost us everything? <br />	2005-08-31

In \\"The Problem of Pain\\" Lewis deciphers a very trying question for the whole of Christianity - why must humanity suffer. Many atheists argue that if God were both omnipotent and good, why does he allow such a world of pain to exist? Lewis answers this question and many others in a style that can easily be compared with a learned scholar, not a layman.<br />While I don't agree with all of Lewis's suppositions in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" (namely some of the statements found in the chapter \\"The Fall of Man\\" dealing with the origins of the human species), he still by and large offers up a very convincing case deeply rooted in the best Christian doctrine around  - The Bible. The problem of pain for the Christian may be summed up rather simply: 1) Man, not God, was and is the creator and instigator of pain through Adam's sin. 2) Pain is a megaphone God uses to speak to us - sharply perhaps, uncomfortably, even unbearably - but if pain did not exist, would the joy and peace of God's love be the same? God uses pain to rouse a deaf world, to let us all know that something is wrong, that we need something beyond ourselves. 3) While life can be exceedingly painful at times, there is always the happiness, the sunrises and the mountain streams, for us to enjoy. Pain allows us see joy even more clearly. As Lewis himself writes, \\"Our Father refreshed us on the journey with some pleasant Inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.\\" <br />An interesting and thought-provoking read from the 20th century's greatest Christian theologian, apologist, and \\"layman\\".	2003-03-10

Topics range from deep theological matters - such as prayer, Divine omnipotence, the three-personal God - to more applicable subjects like sexual morality, marriage, divorce, Scripture reading, etc. This is a superb compendium of Lewis' main arguments for many subjects pertaining to the Christian life. New Lewis readers will find \\"The Joyful Christian\\" very interesting and delightful, especially since the book is organized according to subject. If you're looking for a Lewis quote on a particular subject, this is an excellent resource. Great for new readers and old timers alike.	2003-01-16

I really appreciated Jordan's writing style in this book. Given, he does repeat himself more than once, often utilizing certain cliched phrases that become tiresome, but overall his writing should be admired. He gives more than enough attention to detail, and his dialogue has some \\"pop\\" to it, giving the reader the impression that the characters are real people who will always react to given situations in different ways. The main character, Rand, is especially developed in this book. His character has some depth, and I look forward to seeing how Jordan uses him in the next book. The plot line of \\"The Great Hunt\\" is straightforward and rarely wanders, unlike its predecessor \\"The Eye of the World\\". That being said, however, I must admit that it's not *that* difficult to have a straight flowing plot when the characters are doing nothing but seeking something, in this case the Horn. The story pretty much flows itself along without much outside help. Jordan does a good job of touching the reader's emotions in several chapters - I found myself really caring about what the good guys cared about. That kind of writing cannot be learned. It's a gift. <br />Now to the bad. Again, as with \\"The Eye of the World\\", the story is too long and drawn out. The good writing compensates for some of this, but still, the story could have easily been told in 300-350 hardback sized pages. Instead of making it short and sweet, Jordan drags it out for nearly 600 pages, not including the tedious appendix. Also, I found the character of Selene to be a very much on the annoying side. I'm guessing Jordan will bring her back in the next book as he did at the end of \\"The Great Hunt\\", but still, she served hardly any purpose other than to harass three of the main characters. It was tiresome at first, then grew sickening. I was also disgusted by some of Jordan's sexual undertones. I got the feeling that it was put there simply for shock value. If not, I doubt Robert Jordan can normallyrelate to the opposite sex, and I feel sorry for him.<br />If you're just picking up the books, please don't expect another \\"Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series doesn't even come close. However, it does have some unique moments to offer. If you're a fantasy fan, and don't mind spending hours and hours and hours only to realize that you've only advanced 30 pages, then \\"The Great Hunt\\" and the entire \\"Wheel of Time\\" series is definitely for you. Four our of five states.	2002-05-01

Out of all of the six Bellairs/Strickland books published thus far, \\"The Hand of the Necromancer\\" still remains the best. Even though Brad Strickland was bold to say the least with this one, he managed to pull off an excellent story line and introduce a new character to boot while still including all of the original Bellairs magic and charm.<br />The dust jacket design by Edward Gorey is one of the best - the hand and globe on the front immediately tell an important part of the story without even having to open the book, and the illustration on the back of Johnny, the Professor and Sarah at the park with Mattheus Mergal in the background brandishing his staff is marvelously done. We will sourly miss you, Mr. Gorey!<br />If you decide to read any of the Bellairs/Strickland books, make this one the first title you pick up. It'll set a good mood for the next five.

While definitely not as good as some of Strickland's past attempts (most notably the books he completed such as &quot;The Ghost in the Mirror&quot;, or even his own &quot;The Hand of the Necromancer&quot;), it's still a fun read for Bellairs fans. For those of you who liked the immensely popular &quot;House With a Clock in its Walls&quot; (and who didn't?), you'll be happy to know that this adventure is a sort of sequel with a mysterious, though rather one dimensional villain with a very familiar name. Lewis Barnavelt is back along with Uncle Jonathan and all their friends.<br />The new dust jacket illustration and frontispiece within are marvelous, catching the essence of the late Edward Gorey's style very well. But the publishers needs to let S. D. Schindler do the entire dust wrapper, not just the front! One of the special aspects of the original Bellairs novels were the illustrations - you've got an artist who can do them almost as good as Edward Gorey, so please let him do the entire jacket!<br />I have one small gripe. While &quot;The Tower at the End of the World&quot; is a lot of fun, Brad Strickland seems to be sticking to the same old formula a little too much. This is unfortunate. The past three or four stories have all been basically the same, only in different locales and with different characters. That's why I believe &quot;The Hand of the Necromancer&quot; is one of Strickland's best since he used some original ideas and even was bold enough to introduce a new character. Even though many of John Bellairs's novels were similar, they were never totally similar, if you know what I mean; they each had original elements that made them interesting and unique to read. Brad Strickland needs to incorporate some totally unique elements himself. And a note to Dial: we need more 160 to 170 pagers, not 145!<br />Overall, though,well worth a read!	2001-11-18

Compared to many other authors who have tred to emulate a famous author after his death (such as Christopher Tolkien or Brian Herbert), Brad Strickland does a phenomenal job. He was a perfect choice to take over the Bellairs legacy when the timeless author bit the dust in 1991. &quot;The Beast Under the Wizard's Bridge&quot; is a good Stricland effort, although not my favorite by Strickland. The book unfortunately suffers from over editing, cutting the size down to a pitiful 150 pages (although not quite as pitiful as &quot;The Secret of the Underground Room&quot; which was only around 120!) The shortness of the book gives the ending a &quot;hurried&quot; feeling which detracts from what would otherwise have been a great ending. Otherwise, the book is definitely one for Bellairs fans to read.<br />Thanks, Mr. Strickland, and keep up the good work with next year's &quot;The Tower at the End of the World&quot;!	2000-12-11

Yes, here is yet another poor student who was forced to read this and similar writings on the Puritans! To my pleasant surprise, however, I found &quot;The Crucible&quot; to be better than I had first expected - this probably has to do partly with the fact that the story is rather short, but also with the fact that the story is rather interesting as well. Written in the form of a play by the thought-to-be-communist Arthur Millar, &quot;The Crucible&quot; can really bring you into the story if you let it. The main subject behind this book is the hypocrisy of the Puritan civilization, dealing mainly with the witch trials and burnings in Salem during the late 17th century in early America. The story is crafted around actual fact and history texts, but some of the characters and scenes Miller describes are fictitious, naturally. Even though the fiction element is strong, the book also carries a level of realism to it that takes you back to those horrible times in 1692 quite well.<br />While I don't really like the reasons Miller wrote the book (to somehow prove he was innocent of ties with communists....what does that mean?), the book was still interesting and provocative. Students out there, stick with it - the book isn't that bad, it's short, to the point, and actually can have your complete attention at times.	2000-11-13

I beat &quot;Half Life&quot; before even opening this book, but I still found it to contain plenty of useful information and tips even for the experienced gamer. If you're getting this book for the walkthrough only, then you'd probably be better off not purchasing it. You can find many detailed walkthroughs online (albeit not quite as detailed as the one found here, but still detailed enough to understand.) On the other hand, if you want to pick up a few new tricks to beat enemies, or load yourself with information on the weapons, beasts, levels, and tactics than this book is definitely for you. The walkthrough itself was very good, although, as I said before, not worth the price of the book. It includes clear pictures and precise details about where to go, what to shot, what to do, and how to do it. Other sections include information on all items you can pick up, and all enemies you will face. There is also a &quot;tips and tricks&quot; section of the book for the game, explaining various tactics that are useful for different situations. Near the back of the book, as well, there is a chapter dedicated to tactics for multiplayer games. Even though I haven't tried playing online or over a network yet, the advice seemed to be quite sound and reasonable.<br />I enjoyed the book immensely, and it's a definite must for any serious &quot;Half-Life&quot; player.	2000-11-13

I'm surethey realize going up against Frank Herbert's DUNE is a very difficulttask, but they still tried. For that, at the very least, we must givethem credit.  Unfortunately, while I do respect the authors for theirattempt, these books come no where near the level of complexity of theoriginal DUNE. For one thing, the writing style is completelydifferent. The constant use of certain adjectives really gets oldafter a while, as does the incessant use of particular words that theauthor's repeat and repeat and repeat.<br />The writing aside, the bookdoesn't really tell much. It's not a story, really, more like ahistory book. If Frank Herbert had written &quot;House Atreides&quot;before the original DUNE, it would have fallen into the pile of crappysci-fi books that occupy much of the literary market nowadays.  Youreally have to have read DUNE to understand what's going on in thesequels, so newbies to the DUNE books should steer clear of these forright now.<br />As far as this book goes, &quot;House Harkonnen&quot;,I'd put it on an equal level with &quot;House Atreides&quot;. I mustsay it's interesting to read all the history behind DUNE, how the maincharacters grew up and &quot;matured&quot; (although some of themnever really mature, even after their adults.) It's good to see thefat Baron again, and an adult Leto Atreides. Halleck is alsointroduced in this book, the famous swordsman who will later trainPaul Atreides in DUNE. Unfortunately, Duncan Idaho, one of my favoritecharacters, is left completely out of this one, except for a brief(and I mean brief) appearance at the beginning of the book. It's toobad, since his story was one of the more interesting of those followedby &quot;House Atreides&quot;.<br />If you're a die hard DUNE fan, buythe book.  You're going to anyway, no matter what I say. Be warned,though, and don't expect to experience DUNE all over again. It doesn'teven come close, unfortunately.	2000-10-20

However, unlike many reviewers here, I have a  much different view of the story. As some people have said before,  Hawthorne's book takes a good deal of concentration, effort, and strength  to understand. Not only to understand, but to finish. The story can drag  sometimes, it is true, and Hawthorne's style of writing occasionally leaves  something to be desired (I don't think I've ever seen that many commas, 15  letter words, or page long paragraphs before), but we simply must look past  these minor issues. Overall, the plot is highly creative and intense,  despite the writing.\<br />Ok, ok, I agree that the first chapter, &quot;The  Custom-House&quot;, was pretty bad. In fact, it was so bad and boring that  I drifted off to sleep several times while reading it! The first chapter  has little relevancy with the story, so, unless you have to, I would  suggest skipping that part of the text. The rest is exceptionally good, and  the quality of the plot cannot be overlooked. My advice is to just lay off  the first chapter; that way you'll be able to enjoy the rest of the book  without difficulty.<br />The story itself deals with sin and adultery, a  subject that isn't very popular right now. Hawthorne does an excellent job  of telling us about this, but he leaves the reader with many questions  floating around in his mind at the conclusion. At the end of the story  you're not 100% sure if Hawthorne was condemning the Puritan society, or if  he was commending it. He leaves that for the reader to figure out, which is  a thing authors seldom do. That's a major reason I believe this work is so  unique and timeless.<br />The story involves a women named Hester Prynne,  living in the New World in the late 17th century. She has committed  adultery with someone unknown, and, since the Puritan society considered  the Bible to be their ultimate source of law, the punishment wasquite  severe for such an act. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet &quot;A&quot;  (for adultery) on her attire at all times, as a sign to everyone that she  has sinned deeply. And so she must carry out the rest of her life this way.  That's the major gist of the plot, although there's much more. I won't give  it anyway, though, you'll have to read the book to find out.<br />Let's face  it: at some time or another we all are going to probably  have to read this  book, voluntarily or involuntarily. Shouldn't we try to make the best of  it? Read it for its enjoyment, anything else would be missing the point.	2000-09-06

Needless to say, while the  story is put forth much the same way as Lewis's space trilogy, it does  carry a large amount of theological speculations on heaven and hell. I  believe the best way for an author to communicate his feelings with the  reader is this way, by presenting a fictitious reality and injected into  that reality the truths of our own reality. In this respect C.S. Lewis has  certainly hit a home run.<br />The story involves a man, presumably and  through my thought Lewis himself, traveling on a bus ride into heaven.  While there, he experiences events beyond human comprehension, coming  across many instances of people rejecting the grace and goodwill of God,  and instead choosing to live their live down below in the town which the  narrator first departed in the bus from. Obviously, this town is hell.  Milton was indeed right with his statement from Lucifer just before he was  throw into the pit, &quot;It is better to rule in hell than serve in  heaven&quot;. This is the ideology of many of Lewis's characters in this  book.<br />While in the wonderful land, the narrator meets with George  Macdonald (a hero of Lewis's throughout his life, both before his  conversion and after.) McDonald takes the narrator on many trips around the  land, witnessing discussions between humans and angels.<br />Every writer has  at least one great work: C.S. Lewis was blessed with the ability to produce  many. &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is perhaps one of his most insightful  works of fantasy/fact ever conceived. It reminded me very much of the book  of Revelation, in which the Apostle John records his experiences on a  deserted island. By the end of Lewis's tale, we find out that the whole  thing had been a dream injected into his mind by God. We finish the tale  with the promise of the narrator to George McDonalds to tell no one of his  events. Classic Lewis style.<br />This is a definite read for Lewis scholars  and fans alike, and is suredly one of C.S.L.'s finest pieces of literature.	2000-08-08

Lewis. The author doesn't take  time to stray from the general layout of Lewis's life, and there are very  few obscure &quot;facts&quot; in this book. However, it is singular in that  it keeps you interested, moving the story of Lewis along at a good clip.  Fans will probably enjoy this one the most, while scholar's of Lewis might  be put off by the size and lack of in depth information.<br />One of the  aspects I especially liked about this book was the concentration on Lewis'  Christian beliefs, and how they effected his literature. Some other  biographies seem to lack this very important side.<br />If you're looking for  a very thorough and meticulous biography, you should probably stay away  from this one. Coren simply outlines the major events in Lewis' life,  without straying from the general purpose: to reflect on the life of the  20th century's greatest Christian Apologist.<br />I found it most interest,  and, even though I believe I'm an up and coming Lewis scholar, still feel  it was captivating and fairly in depth.

Lewis. It is the first title to  stray from the progressing story, and the first to begin with characters  already living in Narnia, or thereabouts at least. The 5th original, before  the publisher resembled the series, it remains my favorite to this  day.<br />The story is of a boy's flight with a horse across the dangerous  lands north of Narnia, taking him through the city of Tashbaan, one of the  marvels of the world, through a bleak desert, through Archenland which is  on the very southern tip of Narnia, and finally into the land we all know  and love so well. While it is quite different from it's predecessors, it's  still refreshing to know that Lewis could diversify with little  difficulty.<br />This IS the best story of the original seven, and shouldn't  be slipped. Lewis' imagination shines forth brilliantly throughout the  tale; it's the kind of imagination you would expect from a child, which is  perhaps why the Narnia books are so warmly welcomed into many walks of  life. The book also contains some of my favorite Aslan quotes, and is worth  the read just for those if not anything else.<br />A definite classic in my  book!	2000-08-01

If you're interested in the history and lives of famous 20th century authors, this book is definitely for you. &quot;The Inklings&quot; is a delightful peek into the world of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, retelling the  lives of several great authors. Among these are C.S. Lewis, author of the  Chronicles of Narnia series; J.R.R. Tolkien, author of &quot;The Lord of  the Rings&quot;; Charles Williams, a somewhat less noticed author now a  days; and many others.<br />The group consisted of a rather small membership,  but the ideas and input that the men gave to each other in regards to their  writing probably turned out to be invaluable by the time their works were  ready for publication. It was to the Inklings that Lewis first read his  &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and Tolkien his &quot;Lord  of the Rings&quot; which the group simply called &quot;The Hobbit  Book&quot;.<br />This has been the best biography I've found on this group of  writers, and indeed carries more detail about C.S. Lewis than many  biographies dedicated solely to him have. The same is true with Tolkien and  Williams. Even if you're simply a curious fan, wanting to know a little bit  more about the men who created some of the 20th century's finest  literature, this book still delivers.	2000-07-30

I read through the entire Narnia series a long time ago, with the exception of &quot;The Last Battle&quot; - I now see I was missing a large part of the story.<br />Where do I begin? The book goes beyond comprehension,  and brings a new light to allegorical fantasy. I think it especially good  that C.S. Lewis injected allegory into children's literature, a thing that  seems seldom done these days. This story is a delightful layout of the Book  of Revelation in Narnian terms, with the final battle (meaning the end of  Narnia as we have known it), and the renewal and creation of a brand new  world, without pain or suffering: the heaven of Narnia.<br />No family or home  should be without these great books. While their influence is obviously  Christian, secular sections of society can also enjoy them since the author  never talks about God or Christ directly, but uses imaginary creatures and  words to replicate them into the world he created. With wonderful pros C.S.  Lewis has communicated his feelings perfectly to the reader, both Christian  and non.<br />Overall I would definitely rate &quot;The Last Battle&quot; as  one of the best in the Narnia series. It still amazes me that these books  are 50 years old and so timeless - here, here to C.S. Lewis!	2000-07-30

I'm sorry to say, however, that I can't. I'm a very fervent C.S. Lewis fan. He has always been one of my heroes and  role models, and his life is just as, if not more interesting than the  amazing man's literature. I've read several biographies on Lewis, and plan  to read many more in the future, all of which, I'm sure, will be better  than &quot;Lenten Lands&quot;.<br />I've corresponded with Doug Gresham some,  so you can image how I feel giving this book only three stars. Here are my  reasons: the book has very little to do with Lewis himself, or even his  marriage with Joy Gresham. This book concentrates nearly %70 on Doug  Gresham's life. It started to get really old, and by the time Lewis passed  away about half way through the book I simply couldn't take any more. No  offence, Mr. Gresham, but I'm not too interested in how many girls you had  crushes on during your youth. He describes lying on a sofa with one,  holding each other tight, during his teen years. And yet he contends that  he didn't have a sexual relationship? I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound  like a very Christian attitude to me. I thought this was a biography of the  famous Christian apologist and author C.S. Lewis, but obviously I was  wrong.<br />I only gave this book three stars because of respect to Mr. Lewis.  It is a book that claims to be about him and his life with Joy Gresham, and  for that I must at least concede a little. There are numerous other  biographies written by close friends of Jack, such as Walter Hooper's  &quot;The Inklings&quot;, or Sayer's &quot;Jack&quot;. If you want much  more in depth information, without a lot of side stories and useless facts  about Mr. Gresham's life, then please check out one of the other great  biographies. All I can say is I'm regretful about this book. It could have  been very good.	2000-05-05

Even though they've read Josh's book, I don't think they understand it very well. In a real sense, courtship  doesn't restrict teenagers from relationships, it fo fills them. I'm sorry,  but it's more than apparent from our huge divorce rate in this country that  dating isn't working. But wait, you might say, dating will work if Christ  is at the center of your relationship. Personally, I don't feel that  getting into a tempting situation like what happens many times on dates is  serving God. We're teenagers, which means we make plenty of mistakes. Even  if we feel that we're grounded on the word of God, that doesn't mean that  we won't and don't give in to temptation.<br />I think all of us should have a  more open mind, and take a good look at ourselves. I know it's hard to  admit that we've made mistakes, but if you love God you should want to  please him, and thus admitting that you're anything but perfect is much  easier. Almost every Christian teenager I know dates, and, unfortunately, a  very high number of them have had sex. Why do you think that the pregnancy  rate in church's is so high? Is it because we're following God's word? I  don't think so.<br />In closing I would like to say that I believe teens  should be concentrating on God during their adolescents. Afterall, the  teenage years are when Satin truly begins to try and fight against you with  all of the temptations of the world. Don't you think we should be closer  than ever to God then. The Bible says, &quot;&quot;But they who wait for  the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings like  eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not  faint.&quot; -- Isaiah 40: 13  That about sums it up. Wait, and God will  bless you. Mark my words.	2000-03-29

Having a story that is as well rounded and deeply plotted as this, especially when we're talking about a children's story, is a feat indeed. In this respect, and in many others, C.S. Lewis as done a remarkably  excellent job. The Christian morals and principles that it teaches are an  excellent addition to the story, and reflect greatly off of the man who  wove this story into being. Aside from being very good literature, children  should also read it for the lessons that it teaches. Perseverance in the  face of fear, trust in God, and love for those around you.<br />Sadly, as so  many have pointed out, few children get to experience the emotional  vividness, and compelling plot line of this fairytale now a days. In  addition to &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, there are six  other books in the &quot;Tales of Narnia&quot; series. My advice to parents  is to read all of these to your children, or, if your kids are old enough,  have them read them on their own. Everybody should read the series at least  one time, and if you haven't, your missing a great piece of American  literature.<br />It's still amazing to me that all of these thoughts and  concepts came from one man's head, and that through the God given gift of  words, C.S. Lewis changed the lives of millions.	2000-02-04

I must admit that some parts of this book were very good, especially in the suspense department.

When I was a child, I remember watching the cartoon version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and loving every second of it. I was suprised at how well the story was rounded, even though it had been translated into a cartoon. I had  no idea, however, that the real magic of the story is told in the pages of  Tolkien's masterpiece. When it was first published in 1937, the publisher  and Tolkien had no idea that it would blossom and grow as it has (few  authors think that their books will do as well as Tolkien's, and can only  hope for the high mark which Mr. Tolkien has achieved.) Now, 62 years  later, we find that it is perhaps THE most beloved book of the  century.<br />The well rounded plot and interesting, dynamic characters make  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; the finist book in it's genre. Many other authors  have tried to emulate Tolkien's masterful performance, but have all fallen  utterly short of the high mark which Tolkien sites at. In my book, J.R.R.  Tolkien will be one of the greatest authors in fantasy, and his wonderful  and enchanting works will never lose their literary quality or magic.	2000-01-01

The only reason I gave this book three stars was because, aside from some very major plot flaws, the story was pretty good. In some ways it was like reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" again, although \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series feels like it's written for pre-schoolers and not more mature readers like that of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". So, off the record, I did enjoy the 10  hours that it took me to get through this book. However, it was a challenge  in and of itself just to make it through the 700-page monster.<br />First off,  I personally feel that Jordan's success is due to Tolkien's works.  Anyone with any ounce of talent in writing could write this story with no  problem. Just what I said, Jordan is making fast money off of Tolkien's  superb talents.<br />The second is, why is everything so dang REPETITIVE!   I mean, if I hear the phrases \\"Light!\\", \\"Light help us!\\",  \\"Burn me!\\", \\"Blood and ashes!\\", or \\"Bloody!\\" Again, I think I'm going to  die! Another point is why does Jordan think it necessary to make his main  characters look like idiots? Whenever Rand, Mat, or Perrin go into an inn  and a serving maid smiles and giggles at them (which happens at about EVERY  place they stop), and one of those three says \\"Light! I wish Mat were here  with me! He knows how to talk with girls so much better than I do!\\", I'm  pitchin' this book into a blazing fire! <br />I'm sorry, but the plot is  filled with holes. Jordan introduces characters, and then immediately  throws them out the window. Is he trying to fill up paper space by doing this?  By the time the book is drawing to an end, I don't even think Jordan knew  what he was talking about.<br />I've heard that many people say \\"The Wheel  of Time\\" series is better than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because it has  female characters. This would be true, if Jordan didn't MAKE his female  characters act like idiots. All of them treat the men like\\"lower beings\\".  I guess Jordan wanted to make his \\"politically correct\\" statement in hisfantasy as well as trying to make a fast buck.<br />Basically, this story could  have been told in half the pages with no problem. It's obvious that Jordan  barrows from Tolkien, Herbert, and many other giants of the 20th century just  so that he can make money fast. However, the series hasn't become a best  seller for nothing, so do buy the book, site down, and TRY to enjoy it despite  all of the flaws in it. I myself am off to buy \\"The Great Hunt\\", although  that book will probably be just one long chase scene just like this book was. <br />Better authors include: J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Frank Herbert.	1999-12-18

Read the title of this essay and you've completed the whole book without having to go through the 900 pages the book consists of. Basically, this book is a long construction of different terrorist operations being  disrupted by a secret anti-terrorism society named  &quot;Rainbow&quot;.<br />The plot of the book is very weak, and is barley  held together by the somewhat intense and exciting segments when team one  or two of Rainbow is storming terrorist operations and blasting everyone's  guts everywhere, including some hostages. When I first looked down at this  900 page monster, I thought &quot;How the heck can Clancy turn the subject  of an anti-terrorism team into 900 pages?&quot;, it's obvious to me now  that he can't.<br />Another thing that is simply horrible about this book is  that it's written so poorly. You could tell that Clancy only wrote the book  for a computer game and maybe a future movie. The only thing I like about  this book is the computer game that was made out if it. Other than that,  this book is void of any good literature and a waste of money and time. Do  yourself a favor and read something else.	1999-11-22

I never went in for the original books that much, and am currently stuck near the end of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; hopping to get through with it soon so  that I can go onto the third book which I hear is much better than the  second. Anyway, this book stands out and away from the other books in the  &quot;Dune&quot; series. I think that Frank Herbert should have written  something like this before he published the original &quot;Dune&quot; since  it helped me out a great deal to understand the original books. It is much  more interesting and exciting than the original ones, and I'd recommend it  to any first time reader.	1999-11-19

There were a few things that I had a problem, but other than those one or two things the story was great. First I'll list the things I had a problem with:<br />1) I  think that the character development could've been a lot better in the  story. Especially with Dennis Nedry. I couldn't really tell much about him  from the way Crichton described him.<br />2) I didn't appreciate a lot of the  excessive coursing that appeared in this book. Namely taking God's name in  vain so many times.<br />Apart from the above rants, I really enjoyed the  book! I finished it in a couple of days since it's such a cliff hanger  novel, and will keep you reading so make sure you don't have anything  planed for the next couple of nights when you start it! It was also  interesting because it was so different from the movie, which is one of my  all time favorites. The characters are described much more differently in  the book, and I have to say that I probably like the way the characters are  described in the movie better than the book. It's rather a shock if you've  seen the movie first and then read the book because it's so different. I'm  glad they didn't kill off Muldoon because, at least in the movie, he was  the best character, followed closely to Grant. All in all one of the best  books I've ever read, and I'm off to buy the sequel, although I've heard it  isn't as good, &quot;The Lost World&quot;!	1999-09-08

The story is good, and pretty well written, but it has it's moments of completely and inexcusably boring &amp; or stupid parts. I find that some  of the descriptions are a little on the tedious side, but maybe that's just  because I'm pretty young. I might learn to appreciate the depth of it, as I  grow older. I find that descriptions in &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;  series are much more interesting then the ones Herbert writes. I also found  it disturbing that the book went into so much detail of the Fremen life and  religion. I know that this might be interesting for some people, but for me  it was down right boring and not needed! And again, like with most long  novels, the author could have told the story in half the pages! With all of  the above rants, I must say that I did enjoy reading this book, but I  really don't understand how it has such a strong following. Probably the  best character development was with the Harkonnen's which are the evil  guys. The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was a very interesting character, as was  his nephew the co-baron Feyd-Rautha. The best parts of the book are the  first 200 pages, and then it starts to go down hill from there until the  climatic last battle, which was superb! I can't give this book a full five  stars because it was not the best I have read. I would, however, recommend  it for people, but I'd even more recommend books by such authors as  Tolkien, and Jordan. The ending of &quot;Dune&quot; was a bit of a cliff  hanger, so I'm going to be going to read the next book in the series  &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; hoping that the series will get even better as I  go along. Enjoy the book!	1999-08-10

A new character was introduced in this title,  which might have been a little ambitious on the part of Brad Strickland  since it was the first true Bellairs book that he wrote. I think that if he  had waited a few more years, once people started to get used to the idea of  him writing the books, then he could introduce the new character. It's  great that Strickland has continued the Bellairs series like this, and I  can't wait for the next title in the series!	1999-07-30
