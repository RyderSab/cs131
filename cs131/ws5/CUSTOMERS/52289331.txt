Ooh, ooh, I know!  It is a wonderful book with believable characters and a beautiful setting!  That's why!  We meet Georgie surfing the net at 4 am; she does not even try to hide from her husband (who is a lobsterman and arises every morning at 4 for work) that she has spent another sleepless night drinking in front of the computer.  Jim does not bother to ask Georgie why she does this every night and the stage is set: a loveless, amicable marriage with the wife searching for her future and the husband hiding from his past.  Add another man attempting to eke out a living after a horrible loss (he explains the odd title for us) and sit back and enjoy the ride.  Western Australia comes to life with Winton's beautiful prose, and I spent a sleepless night reading on my couch to discover what happened to these three lost souls at the end of this gripping novel.  I look forward to reading other works by Mr. Winton!	2002-07-23

I got pulled into this book by Dubus' amazing ability to create tension.  Tom Wolfe did the same in A Man In Full.  These people are walking on the very edge of life, and I just had to see how it ended.  I kept thinking to myself, \\"This is what happens when people rely on THINGS for salvation.\\"  It made me wonder what I would do in this situation.  The tension was palpable, and it was a very enjoyable read.  Great for vacations or long trips by plane, car, or boat.	2002-03-06

That was the most interesting section of the book, when Una goes on board a whaling ship, and they are sunk by a BLACK whale (Una works in the Crow's Nest and actually sees Moby Dick before she even meets Ahab).  Silliness.<BR>I will say it has one of the best first lines ever: Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.  Good line.  Too bad the rest wasn't as engaging!  Too many characters with too little characterization.  And what's with that eagle at the lighthouse?  I didn't believe that scene at all, and I should have stopped right there.  It's a feminist treatise with some nice writing in between. The end made me want to gag.  <BR>All in all it made me want to read \\"Moby Dick\\".  Nice illustrations.

Writers can be so mean and petty toward each other!  That's the impression we get from this dark look at writing and the writing lifestyle, and I loved every page of it.  Blacker puts in these lists of famous writers and their quirks (what they did to unblock themselves; quips about their art) that would make a good book on their own (I guess he is working on one that will be out soon).  This book is unlike anything I have ever read: Keays seems so honest and trustworthy as first person narrator, but he turns out to be pond scum.  And what a surprise ending! It's one of those books where you finish it and start right back at the beginning to see if there was any inkling early on that it would end the way that it did.  There isn't, I checked.

The prose flowed (it's an amazing translation), the characters were beautiful, the setting was austere; I loved everything about this book.  For those who don't like the ending: it's not an American novel.  It's more French, so get over it.  I had never read anything set during the Cultural Revolution, and I found it fascinating.  I wonder if the author went to France because he read so many illicit French novels, or was it just coincidence?  I teach World Literature, and I can't wait for my students to read it.  They take their education for granted, and this novel will show them that there are places in the world where an unimpeded education is illegal. I highly recommend this book!	2001-11-18

You have to have a balance control on your tape player, or no dice.  I don't have a balance control, so I had to unplug first the left and then the right speaker to listen to this.  That's the only way they could get the entire novel onto four tapes!  Mr. Hill reads a lot slower than I do, for effect I guess, so we won't listen to this much.

This book is supposed to be told in three distinct voices: young Antoinetta, Rochester, and Crazy Antoinetta stuck in the attic. But the narration jumps about and it isn't told in three distinct voices: Antoinetta is in Rochester's section, and the voices are so similar that it is impossible to tell who is speaking. And it is very contrived because you know (or at least those of us who read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;) how it is going to end. It's much ado about something we already know about. I gave it two stars because Rhys can really capture a setting, and the scene that foreshadows the fire at the end of Jane Eyre was wonderfully written. It's an easy read, so if you loved Jane Eyre and want some more of it, go ahead and read it. Just don't expect to be as moved as you were by Bronte.	2001-08-25

We talked about this book for almost two solid hours, with no digressions. Our book club is known for its digressions when the book cannot hold our attention. Some of us liked it, some of us didn't, and the discussion was on! The general consensus was that we were glad we read it, and it was an interesting premise, and then opinions diverged. Read it and decide for yourself what you think about it. I myself really enjoyed it because it was vivid, imaginative, and educational (to a point: some characters do not coincide with their New Testament counterparts). Educational regarding The Goddess, whose worship I know nothing about. If you are in a book club, read it. If you are intrigued by the premise (the Passion of Christ from the eyes of Mary Magdelene, the high priestess in the service of The Goddess), give it 50 pages and decide whether or not to continue. I couldn't give it more than three stars because opinions widely diverged on this book in my book club, so I settled on three, which was the average of all 12 women in the club. It's an interesting read!	2001-08-25

Reading this novel has given me a glimpse into the lives of people living in a struggling democracy, and I think that is the genius of the novel.  Yes, it is depressing and you feel like crying; yes, you retch at the descriptions of living in extreme poverty; but why these visceral reactions?  Because it is extremely well written and you feel like you are right there struggling alongside these beautiful characters.  I couldn't wait for my day to end so I could jump back into the book and see how MY Dina Aunty, MY tailors, and MY boarder were faring.  Mistry wrote these characters so well that I absorbed them into my heart and I shared their hope and despair.<br />I think he set it in an unnamed city so that we wouldn't say to ourselves, &quot;Oh, this isn't real, this only happened in Bombay.&quot;  Mistry's point is that this can happen anywhere where there is extreme poverty and a corrupt government.  So choose your own third world country, find four people, and you might come up with something like this.  I was incredibly moved by this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see how difficult it can be to keep the fine balance between hope and despair when you are not a member of the First World.	2001-08-14

A sociologist arrives to research rural life and turns the little town upside down, starting with the weekly newspaper and its owner.  It is basically a comedy so things end up better than when they started; but there isn't a lot of meat on this bone.  Too much local color dialect is thrown in for show, and that takes away from the story.  If I had been his editor I would have encouraged him to trim this 300 page book way, way, way down to a longish short story.  It is full of quirky characters and is a fun read.  The best of the characters (and the reason why this book gets 3 stars from me) is the town's garbage collector, Rory Napoleon.  He falls off the wagon in a big way and it is incredibly funny.  I took this book with me on vacation and I would recommend it to others who are going away and want a light read.	2001-07-08

She knew how to keep her readers hooked, and she also knew when to stop with the cliffhangers and tell a bit more so we wouldn't get frustrated with this incredible tale of a horse, his two jockeys, his trainer and his owner.  Each of these characters gets his own chapter, and the way they come together is magic.  And what research!  The appendix at the end is amazing--like a textbook.  Too bad more history texts aren't written this way.  Students would love history if they were!<br />As amazing as Seabiscuit was, I thought this was really a story about the jockeys who rode him.  Red and Iceman went through horrible ordeals to attain their successes; ordeals I had no idea went on back then.  Thank goodness things have changed!  Or have they?  Today I learned that four horses had to be destroyed at the opening day of Emerald Downs in Auburn, WA.  They didn't say what happened to the jockeys.<br />I heard a story on this book on NPR before I read it, and I turned it off because I didn't want to know what happened.  Even if you did hear that story, read this book.  It's got it all: heroes, heartbreak, and history!  Hillenbrand wrote a gem.	2001-04-25

So for them, I bet it is great.  But right now I am a stay at home Mom, so coming up with a Mission Statement is not high on my priority list.  But I really enjoyed the stories about Winston Churchill and Mother Theresa, so I gave the book one star per person.  This book would be a great starting point to help you figure out what is most important to you if you haven't done anything like that before with your life.  On a skiing scale, it would be for novices.  I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately, so I'm an intermediate and I didn't get much out of it.  One book that I did enjoy was Dr. Phil McGraw's Life Strategies.  It's a quick read because he writes in terms everyone can understand, and it gave me a lot to think about.	2001-04-24

The section on classroom management was wonderful and I will use some of his ideas, but other ideas like shaking every students' hand at the door I will take a pass.

Living in Seattle I had always heard of Tom Robbins, but I never read him.  That all changed one fateful day in 1989 while I was meandering the fiction stacks at the downtown public library.  &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; was the only Robbins book on the shelf.  I look back on that week of reading my first Robbbins novel with fondness.<br />It starts in the present day, then flashes back to medieval Europe and King Alobar.  Alobar discovers the secret to everlasting life, and we follow him and his wife Kudra on their many adventures.  They meet Pan in Arcadia and take him with them to Paris where the flashback ends and we are in the 20th century looking for the recipe of Kudra's perfume.  Trust me, the plot is entertaining, and reading Robbins' prose is a pleasure.<br />I have read all of them and my number two choice of his is &quot;Skinny Legs and All&quot;.  I loved Can O Beans and Spoon.  I like it when Robbins leaves reality and delves into the realm of fantasy.<br />These two books have the most elements of fantasy, but they never leave reality completely.  What an imagination he has!  And they way he turns a phrase and spins a metaphor leaves lovers of language well sated.<br />My third favorite book of his is &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;.  The Chink is a wonderful character and I really enjoyed his philosphy of life.  I won't tell you what it is because you should read it for yourself.  It is the most hedonistic of his novels.<br />All of his books are wonderful; but this is the first one I read and it will alway be near and dear to my heart.<br />So choose wisely: you will always be partial to the first Robbins novel that you read.  Actually, you can't make a wrong choice because they are all entertaining and imaginative with phrases spun like no other author I have ever read.  Enjoy!	2001-03-20

I saw this movie on video about a year ago, and certain scenes kept playing in my head.  I happened upon the book at the library one day so I picked it up and didn't put it down until I was done.  It was even funnier than the movie (except for the telephone to the jaw and ensuing fight scene where I almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard).  The book has a laid back feeling that you can't find in a Hollywood movie (Heaven forbid!) and you can sit back, relax, and have a great time.  My husband and I create Top 5 lists all the time now, but ours aren't as cool since they all revolve around our sons.  Maybe that could be a good sequel for Mr. Hornby: Top 5 happiest moments since he married Laura.  But even if he did write it (no way he'd write a sequel, he isn't American), a sequel is much too Hollywood for Mr. Cusack, thank goodness.  It's a fun read.	2001-03-06

Not often does a book so disturb me that I feel it in my guts.  The only other instance of that is John Kennedy Toole's &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;.  I couldn't finish that book because Ignatius was so well written that I found him completely disgusting and couldn't bear to read another word.  That's good writing.  And so is Oates' writing in depicting the Mulvaneys.  I was so frustrated by the characters' reactions to the rape that I found myself telling them to get over their individual hurts and deal with it as a family before everything goes wrong!  But it is fiction, so they don't get over themselves and everything does go wrong, for a while.<br />I love the use of animals to parallel the lives of the characters.  &quot;High Point&quot; is the name of the farm, and of course they have to leave a place called high point to hit the lows.  A previous review said that Eprhaim is a son of Joseph who symbolizes redemption. They live in Mt. Eprhaim!  These wonderful symbols added great depth to a disturbing story.<br />Some reviewers were complaining this book was too wordy.  That complaint calls to mind Mozart in the movie &quot;Amadeus&quot; when he was accused of using too many notes in his music. He said there were exactly as many notes as he required.  That is true with any artist, and so it is true with the artist Joyce Carol Oates.  She painted a picture of the power and frailty of family, and a potent picture it is.	2001-03-01

I loved Morrie, but I found Mitch very annoying.  He is a workaholic, and I am not, so I had absolutely nothing in common with him.  But give me Morrie's wisdom anyday!  He tells a great proverb about waves and the ocean that I will never forget.  My only guess as to why everyone loves this entire book is that they also fell in love with Morrie; I just hope they were not equally enamored of Mitch.  Shallow city.  But at least it is a short book so I didn't have to endure him for very long.  I am glad I read it, but this book did not live up to all of the hype.  I approach any book that is touted as a must read by so many people as one that reaches the lowest common denominator in our society, and that is not a good thing.  Read it because Morrie is a gem, not because everyone is telling you to read it.	2001-02-06

I received this book as a gift late in my first pregnancy (I purchased &quot;Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot; by Tracie Hotchner when I learned I was pregnant; it was great.  I especially loved the week by week development of my little fetus!) so I skipped everything but labor and delivery.  After I had my baby, I read the entire book (Okay, I admit it, I'm a nut, but I was bored and there was nothing else in the house to read) and I have to say I found it very scary.  It made me think that if I didn't eat enough kale I would have a baby with birth defects!  But so many pregnancy books are like that.  The chapters on labor were absolutely spot-on correct and you should read this book just for those chapters.  I recommend What to Expect the First Year and What to Expect the Toddler Years.  Those books are very helpful.  And the 7th edition of Dr. Spock is amazing.  He is right: you know more than you think you do.  This goes for pregnant women as well.  Just eat healthy foods in moderation so you don't gain too much weight, and drink plenty of water to flush out the amniotic fluid.

My husband woke up in the middle of the night saying, &quot;Earthquake!&quot; but it was just me laughing silently and shaking the bed.<br />Lionel has Tourrette's Syndrome and his tics lead him to burst out the funniest lines in the book.  One of his standbys is &quot;Eatmebailey&quot;.  We never find out who Bailey is.  That would have been a much better plot line than the detective story Lethem came up with.<br />I agree with some other reviewers that this should not have been a detective novel.  As soon as the flashback to his childhood is over and Lionel starts looking for the killer, whatever literary genius Lethem had rolling came to a screeching halt.  It was stock, with a twist; but not enough of a twist to warrant the overblown heraldings of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; as the newest installment in American literature.  <br />If Lethem had just left out the detective story and found a better plot for Lionel to come into his own, then it would warrant all of the high praise it has received.  Maybe next time, but I will definitely keep my eye on Jonathan Lethem.<br />Read this book for the sheer of enjoyment of listening to Lionel, and try not to let the plot get in your way.	2000-12-15

I have read the posted bad reviews (or as many as there were through the 220th review) and they did not convince me that this is a book not worth reading.  This is a book to be cherished and discussed because it is a work of literature.  <br />I had the pleasure of hearing Barbara Kingsolver on her book tour promoting &quot;Prodigal Summer&quot;.  Most of the questions from the audience were about Poisonwood, and Kingsolver expained her writing style.  She starts with a theme, then comes up with a question that the story must address.  After that she decides what voices are needed to explore and resolve the theme and the question.  This book started out with four narrators, but she realized that four points of view were not enough, so one character split into two, the twins Adah and Leah.  The theme of this book is redemption, and the question posed is how can we redeem ourselves after we have made mistakes.  All kinds of mistakes are made in this book by all of the main characters, and they are all seeking redemption, whether they know it or not.  Some do not find it, some stop looking, others do find it.  It is an epic journey spanning 30 years, and a story to be savored by her readers.  <br />There are a couple of posted reviews saying she needed to research this book more.  She researched this book for 20 years!  She had file cabinets full of information that she collected over the years; so much so that she referred to this book as 'The Damn Africa Book'.  She told a story of standing for hours in a zoo waiting for a green mamba snake to open its mouth so she could put it in this book.  She wrote every scene in this book from all five narrators' perspectives so that we could distinguish their voices without seeing the name at the beginning of the chapter.  It is her magnum opus, and readers who do not understand it are not serious readers of literature; they just don't get it.  <br />This is a book to be read, and re-read, and discussed, and studied, by readersof serious fiction.  It is not a light-hearted read, and it is not for everyone.  But for those of us who get it, we are in awe.	2000-12-14

I can't give this collection 5 stars because the first two stories are weaker than the last two.  But they are much shorter, and serve as an introduction into the depressing lives of the last two characters.  I don't know how the comparison to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; got started, but I can see why, especially with the violence of the last story.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll with a BIG difference: you actually care about these characters.  They are not two dimensional like Tarantino's characters; they have depth and breadth, and one cares what happens to them!  I grew up in rural Alaska, and the characters' experiences are not too different from my own, less the violence of the last story.  Eden Robinson spins a great yarn; one that is rooted in truth for me, and for others, I am sure. I read this book in a day, I couldn't put it down.

Anyway, it's a book of 52 stories that all show how to reach authentic power through multi-sensory perception.  One has to believe in these things in order to be receptive to this book's lessons.  If you aren't sure if you are ready for his philosphy, check out Gary Zukov's visits on Oprah.  She turned me onto Seat of the Soul and Gary Zukov, and now I never miss an episode when he is on.  If his take on life jibes with you, read both books and begin your journey toward authentic power.	2000-11-17

I hadn't read it since high school, so I picked up this new translation by the Nobel prize winning poet Seamus Heaney.  All I remember from my high school days is the underwater battle between Beowulf and Grendel's mom because that's the only part that made sense to me.  With this new translation the story came alive for me.  Those Anglo-Saxon spellings of names in previous translations really lost me.  But Mr. Heaney spells the names so they sound like modern day names, and it makes the reading flow.  And I love how the Anglo-Saxon is on the left page with the translation on the right page, so you can go back and forth to see which words haven't changed much in over a thousand years like gold, god, and world.  Pretty cool.  My husband read the poem, and he isn't even an English major!  It is a wonderful translation of an epic poem, and I recommend it highly.	2000-11-17

This book is a good place to start to figure out what areas you need help in, like anger or jealousy, etc.  I think that writers Dr. Phil McGraw and Gary Zukov, and men of that ilk, read this book when it first appeared in 1977 and based a lot of their ideas on it.  I really enjoyed this book, but it is only the first step to self-healing.  Read it, then move onto other books that concentrate on your needs.  For me that was &quot;Seat of the Soul&quot; by Garzy Zukov.  But for you it might be another book.  Deepak Chopra is a good place to go from here.  He and Dr. Dyer collaborated on a few projects, and I enjoy their talks on PBS that are run during fund drives.  Good luck in your journey!	2000-11-17

Whenever I read mysteries I never read the dust-jacket of the hardcover or back of the paperback because it ruins the plot for me.  I like to be surprised.  The beginning of the book would have been ruined if I had read the jacket, so thank goodness I didn't.  This is an entertaining mystery novel, set in Canada.  It has murder, a trial, and a gothic ending.  My fave mystery writer is Laurie King, but this was a refreshing change of pace.  I don't want to give anything away, but if you want a good mystery in a gothic-inspired setting, this book is for you.	2000-11-17

I loved it when I read it in high school (not for a class), and I love it even more now that I've taught it in high school English.  Students love it because of the narrative voice and the content, and they don't realize they are reading a classic of American fiction.  I've gotten some great essays and test scores from this book; proof that this book can engage even the most reluctant readers into reading literature.  And the discussion possibilities are endless: I learn something new every time I moderate class discussions.  The kids take over, and I only have to prompt them to dig a little deeper into the meaning to find a gem of an insight.  If you read it as a teen, re-read it and enjoy!  Share it with a friend, read it for book club, teach it; do not miss out on this book.	2000-11-17

An all-around great book that touches on many important issues like race and prejudice; filled with wonderful southern characters.  I showed &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; in class to give the kids an idea of life in rural Alabama during the depression, then started a three week study of the novel.  It is one of my favorites and should not be missed by anyone: teacher, student, or lover of American literature.	2000-11-17

My only gripe is that it read like a straight-forward memoir and not a novel.  There weren't any literary elements in it.  Other than that, I really enjoyed it.  Senna created a very believable world, one which I thoroughly identified with being from a mixed-race background and having grown up during the 70s.  The relationship between the sisters was beautiful, and one wonders how such selfish people as the mom and dad ever thought to have a child, let alone two.  The sisters only had each other to rely on, and when they are separated, the narrator's life stagnates, even though she is always on the move.  It is a fascinating story told with insight by a sage writer. I highly recommend it!	2000-11-05

World War II was the  background, but other than a few radio reports and letters from home, it  had no impact on the story.  Other than the narrator's girlfriend's father  rejecting him because he is Chinese, race is neglected as a theme when it  could have played a much larger role in the story.  Leprosy is a good plot  twist because it makes us think about outer v. inner beauty.  The garden  was an excellent symbol of life, but it's difficult to set a 200 page novel  around a garden, especially in this novel.  <br />I agree with another  reviewer who thought this was a short story that some editor thought should  become a novel.  Tsukiyama should have concentrated on leprosy and the  garden, and left the other elements of war and racism out completely,  because they were more of a distraction than real issues in the novel.	2000-09-08

I only bring mystery books on vacation, and this  was the first one I read in Puerta Vallarta over mid-winter break.  Not  only is it a great way to keep the sun off of your face while lying prone  on a beach chair, it is an intriguing story with wonderful characters.  I  prefer King's American style of mystery plots compared to the traditional  set-up of English writers like P.D. James.  James gives you the complete  cast of suspects, then slowly reveals who did it.  I won't give away how  King sets up this book, but it isn't the same as James!  <br />No trips to  Mexico this year with a new baby on the way, but when Baby Jack is born I  will definitely send my husband out to fetch me some more Laurie King  mysteries to wile away the hours of nursing my newborn, lying prone on a  bed this time around.	2000-08-23

It started out that way, but  fizzled into nothing at the end.  One of the most colorful characters was  not addressed at all in the final chapter; we were left wondering what  happened to her, when everything else was tied up into a neat little  package.  And the storyline of the dead body in the back yard failed to  materialize into anything interesting at the end of the book.<br />But those  complaints aside, the characters are very vivid, and I catch myself  thinking about them from time to time.  I especially liked one of the  grandaughters of the matriarch, the girl who survived her drunk, hippie  mother.  That struck a cord with me.<br />All in all it's a good read full of  wonderful characters, but the end is a bit of a disappointment.	2000-08-09

There is so much imagery to keep a club talking for hours!  I read a couple of the chapters in the New Yorker as short stories before the book was published, and I couldn't wait  to read the novel.  One aspect of the book that I found interesting was  that even though this book is set in Tokyo, the main characters seem more  Western than Japanese.  The opening scene has our hero cooking pasta for  lunch.  They drink coffee in the morning instead of tea, and beer instead  of sake.  Cliches and stereotypes are flouted in this novel.  At the end of  each day I couldn't wait to read the book, because the story is so  convoluted and the characters are all joined in a web, even though they  don't know it.  The prose is beautiful, the story is fascinating, the  characters are intriguing, and the imagery never quits.  It is a perfect  book club book, but also a great book to read over and over again to figure  out all of the connections.	2000-01-29
