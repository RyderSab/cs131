US	53007049	R26NHQ500FJ9GR	0618178929	682756243	The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2003 (The Best American Series)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Mixed bag	The best thing about a collection of essays like this is that you get to read articles by writers you've never heard of, on topics you never realized could be at least interesting and sometimes even compelling. The writing ranges from dry and technical to almost purely emotional. I can't think of a single dud, which is little surprise, given the editor.<br /><br />So, read it for elucidation or inspiration. You will come away with a few previously-unfamiliar names firmly lodged in your head for future reference, like Ian Frazier. The end of his (quite literally sensual) ode to icebergs is so beautiful it almost hurts. Here it is in full:<br /><br />\\"A lot of what is exciting about being alive can't be felt, because it's beyond the power of the senses. Just being on the planet, we are moving around the sun at 67,000 miles an hour; it would be great if somehow we could climb up to an impossible vantage point and actually feel that speed.<br /><br />\\"All this data we've got piling up is interesting, but short on thrills. Time, which we have only so much of, runs out on us, and as we get older we learn that anything and everything will go by. And since it will all go by anyway, why doesn't it all go right now, in a flash, and get it over with? For mysterious reasons, it doesn't, and the pace at which it proceeds instead reveals itself in icebergs.<br /><br />\\"In the passing of the seconds, in the one-thing-after-another, I take comfort in icebergs. They are time solidified and time erased again. They pass by and vanish, quickly or slowly, regular inhabitants of a world we just happened to end up on. The glow that comes from them is the glow of more truth than we can stand.\\"	2004-05-29

With inheritance, however, you can overload a base class member function with a member function in a subclass as well.\\"<br />However, by the time this book gets to where that quote is lifted from (roughly halfway through), Mr. Davis has done quite a credible job of preparing you for it. He sometimes falls down badly: his explanation of pointers completely neglects to mention the implicit referencing that is part of every normal assignment statement. The expression \\"variableX = variableY\\" (in all computer languages) actually means \\"the address pointed to by variableX is assigned the value pointed to by variableY\\", not \\"variableX is given the value of variableY\\". Most students would be much less confused by pointers if he had started his discussion by pointing out that all variables are actually pointers by nature.<br />Given the rather astonishing subtlety, complexity, and even beauty of full-bore C++, 400-odd pages are not going to make you into an overnight master (reading Stroustrup is the only way to do that) . The pace is extremely rapid, but the author succeeds fairly well in what he sets out to do, which is to explain the most complex computer language (by far) in clear and understandable terms.<br />If you have no programming background and no outside help, you will be quickly lost. And yet I firmly believe that C++ is the best language for a beginning programmer to start with, even if for no other reason than to avoid the development of bad habits.<br />I am still searching for a book that will thoroughly explain the fundamentals of programming from the ground up, using C++ as the starting point. However, if you do have some programming experience, and want to bootstrap your way to C++, this book is a good choice.<br />The \\"humour\\", on the other hand...the ground up, using C++ as the starting point.

Thinking that a new edition would improve things, I ordered this one, but there is very little difference between versions.<br />A short, introductory text for beginners can get away with describing \\"how-to\\" while going light on \\"why-to,\\" but only if the instructions are error-free and complete. The authors would have been better to leave out the extensive sections on history and commercial methods and concentrate purely on simple systems suitable for the home. They could also have explained a little more why things are done the way they are.<br />For example: many pages are devoted to the description of methods for circulating nutrient solution, either by hand or automatically. Why nutrients are circulated is barely mentioned. The reader is left wondering why a constant flow of the same nutrient solution is better than just leaving the solution where it is. (Answer: for the same reason that blood circulates.)<br />So, a maddening book, but still a useful one. I used it to design some cedar window-boxes, fed by inverted 2-litre soda bottles that look like enormous IVs.<br />After modifying my design to account for the authors' nearly-fatal omission that their choice of growing medium, perlite, is actually lighter than water (!), the tomatoes and herbs exploding out of my boxes now block the sun, and the neighbours are jealous of my IV-covered walls.	2003-06-30

When I saw this one, I picked it up and was back home before I even thought to open it. Having owned their \\"Quick-Simmering Soups\\" title for a few years, I knew this one would have the same wonderful photographs, the same restful layout using multi-coloured fonts, the same excellent index and, most importantly, the same sort of inspired simple recipes.<br />Leafing through it for this review, I start to salivate like a Pavlovian dog. I'm going to be doing much gushing here so I should mention at the outset the one real flaw: every recipe has an estimated time to completion (rarely more than 30 minutes), and I find almost all hilariously optimistic. Oh, perhaps if someone had already done the mise en place for me...<br />Unlike the \\"Soups\\" title, this book has a few near-duds in it. Most of the duds are adaptations of popular recipes that just suffer by comparison. The Vegetable Minestrone struck me as not just light but also thin, a pale imitation of one of the world's great soups. The Indian Chicken soup is not something that I would serve to an Indian, but on the other hand, I would serve the Curried Ham & Pasta salad, though I would hope I wasn't asked for the recipe, because it achieves its wonderful result by cheating audaciously.<br />Actually, \\"Cheating Audaciously\\" would be a good alternate title for the book. Most of the cheating works just fine, but I take exception to a couple of practices. An otherwise wonderful-looking Teriyaki Chicken Noodle salad actually uses the little envelope of MSG-loaded \\"flavouring\\" that ramen noodles come with. When I open a package of ramen noodles, the first thing I do is throw away that envelope. Let's get the rest of the flaws out of the way so we can move on to more pleasant things. It's just a matter of personal taste, but I found the pairing of salmon with strawberries to be odd in the extreme. Finally, the Spaghetti alla Carbonara and the Thai Pork & Vegetable Curry both have the \\"suffering by comparison\\" problem.<br />So, why does it still get five stars, when I have found fault with six of the recipes? Easy, because that leaves exactly 60 recipes that I find no fault with at all! I've only had this book for a few months, so I've only made about twenty of the recipes, but the other forty are on my to-do list, and they are all recipes that I would happily make for the first time with guests arriving. Standouts? To quote the Mediterranean Mostaccioli recipe: \\"The mix of chunky vegetables, fresh basil, feta cheese and ground lamb is country cooking at its simple best.\\" The Tuna & Pasta Alfredo, while not one of my personal favourites, is an astonishingly easy way to get broccoli into small children. That recipe is also one of the few that I am able to make within the 25 minute time estimate. There is a wonderful recipe for asparagus with pasta in a light cream-cheese sauce, but my two favourites are both soups. The Crab & Pasta Gazpacho is another 25 minute recipe with guaranteed-wonderful results, and finally, I completely agree with the blurb for the Spring Green Pasta Soup: \\"Thin strips of cooked egg, exquisite spring vegetables, and wispy threads of angel-hair pasta compose a delicate soup with the airy lightness of a heavenly omelet.\\"<br />There go those saliva glands again...ara and the Thai Pork & Vegetable Curry both have the \\"suffering by comparison\\" problem.<br />So, why does it still get five stars, when I have found fault with six of the recipes?

The misleading title complaint is only because this isn't just a book of pasta sauces, unless you consider things like Fusilli con Polpettine (Fusilli with meatballs) or Penne alla Alberoni (baked penne with shrimp and mushrooms) to be just a sauce.<br />By the way, the meatballs and the baked penne are two of my top 10 favourite recipes -- I perfected the meatball recipe, and I'm forever messing around with the penne, using scallops instead of shrimp, adding sake, feta cheese, green and waxed beans (but steam or zap those first, I discovered). It is such a foolproof recipe that it is possible to experiment like that and still know that dinner will be ready in 30 minutes, and that your guests will love it and demand the recipe.<br />Warning: This is NOT a Westernized cookbook, it is an unapologetically Italian cookbook with extremely authentic recipes. There is very little meat in most of these recipes, and pairings of things that would rarely be thought of outside of Italy, like a main dish composed entirely of pasta, chickpeas, and celery.<br />However, if you are prepared to be adventurous, and would like a source of wonderful meals that take less than 30 minutes to prepare, then this is the book for you. Come home exhausted, put a big pot of water on, sit down and relax until it boils, then create Linguine alle Olive in ten minutes flat. Linguine, garlic, black olives, olive oil, parsley salt, parmesan on the side, is all. You can dramatically change the recipe just by choosing what kind of black olives, from regular mild canned olives to intense oily kalamatas (I recommend the latter).<br />This book is completely filled with recipes like that. I much prefer photographs of finished dishes in cookbooks, but the fanciful illustrations here (by Robert Budwig) turn the book into a work of art.<br />Not all of the recipes are quickies, but the slower ones are where Ms. Seed does most of her teaching. You literally have NO idea what Spaghetti Bolognese is until you have spent a couple of hours making her version (only a half hour of that time requires your presence in the kitchen).<br />I've had this book for several years, so it is now dog-eared and much scribbled upon. I must have made at least thirty of the recipes, with only one dud, and that just because my palate just couldn't encompass the idea of having lemon as the overriding flavour in a main dish.<br />In summary: a wonderful cookbook, mostly full of very simple recipes that call for little time and few (but excellent) ingredients, coupled with a few time-consuming spectacular creations for special occasions.<br />Now, do yourself a favour and check out the BEST Italian cookbook...recipes are quickies, but the slower ones are where Ms. Seed does most of her teaching.

The authors have saved me years of hit-and-miss attempts at recipes, by doing the work themselves and explaining what works and what doesn't and, most importantly, why.<br />It is certainly one of the most valuable cookbooks I own, but it is not one of my favourites. It is utterly emotionless, and almost completely lacking in photographs. It is also too big and heavy to fit in my plexiglass cookbook holder. It is really more of a textbook than a cookbook, which is why it ended up in my bathroom. If I want to make (say) polenta or risotto, I will first consult this book to find out the physics and chemistry of polenta or risotto, and then will grab one of my favourite Italian cookbooks (like Diane Seed, for example) and approach that recipe armed with solid technical knowledge.<br />When I started writing this review, I gave the book only 4 stars, but I find I have to raise it to five: the amount of invaluable work that went into it is astonishing, and I do really consult it almost daily. I just rarely actually make recipes out of it. Another downside is the index, which is almost completely unuseable -- you may think that you are in the &quot;B&quot; section, and may be mystified why you can't find what you are looking for, but you might actually be in the &quot;bacon&quot; section -- impossible to tell from the tiny indentation differences and the complete lack of colour cues.<br />Strange that I seem to be slamming a book that I use almost daily. Nonetheless, that's what I'm doing, while still giving it 5 stars.	2003-04-08

The layout is the only way to go: recipe on one page, and photograph of the completed dish on the other. Lots of input for visually-oriented males (or females), but also no need to turn pages when your hands are covered with flour or whatever.<br />And the recipes are truly different. On the strength of this book, I bought another of the \\"50 Ways With...\\" titles, about chicken, but it turned out to be an endless procession of \\"boneless chicken breast with [fill in the blank] sauce\\" recipes.<br />I think I might have made all 45 gems. Let me give you a partial list of recipes that I have confidently made for the first time with company arriving shortly:<br />Baked Fish Nicoise: (startlingly light and tasty -- perfect for a female guest).<br />Baked Fish With Broccoli<br />Chili Con Pesce: (wonderful idea, but it needed a little adjusting)<br />Continental Fish Cakes: (I laid in 2 lb of fresh cod for four people, but could easily have gone through twice as much).<br />Fish Florentine: (one of the ten best things I've ever delivered to the table).<br />Fish With a Mustard and Herb Crust: After eating something similar at the Black Dog on Martha's Vineyard, I came home and violently tore into my cookbooks until I found this superior equivalent. Give the World's cod population three or four years to recover (this is 2003), then treat yourself to pure fish heaven.<br />Enough gushing - There is a dud. The Fish and Fennel Gratin just does not work at all. If I was crazy enough about the concept, I would bake the fennel \\"blind\\" for 25 minutes, then add the fish and topping and continue baking, but there are far finer things to pursue in this world, like the Old English Fish Pie. I have authority here, since I come from the Old Country, and this remarkably-simple recipe does an absolutely wonderful job of balancing fresh and smoked fish flavours in a dish that just vanishes as soon as it is set down on the table. My fish-hating stepdaughter inhaled about a quart of it before thinking to ask what was in it.<br />So, to summarize: Out of my 200+ cookbooks, this one ranks in the top ten.a quart of it before thinking to ask what was in it.<BR>So, to summarize: Out of my 200+ cookbooks, this one ranks in the top ten.	2003-04-08

I have five of them (in my 200 cookbook collection), and they all get used regularly. I love the layout: photographs of each and every recipe right on the page containing the complete recipe. These books stay cleaner than most of my cookbooks, because it is NEVER necessary to turn a page while making a recipe.<br />The two gripes I do have are that each recipe also has two or three photographs that supposedly show technique, but actually are all laughably pointless. It would have made much more sense to do away with them and increase the recipe font, which is rather small -- I literally have to use a magnifying glass to make out fractions.<br />But if I'm complaining, why the five stars? Easy -- the recipes are wonderful! I couldn't begin to list my favourites, so instead I'll just open to a page at random and ... Risotto with Chicken on one side, Cannelloni al Forno on the other. The cannelloni is one of my standards -- I like to make several batches at a time and freeze them. Then I just defrost it in the fridge overnight, pour the sauce over it, and bake it -- total elapsed time for making dinner? Two minutes.<br />The risotto recipe I have not made, but it looks great: a subtle blending of chicken with Parma ham and saffron. The author points out quite correctly that home-made chicken stock would be best used for this recipe.<br />Opening to another page at random produces the same result: Chicken Stroganoff is a very simple adaptation that works wonderfully well. On the facing page is Chicken Pancakes, which I have not made, but I will, soon -- probably substituting tortillas for the pancakes.<br />Too many chicken cookbooks are far too full of \\"boneless chicken breasts with [you name it] sauce\\" recipes. This book wanders over the entire world, using authentic ingredients everywhere, with wonderful results.	2003-04-07

Whenever I see another one, I immediately buy it without bothering to look inside. Not one of the recipes I've made from these books was a dud, and most of them were exceptional.<br />The most recent recipe I made from this book is Spicy Chicken and Mushroom Soup, which turned out to be one of the best things I have ever made. Many of these recipes are somewhat exotic, pairing ingredients that you would never think to pair, like watercress and orange, but the results are often spectacular.<br />The book wanders the world, delivering absolutely-authentic recipes. When a friend called to say his date had cancelled, so instead he was bringing a Moroccan friend, I was quickly able to serve what she enthusiastically claimed was the best Harira she'd ever had.<br />Sometimes, the author will take an ethnic soup, and greatly modify it, to its eternal benefit. One recipe I was already familiar with -- a Ghanaian recipe for okra and banana soup, gets completely transformed here by the addition of smoked cod.<br />But don't let me put you off by suggesting that this is a purely exotic cookbook: of the 30-odd recipes I've made, five of them were variations on tomato soup. Since there are 200-odd recipes in the book, there are still eight variations on tomato soup that I have not yet tried.<br />I have four or five cookbooks that are dedicated only to soup -- this one is my favourite.	2003-04-07

That is testimony to the quality of &quot;The Cook's Encyclopedia of&quot; series, of which this is one, though it has been renamed for some reason.<br />I was initially disappointed, because my idea of one-pot cooking is that the contents of the one pot be a main dish, not a side dish. Many of these recipes are really side dishes. Not many people would consider Ratatouille as being a main dish, for example.<br />So why the five stars? Well, the ratatouille recipe is the best one I've ever seen -- simply wonderful! Also true of the other 20-odd recipes I've made from this book. Commenting on the review by Mr. Moore, where he says &quot;the spices and combination of ingredients have a decidely European feel&quot;: He is quite correct, when the dish is a European one, such as Jansson's Temptation, Seafood Risotto, Cassoulet, or Italian Lamb Meatballs with Chilli Tomato Sauce (all of which are excellent, by the way -- the tricky risotto is particularly well-explained).<br />However, when the book moves further afield, to Morocco for five different tagines (the shellfish one is particularly good), or to India for a Goan Fish Casserole, or to Thailand for a tofu curry, I can assert that the ingredients, spices and techniques are absolutely authentic to their regions.<br />As with all of this series of books, the layout is almost perfect -- they'd be better eliminating the pointless &quot;technique&quot; photographs and enlarging the recipe font, but it is never necessary to turn a page while working on a recipe. The comprehensive index also works well -- rare in a cookbook.<br />I've only found one recipe where I immediately disagree with the author, and that is the otherwise excellent Chicken Gumbo. Where is the file roux? I know that excellent gumbos can be made without file, but if you're only going to include one gumbo recipe, it should have file in it. Strange omission, because the other recipe from Louisiana, the Jambalaya, is completely authentic.<br />One other gripe is that slow cookers are never mentioned, even though slow cookers are an absolute natural for many of these dishes. The author goes on at length about the different types of clay pot, but I have never noticed any actual advantage to clay pot cooking except for the presentation, when you walk into the dining room with tagine in hands, place it in the middle of the table, and whisk the top off with a flourish. It's just a small gripe, however, because most of these recipes can be done in a slow cooker without any change whatsoever except for increased cooking time.<br />I have five books from this series, and all five of them reside permanently on the top shelf of my 200+ cookbook library.

The Gatto recipe should come with a warning to not make it more than once a week. I did go back to it recently, making it for a vegetarian lady friend using smoked mackeral instead of salami, and the results were everything that a bachelor could hope for.<br />I must have ten Italian cookbooks, including Diane Seed's excellent &quot;Top 100 Pasta Sauces,&quot; but this one is my favourite. I much prefer cookbooks with photographs of each recipe, but the illustrations by Helen Semmler here are just beautiful.<br />And the recipes: There are more unique and authentic recipes here than in my other nine Italian cookbooks combined. A couple of the dishes introduce an entirely new way to think about an entree. Scrigno di zucchini e gamberi (jewel boxes of prawns and courgette) introduced me to the concept of the three-dimensional weightless entree. As Ms. Seed points out, that particular recipe can be made ahead of time, and when the guests arrive, requires only ten minutes in the oven before you can serve your guests a spectacular amuse-bouche, appetizer, or main course. I have made at least ten variations on that recipe (try it with diced swordfish instead of the shrimp), and my family is now completely conditioned to enthusiastically receive experimental three-dimensional entrees.<br />There are a few recipes in here that are a little TOO authentic: I cannot see myself ever making Colli di pollo ripeni (Chicken neck stuffed with beef) or Polpi affogati (drowned octopus), but the other 95% of the recipes are refreshing challenges. I don't often make standard ravioli, because it is just too time-consuming and I find it difficult to ensure that they all seal: In here is a foolproof, quick and simple recipe for Raviolo aperto (Open Ravioli) that will satisfy my ravioli-cravings for the rest of my life. To quote Ms. Seed: &quot;Gualtiero Marchesi was one of the first restaurant owners to introduce a 'new look' in Italian cooking. His open ravioli has become one of the great modern classics.&quot; Richly-deserved praise.<br />I'm still working my way through this book, like I still wonder what Cupola di crepes Gerard (cupola of pancakes) will be like, given that it consists of thin pancakes filled with mushrooms, ham, gruyere and parmesan cheeses, all doused with a simple bechamel sauce. If the other 30-odd recipes from this book that I've made are a guide, it will be spectacular, and the recipe will be reliable enough to make for the first time with guests arriving shortly.<br />Ms. Seed is completely reliable, and this book in particular is a relevation.est of my life.

I've given up on folding page corners over to mark recipes, because most every page got folded over.<br />I would attempt to give it six stars, if there were more photographs, and they were facing their actual recipes, but you can't have everything in life.<br />In the meantime, I'll make do with this book. On one page, she will challenge you to make your own potsticker wrappers, and you really should try to if you want to know what heights potstickers can ascend to, but on the next page, she will feed you sublimely-easy soul-food pierogies.<br />Not a book for a rookie cook, and do not try to make any of the recipes for the first time when guests are arriving shortly, but she details just what parts of a recipe can be made ahead, and exactly how far ahead. Most recipes come with extensive &quot;cook's notes&quot; giving advice and alternate versions of the recipe. Take a practice run at a recipe first, then make it for real and watch your reputation just soar.<br />Even the index works well, unusual in a cookbook.<br />Favourite recipes from this book? There wouldn't be space. Just allow me to quote from the endpapers of the previous edition (which I am passing on as soon as this edition gets to me):<br />&quot;Nicole Routhier shows how the simple pancake can be transformed into a Norwegian lefse, Russian blintz, French crepe, Mexican burrito, Chinese mu-shu.<br />&quot;She lets us sample 'Ladies in a Sarong,' peppery little meatballs dressed in Asian flat noodles and dressed again in lettuce leaves, before moving on to coulibiac, a sumptuous salmon pie with Russian roots and a French accent, and then serves up turon, a sweet tropical strudel from the table of the Phillipine merienda. Through it all, we never forget the essential secrets of a velvety brioche, a feathery puff pastry, the flakiest phyllo, and the silkiest of pastas.<br />&quot;'Cooking Under Wraps' goes beyond delicious pastry coverings to explore crackling salt crusts, seamy beds of banana leaf, crispy rice-papers, juicy cabbage rolls, an much more.&quot;<br />I have just no idea what arc this Vietnamese/French woman could have possibly followed through life to allow her such mastery over so many absolutely distinct cuisines. I can always find picky little problems with a cookbook, like I sometimes have to turn pages while covered in dough, but that would be picayune of me here.<br />I am jealous of her skill, both in cooking, and writing about it.salt crusts, seamy beds of banana leaf, crispy rice-papers, juicy cabbage rolls, an much more.&quot;<br />I have just no idea what arc this Vietnamese/French woman could have possibly followed through life to allow her such mastery over so many absolutely distinct cuisines.

Resist this, if you can:<br />&quot;My real log is written in the sea and sky; the sails talking with the rain and the stars amid the sounds of the sea, the silences full of secret things between my boat &amp; me, like the times I spent as a child listening to the forest talk.&quot;<br />It is also a story about a competitive man who had the prize in his hands (winning a non-stop, solo around the world race), thought about all the cameras, newsmen, Brigitte Bardot in attendance et al, and decided to just keep on sailing.<br />Oh yes, and the book is chock-full of extremely good advice about blue-water sailing.

I read this book cover to cover in one sitting, and loved it. I also learned the techniques of modern Chinese cooking in detail, including how to shop.<br />The book's problem is that the recipes are designed for a restaurant kitchen, with staff on hand. I have made exactly one dish from it. It took me half a day, and contained endless steps that could easily be shortened or eliminated if you didn't happen to have, say, a staff of 5 on hand. The result was wonderful, and I've made an equally-good version of it many times since, but not before going through the recipe with a LARGE pair of pruning shears.<br />But buy it anyway. The advice in the side columns alone is worth the price of entry, and the pantry section...<br />The pantry section is where the fifth star comes from. The infused oils are amazing, the pickled ginger (right down to the brand names of the vinegars -- and don't even THINK about substituting!) is sublime...<br />The firmament of cooking lost a bright star when Barbara Tropp died.	2002-12-06

The authors do a wonderful job of assembling and presenting the evidence.<br /><br />It doesn't matter at all that you know the complete story before you start (but if you don't want to know, simply skip the rest of this paragraph): A guy's marriage and business ventures are in shambles; he hoodwinks a town into building him a bad plywood trimaran for an around-the-world race; he gets scared and fakes everything by staying in the Atlantic and sailing in circles; he goes nuts and walks overboard.<br />An amazing study of the human mind under pressure -- I commend the authors.<br /><br />This book will shake you up.

The text is simplistic, skimming the surface of a topic that people can devote a rich lifetime to studying.<br />I bought it on the price and the strength of the cover photograph, because I'm Scottish (i.e. cheap), felt ambitious, and wanted to build a circular staircase from scratch.<br />The book doesn't touch on that subject at all. The cover \\"photograph\\" is actually a poorly-rendered computer graphic, and the text inside matches it well.<br />(By the way: DO NOT attempt to build a circular staircase from scratch unless you have years of woodworking under your belt, a very complete workshop at your disposal, are completely comfortable with extremely complex geometry, and have a source of income that allows you infinite free time :-)	2002-11-25

He doesn't actually recommend one model of saw over another (that would date the book very quickly), but instead explains the strengths and weaknesses of the various features.<br />With the knowledge I gained, I was able to make a smart purchase. I wish I'd had a larger budget, but with this book in hand, I was able to align and tune my cheapish purchase to perfection. Taking his advice, I made a few choice accessory purchases (such as the Ripstrate) that improved accuracy and safety remarkably.<br />Two years later, this is still the only table saw book I own, though it's dog-eared by now. Mr. de Cristoforo is excellent at describing techniques, and the many accessory and jig plans he provides help turn my fairly-good machine into a precision device, good for just about anything 'cept mitering expensive 8' trim sections (as I found out today to my chagrin...)<br />A final testimony: I'm trying to switch my career to finish carpenter/cabinetmaker, and am now avidly in search of his out-of-print book \\"Woodworking For Beginners.\\" I'm not a beginner any more, but I'm sure this man can teach me things I don't know.	2002-09-20

As I write, my family is collapsed in a heap after GORGING on Ms. Brody's bourguignon.  It took me a full hour to prep, but next time I'll save 20 minutes and considerable mess by browning the meat before marinating (I'll also double the recipe!)  Over time, I'll doubtless make other changes until I get the recipe exactly the way I want it, but that is true of any recipe in any cookbook.  Too many duck recipes? This is a cookbook, not the Constitution! I've made two of the duck recipes so far, with no sighting of an actual duck anywhere, and I've been delighted with both.<br />So, this is a nice little book, full of welcome ideas. However, when one can get (say) 400+ pages of Daniel Boulud for about the same price, it becomes a rather expensive, slim volume.  I have lived with it for a month now, and I am nonetheless quite happy with it. What follows are some of my further observations:<br />The &quot;Pantry&quot; section is excellent, probably the core of the book. The black bean and chickpea recipes effortlessly deliver fresh-cooked beans ready for use in anything.  For example, the total working time to transform a pile of raw chickpeas into an catering-size vat of hummus is about 15 minutes.<br />The infused oil recipe is a bit hit-and-miss. However, the idea itself is great.  The addition of an oil thermometer and a partially-closed lid quickly transforms the cooker into an accurate scientific apparatus, capable of very precise, effortless infusions. Try infusing olive oil with lemon zest next time you need your senses stimulated (then use the oil in a bread recipe, next time you need your whole house stimulated :-)<br />If your cooker is big enough (oval, preferably) The lamb stew with potato and feta crust can be economized and much improved by using a well-trimmed 1/2 leg. Let it cool when done, then shred the meat off the bone by hand.<br />The Chicken Merlot with Mushrooms is wonderful, with the mushrooms still crisp after cooking for 4 hours.  Rather too much liquid, though (true of many of the recipes here).<br />The Morroccan Chicken with Prunes &amp; Couscous is my favourite so far, but it would better served with plain couscous and a separately-cooked side dish, as the flavour is otherwise too intensely uniform.<br />Only one significant gripe (apart from the price): The layout designer sometimes sacrificed utility for artsiness, unnecessarily  spreading some recipes across three pages, with little or no indication that there is more to come.nd-miss.

It is made of very heavy,  glossy paper that  displays the many photographs beautifully. Most of the book is laid out the  way I much prefer - photo on one page and complete recipe on the facing  page. Only a few longer recipes force you to turn the page mid-recipe -  those are the ones that get decorated with most of the flour/soy sauce  fingerprints.<br />The book doesn't just concentrate on fillings - there are  instructions for making some of the most popular Asian wrappers from  scratch - not many people will go that route, I suspect (I haven't as yet),  but it is nice to have the option there.<br />Some of the recipes are nothing  short of brilliant. I've always struggled with sesame oil - I love the  flavour, but it is far too easy to swamp a recipe with it. Ms. Simond is a  master of the stuff -- her sesame vinaigrette is alone worth the price of  the book. She uses sesame oil in several of the filling recipes, too, and  the results are always wonderful.<br />Some of her other recipes, while always  interesting, exhibit some rather strange choices. The first time I make an  unfamiliar recipe, I like to follow it exactly, because I can never be sure  what its author intended.  Only when I make the recipe again will start to  incorporate my own ideas into it. I wouldn't advise doing that with this  cookbook - if you are merrily cooking along, and read something that gives  you pause, like adding Â½ lb of frozen peas to an otherwise wonderful  filling, or using \\"finely-chopped lemongrass\\" rather than  \\"lemongrass  pureed in a blender so that you don't have to hand toothpicks out to your  guests,\\" then by all means make the change immediately.<br />With that one  caveat out of the way, I can highly recommend this cookbook.	2000-08-18

I find it useful as a quick reference to jog my mind, but the core of the book -- the code samples -- are RIDDLED with errors.  If you are new to C++, the errors  make the book almost unusable.<br />However, if you already know C++ and just  want a quick reminder, the syntax errors are actually somewhat USEFUL --  they stop you from blindly copying code, and thus keep you thinking about  what you are doing.	2000-07-11

If the recipes weren't so very good, my family would surely be dog-tired of pies and turnovers by now, because I can't seem to stop making them! I literally had to start decorating my productions so that we could  distinguish the three or four kinds we usually have on hand.<br />The book has  two parts, one on wrappers, and one on fillings. Wrappers are further  subdivided into yeasted, pastry, and ready-made wrappers. Fillings are  split into Savoury, Vegetarian Savoury, and Sweet. I have no sweet tooth  whatsoever, so I can't comment on the sweet fillings, but of the fifteen or  twenty savoury fillings I've made so far, there has only been one dud.<br />So  why only four stars? <br />1) The section on pastry wrappers could be a little  longer, with more instruction on the often-devilish details of  pastry-making.<br />2) I like my fillings to have interesting textures. Ms.  German seems to prefer purÃ©eing everything.<br />3) She has a tendency to  overcook fillings (astonishing comment, coming from a Brit!)<br />4) She has a  fondness for frozen vegetables.<br />The last three quibbles are obviously  easily rectified by adjusting the recipes to your taste.<br />Highlights:  Spicy Asian Chicken, Chinese Orange Beef, Piroshki, and both of the  empanada recipes.<br />Ladies and Gentlemen, start your bread machines!	2000-04-03

It doesn't waste time with long-winded explanations of what variables  are or what recursion is. It assumes you know all that stuff and quickly  explains its four topics.<br />I can't vouch for most of the HTML section,  because I already knew HTML, but I didn't know CSS (Cascading Style  Sheets), and they are handled succinctly here in about fifty terse pages,  sprinkled with very clear examples.<br />The one exception to the  &quot;adult&quot; level of explanation is a chapter on OOP (Object-Oriented  Programming) for people new to it.<br />1200+ pages for $40?

If you think all of Sci Fi is just techno -- full of richly realized machines and ciphered characters, this novel will  open your eyes.<br />HOWEVER, one  small piece of advice to potential readers.

It is packed with truly helpful, and sometimes  ingenious, suggestions on how to fix just about any possible kitchen  problem. Don't have enough broccoli? &quot;Cover it up with hollandaise  sauce.  Everyone knows hollandaise sauce is terribly rich, so they'll eat  less.&quot;<br />As you can see, the advice is not served plain.  The authors  obviously decided to have fun while writing, and the result is often  startlingly funny.  I read this book from cover to cover, laughing often,  and learning plenty in the process.  Bland mushrooms?  Add marjoram.  Overdone steak? &quot;Continue cooking it until it is completely charred  and use it to scratch pictures on the walls of your cave.&quot; Ketchup  won't pour?

I certainly couldn't!  After getting the first &quot;Magic&quot; title, I quickly added the other two.  I've never even glanced at another bread machine book since - to do so would seem almost disloyal.<br />Oh, the three  books are not perfect - in the recipes, the fractions are often hard to  read, and the &quot;Hints&quot; book rather annoyingly repeats several  recipes from the first book, but those are the ONLY gripes I can come up  with.<br />Having had my bread machine for only 100 days, you might think me  unqualified to write a review.  Not so!  In those 100 days, I have made at  least 100 loaves or batches of dough.  I bake so many loaves and pies that  I have to give them away, to surprised and very grateful recipients.<br />I  bought this book after my very first loaf was a disaster.  It then took  ninety-plus batches to get to my second disaster, when I didn't take time  for the all-important &quot;dough check.&quot;  Actually, the &quot;dough  check&quot; text didn't find its way into every recipe until &quot;More  Bread Machine Magic&quot; -- a good enough reason to buy that book first.  Other reasons for buying &quot;More&quot; first are that it includes  recipes for 2 lb machines, and also has the best and prettiest recipe of  all: &quot;Jim's Torta Rustica.&quot;  Bake it with a pie bird peeking out  of the middle, and the top brushed with a little egg yolk/heavy cream wash.  Be prepared for gasps when you take it out of the oven, followed shortly  by demands for second helpings.<br />If you like the filled bread recipes, and  wish there were more, I would recommend Donna German's &quot;Edible Pockets  for Every Meal,&quot; but be warned: having the &quot;Bread Magic&quot; and  &quot;Edible Pockets&quot; books together in your kitchen can be addictive,  and can cause a near-permanent change to your eating habits.	2000-03-09

This was my 8th Thai cookbook, when I thought it unlikely there was much else for me to learn.<br />Little did I know! The book is laid out beautifully, with (mostly) one recipe to a page. There are no photographs,  but the gorgeous illustrations by Helen Semmler more than make up for them.  Each recipe is preceded with a short, instructive commentary.<br />The  recipes themselves ... if you are the type of person who, when in a new  restaurant, will look for a dish you are not familiar with and smile  broadly when told: &quot;Oh, you wouldn't like that,&quot; then you MUST  track down a copy of this book. There are more unusual and unique dishes,  and new tastes, in this slim volume than in all the rest of my Thai  cookbooks together.<br />This is my textbook when I teach Thai cuisine. I used  to feel like an impostor when Thai natives would sometimes take my class -  not any more! I just lead off with &quot;Nam Prik Kai Kem&quot; (relish of  salty duck eggs with fresh vegetables - it might take you several years to  acquire a taste for it) to establish my credentials.<br />Especially  interesting are the primitive dishes, like Gaeng Som Pla Tua Fak Yaew (sour  orange curry with snake beans), that date from before chilies were  introduced to Thailand by the Portuguese. It is fascinating to make some of  the historical dishes completely authentically -- without chilies and using  only pepper for heat.<br />One particular Royal Thai appetizer, Saeng Wa Gung  Pao, aptly described by Mr. Thompson as: &quot;the quintessence of good  Thai food,&quot; is the single finest dish I have ever made - well worth  the trouble of tracking down the ingredients. Royal Thai cuisine is not yet  well known in America, which is a crying shame.  One Royal Thai recipe that  I haven't yet tried, Kao Chae (perfumed rice with garnishes) lists 61  ingredients!<br />Mr. Thompson's more familiar dishes, like the Red, Green,  and Mussaman curries, are also several cuts above the norm.  No canned  curry pastes here!  However, that brings up another thought: this is not an  everyday cookbook for production-line family meals.  For all the accolades  I'm heaping on it, I find I use the book infrequently.  When I NEED to make  a meal, I usually turn to canned pastes and something like Charmaine  Solomon's book.  When I choose to take an entire day to play in my kitchen,  I reach for my mortar and pestle, and this book.<br />A final note: Amazon has  this David Thompson mixed up with the prolific writer of Westerns, so the  link on this page to &quot;an interview with David Thompson,&quot; if  followed, will not teach you anything about Thai cuisine.ed  curry pastes here!

Mistake! Halfway  through another night of carefully cutting unsalted butter into Â¾&quot;  cubes, wrapping them individually in plastic wrap, putting 2/3rd of  them  in the fridge and the rest in the freezer, all the while muttering  &quot;Ours is not to reason why...&quot;, Ms. Beranbaum's lovely photo on the  back cover got decorated with a short moustache that makes her look a  little like .. eh ... let's be polite and say &quot;Charlie  Chaplain.&quot;<br />I'll leave it to others to sing this book's well-deserved  praises. If you just want to get dinner on the table, it is not for you. I  recently spent eight hours over three nights making her chicken pot pies.  The result? My wife fainted clean away, and my teenager actually lifted her  head out of her plate and pronounced (as close as I can approximate):  &quot;Snumpf!&quot; A month later, my wife still gets a  bit wobbly when  she thinks of those pies, but I mostly remember the two nights of fish  sticks that preceded them.  It is not really fair to judge this book  harshly because it didn't suit my purposes at the time, but there are some  other real problems with it. Most glaring are the mistakes. In a book as  PRECISE as this one, the many mistakes really should have been weeded out  before publishing. I've only made 5 recipes so far, but 3 of them had  mistakes ranging from &quot;orphan&quot; ingredients to nonsensical  instructions.<br />The biggest disappointment is the dearth of savoury  recipes. Completely lacking a sweet tooth, 90% of the book is of no  interest to me. Yes, it is an American book, but anything calling itself a  Bible should be more inclusive. Where is that glory of British cuisine (oh  pipe down, you bloody Colonials...), Grosvenor Pie?<br />Enough badmouthing,  though. When my nest empties in a few years, I'll delight in taking a whole  weekend to explore a recipe or two (hopefully using a new, error-free  edition), and in the meantime, I now at least COMPLETELY understand what I  was doing with those cubes of butter.Colonials...), Grosvenor Pie? <br />Enough badmouthing,  though.

If  the recipes weren't so very good, my family would surely be dog-tired of  pies and turnovers by now, because I can't seem to stop making them! I  literally had to start decorating my productions with alphabetical pastry  cutouts (made with the help of a Play-Doh lettering kit), so that we can  distinguish between the three or four kinds we usually have on hand.<br />The  book has two parts, one on wrappers, and one on fillings. Wrappers are  further subdivided into yeasted, pastry, and ready-made wrappers. Fillings  are split into Savoury, Vegetarian Savoury, and Sweet. I have no sweet  tooth whatsoever, so I can't comment on the sweet fillings, but of the  fifteen or twenty savoury fillings I've made so far, there has only been  one dud.<br />So why only four stars?<br />1) The section on pastry wrappers  could be a little longer, with more instruction on the often-devilish  details of pastry-making.<br />2) I like my fillings to have interesting  textures. Ms. German seems to prefer pur&eacute;eing everything.<br />3) She has a  tendency to overcook fillings (astonishing comment, coming from a  Brit!)<br />4) She has a fondness for frozen vegetables.<br />The last three  quibbles are obviously easily rectified by adjusting the recipes to your  taste.<br />Highlights: Spicy Asian Chicken, Chinese Orange Beef, Piroshki,  and both of the empanada recipes.<br />Ladies and Gentlemen, start your bread  machines!	2000-02-28

THIS one became an instant favourite. Gorgeous fonts and use of color; perfect layout - mostly a photo on one page (for us visual-oriented  males ;-), and the complete recipe on the facing page. Most important: very  tasty, visually-appealing, and quick recipes.<br />There is nothing in the  book that isn't a photograph or recipe, yet I still think of it more as a  COOKBOOK than a recipe book -- after you've made a few of the soups, you'll  find yourself absorbing and adopting the common philosophy behind all these  recipes. Even the photographs suggest new ways of making and serving  soup.<br />I hardly need the actual book any more -- I just head off to the  produce section and grab whatever is freshest and most  appealing.<br />Favourite recipes? Out of the 60-odd here, I haven't found a  dud yet.	2000-02-14

I thoroughly enjoyed it and found lots of good advice, but too many topics are given cursory treatment. It is a long way short of &quot;Everything You Need to Know About Choosing, Using, and Enjoying Your Rv.&quot; Perhaps if  it was about twice as long, it might start to live up to its title.	1999-09-08
