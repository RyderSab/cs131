When this game was published in 1993, most people associated \\"Buck Rogers\\" with the 80's TV series starring Gil Gerrard.  A few people may have associated it with TSR's \\"Buck Rogers XXV\\" series.  Buck's historic origins, however, date back to two pulp novels and a spin-off comic strip beginning in 1929.  It is on this that the BR Adventure Game was based on.<br /><br />Although most people in the late teen/young adult age bracket (the primary buyers of RPG's) would not have known it, the original BR was not out fighting aliens or interplanetary fascists.  No, he was defending an embattled America against a world-conquering China.  I can see that going over well in 1929 when \\"The Yellow Peril\\" was a staple in popular fiction, but in 1993?  Didn't we renew China's status as a \\"most favored trading nation\\" that year?  Frankly, in this day and age setting my players against \\"yellow foreign devils\\" (a quote from the comic strip) seems rather awkward and embarassing.<br /><br />The game system is fairly simple and straightforward.  There are four stats; strength, aim, brains and health.  Each is given a descriptor with a ranking order; OK, good, better or best.  Each level gives youm a certain number of dice for use when you make a check (OK gives you two, good gives you three, etc.).  There are also skills which can be learned at basic or master levels, and experience chips you can earn in play, to give you additional dice.<br /><br />The system is easy to learn and moves quickly (essential for a high action game).  At the same time, however, it feels rather sparse.  Plus, the descriptors way it down more than they enhance the feel.  Why not just list an OK strength as \\"2 dice?\\"  Sure it doesn't sound as pretty, but it's more useful.<br /><br />My final analysis is this: the game system is good for simple, high action games, but not the best.  I much prefer \\"Story Engine\\" (also descriptor based) or \\"Cartoon Action Hour.\\"  As for the setting, it may appeal to hardcore nostalgia fans or KKK members, but that's about all.hardcore nostalgia fans or KKK members, but that's about all.	2005-08-20
US	51756719	R3KPSSUDAOM010	1929474601	347513199	StuperPowers Deluxe	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I love this game!	Humor and superpowers have a long history together, ranging from the 60's Batman TV series (admit it, you loved it as a kid), comics like \\"The Inferior Five\\" and movies like \\"Mystery Men.\\"  \\"Stuperpowers\\" combines superheroics and humor into an RPG.  As for any RPG, there are two main questions: 1) does it play well and 2) is it fun?  \\"Stuperpowers\\" succeeds on both counts, and even provides a rule book that is fun to read.    The thing that defines a superhero game is the list of available superpowers.  In \\"Stuperpowers\\" you start off with 3, chosen from a list that includes \\"turn bagels into lethal weapons,\\" \\"turn things plaid,\\" \\"teleport into your closet\\" and \\"bionic wet bar.\\"    For some it's a real exercise in imagination to make them useful, and this is where a lot of the fun lies.    As for the system, well, there are no stats, just a list of your powers and several levels of hurt ranging from \\"ok\\" to \\"KO'd.\\"  There are no dice either, all contests are resolved by playing rock-paper-scissors.  Humourous games thrive on speed and simplicity, and frankly, game play doesn't get much faster or simple than that.    As characters advance in levels they earn additional powers.  They also earn bonuses (\\"turn-ons\\") such as \\"spin doctors\\" and \\"super-genius pal.\\"  However, their increasing fame also earns \\"turn-offs\\" that might include paparazzi, stalkers or class-action suits.  This provides a novel and intriguing method of character advancement and development (something often lacking in humorous games) and adds tremedously to the game's humor potential.    If there is a downside to the game, it is the fact that several of the powers are definately R rated (\\"move someone's errogenous zones\\" and \\"concussive breasts\\" being two examples).  While this is not a problem for most adult gamers, it does make it awkward if you want to share the game with your kids.  Aside from this, \\"Stuperpowers\\" is a great deal for groups looking for a humorous game.	2005-08-20
US	51756719	RW3IAU21RG8DA	1932442227	699057451	Blue Rose RPG	Books	4	39	40	N	N	The wait is over	The pre-release material for \\"Blue Rose\\" suggested that it would take fantasy gaming in new directions.  When it was finally released in PDF format (the release date of the paperback version being unclear as of this writing) I snapped it up.  The following is my review of the PDF version, which may or may not reflect the paperback version when it is (eventually) released. <br /> <br />\\"Blue Rose\\" takes place in a unique fantasy world.  There are no elves, dwarves or other Tolkienesque trappings.  Neither is it a fantastic version of Earth's middle ages.  In this world nobles are chosen by an examination, the ruler is chosen by a divine messenger, and discrimination of race, gender or sexual orientation is unheard of.  Indeed, the almost Utopian nature of  the kingdom of \\"Blue Rose\\" has more in common with the land of Oz than Middle Earth or the Hyborian kingdoms.  While some players may snear at such \\"anachronistic\\" ideas (if such a term can be applied to a fantasy world), I for one, liked it.  Saving the kingdom is a popular theme in fantasy games, well here's a kingdom that I for one think is worth saving. <br /> <br />At this point, it is worth mentioning that \\"Blue Rose\\" is not intended to be played with a \\"hack-and-slash\\" mentality.  The book encourages exploring charcter development, personal motivations and non-violent solutions for problems.  This isn't to say that there can't be conflict, or even combat, simply that it shouldn't take center stage in \\"Blue Rose.\\" <br /> <br />The rules present five cultures of humans for one to play.  You can also choose between two non-human races (the magical Vata or the sea-folk) or an intelligent animal.  Again I liked that.  I am tired of elves, and every gaming group has a player who wants to be an animal. <br /> <br />The system is similar to the d20 system, but the antiquated elements have been shed.  The 3-18 scores for abilities have been dropped.  In \\"Blue Rose\\" all you have are the modifiers (i.e. +1, +2 etc.).Hit points have been dropped (applause!) in favor a damage roll/health level system like that in \\"Mutants and Masterminds.\\"  Finally, experience points are gone.  The DM determines when you have advance in levels. <br /> <br />The magic system has been revamped as well.  Gone are the endless lists of spells.  Instead, there are specific schools of magic, each with a list of uses that can be learned as skills.  Thus you have the animalism school, with abilities like beast-speech and beast-summoning, or the shaping school, which lets you shape fire or shape earth.  Some players might feel this approach is furstratingly limited, but to me it has a much better feel than the traditional D&D magic system. <br /> <br />My complaints about \\"Blue Rose\\" are few.  First, as the rules are written, all your character's skill levels go up every time you gain a level, and if you acquire new skills at higher levels you are automatically an expert in them.  The designers say they sacrificed realism for playability with this approach, but this is a cop-out.  It took me five minute to revise the skill system to provide both. <br /> <br />My second complaint is that the book provides relatively little information on the non-human races.  This was most likely a space issue which will be amended in future supplements.  It begs the question though; why include the non-human races if they could be fully developed?  As a referee I will need to develop these non-human cultures, only to see my work become outdated when said supplements are published. <br /> <br />Despite these complaints, I was very impressed with \\"Blue Rose.\\"     It dispenses with the outdated elements of the d20 system, which I heartily applaud.  More than that though, it inspires players to take their playing in a new direction, and in a hobby that is bogged down with endless repitions of a small pool of cliches this approach is truly noteworthy.	2005-03-01
US	51756719	R3GT41NBBZWPJR	1556341849	433027969	GURPS Fantasy Bestiary reprint (GURPS: Generic Universal Role Playing System)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	I liked it!	Previous viewers have noted that \\"GURPS Fantasy Bestiary\\" was nothing like TSR's monster manual, i.e. it does not include fantasy races like goblins and minotaurs, and it doesn't include made-for-gaming creatures like beholders.  Instead, it presents samplings from various mythological traditions (European, Chinease, even rural America).  Unlike previous viewers, I applaud this approach heartily.  The fantasy races were best covered in another book where their uniqueness could receive the proper attention, and most made-for-gaming monsters are agonizingly lame.  Any of you AD&D players remember the Flumph?  My point exactly. <br /> <br />With this book, players can go toe-to-toe with creatures that have a solid mythological history, but are not necessarily so cliche that the fight becomes an exercise in dice rolling.  Perhaps your players have heard of the bunyip, but do they know what it can do?  How about the hodag?  The Chon-Chon? <br /> <br />My number one gripe against this book is the large numbers of unique monsters in it, such as Cerebrus and Scylla.  While some of these could be used as guidelines to create breeds of monsters (as is often done with, say, the hydra) others seem to be there just to take up space.  The Scylla of myth was more of a force of nature than a foe to be fought, why give it valuable space in a book of foes to be fought? <br /> <br />Aside from that, this book provided me with considerable food for thought in designing fantasy adventures.  It even includes chapters on monstrous plants and dragons (although the latter may be outdated with the publishing of GURPS Dragons).  I recommend it to any GURPS fantasy GM.	2004-08-19

Of those who have heard of him, most know of him from second and third hand accounts that label him a quack.  &quot;Listen Little Man&quot; stands apart from most of his works in that it is not, specifically, about his theories.  Rather it is about his observations of the world and the people who make live in it.<br />Much had been said about Reich's tendencies to be opinionated, excitable and at times tactless.  A sense of this comes across in &quot;Listen Lettle Man.&quot;  The writing style is not (and is not intended to be) soft-handed.  This does NOT, however, invalidate his message.<br />The book speaks to the everyday person, the one who works for a paycheck, comes home and watches the news, helps the kids with their homework and goes to bed day after day as if on automatic, simply because it is what he/she &quot;should&quot; do.  In this book, Reich suggests, demands and at times implores the everyday person to ask &quot;why.&quot;  Why do you give up your dreams for a life of miserable &quot;security?&quot;  Why do you look to political ideologies to set you &quot;free?&quot;  Why do you find relief in others' pain when you watch or listen to the &quot;news?&quot;  If you have never asked yourself these questions, you need to read this book!<br />Note that although Reich's voice in this book tends to be harsh he does not speak out of contempt or disgust.  He emphasizes that being happy is the right of everyone, but you can never achieve happiness if your life is run on automatic.  Note also that he makes frequent reference to &quot;contemporary&quot; issues like the first world war and the Russian revolution.  Don't let that fool you into thinking that his messgae is dated.  If anything, in this age of sound bites, fads and disposable pop-psychology, his message is more relevent than ever.<br />Thank you for reading my review	2004-06-30

It was a superhero RPG supported by some excellent supervillian-related supplements.  I expected \\"Crooks\\" to be as good, but was sorely disappointed.<br />My first peeve is that several of the villians contained in \\"Crooks\\" were reprinted from the M&M basic rule book.  Apparently the authors were pressed for ideas, and assumed we would not mind paying for reprinted material.  Second, several of the villians repeat themes.  For example there are three, count 'em, three villians with a nazi/racist theme.  This shows a lack of imagination, and frankly it takes more than being politically incorrect to be a decent villian.  Third, the sad fact is that many of the villians herein are just plain lame.  For example there is \\"Miss Martian\\" an alien/movie star/mind controller.  Yeah, I'm shakin' in my cape and cowl.<br />This isn't to say that the book is worthless though.  Several of the villians are quite intriguing.  I personally was drawn to the \\"The Clique\\", a team of \\"fashionable femme felons\\" who were clearly inspired by anime.  In addition, the book provides pages of mooks for heroes to wade through in battle.  Not just various types of humans, ranging from thugs, to terrorists to ninja to cultists.  It also contains zombies, stock demons, combots and other flavors of cannon fodder.  There are also templates for designing werewolves and vampires.  Finally, there are several new feats (mostly intended for villians, such as \\"diplomatic immunity\\") which promise to add fun to your game.<br />In conclusion, \\"Crooks\\" isn't a bad supplement, it just isn't a great one.  I recommend trying to get it second hand at a discount.	2004-06-16

Since the beginning, role playing games have been primarily about one thing; wish fulfillment.  Basically it's about people becoming what they could never really be, doing what they could never really do, and reaping rewards they could never really have.  The horror RPG genre turns this dynamic on its head, generally casting the heroes as normal folk facing odds they cannot overcome with brute force.  \\"Little Fears\\" takes this one step further.  Here the players are facing overwhelming odds, but they don't even have the strength or influence of a grown-up to face them with!  Power-gamers will turn up their noses at such a prospect, but for those of us who truly enjoy a role-playing challenge \\"Little Fears\\" is a must-get.<br />The premise is that all the nightmares of childhood; the Boogeyman, the monster-in-the-closet, monsters from the movies and a host of other villians that children can't even conceive of but their parents have been conditioned by sensationalist media to dread, all live in a parellel world called \\"Closetland.\\"  The monsters of Closetland seek to steal children's innocence and sanity, and whenever possible the children as well.  Adults, having grown out of innocence cannot perceive the creatures of Closetland, so the children are on their own to protect themselves from these menaces.<br />The system uses only six-sided dice.  The characters have five primary stats; muscle, feet, smarts, hands and spirit.  Game play revolves around using a single die to either roll under a stat for success (i.e. a \\"quiz\\") or rolling over an opponent's stat when an action is opposed (i.e. a \\"test\\").  The author gives descriptions for some monsters, particularly the \\"leaders.\\"  Details about what the \\"rank-and-file\\" monsters are like and what they can do are vague.  This allows the GM to create customized creatures that only s/he knows about.  Any GM who has been frustrated by \\"Call of Cthulhu\\" players who just happen to own a copy of the rulebook will appreciate this, although it does mean a lot of work.<br />Overlaying the premise of supernatural monsters stalking children, is the very real threat of child abduction.  Although it is billed as the game of \\"childhood terror,\\" the author often blurs the distinction between the fears of children and the fears of their parents.  Thus the rules contain references to eating disorders, cannibalism and other scenes of horror that some readers may find difficult to read, and even harder to place in a workable game.  Only the most mature of players, for example, should even consider writing a scenerio involving the \\"king of lust,\\" whom, the rules describe in chilling detail.  As a result, even some fans of horror gaming may be tempted to avoid \\"Little Fears\\" as being just too much to take.<br />Again, I thoroughly enjoyed reading and playing \\"Little Fears.\\"  Its unique premise makes it a powerful and compelling break from other games.  But even as a devoted fan I cannot play it too often, and do not begrudge those who would not play it at all.  \\"Little Fears\\" is a five star game, but it is not for everyone.	2004-05-15

Then welcome to Story Engine, a bare bones, streamlined generic system.  <br />The systems is built around 6 sided dice, yes, just one kind of die!  There are 4 stats; Matter (for physical trials) Mind (mental), Spirit (willpower) and Chaos (luck).  To create a character the player spends story points to create descriptors under each stat.  For4 example, you could spend some points and make your character &quot;strong&quot; (Matter) some more to make him &quot;Handsome&quot; (Matter again) and then maybe a few more to say &quot;Things tend to go his way&quot; (Chaos).  But the descriptors aren't merely window dressing.  During the game the player can &quot;burn&quot; a descrptior for a bonus on the trial check.  The above character could say, &quot;I'm so 'strong' I should win this battle&quot; burning the &quot;strong&quot; descriptor for that gaming session and thus claim the bonus.<br />In addition to the stats the players can develop abilities (basically skills, your level of experience with each skill determine s your bonus on checks) and special features, the nature of whcih depend on the campaign.  In a hard-science espionage campagin a special abilitiy might be &quot;Very Likeable.&quot;  In a supoerheroes campaign, it might be flight or x-ray vision.<br />There are only two things that might bring this system down in some people's eyes.  First, as stated, the game is minimalist, all trials are resolved by a single die roll.  For people who enjoy long, drawn out battles and still think it's cool to keep track of &quot;hit points&quot; this can be a problem.  Second, unlike GURPS there is little to no support material, which means the GM will have to do a lot of work to set up a campaign.  If you don;t mind this though, &quot;Story Engine&quot; provides one of the best generic gaming systems available.	2004-03-30

Yes this book does describe the origins of Scraps, the patchwork girl, who goes on to become a regular fixture in future Oz stories.  However she is, in fact, a secondary character in the story.  The main character is Ojo \\"the unlucky,\\" a Munchkin boy who embarks on a quest to save his beloved uncle who has been accidentally turned into a marble statue.<br />This book offers the usual assortment of pleasantly odd characters, strange magical happenings and dramtic tension that go into all of the good Oz novels.  What makes \\"Patchwork Girl...\\" stand out is its reltively mature subplot of the importance of rules.  Ozma has made it illegal for most people to use magic.  The crooked magician ignores this rule, and as an indirect result two innocent people are turned into marble.  One of the items Ojo must get for his quest is illegal to gather.  He doesn't want to break the law, but restoring his uncle is the most important thing to him, so he justifies it to himself.  Then, the reader is introduced to the humane way Oz deals with people who break the rules.  This theme will speak volumes to any child who has chaffed under the rules of an adult, but secretly acknowledged that the adult had his or her best interests at heart.<br />Several reviewers have commented that the end of the book is a cop out, and yes it might be disappointing if you were expecting a big, dramatic magical event.  In truth, however, it is a masterful conclusion to the rules subplot.  The conclusion underscores that rules are made to be kept, and that breaking them and then trying to sneakily get around them only causes problems.  If one admits to breaking the rules, as the crooked magician should have done, and then tries to correct the mistake, it often avoids a great deal of trouble and ultimately works out better.<br />Overall, this book is a great read for young and old alike.	2003-12-24

He and Charley, well, travel.  That's it.  Along the way there are plenty of things for him to offer opinions of, mostly negative.  One gets the feeling that Steinbeck is out looking for more pathetic people to exploit, er, uh, I mean downtrodden subcultures to champion.  But in the end, it is clear that Steinbeck concludes that the America of 1962 wasn't such a bad place.  Gee, thanks Mr. Steinbeck, hey eveybody, we can get on with our lives, John Steinbeck thinks we're okay!<br />Overall \\"Travels...\\" reads like a supreme testament to Steinbeck's ego.  One can almost hear him saying, \\"My opinion of this truck is 100% relavent, I am, after all, John Steinbeck.\\"  What's more, it is a \\"personal experience\\" and nothing dates faster than a \\"personal experience.\\"  I can see how in 1962 rambling around the country offering sporadic opinions might have been the height of literature (it was right in between \\"On The Road\\" and \\"Easy Rider\\") but America has changed a bit in the past 40 years.  So why is this book still in print?  Apparently, because it was written by John Steinbeck.  Although this vidicates his superhuman ego, it does make one grateful that Steinbeck's publisher did not get a hold of his grocery list.  Otherwise we would be subjected to \\"Truffles with Chutney; The John Steinbeck Diet.\\"	2003-06-20

Mr. Lester's Uncle Remus is undefined, a narrator who lends a clear and distinctive voice to the stories, yet is never identified or described, unlike the elderly ex-slave of the Harris tellings.  This was done so the reader could develop his or her own ideas of just who the new Uncle Remus is.  Second, Mr. Lester unabashedly uses modern language and references (like shopping malls and the like).  There are those who would say that by doing so Mr. Lester is ruining the Uncle Remus stories.  However, Mr. Lester makes it very clear that his intent was not to ruin the stories, but to save them.<br />This assertion is underscored by the fact that although the language of the book is modern, the stories themselves are largely untouched.  Mr. Lester does not present us with the Disney version of Brer Rabbit; a likeable character who serves the role of passive protagonist.  Mr. Lester's Brer Rabbit, like Harris' Brer Rabbit, is an unrepentent troublemaker whose cleverness does more than lift him out of jams.  He steals, lies, stirs up conflict and on a few occasions, commits murder.  In that sense, despite the updated language, Mr. Lester's versions are far closer to the source material than most authors who retell the Uncle Remus stories.<br />I take nothing away from the works of Harris.  For those who wish to read the original works in the original dialect and accept them as products of the age in which they were written, then the books are an excellent read.  Unfortunately, most modern readers will not want to struggle with the dialect or accept Uncle Remus' congenial attitude towards his own enslavement.  In that case, only scholars would read them and the stories would fall into obscurity.  I for one praise Mr. Lester's efforts to keep the Uncle Remus stories alive and relevent.  Yes, some changes were made, but don't forget, the stories were also changed when they were imported from Africa	2003-05-22

His page, Bartholmew, tries to enlighten the king with simple common sense. The king ignores him and turns to (literally) magical solutions for his current peeve. When the results turn disastrous, Barthlomew tries to warn his friends in the castle. No one listens to him, being more concerned with their own business and as a result, they all end up worse off. Then, when the king finally listens to him, a ray of hope appears amidst the crisis. <br />Written in 1949, \\"Batholomew and the Oobleck\\", like its prequel, \\"The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins\\" hardly feels like a Dr. Suess book. The illustrations look like charcoal sketches (except of course for the green oobleck) and the text lacks the sing-song poetry commonly associated with Suess books. Despite this, the Bartholomew books have withstood the tests of time and tastes because they touch on a subject that is near to the hearts of all children, but which is rarely addressed in children's literature. Many times children find themselves surrounded by adults hurrying about, fixated on their own agendas. When a child is in the thick of such a situation, he or she will often be ignored. After all, why should adults listen to children? BATO tells us why; children can sometimes see situations as clearly or moreso than adults specifically because they are not distracted by adult agendas! The lesson of BATO stands for all generations, and that is what makes it a timeless classic.	2003-05-09

As a psychologist who has spent two years leading domestic violence abatement groups, I must disagree with much of what Dr. Dutton reports in his book. He describes batterers as full of self-loathing, yet in two years I have never met one who remotely fit that description. Most of them seemed ashamed of their actions, but consoled themselves by saying the abuse was an isolated incident. The rest denied that they had done anything wrong while simultaneously and smugly declaring that their abuse was justified, and that the only reason they were convicted was because the system is corrupt and they weren't adequately defended in court. If that sounds like typical criminal thought processes, well, it is.<br />Dr. Dutton falls into the same trap that the courts do when they refer all batterers carte-blanche to treatment. They assume that chronic batterers are somehow different from other violent offenders simply because their chosen victim is someone they supposedly love. They ignore a very simple fact that applies to all forms of criminal behavior; many criminals enjoy what they do and feel no \\"self-loathing\\" at all. Treating such criminals as if they are sick and need treatment only emboldens them further.<br />Dr. Dutton's recommendations for treatment are particuarly niave. He recommends asking the participants in the group about their abusive behavior during the previous week. This is akin to asking a chronic thief if he has stolen anything recently; it puts them on their defensive high-horse, regardless of the objective truth. In addition it makes the asker look like a fool for expecting to get anything other than the \\"right\\" answer.<br />Dr. Dutton also recommends regular contact with the abuser's partner. This is not only foolish, but dangerous. If questionnaires are sent to the partner, make no mistake that the abuser will be filling them out. If the partner is interviewed with the abuser you will only hear what the abuser wants you to hear. If you interview thepartner alone the abuser is likely to hit her to make her tell him what she said, hit her again to get what she \\"really\\" said, then hit her again to make sure she doesn't forget.<br />The book gets two stars because Dr. Dutton does acknolwedge that not all men who hit are chronic batterers. In addition, he wisely rejects neurological hypotheses that remove responsibility from the abuser. However, no progress can be made in the field of batterer treatment until therapists and the courts start acknolwedging chronic batterers as the criminals they are. The \\"you need treatment, you don't belong in jail\\" approach is ineffective because that is what criminals themselves believe.	2003-05-06

The first chapter in which Ephalba, the mysterious witch-to-be, is born in Munchkinland captivated me. We then jump to when Elphaba goes to college, and the \\"plot\\" takes a jump into the garbage.  Ephalba proves to be difficult to like, a self-absorbed boor who revels in her role as \\"outcast\\" and assumes a superior attitude over it.  Along the way we are intoduced to Glinda, an irritating snob, Boq, a pathetic fool in love with Glinda who inexplicably becomes friends with Elphaba, and a host of other unlikable characters.  The college chapter also includes simplistic diatribes against animal experimentation, trivializing a serious, complicated, real world issue.<br />After that, things seem to happen for no other reason than the fact that they need to happen for the sake of the story.  Elphaba moves in with the princess of Winkie-land.  Why does she let her stay?  So Elphaba can be the witch of the West of course.  How nice of the princess to act irrationally for the sake of MacGuire's story.  Elphaba begins sewing wings onto snow monkeys.  Why does a rabid animal rights activist maim helpless monkeys?  Because it moves the plot along.  Glinda later becomes the witch of the North.  Now, previously MacGuire had painstakingly been working every bit character from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" into his story.  Now he makes Glinda the witch of the North, like in the movie, ignoring the fact that in the book she was the witch of the South.  Why does he do this?  Because it moves the plot along.<br />The overall message seems to be MaGuire whining, \\"She's not bad, just misunderstood.\\" As in most cases where people try to defend criminal behavior thisway, this line of \\"reasoning\\" falls flat. What is truly unforgivable, however, is that I found I really didn't care if she was evil, misunderstood, or anything else. I was just waitng for the bucket of water to fly so the story could end and I could return to my life. Overall, \\"Wicked\\" offers a promising premise, but fails to carry it out.	2003-03-01

Mutants and Masterminds is a game which applies the d20 system to the superhero genre.  In creating M&amp;M the publishers have taken the system and improved it by eliminating the antiquated elements which were keeping the d20 system in the dark ages.  That's right, M&amp;M has no stifeling character classes, no meaningless alignments and, best of all, NO HIT POINTS!  That fact alone makes it worth at least 4 stars in my opinion.<br />I have played most of the superhero games which have been published, including the Marvel and DC games, Villians and Vigillantes, Underground and Champions.  The streamlined but playable rules of M&amp;M beat all of them.  The rules for powers are highly customizable, allowing players to design the character they want to play.  In addition, the rules for gadgets, skills and feats can make a character who doesn't have powers (like, The Punisher from the comics) fun and worth playing.  The fact that &quot;supernormals&quot; don't have muich of a chnace was one of my biggest gripes against some other systems, and a big point in M&amp;M's favor for me.<br />Overall M&amp;M gets my highest recommendations.	2003-02-07

Books	3	3	4	N	N	For completists only	The essays which make up the book \\"Satan Speaks\\" were written by Anton Szandor LaVey as his life drew to a close.  His life would be considered exhausting by any standard, and in reading \\"Satan Speaks\\" his fatigue was apparent.  Gone is the revolutionary spirit that went into \\"The Satanic Bible\\" and, to a  slightly lesser degree, \\"The Devil's Notebook.\\"  It is largely replaced by crabbiness and an almost pathetic attempt at justifying his existence.  For example, in the essay, \\"My Enemy\\" LaVey bemoans the fact that he can no longer by an ice cream cone for a nickle because of other people's greed.  Where is the LaVey who called greed a Satanic virtue?  Other essays seem to be aimed at puffing himself up as THE figure of evil.  In a list of self-quotes he applauds himself for being the only person to codify Satanic thought.  Was he expecting thanks for doing so doing so?  Wasn't vain and empty  self-promotion one of the things he heckled the Christian church for?<br />Despite this, \\"Satan Speaks\\" does offer some excellent essays.  One essay on invisibility gives a free lesson in practical magic.  Another titled \\"Sleepers, Scarcity and Orphans\\" articulately champions the cause of maintaining individual identity against the forces of mediocrity.  In short, this isn't a bad book, but it is an inconsistent one.  If one is simply curious about the founder of the church of Satan, I recommend \\"The Devil's Notebook.\\"  For serious students there is \\"The Satanic Bible.\\"  I can only recommend \\"Satan Speaks\\" to those who feel the need to read everything LaVey wrote.	2003-02-02

It centers on a rooster named \\"Chauntecleer\\" who's life revolves around keeping his coop in line.  He is somewhat arrogant and pompous, but he takes his duty seriously, and his concern for the hens he \\"governs\\" is obvious.  He is assisted by a masochistic dog whos presence provides humor while simultaneously invoking a deep sense of sympathy.  Another rooster gives in to vanity and unwittingly looses the ultimate evil of the world.  Chauntecleer and his allies must stop this evil, or the world is lost.<br />This brief synopsis does not even begin to do the book justice.  The characters are vibrant and vivid.  the story is engrossing, and even the most jaded fan will find the plot twists and imagery  irrisitable.  All I can say is read this book, you will not be disappointed.	2003-01-17

The reviews likening George's story to the African slave trade are particularly puzzling: children do not think in those terms.  I suggest that the folks who complain that it glorifies illegal animal trade read it more closely.  George makes a lot of innocent mistakes, he doesn't mean to be bad, but the world is too fascinating for him to resist.  He needs to have an authority figure looking out for him, and although he does try to get around the authority figure everyone knows the man with the yellow hat will save George from himself in the end.  Yes, George is a monkey, but he is also a metophor for children everywhere.  Every child in the world can relate to George, and that is why the books have remained popular for so long.<br />I loved Curious George as a child, and I am happy that my children love them as much as I do.  If any book in the 4-8 age bracket deserves 5 stars it is Curious George.	2003-01-12

It seems somehow different from the others in numerous ways.  Humor was prominent in many of the books, but in this book the humor was somewhat subdued.  Also, the sense of danger and menace was quite profound, from Dorothy's initial shipwreck to being chased by the Wheelers to the battle of wits with the Nome King.  The Nome King, incidentally, is protrayed as cunnning and (for the most part) subdued.  This makes his presence as the villian very intriguing, much moreso (in my opinion) than when he is protrayed as a bellowing buffoon (as in book 8).  <br />Other enjoyable elements are the introduction of the fiesty and clever Billina (my favorite Oz character), and the enchantment of  the major characters by the Nome King.  In later books Ozma is an almost god-like figure who seems unscathable, and often acts as a deux ex machina.  In this book, however, we see her in a moment of rare vulnerability, whic makes her much more interesting in my opinion.<br />I found all of Baum's Oz books to be enjoyable in some way, but the drama and tension of \\"Ozma of Oz\\" was never quite matched, and it remains my favorite of the series.	2002-12-29
US	51756719	R3VP30NQEFERYQ	0345334671	585088193	Road to Oz (Wonderful Oz Books)	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Weakest of the series, but still enjoyable	Everyone has their favorite Oz novel, but of the 14 which Baum wrote, this one is, in my opinion, the weakest.  Unlike other Oz books there is little in the way of plot.  This makes reading it uncomfortable as the reader spends most of the book waiting for somehting to happen, only to realize at the end that nothing happened.  Also, I loved the tense yet humorus situations Baum masterfully set up in the other books. I rorared with laughter in the second book when Jelia Jamb &quot;translated&quot; for the scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead.  The trial from book four and Dorothy's capture by the people of Utensia in book six also made me laugh while also clutching the book with fascination.  There are no comperable scenes in &quot;Road to Oz&quot; and this is sorely missed.<br />However, the book is still worth reading.  For one thing it introduces the Shaggy Man, who proves to be a most enjoyable character.  The Shaggy Man carries a device called the love magnet, which causes people who see it to love him.  This subplot introduces a very mature and though-provoking conflict.  Is it right to enchant people into loving?  Is this a power that one person, even a well-intentioned one, can hold alone?  What are the drawbacks of being loved by everyone?  This subplot held my interest and made the story readable.<br />Finally, there are cameo appearances in the end from many of Baum's non-Oz books.  Clearly these appearances are a plug for his other works.  One cannot fault him too much for doing this though.  Baum wrote many fine books which had nothing to do with Oz, and this needs to be remembered.<br />Despite this book's weakness, it did not signal the decline of the series.  Most of the later books were quite good, and I found &quot;The Tin Woodsman of Oz&quot; (number 12) to be one of the best.  Keep  reading, as altogether there is nothing like the Oz series.	2002-12-29
US	51756719	R215IS807I4B4A	1556074433	436041756	Salt Of The Earth	Books	2	11	69	N	N	Historical value only	Much has been made of the courage and heart that went into the making of &quot;Salt of the Earth.&quot;  After considering these facts, modern viewers are left to wonder how well the movie has held up over the years.  Sad to say, it hasn't.  First of all, the production values of the film are extremely poor.  The cinematography is washed out and grainy, and the dialogue is laugh-out-loud melodramatic.  Fans will say that this is because the film was under fire from the beginning, and perhaps the cinematography, painful as it is to watch, can be forgiven.  The script cannot, however, as it is blatantly clear that the writer was more intersted in getting his message across than giving the audience a well paced story.  While this style of writing may inspire people already committed to the writer's cause, it will alienate the undecided who came expecting a decent movie.  Thus writing for melodrama hurts the cause more than it helps it.  &quot;Salt...&quot; suffers further when it is held next to movies like Enrice's &quot;Spirit of the Beehive.&quot;  The latter film was also made under the spectre of censorship, but its production values are excellent, proving that a truly talented director can produce a good quality movie and get a message across despite adverse conditions.  Even if one forgives these facts, however, the film still fails modern audiences because of its datedness.  Although modern social activitsts are loathe to admit it, the American labor movement has progressed greatly over the last 50 years.  A White, college student activist who sees this film and is inspired to search the southwest looking for oppressed towns to liberate is likely to be very disappointed, as wage gaurantees, working hour caps, overtime laws, group health plans and spanish speaking lawyers who specialize in labor law have changed the scene dramatically since 1954.  In short, although &quot;Salt...&quot; deserves a modicum of recognition for the bravery of its very existence, thefilm's only real value is as a historical curiosity and a rallying call to radical activists who cannot see that the era of the film has long since passed.	2002-03-19

In other words, it is not a statement of the quality or relavence of a book, but rather it is applied because some one long ago said \\"This is a classic!\\" and no one has dared to say otherwise.From the outset it is difficult to understand why \\"Death...\\" was written.  It may have been to help Gunther deal with his grief.  In that sense the book's maudlin, endless droning of, \\"my poor son is gonna die\\" makes Gunther seem like a boo-hooing guest on Oprah who is grabbing at 15 minutes of fame by belaboring their pain.  If the book is a tribute to his son it fails because Gunther's description of him makes him sound superhuman.  The boy is an athlete, a musician, excells in every school subject, is loved by everyone who meets him and is always optimistic.  For cryin' out loud, why didn't the boy just operate on himself and remove the tumor?  Nothing seems to be beyond him after all.  There is no way a reader can relate to the plight of this supposed prodigy.  If the book is to provide inspiration for other families dealing with a fataly ill child it fails in this regard too.  Gunther and his wife keep the worst news of their son's condition a secret from him (of course the boy was such a genius he probably did his own medical tests and found out how bad it was).  This suggests that Gunther feels deceiving your children about their condition is not only right, it is laudable.  In my opinion, children have a right to know these things, and Gunther's stance is, in my eyes, abominable!  In summary, \\"Death...\\" belongs with other supposed classics like \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" and \\"The Faerie Queen,\\" gathering dust on the shelves of literature professors where their inertia can fade away into the shadows of books that actually inspire and enlighten.	2002-03-15

They are my favorite Suess books, however, as they speak to any child who is frustrated and put upon by adults who talk down to them.  The theme of The 500 Hats... is as relevant, if not more so, than it was when the book was originally published.<br />The magically re-appearing hats is frustrating to bartholomew, but to the adults around him it is a terrifying and disturbing thing, not because it is dangerous but because it threatens their sense of what should be.  The interventions they try range from the simple (calling in &quot;experts&quot; like a tailor, wise men and magicians) to the desperate and frightening (ordering Bartholomew's head and the offending hats cut off).  Throughout it all, bartholomew's desires and needs are forgotten, and he is looked upon merely as an extension of this &quot;problem.&quot;  Also involved is the king's nephew, a &quot;normal&quot; child who spearheads the movement to do away with Bartholomew, not out of fear or concern but out of simple spite.  In the end, however, the magic and wonder of the event is recognized and celebrated rather than condemed.<br />I would particualrly recommend this book to parents of children with learning disorders.  The themes descibed above would be particularly familiar, and the conclusion especially satisfying. The grim sections of the book (such as when the king orders bartholomew's execution) should not scare anyone off from what is a wonderful and inspiring story.	2001-10-02

These fun stories, told in first person for added effect, carry the elements that has made American tall tales a unique literary genre (i.e., a mundane setting made extraordinary, the wild exaggerations told in all seriousness, vague references to others who can substantiate the story).  This McBroom book was my favorite, because it describes some classic animals from American &quot;whoppers.&quot;  My highest reccomendations overall.	2001-06-11

Granted the venerable game has become synonamous with role-playing, but the hobby has advanced tremendously since the 70's, and even this edition of D&amp;D fails to reflect this.  The new edition has a good system of character skills, and the new method of handling die rolls, particularly combat, is relatively streamlined and free of charts, which is always welcome.  However, the major flaws of D&amp;D are still there.  It still relies on character classes (resulting in ho-hum generic characters), it still uses hit points (so after a few adventrues your characters will be wading through armies of orcs without a scratch looking for gods to kill), and it retains the numbers-heavy interest-light 3-18 scale for attributes.  There are many good fantasy games on the market now, so if you are looking to make an investment for reasons beyond nostalgia, I recommend looking elsewhere.	2001-02-09

Thus, the game is overloaded with bizarre collections of numbers that seem to have no place in the world.  Does a game really need orcs, goblins, hobgolblins, bugbears, kobolds and gnolls?  It would seem the world is painfully overpopulated, even with all the dragons, bullette, catoblepas, etc. around to devour the excess.  The new monster manual is crammed with vague, half formed ideas, many of which border on silliness.  Many monsters from earlier editions were excluded, and there is no information on translating them to the new system. I would have much preferred fewer monsters with greater detail given to each one, with suggestions for DM's to create their own beasts.  One good point is that the publishers have returned to talking about &quot;demons&quot; and &quot;devils&quot; with regards to evil otherworldly beings.  The second edition concepts in this regard made no sense, and the change from the 1st edition seemed aimed at people who wouldn't have played the game anyway.	2001-02-09

Perhaps she hoped it would open my eyes to &quot;the people's glorious revolution.&quot;  In fact, it confirmed in my mind that communists are seriously deluded people.  The writers in this book lament their rejection by middle class Americans, seemingly oblivious to the fact that one of the major tenants of communism is the violent destruction of the middle class (I say &quot;violent&quot; because I doubt the middle class would simply relinquish its status when &quot;the glorious revolution occurs).  They also bemoan that their first ammendment rights were ignored.  The first ammendment was wirtten to allow speech to improve the system.  No nation has ever or will ever tolerate speech advocating the destruction of itself and the massacre of its citizens.  They should get used to it anyway, as whenever a communist regime takes hold the first thing it does is eliminate free speech.  Overall, this book is a worthless collection of narcissistic, revolutionary ramblings, myopic pseudo-history and whining, with no real educational merit at all.	2001-02-07
