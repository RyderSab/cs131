This book was a quick grab at an airport terminal on a delayed flight.  Throughout, she decries people called 'liberals' as the reason there are problems in the world...  But, Coulter says the US is infiltrated by a massive, secret army with a defined anti-good agenda that does everything it can to bring the country down.<br />...In any case, Coulter writes down to her audience, since I can't believe anyone with the intelligence to get a law degree can see the world in such a simplistic way...<br />...Also, Coulter's views on race issues in this country are hilariously skewed.  Anyone who says the days of racial inequality are dead and gone has never set foot in an average town in America.  Racism is still alive and well, and, despite the progress being made on both sides of the color line, will be for many more years.<br /><br />Dividing millions of Americans into two camps - evil liberals and God-chosen conservatives, is an assault on the intelligence of anyone with the brains to read books.  It also makes it difficult to have intelligent discussions about government in this country without resorting to babyish name-calling and partisanship.<br /><br />I guess this book was simply a drive at political comedy, since I can't believe the author took her own rhetoric seriously.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins	2003-02-19

Cheapens the reality of Christ.	I picked this book up off the street.  Literally, off the street.  I've always thought it was a crime to throw away books, no matter how old, so I saved this one.  The cover was ripped off, but the intro was still there.  I couldn't believe I was reading a book about a gay man turned straight through belief in Christ.  This was one of the worst things I've ever heard of.<br /><br />This is an easy read, as it's one of those celebrity autobiographies written with the 'help' of a real author.  It's pretty sad that Paulk attributed his unhappiness in life to his sexuality, and never analyzed his orientation through his own wants and needs, and not through the perspective of someone else.  Unfortunately, God and Jesus don't want you to be soemthing you're not.  And while you can convert to Christianity, there is no way to convert the sexuality with which you were born.  It can be a struggle to define and come to terms with your true nature, and the strength you gain from religion can help you in this quest, but accepting the love of God will not reverse your sexual polarity if you're gay.  God's love can give you the strength to discover your true self, but it will not make you straight if you're gay.  You can cover it up, you can pretend, and you can deny it, but the truth is a person's true sexual tastes are designed from birth, whether they lay in brain or spirit makes little difference.<br /><br />In John's own words: \\"Growing up, I heard it all...sissy, queer, fag. Naturally, I believed I was born gay.\\"  Perhaps he was.  Most people have an idea of their orientation before they have a practical knowledge of sexual attraction.  Perhaps if we lived in a culture in which people were accepted regardless of their tastes, John would never have been tormented like that.<br /><br />John was a gay drag queen and sometimes prostitute.  In his book, he says that the queer identity drove him into depression and drug abuse, and that he was not relieved of these symptoms until he became straight.  So, John was a depressed queer who was really straight.  It can take years to understand your own sexual identity, and if John is happy as a straight man, then I'm all for him.  But what he repeats in his book is that gay men and women who are unhappy can and should be converted to heterosexuality through Christianity.<br /><br />Well, I'm glad John found his true calling in life, but the fact is most homos are stable people who are happy with their sexuality and wish people would just accept the way they are.  Just like straights, queers have a wide variety of personalities.  Not every gay guy is a drag queen prostitute, in fact most of them are straight-wristed and deep of voice, and they're attracted to other men.  Before we start looking for the 'cure' for this, perhaps we should ask why it's wrong?<br /><br />It's great John found what makes him happy sexually, but this book basically says the answer to a gay person's lifestyle is for them to accept Jesus and turn straight through his love.  This does so much disservice to Christ, and gay people, that I almost couldn't finish this book.  For one, it turns gay people who have no interest in 'turning' off from Christ's love.  They end up seeing Jesus used as an anti-gay device, when in fact Jesus loves everyone regardless of their orientation, and isn't worried in the slightest about those who are attracted to the same sex.<br /><br />Also, this book's message is downright harmful to gays who are indesicive or depressed about their lifestyle, in that it attempts to convince them that they can change if they believe.  Devotion to Christ will not change your identity.  You can only reveal your own identity through hard work and deliberation.  There have likely been more gay suicides because of the fact that they couldn't change than there were gay conversions through Christ.  Convincing someone that their sexuality is a personal sin and that they can change if they only truly believe is dangerous.  Because of this, I can't support the views in this book.  If anything, John Paulk should support people to try understand their sexuality, whether straight or gay, and come to terms with it in healthy ways.truly believe is dangerous.  Because of this, I can't support the views in this book.  If anything, John Paulk should support people to try understand their sexuality, whether straight or gay, and come to terms with it in healthy ways.	2003-02-01

Growing up in the woods of antebellum Wisconsin, Ingalls recalls the details, both big and small, of settler life.  The world is much different today than it was back then, and this book displays that perfectly.  The Ingalls' were very self-sufficient people, and had to care for each other in a way that shows how families back then were self-reliant teams, instead of groups of people who see each other for 15 minutes while they have breakfast, an hour after dinner, and then on the weekends.<br /><br />This book teaches kids how people who are poor in wealth can be rich in life.  The Ingalls' had no servants and no silk sheets.  Luxury was hard candy on Christmas.  Hiking into town was tempting fate.  Laura's favorite plaything was a corn-husk doll.  The Ingalls had to make use of every scrap of food and every 1/2 cent they had!  At the same time, they were reverant, intelligent, and caring people.<br /><br />This book is an unbeatable read for kids, and still enjoyable for adults, as well.	2003-01-25

This book does not do that to a great degree.<br /><br />The fact that humans undergo genetic evolution due to climate and geography is undeniable.  The results are as clear as day.  What is not as clear is day is the fact that an IQ test, no matter how well-designed, is unable to account for the individual interpretation to questions by test takers.<br /><br />Also, there are innumerable genetic types and sub-types of humans.  The term African-American is somewhat of a mysnomer, since there is a huge variety of genotypes in the continent itself.  Most of the slaves that came to the US were from the West Coast, but they don't exactly resemble the people from that area.  Any black in America who's had ancestors here for more than three generations is most likely a genetic mixing pot, and are likely to have at least some white ancenstry.<br /><br />If you look in areas of Europe that were traditionally economic and social underdogs, you will see high rates of disease, crime, and poverty.  This is true whether you're talking about Ireland or Albania.  When the Irish immigrated to America en masse in the 19th century, they were heavily discriminated against because they brought crime and poverty with them.  This is well-documented and plenty of proof is left in the form of anti-Irish signs and warnings, and anti-Irish essays by distinguished scholars.  However, the Irish interbred with other whites and within a few generations Irish discrimination was forgotten.  The same thing will happen in this country with blacks, hispanics, etc., once people evolve mentally to the point that they realize race doesn't matter.<br /><br />From my own observations in life, there is no difference in human intelligence between the races.  There are superior ideas, and from these ideas, superior cultures and philosophies, but there are no superior races.  Each race in one way or another has added greatly to the sum of human advancement.  How long would it have taken Europeans to develop their own writing and mathematical systems?  If they hadn't been developed by other races that are argued in this book as being intellectually inferior in the modern day, we might still be living by the sun during the day and by fire at night.  Considering the length of human history, another 5,000 years in the dark before someone figures out how to write symbols would be a drop in the bucket.<br /><br />You can argue with numbers and testing all day to determine which races are capable where, but this doesn't replace the invaluable insight given by actually meeting the people you're describing, and assessing through your own experiences who has what strengths.  So far in my life I can't honestly say I recognize race-specific abilities.  Even the argument that blacks dominate professional sports doesn't fly, because guess where the whites that play basketball are coming from?  They're coming from impoverished parts of Europe, namely the Balkans.  It could be that sports is a traditional way for blacks to advance in society, and that life under stressful social conditions is a good forge for developing the drive and ability to succeed in those arenas.<br /><br />A study to discover how genetics determine your physical and mental abilities probably cannot take place on the natural world, since the subjects' nurture will always taint the results.  An important part of the scientific method is to isolate the study to an environment in which the subject is self-contained.  The only way to do this would be to conduct the study in a laboratory-like setting, like a deserted island on which the inhabitants can grow from infants to adults in a setting void of economic and social variables, supervised by scientists who apply quality control to the upbringing of the subjects.  The results of this study would be quite interesting, andprobably a lot more accurate than any using data from real life.<br /><br />-- JJ Timminsquite interesting, and probably a lot more accurate than any using data from real life.<BR><br /><BR>-- JJ Timmins	2003-01-05

However, it fails to convincingly prove or even attempt to describe how life started and expanded into the plethora of plants and animals that now inhabit Earth.  By what natural process did chemicals combine to form even a single living cell?

How did an unconcious accident produce the first photoreceptor?<br /><br />Until these questions are convincingly answered - especially the question of what kicked life off in the first place, the idea that the universe and life within it is the creative product of an unimaginable force or god makes more sense than the theory that it was all random.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins	2002-08-15

Certainly, creationism has been used by various religious and political forces for their own means.

Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History	Books	4	92	96	N	N	Pros and Cons of Military Use	It's somewhat ironic that someone as plain-spoken and hard-headed as Old Gimlet Eye would have a book written about him by an intellectual like Dr. Schmidt, but it says a lot about the relevance of Butler, his life in the Marines and in politics.<br /><br />The book displays how Butler served as both a Marine in endless campaigns for the United States, and how he later came, not to renounce the military or the Marines, but the use of US Military forces overseas as, what he believed them to be, tools of Big Business, and not serving in either the interest of the United States Constitution or its citizens.<br /><br />This book lead me to Butler's own small book &quot;War is a Racket,&quot; which was highly influential in my own opinions about use of military force outside our country's borders.  Butler would never consider himself an intellectual, but he had heaps of common sense - a quality which is sometimes lacking from those with sky-high IQs.  Marines are sworn to the duty of protecting the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and they take this duty to heart.  Once Butler realized that some of his fighting may not have served this interest, he became a very politically charged and controversial figure and speaker.  How the hell could the former Commandant of the United States Marine Corps declare himself against war?  Well, he didn't go against war, but advocated the prudent use of our military strength in the defense of the homeland.  Sometimes he went a little far in supporting his points, but his intentions - to look out for both our country and those who serve it - are admirable traits in any career politician or general (there's little difference between the two once someone picks up that first star).<br /><br />The other things you'll pick up from this book are that Butler was one tough son-of-a-gun.  He's one of the most fearless fighting men this country has ever had.  I hope they kept some DNA from this guy so we can clone him enough times to fill the manpower requirements of at least one Marine Expeditionary Unit.<br /><br />I get the feeling that the author admired Butler's political career more than his military one.  But, he successfully shows how Butler's intellect benefits from civilian life.

I read the book, but found the style a little bit dry.  When I was in the Marines, I noticed my peers and younger troops could barely make it through the book.  While the book's protagonist exemplifies an outstanding soldier and has the qualities all troops - from airmen to Marines - should exemplify, this book isn't ideal for young troops (about 17-22) because most of them will find reading it is more of a task than a joy.<br /><br />On the good side, despite the fact that this is the Napoleanic Era, Dodd's soldierly qualities are as relevant now as they were then.  Just as the army dies on the inside before it's crushed by the outside, so does the individual soldier.  Dodd shows incredible resolve and optimism in his quest to rejoin the unit and give the French hell along the way.<br /><br />I found troops were much more interested in books that were more contemporary with a little more action, like &quot;The Bridge at Dong-Ha.&quot;  This book's protag was real, not fictional, so I think it's even a better read for troops than &quot;Rifleman Dodd.&quot;  There's more action, too.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins	2002-08-08
US	48223452	R15AQUGCR4OFCD	0553244876	536370246	Stuka Pilot	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Unbelievable story..  Too bad he wasn't born in the USA!	The only sad thing about this book is that Rudel, (or his nom-de-guerre, \\"Hannelore\\") fought on the side of the Germans.  Granted, he mostly fought the USSR, but they weren't much better or worse than Nazi Deutsch.  Also, Hannelore was a devout believer in Nazism and the Reich, and expouses his views about fighting the Asian hordes.  It's too bad he wasn't fighting against the Nazis instead of for them.  Having said that, I'll continue the review and concentrate on the story and the man without mention of governments and allegiances.<br /><br />This story is incredibly inspirational and tough.  Hannelore's internal motivation and positive outlook on life in the face of monstrously huge opposition is so huge as to be unworldly.<br /><br />This book should be read by every US servicemember.  It's not 'politically correct,' so it'll never happen, but maybe the government could throw in a disclaimer at the beginning or something at the front about how we're not trying to make our soldiers into Wermacht troops!<br /><br />Hannelore's quote, that \\"Only he is lost who gives himself up for lost,\\" is one of the best maxims I can think of in life.<br /><br />Outstanding inside view of the Luftwaffe, Hitler's high command, and fighting on the Eastern Front.  A dash of humor thrown in with the horror, as well.  This is a great read, one that I'd give to my troops in a heartbeat.  If you're looking for a book to inspire your troops, this is probably more interesting and relevant than \\"Rifleman Dodd,\\" or \\"A letter to Garcia,\\" but a little more controversial due to the allegiance of the protagonist.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins	2002-08-02

It continues the intrigue and high-minded politics of the first book.  It didn't pan to the audience or lose the integrity and grit of the Dune story.

US	48223452	R2NX78W13XB73N	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A triumph.  PS - Readers are the ultimate critics	Frank Hebert wrote Dune, only to be denied by at least twelve publishers before he connected to a publisher of technical manuals, who took a gamble and published Dune.<br /><br />It was panned and trashed by almost all the critics who initially read it.  But the first printing sold out anyway, and the second printing did too.  People were picking up on the quality of this amazing book.  Hebert starting mail from fans describing their fascination with Dune.  Then he got a call from a reporter asking him if he was trying to start a cult.  His answer was \\"God no!\\"<br /><br />It's amazing that this book almost never existed, because this is one of the best books ever written.  The novel is flawlessly conceived and visualized.  The characters are very convincing.  I don't think this book was a metaphor for the world situation.  The Fremen borrow heavily from the Arab world, but look at the Arab world, much of it is desert.  If Europeans who fight in the desert end up using Bedouin techniques and use Arab words like wadi and hammadas, then anyone living and fighting in a desert environment would naturally use the techniques and vocabulary of the world's best desert dwellers, who happen to be Arabs.<br /><br />Dune does an amazing job of combining love, hate, economics, politics, and destiny.  There are so many good storylines in this book that an average author could have derived at least five books from it.  The concept of the Kwisatz Haderach alone, the ultimate being, is handled expertly here.  What would an ultimate being, a living, breathing man who is worshipped as God, be like?  How could you make the ultimate being, and how could you prepare the masses for their messiah?<br /><br />Describing this book in a short review is nearly impossible.  However, I do have to talk about the spice melange.  I'm not sure what psychoactives Herbert ever tried in his life, or even if he ever did anything, but the effects of melange are like the effects of a popular but illegal herb that most Americans have tried at least once, only multiplied a thousand-fold.  Anyone who's read the book knows spice is the cornerstone of the Empire, as its mind-expanding powers allow the human mind to manipulate space and time.  The spice also has the power to unlock genetic memories, extend longevity, and is used recreationally.  In a very subtle and engaging way, Herbert explicitly prescribes the use of mind-expanding drugs.  Mua'dib definitely follows William Blakes advice when he says \\"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,\\" as Mua'dib completes his development as the Kwizatz Haderach by ingesting a toxic overdose of spice, and then experienes a 'trip' in which the deepest mysteries of life are revealed to him, and he becomes nearly omniscient.<br /><br />The love stories and relationships within this book are as compelling as in it.<br /><br />As far as the bad guys in the book go, the Emperor Shaddam the IV, and his tool the Baron Harkonnen are excellent.  The Baron is truly terrifying, and he makes a horrible image.  When telling his nephew, Rabban, how to govern Arrakis, he says \\"You must be always hungry, always thirsty.  Like me.\\"  He then lovingly strokes his rolls of fat.  The Baron's sexual tastes and appetite are also sickening, yet they are described implicitly, unlike in the recent \\"prequel\\" books by Herbert's son.  At the same time, the Baron never falls into the cliches of most bad guys, and the scene in which Jessica and Paul are able to excape his cluthes is done in a very convincing way.  They didn't escape through the palace air shafts or because the Baron designed an overly complex spectacle death for them.<br /><br />All in all, buy this book, since it's most likely the best sci-fi you'll ever have the pleasure of reading.<br /><br />-- JJ Timminslar but illegal herb that most Americans have tried at least once, only multiplied a thousand-fold.

For one, they knew the US was 10,000 miles away.  They 'bled' the US to death, knowing they could lose 10 Vietnamese for every American, and they'd still win.  They also persuaded the US press to their side, and the US countryside was rife with their political organizers.<br /> I'm not choosing sides in this review, but Giap fails to talk about how most of his units were usually completely wiped out anytime they confronted the US military head-on.  But wars are fought on political levels as well as military, and that's where they won.  This knowledge is what the book will give you, if you can read past the weird translation and Giap's constant rhetoric.  You can have the strongest, best military on the planet and still lose if your country's politicos fail you, and the domestic front doesn't have the 'national will' to back you up.	2001-04-30
