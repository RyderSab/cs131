I was at a bookstore and saw it on the shelves, looking very innocent and tempting. WELL, this is a great book! And the author is new so there are more books from Ms. Kabak on my list to be sure. I just hope she writes fast enough for me to devour them. Okay, back to the book. What a wonderful read. I won't repeat every detail or give anything away, but this novel took me back to my past and made me rethink so many things that had happened to me in terms of my relationships, especially with my own mother and ex-husband. It's the kind of novel where you say to yourself: Yes, I am that woman. That was me. And you feel Katie Cadogan's (the protagonist) embarassments, frustrations, joys and awkward moments as she journeys back to her teen years, then through all the incidents (some horrifying) in her life that brought her to where she is now, and where she ends up: a completely independent woman who knows what she wants and makes decisions based not on other's needs and demands--not anymore--but on her own. Read this novel. Buy it. It's a very special, beautifully written book.	2005-07-15

I have a dog-earred copy because I've read ANGEL CAFE again and again. It moved me to the point of biting my nails to the quick. You will love it. A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED first novel by an author with a great future. (I've been waiting for her next book forever.)	2004-04-05

History at its finest and most alluring--that's what you'll find when you read Maureen Ogle's, KEY WEST. This book is so well-written that for the first time in my life, I've decided to check out Hemingway-land for myself. I have a feeling I'm going to love it--almost as much as I loved this book! Did I mention the romance &amp; mystery? It's there, along with some fantastic photos of balls and locals and tourists and all sorts of events from days gone-by. This is a really, really special book that will remain in my library forever.	2004-03-30
US	53072883	RMD14K5JHQDOX	0804119635	54236358	Black Lion's Bride	Books	5	8	10	N	N	One of my top five romance novels	I have read all of Tina's books and this one is my favorite. It has everything you want in a medieval, passion, history, action and a hero and heroine who are equals and show their growing love for one another through what they say, do and feel. I really loved the hero, SEBASTIAN. He's strong, uber-sexy, intelligent and oh-so-male. Zahirah is the perfect counterpart to Sebastian in that she heats up the all-work/no play side of his heart. Yet she's quite tortured, too, with goals of her own and isn't a place-holder heroine. Buy this book. You will love it! Yay, Tina! You did it again! :)	2002-05-02

LORD OF FIRE is a big romance; in fact, it's why I read romance, because beneath the layers of pain, endearing moments, darkness and joy in LOF, there is an all encompassing love story that made me read this book from beginning to end until I couldn't see anything or anyone but Lucien--the hero. Fine with me! :) It's not a simple tale, it's exciting and like all of Gaelen's books it comes from this author's heart. I hear every word she writes, and with LOF, the characters just pop right up and grab you by the throat. They say: pay attention I have a story to tell you, one that you'll not only read, but you'll feel in your heart and in your soul. Can you tell how I much I loved this book? From the moment I met Lucien, I knew I had a keeper on my hands. Lucien is bad, oh, so bad and yet he's vulnerable and exciting, too. He has a purpose, which I don't want to spoil for you if you haven't read this book yet, but I will tell you that he came alive for me with everything he did and said and felt. Alice, the heroine, is his exact opposite, and Gaelen demonstrates this from the moment we meet her. I really, really loved Alice because beneath her starchy exterior is a tigress. However, it's clear that both Alice and Lucien need each other desperately. That's what's so striking and memorable to me about LORD OF FIRE; that these two polar opposites who really shouldn't be together at all need one other from the start. Gaelen had me convinced of their love from the moment she put Alice and Lucien together. I loved it and am recommending LOF to all my friends who love Romance. Now I'm counting the hours until I can read Lucien's twin brother Damien's story in LORD OF ICE.	2002-01-23

I swear, she only gets better with each book. WLL captivated me from the moment I read the first page in which Isabel de Lamere meets her &quot;Lion,&quot; Griffin of Droghallow. Years later, Griff is the kind of man who will do anything for a price, even kidnap an heiress. So he does. However, the dangerous circumstances he finds himself in, the most potent of which are Isabel's obvious and bewitching charms, throws him into a whirlwind of danger and high stakes love as he and Isabel journey together through the middle ages and into each other's hearts. Now I cannot wait for Tina's next book, Black Lion's Bride! Highly, highly recommended.	2001-07-31

I especially enjoyed the hero because he never took the easy way out, and neither did this author with her plot. It's just a great follow-up to Ms. Irvin's debut, FOR HIS EYES ONLY. If you love strong heroines and complex...heros thrown into intense situations, you will love IN CLOSE QUARTERS.	2001-05-14

Marsha C. is one of my favorite (top five) authors and this book does not disappoint. You know (this is for the reader who gave it a one heart) if you don't like heavy, lush HISTORICAL romances and prefer the lighter ones, then why buy this author? All her books are heavy on the historical, dark, realistic, complex and intense. Tastes differ and so do authors. Get off her back and stop trying to twist her talent into some sort of Julie Garwood sugary pap. Ugh.<br />So, anyway, I love this book! An autobuy author for me. Thanks, Marsha!	2001-04-25

I think this is her best yet, although I have a strong attachment to THE PIRATE PRINCE. Anyway, THE DUKE is the first in a series and features believable, interesting and smart characters. Oh, yeah, the hero is pretty darn sexy too! You will not be disappointed. Buy this book now before it's too late and you can't find it -- because it's a keeper and this author isn't afraid to take chances with style, story-telling or craft.	2000-12-11

I only recently discovered this author but boy am I sure glad I did. I kid you not. Ms. St. John is fantastic and Lady of valur is my kind of romance. I don't want to give too much away, but here's the storyline: After coming upon his wretched and very dead comrade on Crusade, Sir Cabal is ordered by King Richard to oversee the dead man's castle, skillfully and independently being run by his beautiful widow. What makes this medieval stand out in my mind are the characters. Cabal and Emmalyn are adults and act like it all the while they must fight their attraction to one another. Their love story begins as a friendship and they both heal one another. The love story is beautiful, poignant and touching. You will enjoy this novel immensely. I cannot wait for her next book. Ms. St. John, now you must write faster now that I've discovered you. Thank you.	2000-11-02

But mostly i'm peeved for not discovering her sooner, but at least I did. :) This is a more tempestutous book that Lady, but just as fine, just as poignant. Lord of Vengeance is a book you do not want to miss, whether you read romance or not! I am sure this book will change your mind or at least give you hours of reading pleasure. Gunnar and Raina were absolutely delightful and the way he grew and changed in the face of true love after losing so much in his life, was a joy to read and live. I wish the book were longer!! Fantastic job. I cannot wait to meet Ms. St. John in person! Thank you.	2000-11-02

I really wanted to love this book and have been trying to figure out why I didn't; why I wanted to fling it into a pit of fire. Content-wise it told me all about Jerry to the nth degree. In a trite, trivial voice!  Oh, it  could have been a contender. It could have been wonderful because the  follow-a-manager-for-a-year angle is cool. But the problem is Ms. Baker  doesn't know how to tell an exciting story, a story with moments and  dialogue and emotion. Instead, she transcribes facts!  The pacing is  turtle-slow, and the writer tries far too hard to be clever by saying  things with icky cliches and similies. I wanted to take a pen and edit. I'm  sorry to sound harsh that's not my intention because I really think it's  not all the author's fault. The editors were asleep. Needs more white space  and more pronouns instead of &quot;Jerry this&quot; and &quot;Jerry  that.&quot; Nothing fresh, not even a bit twisted. Sigh. What was it about  again?	2000-07-22

Oh, what am I saying? They're all terrific reads, brimming with emotion, fully developed characters, plots and rich settings. Suspense lies  inside the hearts' of these characters, and she keeps you wondering about  them long after you've closed the book. All of her books are keepers for  me, I just wish she would write faster. It's probably one of the reasons  why many don't know about this wonderful author. If you like richly told  novels, real novels with characters that stay with you for years to come,  don't miss this book.	2000-06-26

Well the story is good, strong plot, twists, turns, etc., however were these elements not as intriguing as they were, this book would have hit the wall. I knew the  characters were cardboard cutouts the minute you said that Lesley became an  account executive after being a junior copywriter. First of all, NO AEs aka  &quot;suits&quot; are previous copywriters -- or hardly ever! Writers  write, just like you! In today's ad agencies writers are called: Creatives.  Account Executives are not Creatives. AEs DON'T concept ideas for  campaigns. Anyway, this is what made your characters seem silly to me. And  Lesley began at a P.R. agency, so why were they coming up with ad  campaigns? P.R. is based on journalism, not creative and marketing! Maybe  some people don't care about reality based characters, but I do. I still  enjoyed your twists and turns, but I really wish you'd do your research  when it comes to professions outside of your own. Thanks!	2000-05-17

That's how much I loved LADY OF VALOR; that's how much I adore Tina St. John's writing. Lady Emmalyn of Fallonmour was particularly well done. She is a strong, classy heroine in every sense. Cabal (Blackheart) is a  hero to steal your heart, but his tortured soul only belongs to Emmalyn --  eventually. From the first page to the last, he's dark, dangerous and  utterly compelling. The writing is beautiful and clean! I didn't think she  could top LORD OF VENGEANCE, but the author proved me (happily) wrong. Buy  this book!	2000-04-28

I'm exhausted because I stayed up until three a.m. to finish this magical book! PRINCE CHARMING is that good. If you like fast-paced books with well-developed characters and conflicts that are fun yet heart-tugging, you'll love PRINCE CHARMING by Gaelen Foley. The villain is very, very bad  as well, not to mention facinating. I've read all three books in the  Ascencion Trilogy and cannot imagine how this author is going to top  herself. Rafael (Rafe the Rake) and Daniela Chiaramonte were meant for each  other from the first moment of their exciting meeting to the last page.  What's great about PC is that while Rafe and Dani have their differences,  they also talk. And the big misunderstanding that's often problematic with  romance novels is non-existent here. A truly exciting, magnifique read from  rising romance star, Gaelen Foley!  Don't walk, RUN out and buy all three  books in this trilogy before they are gone: THE PIRATE PRINCE; PRINCESS;  AND PRINCE CHARMING. You'll love them.	2000-04-03

She's an auto-buy for me, and I'll be on  the lookout for more authors who offer these types of stories!

I've read all her books except the first one (Shadows in Velvet), but plan to do so pronto! Her books are not only rich in history and romance, they have a  touch of mystery as well. Also the plots are well developed with high  quality prose and facinating characters that you fall in love with from  page one. In DANGEROUS GIFTS, Claire and Palmer are two lost souls who find  each other through the magic of healing. The author does a great job of  delivering an excellent read here. Ten stars! Other really good books by  H.S. are SECRETS IN SATIN and DAMASK ROSE.	1999-08-29

Whenever I read a five-star review of this book where the reader gushes by saying: &quot;Beautifully written,&quot; and/or &quot;historically accurate, lush, vivid, etc.,&quot; all I can think is that Ms. Jaffe has a  lot of terrific friends out there, or that these reviewers have never read  past Jackie Collins. The Stargazer is FAR from beautifully written or  well-crafted, (Hello point-of-view???, hello style? Hello good writing???)  and the editor knows it. But a Ph.d and long, flowing hair that holds a  curl do make for a nice package. Alas, Kathryn Lynn Davis (a Pocket romance  author who truly is a word-artist) has a new book coming out soon and I'm  thrilled about that. I really wanted to like the Stargazer, but it's so  poorly written, it's offensive. Sorry.	1999-08-05

After reading Gaelen Foley's terrific first book, THE PIRATE PRINCE, I thought there wasn't any way for this author to outdo herself. I was wrong. PRINCESS is a lush, intriguing, sweeping romance with  just the right balance of plot, character and narrative. Ms. Foley is  quickly becoming one of my favorite historical romance authors. In fact, I  think she's better than many of the old favorites who just keep writing the  same story over and over,  or whose style is synonymous with tired writing.  I wish MORE publishers would publish new authors with fresh, exciting, rich  voices such as Ms. Foley's.	1999-07-24

It's a beautiful medieval tale in every sense in that the hero, Gunnar Rutledge, so brimming with hatred and vengeance and angst, especially in the  beginning of LOV, changes his destructive path because of the gentle, sweet  as well as fiery love of his heroine, Raina, his enemy's daughter. The  writing is excellent and so is the story. I don't want to give away the  plot, but if you're looking for a fun, exciting historical romance told  with a fresh voice, LORD OF VENGEANCE will sweep you right off your feet,  your toes, your whatever!

It's a facinating story touching on the Battle of Hastings, and threading in the tale of a Norman hero and his Saxon lady-wife. But it's not the same old  story; and it's not supposed to be a historical novel, per se. It's a  romance, which reads like a romance!! Powerful, emotional, funny in places  and complete with three-dimensional characters. The writing style is also  surprisingly wonderful. Try it. You'll love it!!	1998-12-07

Loved it,  especially the scene where Barbara visits Jeremy because she believes him  to be the Devil!! Excellent dialogue, as usual. Realistic-silliness. My  only quip was that Barbara (the heroine) could have been a bit older to  make her problems seem more realistic. Maybe in her 40s instead of 30s.  (Midlife isn't in your 30s, especially these days.) Anyway, Big fun, and  better than The Club. More please.	1998-09-10
