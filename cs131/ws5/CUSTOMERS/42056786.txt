When I first bought it I wasn't sure I would like it because I thought it was all about out-of-body experiences, but it turned out to be much much more.  It's an autobiography about this guy (Steve) who is an aspiring actor- song writer and he's searching for so much more in his life.  It's a fast read, and really good !  It has the feeling like he and you are just sitting in his living room, and he's telling you all this stuff he's experienced and learned.....like you're a friend of his and you can't help but be pulled into his adventures !!  It's also funny, which I love.  Check it out !	2005-10-14

All these reviews pretty much tell you the basic story.  I'm just going to say that I enjoyed the book.

I am 3/4 done with this book, and I haven't finished it yet, but I wanted to write this review.  It's about Terry's childhood, and then her life on her own, out in the big world.  She goes to New York, gets jobs, gets roommates........and it continues about her discovering herself and her world and her relationship to her family members.  It gets a little bogged down at times because it seems like she's having a hard time growing up and being on her own, and you just want her to get on with it. <br /> <br />There are some things in this book that caught me off guard a little.  It got a little kinky and weird at times, but it is about her life and experiences, so you have to go with it to continue with the story.  Like I said, I haven't finished it yet, but I am anxious to get back to it.  She is a good story teller and is brutally honest.  That's all I ask for in a good book.  She has the guts to tell her story, because she doesn't always look good in the situations she finds herself in. She doesn't always make the right decisions! <br /> <br />So, At 3/4 done reading this book, I give it 5 stars because it has held my interest.	2005-09-09

This book attempts to write about past life regression but fails miserably.  The author, Ahad, meets this older, very interesting woman, who proceeds to work with him to release some of his anger, frustration,and unhappiness in this life by regressing him to his past lives, and therefore releasing him from all the bad feelings he has built up, and setting him free, or as the title says &quot;Releasing (him from) Past-Life Recordings&quot;  What results is a bunch of nonsense, most of which I had a hard time trying to understand.  Alot of talking in circles, not making any sense, and just plain ridiculous.  I have read many books on past-life regression, and believe it is a very fascinating and real experience which can be very useful to those who use it. I have no doubt as to its validity, but this book is not a good example to learn from or understand about past-life regression. It's the worst I have read in a long time.  Sorry Ahad.

I thought this was a fascinating autobiographical story of a very successful business man, who has a heart attack at a young age, and thus goes through an amazing spiritual transformation.  He travels to many exotic places, and adopts the Buddhist life style and religion, which by the way, is a very wonderful, wise, and tranquil path of spirituality.

When I first started reading this book, I thought, hmmmmm...., just another self-absorbed autobiography of someone who doesn't have any serious training about the mysteries of life.<BR>   I was WRONG !! As I kept reading, her engrossing story soon showed a very wise and thoughtful person, who expanded her perceivment of life through her life's trials and a near-death experience.  Her near-death experience was the catalyst, which propelled her on her way to understanding our spiritual selves and our beautiful, fragile Earth.<BR>   During the five minutes that she was \\"dead\\", she travelled to the Other Side and was shown some amazing things (I don't want to ruin it for you, so I won't give too many details).<BR>   Her story is told in a very honest, interesting, and heartfelt way, which truly draws you in to understand what she experienced and the information she brought back with her.  It is wonderful, illuminating, and very warm and comforting.  It is also disturbing, and sends an urgent message.<BR>   I really enjoyed this book......it was definitely worth the money.  Hashi-Hanta is very lucky to have had her near-death experience, and to come back with so much knowledge/information to share that applies to all of us.  We are all together on this Earth.<BR>   The ending erupts into a powerful disertation (not preaching) on our humaness, our spirituality, our uniqueness, and our responsibility to our planet, Earth.  I became glued to what was written, and quite frankly, rendered awe-struck.  Wow ! I'm amazed at how right-on she is, and I am so very glad I found this wonderful, inspiring book.<BR>   I invite you to do the same, and see if it doesn't ignite something in your heart and soul.	2002-10-11

Sylvia is now in her 60's, and she has had a very interesting life helping other people understand themselves, here on Earth and on the Other Side.  I have read just about every book about New Age Spirituality, some very good, but I keep on coming on back to Sylvia Browne.  She is the best, period.  If you haven't read her other books yet, do yourself a favor and do so.....you will be amazed!  She is so smart, funny and loving.  I just can't say enough about her wisdom, down to earth approach, and totally honest, heart felt information and advise.  She is my HERO, and has made my life so much better! She also cracks me up, because she is very funny, and at the same time totally serious, because she really does care about how YOU are doing!  She is an AMAZING woman who has alot to offer anyone who would like to listen.  You will be soo happy if you check her out!	2002-08-08

I love Mary Sparrowdancer's writing style, which is witty, funny, and enchanting.  Mary is a normal housewife, married to a lawyer, with two normal kids.  She starts seeing odd objects lying around her house and yard, such as white stones and pottery shards.  Perplexed, she wonders where they're from, and she begins to have visions of Indians congregating in her yard.  She wonders if she is going crazy because no one else can see them.  Then a Being of Light comes to her and the strange odyssey begins....her search for God and the truth of humanity.  Her enfolding adventures are amazing and sometimes hilarious.  The ending is unbelievable!! It gave me chills and almost made me cry from the incredible secret knowledge that she discovered, some of which I have suspected for a long time, so it was awesome to see it written in a book. This is by far one of my favorite books, and I highly recommend it to everyone.  You won't be disappointed!!	2002-06-18

I had heard of Earlyne Chaney before, but have never read any of her books till now.  I am SO glad I found this book!! What an amazingly inspirational and moving story. I just loved this book! It's a story about Earlyne's poor, but stable childhood, during which she meets her discarnate spiritual teacher who appears to her one day, informing her of events that will happen in her lifetime, and that he will be with her through it all. Her adventures lead her into Army volunteer work during WW11, where she meets her true love, a pilot. Tragedy strikes suddenly, and her world falls apart. She feels forsaken by her teacher, and plummets into despair.  She then resolves to find out what happened to her beloved pilot....how can she find him on the &quot;other side&quot;. She is determinedly drawn into a metaphysical quest which leads to many many surprises!  I stayed up until 4:00 in the morning to finish this book.....I just couldn't put it down!  It's a bargain for the price, I would have paid more for this enchanting book!  I also learned alot of fascinating things that I didn't already know, and I'm an avid reader of this genre. Somehow, I feel like Earlyne Chaney is now a friend of mine even though she has since passed. She was probably smiling down at me as I read her wonderful book!!	2002-06-03

This book has alot of stuff in it......autobiographical, spiritual, karma, past lives, and other numerous insights. The first two chapters are a little too lengthy, and quite frankly as the book itself admits, you can skip Chapter 1 &amp; 2, and just start with Chapter 3, &quot;Episodes From Past Lives&quot;.

It is interesting, but when the author (Hugh Cayce) quotes his father, I can't understand a word he's saying. Most of the book is done in a question and answer format between Edgar Cayce and his client, in quotations (his own words). For instance : &quot;(Q) What form of consciousness does the spirit entity assume?&quot;  He is asked by the client.<BR>&quot;(A)  That of the subconscious consciousness, as known in the material plane, or the acts and deeds, and thoughts, done in the body, are ever present before that being.  Then consider what a hell digged by some, and what a haven and heaven builded by many.&quot;   HUH ???  The whole book is like this......impossible to decipher and understand.

Her story on a personal level is interesting, but more than that, this book has alot of information about the NDE, and what the experiencers go through AFTER it happens to them, and how to understand it, cope with it, and incorporate it into their lives.  All the big names of researchers of NDEs are consulted, and there is alot to be learned for everyone, especially the experiencer themselves.  It's all about understanding this true and real phenomena, and how to deal with it.  Interesting and helpful.  ... The experience is totally real and it's about time we talked about it!

I really wanted to like this book, and it was interesting because of the subject matter, but I felt it got bogged down in the respect that the author was constantly running around from one &quot;controlled experiment&quot; to another to prove his abilities to everyone.  Yes, he probably does have these amazing psychic and healing abilities, but he should stop trying so hard to prove it with one &quot;test&quot; after another.........enough already! Another thing that bothered me was his obvious jealousy toward Uri Geller, another PSI gifted fellow, who was very popular during that time. This shouldn't be about who is better or more amazing at their gift.......the gift alone is enough.  The writing style was also a little stiff. He needed to loosen up a little and enjoy life and his gift a little more. Don't be so uptight and competitive!  Would anyone like to buy my copy?	2002-05-18

I read all the other reviews and I think they are all pretty much the way I feel, but I have one point that bothered me. Or is it two points?  First, the book was more about Marilyn than anything else, and second, I wasn't ready for her intimate story of her and her lesbian girlfriend.  I have nothing against lesbians at all, but when I buy a book that makes you think you are getting a story about past lives, etc., then that's what I'm expecting. I really didn't bargain for a story about her love-sick relationship with her female lover.  That bothers me because I didn't buy the book for that.  So, now you know, and can be more informed than I was before you buy the book. In a nut shell, it's about Marilyn and her female lover who have a very dysfunctual relationship.	2002-05-13

This true story is so amazing for many reasons, that I simply could not put it down from the minute I started reading it. I had a husband to greet and a dinner to cook, but I couldn't put the book down. RaNelle and Terry's ordeal from their plane crash is told in graphic, heart-wrenching, horrifying detail.  Again I say WOW!  Absolutely incredible.  I'm not gonna give details because you have to read it to see how extraordinary it is.  Then, to me, the good part starts.  RaNelle has a Near-Death Experience right after being rescued.  What follows made me cry.  I felt her pain, fear and wonder.  Her descriptions of the Other Side are breathtaking, astounding, and there are lessons to be learned for all of us who want to listen.

I bought it because I thought it was more about her Near-death experiences and how she coped with that, but the story is really about HER. Yes, she does have some Near-Death Experiences, but that is only secondary is the story behind her terrible asthma problems. Her travelling experiences are interesting, especially about different cultures, like Iran and other countries, but most of the book in entertwined around her asthma difficulties. Perhaps the title should read \\"My Asthma and Europe\\". That would be more appropiate. Bottom Line :  I did enjoy the book for the travel narrative, but I'm a little tired of her affliction and she's too far away from me to hand her an inhaler, so I got frustrated.	2002-05-13

It is a very small book which is over priced, and that alone is a warning signal.  So, bottom line.......check it out for yourself, if you don't mind paying too much.	2002-05-13

Not only was it interesting, but it made me feel like part of their family as I was reading it. Lovely, charming, and amazing. The part when his aunt was dying was incredible, and so touching, but not sad. Well, maybe a good sad. Powerful and sweet book. I don't think you'll be disappointed!	2002-05-13

All I got was a young woman whinning and complaining about her &quot;powers&quot; (??), and that they were too much for her. She hyperventilated, whinned, cried, and over indulged herself throughout the whole book. Her wimpy boyfriend (I'm sorry) was constantly rubbing her neck and telling her everything would be ok, and what could he get her to make her feel better (gag). I only made it through 1/3 of the book, and I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm sorry, but come on! Maybe it's just that the author is a little young and has some growing up to do.......I think so.	2002-05-13

I just finished reading this book, and I loved it sooo much! I didn't want it to end!  It's the story of a Mother whose son was tragically killed in a car accident, and her subsequent contact with him on the Other Side, and how she coped with her heart wrenching loss. The author writes so naturally and beautifully telling the whole amazing story, you feel like she's talking to you, her best friend. You can truly feel her pain, frustration, love and happiness as the story unfolds.  Judy Collier speaks from the depths of her heart as she takes you with her on an inspiring quest to stay in contact with her beloved son, Kyle, and learns many lessons along the way. She meets with several well-known psychic/mediums (which is so incredibly fascinating, because it is for real......no nonsense) who facillitate her contact with the Other Side, and ultimately you will see that contact with a loved one on the Other Side is possible if you just take the time to DO IT <br />Thank you Judy for a wonderful book........I almost want to read it all over again, and maybe I just will!<br />...	2002-05-12

I read Scott Russell Hill's first book \\"Caught Between Two Worlds\\" and I loved it. In fact, after I read his first book, I ordered \\"Psychic\\" and was looking forward to reading it.  It is an unusual story (albeit true) of a guy (Scott) trudging through life, and all the while he is psychic.  The oddness of this story is that he doesn't seem to think that that is so unusual, and so his attitude is a little too blase' for my taste.  He sees ghosts and UFOs on a regular basis, which to anyone is a little out there!!  Somehow, he gets away with it, being so nonchalant, and seeming to think that everyone else does this too. Hmmmmm. No, not everyone is as psychic as you are, Scott, but more power to you anyway!!  There is some UFO action in this story also, but he makes it believable somehow with his care-free, no big deal demeanor.  So, is this a true story?  He thinks it is, and I'm not sure he isn't telling the truth.<BR>     Bottom line..........yes, buy the book.  I enjoyed it and you might too.  For some reason, it seems to hook you the minute you open the front cover, if only to see what the hell he's up to now.  Oh yes, and two more things.....he needs to find a lady friend who can settle him down, and he needs to stay at home instead of chasing old loser friends. Smiling more would be good too.	2002-05-12

It starts out a little slow for my taste, but it picks up, and becomes very interesting.  The first part of the book is mostly about Brian's childhood, and how he felt different from most children, and how he did not have a very good relationship with his parents, always trying to please them, but not able to, by no fault of his own. His Mother wasn't exactly the most supportive person in his life. He stumbles and bumbles about learning of his extraordinary psychic abilities, finally to become at ease with them, and how these abilities grew into an amazing side of Brian Hurst and furthered his awesome career/life.  There is no doubt at all about his honesty and sincerity of all the events that take place, and you almost wish you could invite him over for dinner to chat about all of this.  All in all it is a very enjoyable book, worth the money.  He is a very believable fellow, who seems like he could live next door to you and you might not know how amazing he really is! But beware, the first two chapters are boring and too involved in his childhood, which is not exactly the most fascinating reading, but it DOES get better!  I'm giving him 5 stars because I truly believe him, and he has a fascinating life! Brian, why don't you come to Hawaii so I can meet you !!?  Bottom line.....buy the book, it's worth it.	2002-05-12
