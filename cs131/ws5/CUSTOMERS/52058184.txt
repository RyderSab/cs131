The art work is hilarious! Celery stands with arms akimbo along with the other angry vegetables who throw Eggbert out of his home in the refrigerator, into the world. It is a message of hope and acceptance of yourself that spans the ages. I bought it because I fanned through the book and loved the art work, but the story that goes with Eggbert's tale of self-acceptance makes this book a classic for children. I want to see more of artist Rex Barron's work and hope he pairs up with the author, Tom Ross, again.	2004-04-25

Recently our theme for the week was the biography of the famous ballet star, Evelyn Cisneros.Unfortunately, our school library did not have any information on Cisneros at the time. Instead, our media specialist read this wonderful book by Debbie Allen of \\"FAME\\" fame. Well, let me tell you, my students never laughed so hard during a book. They just simply loved it. <br />Put-downs are a fact of life, especially (and unfortunately) in elementary school.  I think the students really got the message loud and clear and in a fun and interesting, not preachy, way. As a class, we discussed how people are different and we need to accept others without making fun of them. It was also clear that we sound horrible when we tease and taunt each other, too. There were really great points of discussion above and beyond ballet and dancing.<br />Debbie Allen is truly talented and not just as a dancer! My students learned about the world of ballet, which was new to them. They were engaged while being read to and afterwards enjoyed talking and laughing about this book. I found it to be a tremendous teaching tool in that  it opened up many topics of discussion that week and students connected to this book in an exciting way.  It spoke to them in their own language and that's a difficult thing to do! My students can be hard to reach through books and yet Debbie Allen accomplished it with ease.<br />The pictures were a delight, very expressive. I will buy this book now and use it in my classroom every year. I strongly recommend this book as a teaching tool, in all neighborhoods. I hope Allen writes more for children soon.	2003-03-29

This is a wonderful book in so many ways. <br />The colorful artwork from David Catrow is charming, wild and vividly exciting.

Hilarity ensues when Mr. Lester grants that request. Mortimer's mother writes a few letters herself when Plantzilla gets out of hand.<br />This is an original tale with beautiful illustrations and a powerful message.

I agree completely with the previous reviewer that stated that they were not sure they \\"enjoyed\\" this book. However, it was extremely well-written in an enchanting, dream-like style. It lulls you in and then bangs you over the head with it's subject matter of abuse, confinement, imprisonment, rape, torture and drug-use. Not comfortable subject matter, but is life always comfortable and happy? I don't think any author today is as powerful as Kirsty Gunn to make such an ugly and horribly macabre story so compelling and interesting. Isn't that what good authors do? They seduce you by excellent writing to visit another world, completely different and unique and yes, horrible to fathom.<br />I preferred Rain, Gunn's first novel. Rain was also a painful, but well-written read about an uncomfortable subject matter. I find her writing poetic and beautiful and yes, carthritic. An amzazing talent and two truly hypnotic novels: The Keepsake and Rain. Don't miss either novel from this extraordianaryly talented young muse.	2003-01-01

The story revolves around three lines that are friends and the language is amazing. Mem Fox is a wonderfully creative author.<br />A fellow teacher shared this book with me. She fell in love with it at the Florida Reading Association conference last month and just had to buy it. We are studying intersecting lines, parallel lines and perpindicular lines in my fifth grade classroom. I thought this would be a fun book to read to the class so that we could discuss different types of lines. <br />After I read the story to my class we listed all of the verbs in the story and believe me, they are original!  I don't want to spoil it for you by directly quoting from the book. We also talked about being different, of being true to yourself and not being afraid to think outside of the box. These were univesal themes the books touched on as well.<br />I recommend this book, you can certainly use it to teach &quot;across the curriculum.&quot;	2001-11-04

This is fun to read simply because of the time period it was written in--the late 50's. You can enjoy the innocence of the 50's before America went to space firsthand. This series was written by Eleanor Cameron on the prompting of her son. I agree with the other reviewer--this is not the best book the series has to offer. The illustrations are very good though. I say if you enjoy nostalgia and great writing, you will want to read this book and the rest in the series.	2001-08-02

True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature. <br />This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;<br />The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.<br />However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen. <br />Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read.	2001-07-31

This is an old picture book that won the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1950. It is a cute tale of a young Mexican-American boy who lives by the Mission San Juan Capistrano. Juan visits the mission coming home from school to visit his friend Julian, the old gentleman who works there.<br />The colorful drawings evoke San Juan years and years ago and are very touching, especially if you live in that area or have visited. The story of the swallows coming to Capistrano on St. Joseph's Day also shows the qualities of patience and hope little Juan has. He plants a garden to attract the swallows to his adobe home as well. A beautiful and timeless tale.	2001-07-31

This is a good book for the Middle School set to read. It's about a girl named Franny Dillman who creates an interesting life based on teen problem books that her mother brings home for her. Franny's mother is concerned about Franny reading &quot;adult&quot; books in her closet by flashlight such as Jane Eyre. Franny feels as though she has a boring, tranquil life so to shake it up and make things more interesting, she imagines her life along the books she reads. She makes her life parallel to the plots and the people she goes to school with into characters out of Jane Eyre. <br />Her mother, wanting to help Franny adjust properly with the real world and her imagination gives her teen appropriate books that just make matters worse, but the situations are hilarious!	2001-07-31

As many teachers do, I try to preview and read books before I introduce them into the classroom. This summer I read a slew of books and really enjoyed Harriet the Spy. <br />It was written like nothing I have ever read before. Harriet is a different breed altogether. She is going through great changes in her life and is not even that likable as a person. However, she is very real. Her situations and her explorations are strange, unique and funny. I wish I had read this in the fifth grade! I really think that my students are going to love and enjoy it when I read this book out loud to them this coming school year.<br />You'll enjoy Harriet's spying escapades, the characters she views and writes in her journal about and her outlook on friends and family. The other characters in the book are equally off-beat, real and hilarious. Harriet the Spy is a masterpiece of children's literature and one to be enjoyed for years to come I hope.	2001-07-31

It is an excellent re-telling of the too well-known story of Cinderella. The illustrations are colorful and over-the-top! Lots of laughs everytime you look closer and see more in the intricate and colorful pictures. Kids of all ages will love this book. <br />It certainly gives a fun and creative spin to a tired old tale. I love the story of Cinderella, but there are not many new ways to tell it. This story proves that theory absolutely wrong! I agree with the observation that the drawings are very Tim Burtonesque. It reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas, and yet it has it's very own identity. If you like Halloween or gothic humor, you will love this story.	2001-07-31

If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much. <br />In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written.

I am glad I picked it up again and read it after two years of teaching in an inner city school. It has helped me to refocus my attentions on my students and their learning, not their test scores. The state I live and teach in, Florida, is a state that is very focused on standardized test scores. The A+ plan is really shifting teachers to teach for test results. It is frustrating. I see the coding and labeling of a child's learning from a parent's standpoint of view when reading this book. It reads fast and rings true.

LM Montgomery weaves such a magical spell with her plot, characters, and of course the wonderful setting and backdrop of Prince Edward Island. I could not put this book down once I started it as with all of her tales. If you read LM, you will recognize the surnames of many characters as being related to people in the Anne of Green Gables series. Some of the stories are more dated than others, but that is the charm of them as well. You are reading history and the different attitudes that society had towards being an &quot;old maiden lady,&quot; marriage and the caste-like system. The stories are intriguing touched with an unrealism and some stories even have a supernatural touch. Must read for all Anneophiles and bibliophiles that like the Edwardian era.	2001-05-05

This third installment in the Anne of Green Gables series is a lot of fun to read because it focuses on Anne's college years. Many readers remark that this book is their favorite in the Anne series, but I think it is difficult to assign one book that honor. All of the books fit so well together. I would have liked more detail. There were too many friends and not enough story line to justify so many people in her life. I love Patty's Place and Anne's life at Redmond, but I actually wanted more time devoted to her life in Redmond. I guess this is a sign of a true fan to want more. More time could have been spent developing the friends and friendships. I think Montgomery grew tired of writing the Anne series and rushed it along from time to time.	2001-04-22

I wanted to read this whole story. As a fifth grade teacher, we read a portion of this tale in the Scholastic series. The students really seem to respond to Minna's troubles, so it inspired me to go out and purchase the book to read the entire story.

The friend proving loyalty is  the white man to the black man. This is a new one. It is the black man who  has good fortune and is getting married! We need more examples like this in  children's literature of mixed friendships, different ways to look at the  world, new culture, strange new lands, and ties that bind people together  rather than the tired old stereotypes. The students in my classroom loved  this tale, because it was so fresh and new. As a teacher who is caucasian  teaching in a predominantly black school, I look to Robert D.

It opened up discussion in the class more than any other book I  have read to them this school year.  It is colorful, creative and fun.  You  can have the students use toothpicks and gummy bears to create the greedy  little triangle and then change shapes as it metamorphisizes. Food is a  great motivator. A fun way to instill a love of both reading and geometry.  When the book is over, the kids can be &quot;greedy&quot; and eat their  creations.  Trust me, they will never forget the lesson.	2000-03-26

This is a fantastically quick read, very interesting and unique.  Konigsburg is excellent at her craft.  She never preaches or talks down to her young readers.  No wonder her books are so timeless.  This book is over  30 years old, and it still stands up. A classic in children's lit.	2000-02-26

So much so that I devoured it in two sittings, two days!  Seeing the 1995 BBC movie version made me go out and purchase the book.  The book  and movie are excellent if you are an incurable romantic such as myself.  The writing is brilliant, the characters well-crafted. Anne is a heroine of  today, thoroughly modern in every way!  Amanda Root and Cirian Hinds do a  remarkable job in the movie. Please do yourself a favor and read the book  though first.	1999-12-26

This book is an absolute gem, and I cannot believe that other readers could be so harsh with it. They complain that it is hard to follow or that it seems as if there are more stories going on than just a main story  theme.  Well, that fits the whole &quot;flashback&quot; of a man  remembering his boyhood many years ago.  I think that the very fact that  the story jumps around in a non-linear fashion is befitting a tale of one's  childhood.  Are we remembering right?  We embellish things as we recall our  childhood memories because growing up, we process differently.   Circumstances and happenings take on epidemic proportions. Sometimes they  really are worthy of our childish angst. I think that's what makes this  story so riveting.  It brings back a rush of our own childhood memories  both good, bad, scary, indifferent with it's vivid recollections.  I love  this book dearly, and it is one of the few books that I bother to pick up  again and again.  As a teacher, I find going back to the &quot;good old  days&quot; of my own youth, or another's youth to be cathartic.   Furthermore, it helps me stay grounded with the students I teach. Bradbury  is adept at recalling a host of memories with his beautiful storytelling.	1999-12-22

I love the original versions of the books in this series that Applewood Publishing has been printing. If you are a Mother who read the series, these make excellent books for your daughters who love to read and like a  good mystery!The illustrations are great.The dialogue is dated, but only  leads to the charm of these books.The true author's name was Mildred Wirt  Benson, a ghost writer from the MidWest.She was the first graduate of  journalism from the University of Iowa.She writes an introduction to this  book that is worth the price of the book alone!Not my favorite in the  series, but it still evokes the spirit of the 30's and the fun I had  curling up and devouring these books on a rainy weekend afternoon.	1999-12-17

The Applewood Publishing Company's original version is the true, original story first published in the 1930's. Don't waste your time with the horrid (in my opinion) re-written, condensed versions that came out later. This was actually written by a man from what I have read! The original author of  the series, Mildred Wirt Benson, was not asked to write this one. I read in  the terrific book &quot;Rediscovering Nancy Drew&quot; by Carolyn Stewart  Dyer that Benson and the Stratemyer Syndicate (who published the Nancy Drew  series) had many conflicts over Nancy's character and how she should write  the series instead of just letting her author the books. Mildred Wirt  Benson later returned to write the 11th book of the series and resumed  until #25, and then her last one for the series was #30. Stratemeyer also  argued with man who wrote this mystery for the series in Benson's absence.  I believe #8,9,10 were all written by the same male writer who also wrote  screenplays for movies. This is an excellent story, and I heartily enjoy  all of the original versions. They are far superior to the low-rent  rewritten versions.  Even as a child reading the series 20 years ago I  enjoyed the orginal 30's versions of the series over the faster-paced but  trashy re-written versions.  I remember feeling as though my intelligence  was being insulted with the yellow-bound rewrites, so I searched the  shelves at the library for the old-school versions.  I am enjoying buying  these old original versions for my collection, and rereading them when I  have a little extra time.	1999-12-17

The Applewood originals are far superior and are highly recommended by most Nancy Drew afficionados.This book is one of the best!The story is almost mythical in style with Nancy saving her Father, Carson, from a  Tower!Fast-paced and intriguing, a truly exciting story.As for the racial  stereotypes, they can be maddening. I had to keep reminding myself that  times were different.The characterizations were a bit obvious, but after  all, this is a children's series written in a time before race issues were  hammered out.	1999-12-17

I am really enjoying reading the original Nancy Drew books that Applewood Publishers has been turning out.The illustrations by Russell Tandy are great!I read the whole series 20 years ago in grade school.Now I'm a  teacher and getting a kick out of collecting these books and rereading  them!The language from the 30's is hilarious.The language is dated, but a  scream to read these books. A real piece of Americana.If you loved these  books as a child, reread the originals, they are far superior.	1999-12-17

Both are equally good in my opinion. The characters, the setting, and the action draw youin, and you never want to leave!  A perfect novel to get kids into reading! I'm 33 and still love these great books.	1999-10-03

The characters, the setting, were all vibrant and real to life although the story took place long ago. It is not dated or stilted for today's  reader. I am reading up on children's lit for the upcoming school year.  I  will be teaching fifth grade.  The children will love this novel.  Very  creative, original, and a good tale of good vs. evil.  I plan to read  &quot;Jupiter&quot;, and I will hope that Ms. Furlong adds more to this  incredible series!	1999-08-05

It deals with difficult, but very real and raw emotions between siblings. The author Katerine Paterson is one of the best story tellers that young people of this generation can read and  understand. The story has everything! A tale of family relationships, and  rivalry between twins, set in the 1940's era in the Chesapeake Bay. I  enjoyed this book for it's dramatic intensity, fullness of the  characterizations, believability, and honest dealing with many teen issues.  Also, it took place in a locale that we don't usually read about.  I will  never forget these characters.  Paterson is a wonderful writer. I read this  book to catch up on children's lit for the age group I will be teaching  this coming school year. Fifth graders on up should really read this book.  They will certainly come away enriched. I discovered Paterson after reading  her riveting &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;, another must read.	1999-08-05

The illustrations are fantastic, and add to the magic of Yolen's writing.  A perfect pairing of author and illustrator.

I have never read anything quite like it before. Truly original in the rich characterizations, pacing, and story telling. I heartily recommend it. Judging by the other reviews, I  would have to say just read through this novel, don't get caught up in  answering everything along the way. It is a mystery! If you read it  strictly for the sheer enjoyment you will reap the benefits by being  thoroughly entertained. It is a difficult book, but just enjoy it. Smilla  is a terrific female character.  I, too, was impressed with the fact that  this literary character was created so realistically by a man! Hoeg  certainly has a talent to be savored, read, and enjoyed.	1999-06-26

As an American, I really thought it was intriquing to read about the continent of Australia by an Australian who had not ventured out in his country until his late 20's.  Condon's neurotic travel mannerisms are marked, and they can get on your  nerves after awhile, but it makes it all the more real-life. Read for  enjoyment of a good story rather than a travel guide to Australia, it is  enjoyable and funny. The drunken adventures of two Gen-Xers is really one  of a kind fun! I look forward to reading their adventures here in the  states. Now Sean, try to have a little more fun here, and leave the  neurotic stuff in Australia and have a ball here in the good old US of A!	1999-06-26

Perfect, I thought, for a gift.  Upon opening it this book I fell in love with the simplicity and the gorgeous illustrations.  Although  colorful, this is not merely a coffee table book for display. It is a  compact and uselful book. The information in this book is interesting, set  off by the magical illustrations.  However, the plants presented are not  your everyday garden variety!  An intersting and beautiful book.  By the  way, there was only one copy, so I bought it for myself...	1999-05-18

I first found out about the Cards of Illumination from a radio broadcast! The two authors were interviewed and explained how the sytem works clearly and simply.  It was fun.  The calls into the show were hilarious, because  all the callers were really &quot;pegged&quot;! Everyone who called in was  amazed, including me! Your birthdate corresponds to a card in a regular  deck of cards.  I was flabbergasted at how accurately I was described.   Anyway, I recommend the book!  It is a lot of fun, and easy to use. You can  look up your friends as well as romantic interests to check for  compatibility. The authors explain the system clearly and it is easy to  follow and understand.	1999-03-08
