Nobody visits Goldstone for pleasure, it's a place people go when there's nowhere else to go. But Maggie needs Brax. She's sure her husband Carl is having an affair and wants Brax to investigate.<br /><br />Brax's snooping leads to more questions than answers. For example, why is Carl exchanging e-mails with Simone Chandler, internet erotica author? Although Brax finds Simone deliciously desirable, he is still suspicious of her. Why is she living in Goldstone and why is she e-mailing his sister's husband? Brax wants to learn more about Simone, a lot more. But before he can, Carl is found murdered!<br /><br />I love a heroine I can relate to.  Simone is easy to connect with and immensely likable. She is voluptuous, smart, has a domineering mother, a fun sense of humor, and has lived<br /><br />through failure to try again. That Brax should find her fascinating is a given. Brax has known failure too, which makes him lovable but strong. He's clever, handsome, funny and<br /><br />very diplomatic. Their interaction is funny and sexy.<br /><br />Readers will enjoy Brax and Simone's love story but they will also be intrigued by Carl's activities, and later the mystery of his murder. Jennifer Skully has written Fool's Gold with<br /><br />plenty of plot twists and turns to keep the reader on edge wondering who the murderer could be. A  funny, smart mystery with a healthy dose of romance, Fool's Gold is a sure<br /><br />bet!<br /><br />Annabelle<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-10-13

Collis Tremayne, is determined to become a member of the Liar's Club, a secret government agency of spies.  At the top of his training class, Collis' only competition is the former house-maid Rose Lacey.  Rose is clever, brave, and seemingly immune to Collis' legendary charm.  As his frustration with Rose grows, so does his desire for her.<br /><br />When Rose Lacey is given the chance to better herself and become a spy for England's Liar's Club, she works tirelessly to meet the challenge.  Infuriated with the ease in which Collis achieves success and his arrogant confidence, Rose works even harder to best him while fighting her increasing attraction for her high-born competitor.<br /><br />When their rivalry gets out of hand, the pair are assigned a secret mission to test their skills and ability to work together.  Facing a dangerous threat to England's security, Collis and Rose must use all of their skills to outwit and thwart the enemy.  Can Collis and Rose work together without their tempers and passions exploding?<br /><br />I have read every book in the Liar's Club and enjoyed them all. The Charmer is no exception. Rose may be common by birth, but her driving desire to better herself makes her a strong, yet sympathetic, heroine. In addition, she has beauty, intelligence, and determination.  It's no wonder Collis is drawn to her.  Collis is charming, witty, and handsome. Despite his position in society, he doesn't let societal strictures rule his heart. These characters are a perfect balance for each other.<br /><br />I found the plot full of intrigue, the characters compelling, and the dialogue witty. I especially loved the amusing scenes involving the Prince Regent. Celeste Bradley does an excellent job of infusing sparkling humor into her books.<br /><br />While The Charmer can be read as a stand alone book, I would recommend reading the series in order. I love how character's from previous books cross over into The Charmer. A delightful read, I recommend The Charmer and the entire Liar's Club series.<br /><br />Annabelle<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewedcommend The Charmer and the entire Liar's Club series. <br /> <br /> <br />Annabelle <br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed <br />	2005-10-11

Olivia is poised, intelligent and has a marvelous sense of humor.  While Dane appreciates Olivia's cleverness, he also laments this very trait for she is constantly questioning things.  If he isn't careful, her curiosity and intellect will interfere with his latest mission, putting Olivia in terrible danger. Can the Lion protect his country and his heart?<br /><br />I love these characters and I love their story. Olivia is sweetly awkward and delightfully funny. I especially love her fearless interaction with Dane, although, there were times I wanted to shake him senseless and wished Olivia would do it for me. But I forgave him, how could I not? For Dane is dutiful, noble, and oh, so sinfully gorgeous. Dane has me so enthralled that I am still drooling over him.<br /><br />Surrender to a Wicked Spy is a keeper!

Several months ago, Tess, a computer analyst, helped Nash save his best friend and colleague Decker from a potential hit.  With the adrenaline running high and eyes wide open, Nash and Tess had a one night stand after all was said and done.  Now, they are part of a team sent to Kazbekistan to help recover a laptop with enough information that could put a major dent in the fight against terrorism.  Can these two work together or will their attraction get them killed?<br /><br />Flashpoint is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller set in Kazbekistan.  Nash is a bad ass agent who plays hard and works harder.  His nonchalant attitude has gotten him in trouble more than once.  In the case of Tess, his best friend Decker has some feelings for her that Nash either fails to realize or can't resist.  It's an interesting subplot of two friends attracted to the same woman.  At first, I didn't know who I wanted to root for, but as the plot thickened Nash seemed to be the better choice despite his dark side.  He has enough personal issues to fill a book, but with Tess he shows a softer edge.  He begins to care about her as a person rather than a potential lay or fellow agent.  The moments of tenderness he shows made me realize he is a good man.  He just doesn't know how to express himself.  He has been an agent for so long that I don't think he knows how to be anything else.  It's like he doesn't know where his life as an agent ends and he, as a person, begins.<br /><br />Tess is an awesome computer analyst, but a green field agent.  On her first assignment, she is out of her element.  In Kazbekistan, she sees the worst that reality has to offer but still remains upbeat.  Her optimism was a breath of fresh air even in the darkest times.  I admired her stubbornness and love for Nash because she could see the person he could be under all of the arrogance and attitude.  Yet she would not ask for more than what he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.  It was all or nothing for her.<br /><br />Flashpoint is my first Suzanne Brockmann book, but definitely not my last.  The characters are richly detailed and flawed.  Tess, Nash and the secondary characters are real.  Under the harshest conditions, they do and see things that would make a normal person cringe.  I was riveted by the story and all of the subplots that were seamlessly interwoven throughout the book.  Each one helped drive the story, not diminishing the overall storyline.  I could not stop reading because I needed to know what happened next.  I hope each of the secondary characters will have their own story because they are so fascinating.  Flashpoint is a wonderful thriller that will keep you riveted until the last page.<br /><br />Lee<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewedhat he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.

He and Sue, his human mate, have been given new identities and relocated by the Sazi to Chicago.  There they are attempting to adjust to pack life.  Other than being furry once a month and craving red meat, Tony's adjustments include his newfound ability to see other people's memories by simply touching them.  The Sazi call this  \\"hindsight.\\"<br /><br />Tony's old Mafia boss, Carmine Leone, hires him to find his kidnapped lover Babs,  an Alpha werewolf.  According to Wolven Security Chief Lucas, she isn't the first Sazi female to be reported missing.  As if Carmine's demands aren't enough, the world leaders of the shapeshifter clans have converged on Chicago in order to train Tony in the use of his new \\"gift.\\"<br /><br />Sure, piece of cake!  He just has to find Babs, keep the pack leader from ripping his face off because Tony doesn't play well with others, and solve the mystery of the missing Sazi females....nothing to it!  All Tony really wants to do is grab Sue, find the closest secluded  horizontal surface and spend some quality time with his mate.  These pack problems are really getting to be a pain!<br /><br />Although Moon's Web starts out slowly,  it is an excellent continuation of the Sazi series.  It is a bit frustrating when the authors hinted at situations that occurred in the first book without giving full explanations. However, the heat between secondary characters Bobby and Asri keeps the story moving along at an even pace.  My imagination got quite a full workout with the eclectic mix of shapeshifters.  I wasn't certain how the authors could gather that mix into a cohesive law enforcement unit, but they did a wonderful job.  I highly recommend that you read Hunter's Moon first to avoid confusion of characters and plotlines. Oh, the villain of the story?  Well, read Moon's Web and be amazed!<br /><br />Monique<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-10-11

The Night Before Christmas is an anthology featuring six wonderful stories. There wasn't a single story in this book that I didn't enjoy. Truly a book that captures the magic of the Christmas season my single complaint has to be that the stories left me wanting more!<br /><br />Lori Foster's White Knight Christmas is the first story. For months, Police Detective Parker Ross has watched his neighbor Lily Donaldson, watched and wanted her. But Lily is everything he thinks he shouldn't have. She's too sweet, too optimistic, too young and too into Christmas. But Lily's not giving up on Parker and before long he finds himself falling head over heels. With a hunky hero and a spunky, determined  heroine, White Knight Christmas is another wonderful treat from Lori Foster.<br /><br />Snowed Under by Erin McCarthy was my favorite tale in this anthology! When Claire Robbins is soaked by a passing snow plow she heads to her brothers place to try and dry out only to find that while her brother and his wife are out of town his best friend Justin Fairbanks is staying at his apartment. Claire has been attracted to Justin for years but never acted on it but now that she's got him trapped right where she wants him she's determined she's going to have him, if only for one night. For his part, Justin has wanted Claire for years also, but has always felt bad about it because she was in college when he first met her and the age difference made him feel just wrong. With Claire taking off her clothes in an attempt to get warm and letting him know in no uncertain terms that she wants him and has wanted him for years he doesn't stand a chance. But will they both realize that the feelings that they've had for each other for years may go beyond attraction and lust? When I first read Claire's brother Derek's story, Smart Mouth, I was hoping that Erin McCarthy would do a story for Claire and I certainly wasn't disappointed! Snowed Under is a hot little tale that is loaded with emotion.<br /><br />In Ms. Humbug by Jill Shalvis, Cami Bennett has never felt like she fit in. She used to be the ugly duckling in a family of swans before she went to college and although she lost weight and has become attractive she can't seem to see herself in any other light except the one she grew up under.

Mayor Matt Tarino has been attracted to Cami for awhile now but once they share a kiss he knows that he is going to have to prove to Cami that he is not the skirt chaser that everyone thinks he is. A sensual tale with just right touch of suspense Ms. Humbug is a welcome addition to this anthology!<br /><br />Kathy Love gives us a story about second chances with I'll Be Home For Christmas. When he is stranded at the airport due to snow storm the last thing Rob Marsten expects to see is Erica Fetzer, the woman that he had dumped years ago but had never really forgotten, or that due the storm he would find himself sharing a hotel room with her.

But Rob begins to wonder if money and success are worth it if you have no one to share it with. Can he convince Erica to give him another chance? Kathy Love has penned an outstanding short story of realizing what's really important in life.<br /><br />The final story in this book was The Good Girl's Guide To A Very Bad Christmas by Kylie Adams.

The Black Dagger Brotherhood is an elite group of vampires working together to defend their dwindling race and rid the world of their enemy, The Lessers. Their leader, Wrath, the only purebred vampire in existence, has a personal vendetta against The Lessening Society. They killed his parents. His sole focus for centuries has been the eradication of this deadly menace.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Because of the potency of Wrath's purebred blood, Darius, a member of The Brotherhood, asks Wrath to aid his daughter through her transition. Transition occurs in vampires in their mid-twenties and blood from vampires of the opposite sex is needed. Any vampire that does not complete their transition, dies.

A widow of two years, Passion Elizabeth Dare Redington is in London to help prepare for her young cousin's coming out.  Raised by her father, a widowed vicar, duty and obligation have defined her life.  Still young and beautiful, Passion has resigned herself to a life without a man's love.  She once dreamed of an intimate connection with her husband, but the harsh reality of her loveless marriage smothered all such hope.  Her late husband's cruel indifference, both physical and emotional, sent Passion into a shell of restrained propriety.  On a visit to the Crystal Palace, Passion is shocked out of this lonely cocoon.<br /><br />Saved from a falling palm tree by a beautiful stranger, Passion's dormant desire is awakened.  His bold handling should offend her, but she is strangely drawn to this sensual man as his discrete pursuit continues throughout the exhibitions.  Finally, the two desperate strangers abandon themselves behind a screen.  Exchanging only first names, there is no mistake they are there simply to sate their sensual appetites.  Passion discovers a lust and desire she thought not to exist.  Even though she knows it should be a one time encounter, she agrees to meet him again.<br /><br />Mark Randolph Hawkmore, Earl of Langley, has come to the Crystal Palace to meet with a lady.  While in the china exhibit, he encounters a most captivatingly sensual woman.  Too bad it is not Charlotte Lawrence, whom he is supposed to be meeting, the woman his mother is pressuring him to marry.  Fascinated by this stranger's seductive beauty and obvious interest, he gives into temptation.  Mark's interlude with Passion leaves him overwhelmed and wanting more.<br /><br />Other than sexual satisfaction, Mark has had scarce use for women.  This is of little surprise, as he grew up with a vicious and unfaithful mother.  Unhappy with her unwanted husband, Mark was always an easy target for her resentment.  All her love and affection has been reserved for her younger son, Matthew.  Best friends and brothers, there is nothing Mark would not do for Matthew.  However, when one of his mother's past indiscretions leads to a blackmail plot, the strength of this bond is tested.  Mark is being forced to marry Charlotte in order to save Matthew from a devastating scandal.  Hurting his brother is out of the question, but he does not want to marry Charlotte.  All he wants is more Passion. As much as he can get.<br /><br />I was totally overwhelmed by Passion!  Expecting a typical historical in which most sensuality is flowery and overwrought, I was pleasantly surprised with this explicit and erotic story.  Don't let the sizzling hot sex fool you though, as there is much more to offer.  Passion and Mark become more than just sexual partners.  As their relationship grows, so do the obstacles to their happiness.  Although not easily tied up, the resolution is very satisfying.  I liked that Passion was strong and not a weak, romantic girl.  She finds joy in what Mark offers, but does not let her love compromise her principles.  Although selfish at first, Mark grows and becomes a true man, a man worthy of Passion.  What begins as an erotic adventure becomes a poignant love story.  I loved Passion!

While running for her life through the Amazon jungle, Grace Carlyle accidently finds herself running through a portal that leads to another world. She soon discovers that Atlantis is more than just a myth. Plus, it's inhabited by shape-shifting dragons. Darius en Kragin is the leader of this people and the Guardian of this particular portal. His duty is to kill any traveler who comes through the gate, a duty that he has never failed at, until he sees Grace.<br /><br />For some reason he can't bring himself to kill her. Instead, he imprisons her in his palace. Darius tells himself that it's only because he needs to find out where Grace got the dragon<br /><br />necklace that she's wearing. When Grace manages to escape, Darius goes after her.  In the process of getting her back, he discovers that there is a conspiracy between humans and vampires to take over Atlantis and steal it's wealth. A conspiracy which has already claimed the life of Darius's mentor, leaving control of the other portal in human and vampire hands. Now Darius has to come to grips with his feelings for Grace and wrest control of the portal from the invaders.<br /><br />Heart of the Dragon is a paranormal romance lovers dream. It has it all: vampires, shape-shifting dragons, Atlantis, sexy love scenes, and emotional intensity. Within the first 3 pages, I cared about Darius and wanted his happiness.  I didn't stop rooting for him until the story was over. Grace is spunky without being grating, and was the perfect heroine for<br /><br />Darius.

Steele is in jail serving 25 years in an Army prison for shooting at his commanding officer.  Considering that his commander is still alive, he should count his lucky stars because Steele is one of the best snipers around.  He doesn't miss unless it's on purpose!  Now he has an opportunity to use the \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" card but there is a catch.  He needs to help find and disable a fellow sniper before he kills a powerful politician. The clock is ticking and time is running out.<br /><br />BAD agent Sydney Westbrook is a no-nonsense agent whose luscious curves and Angelina Jolie-like looks make it difficult for her to be taken seriously.  Now she has a chance to make her case and save the world from chaos by working with Steele.  All they have to do is stay alive, fight their physical attraction and find the other sniper before it is too late.<br /><br />BAD Attitude is the first full length BAD novel by Ms. Kenyon.  It has non-stop action and suspense mixed in with some hot attraction and sex appeal.  Steele is a hardened man who has pretty much lost everything.  He is basically expendable because no one will miss him if he fails. I can't imagine living alone with no emotional support, but I admire his dedication to Sydney and his friend Jake.  Steele is a strong man who just lost his way, but this assignment helps him to at least find himself again and open himself to the possibilities of love.<br /><br />Sydney is a rather unconventional agent who seems to bumble the assignment, causing Steele more problems than what it's worth.  She just doesn't get that sometimes life doesn't always follow the book.  I didn't like how she totally dismissed Steele's opinions or thoughts.  However, I do believe that Sydney brought out the good inside Steele.  He came alive when he was with her.  The secondary characters play a very important part in their story, not just on the assignment, but helping to shape their relationship.  The twists and turns in BAD Attitude made it difficult to put down.  I couldn't even figure out who the other sniper was and was honestly shocked when the person was unmasked.  I truly enjoyed BAD Attitude and I can't wait to read Sherrilyn Kenyon's next installment in the BAD series.<br /><br />Lee<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Revieweditude made it difficult to put down.

He is very amused and decides to answer her by writing an smoldering scene of his own from the hero Reides's point of view. Their emails sizzle with the erotic scenes they send back and forth.<br /><br />When Tessa gets the story almost completed, she wants to get the book published. There is only one drawback. She must get Cole Granger to agree to allow them to publish the book. Cole has his own agenda and wants Tessa no matter what the cost. Cole doesn't care that she has a less than sterling reputation that would upset his parents. Cole plays hardball, telling Tessa that they must act out the first scene from the book in real life. He as Reides as she takes the role of Alina. The setting is very intense and their attraction to each other becomes a smoldering sea of lust and passion. Will Tessa get Cole to agree to publish this book? Is there a future for Tessa and Cole?<br /><br />Julie Elizabeth Leto's Making Waves is a very enjoyable tale for anyone who loves highly sensual stories.

She is also up to her ears in debt. So much so that she has to \\"moonlight\\" as a waitress at a local pizza parlor to make ends meet. A girl has got to pay the bills but she also risks her social credibility. When her rival, Vanessa, finds out about Jane's side job, Jane loses her boyfriend Dean. Payback is a bitch and Jane sets out to steal Vanessa's man. Who cares if she is still in love with Dean as long as she wins? But will Jane lose more in the end?<br /><br />Fierce Competition is an erotic version of Sex and the City. Jane is a successful woman with a shopping addiction. Rather than borrow from her rich friends or boyfriend, she decides to get a job as a waitress. I admired her for taking responsibility rather than leech off her friends. Yet when she thinks she loses her boyfriend Dean, her school girl persona emerges. Rather than deal with him about his feelings, Jane plots her revenge and decides to steal Vanessa's boyfriend. My first thought was to scream, \\"Oh my goodness girlfriend. Why don't you ask him how he feels about you?\\" She just assumed that Dean broke up with her, which is just wrong. It was like her maturity level dropped by a few years and she was in high school again. I couldn't understand her logic, but I could empathize with her need to hurt Vanessa as deeply as she was hurt.<br /><br />Dean is a lawyer and a Senator's son. His father believes that it is bad politics to be dating a waitress during an election year. However Dean could care less, because he loves Jane. Besides, he doesn't believe she is a waitress. Through misunderstandings and innuendoes, Dean and Jane wind up alone. I was irritated with Dean because he seemed so easily distracted by sex rather than talking to Jane. He's supposed to be a good talker since he is a lawyer, but instead he acts like a sexaholic. It takes losing Jane to make him see the light. She is more than just a bed partner. She is his life partner. When they finally got serious, their maturity shined through and showed how this whole situation would make them stronger individually, and as a couple, if only they would communicate.<br /><br />All of the secondary characters in Fierce Competition are a hoot, and play a major role in shaping Dean and Jane's relationship. Like all friends, they each have their own opinions, but also have their own personal relationships to deal with. I enjoyed the fact that each of the characters found something unexpected and deeper than anything they had ever experienced before. I really admired how Ms. Pillow interweaves all these different relationships into the story, but never once was I confused or distracted during the transitions.

A publicist to sports stars, she works in the family firm \\"The Hot Zone\\".  Although she has always been more of tomboy, she's getting tired of always being seen as \\"one of the guys\\". Especially by Damian Fuller, the handsome major league ball player that she has been fantasizing about for a while. So her sister Sophie gives her a make over and \\"girl\\" lessons.<br /><br />Damian has been attracted to Micki for awhile, even before her make over, but now it's getting harder and harder for him to deny the attraction between them. Even worse, Micki is not the sort of woman he normally goes out with. He knows that she's not the love `em and leave `em type. But no matter how much he tells himself to stay away from her, he can't seem to stop himself. When a jealous team mate of Damian's sets them up for a media scandal, Micki and Damian find themselves hiding out together away from the public eye. Before long the sexual tension between them overcomes all of Damian's good intentions and they fall into an affair. But when they return to the real world Damian is faced with the shocking information that an ex-fling is claiming that Damian is the father of her child. He needs Micki's skills as a publicist and her support as a friend. But once the crisis is over, can Damian convince Miki that he wants her in his life permanently?<br /><br />Hot Number is the second book of what appears to be three books featuring the Jordan sisters. I had read the first book, Hot Stuff, about Annabelle Jordan and truly enjoyed it. When Micki's story became available, I grabbed it and devoured it in one sitting. Damian is a wonderful hero, dealing with the end of his career and yet not quite ready to let go. Micki is dealing with her own insecurities. Together they work, but neither is prepared to step out and take a chance. Hot Number was engrossing from page one.

All her life Sarah has known she was different. She just didn't know why. After her parents death, Sarah was sent to live with her<br />psychotic grandmother, often referred to in her town as \\"That Bitch\\". Her grandmother refused to let anyone of Sarah's \\"pack\\" tell her the truth... that Sarah is actually a werewolf. Her friendship with humans Miki and Angelina is the steady point in her life. When werewolf Zach Sheridan shows up in town, Sarah is attracted to him and suddenly feels all these strange new changes in her body.<br /><br />Zach Sheridan was sent by the Alpha of the Magnus Pack to check on Sarah. Sarah's mother and father were once Alphas of the Magnus Pack and the Pack wants to be sure that Sarah is prepared for the changes coming. Zach is one werewolf who doesn't want a<br />mate, but when he meets Sarah something about her calls to him. It doesn't take long for them to tear the clothes off each other.<br /><br />Now Sarah has to face what she is. Once she does, it doesn't take her long to decide that if she's going to be a werewolf, then she's going to be an Alpha just like her mother.<br />Therefore, Sarah faces challenging the current female Alpha. Then there's a pesky intrusion from the Whitelaw Pride of lion shifters, who are determined to kill Sarah for revenge against her mother for killing one of their own. Sarah's got a lot on her plate! It's a good thing she's got Zach to help her, along with her best friends Miki and Angelina.<br /><br />The second book in Magnus Heat is 'Go Fetch!' This story features Miki Kendrick. Miki is a bit of a wild child. Barred from several states for life, and watched by the FBI, Miki is a<br />genuine genius. Evil genius, of course.<br /><br />Conall is Zach's best friend. From the moment he saw Miki, Conall has been intent on having her. Miki is having no part of that, but when she goes to stay with Sarah and the Magnus Pack, Miki is thrown into constant contact with Conall. When it appears as though the Hyenas are going after Miki in order to get to Sarah, Conall decides that he's not letting Miki get out of his sight.

When the Hyenas attack in force and Conall is injured, Miki realizes just how deeply she feels about him.<br /><br />I can say, with all honesty, that Shelly Laurenston's Magnus Heat is one of the funniest books that I have read in long time.

Kelly and Tom hadn't seen each other since the failed wedding, but now it appears as though someone is killing the members of the wedding party. Kelly and Tom are thrown back together while trying to figure out who the murder is before they are next.<br /><br />As they hunt for a killer, Kelly and Tom discover that the feelings between them have never gone away. Now that there is no wedding to prevent them from acting on their feelings, can they finally find their way to each other and survive the murderer who has targeted them?<br /><br />Although I have read several serial Harlequins by Kathleen O'Brien, I have to say this longer novel is, by far, her best offering yet. While the Mellon family is almost too dysfunctional, they add just the right amount of twist to the plot. Tom and Kelly finding each other again is the best part of the story.

Life and love are never easy for these two.<br /><br />A Match Made In Scandal is a story of two friends who are seeing each other in a different light after years apart. Ryan is so focused on his business and his daughter, that he doesn't have time for love. He is marrying to help secure his business. When he sees Rachel again, all of his old feelings resurface. I could see him start to change from a ruthless businessman to someone who found love is worth more than money. Rachel is way ahead of her time. She is not only educated but owns part of a successful small company. Despite her success, she is not taken seriously, except by her grandmother and close friends. However, that doesn't stop her from going head to head with Ryan. Her ingenuity and generous heart certainly give Ryan a run for his money.<br /><br />The characteristics that attract Rachel and Ryan to each other, also seem to drive them crazy at some point. Even though Ryan's ambition and drive are admirable, I feel like he was disillusioned by it all. Everything was about the next dollar or deal. He was becoming too cynical and hard. On the other hand, Rachel was a bit too idealistic. What a wake up call it was for her to see that life isn't always the way she planned. In spite of their opposite views on their business, I could see flashes of admiration through out the book. They had a camaraderie and familiarity that was difficult to miss.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Ms. Thomas weaved the past and present so seamlessly throughout A Match Made In Scandal. I didn't feel bogged down or bored at any part. When Rachel's past comes back to haunt her and Ryan sees he could lose her again, it finally pushes him into taking action to get what he wants. The chemistry between the two was hot. It combined the familiar past with their new-found feelings to create a love that is unique. Overall, A Match Made in Scandal shows that you can find an everlasting love in old friends.<br /><br />Lee<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewedf their opposite views on their business, I could see flashes of admiration through out the book.

What do you do when you're a dentist who can't stand the sight of blood? In Shanna Whelan's case, you work the graveyard shift in an emergency dental clinic. In the six weeks she's worked there, Shanna has seen one patient, and no blood was involved.<br /><br />What do you do when you're an immortal vampire who's lost a fang? Roman Draganesti faces the horrific fate of becoming a lopsided eater for all eternity, unless his fang is replaced before morning. So, what else can he do but look in the vampire Black Pages for a dentist?<br /><br />Unfortunately for Roman, it seems there are no undead orthodontists. He has no choice but to go to a mortal. What do you do when the mortal you've chosen has a mob contract on her head? You promise to protect her, of course! This decision by Roman causes a ripple effect upon vampires and mortals alike. A vampire hit man, a secret formula, and a CIA stake-out team, make for a very bumpy ride on the road to eternal love.<br /><br />How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire is the first book I've read by Kerrelyn Sparks and it was laugh-out-loud funny! The scene after Roman loses his fang is eye-wiping hilarious. A bored immortal, a phobic dentist, a lot of sparks, and you've got a recipe for a great read! I highly recommend this book to all the vampire lovers out there.<br /><br />Delia<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-09-06

When Colleen MacGregor pulled Sebastian Ware out of a ditch in a snow storm she thought she had saved a drunk from certain death. However, once she got him out of the cold and into her home she discovered that he had been struck on his head and left to die in the snow. With a storm raging outside Colleen has no choice but to allow Sebastian to stay at her home and, since he is injured, she set him up in her bedroom. She never expected to find herself compromised and forced to marry Sebastian when the local vicar stops by to check on her. Colleen and Sebastian are already wed when they get the startling news that Sebastian's cousin has died leaving him the new Earl of Penwyth. Suddenly Colleen is a Countess and on her way to London with a new husband she barely knows but finds herself coming to have feelings for. But Sebastian had sworn never to marry again after the nightmare his first marriage was and most certainly never to allow a woman to into his heart again. Sebastian and Colleen quickly find themselves falling in love but when Sebastian's mysterious enemy sets their sights on Colleen, can Sebastian figure out who is behind these mysterious attacks before it's too late?<br /><br />I have read all of Melissa Schroeder's past releases and enjoyed them but with The Accidental Countess she outdoes herself. The emotional connection between Sebastian and Colleen is so richly woven that the reader finds themselves enthralled waiting for them to have the happy ending they so deserve. As I have said in the past, Melissa Schroeder's books have been entertaining reading but if The Accidental Countess is an example of what we can expect in the future then Melissa Schroeder's future looks bright indeed.<br /><br />Melissa<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-09-01

With one look, the normally isolated Walker feels an immediate sexual and emotional connection to congressional staffer Lindsay Fleming.

The couple race to hone their newfound skills while uncovering a massive government conspiracy involving murder, mind control, psychic gifts, biological warfare, and genetic engineering.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. York's previous books in the the Moon series.  With Beyond Control she reaches a new intensity that drew me in and would not let go.  The idea of two lonely, solitary people discovering an ultra-human bond that is profoundly sexual, yet so much more, resonated with me.  Seeing Lindsay and Jordan deal with the conflict between their former isolation and their new closeness was compelling.  Even so, their relationship is not the only story.  At first it seems as if there are several unrelated threads.

But a little dose of Pardee goes a long way and no matter what it takes Josie is determined that's not going to let herself get involved with Pardee again, especially since Skylar is waiting for her at home.<br /><br />As a heroine Josie was awesome. She's a spirted and self reliant woman that I believe readers will truly enjoy. However, I had real issues with the hero, Pardee. I never really felt like his infidelity was addressed so the romance fell a little flat for me. Running on Empty was written in the first person which I believe in this instance may have contributed to my inability to feel remorse or redemption from Pardee. This left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied with the romantic ending of the book. I'll say this for Lynn Montana, she knows how to write a kick butt heroine and readers won't be disappointed if they read this book for Josie alone.<br /><br />Melissa<br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-07-19

I review a lot books along with reading many books just for the pleasure of reading but rarely do I come across a book that is so good that I find myself re-reading as soon as I turned the last page. Elizabeth Vaughan has so skillfully drawn Xylara's world and the characters that inhabit it that you find yourself  throughly engrossed.  The sensuality of this book is very low but the reader quickly finds that the romance and storyline are so well woven that even lovers of sensual romance, such as myself, will find that they don't even miss it. Warprize is the first is what is to be a trilogy of books featuring the Warlord and his Warprize and I, for one, will be waiting impatiently.<br /><br />Melissa<br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-06-30

For almost 10 years Jamie has been living as a recluse in the mountains of North Carolina. He makes occasional appearances in Visitation, the closest town. Although he pretty much keeps to himself, lately he has found himself developing friendships with some of the people in Visitation which makes him uncomfortable. So when a woman suddenly appears on his mountain looking for him he's not sure how to handle it. Faith was sent to find Jamie and help him, although with what she's not sure yet. Faith knew Jamie years ago before the betrayal that had sent him into seclusion. Although Jamie had never noticed her back then she has always loved him. Jamie's unsure about trusting Faith but before long they find themselves involved in a passionate relationship and falling in love. But when the past suddenly comes back to haunt them can they both survive? Maybe with a little help from Jamie's friends in Visitation.<br /><br />I have long been a fan of Lori Foster. Her books have a place of honor on my keeper shelf. With so many mainstream romance authors seemingly  moving away from their fan bases it is such a wonderful treat to pick up a book by an author that you love and get what you expected. A sensual well told romance that grabs your attention, won't let you put it down until it over and leaves you wishing that it was longer because you weren't ready to stop reading. Readers of the Visitation stories have long waited for Jamie's story and they won't be disappointed. A sexy tortured hero, a heroine determined to help him, secrets which keep you engrossed waiting to find out what's happening, lots of help from the characters from the other Visitation books and the conclusion of Alyx and Scott's story make this book a must read for Lori Foster fans.<br /><br />Melissa<br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed<br />[...]	2005-05-21

Tearach Bruce knows that his race is facing extinction but when the Sorceress of the Ancients tells him that by mating with a human woman and conceiving a child the curse destroying his people will be lifted. Tearach can't believe that he is expected to mate with a human, one of the very people who are responsible for the destruction of his people. Kathy Parker is a paramedic whose has lost both her father and her fianc&eacute; in a fire. The last thing she ever expected was to be kidnaped and told that she must mate with a Goblin in order to save his race. Both Tearach and Kathy are determined that they will not be forced into a relationship. But neither of them count on the Sorceress's determination for them to conceive a child. With a little help from the Sorceress Tearach and Kathy find themselves spending a passion filled night together and a child is conceived. Tearach is convinced that this child will more than likely die as soon as it is born like the other Goblin children but Kathy is just as determined that Tearach will let go of the hate and gloominess that has filled his life. Once their child is born will Tearach be able to let go of the past and give his heart to Kathy? Or will a woman who is obsessed with Tearach destroy all the good that has Kathy has brought.<br /><br />I have to say that Goblin Moon was a huge surprise for me. I love fantasy and paranormal romances but I put off reading Goblin Moon because I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I was happily surprised when I found that I could not put it down. Tearach is a hero who you feel for even when you want to shake him. Kathy is just the sort of heroine that I love to read. Spunky and able to take care of herself. Together Tearach and Kathy simmer with emotion and heat. Candace Sams skillfully drew me into the world of the Druids, Goblins and Fairies.

The Lombard/SAS series have been among some of my favorite books and I often find myself re-reading them. They were that good. I was anxiously awaiting Touching Midnight and had pre-ordered it as soon as that option became available. But I am sorry to say that I found it to be a disappointment. One of the trade marks of any Fiona Brand book has been the sizzling sensuality of the love scenes, a trade mark that was sadly missing in Touching Midnight. The central love scene probably last about half a page. Also, knowing that Jay Lomax was actually Jake Lombard I was eagerly anticipating the reunion of Gray, Blade and Roma with their lost brother. After all it was Jake's \\"death\\" that was the catalyst  for their stories. Instead the reunion was about two sentences long. It is with a heavy keyboard that I write this review and sadly say to all Fiona Brand fans that Touching Midnight is probably one Lombard story that you will want to give a miss. If you haven't had a chance to read Fiona Brand I would suggest that you try Cullen's Bride, Heart of Midnight, Blade's Lady or Marrying MaCabe to get a true feel for Fiona Brand.<br /><br />Melissa<br />Reviewed for Joyfully ReviewedHeart of Midnight, Blade's Lady or Marrying MaCabe to get a true feel for Fiona Brand.

The victim is one of the members of her club, Great Bods who had taken to dressing like Blair. In fact she was so good at it that she could easily been mistaken for Blair. Lt. Wyatt Bloodworth dumped Blair cold two years ago after only three dates without any explaination or phone call. When he hears that a blond woman was murdered at her club his first thought is that it was Blair so he rushes over to the club. Upon discovering that Blair is fine he decides that he wants a second chance with her and that he is going to protect her. No matter if Blair wants him to or not. Let me say that I love Linda Howard's books. To Die For is a certain improvement from her last two books. It's more lighthearted(think Mr. Perfect). However it's also not as sexy as any of her previous books, which I really missed. One of the reasons I buy LH books is for the sensuality. To Die For was also written in the first person which is something I never expected from LH.<br />Let me say this again, I love LH but her last few books just have not been as good as her older works. To me they are just missing something. But To Die For is certainly going back in the right direction after the big disapointments I found her last two books to be. There were some parts that were truly hilarious but I had issues with the way that Wyatt dumped Blair 2 years ago so I had a hard time warming up to him and that detracted from the story for me. But after I've said all this I still think everyone will enjoy it. I have to say that I think the only reason I was somewhat unsatisfied at all with To Die For is because Linda Howard had me soooo spoiled by her other stuff that I keep waiting for another Shades of Twilight or After The Night or a hero like Zane or Chance MacKenzie.	2004-12-30

Her books are loaded with steamy, erotic love scenes. But unlike many authors who write romantica(erotic romance) the highly erotic nature of the book does not distract from the romance or the storyline of the book. However, readers who are not comfortable with books that have non-traditional love scenes will probably not like this book but those who are looking for a lushly sensual story will do well to give The Hunters a try, you won't be disappointed.*****	2004-12-30

I LOVED Body Check and so when this book came out I ran to the store to pick it up. Although it was nice read it wasn't as good as Body Check. It just didn't have the romance or spunky fun as the first book. I'll still be looking forward to reading this author in the future but I have to admit that after a stellar premier with Body Check, Deirdre Martin kind of disappointed me with Fair Play.	2004-08-30

I had never had the pleasure of reading any of Diane Whiteside's ebooks so she was pretty much an unknown to me. Several people recommended this book to me so I bought it without even knowing the storyline. I'm so glad that I did.  I enjoyed it so much that I immdiately went to find her ebooks and purchased them.  I love finding new authors and I'll be waiting for Diane Whiteside's next book!!	2004-08-20

Don't get me wrong, Kiss Me While I Sleep was a nice afternoon's read but not what I've come to expect from Linda Howard's books. Kiss Me While I Sleep and Linda Howard's previous book, Cry No More were very much darker than previous Linda Howard books and I don't mean that in a good way. There was a time when I would pre-order a book just because Linda Howard's name was on the cover now I think I'm going to wait for the paperback instead of paying Hardback prices. Linda Howard always did such wonderful romances but the current shift in her writing to \\"romantic\\" suspense is a change not for the better in my opinion. In fact, it seems to me that several romance writers are changing their writing and as a romance fan it makes me wonder if these authors are ashamed to write romance and so are trying to move away from it? Mr. Perfect, Shades of Twilight(one of my personal favorites!), After the Night, Dream Man, Now You See Her and Open Season along with almost all of her earlier romance books are on my keeper shelf. I hope that Ms. Howard will bring back the romance in her books and move away from what she's doing now because I sure miss her writing!	2004-08-14

I went to the library and Calder Promise was on the new bookshelf. Being a glutton for punishment and since it was raining I decided to read it. It must be a formula for Janet Dailey! Add new characters, kill off beloved ones. Does she use the same outline for every book? I loved the first three Calder books and Cat's book so I think that's why it so upsets me the way Janet Dailey kills off a Calder in every book. In this book it made no sense at all to me when she killed off Logan Echohawk. It didn't even seem plot driven which is why I say the Calder books have almost become an outline of the book that came before. Laura, Ty and Jessie's daughter, who was the center of this book is torn between two love intrests. I couldn't get involved with Laura or her men because you know once you marry a Calder it's just about certain that either you or your spouse will die from unnatural causes in a future book!	2004-07-05

I bought this book without really looking at the storyline because Sharon Sala's name was on the book. What a mistake that was! I HATE writing a negative review so I have to really be disappointed to write one. This book is a total departure from what made me love Sharon Sala as an author. I have always looked Sharon Sala's romances but I could never get into this book. It was more like Historical Chick Lit. There was no &quot;happy ending&quot; that romance lovers look for. In fact, I couldn't find any real romance in this book. It's just my opinion but I believe when an author puts out a book that is so different from what her fans have come to expect from her that a pen name would probably be the way to go. Instead I was left feeling cheated by one of my favorite authors because now I can never have Sharon Sala on autobuy again. Also, I feel slightly insulted as a romance fan. I have noticed a trend by several romance writers to change their format. As a fan it makes me wonder are they ashamed to write romance?	2004-06-21

The main character sleeps with someone other than the hero? I wasn't sure I wanted to read the book and be disappointed! I put it on my bookshelf to be read later, after about 3 months I decided what the heck! I'll give it a try! I'm sure glad I did. Nell's husband suddenly leaves her on Christmas day. She's stunned! Not only was he her husband of 20 years but he was also her boss. So, she not only lost her husband but she also lost her job! Finally she's trying to put her life back together and she gets a job at McKenna's detective agency. Gabe McKenna is the hero of this book and his best friend Riley is his partner in the agency. Before Nell and Gabe get together she has a one night stand with Riley. Strangly enough I could totally understand this! Riley is gorgeous! He's years younger than Nell. Nell's husband left her for a younger woman, she's feeling really lousy about herself and here is this gorgeous younger man who wants to sleep with her. Gabe and Nell weren't involved yet and it certainly made for very a humorous situation in when they all met up with Nell's ex-husband. As to Gabe's relationship with his ex-wife. That ends very quickly in the beginning of the book and Nell has been working for the agency for a day or so when Gabe and Chloe are over. All in all I laughed myself silly numerous times and the issues that some of the other reviews found undesirable I found made perfect sense in the context of the book. I'm glad I took it off my shelf and gave it a chance!	2004-04-25

I was waiting for Rees and Helene's story but once I read it found that it just lacked....something. I was intrigued by the chemistry between Rees and Helene but was bothered by the romance between Rees's brother and Rees's mistress. I felt like Eliosa James spent too much time on that love story rather than devoting more of the time to Rees and Helene and that made the story somewhat lacking.	2004-04-07

I've read many Rachel Lee books that I have truly enjoyed but I just could never get involved in this book.

So, left with 5 hours to kill in the middle of the Atlanta airport I went to the bookstore and picked up this book. I was enthralled! I had never read Stephanie Laurens before. I spent the whole 5 hours sitting at my gate reading this book!! I never took a break! The book was sensual and fun! Others have wrote very nice storylines so I won't do that but I will say that I enjoyed this book so much that as soon as I got home I ordered all the rest in Stephanie Lauren's Cynster series and her new Bastion Club series!!!	2004-03-07

I have loved all of the Cynster novels but I just couldn't get into this one. Knowing that Sebastian is going to be unfaithful to Helena in the future made me unable to get into the book. I mean how can you credit happily ever after when the hero has a child with someone else? That ruined the book for me. I'm with one of the other reveiwers who said that Stephanie Laurens should have had Richard's mother drug Sebastian as Catroina did Richard. That would at least had made the cheating understandable AND made this book something worth reading! All those who love the Cynster novels would do well to give this one a miss.	2004-03-06

When I read some of the other reviews I was unsure if I wanted to buy the book. I took a chance and was happily suprised! I felt for both Christina and Varek through out the entire book. The author did a very good job in making me both angry at Varek and feel for him at the sametime. The only thing that kept me from giving this book a 5 was the ending. The ending was good but a little abrupt and I thought it would have been very nice for the author to give us a glimpse into the Christina and Varek's future. All in all it was a good story which I am glad I took the time to read!	2004-01-27

Let me start off by saying that this book was extremely well written BUT I hated the hero, Max. He left the heroine when she was pregnant with his child, got angry with her because she wouldn't have an abortion, angry with her when she wouldn't give her son up for adoption, fell in love with and married another woman, had a child with her and then after his wife died decided maybe the woman he'd dropped might look pretty good after all. He let everyone in their hometown call their son a bastard, never once in 18 years admitting to being his father(although since they both lived in another city he did have a relationship with his son and did pay child support) So, after all that he pretty much expected Kate, the heroine to be grateful that he decided it was \\"the right time\\" for them to be together. Personally, if I was Kate, I'd have jumped on Nicholas(the good looking boss)and told Max to hit the road.	2004-01-07

I tend to be the type of person that reads romance books because I love a happy ending. So, knowing Alexander was going to die I almost didn't buy the book. However, it was a wonderful story!

After Green Calder Grass I was afraid to buy this book so I waited and got it from the library. Smart move! The magic is gone! I have loved the Calder series but the death of Maggie and then the death of Ty really made me not want to read any further. I can't bring myself to care about the characters because I never know who is next on the chopping block. Plus, it's pretty obvious to me where the story is going with Ty and Jessie's daughter and Ty's ex-wife Tara. Tara's going to steal her affection from her mother. Also, I always loved Kat but in this story Janet Dailey all but made her Tara's partner in crime. I almost hated her! The only highlight was Laredo and Jessie's relationship but even that was hard to get into because of Ty and Jessie. Oh well, I gave it one more shot but the magic is most definately gone!	2004-01-06

The hero of this story never believed that his daughter was his and still refused to accept it right up until he was hit in the face with the fact that his wife had not cheated on him. Sure he apologized in the end of the book but by that point who cared? I couldn't believe the heroine took him back. Someone needs to show me the romance in this story because I sure couldn't find it!! I used to love Anne Mather's books but lately they all seem to be like this.

I have to be honest and say that this book was not as good as Marrying McCabe or any of the other SAS books from this series but I still enjoyed it.

Don't get me wrong, it's another great story by Suzanne Brockmann but I felt like Sam should have had to work for Alyssa a bit more after how badly he had hurt her in the previous books.Plus Mary Lou could have stood on her head and sang the Star Spangle Banner and I'd still hate her.

I wait for every book she has coming out and grab them up as soon as they are on the shelf. But Sarah's Child....well, let's just say that I was pulling for Max and Sarah to get together and for Sarah to dump Rome right where she found him! Rome meets Sarah first, looks right over her and marries her best friend and proceeds to have two children with her. Sarah, who was really a very wimpy person but I liked her anyway, has always loved Rome. Now, Rome's wife and children are killed in an accident and he gets involved with Sarah because he's always been attracted to her. They marry, he visits her room for sex and then pratically leaves money on the table before returning to his room to sleep. Sarah accidently gets pregnant and Rome asks her to get an abortion because he doesn't want anymore children to replace his children who have died. I picked this book up in the store because it had Linda Howard's name on it but I hated it. I hated Rome. The story really bothered me that he met Sarah first but went for her best friend. I never got over the feeling that Sarah was second best so starting from the first chapter I was waiting for LH to change my mind but it never came. When I read a romance book I'm looking for a story that leaves me feeling good but this book left me frustrated. I normally keep a copy of each of LH's books that come out but this one is heading right for the yard sale table!!	2003-07-05

This book is the sequel(if you can call it that) to Apache Promise however the heroine of the first book is killed off in a scene which we never read about to make way for the new heroine who was a  10 year old child in the first book. I have liked Ms. Hudson's other books and I grabbed this one in a hurry only to find out in the first two pages that instead of more to the story Angela and Matt it was Matt's love story with another woman. I tried to read it but could never get into the story because I had read the first one. Romance should be about fairy tale endings where everything works out right in the end....[spoiler] When I read a romance I want to finish it with a good feeling not feeling as though I had been robbed!!!!	2003-05-08

Sharon was married to Fergus but she caught him embracing another woman. Fergus was unable to tell Sharon that he didn't have feelings for this woman so Sharon left him and he married \\"the other woman\\" fast forward 5 years. Now Fergus is free again because his wife has died and Sharon is accused of murder. Fergus is determined to save her and to get another chance with her. The hero in his book fell on his face in the beginning and never got back up. He basically chose \\"the other woman\\" over Sharon while he was married to her and somehow I never got over that. It left me with the feeling that Sharon was second choice. The book left me with such a sour taste that I wished I never read it all.	2002-10-30

The whole book left me feeling unsatisfied. Especially when the &quot;hero&quot;, and I use that term loosely, cheats on Peach without an ounce of remorse and Peach sees it as her fault for not understanding his needs.	2002-06-08
US	44731853	RMTJD5G6IC2ZS	1575661225	180376555	AN Uncommon Woman	Books	1	2	2	N	N	Preachy	I picked up this book as I was traveling. I found it less than entertaining. Through out the book the author preaches at you. I was not able to bond with the characters because of this. The author takes various time periods in history and uses them as a reason to preach on the dangers of guns and as the reason for gun control. She also preaches about the Vietnam War and I was very upset that she would make such a blanket statement as the soldiers that died, died for nothing. I agree that it was a war that didn't need to be fought by us I draw the line at any such statement about our service personnel. Although I myself do agree with some of what she says I pick up fiction because I want to *get away* from the realities of life instead the book was like being in a one sided debate.	2002-02-01

I won't go into details of the book since a lot of other people have but I have to say that this is the best book that I have read in awhile! I laughed so hard though the whole thing! I highly recommend this book!	2001-08-17
