US	51956559	RG4RNOHMQ4OHG	0425192644	322157350	Death at Glamis Castle (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 9)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	I enjoyed this entry	more than most of the other reviewers, apparently. Some of the things the other reviewers complain about I actually enjoyed. It is true that the reader knows pretty quickly who committed the murder but the manner in which we get to see Charles & Kate work toward the solution is interesting and full of historical trivia. <br />Lord Charles Sheridan and his wife Kate are called upon by the about-to-be-crowned King Edward (again) to find his missing son, the one that should be the future king but has been exiled to Glamis Castle in Scotland for ten years and reported to be dead. He had been an embarrassment to the royal family for years and they had decided to announce his death rather than allowing him to become king at some point in the future. The German Kaiser has found out that 'Prince Eddy' is still alive and wants to kidnap him and present him to the public in order to embarrass the British royal family (and potentially bring the royal family down). <br />The story is filled with historical trivia and turn-of-the-century small town Scottish life and I found it interesting. I like the main characters as well, probably helping me be interested in the non-mystery aspects & descriptions. <br />I will definitely be reading the next book in the series, \\"Death in Hyde Park.\\"	2004-11-08
US	51956559	R2OVOVW8XR21NS	0061032484	637368678	Children of the Storm	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Favorite Series	There are two other mystery series that I would say compete with the Amelia Peabody series as my favorite, but I have to say that this one has become my very favorite. <br />This, the 15th adventure featuring Amelia & family, is one of the best. There is less action than in other episodes, but the writing of the family's daily life is superb. Ms. Peters has done such a good job of incorporating all the extended members of the family - each one has his/her own personality and each one contributes something to the story that the characters have become almost real to me. <br />In this entry, a series of events take place that are seemingly unrelated, but Amelia realizes that there must be a pattern. As well, she has been warned that the children are in danger and she assumes that the warning applies to the grandchildren - the twins of Ramses & Nefret and the two children of David & Lia. She cannot, however, recognize the pattern of events (a boating accident, a car accident, a runaway horse, the death of a man that has stolen some artifacts from Cyrus, and more) and her inability to see the big picture almost ends in disaster. <br />The interaction between Amelia and Emerson is sharp, as always; that between Ramses and Nefret, not so well written, but still entertaining.  <br />The ending is exciting to read and most everything is explained in a satisfactory manner. And the very last event is hilarious and foretells of more fun in the future with the grandchildren.	2004-10-20

It deals with a more serious subject than previous entries - that of a racism that is, unfortunately, still prevalant in some communities. <br />In this episode, P.I. Sarah Booth Delaney is asked by the widow of a murdered black blues musician to find out who really killed him as she doesn't think the man accused, a white formerly racist bluesman, is guilty. <br />Sarah Booth must deal with, among the normal problems an investigation brings, a town that is divided along racial lines due to the killing, a son of the murdered man who hates all white people, two biker friends of the accused (also racist), and, of course, Jitty, her house ghost. I must admit that I agree with one of the other reviewers that Jitty can be tiresome as she contradicts herself repeatedly and, for some reason, the author insists on describing her various outfits down to the smallest detail. <br />Also in the plot is some romance - Sarah Booth is in love with the married sheriff, she is falling in love with the accused, and she has a few dates with a rich northerner who is in town to buy the club that the murdered man owned. <br />I think that this book is the best of the series thus far - it seems to reach a new level of competence in its style of writing and tackles a very serious subject with sensitivity. For me, it was almost a 5-star book, and would have been even closer to 5 stars if Jitty had been dropped completely or been a smaller part of the book. <br />Will definitely be reading the next in the series, \\"Hallowed Bones.\\"	2004-10-20

In this entry, she receives a photo of a woman wearing the golden jewels that had disappeared during the Nazi reign in Germany known as the Trojan Gold. To make it interesting, however, it is not a photograph of the original finder's wife, Frau Schliemann, as Vicky first supposes, but a modern photograph, meaning the gold has been found. <br /> <br />Vicky figures out who has the gold and races with her boss Schmidt to a small ski resort town, also in Germany, to find the gold. Meeting here there are several other art historians with whom she had attended an art conference the previous year as well as, of course, her sometimes boyfriend, Sir John Smythe. <br /> <br />The action is fast paced enough to keep the book interesting while the romance between Vicki and John reaches new levels. And, making this a perfect mystery read, there is plenty of humor as well. This is an excellently written mystery with suspects to choose from and clues to help along the way. <br /> <br />I have already purchased the fifth and, at least until now, last of the Vicky Bliss series. I certainly wish that Elizabeth Peters would write a new one!	2004-09-28

There are, as usual, plenty of characters to sort out BUT unlike most of her other books, most of them stay in the background or fade quickly into the background. That was a little disappointing to me but I still enjoyed the antics of Doug Perkins (of Perkins & Tate, a PR firm) and his cat Pandora. Pandora is a treat and, in this book, has as much personality as any of the characters. <br />The mystery revolves around the death of a member of an American tour group working its way through Europe and now in London. The tour company is a client of the PR firm and Doug is called upon to sooth the moods of the remaining members of the tour. The mystery is secondary to the descriptions of the dynamics of the tour group but it was fun to figure out who the culprit was and the mystery is wrapped up rather quickly and neatly. <br />If you are a fan of Babson's, add this to your list to read. If not, don't start with this one because it does not do justice to her usual higher standards.	2004-09-16
US	51956559	RLEDZBEQU15H3	0380731169	622571155	Die for Love	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A little disappointing	I enjoy this series quite a bit, although of Ms. Peters' three series, it is my least favorite and I almost rated this entry just three stars. This third entry has our favorite librarian, Jacqueline Kirby, attending a romance author/publisher convention in New York,mostly just to escape her boring home city and to use it as a tax write-off since it is remotely related to her field. <br />Not long after she arrives, there is a murder; a gossip columnist is killed. There is a bevy of suspects for Jacqueline to sort through and therein lies one of the problems of this book - the suspects are a little exaggerated and overblown. Another problem I had with this book was Jacqueline herself. While she was arrogant and stand-offish in the first two books, in this one she is downright mean to some people, particularly to her semi-boyfriend, who has followed her to NYC for the conference. Rather than finding her amusingly sarcastic, this time I found her irritating. The third problem with the book was that this one was a little dated. The first two books of the series, also having been written in the early 1980's, did not come across as being 20 years old but I guess the situation of the romance conference and the descriptions of the dress styles (important to the plot of the book) really showed that this is a re-issue. <br />But, any Elizabeth Peters book is head & shoulders above most other mystery writers today and I would recommend this book to any mystery lover.	2004-09-11

I had watched the show a few times, but not religiously by any means. When I saw this book in the store, I thought it would be along the lines of the \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" books which I enjoy reading, so I picked it up.  <br />Author Lee Goldberg does an excellent job so staying true to the series' characters and does a good job of describing the action that takes place.  <br />There are two mysteries in this book: Someone is committing copycat murders following the m.o. of various serial killers and a man dies on the operating table undergoing a kidney transplant. The latter mystery itself is rather easy to figure out and is strictly a subplot to the serial killer. That mystery is more difficult and has a nice twist ending.  <br />Some of the clues given would never be noted by anyone without a medical background, but that did not bother me too much; there were plenty of other clues to help me figure out whodunnit.  <br />Looking forward to reading the next in the series.	2004-08-11

King has done one of the best, probably the best, jobs of keeping Sherlock Holmes alive and well. The books that revolve around him and his wife Mary Russell are well-written, well-plotted, and well-characterized. <br />In this entry, Mary & Sherlock are summoned to an old English estate to help out two friends. One of them is the newly appointed Duke but does not want to be there, preferring to return to the Middle East where he had lived for twenty years doing undercover work for Sherlock's brother, Mycroft. <br />Someone is out to murder him, however, with their own eyes on the dukedom. There are suspects aplenty and lots of clues thrown in to entice the reader to guessing whodunnit. <br />Part of the story revolves around the past - another member of the family was put to death in front of the firing squad for treason during WWI and Mary & Sherlock work to solve that mystery as well. Some of that story is told through the warfield diary of that soldier and some of the passages are truly heartbreaking to read. <br />An excellent book, both as a mystery and as a novel.	2004-08-05

I must say that the main reason this entry did not appeal to me is the device George uses of one of the &quot;guest character's&quot; (Gideon) diary. I found it, well, boring, to read his diary. Maybe I just did not like his persona or maybe I found it confusing that the diary & the regular chapters were not written simultaneously - I was confused sometimes because he would be writing about things that had not happened yet or had happened earlier in the book. <br /> I was also disappointed in the fact that some loose ends from earlier books were not mentioned in this one - particularly Haver's potential boyfriend neighbor or her mother. <br /> There was a new character introduced that I hope to see in future books - a potential love interest for Nkata. <br /> Will still pick up the next book to read but won't have as much enthusiasm as I usually do.	2004-08-05

Well, that almost happens in this book, but a friendship develops instead. The problem is that the character that would normally tempt her was not fleshed out enough; in fact, that is the problem with most of the characters in this book - most are stereotypical.  <br />I also had two problems with this entry: one, Lori suspects someone of doing the mischieviousness that is impossible. Any regular reader of this series knows the person she suspects would never do anything like the crimes in the book. And two, the manner in which the culprit manages to get away with his/her 'crimes' for so long is slightly ridiculous.  <br />Not for sure if I will be picking up the next book in the series or not.	2004-08-01

This entry is far from my favorite of the series but is still enjoyable.  <br />China is attending, along with her best friend Ruby, an arts & crafts fair in a neighboring Texas town. That weekend the villian of town is murdered, apparently the victim of one of his own booby traps. Of course, China thinks differently and sets out to find the murderer. There are the usual cast of suspects, all residents of the small town and all with his/her own reason for wanting the man dead.  <br />I am not for sure why I did not like this book as much as I usually like the entries in this series; maybe I felt it was a little too cookie-cutter than most of her previous books. But, it is still a cut above most of the books out today and I am still looking forward to reading the next book, A Dilly of a Death.	2004-08-01

A friend of mine kept recommending Patricia Cornwell to me and I finally bought this book to start and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />This is more of a police/medical procedural than a classic mystery. Dr. Kay Scarpetta is the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, VA and is working with the police to find a serial rapist/murderer. Along the way, her office is implicated in some leaks to the press and she must deal with her boss about that in addition to the stress of the case itself.<br /><br />The action is plotted at a nice pace, some of the details are graphic (as in Kathy Reichs' series), and the ending is exciting to follow. There are not many writers today that can truly make the reader nervous and Ms. Cornwell did that for me.<br /><br />Looking forward to buying and reading the next in the series soon.	2004-08-01

I had read some decent-to-great reviews of it, saw it in the bookstore, and bought it. I was not disappointed BUT thought the ending was quite rushed and left some things hanging while other things were solved with too much contrivance.<br />Prosper and Bo are two brothers, aged 12 and 5 respectively, who have run away from an aunt & uncle to Venice. Their late mother had told them stories all their lives about how wonderful the city was and, being miserable with the aunt, they go there to live. They meet a small group of other 'strays' and begin to live with them, surviving through pickpocketing and theivery, most of which is done by their leader, The Thief Lord.<br />The book is well written (and well translated) but there was something unsatisfying about the last 1/4 of the book. It was still enjoyable but when I finished the last page, I was left with a somewhat bad taste in my mouth. I don't know if she plans on writing a sequel in the future (although her next book, already out, is not a sequel to this one) and therefore wanted to leave some cliffhangers. If that is the case, the cliffhangers are a weird form of such that I have never read before. <br />Anyway, a nice enjoyable book with some morals to be had (\\"be careful what you wish for as it might come true\\" is the main one that I saw), not much violence, and some very enjoyable characters.	2004-07-11
US	51956559	RXFHJSZPFY1YY	0671028383	662513874	Grave Secrets	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Another Winner	Kathy Reichs' Dr. Temperance Brennan (Tempe) is one of the more complicated main mystery characters being written today. She is a combination of strength (in this book she must spend a day digging around in a septic tank) and emotional caring that makes for an interesting person that is not cookie-cutter like so many of today's 'sleuths.'<br />The mystery begins with Tempe working in a remote Guatemalan village uncovering long buried victims of a junta's attack. She is then dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into investigating the disappearance of four young women in Guatemala City, leading to complications in which the government is involved. The action moves from Guatemala to Canada and back again. There is romance involved, as well, as she begins to be attracted to the Guatemalan detective with whom she is working (he is also an old friend of Tempe's sometime boyfriend Andrew Ryan which provides further drama).<br />I enjoyed this book as I have all of Reichs mysteries. One thing did stick out in my mind though as I was reading: several times Tempe is complaining (which she has toned down since her first book appearance) about being constantly surronded by death. I could not help but think, &quot;Well, that is your chosen profession. Sure it must be disheartening at times but if it is creating that much travail, change jobs.&quot; I guess my feeling was a throwback to that first book in which Tempe came across as somewhat whiny.<br />That aside, I will definitely be reading the next books in the series.	2004-07-11

There are a few suspects from which to choose, making it fun to guess which is the guilty party.<BR>More interesting, Elizabeth and Earl come closer to admitting their feelings for one another.

Some people find the references to other mysteries and mystery writers annoying but I find it fun as I can many times relate to the reference, adding an extra little bit of pleasure to the mystery.<br />I particularly enjoyed this book because it features a lot of interplay between husband and wife Max &amp; Annie Darling without focusing solely on their relationship. A wealthy &quot;older&quot; woman is about to announce her engagement to a much younger man when a murder occurs preventing that event from happening. A good friend of Annie's is the prime suspect for the murder and Annie &amp; Max must, of course, step in to find the real killer. Max, in fact, is deputized to help the sheriff, a fact that irritates Annie to no end.<BR>There are a few side issues thrown in for fun and they make for some nice diversions from the main mystery. I must say that one reason I especially enjoyed this book is that Max's mother does not play a big role - I do find her a little irritating as I find her somewhat of a stereotype airhead.<BR>Really looking forward to the next entry in the series: &quot;Murder Walks the Plank&quot; and hope to see a new Henri O. mystery soon!	2004-07-11

There is a tenth, and last, book available.<BR>In the book, Fielding and his apprentice Jeremy Proctor are investigating the theft of some letters from the residence of a high-ranking official in London, an official that is dealing with the American colonies. The time period being pre-Revolutionary War means that the letters are related to the Americans creating problems. Benjamin Franklin appears and plays quite a major role in the book and I like the way the author fleshed out his character, showing both his genius and his faults (mainly his womanizing). <BR>While there is not a lot of action in this book, the period descriptions make up for that. As well, the furthering of Jeremy's personal relationships makes this one of the better and more interesting books in the series and that is saying a lot considering most of the series has been excellent.	2004-06-27

This is the second appearance of Madame Karitska, her first being in &quot;The Clairvoyant Countess.&quot; <BR>It is more of a series of very short stories with psychic Karitska being the tie that binds them together. Most of the stories are told without a lot of characterization, but that did not distract me too much. For some reason, maybe having read every fiction book that Ms. Gilman has written helped, I was able to color the characters myself and they did not seem so one-dimensional. <BR>I would recommend this book to those fans of Gilman's, especially if they enjoyed the first book from years ago that featured Karitska.	2004-05-30

This book, however, is so full of holes that I was amazed that I was reading something by the same author that wrote a 'masterpieces' such as \\"The Firm.\\" <BR>Clay Carter is an overworked public defender, having worked five years in the Washington, D.C. public defender's office. He is suddenly offered the chance to earn a quick $10million by persuading victims' families to accept a no-questions-asked $5million rather than suing a pharmaceutical company. He is then offered a second, larger case through which he earns $100million. Then things fall apart with the third case.<BR>I did not care for the main character at all and while that happens sometimes in books, usually it is a device to prove a moral. In this case, I didn't like him because he did things that no lawyer with any intelligence (and supposedly this Carter is intelligent) would do. For example, he performs some insider trading without blinking an eye. The whole set-up for this to happen was ridiculous.<BR>Secondly, I guess I was supposed to feel something for him and his girlfriend. They break up, she gets married, and I guess I was supposed to wish for them to get back together and/or to feel sorry for Carter. I didn't do either mainly because there was absolutely nothing written to show that they even cared about each other, with the exception of some stereotypical sexual encounters - she in particular came off as nothing more than a spoiled rich girl.<BR>All in all, this is the absolute worse book by Grisham I have read and I have to say that I would not recommend this one to anyone unless they are truly diehard Grisham fans.	2004-05-24

Jake Tiptree is still adjusting to life in Eastport, Maine, having moved there from New York. Her house is in desparate need of renovating and she would rather spend her time doing that but gets involved in the death of a young man from the town after she and her best friend, Ellie, find him washed ashore. Then two other people are killed and there is a wave of vandalism and muggings in the previously peaceful small town. <BR>There are plenty of characters to enliven the tale and provide suspects but it is still pretty simple to figure out who did the murders. The strength of this book is in its descriptions of small town life - the citizens, the buildings, the stores, etc. The weaknesses fall in the too pat coincidences (a man that Jake had helped put in jail in NYC has bought a house in the same small town in which she lives after he is paroled, for example).<BR>All in all, a pleasant read for those who do not require their mysteries to have too much depth and don't require too much thinking.	2004-05-07

Although I am sure most people, including Mr. Woods himself, are tired of this comparison, this book is very Clancy-ish in its Russia vs. U.S. one-upmanship and its submarine and weaponry technological detail work.<br />The story is told from two alternating viewpoints: the first from CIA department head Katherine Rule who thinks she has discovered a plot in which Russia will be invading Sweden. Not one of her superiors believes her and she must go behind their backs to continue investigating this dire possibility. The other viewpoint is that of a Russian submarine commander, moved from his normal naval command to an elite Russian fighting force, the one being trained for the invasion itself.<br />The storytelling is competent and not as technologically detailed as a Tom Clancy, making the story, in my opinion, flow more smoothly than Clancy's. I had figured out who the mole in the CIA book was long before the end of the book but it held my interest enough to want to find out how &amp; when Katherine would discover it. <br />All in all, a nice earlier book by Woods and a step above most of his somewhat cookie-cutter mystery thrillers.	2004-05-03

The concept begins simply enough - two men meet on a trans-Atlantic plane flight, both of them are in unhappy marriages, and they end up making a deal to kill each other's wives. The protagonist of this book, Sandy Kinsolving, decides to back out of the deal, but the other man has something else in mind and goes ahead with his part of the bargain and kills Sandy's wife. The story spirals from that moment on and is, for the most part, quite interesting.<BR>There were two editorial errors though. One: Sandy's wife is killed while he is waiting in a limo for her. While waiting, he takes a mobile phone call from his brother-in-law, but is OFF the phone at the time of the actual killing. However, he and his bro-i-l both tell the police that they were talking at the time (\\"I was still talking to him [his bro-i-l] when...the doorman came to get me\\") and that was simply not the case. I thought at first he was trying to cover himself but that was also not the case.<BR>Second error: Sandy states later in the book that his wife had told him that she had pictures of him [commiting adultery]. Well, that never happened, at least in the conversation written in the book regarding why she wants a divorce and I would think that that would certainly be mentioned.<BR>The book is typical Stuart Woods material, meaning certainly enjoyable but nothing worthy of any awards or high praise. I read this one in about 3 hours on a rainy Sunday. So if you enjoy Grisham-ish books and have a few hours to kill, this is certainly for you.	2004-04-12

It took me a while to figure out what was bothering me and I finally realized that Agatha, in this book, had resorted to namecalling in her insults and some of those names are quite vicious. She has in all the books been quite tart with others but in this one, she is downright vicious. <BR>The leader of a rambling group (a group of people who get together to walk &amp; enjoy the country) from a nearby village is murdered. A friend's niece is one of the suspects and she asks Agatha to investigate. Agatha, naturally, agrees to do so and she &amp; James go undercover as a married couple in the nearby village.<BR>The suspects are plenty and none of them are likeable. Not even any of the secondary characters are that nice.<BR>I would hesitate to pick up the next book in the series if it were not for the cliffhanger ending of this one.	2004-04-09
US	51956559	R1NHUIZGN3RD2K	0425189775	249229548	Q is for Quarry	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Excellent	I had been saving this book for a few months, knowing that once I started it, I would not put it down until I finished and that is exactly what happened. One of the blurbs on my copy of this 17th entry into the fantastic Kinsey Millhone series says that after you finish the book, you have trouble realizing that Kinsey is not a real person and, for one of the rare times, that blurb is correct. <BR>This book is more of a police procedural than previous Grafton books. The case revolves around an unsolved murder from 18 years previously. Two cops, one retired &amp; one on medical leave, want to revisit the case to see if they can identify the teenage victim that was brutally stabbed and tossed into a quarry and to see if they can solve the crime.<BR>There is not a lot of personal advancement in either Kinsey's involvement with her family nor in Henry's life, but there are a few parts devoted to those issues and they whet your appetite enough to want more.<BR>A great read, nice ending, and nice teasing on the personal side to want the next book to come out soon.	2004-03-30

It is quite different in many aspects to the Peabody series but still features a strong central female character, some romance thrown into the mystery, and many red herrings and rather arcane information.<br />In this third entry of the series, Vicky Bliss receives an anonymous plane ticket and hotel reservation to Stockholm. She knows that the invite is from Sir John Smythe, introduced in the last book and her somewhat love interest. She goes to Stockholm, discovers what the mystery involves, is led to an island in the north of Sweden to follow up on some leads and most of the action takes place there. The mystery is interesting, the clues are available to the reader, there are plenty of red herrings to make it fun, and the ending is very satisfactory. <br />I guess there are only a couple of more in this series. I wonder if Ms. Peters will ever write any more or will stick with just the Peabody books?	2004-03-22

While the mysteries themselves are interesting (although the culprit in this particular book was easier to figure out than usual), the relationships between the recurring characters is what makes me look forward to reading each book. The main characters, midwife Sarah Brandt and policeman Frank Malloy, are both likeable and the banter between them is fun without being obnoxious and adds some romance and lightness to the darker side of the books. <br />And there is indeed a dark side to this book. In addition to the murder of a young lady, there are vivid descriptions of what it was like to live in turn-of-the-century New York, particularly if you were an immigrant and/or poor. The lives of the immigrants was not a pleasant one and I have to wonder if the life in New York was better than what they had escaped. <br />There is also a big clue to the unsolved murder of Sarah Brandt's husband from three years previous and that clue is not going to lead to much happiness for anyone if it plays out the way it looks to be headed. Really looking forward to the next book, Murder on Marble Row.	2004-03-14

But that is still a step above 99% of the mystery writers writing today. I don't know why I was a little disappointed in this entry in the long-running series.<br />One thing that bothered me was the fact that, while Inspector Lynley has always be insufferable with his thinking that he is always right, that attribute is kicked up a notch in the current circumstances. He finds Havers' actions at the end of the last book to be unexcusable and refuses to see her side of the story. While I can see him reacting in that way, it is exaggerated a bit much for my liking; he is an intelligent man, after all, and his actions are those of one with lesser intelligence.<br />Anyway, the writing is fine as always. I particularly like the parts dealing with Havers - she and Lynley are working on the same case in different parts of England so most of the book goes back &amp; forth between London and the scene of the crime in the Peak District. I am particularly interested in seeing where the relationship between Havers and her neighbor, Azhar, is heading.<br />I already have the next in the series, A Traitor to Memory, and will be reading it soon.	2004-03-13

This one plays more like a John Grisham than some of his other efforts.<br />Jesse Warden, a former DEA agent, has been sentenced to prison after being wrongly convicted for the murder of his DEA partner. His ex-boss removes him from prison to go undercover in a very small town in the northwest where a man has turned the town into a cult. The DEA is not for sure what the leader's plans are and they want to find out before he can act. Jesse is a likeable but tough character; Woods does a pretty good job of blending his two personalities together. The action is tense and makes you want to continue reading to see what develops. <br />I am a fan of Stuart Woods and am glad I picked up this older book to read. Looking forward to more from him.	2004-03-10

It is a typical English police procedural with the added bonus of having some personal glimpses of the inspector and his family thown in. Some books tend to be too cut &amp; dry with its police work but this one really has a nice balance between the professional and personal sides of the main character. The mystery is rather easy to figure out as there is one really big clue thrown in towards the beginning but that did not detract from my enjoyment. Looking forward to reading the second &amp; third books.	2004-03-10

Of course, there is a murder (the producer of the film) or was it murder? There is a chance that it is the result of negligence on the part of the B&amp;B. Of course, it is obvious that it is a murder and, for me, it was obvious from almost the beginning who had done the deed. For that reason I almost rated it 3 instead of 4 stars. But, the interaction between the cousins and their families is fun to read (although Bill, Renie's husband, was silly in his duck outfit for Halloween). <br />All in all, a pleasant read and I will continue reading the series if she keeps the quality at this level or higher.	2004-03-02

There were some interesting subplots: Meg, the chef sister, sometimes comes off as a caricature but not in this book; Miles may be disappearing for about a year on a secret mission...<BR>I was also surprised to see some quite current relevant mentions in this book; e.g., Enron, Iraq.<BR>A group of Civil War reenactors swarm into the inn at Hemlock Falls ready to reenact the 133rd anniversary of the Battle of Hemlock. Meanwhile, three of Meg's boyfriend's (Andy, a doctor) patients have died mysteriously and he asks Quill to help find out what happened. The two plots are interwoven quite nicely and also wrapped up quite satisfactorily. <BR>I hope to see more of this series as I find it one of the more enjoyable ones out there (with the exception of just one or two earlier episodes).	2004-02-26

I find Dorothy Martin interesting - mature, yet sometimes silly enough to make her not stuffy. This is the eighth in the series and one of the better ones. A schoolteacher's husband is killed and she, along with her young daughter, are having trouble coping with all the pressures that would go along with that. In steps Dorothy to help her both with the coping and with the solving of the mystery. Her investigation takes her a few times to London, which provides a break from the smalltown descriptions that normally accompany a book in this series. There were two reasons I did not give this book 4 stars: I was able to figure out the culprit long before the end of the book and I find the character of Dorothy's husband, Alan, a 2-dimensional character and wish he would be fleshed out a bit. But, this is a quite enjoyable read and I would recommend it, particularly to those that have read the earlier books in the series.	2004-02-05

In this entry, Precious Ramotswe has some difficulties to deal with, both professional and personal. The agency is not making any money; there is an &quot;important Government man&quot; that wants her to investigate his brother's poisoning; her fianc, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is harboring secrets. Meanwhile, her assistant, Mma Makutsi, must help a beauty pageant organizer determine if any of the four finalists are worthy of the title, hence the title, &quot;Morality for Beautiful Girls.&quot; <BR>There is one small detail that I find a little irritating - the author refers to Mma Ramotswe's auto as the &quot;tiny white van&quot;...never &quot;the van&quot; or &quot;her van&quot; but always the &quot;tiny white van&quot;...for some reason, after about 40 times, that was starting to rankle me.<BR>All in all, another great enjoyable read and I am really looking forward to the next book.	2004-01-31

The Jacqueline Kirby series was one of two that she was writing almost concurrently (the other being the Vicky Bliss series) and dates before the Amelia Peabody books. The writing is not as smooth as the Peabody ones but is still enjoyable. <br />In this entry, Kirby is invited to a weekend in an English manor house to look at a letter that is supposed to be sufficient evidence to prove King Richard III of being innocent of killing his two nephews. The members of a Ricardian society are meeting and are playing the roles of someone that played a part in that history. Once there, several members of the party are treated to practical jokes. It was, for me, not too confusing to keep the characters straight; I basically just remembered the characters' real names as opposed to their role-playing character. <br />Jacqueline is able to figure out the culprit behind the practical jokes before it goes too far but, of course, not before the reader is led to believe that something serious has happened. <br />While this series does not live up to the Peabody books, and this book is nowhere in the league of &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; by Josephine Tey, it is quite an enjoyable read and I do really like the main character.	2004-01-25

There has been only one book (Killer Market) in this series that I found to be even a bit lacking and that is quite unusual in a series that has gone on this long. In this episode, Judge Deborah Knott goes to the local carnival with her friends and discovers a dead body. As she works to solve the murder with her friend Dwight, we are exposed to more of her large family, but it really never gets confusing. Maron manages to make it clear who belongs to whom, even with the added relatives that this tale brings into the picture. The mystery is interesting and hard to solve and, just as importantly, there is progress in Deborah's personal life that is very satisfying to read. I know that Maron's next book is a stand-alone (neither a Knott nor a Harald book...will she ever write more Sigrid Harald books?) but I will definitely buy it. I just hope she returns to North Carolina soon.	2004-01-20

In this entry, the murder of one of Elizabeth's tenants is not the main focus. More time is spent on the dramas going on in her life as well as the lives of the other inhabitants of fictional Sitting Marsh. I enjoyed this book for that very reason - Kate Kingsbury tends to write better serial fiction than actual mysteries. Usually the mystery parts of her books are quite easy to figure out and I prefer reading about the progress in the various relationships. All in all, this is a quick and light read that makes for a pleasant Sunday afternoon.	2004-01-18

I really enjoyed the first in the series, The Thief-Taker and was looking forward to this second book. And I was not disappointed (much). Henry Morton, the likeable Bow Street Runner, is back and is this time attempting to solve the murder of a French count's mistress. There are many interesting characters to keep the novel moving along but there were also some confusing chapters - it was sometimes difficult to keep track of who was a royalist (interested in returning the French king to the throne) and who was a Bonapartist. That aside, it is an interesting book, with great attention to period detail and the main character is possibly more interesting and likeable in this entry than the first time around. Will be on the look out for the third in the series.	2003-12-16

This one is also enjoyable but very light and a very quick read; I finished it off on a Sunday evening in about 3 hours. I am not for sure why Oprah had chosen this book as one of her club selections as opposed to perhaps \\"Open Range\\" a much more complex but just as enjoyable read.<br />The subject of this book is divorce and its affects on the woman left behind and her son. The main character, Samantha, is well written and generates your sympathy. Her son is also well written having the proper amount of angst exhibited for an 11-year-old without being a caricature. However, there are secondary characters that are not quite as fleshed out as they should be; for example, I could never get a real grasp on either Samantha's mother nor her best friend.<br />I would recommend this book as pleasant rainy day reading but not for any in-depth study.	2003-12-16

They are rather inconsistent and this one falls somewhere in the middle of the rest. In this episode, Carolyn Blue and her husband are in San Francisco. Upon arriving, Carolyn dutifully calls her mother-in-law, who lives there, only to discover that she has been jailed on a murder charge.<br />As with her other books, Ms. Fairbanks, has written each chapter from the perspective of either Carolyn, her husband, or, in this case, the private detective hired to help find the real murderer. The chapter is then written in first person from that character's viewpoint.<br />There were several errors in this book. Twice was Carolyn to be written in the first person, but she was referred to in the third. Another error - the male private detective tells Carolyn that he has a relationship with a man, she comments on it, and then about 10 pages later, he tells her again and she is shocked. And, Carolyn and the detective go to a bar and order a Corona beer which is served to them on tap. Unless something has changed in the last year or so, Corona is only served in bottles. <br />And while this is not an error, I found it incredibly strange that Jason Blue, son of the accused murdered does absolutely nothing other than have his father hire the detective, to free his mother. If my mother were in jail, I would be doing whatever it took to get her out.<br />Not for sure if I will be buying the next in this series or not.	2003-12-11

I have to say that while this book is better than most mysteries being sold today, it is not great in comparison with her earlier efforts.<BR>In this entry, Homer &amp; Mary Kelly set out to help a man, Leonard Sheldrake, find a woman with whom he has fallen in love (at first sight while at an Escher exhibition in a museum). The woman is not easy to find as she is attempting to avoid one of her relatives, a woman set on vengeance for the death of her baby.<BR>The plot of this book is not as complicated as others by Ms. Langton but still was sometimes a bit confusing for me, particularly with regards to some torn up photographs found by Leonard. I had to read the paragraphs describing the pictures a couple of times to get the images straight in my mind and even then I am not for sure that I had it all correct.<BR>But, when all is said and done, this is a good book and I would recommend it to anyone, particularly if they are already familiar with the series.	2003-12-03

There are the usual elements of an Amelia Peabody mystery: a couple of dead bodies, some threats made against the family, Emerson screaming, Peabody knowing all, Ramses being enigmatic and so forth.<BR>In this episode, Amelia and family are being led to believe that someone has found a previously undiscovered royal tomb. They waver back &amp; forth as to whether this is possible or not but continue to think about the clues pointing in that direction. <BR>Meanwhile, Ramses is convinced by the army to sneak himself into the enemy-controlled Gaza to discover if their old nemesis, Sethos, has indeed gone over to the enemy. Amelia, Emerson, and Nefret cannot allow him to do this without their help, of course, and mayhem ensues.<BR>All in all an enjoyable read and a nice cliffhanger at the end to build interest in the next book.	2003-12-01

I find the characters to be intelligent but fun at the same time. I also like the way that Bill &amp; Susan Albert (Robin Paige) weave real-life people into the plots. I realize that the people may not have acted the way that they are written, but it is fun to imagine that they would.<BR>I did find this mystery a little too easy to solve and that usually makes me rate a book only 3 stars rather than 4, but I found the locale descriptions and the mystery itself to be well-written enough to deserve the 4th star.<BR>In this episode, Charles &amp; Kate are in Dartmoor - Charles to begin the process of fingerprinting prisoners at the local prison, Kate to get background information for a new book. While there, the local lord is killed and an escaped prisoner is initially blamed. Charles &amp; Kate think that that is not the case and set out to find the real murderer(s).

He has the help of sexy (of course) but married Anabella Graham, the crossword maven for the rival newspaper. <BR>The writing was lively in some spots, but amateurish in others, particularly in its characterizations of the secondary characters, who mostly came across as stereotypes - ugly secretary in love with handsome boss, prissy society column writer, cheating aging sex goddess married to older man, etc.<BR>Not for sure if I will pick up the second in the series or not.	2003-11-09

This is a departure for the series as China Bayles leaves Pecan Springs to go to her ancestral home, Jordan's Crossing in Mississippi, to help her mother with a problematic great-aunt. Most episodes have occurred in &amp; around Pecan Springs. Great Aunt Tullie, about 85 years old, has Huntington's disease, a degenerative &amp; inherited disease, that causes loss of control of muscles, speech, and emotions. There are other problems that have arisen in the years that China has been away - including a claim against the land, a man disappearing, and a mysterious old woman who seems to know more than anyone else about the family's history. I really enjoyed this entry into the series. It showed more depth into the development of characters and it was interesting to see the interaction between China and her semi-estranged mother, Leatha. Definitely worth reading and definitely worth looking forward to the next book.	2003-11-06

It is not a bad book, but certainly not worthy of 5 stars. I may have even considered 4 stars, but the ending was implausible and rushed.<BR>Nora Blackbird is a 31-year-old widow who has two wacky sisters. Her parents have taken off to a tax haven in the Carribean somewhere, apparently just escaping punishment for tax evasion from the government, leaving Nora with a $2million tax payment. I don't really understand why only she, and not all three sisters, is liable for the payment, but okay. An old friend of the family is killed while hosting a luxurious party and Nora decides to figure out who did it. Along the way she meets a couple of attractive men, one on each side of the law. <BR>The book has some funny lines in it. The sisters, at least to me, are not wacky in a funny way, but rather in an annoying way. I wanted to scream at them to grow up. Both of them disappear, creating more problems, and the manner in which they are held captive is slightly ridiculous. <BR>Not for sure if I will buy the second in the series or not...	2003-11-01

I was happy to see that Jitty played a smaller role in this episode as I find the main character, Sarah Booth Delaney, and her cohorts interesting enough without the added benefit of the ghost (that trick also works better, I think, in the Nancy Atherton series, Aunt Dimity, and in the Mignon F. Ballard series with angel Augusta Goodnight). And in this book, I found Jitty especially irritating as she was basically a one-note song, continually harping on her desire for Sarah Booth to get married and have children.<BR>In this book, a friend of Sarah Booth's, Lee, confesses to the murder of her husband, a particularly loathsome man with quite a few enemies. She asks Sarah to dig up evidence that the man deserved to die, intending to play on the jury's sympathy in order to escape punishment. Sarah Booth quickly realizes that Lee is lying and she sets out to solve the crime.<BR>There are plenty of laughs and some excitement along the way to make the book enjoyable. The one complaint I do have is that she sort of stumbled onto solving the mystery and I usually find that somewhat disappointing.<BR>Will definitely pick up the next book in the series, Crossed Bones.	2003-10-25

It is not so intense as the first one as it does not have so many arcane references in it. I started this series after having completed all the Amelia Peabody books written (thus far) and I am not at all disappointed in it even when comparing it to that wonderful series.<BR>In this episode, Vicky goes to Rome to track down the maker of fraudulant antique jewelry. She thinks that the fake jewelry is being made to replace pieces in various museums so the museums will not notice that the real pieces have been stolen, but quickly determines that there is more to the story than that. She meets a smooth con artist, Sir John Smythe, along the way and they become something of an item, although both fight the temptation to act upon their attraction. Peters does a good job of keeping the romance light and it is secondary to the main mystery.<BR>Looking forward to the third entry in the series.	2003-10-20

I enjoy many of the more popular mystery series going today, but find it sometimes hard to believe as the series gets older that the main character in the books would run across so many murders unless s/he is an actual detective or policeman. <BR>In this entry, Augusta is helping a young widow recover from the loss of her husband. The widow, Minda, has returned to her small hometown, hoping that the familiarity of it will help ease her pain. Unfortunately, not too long after she arrives, she finds her cousin, Otto, dead in the women's restroom of the local museum. <BR>The mystery involves events from nearly a century before, giving some added period pieces to the mystery. There are many many characters in the book, making it sometimes confusing. I had to refer to the list of characters in the front of the book a few times until I had all the names straight. That aside, it was a quick read and very enjoyable. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.	2003-10-19

In this episode, Juliet Applebaum's trainer commits suicide...or is it suicide? Juliet feels something amiss and begins delving into his background, including his adopted family, his birth mother, his drug-addicted fiancee. <BR>I enjoy these books because the author does a great job of mixing mystery with day-to-day life without compromising the realism of either. I am glad that she is involving Juliet in the private detective business of her friend Al, because in many series there occurs a disbelief when a &quot;normal&quot; person (one outside the private detective or police world, for example) runs across too many murders.<BR>Looking forward to the next entry.	2003-10-16

This one takes place in the late spring of 1862 and there are outbreaks of smallpox occurring requiring some patients to be quarantined. When one of those patients dies with Narcissa at his side, he whispers something to indicate that there might be some money circulating with the smallpox virus contaminiating it. Narcissa is put in charge of containing that outbreak and, along with Judah Daniel, works to do that while also solving the mystery of how that money came into circulation. This book is a fascinating portrait of Civil War America and the mystery is intriguing as well. Highly recommended.	2003-10-12

He has done that with ease, I think. This book is more of a mystery book than the first one, although still far from the classic mystery genre. It contains so much more than just crime solving. Precious Ramotswe's fiancee, J.L.B. Matekoni plays a much bigger role in this book, as does her secretary, and now-assistent detective, Mma Makutsi.<BR>The main mystery in this entry is the disappearance 10 years earlier of an American woman's son. There are a couple of secondary mysteries, but the main focus of the book is on the engagement of Precious and Mr. Matekoni, as well as two orphan children. <BR>I can't wait to read the third in the series.	2003-09-24

I noticed that, similar to the earlier books, there were some phrases repeated a few times that makes it a little repetitive. However, the mystery itself is interesting and, having lived in Indiana for a few years, I found it nice to recognize some placenames, etc.<BR>In this entry, Jessica is a visiting professor at a small private university in Indiana. While there, a tornado strikes and leaves a professor dead; but was he truly killed by the tornado, or, as Jessica suspects, was there foul play involved? The mystery is wrapped up nicely and I found myself staying up late one evening to finish it. Looking forward to the next entry.	2003-09-15

Aunt Dimity, the &quot;ghost&quot; in the series, does not play a large part in the solving of the mysteries but is very much a side character.<br />In this entry, Lori is trying to discover the person responsible for the murder of a not-so-nice newcomer to Finch. The principal suspect is her friend Kit, who first appeared in an earlier episode of the series and she knows that he is innocent. Along the way to solving the crime (which Lori does not really solve), she and the vicar's nephew, Nicholas, discover some pretty dark secrets about several villagers.<br />I almost rated this 3 stars as I figured out how the victim was killed and, more disappointing, I am getting tired of Lori always meeting and halfway falling in love with a handsome stranger. It seems like in every single story, she is having to stave off emotional and physical attraction to some man. While I am sure that happens in many marriages once, it is getting a little tiresome when you realize that she has done this a few times.	2003-09-13

As stated in other reviews, this is not really so much a mystery as a psychological study of a family under stress. Margot returns to her family home in England after having lived in New York the past eighteen months. She returns home as one of her cousins is on trial for the murder of another cousin, actually the twin of the accused.<BR>Why is this not the best? Well, there are a LOT of characters introduced very quickly into the story and it is, at first, rather confusing keeping up with who is the cousin/aunt/uncle/father/daughter of whom. Secondly, there are few clues as to whom the real murderer is. And last, the final solution is a little out there. The murderer confesses without there being any real pressure on him/her to do so...s/he just states it as a fact and goes on with the story of what really happened.<BR>But, leaving those complaints aside, this book is enjoyable &amp; quick to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a cat mystery and/or is a fan of other Marian Babson books.	2003-08-27

Hart is one of the few authors writing two series, almost concurrently, about which I would be hard pressed to say which I enjoy more. Usually, I have a clear preference. Her other series, the Henry O. books, has a main character that is tougher than either of the stars of these, the Death On Demand mysteries - Annie & Max Darling, but these books tend to have more humor and light heartedness that I find enjoyable.<BR>In this entry, Annie is preparing her store for a signing party for the new book by local author, Emma Clyde. Someone uses her technique of advertising the signing, however, to drudge up some old mysteries on the island and creates some hard feelings in the villagers. When a teacher is killed and is implicated as the person behind the fake flyers, Annie and Max attempt to straighten the situation out. <BR>All in all, a great book, just what you expect from Ms. Hart.	2003-08-17

Her neighbor, Azhar, and his daughter go to a seaside town in Essex to help out some family members. Barbara, being on medical vacation from the beating she received at the end of the last book, goes there to help out, thinking that Azhar will be out of his depth dealing with a criminal investigation.<br />I was surprised at some of the things that she missed during her investigation particularly something with regards to her acting superior officer. The best part of the book for me was the personal interaction betwen Havers and Azhar. I am glad to see her get a personal life other than dealing with her parents' problems. <br />The ending has a major twist and, having already bought the next book in the series, I did something I have never done before and peeked at the beginning to see what the ramifications of that twist would be....so, I guess I will be &quot;forced&quot; to read on...	2003-07-31

I have come to enjoy reading this series more for the events in the lives of Meg &amp; Quill et al than for the mystery itself. <br />In this story a master chef, hired to judge a fried food contest in Hemlock Falls, is found dead, and, as usual, there are suspects galore to sort through. And, as usual, at least one of the sisters' acquaintances is a possible suspect meaning that they must involve themselves in the mystery to save them. <br />I rated this one 3 stars as opposed to 4 as I figured the mystery out midway through the book; otherwise, it would have been 4 stars as it was enjoyable as most of the books in this series have been for me.	2003-07-29

I have stated in my reviews of some of Diane Mott Davidson's other books in this series that I have come to regard Goldy and her family, along with Marla &amp; Julian, almost as real people as she has done such a good job of describing them and making their lives so realistic. <br />I don't know what in the world has happened during the writing of this book. As I was reading this book on vacation with family, I told them a few times that if it were not for the dedication in the front of the book, I would almost believe someone else had written it. In this book, Goldy is completely irresponsible as a parent, Arch is a caricature of an angst-ridden teenager, Marla is in a few scenes and behaves like a rich snob towards everyone, including her supposedly best friend Goldy, Tom was nearly non-existenet except to make an occasional meal and pamper to Goldy's whining....and the list goes on.<br />All of these anomalies were so distracting to me, that I really didn't care much who did what to whom with regards to the murder and other crimes. I hope the next in the series will be back to Ms. Davidson's writing standards.	2003-07-29

This is an incredible mystery written by someone who is becoming one of my favorite authors very quickly. Each book in this series has been better than the last.<br />In this story, Kathy &amp; Brock are helping an old acquaintance (actually, an old nemesis of Brock's) with the kidnapping of his much younger wife. The twist is that the ransom is a rare stamp, a Chalon Head (hence the name). There are so many twists and turns in this book that it would be impossible for me to list them all but rest assured, it is not confusing at all, merely enjoyable to the last page.<br />Congratulations to Mr. Maitland for another creative and well-written book.	2003-07-29

After reading the first in the series, \\"AR and the Quiche of Death,\\" I thought I had found a new series to replace the series that I could no longer find (author passed away or quit writing). <br />There are at least two major plot points in this book that are retreads of the first one: the murder victim is a womanizer (exactly the same as the victim in \\"Quiche\\") and Agatha threatens to sell her cottage and return to London (also exactly the same). <br />I was also disappointed in the characterization of James Lacey, Agatha's next door neighbor. Sometimes he comes across as intelligent & witty and on the very next page, he is a bumbling fool, making unbelievable mistakes.<br />I will definitely pick up the third in the series, but if it does not return to the form of the first book, it will be the last of the Agatha Raisin books I will read.	2003-07-29

I was very disappointed in the first ~100 pages of this installment in the Lynley/Havers series. Neither of them appeared and the action was very very slow-moving. However, once they become involved in the story, the book is addictive and I stayed up very late one night to finish it. The character of Havers has always fascinated me and you get to see another side of her in this book, although it is almost heartbreaking to see it. Once again, George has created characters that are so dimensional in their personalities that you can empathize with them, hate them, curse them, and praise them all at the same time - with the exception of the Eve Bowen character who is nothing but a politician in all her actions, professional and personal. Another great read!	2003-06-29

I had hesitated because I am really fond of Bruce Alexander's Sir John Fielding mysteries and thought it would pale in comparison. I was very pleasantly surprised in that while it is indeed similar to Alexander's series, it actually improves on it in some aspects. I like the protagonist very much as he is a level-headed and fair-minded individual, something rare in that particular era. And I fell in love with Lucy and hope that she will appear in the future books although it might be heard to weave her into any more storylines. This is a great read and looking forward to the second in the series.	2003-06-08

I have been putting off reading the other two mystery series written by Elizabeth Peters as I enjoy the Amelia Peabody series so much that I thought I would be disappointed. And, surprisingly, I was not disappointed at all in this, the first of the Jacqueline Kirby mysteries, first published in 1972. Kirby is not an instanly likeable character but she grew on me as the book continued. The mystery is classic Peters in that it involves some rather arcane references which always end up tying into the mystery somehow. I was able to figure out how the main clue to the criminal works into the plot but was not able to figure out who that criminal was as Peters keeps a vital piece of information from the reader until the denouement. This is a quite enjoyable mystery, quicker to read than the Amelia Peabody mysteries, and I look forward to buying and reading the second in the series.	2003-05-28

I really enjoyed the first one and, while I enjoyed this one as well, there were two things that disappointed me; one, the motive for the murder just did not wash with me. I cannot see anyone murdering someone for the reason given. And two, the manner in which the murderer is actually caught is almost ludicrous. I cannot imagine the policemen missing such an obvious thing. Then, after the murderer is captured, the police continue searching for him (you will understand what I mean when you read the book). So, while this book is enjoyable and recommendable, I have to say that I will hesitate on buying the next one in the series.	2003-05-23

I found it better written and the main character better developed, but maybe it just took a second book for the author to really define Juliet's personality. In this episode, Juliet's babysitter disappears and she feels responsible for finding out what happened to her. Her search leads her to the Hassidic community of New York and back to L.A. The book is interesting in its cultural descriptions in addition to the mystery itself. The only complaint I have is that the ending seemed rushed, as it did actually in the first book of this series; however, other than that, it was a fun and fairly quick read.	2003-05-21

First, I have to say that this is not a detective novel; at least, not in the traditional sense of having a murder take place at the end of the first chapter and then the rest of the book is spent by the detective solving the mystery. This is more of a novel with some snippets of mysteries thrown in for good measure. The writing style appears to be simple but as you read on, you realize that the prose is deceptively simple. There are layers beneath the surface that give an unexpected depth to the book. I find Precious Ramotswe, the \\"lady\\" of the Ladies' Detective Agency, to be an incredibly interesting character. She has suffered with a bad husband (now ex), the loss of a child, and the loss of a beloved father but is strong throughout and keeps her humanity intact. I cannot wait to read the further adventures.	2003-05-10

I picked up this first in the series based on the recommendation here on Amazon and the fact that I had read some other Diane Duane books, particularly her entries in the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. Having read the Harry Potter books (who hasn't?), I naturally had a preconception that this would be similar, with the teenagers learning and performing spells, etc. And while that is true to a point, I found this book much darker in its tone and the magic is much more serious than most of the things done by Harry & Co. And having said that, I cannot honestly say that this is a book that I will read again as I have the Potter series. However, I did enjoy this book once I became accustomed to the seriousness of it and learned to see the subtle humor sprinkled throughout the book. I will definitely pick up the rest of the series!	2003-05-08

I have truly enjoyed the adventures of Amelia Peabody and family. This book, at least for me, was a change of pace in that there is quite a bit less action in it than previous books; I think Amelia uses her umbrella as a weapon only once throughout the entire book. And, there is less, in fact hardly any, attention paid to the excavation work being done. Having said that, there is still plenty to interest the reader as always. Approximately half of the book is devoted solely to Ramses and Nefret which was nice for a change and the mystery is intriguing as always. Just a couple more books in this series to read and then I will have wait for the annual publication of the next one and the next and the next....	2003-05-08

One of the blurbs on my edition of this book states, &quot;Today's best American mystery writer.&quot; I usually take such things as hyperbole but in this case, the reviewer may be right as I would certainly place Ms. Langton in the top three along with Elizabeth George and Elizabeth Peters. In this entry, Homer and Mary are helping with two mysteries, one involving an old student of Mary's and the other involving Mary's niece Anna who has just built a new house. Of course, the two different mysteries become one eventually. As always, the antics of Homer are fun to read and how Mary puts up with him, I will never figure out. I have read all but one of the Homer &amp; Mary mysteries and am trying to find a copy of the one I have not read. I would recommend starting with this series from as close to the beginning as you can as the progression of the relationship between the two main characters is important.	2003-04-16

The Blues, along with their 20-year-old son, are on a tour of France with several professors and dean candidates from the university. Accidents start to happen and while Carolyn at first thinks them just that - accidents - she soon comes to realize that a pattern is developing.<BR>Nancy (Herndon) Fairbanks uses a technique that I remembered also being used in a Marion Babson book in which the guilty party writes in a journal (although perhaps in the Babson book, it was a matter of hearing the culprit's thoughts, not necessarily a diary) and that helps the reader narrow the field of potential guilty persons down as the culprit refers to other members of the travelling party, thus eliminating several suspects.<BR>All in all, an enjoyable read although a bit confusing at first with the introduction of all the characters.	2003-04-15

There is not much of a mystery and the author uses a plot that I have read before in another mystery with regards to how the murderer attempts to get by with his/her crime. This particular book is more of a chapter in the life of the village rather than a mystery as more time and words are spent on the daily trials and tribulations of WW II life in small-town England than the mystery itself. I had almost decided not to buy this book after the last one, but am glad I did and will definitely buy the next installment. I do have to say, as I said in my review of the previous book, that once again, there are typos in the book. Berkley Prime Crime, do you not have spellcheck?	2003-03-25

Having read the previous Lynley/Havers mysteries by Elizabeth George, I have come to expect nothing but the best from her and this book did not disappoint. I am always amazed at Ms. George's ability to weave multiple storylines into a coherent, fascinating, enjoyable story. Another thing that occurred to me while reading this book is that all of George's characters have some redeeming quality(ies), even the murderer, because she understands that nothing and no one is simply good or bad, but rather varying shades of grey. And so it is in this compelling mystery involving a mother/daughter separated for years, a husband/wife also separated and a mother dealing with a verbally abusive teenage son. For each of the characters, you feel empathy, sympathy, dislike (at times bordering on loathing), love, and compassion. I have already bought the remaining books in this series and am now trying to figure a way to stop myself from reading them too quickly!	2003-03-25

As well, I have thought a few times that their (Nicci French is the pseudonym for a husband-and-wife writing team) dialogue can be be weak sometimes. I think that this book improves on both of those issues. The story moves along at a rapid pace and I find the dialogues much more convincing that in previous books. However, I have a different complaint with this book and it seems, from reading other reviews, that I am not the only one to feel this way. The ending is weak and left me with a slight bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it seems as if a writer reaches a certain wordcount in a book and says, &quot;Ok, that's it. Let's wrap this thing up now.&quot; But, the ending is not so weak that it takes away from the enjoyment of reading the book; in fact, I almost wish that they would write another book involving the main character from this one, Dr. Kit Quinn. And, I hope the other Nicci French books become available for U.S. readers soon for their sake.	2003-02-21

The characters in this one are much more believable and the situations much more real-to-life. This episode revolves around a local judge getting a poison pen letter threatening her with exposure of a dark secret, about which she hasn't a clue. Ms. Daheim interweaves the current mystery with snippets from the past involving ancestors of the current Alpine residents, particularly those about which the story includes. She does a credible job with tying it all together and there were several aspects of this particular story I liked: Ed Bronsky, a character I do not care about, appears only in one scene; the story involves mostly Emma, Vida, and Milo; Emma is getting over the death of Tom. I would recommend this series to any mystery lover.	2003-02-18

I have now, however, come to enjoy this series as much. In this episode, Judge Knott has recently broken with her semi-boyfriend  and she is assigned to a divorce settlement case in a neighboring city. One of the divorcing spouses is killed and Deborah steps in to help solve the murder. This is a bit different from the regular Judge Knott mysteries as she does not actively work on finding the culprit, rather she lets people around her gossip, watches peoples'interactions, and puts two and two together. Maron's writing, as usual, is topnotch; the mystery is easy to figure out but the book is still a winner because she always makes the surrondings and people inhabiting the book interesting. Can't wait for the next episode, \\"Slow Dollar.\\" Keep 'em coming, Ms. Maron!	2003-02-11

The main character, Jacobia, grew on me as I read further into the book, although I have to admit I did not care for her at first, thinking her to be a bit judgmental and a little whiny. I learned to appreciate her and I hope that in the following books, we can see more of her background including her financial work with some questionable characters; now that would make some interesting storytelling. I agree with a previous reviewer in that I found nothing to like about her ex-husband, and everything to like about her boyfried; in fact, I found them almost too one-dimensional (evil ex-husband & perfect boyfriend), but not so much as in many of the cookie-cutter mysteries on the market today. I will definitely be picking up the next books in the series to read in the near future.	2003-02-11

I am a very late-comer to this series, this first book having first been published in 1992. It was recommended to me by a fellow mystery lover. I truly enjoyed this book. I was less fascinated by the mystery of whodunnit than by the personality of Agatha Raisin. I found it quite refreshing that an author has written a main character that is not so very likeable, at least throughout most of the book. It was fun to see her push her way through situations and to be so brutally honest with her opinions; too often, the main character is too nice and sweet. The crime is fairly easy to solve, but that did not matter so much to me as I enjoyed the writer's style and, as stated already, Agatha Raisin. I will definitely be buying the rest of the series.	2003-02-11

I am always excited to buy the new one and delve into it. This one did not disappoint me. The mystery begins when Goldie's living room window is shot out in the middle of the night, then Tom is shot, and there are mysterious ghost-like happenings occurring at the reconstructed medieval castle in which she is catering some events. There are plenty of red herrings thrown into the mix and plenty of oddball characters to make it interesting. I really like the fact that Diane Mott Davidson can usually write interesting characters without making them caricatures...although I have to say here that Goldie's ex-husband's new girlfriend is not written so well, being the stereotypical blond bimbo type. I also was very happy that Julian played a big part in this episode as I like him...now let's have more from Marla, Ms. Davidson. Great series!	2002-10-23

This book uses the expedition of Lewis &amp; Clark to intertwine various lives and loves. As usual with Homer Kelly books, the reader knows the culprit, or at least knows who did NOT do the crime(s). This book contains some rather brutal murders, although the subject is handled in the usual Langton finesse. Homer and Mary do not figure so very much in this episode, with much of the action centering on guest characters. It is, as always, well-written, and, also as always, the pencil drawings by the author add to the enjoyment of reading this book. All in all, this is a fine addition to the series and I am looking forward to reading the next.	2002-10-23

Elizabeth Peters has created, over the years, characters that are so 3-dimensional that they become almost real in the reader's mind. In this particular episode, WW I has begun and its affects are being felt in Egypt as with most other parts of the world. I found this book particularly impelling because of the way in which Ms. Peters treats subject of the war - showing the affects without actually taking the reader into the battlefields. The premise of the book is that Ramses is a coward, refusing to fight; that misconception is soon righted for Amelia, Emerson, etc. although they never believe that he is a coward, anyway. The book moves along at the usual Peters-pace and the ending is fantastic. Have already purchased the next book in the series and look forward to many more exploits with these characters who have almost become friends to me.	2002-10-21

They follow the same pattern in that the police rarely play a major role and the reader usually knows &quot;whodunnit&quot; from the beginning. This book follows in the same manner. What makes Ms. Babson's writing so enjoyable is that no matter who the main character is, in this case an 11-year-old boy, she is able to make him/her believable. She knows exactly what the reactions would be appropriate for the profile of the character. I particularly enjoyed this book because I liked the main character, Robin. The way in which he protects the cat, going so far as to dye and cut its fur among other things, made me want to root for him. Looking forward to the next book from this imaginative author.	2002-10-21

Sarah Brandt's neighbor's son is accused of murder and she, of course, must help find the real murderer to help her neighbor. The mystery in this one is easier to solve than previous mysteries and there were times that I could not understand why neither Sarah nor her policeman friend Frank Malloy could not see what I thought was obvious. The reason that they don't may have to be the time period in which these mysteries take place - the culprit is hiding himself in a manner that was unthinkable. <BR>There is some movement in the personal side of Sarah and Frank's relationship as well, which I found as interesting as the mystery itself. I am looking forward to the next in the series.	2002-06-26

I have found that Deborah Crombie always delivers with her books. There is so much to recommend this book: the writing itself is first-rate, the characterizations are spot-on, the mystery is intriguing, the subject matter is different from any other mystery I have read. And that brings up an interesting point - after I finished reading this book, I realized that the subject matter of unconscious writing did not distract from the mystery itself. I think that with most other writers I would have found myself distracted by thinking about the subject, wondering whether I could believe in it or not, etc. While reading this book, I simply accepted it as truth and I think that says something for Ms. Crombie's writing. She makes it easy to accept what you are reading without drawing attention to the fact that it might be a little \\"out there.\\"  This is not the best in the series as that would still have to be \\"Dreaming of the Bones,\\" but this book is far above most any other mystery you will find on the storeshelves today.<BR>Can't wait for the next in the series, \\"And Justice There is None.\\"	2002-06-26

I read both series written by Mary Daheim and I have to say, right away, that I prefer the Alpine Mysteries to this series, Bed-and-Breakfast. This series tends toward too much silliness at times and there also tends to be too many deaths in each one (Snow Place to Die, for example, was right up there on par with a slasher movie). As well, some of the guests in this series lean toward stereotypical cartoons rather than characters. That being said, this book falls right in line with the others of the series, perhaps a little worse than most of the previous ones. Both Judith and her cousin Renie are in the hospital for operations when a murder occurs, following two suspicious deaths having already taken place. The mystery in this one is fairly easy to solve and the pacing is slow - it would take a really strong writer to make a full-length novel that takes place almost entirely in one hospital room seem exciting. I found myself more interested in the personal progress of Judith's life - will Mike finally find out that Joe is his father, not Dan? How is Gertrude's progress into senility? <BR>I rate this one 2 stars as it is less than average for this series. Have to say that I am more looking forward to the next Alpine mystery much more than the the next one in this series, \\"Silver Scream.\\"	2002-06-26

It is not written as well as the first two, nor  as well as the first series that she wrote. The answer to the murder is obvious, the secondary mystery's answer is obvious as well. There is little, if any, progress in the relationship between Lady Elizabeth and Major Monroe which is another disappointment. And, finally, the printing of the book itself, is frustrating. There are typos throughout the book which I always find annoying. I hope the next book in the series is better than this one.	2002-06-26

I enjoy this series as much as the Death on Demand series she writes and am always glad to see a new one coming out. In this episode, Henrie O is recovering from an illness and attends her former son-in-law's wedding on a resort island. A murder occurs and, of course, Henrie O works to solve the mystery. As always, Hart's writing is dead-on; her characterizations are excellent, there are clues to help the reader along without giving the solution away easily, and the descriptions of the surrondings are vivid enough to make the reader feel as if s/he knows where s/he is.<BR>Hart's next book is a Death on Demand book and I hope that the next one will be another Henrie O. It is nice to have the break between the episodes of the two series.	2002-06-26

Someone had recommended it to me and I am glad she did. There is plenty to like about this mystery: the characters are well-formed without any of them being made too crazy or stereotypical, the main character is likeable without being a goody-goody, the mystery itself is interesting and not very easy to solve, although there are clues provided to help without being obvious. As well, there are some red herrings provided to complicate the mystery. The writing itself is competent; in fact, above average for a series of this type. I have ordered the second in the series, \\"Murder with Puffins\\" and am really looking forward to reading it.	2002-06-26

I am glad, however, that I did.<BR>Both husband and wife, Carolyn and Jason Blue, take part in solving this mystery and I like both characters. Jason was not an essential part of the first book. The mystery, revolving around industrial espionage, murder, and the Russian mafia, is intriguing and Nancy [Herndon] Fairbanks does a good job balancing the husband/wife interfacing, the humor, the mystery, the zany characters, and the recipes. I give it three stars rather than four because one of the articles that Carolyn Blue writes for a potential newspaper job is rather offensive to Japanese-Americans (sorry if that sounds too politically correct).<BR>I am looking forward to the third entry in the series and will definitely buy & read it.	2002-02-21

In an earlier book, you are clued in that Thomas had feelings for Deborah earlier in time. In this book, you will receive the details regarding how Deborah ended up marrying Simon rather than Thomas. As well, the mystery of Lynley's past is unveiled. I was appreciative of George's writing, as I have been with the previous three books and, just as much, appreciated the history provided as I had been curious as to that storyline.<BR>Looking forward to beginning the 5th in the series!	2002-02-19

Not only does it take place outside the normal venue, but as well, Homer plays a very small part in the book, with Mary doing most of the detecting. As usual, Ms. Langton does an excellent job of wrapping up several seemingly disparate plotlines into one tidy ending. The descriptions of Venice are interesting, although at times are rather more like a list of attractions rather than true descriptions. All in all, not the best of the series; but even when not the best, a Jane Langton book is better than most in the genre.	2002-01-25

One factor that may have played into my enjoyment is the fact that I lived in southern Indiana for quite some time (now living in Europe) so I recognized many of the locales mentioned, especially the Indiana University sites.<BR>I do have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the fact that the episodes of this series that take place in England are better than this one. I enjoy the interaction of Dorothy with the English mentality/way of life, and hope that the next book in the series returns to the UK.	2002-01-19

I had enjoyed the previous three books in this series, being the type of light mystery that makes good reading on a rainy day or on a plane. This one takes a step forward in the development of the characters as it concentrates more on Kiki &amp; Hannah, with little emphasis on the side characters (although there is some advancement in the Lauren/Detective Morgan relationship). And while the zingers keep flying with regards to Kiki's person, the sisters prove again in this book that they care deeply about each other. As to the mystery, there are enough clues in the storyline to provide you the answer as to &quot;whodunnit&quot; but they are not so obvious as to make the plot boring. Looking forward to the next episode.	2002-01-19

I was somewhat disappointed. It kept my interest long enough to want to confirm my thoughts on who committed the murders and I might even bother to buy &amp; read the second in the series; however, the writing was at times amateurish and I found myself thinking of better ways to write what I had just read. The main character is interesting [and there is the obligatory love interest], but there were times that he contradicted himself in his treatment of his superiors and the townspeople.<BR>This was enough for me to rate it four stars, but then having figured out who did it long before the end of the book, I rate it only three.	2002-01-19
