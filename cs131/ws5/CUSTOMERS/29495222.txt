After reading this book, it seems so obvious!  But don't we always want to rush in, do it all, finish fast and have everything bigger, better, faster, more?  This book clearly shows that not only is the fast way not necessary, but you're just setting yourself up for failure.  The Kaizen Way is like Aesop: The moral of the story is consistent, effective effort leads to success. <br /> <br />This is one of the few self-help books that actually makes sense, because it removes the daunting task of trying to \\"heal it all.\\" It's fantastic book and concept for improving any area of your life, be it career, relationship, physical goals, etc. I think it would be extremely useful for overcoming phobias as well. Building a slow, steady track record of small successes makes everything seem possible-- and practically guarantees long-term success. I love this book, and would gladly pay full retail for a copy. It's worth much more than that.	2005-09-25

While at times the prose is a bit flowery, I was pleasantly surprised! The book is similar to Chocolat, Like Water For Chocolate, and The Food of Love, with the author giving the foods magical qualities. The Iranian history was nicely woven into the story with a bit of drama, but no self-pity. I found the descriptions of the food, spices, and relishes to be perfectly accurate (I've been cooking Persian food for years.)   <br /> <br />Pomegranate Soup was a pleasure to read! I'm happy to see more and more Persian authors publishing their post-revolution experiences with humor, grace and quite good storytelling.	2005-09-22

I read For Matrimonial Purposes just after struggling through something similar (Madras on Rainy Days by Samina Ali, which I didn't care for) and found this one to be much better, though not great. The Village Bride of Bevery Hills by Kavita Daswani was much more fun.<br /><br />The entire book is more or less about the search for a suitable marriage partner. Period.  The main character's life in New York seemed forced--a girl who was too afraid to speak to people is suddenly writing press releases for a top fashion PR firm?  It didn't add to the story, and in fact made whatever cultural conflict Anju faced with her quest for a husband seem trivial and silly. At 33, as an employed, independent, travelling woman, she seems a bit too old to be so concerned with wanting to please Mummy and Daddy by finding a proper \\"boy.\\"<br /><br />That said, this isn't a bad book, and it is worth a read. Didn't love it, didn't hate it, and glad I read it.  The Indian traditions/culture is interesting, and I wonder how close to reality it is?	2005-08-15

But then my attention started to wane. The next 200 pages were so \\"subtle\\" (enigmatic? esoteric?) that perhaps I missed the point in my struggle to keep reading. The story seemed to slow to nearly a stop, and I got bored. I didn't particularly care about Layla, Sameer or her family.  Perhaps if I knew more about Indian culture, this book would have held my interest.  <br /> <br />It's worth a read anyway, because parts of it are interesting.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed \\"The Village Bride of Beverly Hills\\" by Kavita Daswani much more.	2005-08-10

It's fun just to look through the pages, even if you're not planning to cook that particular day.  The recipes offer something for everyone- easy soups to desserts, chocolates to fruits, meats, fish, vegetarian.  You can create fantastic dishes that look gourmet-complicated, and try new flavors without investing in a long list of weird ingredients.  If you have the basics in your pantry, you'll be able to make nearly every dish.  As for the desserts, keep a supply of heavy/double cream, as it seems to be one of the \\"3-4\\" ingredients in most dessert recipes. (Although, if you do have the cream, you'll be tempted to make a new dessert each night!)   <br /> <br />I love to cook, and have shelves of cookbooks, but this has quickly become my favorite cookbook because the recipes are both simple and gorgeous. I got my copy on sale, but it's well worth buying at any price. Enjoy.	2005-08-09

I enjoyed the slice-of-life feeling of this book.  It is a bit dismal at times, but wasn't life in a mining town mid-1940's a bit dismal anyway? <br /> <br />I didn't grasp the inaccuracies many other reviewers have noted, which could mean I was either too engrossed in the story to really notice, or I just don't know my history so well.  Though I will add: The first \\"marker\\" was probably the felt tip marker, created in the 1940's, used mainly for labeling and artistic applications.  The \\"Magic Marker\\" was first marketed in 1952. The author should have said \\"felt tip\\" I suppose, rather than \\"magic.\\"   <br /> <br />Had I disliked the story, I'm sure these inaccuracies would have really bugged me, but in this case, I don't mind enough to really notice.  <br />The book is worth a read.	2005-08-04

Okay, so \\"Pickup Lines\\" isn't exactly great literature, but it's cute. It's fun. It's a romanance-genre comedy that's a quick, easy read.  Sure, it's predictable, but I liked it. This is the kind of story that I always want to see continue, or developed into a longer book. I haven't read anything else by Holly Jacobs, but I just might look her up this summer.

Shame she didn't really come up with a good story. The whole thing just got to be kind of boring.  It just kept going on and on and on and on-- without the character really growing up or looking up or changing or evolving.  I don't know if it was supposed to cover the 10 years from age 20-30, but you'd think she'd get a clue or somehow mature.  <br /> <br />I didn't hate the book, but I didn't love it.  I'll look for other books by Melissa Bank because I like her style-- and hope for a much better storyline. Or plot. Or some character development. Or something.  There's a writer, then there's a storyteller. Maybe Melissa Bank will evolve to become both.	2005-07-22

I'm not a huge fan of gossip-lit, but was looking for a light-weight, fun summer read.  This book made me tired, as it was, for the most part, a never-ending To-Do List of menial chores for fake celebrities (\\"Jock Staupman\\" or... Jockstrap Man, yeah I geddit.) Seems like a real foolish way to make a living, without so much as a 'work-for-hire' agreement or contract. After 20+ years in the business, you'd think Heather Howard/Corki Brown would know better.  Plus, I can't imagine readily accepting abuse, assault and criminal activities--and having to haul heavy stones around a backyard. <br /> <br />The ending was weak and a bit far-fetched. <br /> <br />This book would have been so much more enjoyable if it had some depth to the job (as in, how did she get hired, how does she get clients), a true sense of the twisted, or real insider scoop about \\"the business.\\"  I've read this sort of \\"weird celebrity requests\\" expose in various magazines. <br /> <br />If you're really keen on celebritry-assistant madness, you'd be better off renting the movie \\"Swimming With Sharks\\" (1995) with Kevin Spacey.  That said, if you're not expecting a whole lot, this book is fine to take to the beach, as it doesn't require much thought.	2005-07-19

Unlike the typical chick-lit, or overblown \\"literature\\" this is very Irish in it's telling of ordinary people with more or less ordinary lives. Not everyone in town is a joy and pleasure, nor is everyone a cheery Paddy eejit.  <br /> <br />I liked this book because it didn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a story about some folks. If you've read much by Irish authors, you'll recognize this endearing quality.  Though one reviewer here complained that \\"there were too many people involved in too many petty and uninteresting affairs\\" -- isn't this exactly what real life is? As with Binchy's storytelling, there's a comfort to be found in a book where \\"uninteresting affairs\\" are exposed and explored-- aren't most of our days full of petty and uninteresting affairs?  <br /> <br />After all, not everyone works at a fashion magazine, dresses in Prada, and single-handedly saves the world (London) from fashion faux pas while gulping down G&T's, and romancing the cute boy. <br /> <br />I like Maeve Binchy but I found \\"Tara Road\\" and \\"Scarlet Feather\\" to be flat and predictable.  Sharon Owens, a talented first-time author, offers a fresh take on the simple and cozy. Enjoy it.	2005-06-29

This 10-year old book was weak, and with so many references to HIV/AIDS, rather dated.  The characters lacked any real development or, well, character. By the end of the book, I really didn't care if they remained friends (or why they would- they had nothing in common to be \\"friends\\", and nothing going on to really call a \\"life\\".)<br /><br />Girlfriends turning 30 and wonder what life is about?

Jones is a funny, spoofy, silly novel that's just sheer fun. <br />This is a dreary, whiney, poor-malcontent-me book that doesn't seem to have a point. <br />A twenty-something with so many luxuries, an advanced college degree, parents still married to each other-- and this little brat needs self-indulgent therapy AND Prozac?  Wow- what a poor relfection on the 20-somethings of today if this is as deep as they get. <br />Speaking of deep... this might have been a good book if the author had waited for maturity, and wrote it in say, 20 years. It really lacks depth or wisdom-- and just isn't funny. Unless you think yeast infections are something you need to \\"relate to\\" in a novel. <br /> <br />To sum it up, refer to page 80 (hardcover) of the book: <br />\\"It's like,\\" he says, \\"I'm reading  this and thinking, what's her problem?\\" <br />My thoughts exactly.	2005-06-05

I for one have no sympathy for moronic characters who have \\"mishaps\\" due to their own greed, ego and shallow lives.    The child's dairy was something I could have done without- way too obvious and contrived. I don't know of any 6-year old kids in the 2nd grade; I thought they were usually 7-8.    The sister is a real tramp, doing drugs and strange men right, left and center-- a role model for a child?     Claire seems to complain about everything, but yet, enjoys a lifestyle few (if any) single moms would enjoy-- free rent, private schooling, expensive activities.    I guess this whole \\"chick lit\\" genre and it's mommy-offshoots should have been put to rest long ago, because now we're just getting whatever Red Dress, Avon, Downtown Press, (et al) can crank out, with no real regard for quality stories, likeable characters or writing.

Everything she tells them about \\"herself\\" is untrue from the get-go-- perhaps the intelligent men sensed a total liar and treated her as such. <br /> <br />This book was dry, boring, very smug, and offered no real insight into anything. Her point is what? That it's hard to meet someone you like?  That all single people out there trying to meet someone nice are all a bunch of losers? <br /> <br />Well, I suppose if you're a married woman and aren't really \\"looking\\" but rather, working on a little science project, your results may not pan out.

And I mean ALL.  Been there, done that, and certainly I didn't do so with such false drama and dissatisfaction. She had the advantage of having many French-speaking friends, money, including a long-standing French bank account, a familiarity with the culture, environment and language (unlike most other people, self included) but yet, she presented the whole experience as beng bothersome, with everything an inconvenience, including the offer of a friend's spare (tiny) room.  (Can you say ingrate?) I was hoping for a sense of adventure and promise and fun and wonder, but instead, it all seemed so irritating to the woman.    <br /> <br />The book plodded along in the same vein, and perhaps should be called Grumpy Old Woman Abroad. How tetchy can one get over sheets?? Publisher mentions \\"maddening frustrations\\" -- and in my view, that's about all this book portrays. I guess I'm more disappointed because, having moved out of the country, I undrestand what it can be like-- thankfully my experience was nothing like hers. <br /> <br />Her little rendezvous with the married man was pretty pathetic, and not something to I'd want to brag about.

It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to \\"Roman young stud\\" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno. <br /> <br />I liked this book SO MUCH more than \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte\\"  - it was a fun read.	2005-03-24

It had two or three \\"FUNNY\\" entries, but the rest of the book lived up to it's promise: ordinary.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy it-- I did.  Many of the quirky/random thoughts were cute.  The concept was cute.  The accompanying photos and drawings were cute.  Over all, it was an hour well spent. <br /> <br />Given some of the really GOOD books out there that deserve a 5 star rating, an average/ordinary 3-star is perfectly fine for this one.  <br /> <br />I'd hate to think this book was nothing more than a big ego-fest for AKR, (\\"I'm SO GREAT that even my unremarkable, ordinary THOUGHTS are SPECIAL enough for a whole book!\\") <br /> <br />If the author's intent was to encourage readers to look inward and joyfully catalog our own quirks, then I'm sure many of us are already doing so after a reading.	2005-03-20

An over-blown \\"romance\\" would be an apt description. I guess I'm just fed up with shallow, self-absorbed characters like Darby and Shane who do nothing but each other, and moan (mutter!) about how they just want to be HAPPY and FULFILLED with their LIFE CHOICES, despite the piles of cash the family has. Boo hoo. <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewer- when Interpol was thrown into the mix, I returned the book to the library. It was just, well, boring, and I found nothing compelling about the main charcters, the \\"godmothers\\" (I kept thinking Golden Girls) or the whole silly premise of the \\"rules\\" (darlings.)	2005-03-07

I really wanted to like this book and was looking forward to it getting into it one long rainy weekend.  It had everything I like: food, cooking, reading, a love story-- even cute little drawings.... but I'm sorry to say it fell flat. <br /> <br />Because I don't read The New York Times, and am not a dedicated (or obsessive as the case may be) \\"foodie,\\" I don't know who Amanda Hesser is (surely a  faux pas in the world of cooking!)  <br /> <br />After getting through most of her book, I still don't know much about her.  Perhaps if I found some back issues of the New York Times Magazine, as most of the book was written in installments for it, I might have enjoyed this book more. Who is Mr. Latte? Tad? Don't really know. Who are all these friends? Don't know. Where did she train? France? Don't remember. Why did she begin take this career path? Don't know.  I was hoping for more of a STORY, and perhaps the dust jacket was misleading in it's promise of one. <br /> <br />For the most part, it was a \\"much of a muchness\\" i.e. \\"I went here, I ate that,\\"  and \\"I went there, I ate that,\\"  followed by \\"I went there and then we ate this and that.\\"  I found myself skipping over the last part of the book (the engagement party meal was as far as I could read-- I was bored) to the recipes, because the whole dinner-dining experience was getting old.  I was hoping the trips to Rome and Spain would liven things up, but it was still more \\"I went here, I ate that.\\" <br /> <br />On the recipes: I'm sure they're all very nice, but as one who just enjoys cooking from scratch, in reading this book, I began to feel like a plebeian in the kitchen because I dare to cook with \\"regular\\" extra-virgin olive oil-- disgrace! <br /> <br />I did make a salad of Red Flame seedless grapes (halved) with one perfect six-inch Persian Hothouse Cucumber (peeled and sliced paper thin), Bulgarian feta cheese white in color, hand-torn Romaine hearts rinsed in distilled water, their dampness gently spun away, and fresh lemon zest, with a secret white wine vinaigrette that can and should only be mixed en-bowl.  The sweetness of the seventeen perfectly sliced grapes is softened by the salty pungent tang of the feta cheese, with the lemon* zest zipping on the tongue in a provocatively citrus manner (*a lemon is a spiny, Asian evergreen tree widely cultivated for its yellow, egg-shaped fruit, which has a yellow aromatic rind and juicy, acid pulp. Only use the best.)  <br />BTW: This recipe isn't in the book- I made it up using what I found in my kitchen. <br /> <br />Instead of this book, I'd suggest both of Ruth Reichl's books: Tender at the Bone and also Comfort Me With Apples, both of which I enjoyed.  <br /> <br />I wanted to like this book, but frankly, it was just boring if you don't know of Amanda Hesser.	2005-02-20

You'd think that when a grown woman, mother, and wife turns 40, she'd have some backbone, but this book is too busy being \\"cute\\" and dropping New York-brand names to get a spine.

I think Lucinda Rosenfeld is a talented author, and I will look for other books by her.  That said, I found the book to be a \\"much of a muchness.\\"  In ten years, (age 16 - 26) Phoebe Fine never seemed to grow up, mature, reflect, or just grow, period.  By the 10th or 12th man, I was a bit tired of her go nowhere, do nothing, victim mentality.  I was also a bit tired of the men she chose--- never really seeing what she DID see in them.  I'd give the writing style 5-stars, and the first half of the book 4-stars, but it was too much of the same thing to be more than a 3-star book overall. <br />Certainly worth reading though.	2005-01-23

The main character Cate's habit of drinking, blacking out, and blaming the resulting consequences on booze and/or hangover is no more \\"fun\\" in a novel than it is in real life. Not once, not twice, not for the third time.  <br />I think attending AA instead of yet another snotty, self-centered \\"friend's\\" wedding would have made more sense. <br /> <br />It's a bit silly for a kindergartden teacher to be \\"scared to death\\" of a kid's booger-- I'd say consider a career change if that's the case. <br /> <br />The book's theme was drink lots, get drunk enough to pass out, attend weddings of horrible women, then act like idiot due to hangover or booze.

Author Kavita Daswani opens the door, without apologies, to a fascinating part of Indian culture-- arranged marriages.  The main character, Priya, was likable. While her in-laws were a pain, they weren't so bad that I hated them, and instead accepted them and their traditional ideas at face value.  The book was a fun, easy read, and well written.  I find myself re-thinking parts, and realizing the subtleties I mised at first read. <br /> <br />While the Hollywood Insider job may not sound plausible to some, I was willing to see it as simply a good example for illustating the point of work vs. family vs. \\"good Indian girl\\" vs. being free to make one's own choices. <br /> <br />I look forward to more from Kavita Daswani.	2004-12-17

I've tried to read it three times, but I just can't seem to get going.  The continual headers every two-three paragraphs are like tiresome stop signs-- they distract, interrupt, and ruin any sense of continuity.  Annoying, and meaningless! Either this book has ADD, or the author is so used to writing brief TV skits that writing an entire flowing, cohesive chapter proved to be too much-- and pointing out that fact every two paragrpahs with a new little header is a turn off.

The only reason I kept reading it was to see how much worse it could get. <br />The character (Lily) has but two brain-cells, both arguing with one another! On one hand, she hasn't a clue how to respond to a somewhat awkwardly given compliment, then claims to know all the \\"socially appropriate responses that she had been force-fed since infancy\\", then again is unable to write a simple thank-you note.  I was on page 185 and STILL didn't know what her problem was.<br />Aside from a ridiculous story line (I don't want to get married but I'll pretend I do, then get a divorce) and paper-doll characters, why oh why does the author feel the need to quote, and match bits of history and world events on every third page? <br />In \\"describing\\" a hotel: \\"an American cousin of the Paris landmark in which Ernest Hemingway spend the first days after the liberation and Marcel Proust ate chilled melon at midnight with Leon-Paul Frague.\\" <BR>Other examples littered throughout: Jim Burden in My Antonia; General Giap and Vietnam; North American Free Trade Agreement;  Sioux outnumbering the Seventh Calvary at Little Big Horn;  Janet Cooke and the Washington Post.. etc. etc. etc.  <br />These references somehow relate to Ohio life and wedding planning?  Is Lily (or could it be the author herself?) just so so so much more intelligent, self-important, and superior, she can compare her (mother's choice of) candied almonds to the Donner Party's fate?<br />I don't find any romance or comedy in this book. <br />Though I've not read much Jane Austen, I certainly couldn't stomach it after suffering through the never-ending quotes and references.
