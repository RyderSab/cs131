He is more deserving of recognition than many poets of our time who have received more. His is a quiet and sparse voice, not redundant with words, but musical with economic expression, sometimes elliptical, but always ultimately accessible when one follows his intelligence to where it leads us on \\"the other side of the poem.\\" He takes us to where mystery exists in reality. There is nothing soft-headed or occult herein, but the blunt reality of our lives as we seem like aliens trapped on earth and ruling it, often poorly, with greed, obsession, and fallacy. Seidman is worth reading, and his work will make you want to be that somebody who stands up and sings. This is a poet of truth and conscience, who thinks deeply and sings intelligently, one with whom we can share our wounded and struggling humanity.	2005-08-02

DON'T TELL MAMA from Viking or FROM THE MARGIN from Purdue U Press are better represenations of the top Italian American authors. Authors like Daniela Gioseffi, Ben Morreale, Gioia Timpanelli or Maria Mazziotti belong here more than some who are represented. And, Tonelli, a jerk about the Mafia stereotype and a fan of the horrible defamatory Sopranos ought to be tarred and feathered and ousted from his own community for representing the over glut of Mafia stories perpetuated by a myth that refuses to recognize the most important fact about Italian American culture; There is no more percentage of organized crime among Italian Americans than any other ethnic group. less. than .01 % of Italian Americans are involved in organized crime and there is no big international Mafia cartel of Italians involved in crime. That was a myth perpetuated by certain powers to make a scape goat for syndicated crime. The S &amp; L scandal of white collar crime on Wall St. and the Enron, Anderson debacle are still the greatest crimes of theivery committed in the history of the world. Hollywood and television have deliberately tried to scapegoat Italians to keep the eye off the real international criminals, and Tonelli should know better than to represent this theme at all. He is a fool for falling for this social engineering and it mars his book horribly, along with the fact that he leaves some of the best writers of all out. Other books on this subject have done a better job, and how can the reviewer from BOOK LIST get away with such nonsense, by saying the culture that produced Michaelangelo, which is the mainland Italian culture, did not produce a Shakespeare? Where has that reader been that he hasn't heard of Dante, the predated, rival of Shakespeare and the great world writer of Italian literature and culture--a different matter than Italian American immigrant culture. Tonelli and his misguided reveiwers show their ignorance. though Tonelli does well to include Mario Puzo's THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM mistitled in the first media review above. It is Puzo's best and truest book --much better than The Godfather, according to Puzo and all his literary critics, too. So read it instead while we send Tonelli back to the drawing boards to do a better job of representing his culture.  He's an upstart who really doesn't know how to edit a good book on his subject. And his professional reviewers at top make  factual mistakes and don't really know the subject well enough to write a true reveiw.	2003-12-03

Unfortunately, it seems that David Lehman's flip style of nonsense poetry of unimportance and clever witty self-involved and boring poetry has permeated the collections for 2001 and 2002. Both last year's, supposedly edited by Robert Hass, hard to believe,  and this 2002 volume, supposedly edited by Robert Creeley, also hard to believe, are full of David Lehman's silliness, his air-headed cleverness. Lehman is no judge of great poetry, and very much wedded to the light-weight qualities of the New York School of poetry, i.e. those who think, for one example, that Anne Waldman can write when words are definitely not her medium! There is not enough good, solid poetry in either of these volumes, and too many supposedely experimental,   witticism that float off to nowhere. Time will show that David Lehman's taste had a terrible influence, along with Bush's light-weight Billy Collin's, on the current years of American Poetry--not at all in the tradition of our greats, i.e. Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Galway Kinnell, Allen Ginsberg, June Jordan,  Edna St. Vincent Millay, Denise Levertov, etc., but in the tradition of his clique and &quot;in&quot; crowd who will be on the outs of the final reckoning. Under his editorship, the series has become NOT the Best American Poetry despite a few good poems here and there and too much airy, worthless wit.	2003-06-30

I'll take Vanzetti's prose and poetry over Vitiello's any day. His poetry simply is not poetic and carries no energy or engagement. What a pity!

This book couldn't be more timely--especially the chapter on &quot;War as Religion, &quot; and the &quot;Ecstacy of War.&quot; She describes perfectly the jingoism afoot today and the made fervor for war on all sides with psychological insight. This book is more timely than ever--a must read at this juncture in our U.S. history as Afghan civilians are bombed in order to capture and destroy terrorist criminals who will not be rounded up adequately by bombs. In a war that should be fought with diplomacy and intelligence and United Nations ground troops, the bombing is counterproductive and creates more enemies and terrorists. Living during a war which is greatly about military profiteering and oil reserves near the Caspian Sea, one finds all the answers for the madness of our time and the bloodbath of our history in Erenreich's insightful pages.

Moore's position as a well to do WASP on the art scene and her patronage of arts has earned her a place in poetry which is not deserved by her modicum of talent. She should stick with patronage of the arts and not attempt to invade the artist's domain. For one example, her poem on nuclear holocaust, lacks all sincereity as it shows no knowledge of the reality of nuclear war, and no understanding of the science of what it would mean. It falls flat. Her understanding of AIDS is more compelling, as this subject seems to be something she knows a bit about.  Moore is a poor poet and a better prose writer. Her tone is false and language lacks depth and sincerity. She should stick with her modicum of talent for prose and writing about her famous ancesters, and stay out of the poetry world where her work always falls flat and sounds dull in tone. Her use of forms is forced and her musical ear lacking. There are better poets to spend time with who deal with subjects like these. Memoir-Poems was not worth the price.

I found other Italian American Writers who were far more exciting, John Ciardi, Emanuel diPasquale, Felix Stefanile, Dorothy Barresi, Daniela Gioseffi, Donna Massini, W.S. diPiero, Sandra Mortola Gilbert, so many good ones-- and they are all more influential in American poetry than Mazziotti Gillan who seems to have been schooled in poetry of the past rather than the present or the future. She takes no risks and no leaps. There is nothing new here at all. No doubt the other reviwers here are friends and associates who sympathize with her simple craft and dull art. Her subject matter lacks universality, and that is the problem.

Since this is the author's only book of poetry, I'd classify this work as the work of a minaturist who has nothing to say about the larger aspects of this troubled world. I'd hoped for more concern about the issues of our time as they relate to New Jersey, one of the state's most faced with environmental disasters and pollution problems. I'd expected some real sense of life in New Jersey and why the Northwest area of which he writes is so in need of natural preservation as it becomes daily more innundated with ugly developments of houses that all look alike and sport no trees. I'd hoped for something more vital than what seems lazy, provincialist concerns. These are quiet, lazy, little verses that barely wake us from slumber in unimaginative language--rather colloquial. There's a bit of sardonic wit, but not much else, except as the author relates here and there to the sorrow of his divorce or the sadness of death. Then he strikes a note of poetic angst which isn't altogether bad.	2001-05-11

John Ciardi was an interesting man who had to buck the ethnic prejudices of his time. The adventures of his life in poetry are well worth reading. Edward Cifelli is an skilled writer of this poet's life and he has done an excellent job of weeding out the truth and balancing his portrayal so that we love Ciardi, even while we see his human foibles. He creates emapthy for his subject without going overboard, so that his words are thoroughly believable and offer a measured truth of the man and his fine accomplishements.An excellent portrait of the poet's times, too, and the issues that confront a poet in America!	2001-05-11

Her poetry does not rise to the truly poetic. She needs to go back to square one and study the really good Italian American poets like Felix Stefanile, Diane DiPrima, John Ciardi, Daniela Gioseffi, Donna Masini, Joseph Parisi, Dana Gioia, Maria Fama, so many others, who can write with more than old-fashioned violin strings. I had a real desire to like the book, but I was disappointed. These other authors are highly recommended reading, evenif this Italian American poet falls rather flat. There are really norisks here. The language is pedestrian. Nothing original. Que piccata! What a pity!	2000-11-27

Once again, reading Charles Bernstein is a wasted intellectual exercise. Berbstein's theories about language are old hat, too. Jackson MacLow and many others beat him out for originality long ago. It is a pity to see that people like Marjorie Perloff, coming from the &quot;Gertrude Stein School,&quot; so to speak, can be so fooled by Berstein's nonsense. He wastes paper with his over done, old hat experiments. Stein beat him to the things he attempts, too, and in a more interesting whimsical fashion. If one really wants to read about language and its implications, one does better to read Noam Chomsky. The thing is that Chomsky at least never pretends to be a poet, and at best, tops Bernstein for true intellectual power. Charles Bernstein would do well to attempt to really communicate some experience of life on THIS planet, not just his bookish attitudes. His claim to any originality is arrogant. We poets were all doing these sort of experiments all through the 1960's and 1970's before we decided to really write in order to communicate. Gertrude Stein and Jackson MacLow were our leaders, along with the French Dadaists and Symbolists, like Rimbaud. American poetry simply does not need Bernstein's influence or theories at this juncture. He sets things back, not forward. This silly emperor really has not clothes and it doesn't take a child to see it. We grown up poets know it two. And, we must tell the truth from the rooftops to save other younger poets from this foolery with l-a-n-g-u-a-g-e.	2000-11-27

There are some excellent writers included, but many who should be here are not included. There are much better books that do what this one attempts to do, as for example KALEIDESCOPE: Stories of the American Experience from Oxford University Press. Also, available at the marvelous Amazon.com. KALEIDESCOPE by the Perkins which preceded this book in multicultural pioneering is more varied in theme and does all that the Gillan's attempt to do, only better. I recommend it as an anecdote to this collection, as it provides more subtelty and variety of tone. The Gillans seem to be best at whining when they edit a collection. Still, some of the stories taken individually are excellent, but all stuffed into one binding to make the Gillans sell books, they have a one note tone. Try KALEIDESCOPE instead. It shimmers in a better American light than this copy cat collection.	2000-11-27

What a shame that such a cultured and intelligent woman should waste her time and talent in such drivel. Jorie Graham and Helen Vendler from whose covoluted cranium she was born, truly deserve to go down to the &quot;Ninth Circle of Hell&quot; together.  Vendler declares openly that she has never belonged to anything or voted in an election for anyone and she should be ashamed of herself for that. To make no political statement is to be a &quot;Pontius Pilot&quot;--a self involved act that is political in its denial. This is selfish and uncommitted, hallow, straw-man's poetry. The sort of convoluted nihilism and over intellectualized theorizing about language, poetry, and art of which this book is born is a detriment to all poetry and its readership. This sort of hopelessly abstract book will help to toll the death nell for American poetry's readership. It's utter foolery and we are not fooled. There is nothing here for anyone human. An experiment is supposed to discover something. This experiment, if it is one, discovers nothing. Que piccata! A wasted talent! A wasted effort at publishing.	2000-10-29
