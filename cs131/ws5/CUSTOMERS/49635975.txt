The authors strike the right balance between theory and evidence, history and geography. However, their main contribution is the areas they cover (i.e. global politics, military globalization, global trade and markets, global finance, multinational corporations and global production networks, globalization and migration, cultural globalization, environmental globalization). The authors state at the beginning that they will concentrate on 6 states (France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, UK and USA), however, they are not able to fulfill this self-imposed constraint. This book does not cover globalization as perceived in the developing word.  <br /> <br />They don't explicitly propose either a specific theory or their own view, but they muse with their topic and look at it through different lenses.   It is not a readerly text, but an open text that invites interpretations and critical thinking. However, this does not mean that the authors were pursuing a full-fledged post-modern approach, even if here and there the authors give rise to such suspicion.  <br /> <br />The authors analyze globalization as a process, therefore it is difficult to predict where it will lead us. It is a historical process that cannot be characterized by an evolutionary logic. However, globalization is not a wholly novel phenomenon, but its intensity has increased. The authors come to prefigure that the current phase of globalization is not going to erode state power or cause \\"the end of politics\\" like the end of the Cold War didn't mean \\"the end of history\\". Globalization has not altered the absolute autonomy of states, but interactions among states have changed and become more complex. A question still remains: How can globalization be \\"civilized\\" and democratized? <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended to all who consider globalization as a defining principle of our time.  <br />	2005-10-03

Visual learner will find great advantage out of this approach. However, this is only an overview and does not add more than that compared to any other book of ancient Roman history. As a previous reviewer has noticed, the battle of Pharsalus was in Thessaly and not in Thrace as mistakenly placed by the author at page 32. Thrace is mainly in today Bulgaria, but overlaps also Turkey and Greece. Thessaly is in central Greece.  However, to give Caesar what is Caesar's, another reviewer allegedly claimed to have discovered a mistake at page 16 related to the Temples of Castor and Pollux. In fact, the Penguin's text is correct: the temples were rebuilt by Tiberius (before he became emperor), under Augustus. Augustus adopted Tiberius, who later became Emperor.  The practice of adopting would-be emperors was a pragmatic way to ensure a suitable persona for Rome, instead of a inept natural son.  <br /> <br />However, the book does not cover the Eastern Roman Empire (lasting for further more centuries) after the fall of the western part. Moreover, the author does not provide useful maps concerning the pressure from barbarians on the borders. Goths were Germanic tribes that moved from the Baltic sea to the Black sea, but this Atlas does not mention it. Why and where the pressure along the borders was mounting is not satisfactorily mentioned either. It is a shame for an historical atlas.     <br />	2005-09-07

Their brutality was recorded in chronicles from their victims (literate clergymen), and in part their ill fame is probably the result of bad press of that time.  <br />History needs maps. An historical atlas is very useful if a reader wants to keep track of all Viking raids and pillages around the coasts of northern Europe, but also as far today Russia and Central Asia. Vikings gave the name to Russia, being Rus the name Finns gave to Swedish Vikings in that area, which means \\"oarsmen\\". So this historical atlas provides plenty of information through maps and entertaining captions that help to understand how far-reaching Viking influence was. However, this atlas, as a previous reviewer has noted, is too centered on Viking presence in British islands and Ireland.     <br />At the beginning of the X century, Charles III of France gave Normandy (the land of Norse) to the Vikings, who in turn offered their allegiance. These settled Vikings became known as Normans, who took part to new adventures: William, the Duke of Normandy, led the conquest of England, Robert the Guiscard seized Sicily from Muslims in the Mediterranean, and took part in the Crusades. This by-product of the Viking saga is almost completely left out.  <br />All in all, this atlas provides a visual history of Vikings, that is appropriate and easy to read for students and the general reader. Recommended to all who share an interest in Medieval history of Northern Europe.    <br />	2005-08-27

Diamond blends together science from a wide variety of academic fields with history, making geography a living and appealing subject.  Without indulging in oversimplifications, the author develops a discourse as to how environmental factors have played an important role in the demise of now lost civilizations. Not always that fate was self-inflicted, but their leaders' inability to have a fresh look at what was really happening around them, made the final blow inevitable. The collapse of societies is explained by five contributing factors: 1) environmental deterioration caused by natural resources mismanagement; 2) climate changes; 3) hostile neighbors; 4) relationships with trade partners; and 5) the society's response to its environmental problems. <br /> <br />The book is divided in 4 parts. The first part is a contemporary account of Montana's region in the US and serves as a prologue for the second part, which deals with lost communities around the world (Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands in the Pacific, the Anasazi in today New Mexico, the Maya in central America, the Norse Greenland). However, Diamond also portraits success stories of societies (New Guinea highlands, Tikopia, Japan), which were able to manage more sensibly their environment. The second part is definitively the most interesting to read for both breath and quality of information therein.  <br />Part three deals with contemporary societies and how they have coped with their environmental constraints (Rwanda, Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, Australia). This part reflects the \\"then and now\\" approach by Diamond in \\"Collapse\\" and serves the purpose to put in a contemporary context what happened in other circumstances in the past with lost civilizations. Finally, in the last part, Diamond tries to provide practical lessons for today, taking examples from the mining, oil, logging, and seafood industries.  This part is frankly a little pedantic and provides a morale too easy to grasp for any public that it could have been safely omitted. In fact, the first three parts are self-explaining and would have left some room to the reader for critical thinking. It is also the part less fully developed and more generic and could give rise to claims that the book is one-sided pro-environment and anti-business. This is obviously not the case in the first parts of the book, in which arguments are actually well balanced and nuanced.  However, the lessons from the book are obvious, but the practical steps proposed by Diamond are a little superficial and lack a firm base in political science and environmental economics. Leaders and citizens are driven by short term interest and motives, and in such conditions non-cooperative behaviors are dominant strategies (the tragedy of the commons quoted throughout the book is only the simplest example). Diamond wanted to end the book with an optimistic note and we are glad for that.    <br />The book is highly recommended to all, both the general reader and the concerned citizen. It also provides useful thought provoking hints for more professional readers in history and social sciences.  <br />	2005-08-20

First published in 1978 when economics of information was taking shape, this book falls within the realm of public policy with economic analysis foundations of strategic complementarities and expectations. Game theory makes some appearance here and there, after all Schelling first defined the concept of \\"focal point\\" in its previous work \\"The Strategy of Conflict\\". It does not require much economics or mathematical background to appreciate it. It is instead logic applied to patterns that are recognizable in real life. The leit-motif of the book can be defined as coordinating coordination failures in a wide range of social behaviors, that will become a standard tool in economics later in the 80s thanks to Russell Cooper and Andrew John, and in other social sciences, too. To quote a selected passage from this book: \\"there are at least two respects in which an ability to choose chromosomes might be unwelcome. One is that some of the things that we might be most motivated to choose have the quality that if we all choose what we individually prefer we are all a little worse off......The other difficulty......The skinny boy whose mother insists on violin lessons may wonder whether he might not have been big like the other boys if his mother hadn't traded size for musical talent before he was old enough to be asked what he preferred.\\"   Other than in eugenics, Schelling provides an intuitive and stylized account of many more irrational macrobehaviors led by personal, and sometime contradictory or rational micromotives. The book is highly readable for all kind of readers and recommended to all.	2005-08-08

It is a shame that this classic for children literature is not available in a decent English translation. This story seems not very popular in the US or in other English speaking countries and it is a pity, while it is more popular in Europe where it is a classic for children. This story was written before WWI and showcases honor and an anti-war bottom line. The Boys of Pal Street depicts the life and struggle of two bands of boys for a playground. (The story of two gangs fighting for their turf  today looks like so similar to  many others in real streets in real cities of the eighties. However, children's ingenuity is the defining factor in this story).  At the beginning of the 20th century, Budapest is rapidly changing is face and the construction of new buildings is proceeding quickly. With shrinking spaces for play, a group of schoolboys has to defend its space on the last free lot in their neighborhood from a rival group, the Red Shirts. There is no alternative playground and this lot is theirs  and the Pal Street boys must defend it if they want keep on playing.  <br />Nemecsek is the youngest and the smallest boy of the Pal Street Boys and as such he plays the role of the mascot, a role too tiny for him. He is determined to show to the older guys that he is a real \\"member\\" and will prove himself.  <br />The Red Shirts is a well organized band and Nemecsek goes on his own to spy on the Red Shirts headquarters to gather information for his \\"comrades\\". He is caught and thrown into a cold lake and gets a severe cold and fever. His health worsens while his friends are ready for their frontal against the Red Shirts. On the day X, despite his bad health (no penicillin at that time!) Nemecsek cannot leave his older comrades alone while he is resting in bed, then he leaves home to join his friends. The Pal Street boys eventually prevail, but Nemecsek's conditions worsen even further and his friends have to take him home, where Nemecsek will die the very same day. Nemecsek will die for nothing since few days later  the construction of new buildings in their camp begins. Double sad ending. Highly recommended for all, if you can find a copy.  <br />	2005-08-07

It is neither a reference book nor an introduction to U.S. legal history, but a discourse (or journey) on the evolution of law in America. It is very evocative and generates a craving for more (for that there is a nice commented bibliography). Friedman finds space to comment the system (\\"In a common law system, the judges who write the opinions are crucial and important figures. To be more precise, the law gets made by appellate judges\\"),  its procedures (The overwhelming majority of cases are never appealed to a higher court  indeed, the overwhelming majority of controversies never get to the courts at all\\") and its inhabitants (\\"Americans, it is said, are more rights conscious than most citizens of other countries; more prone to sue for damages\\"). If those appears personal views, instead they are thoroughly thought, but supporting evidence should be found elsewhere.  While this book is less than 200 pages, the number of issues dealt in the book is impressive, from slavery to punishment, from privacy to how insurance companies and other businesses have waged a campaign against excessive tort liability (famous fabricated horror stories: the psychic who got a million dollars for losing her psychic power; the woman who got millions for spilling hot coffee on herself ; the burglar who was hurt while burglarizing somebody's house, and sued the owners). A highly recommended book for all.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-06

Rich of tables, charts and histograms of different shapes and colors, it provides a basic knowledge on food industry. The book is divided into five parts: Contemporary Challenges (population and productivity, environment, consuming diseases, over and under-nutrition in the world, and food aid); Farming (mechanization, animal feed, genetic modification, pesticides, fishing, biodiversity and sustainable farming); Trade (flows, animal transport, food miles, subsidies, trade disputes, fair trade); Processing, Retailing and Consumption (staple foods, processing giants, probiotics and cholesterol lowering food, organic food, fast food, food additives, eating out and alcohol); and world tables on agriculture and consumption.

The reason lies in its subject, wealth and income distribution, that makes everyone thinks that it is a leftist subject by definition. Liberals would love it and conservatives would despise it, a priori.   Phillips does not provide a solution but tries to analyses trends through historical developments of wealth and income distribution in the United States in more than 200 years. The main theses in the book are simple to summarize.   1) The wealth distribution has been highly concentrated and that concentration has increased over time. Living standards have remarkably improved for all classes but inequality has increased substantially. In the last 30 years families' living standards have recorded a setback partially concealed by the fact that more time is spent at work, while in the rest of the world less time is spent at work with improved social services (public schools, vacation time, health plans, pension benefits and so on).     2) The historical wealthiest families had accumulated the first riches through slavery, privateer, piracy, and government procurements during wars thanks to the right connections. The heritage of that past bears its influences still today.     3) Contrary to the common rhetoric, upward social and economic mobility was and is more limited than you might think, according to Phillips' book.  You have two extremes in how the wealth is distributed. On one extreme, a society whose wealth is equally distributed, but were incentives to work more are curtailed leaving a smaller cake to share for all. On the other extreme, a society where all wealth is concentrated in one family, in which even aristocrats would complain. Phillips shows data that the latter case is dangerously close to reality.    4) Democracy and wealth are so intertwined that \\"one dollar one vote\\" is a better description than \\"one head one vote\\". Therefore the top 1% of the wealthiest families (or the top 10%) tend to use their money to keep things as they are, or improve their privileged position. Investing in legislation through lobbyists makes a better rate of return than any other investment.      Phillips provides a great deal of information, but that is not well organized, and often repetitive, leaving the reader with a sense of confusion. First, because the myth of the self-made man or the hope of upward mobility is put in question and it is less common than usually thought, generating a sort of \\"cognitive dissonance\\" in the reader (some would call it provocative or eye-opening). Secondly, the author does not provide any solution or policy prescription (of course, for those who think that there is something wrong to fix). It certainly is food for thought, but still raw that the reader should cook it by herself.      Taken for granted the above warnings, it is a recommended book for those who want a first exposure to the hot subject of wealth and democracy, now and then.	2005-08-04

The book provides a complete documentation of the general patterns of this army across Europe that if taken in isolation would seem improbable. This super secret Army was operating in all Western European countries under different codenames and coordinated  by the Allied Clandestine Committee and the Clandestine Planning Committee under the umbrella supervision of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) within the NATO and with the active supporting role of the Pentagon, CIA and the British MI6. The goal of this army was to operate behind enemy lines setting up resistance movements in case of a Soviet invasion of Europe. The secret army was clandestine and illegal in many countries and staffed by loyal anti-communist soldiers and rightwing activists recruited from various sectors, many with a past with the nazis or fascist armies during WWII. These armies have been employed also against the national communist (and in some case socialist) parties (Demagnetize Operation) under the complacence of domestic intelligence services with several suspect cases of assassinations and some documented cases of terrorist attacks against civilian targets, or in overturning democratically elected governments (Greece and Turkey) too dangerously left-leaning. Italy plays an important part in this story since Italy was theatre of several operations and last but not least, a former prime minister eventually admitted before Parliament in 1990, after the investigations of a judge, that a stay-behind army had operated since WWII, opening a Pandora's box of revelations.  To each country are dedicated 18 specific chapters (UK, USA, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria) with specific documented episodes, that offers a clarifying picture of this super secret organization. Much remains to be discovered, but the merit of this book is to have put together scattered information in a well organized way.

Poundstone covers three subjects strongly intertwined: the life of John Von Neumann, the creator of the game theory and one of the major figures in the Manhattan Project; the atomic bomb and the Cold War; finally, a non technical exposition of game theory, and much more. The most interesting part is related to the atomic bomb. Americans have got the bombs, but how many is top secret. So secret that strategists (Bertrand Russell as a public commentator) did not know and wanted to strike Soviets first before they managed to get one, too. However, the number of bombs was very limited and not enough to win. Atomic bombs were highly perishable and technology was at its infancy then. An atomic strike against the Soviets was then going to be only the opening of a new World War, but the military strategists allegedly were not aware of their weakness and the preventive war was doomed to be a big mistake. The game theoretic part of the book does not require any prior knowledge of game theory or mathematics. So this readable and fascinating book is recommended to all.	2005-07-30

The content of the book is coherent with its title: The Economics of Civil Procedure; and deals with the tools of both positive and normative economics applied to the rules of civil procedure. The orientation is only toward the US law (but can be applied universally) and the goal is to provide analytical tools. The author's academic approach is also able to fit a more policy oriented reader and provide some hints for the current debates in the US. The author tackles a) the puzzle of frivolous litigation, and if frivolous litigations really happen in US Courts; b) the puzzle of settlement, or why lawsuits seldom go to trial; c) the optimal pleading rule; d) efficiency of American vs British rule about who is going to pay the attorney's fees; e) the process of discovery; f) preclusion and the class action.

It is not for beginners and it is a tough reading. Since this textbook is for student of Islamic law written by an Islamic lawyer, this book assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of both Qur'an and Shariah.  The author is professor of law at the International Islamic University of Malaysia, founded in the 80s to be a center of excellence in several fields and sponsored by the Organization of Islamic Conference and other governments. The main language at the University is English and this text is mainly catered for those students. In the preface, the author says he had initiated the book while he was teaching Islamic Law to postgraduate students at McGill University in Montreal. However, it does not offer international comparisons with other Western legal systems. The book devotes a lot of space to the rules of interpretations of the law within a historical context. So you get Islamic law and history to explain its developments within the several traditions in the Islamic world. It is divided in 19 chapters that span from the Source of the law (Quar'an and Sunnah); Rules of interpretations; Abrogation; Analogical deduction; Revealed laws preceding the Shariah; Equity in Islamic law; Public interest; Custom; Conflict of evidences etc. The author shows a scholarly detachment from the subject and therefore don't expect moral judgments of value on a specific norm, whether it is right or wrong, but only a legal analysis. It is a worthy reading for those who have an interest, other than in Islamic law, in Political Science, International relations and Islamic civilization.	2005-07-27

The author is a well-known statistician who has also a gift as historian. The book is a collection of essays on the development of the main ideas in Statistics. These essays are not in chronological order and overlap on several points. That can create some confusion in the reader. The first essay is about the controversy on the effect of parents' alcoholism on children between Karl Pearson and the Cambridge economists (A. Marshall, J.M. Keynes, A. Pigou). While Pearson expected harsh criticism from the medical profession he was unexpectedly broadsided by economists on the ground of logic instead of data. Pearson's response was: statistics on the table, please. The book goes on clarifying the developments of the main ideas in the field: Central Limit Theorem, Normal distribution, least squares, degrees of freedom, regression, Bayes's Theorem, and so on. It also provide the role of famous mathematicians like Gauss, Laplace, Legendre and others. However, Pearson, Galton and Edgeworth maintain a high visibility in the book.  It is not a reference book of the historical development of ideas and intuitions in Statistics, and few chapters reflect more the interest of the author than the coherence with the title \\"Statistics on the Table. The History of Statistical Concepts and Methods\\" like in Statistics and Standards, and The Trial of the Pyx, or Apollo Mathematicus. Outstanding and funny is the chapter Stigler's law of Eponymy, which states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. It is definitively an enjoyable reading and I strongly recommend it to whoever has an interest,  weak or strong, in the subject.	2005-07-27

Johnson's book is an interesting reading for whoever is interested in international affairs. The title is too catchy for the content of the book. Blowback is the word used within the CIA to mean that something is having the wrong result. The subtitle alludes to the costs of American Empire. However, this book is not about CIA or espionage, and it does not blame Imperialism, either. The main thesis of the book is that military or economic powers have an international policy (of course, they have one), but that parts of that broad international policy, when not thoroughly studied, can have unintended consequences, and the people most affected can retaliate. The book goes on with many examples to refresh our memory. It is interesting that the book was first published in year 2000.  A very interesting reading, highly recommended to all.	2005-07-19

Constitutional law is seen through its cases throughout history and its main protagonists: the judges of the Supreme Court and those who brought their cases. It also shows that legalist interpretation of the Constitution has not followed the pedant use of syllogistic reasoning from the precedential principles set forth in previous similar cases, like Christopher Columbus Langdell, instead, had taught at Harvard Law School in the XIX century. When the Constitution was interpreted as if it were a pure and independent science, leaving nothing to the political context or the common sense, it created monsters that today look embarrassing. However, since the law was interpreted according to the sensitivities of the ruling class at the time, too, the output still remains curious today. Both ways, the Constitution was read for the benefit of the privileged. The book does not deal only with famous cases such as \\"Dred Scott v. Sandford\\", \\"Plessy v. Ferguson\\", \\"Brown v. Board of Education\\", \\"Miranda v. Arizona\\", \\"Roe v. Wade\\", but it deals with many more that cover many controversial political subjects of the last 200 years. Here an anecdote in the book that look funny in itself. Lawyers from the Dept. of Justice brought two thousand prosecutions under the Espionage Act. The most ironic is United States v. Spirit of '76, against the producer of a movie about the American Revolution, Robert Goldstein, because his depiction of British atrocities against the colonists tended \\"to question the good faith of our ally, Great Britain\\", according to the judge, who imposed a ten-year sentence on the producer.

You can find those principles, or mechanisms, in so many instances of mind manipulation (or even mass manipulation) that is incredible how we can still maintain our free will. Those mechanisms trigger in us an automatic response that we find difficult to control. However, those principles are simple tactics, and the final effect depends on how well and consistently those principles are used in a coherent strategy. Cialdini offers simple and clarifying examples of those tricks at work, but also permits to recognize a tactic of persuasion when you see it and he suggests ways as to how to say no.  <br />Cialdini discusses the basic principles, the pillars of the psychology of persuasion, but does not provide strategies that instead fall in other arts. Rhetoric will benefit from Cialdini's classifications, however, the basic tenets, dating back to Aristotle, remain valid: ethos, pathos and logos. The six principles will be helpful in negotiation, but liking and reciprocication can be necessary but not sufficient to cut corners.  <br />This book is a must read in the field, enjoyable in the writing style, and full of information and examples. Strongly recommended!  <br /> <br />	2005-07-18

It does not provide an analysis of the CIA'style or policies in carrying out its job, but it describes operations that have been conducted and the feelings of those who worked as operatives. Since the author relies on two sources of his, who have worked mainly in the Berlin Operating Base, much of the stories are centered on that area with few digressions in other parts of the world according to postings of his sources. The book develops its arguments on different levels and with exhausting flashbacks, so the reader has to go back and forth to disentangle the plot and make a synthesis. However, one of the main character of the book is agent Orlov, a Soviet agent who managed at the end of WWI  to be infiltrated in the Nazis and then in the American forces without being discovered until his death decades later in the Washington area. Other episodes are revealed that would make the interested reader in spy stories very into the action. However, two weak spots of the book are: Trento does not provide other reliable sources than hearsays from his own sources, therefore no proof is underpinning the stories. Secondly, the book does not reveal any important facts that would make it really revealing or astonishing, like would have been if he had mentioned something related to the now well known stay-behind operation in Europe. But if you are able to maintain your \\"suspension of belief\\" and navigate between the thin line that separates non-fiction from quasi-fiction stories Trento's book is readable and interesting.	2005-07-15

Since children's learning ability can be hindered by many factors, the author suggests to find out what is the problem and develop a strategy to circumvent it. Easier said than done. The cases presented in the book do not cover all situations but can be helpful to clarify the issue and to understand better the mechanisms at work. For that the book deserves credit. As an aside, this book and A Mind at a Time by the same author have some policy implications that could and should be developed more thoroughly by dr. Levine. There is policy-maker material here.	2005-07-13

Ancient thinkers were lost in the West after the fall of the Roman Empire. Reason became subjugated to faith and religion must supersede the reason. The secular humanist tradition of defiance dates back to ancient Greek mythology. The best example is Prometheus, idolized by ancient Greeks as the one who defied Zeus. He stole the fire of the gods and brought it down to earth. For this reason he was eternally punished. The continuous challenge to authority was viewed as a value. At the turn of the first millennium this body of knowledge was lost in the West, but it survived in those lands under Islamic rule. However, the story begins in the tenth century when Christians launched the Reconquest of Spain from the Muslims. This lengthy process will last until Grenada is liberated in 1492. However, the main centers are already under Christian control by the XII century and old works of Greek philosophy will be retranslated back into Latin. In Plato's Euthyphro, Socrates asks if something is good because God ordains it, or if God ordains it because it is already good. Since the time of the ancient Greeks, no mainstream religion (apart from Islam at its beginnings) has permitted such questioning of God's will or made a hero out of a dissident like Prometheus. The awakening of the western mind has begun and the divorce of faith and reason is going to be consumed in the West. Simple but captivating. Recommended.	2005-07-13

It is clear and well written and can be also entertaining. It applies to children with or without learning disabilities. The main thesis is that for better or worse, everybody is afflicted by a learning disability, even if that can be minor and didn't give rise to any problem at school. Defects can be unnoticeable and go undetected. Sometimes those problems lies in unexpected places. We can develop, consciously or unconsciously, strategies to come around those little difficulties. However, the book does not provide practical guidance to detect those difficulties or to cope with them. It provides an useful background but not a roadmap. Sometime the author comes up with commonsensical advise. However, it is a very good starting point.	2005-07-13

The author seems to prefer some scientists instead of others and gives more details for those that he probably likes the most and overlooks others. So the coverage is not equal. Having said that, he puts the scientific discoveries in context and makes the all story an interesting discovery in itself. The main thesis is that discoveries are not accidental and the scientist does not live in a vaccum but instead it is a slow process that builds on previous scientists and discoveries. What is not about: it's not a history of medicine, nor a history of machines. Physics (and a little bit of chemistry) and biology seem to be his main subjects (physics definetively more than biology). He keeps the subject very simple and sometimes for the sake of simplicity he omits some details about the scientific discovery itself for which explanations are not provided: for instance, the general theory of relativity or the Kepler's 3 laws are left for further readings.  All in all, it is a beautiful book that I sincerely recommend to the reader.  <br />	2005-07-11

It is a fascinating discourse on human behaviour and how little details can have a big impact, tipping the scale. God is in the detail. Several cases are presented in a catching way. Two cases presented by Gladwell are worth the price of the book and the time spent reading it: chapter 3 on the stickiness factor, comparing, inter alia, Sesame Street and Blue's Clues; and chapter 4 on the power of context, which deals with the rise and fall of crime in New York and the popular Giuliani's zero tolerance policy.

This original book deserves attention and I would recommend it to economists other than political scientists. The author is a professor of law at Yale, but her background does not come up in the book. That is good for the general reader. The first lines begin with a dramatic personal experience, an homicide, in her family back in the Philippines, a wealthy Chinese family in a destitute social environment. After that the book develops the idea that market dominant minorities in several countries, with no continental exception, with the support of an undemocratic political system in many cases, have generated resentments in the majority of the population, who have in turn developed a strong, even violent, distaste for market economy, globalization (whatever is the content in that label) and ethnic backlash. Amy Chua comes to the conclusion that democracy can be inimical to the interests of market dominant minorities. However, democracy means different things to different peoples, as she correctly points it out. Market dominant minorities see democracy as a means for protecting themselves from the tyranny of the oppressed majority and the conservation of the status quo. Oppressed majorities see democracy as a means for redistribution of wealth and equal opportunities, even as a springboard for human development. In the social and ethnic contexts described by Chua, rapid democratization can lead to unwanted results. To prove her thesis, prof. Chua gives many examples taken from around the world. In certain cases, her examples are overstretched, especially when it tackles the US and other countries. In others, the book becomes repetitive. But the bottom line seems to be correct, and deserve a closer look. The book does not contain a general theory that is applicable to all cases. However, prof. Chua applies it too generously even when that is only a minor blip in a more complex situation. All in all, it is a great book.	2005-07-07

Highly recommended to everybody. The book is an attempt to provide an account of the evolution of human rights over time and through political and philosophical thought. The author is well versed in political science and shows it off in this book while surfing in a very wide literature. It is well written.

Jared Diamond's focus is on the last 13 thousand years or so, from the last Ice age up to now.  His aim is to compress so much in a readable book, distilling the main driving forces in human history. According to Diamond's thesis (and others before him) if you re-run the movie of the last 13000 years over and over, you would end up most of the times with similar dynamics (of course, chaos theories would anticipate some twists every time you run such improbable experiments). The main driving forces in human history in such large time span are: the diverse potential availability of wild crops and animals apt to domestication in the five continents gave a head start to peoples living in privileged \\"real estates\\"; the orientation of continental axis (North-South vs. East-West) and the presence of physical barriers within continents accelerated or hindered the diffusion and transfer of knowledge, culture and ideas; the population size and the related competition for space and resources promoted better organizations (the hydraulic theory of states) and creative ways for survival and expansion (a sort of \\"grow or die\\" theory). The book is successful in introducing (or making popular) crop and soil science in world history. Definitively a must read, before approaching the more technical \\"The History and Geography of Human Genes\\" by Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza. Of course, other factors played a relevant role in history, and those factors have changed over the arc of time of your study. For instance, in the last 3000 years, in the West, Greco-Roman civilization has played her big role as much as Chinese unification in the Far East. If one focuses on the last 5 or 6 centuries, religion and state fragmentation in Europe and Middle East can explain many developments. Ivanhoe in the West and the Tale of Genji in Japan as far as literature is concerned can have an explanatory power, too. And so on. However, the driving forces that gave a head start to certain areas of the globe are well described in Guns, Germs, and Steel (a misleading title, by the way). If a weak spot this comment should highlight is the book's stinginess with tables and maps. <br /> <br />	2005-07-06

It is a bit disappointing that an audio book that is sold as a combination of music and classic literature for children has not music at all.<br />well it has some music, a short intro at the beginning of each story. that's it. No sounds, no effects, no music...only the voice of the narrator. The narrator is very good, and the stories from Cinderella to Little Red Riding Hood are interesting and attractive for children. But the simple voice of the narrator is not enough to keep children between 3 and 4 interested in stories longer than 10 minutes (all but few are longer than 10 min.). Perfect would be 5 minutes for that age range (3 or 4).<br />Another drawback is the fact that the CDs do not go with a book, so you need to buy a book for each story with pictures suitable for children of 3 or 4.

However, few pages can be eliminated giving to the reading a better rithm.  The title  says what this book is about: The history of the weaks, whether or not they eventually emancipate themselves. Definetively it's a book that I would recommend to read, but not before a comprehensive US history book. In fact, the author explicitly focuses on a part of US history. However, I gave a four stars because the last chapters (from 18 on, that is, from Vietnam on) are too rushy and overlook some facts that would strenghten the author's point. In fact, the author has a view that is not hidden since page 1.  All in all, the merit of this book is that collects in one book material scattered over too many sources. The defect is in what he has left out: the winners' reasons. But they are well known anyway.	2002-12-15

I needed a book on whitecollar crime in US and I had to search intensively. For one reason or another the books on the market and in law libraries are for US lawyers which means that you don't find a full treatise on the subject but starting points that you have to develop by yourself. This book is the best I could find in an atrophic market. So if you are a novice don't expect very much but a short introduction on theoretical concept. One question I had in mind was how harsh was the punishment for such crimes and how precise and effective was the contour of the crime. Well, the answer is not here. If I had to rely on this book for an anwer I can infer that there is some punishment in theory for a vague crime. Unless you know well and by heart the US Sentencing guidelines and the rest of the US crime law, you end up with more questions than answers. It's more on the elements of the crime (willfulness, mens rea, a scheme to defraud etc.) than on the actual behavior the laws are meant to cope with. So read this book and be ready to do your own research.	2002-09-17
