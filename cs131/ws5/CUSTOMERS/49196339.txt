The Seeing Stone is on my top ten list of favorite books. <BR>       I was looking very forward to this sequel. Here's what was wrong with it:<BR>*I missed Oliver, Sir John, Serle, and all of the other characters at Caldicot. In this book, Arthur is at Holt, where he is training to become a knight with Lord Stephen. While some of the characters at Holt were interesting, they weren't as much fun as those at Holt. And the \\"bad\\" characters and what they did didn't matter in the long wrong (their villiany wasn't too interesting, either.)<BR>*Where is Merlin?! <BR>*In the last book, I almost wished there had been more of Arthur-in-the-Stone. But this book is FILLED with Arthurian legand. Don't get me wrong-I love stories about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. But there were so many stories about knights who either weren't too interesting, weren't developed into the story enough,or didn't have enough details. Plus, most of the legends didn't reflect in Arthur de Caldicot's life, as they are supposed to.<BR>    I'm not saying that you shouldn't read this book. But maybe you should borrow it from the library. Just know that whenever I read Seeing Stone (and I've read it more than once) I always wish that it would never end. But I couldn't wait for this book to be over!	2003-03-17

Like the Princess Diaries, Sloppy Firsts is written like a diary. Like Speak, Jessica Darling is NOT having a happy life. However, The Princess Diaries and Speak are muche better books. Everyone in this book has parts when I couldn't stand them. And Jessica has bad thoughts about everything. This book wasn't very funny, but I couldn't stop reading, and I had to know what was going to happen. However, this book is really deppressing, and there are better books out there.	2003-01-01
US	49196339	R3B5ZZR0ETXRSG	0152164928	165886198	Troy	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A great retelling of the Trojan War!	I love Greek Mythology, and I'm glad I read this book. The main characters are Xanthe, who cares for Hector's son, and Xanthe's sister, Marpessa, who is a servant of Helen of Troy's. Because everyone is paying attention to Hades and not to her, the goddess Aphodite decided to make things more interesting, and has Xanthe and Marpessa both fall in love with Alastor, who is wounded in the war. There are other characters who play important roles as well, like Iason, who cares for the horses in Hector's stables, and Phrontis, Alastor's horrible mother. <BR>   I liked how Gods kept coming and warning characters about what was about to happen, but no one believed who they said they were and thought they were crazy. <BR>    This book was pretty violent, but it was really good anway.	2002-12-26

It tells the story of a young girl named Anaxandra, taken as a hostage to the island of Siphnos where she is a companion to the Princess Callisto. When war comes, she must pertend to be Callisto in order to save herself. Before the books is over, she has to pretend to be even more people. The villain is Helen of Troy, who I hated ( I mean that in a good way), but one of my favorite charaters was Paris, who was equally as mean as Helen. And the main character, Anaxandra, was so real. <BR>    Goddess of Yesterday was easy to undersaynd, good Historical fiction, detailed Greek Mythology, and very exciting. I couldn't put the book down, and I wish it had gone on longer. And, unlike a lot of Caroline B. Cooney's other books, the ending to Goddess of Yesterday was complete.	2002-08-21

Her father is a surgeon and she gets to help him cure people. In her spare time, she enjoys spitting and throwing things. But things change when her father's apprentice, William, tells Jane that she should be a lady. Because she had a crush on him, she enrolls in a girl's school. Within a few years she is a lady. Willaim goes west to the fronteir, and sends a letter asking Jane to marry her. To her father's dismay, she goes. You have to read the book to find out what happens next. This is a fantastic book! I felt so sorry for Jane at certain parts of the book. And, this book is way better than Our Only May Amelia, the other book by the author.	2002-07-26
US	49196339	R3PQYJSJ9FIXUP	0439083877	750028032	Top Ten Shakespeare Stories	Books	4	4	4	N	N	I learned a lot about Shakespeare	Not only does this book count down the top ten Shakespeare stories, but between each chapter there are the top ten lists like \\" Top Ten Shakepearian Actors\\" . My favorite one was a list of all the people that might have written the plays instead of Shakespeare. You should know that the book doesn't have the real plays, just the summeries and facts. The only problem I had was that there wasn't much detail- Like in Hamlet, it was just one of the characters saying how everyone died, and not a lot of detil of what else happened. But it was still a good book, and you'll really like it if you read Horrible histories.	2002-07-10

I wasn't dissappointed with the Coffin Quilt. My favorite characters were Fanny, Rosanna, and Alifair (I hated her so much!)<BR>    It was interesting when Ro ran off with Johnse hatfeild, but I wish that we got to actually hear what they were saying, instead of what only Fanny thought.<BR>    Towards the end it got really good. I felt so sorry for everyone in this book! Especially Fanny: Everyone she knew was going crazy...	2002-06-29

And I didn't like Holly, the main LEPrecon character. However, Artemis Fowl, the 12 year old criminal mastermind, is one of my favorite characters in all the books I've read. The problem is, is that he's only in about one tenth of the book. And he's the best part.	2002-06-26

We went WAy into detail. Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is about the Logan family.  In the story, we learn of how they came into owing their 400 acres of land, and the problems that come with it. The narrator is nine year old Cassie, who dosen't understand why her black family isn't treated as well as her white neighbors.	2002-06-26

Ella is a girl who had a gift given to her as a baby. The fairy Lucinda thought it would be a good idea to make Ella obediant. That was a mistake. Now, Ella must do whatever someone tells her. <BR>      The fanatsy is this book is GREAT!!!!

Homeless Bird had a lot of detail about life in India for different genders, and what people did each day as part of their life. The only part I didn't like was Sass. She was so mean! Anyway, I do reccomend this book. It's easy, and a good read.	2002-05-05

She kind of has a problem. She dosen't actually like this guy. Instead, she still has a HUGE crush on her best friend Lilly's older brother Michael.<BR>     The reason I didn't like this book as much as the others is that the story is kind of old by now. There isn't a huge plot in this book, but a lot does happen. My favorite part is the hilarious list of instructions Mia leaves for her family on how they have to take car of her cat.	2002-05-05

I have read almost all of the Dear America books, and this is my favorite. There is so much detail about what life was like for slaves-for those who worked out in the hot feilds, and for those who worked in the kitchens, under the watchful eyes of the plantation owner. I have never really liked the topic of the Civil War and slavery, but I loved this book. There are many exciting scenes. Everyone should read it.	2002-04-03

I'm not giving this 4 stars because I didn't like parts of it, it just wasn't the same as my favorite DA books. But it was worth reading. I learned how awful it was for the women on the picket lines, and how even worse it was for the women in jail. Another reason I didn't like this that much was because I'm not interested in the time period, but people who are will enjoy this book very much.	2002-03-30

I'm thirteen, and my mom and I like it. <BR>   This book is a mystery about 11 animals who gather for Horace the elephant's birthday. They spend time playing games, and when they come back inside, the food is missing! The reader has to find out who took the food. There are a ton of clues on every page, ranging from all of those clocks, to nametags, to what's going on in the background. There are also many codes. We figured out the morse code page. Some other ones were written in heiroglyphics. <BR>   I highly reccomend this book to everybody!!!!!	2002-03-02

But I am very glad I read it. This book was written differently than other books I've read, and had very good details. I couldn't wait for Arthur to use the Seeing Stone again, because i had to find out what would happen to Ygerna. <BR>   I think everyone will like this book.

It wasn't bad, but if you aren't a big fan of science fiction you probably won't like it as much. <BR>   The first few chapters are good, and so are the last. I didn't understand half of what the characters were talking about, though. And SO MUCH of it was sci fi, I couldn't read large amounts of it at once. <BR>   But this book does have some GREAT things about it. The deamons are great! So is the concept that they can't be very far away from you, and that they change shape until they get to be a certain age. One of the charcters in the series' deamon stayed a dolphin, so he must always be on a boat or near his daemon. <BR>   The Golden Compass was cool, too. <BR>There were a lot of parts I didn't like. A lot of things are mixed in together, and at least I didn't understand them. First of all, Lyra's uncle is fighting some religous war. He's also searching for this mysterious thing called \\" dust\\", which humans have never heard of. Then there's the Texan aeronaut. Plus, there's those witches, one of whom has a goose for a daemon. At the end there's a place with all of those kids, who are having their daemons tkaen away, which I still don't get. And the whole thing ties in with the Northern lights. Most of it takes place in the snow, but some of it takes place at Oxford and Jordan colleges. Then there's those talking bears. And then those Angels. Plus ther'e the bad guy ( girl) who isn't very nice. I read this book when I was eleven, but I can't wait to read it again. I think if they did a good job, a movie would be cool.<BR>   So I do reccomend this book. Older people might like it more.<BR>Truthfully, I loved and hated this book.	2002-02-21

There is an ensemble of characters, ranging from Judge JJ Ford, the first female and first black Supreme Court Justice in the state; Turtle Wexler, the 13 year old who discovered Sam Westing's dead body;to Crow, the religous cleaning women who always wears black.

Everyone is tied together, we find out, when vaulubles start disappearing and bombs start going off.	2002-02-12

There were a few very funny lines in this book, and that's why I gave it three stars. But the rest of the book was totally unreal. My friends and I are around 14, and we don't make out with people. We don't even go out with people! That's what the characters in this book do.	2002-02-11

I haven't seen the movie, but I wanted to read the book. The first 180 pages are introduction. The next ten pages are the climax and ending. And the ending wasn't that great anyway. There were no clues leading up to the why certain things happen at the climax, and the things that do happen are two pags before the climax. Pls, I wish this book was more historical fictiony. If I didn't know it took place in the 50s, I would have guessd it took place now. I don't really reccomend this. My friends said it was really sad and cute, but it wasn't at all. Read OUT OF TIME by Caroline B. Cooney.	2002-02-06

This book is about a rich girl named Amanda. Her servant is Miranda, and the two of them happen to look exactly alike.<BR> So alike, that all of Amanda's boyfriends get confused, and that leads to trouble. To make it even more confusing, it takes place on the Titanic. The bad part was that some of it was too confusing just to read once- I had to read some parts over and over.	2002-01-31

Mary, Bloody Mary was better though, and I thought that book was better because Mary is known as being not so good, so in that book it was interesting to read about her as a kid. Beware, Princess Elizabeth didn't have one big event, but many little ones. I still reccomend it, because there were things that I did learn from this book.	2002-01-27

It was about a boy who goes to find his father after his mother and sister die. If you ask me, it was too easy for him to find his father, and Clem's father was too succesful in the end. I don't reccomend it.	2002-01-27

It was so exciting and I couldn'ty wait to find out what would happen to Jane. This story is totally worth reading and very exciting. I also learned what life was like in Boston in the 1800s. 9 out of 10!	2002-01-27

But really, nothing exciting happened. My favorite part was probably when the boys are telling the secrets that they know. Also, why does the principal believe that Marc always has something to do with a fight when he was the one being beat up? Better for younger readers.	2002-01-27

It was interesting learning about how Paul Revere's family was treated, and how he did his job as a silversmith. One of the best parts was when Sarah and her brother go to help their father warn everyone that the British are coming. I wish the information on using dental records to identify people was mentioned more. Not my favorite, but you might like it...	2002-01-27

Widow Chase was almost too nice to them, and she let them live in her house. And the girl's little brother hardly got into any trouble, and was hardly ever a problem. Better for younger readers.	2002-01-27

I learned about the different patterns used in pottery, the ways of molding clasy, and how special each piece of artwork was to its artist.<BR> I didn't mind that this book won the Newbery Medal of 2002, but there were better books out this year that I liked more.	2002-01-22

The new orphan's guardians are the Squalors, who are obessed with waht is In and Out. I love they way they are decorating the lobby of their apartment on Dark Lane. Although this already happened in The Austere Acadamy, One of the characters in this book does reappear in the others. The next books wouldn't have been as interesting without her!<BR>   I also liked the part at the auction when the orphans are trying to bid for VFD, and the other things that happen at this part of the book.	2002-01-20

I read this book in two days. It definitally wasn't as good as the first book, but still worth reading. It was really interesting, but the subject wasn't new because it had been introduced in PRINCESS DIARIES. I can't wait for PRINCESS IN LOVE.	2002-01-15

This book has more to do with King Arthur and his court, and was a lot more exciting if you ask me. You find out more about Arthurian legend.	2002-01-03

I usually race through books I love, but this one was SO GOOD that I read it as slowly as possible so it wouldn't end. It was amazing!!!!! This is definatly the best book of 2001. ( I  read over 30 books from 2001 because I am a newberry reader). I reccomend this to everyone, though girls may enjoy it more. THE BEST BOOK OF 2001!!!!!	2002-01-03

This is one of the best Dear America books I have read. The story is thick with details and gives you a big imprtession of how life was in the Deppression. The characters are good, and the details are even better. Plus, the ending couldn't have been written better!	2001-10-24

While this book wasn't the funniest in the series, it wasEdefinately one of the best. Lemony Snicket starts to play a HUGE role in this book, as do the rest of the charcters and gaurdians. There were some anagrams, but not enough. I hope anagrams will play a big role with the rest of the books, too. <BR>   If you are just starting this series, start at the begining. While the first book is one of my least favorite, they get better as you go along.	2001-09-27

I think its fine that some people don't want their kids reading this book, but I think its awful that they are trying to tell EVERYONE not to read it. Have they ever heard of free speech?!?! I have also noticed that some people think these books are two gory (The unicorn scene). Well, some good books are kind of gross. I don't mind. I love certain fantasy books and I love the fact that a lot of them have to do with wizardry. I even had a home-made Harry costume before the store bought costumes came out!

Yes, I like the fact that the author defines words on every page. I think its funny. I also like his examples of the words, and how he sometimes leaves the story to talk about something else. While the plots aren't alway my favorite, I like the way Lemony Snicket writes. The Bad Begining isn't my favorite in the series, and I think they get better as they go along. I love the 2nd and 3rd and especially the 6th.	2001-09-19

Instead, I was disappointed. There was not enough dialoge to keep it interesting, and the beggining went way to slow. The door was too sudden, and it's not clear why the door is even in Hendricks School for Boys. I still think there should have been more info about Jason and Nina.( Why were they doing that anyway???) And Mr. Hendricks showed up way too suddenly, without much information. Even though I did not like this book, I still reccomend Among the Hidden. That book was much better. I definately do NOT reccomend Just Ella. That book was horrible.	2001-07-08

I liked it(I finished it this morning), but it was very different compared to the other Harry Potter books.There were many more characters, and of explainations about things that happened before. It was a lot darker, and I will miss the character  who died. I gave it 4 stars because it was harder to understand.	2000-07-09
