It was so hard to read. I mean- I don't want to give it away- and I think that the story is a powerful one of willpower and addiction. But to me, that story gets very lost in the format. The book is highly dialog. Yet there is no puncuation to set apart the different characters.  In this book, unfortunately, I found that the author's liberties with style severely detracted from the actual story the book was trying to tell. It made the book terribly hard for me to finish because as I returned to the book after setting it down- I would have to re-read several pages to remember who was talking and what was being talked about. I felt that the style drowned out the different voices of the characters. It saddened me because I felt it made the book a chore to read- and I feel that it may turn readers off.<br /><br />That being said...some of the characters in this book really shone through for me. Specifically Leonard and Miles. I felt that despite the disruptive style of prose- these characters were vividedly painted and true characters.  And I feel that underneth trying to figure out who was speaking - there is a powerful story of the almost constant stuggle over addictions.  Overall though I was disappointed with this book.  I am giving it three stars for the story and characters- it would have been higher if it hadn't been for the hard-to-read format of the story.	2005-10-01

I really loved this book...it was given to me as a gift...and that is what it truly was- a gift.  When I first started reading the book - it felt a little choppy- until I realized that the book is not in novel format- as I expected but in several short vignettes all relating her experiences in the Fishing Village somewhere on the Alaskan Tundra.  In this manner I find the book to be much like Steinbeck's The Long Valley- which I loved...except that her stories aren't fictional.<br /><br />The stories of a \\"city girl's experience working in an Alaskan fishing village\\" (from the front cover) are both humorous and adventurous often at the same time. The author's ability to give me a picture of the fishing village in my head, the descriptive nature of the text is what first pulled me in...and then...there are the stories of the people and work in the fishing village...I felt like I was there while reading this book.  My favorite story? Well it was hard to pick...but I would probably say the one about the brown bears! I don't want to spoil much of this gem- because the only think I found at fault with the book was that it was far too short. I will be looking for more from Danielle Henderson- that is for certain!	2005-03-28

I have always been an SE HINTON fan...and have read all of her books.<br /><br />I came into Hawkes Harbor with an open mind- and was pleasantly surprised.  The book is the story of Jamie Sommers, an orphan who was conceived in adultery. The nuns at the orphanage were brutal and mean to Jamie and told him constantly that he would end up no good-- and they were right. Jamie became something of a pirate, smuggler, and arms dealer- fulfilling the prophesy the nuns bestowed upon him. But Jamie viewed his rough life on the high seas the adventure of a lifetime- surviving shark attacks, foreign prison terms, among other things.  It wouldn't be until Jamie settled down in a small Delaware town called Hawkes Harbor that Jamie would find something evil enough to break his wild spirit, eventually driving him insane.<br /><br />The story is a gripping one. A story that I thoroughly enjoyed despite the disjointed style in which it is written, which I noticed many other reviews found a fault with. I believe that the disjointed style the author used showed readers just how badly Jamie had been broken by the ultimate evil that he ran into, an evil named Grenville Hawkes.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book that is is too short and some areas could have been expounded upon.  Like Jamie's life before he was orphaned- demonstrating the life he had  before he was brought to live with the nuns.  Other than that I give this book four stars- for an excellent story that moves well and is gripping in both suspense and timeline.	2004-12-20

I recently joined a book club and this was the first book we decided on reading.  It was a book that I have been wanting to read anyway so I picked up a copy. Some people in our club found the book hard to read because of the odd number of chapters and tons of mathematical references.  I will be the first to admit that some of this stuff did throw me for a loop. It is almost like walking around with two left shoes on...But that must be what it is to be autistic.<br /><br />I have never read a book that detailed the inner workings and points of view of someone who is autistic.  The contanstant fear of being touched. Being confused by lies because lies aren't truth.  Christopher identifies mostly with Math and animals...because they are almost always the same.  They are governed by rules not emotions. Rules are easy for him to understand.<br /><br />This is an excellent book overall and I highly recommend reading it- for the experience of being in Christopher's mind if not for the literary accomplishment that Mark Haddon has made writing a book through the eyes of an autisic teenage boy.	2004-12-02

This book has got to be one of the most awesome books I have read in a long long time.  I bought it on a whim, after reading what it was about.  I have yet to be so pleased with the purchase of a book as I have been about this one.<br /><br />It is the story of Patty Taylor, single mother to two-year old Willie.  She is a musician struggling on the road to make it bit and to give Willie the life he deserves. She is use to struggle though- coming from an alcoholic mother, homelessness, and working graveyard shifts as a dishwasher for a diner.<br /><br />On the road, life is tough, never living in anyone place very long.  She feels that the band sees her as a meal ticket not as a human and definitely not as a serious singer.  Enter Willie's father, on parole from prison for dealing drugs.  Rick wants nothing more than to have Patty and Willie in her life.  He pleades with Patty to take him back, that prison changed him for the better.<br /><br />Thus begins Patty's epic journey that will transform her from a girl who can just about take anything life throws at her (or so she thinks) to a woman who can shout down the moon.<br /><br />Tucker creates a very real character in Patty Taylor. There is depth to Patty and even flaws- like in each of us.  Patty Taylor is one of the most real characters I have read in a long long time.  She may be a heroine but she is more real than most heroes and heroines that you will read about it.  All supporting characters are very true to themselves and the story throughout the novel. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />I am now going to go purchase her other book.	2004-09-01

The cover intrigued me and the discription of the book on the back intrigued me even more.  Unfortunately I feel that to book didn't have follow through.<br /><br />I found all four voices in this book to be too similar. There was no tangable differences between Cheryl and Jason especially.  I also found Reg and and Heather's sections to be extremely forced.<br /><br />This book is timely and I think it had GREAT potential.  However I feel it falls flat. The characters are trite and extremely naive to the world.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars.	2004-08-31

I am an avid Kay Hooper fan- because she is always able to keep me guessing until the very end...and she didn't disappoint me this time.<br /><br />In this book, Lucas Jordan of the Special Crimes Unit is called in to deal with a serial kidnapper, who puts his victims in hazardous contraptions that will kill them eventually if they are not found in time...and so far- no one has gotten out alive.<br /><br />In true Hooper style this book is fast paced, and intriguing.  And as always there is a paranormal thread that ties the story together.  The serial kidnapper is playing a game of life and death with Jordan, and so far the kidnapper is winning.  Lucas Jordan of the SCU is experiencing a paranormal block that is only allowing him reach the kidnapped victims to late.  The only question is can Luke overcome the block before someone else is killed.<br /><br />Hooper incorporates the paranormal, romance, and lots of suspense, that kept me turning the pages! Her characters are not run of the mill heros, but real people with real problems and issues- which makes them interesting.<br /><br />It is going to be a long wait until Summer 2005 when the next book is scheduled to come out.	2004-08-31

One sister, Rose is a successful attorney at a high powered law firm, in a relationship with one of the partners in the firm.  By all outward appearances she is perfect and happy.  Then there is Maggie Mae, the younger sister of Rose, who has a body to kill for and a screwed up life.  She wants be famous, but has done little more than have her hip appear behind Will Smith in a video.  Maggie Mae has a knack for fashion, stealing and snooping into lives of others.<br />After moving in with Rose, Maggie seduces Rose's legal partner boyfriend and is, of course caught in the act by none other than Rose. Rose promptly throws both of them out of her life.<br />I won't give anymore of the plot away, but I will say that Maggie ends up vowing to make her life better and runs off to Princeton and then to Florida, where she finds her niche in life.<br />The book is quick to read and almost as witty as Good in Bed.  The one major problem I found in this book is the author's attempt to tie up GOOD IN BED by adding (forcing) in Rose's meeting with Cannie from Good In Bed.  In my opinion it was all very forced and distracting.  Other than that an excellent book.	2004-07-14

An urge to write a story told to her nightly by her mother, leads to her quest to find out more about her late mother, who died in a hotel fire, registered under a different name.  Under the pretenses of writing her mother's memiors and looking for her mother's lost manuscript, Iris becomes manager at the hotel she lived in as a child.  She finds love in an unlikely place, as well as a renewed love for the hotel she grew up in as her parents worked in the hotel.<br />The writing in this book is beautiful.  The imagery in both the fairy tale and the rest of the novel, jumps out of the book and paints a picture of the time and the place.  The author's characters are real people- not &quot;fairy-tale&quot; people who live perfect lives.  Every time I had to put the book down, I could not wait to be able to pick it back up again to finish it.  It was a very satisfying story- and I will be sure to check out Goodman's first book- and her new book.	2004-07-01

I love the three distinct voices in the book in addition to the occasional narrator...<br />Jodine is an anal control freak, Emma is a uninhibited free spirit and Allie is teetering the delicate line between being a teenage and an adult.  The three unlikely girls become roommates but not friends...not necessarily.  The bond a bit after an accidental kitchen fire causes $10,000 worth of damage that they need to repair themselves or suffer the wrath of Carl the absent landlord.<br />After the kitchen fire- the story becomes a little predictable but none the less entertaining as they struggle to make money to pay for the repairs.  In the process one roommate falls for the other roommate's crush, one roommate acts out a fantasy with a bartender and ruins a relationship she didn't know she had, one roommate finds real love.  But will their relationship as friends survive?  That you will have to read to find out.	2004-05-24

I will be the first to admit that I bought this book because it was touted as &quot;THE MUST READ Hollywood TELL-ALL.&quot; Then I started reading it...and at first I decided that this book was probably not going to be one I finished because it was just about Joe and the not-so-nice (animal) man that he is in Hollywood...But then I started to get wrapped up into his childhood, being an young immigrant in the USA and his experiences growing up and an immigrant and a child whose mother suffered from mental illness.<br /><br />This book is telling, but so much more than that - it is an honest view of a life lived hard and fast, in the not-so-honest world of Hollywood.  You will get more information about Hollywood than you ever wanted to know...and throughout this book you will see Joe Eszterhas not as a &quot;Hollywood person&quot; or a writer but as a person- a person who readily admits he made mistakes in his professional and personal life...but a man who stuck up not only for himself but for the written word and his creative process.<br />This book was so much more than I bargained for but I loved it all the same.	2004-05-17

I really did want to like this book, however, I ended up struggling to get through it.  First of all, I felt that this book fell far short of the message it was trying to send. I think it was trying to send the message that it is who you are in the inside more than the outside.<br /><br />What I got out of this book instead that if you are overweight, you are clinically depressed and feel that you have no value to society.  Main character Diana is depressed and depressing.  She is overweight, she hates her job situation, she hates her mother, she has deep emotional issues that have nothing to do with being overweight, and her only friend is the 98 year old lady who lives next door to her.  But if she gets skinny- it will all go away.<br /><br />That is what we are fed to believe by society and this book perpetuates the very myth it is trying so hard to dispell.  This book is excruciatingly stereotypical by creating characters who fall into the usual \\"I am fat so that must be the reason for all the ills in my life\\" the author is giving her character a very flat personality and thus the character of Diana is not a real or believable character.  I was extremely disappointed with this book.	2004-04-09

She convienently falls into a dream job working as the assistant to a fallen-from-graces famous photographer because she has taken a couple of photography classes at a local community college.<br />The problem with this book is that everything seems to fall too neatly into place in Kelly McGraw's new life.  Dream job, dream boyfriend who wants her but she doesn't even know is there at first...it is far too predictable for my tastes...but as another reviewer said...it comes with a pretty pink cover.	2004-04-09

It is an intense book that realistically protrays how such a tragedy effects not only an entire family...but the community at large.<br />I was skepitcal when I first picked up this book, because, in my mind it had the possibility of being very hokey and unrealistic in its protrayal of the victim and her family...however I was delightfully proved wrong.<br />What I found most intersting, though, was parallels that exist between this novel (a work of fiction) and the author's memior called LUCKY, in which she chronicals the life-changing event of being raped on her college campus.  Especially interesting are the methods of rape and the location of the rape of Alice Sebold in comparison to the rape and murder of the main character of this book, Susie Salmon.<br />I highly suggest reading both books and comparing them...it is interesting to see how real life effects a work of art.	2004-02-26

She feels an inexplicable need (perhaps driven by guilt) to photograph the comatose girl and ends up falling into tumuluous relationships with three men involved in the accident: The boyfriend of the comatose girl, the premed who struck the girls and one of the officers at the scene of the crime...all of whom she has sex with at some point or another.  Suddenly finding herself pregnant she marries Cootie, the boyfriend.  Then finds herself in a loveless, violent marriage. It is at this point that the book falls apart slightly, as Kissy jumps from a marriage with Cootie to a marriage with Mike, the officer...even though the father of her child is probably the premed student.

I have read some of Nicholas Spark's other books...and could classify them only as mushy tear jerkers...which this book is NOT.  It is a love story yes...but it is also suspenseful and mysterious.  I felt it was perfectly paced...I didn't feel that anything was too rushed.  I like the writing style- simple but not so simple it's stupid.  The story line drew me in and made me feel like I was watching it...I think that this would make a great movie.	2003-05-19

I have read the entire series to date and greatly anticipate the release of each one...however I was disappointed with P.  Because of that I was leary of Q...and wonderfully surprised.  I felt that Q brought back the pace that I felt was missing in P.  If you felt P was missing something...Q is better...trust me.	2003-05-16

I found myself identifying with the main character and it was fun to watch her dive back into the dating scene...and meet some interesting and not-so interesting guys...  great for a quick entertaining read.	2003-05-16

The story is great too.  It is a wonderful version of Cinderella that I think most children will love.	2003-05-16

Most convincing to me is his art as well as the fact that she is able to make me see how THE RIPPER doesn't necessarily need to be a surgeon as one theory suggests.  I believe Patricia is on the right track and look forward to hearing more when she is able to get more of the test results back.	2003-05-16

Her owners didn't seem to care about her in the way you would think from the description.  Perth had a poor life at the fault of the owners...moving her around and around.  The writing style trys too hard, as if he looked up a word in the thesaurus every other word.  A bad book, a bad dog owner...a sad dog.	2003-04-11

The premise of this book is a good one, don't get me wrong there.  It had possibilities.  Unfortunately, it fell flat far from these.  It didn't promise all seemed.  Basically it tells you why you should be afraid of certain things...but there is no new information, nothing exciting, and the things to be afraid of, frankly, are stupid.  It is boring in its presentation.  It was that book that could've but didn't.	2003-04-11

This book is excruciatingly predictable and rather flatly written.  Her main characters bored me.  I have never in my life taken so long to finish such a short book, but I had to force myself to read it.  I hope that not all of her books are this flat and I will try another one...but I think this one is a stinker.	2003-01-06

I reccomend that you read this book before you read her book LOVELY BONES as it gives incredible insight into the backgroud of her fiction.	2002-10-11

This book is decidedly less graphic than touching evil but that does not distract from the book at all.  It is still a fast paced read with twists and turns that Kay Hooper is famous for.  I definitely recommend this book and can't wait for her next book!!!!	2002-07-09

Whether your a King fan or just a writer, you will gain valuable knowlege from this book.  It not only looks at the craft of writing, but the experiences behind the craft.  It shows your how everyday experience can become extraordinary novels.  Definitely a must have.	2002-03-22

While it does provide an interesting look at Las Vegas, most of it is Entertainment related.  Specifically: movies filled there, musicians who have played there, showgirls and celebrities who live and work there.	2002-03-21

The character developement of this girl is thorough.  The way the author describes the tics and the other indications of Tourette's are very believable and well done.  Overall I think that this book is definitely worth the investment.	2002-03-21

It is very informative and packed with information that history buffs will love.  It also explains the evolution of Las Vegas from a western town teetering on the edge of becoming a ghost town to the boom that started with the building of the Hoover (Boulder) Dam and continues today.  This book is very academic in nature, so you have to love history to like this book.  Overall a very interesting book.	2002-03-12

Look for the reference, shakespeare buffs and I am sure that you will find it. I really think that this books opens up a non-western tale in a traditional way that children will understand.	2002-02-23

I liked how the chapters were written by a different member of the band and alternated.<br />The chapters were very articulate and well worded as were they well thought out. A great book.<br />My only pet peeve is I felt that it was just kind of left open ended. But I guess that IS life.	2002-02-23

I found it to be more of a &quot;who I did, when&quot; type of book than a biography.  I especially found the first couple of chapters tedious to get through.  I guess she was trying to lay down where she came from but that is not what I got at all.	2002-02-23

I found it immensely entertaining as well as informative. There are helpful chapters on how to get a free room in Vegas, Proper manners for bike rallys, and more.<br /> I agree a lot with the last review that said it was geared for a man, because unfortunately it is.  Who knows, maybe someone will come a long and write an Etiquette for Outlaw Girls.	2002-02-23

I, personally, didn't see a problem with them wanting to &quot;Skip Christmas&quot;.  Heck sometimes I think that would be fun.<br />However, I must say that I found the ending to be a bit predictable.  Even thought it was predictable, it was still humorous.<br />I, myself, have never been a big fan of John Grishim...but this book was the exception to that rule.	2002-02-23
