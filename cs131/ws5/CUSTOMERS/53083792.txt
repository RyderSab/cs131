As a total amateur, I have no design training.  I am fascinated by architecture and design, but really only \\"know what I like\\".  I read \\"A Pattern Language\\" when working on object oriented computer systems and find it fascinating - I still re-read it.  So, when I saw this book, I was hoping that it would be interesting.<br /><br />It is way beyond interesting. It completely changed the way I look at the world. It deserves to be read carefully, slowly, savored.  Alexander makes his work accessible to both architects and lay people alike.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />Even with two kids in college, I am going to spring for book 2.

My mother is, by her own admission, an indifferent cook. But my grandmother was a country cook who taught me how to bake bread and heavenly cinnamon roles. I think this book would have pleased her. <br /> <br />The recipe that I really enjoyed a lot was the one for saltine crackers. I had to try it first, because it sounded so unusual.

Books	5	11	12	N	Y	Excellent advice for parents of ADHD kids	now that I have read this book, i can wholeheartedly recommend it to other parents.  Our two sons have ADD and have exhibited some (but not all) of the behaviors described in this book.   Fortunately we did not have the problems with violence he describes.  However, one of our sons became a champion wrestler and I think this was an excellent outlet for him. As Benjamin says, individual sports are very important for the ADD student.<br />He describes problems in school that accurately reflect our sons' school careers. Excellent grades on tests, next to no homework done, so low GPAs.  Like Benjamin, our older son is doing extremely well in college, because he is studying things that deeply interest him (physics) and not things that don't (english literature).<br />Two things I would change in terms of advice to other parents.  Benjamin says that kids should not be medicated daily. We have seen a specialist at NIH who says that the latest evidence shows that daily doses of ritalin or equivalent are actually beneficial. the brain seems to develop new neurotransmitter capabilities if the dosages are kept constant.<br />the other has to do with reading.  Our sons were not interested in reading until we discovered which topics interested them.  Our oldest is sports-crazed, so he learned to read box scores at age 5. the first words he read were Philadelphia and Chicago.  We bought lots of sports magazines and books and watched sporting events with him to reinforce what he learned in reading.  Our younger son was very interested in comics, so we bought every Calvin & Hobbs book. We read them to him over and over and later he learned to read them himself.  Great vocabulary builders!  Now both are voracious readers.  We kept the house  awash in books on many topics.  If they indicated an interest, we got books on that topic.  so they learned to enjoy books.<br />So, thanks to Benjamin for an inside look at a world that is very difficult for a non-ADD parent to fathom.  We wishyou well, Benjamin, and all the other parents who are out there dealing with this problem!  Your children can definitely grow up to be successful, though it may not feel like at when they are in third grade!	2003-11-02

Vachss is really getting to be an outstanding writer, in a technical sense. He also is great at developing characters and making them really three dimensional.

As the oldest of a similar family (six girls, two boys, Catholic, etc.), a lot of this book rang really true.  It's also selective, in the sense that the parents are shown as fonts of all wisdom and more than a little detached.  No matter how wonderful they were, they were undoubtedly also human. As a parent myself, I love to hear what they had to say about keeping their family going, balancing among the various kids, etc.  The best idea they had, in my opinion, was taking two weeks off by themselves every summer.  In 16 years of parenthood, we have only taken off one night without the kids...hmmm...  <br />The relationships among the siblings definitely is true to life, with all the love and all the bickering that real families go through. I love the fact that they have been able to come together and stay close even though there is a lot of distance among them geographically.  It's also very realistic that they have very different lifestyle choices, family situations and professions.  We all do, too.<br />Well worth the read.	2001-11-15

So, when I saw that this book was coming out, I ordered the audio version to listen to while driving to clients' offices.

Lots of exhortations and very little practical information on what to do in real life.  Lots of advice about being courageous and having wonderful ideas and getting a product champion, and... hope he is paying royalties to Tom...<br />The problem is probably the fact that the audio tape is an abridged version of the book.

(This book was not available; I  would have used it if it had been).  Suffice it to say that visits to the  principal, the teachers, etc. yielded sympathy but no protection.<br />We  finally got him a couple of books of insults and he practiced them at home.   He got to be really good at the funny comeback, the creative snap.  <br />It  wasn't our favorite solution, but it did work. He's even popular this year  because kids think it's funny.  The teasing has lessened, though no one at  this age is totally immune.  At least he didn't slug anybody and he's  getting some relief from the incessant comments.<br />So if the &quot;turn the  other cheek&quot; approach isn't working, buy a few insult books and see if  you can  make the best defense a good offense.	2000-04-14

Even though they are deeply in love,  they don't have the traditional happy ending.

Handy uses the personalities of the gods to typify certain management styles. It makes the styles more memorable and easier to discuss with colleagues.  I read it when it first came out and have used the concepts many times since.

I've been fortunate enough to work with five genuine Dionysus technologists in my career. I cherish them.  They can provide so much brilliant insight and can really save the whole project with their impressive skills. This book explains why it is futile to make them &#34;fit in&#34; and how to leverage what they can do in the best way.	1997-03-12

His section about applying the theory of valuechains to managed care has caused a lot of comment in our office.  In fact, I'm buying a second copy of the book today in self-defense because so many people want to borrow mine!  Jean Stanfor	1997-01-07
