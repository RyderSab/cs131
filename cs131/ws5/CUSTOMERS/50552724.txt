This cloying book is designed to soothe and nurture away your every worries and insecuries as you go through each stage of life from being born to growing up to mating to having children to growing old to finally waiting for the Grim Reaper, only that this comic strip really has nothing to do with real life, WHATEVER.<br /><br />In this book, the parents magically obtain a popular toy shop with a basement chock full of rare treasures that would make the family instantly rich and reunited with their own rugrat days. Then there's the heroic princes and princesses. Handsome young Michael and his doe-eyed blonde princess, Deanna decide to secretly elope to escape an overbearing old Queen who wants to throw her little girl a huge, glamorous wedding ceremony. And, Prince Michael's childhood pal has fled an odorious existence with his cruel stepfather to build a fabulous gas-service world with his sweet wifesy and two precious little cherubs. Princess Elizabeth has finally left her nubile \\"Lolita\\" phrase and blossomed into a pretty, perfect young woman who coyly avoids every male's desiring clutches and parties forever with her perfect, colorful roommate. And Little Princess April continues to look and act like a precocious kindergartner with innocence and spunkiness oozing out her ears at age 10 and even outsmarts a big bad bully before she SAVES his life.<br /><br />And the irony is that this comic strip had orginally started out as a SATIRE on the dewy-eyed world of family that \\"Family Circus\\" and \\"Hi & Lois\\" had built up during the Baby Boomer days. Today, I wouldn't even be surprised if a fire-breathing dragon suddenly appears out of the blue to snatch away Princess Elizabeth or one of Gordon's apple-cheeked tots.	2005-08-09

The real reason this series sold so big in America (as well as Japan) is because of its two obsessions: ideal youth and hormones.  <br /> <br />Like 90% (or perhaps even 100%) of all manga ever made, Love Hina is all about elaborate mating habits between little elfin adolescents with gem-like eyes to preserve the entire species of such cute creatures from dying out, of course! It's also a common fantasy for the budding lecher to end up with a whole harem of Lolita-aged supermodels within easy reach (like \\"No Need For Tenchi\\" and \\"Oh, My Goddess!\\") So why the constant \\"wardrobe malfunction\\", invitations to bath together, and carefully crafted \\"accidents\\" that would put a kid's face right between a chick's boobs or up her skirt? And oh, yeah, yeah, the victimized babe induces violence upon the poor offender as a cheap excuse for such childish smut. Why not just make it an outright baby pornography? Even the female tots act like little jezebels. <br /> <br />And it also takes place in a dreamy utopia of beaches, parties, and other youthful getaways. Very Barbiesque. Not to mention the fact it's about school, school, school, too.  <br /> <br />So I'm really disappointed. Like all comic books in the whole world, most manga is meant for young white adolescent boys. Probably a weird kind of modern Japanese initiation for them, too.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, I gave three stars for such nice, professional-looking artwork.	2005-01-23

I think the girl is a slut-wannabe rubbing up against her nerd boyfriend and trying to make his hormones shoot off like fireworks.

And Gramps loses his wife only to quickly fetch another to play a suffogate granny to the perfect kids. Of course, the parents themselves would stay young forever. Too bad the pets didn't live to see such a magical fairy-tale utopia the humans now inhabit. <br /> <br />The strip's only \\"realistic\\" (and most entertaining) character is none other than sweet-faced Deanna's mama who turns out to be such a scolding harpy of a mother-in-law who would turn Michael's otherwise perfect family life upside-down simply by making an uninvited appearance, of course.	2004-11-24

Two of our most famous sci-fi authors, Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg got together to produce a great \\"what if\\" story exploring how technology of a make-believe 21st-century lab could go far enough to bring right back a child from 40,000 years ago to live with a caregiver in a bubble.  <br /> <br />Miss Fellowes, who had been hired under very strict regulations to watch the prehistoric boy, had a kind of a sharp tongue and sometimes acted like a demented soccer mom, especially when nosey scientists and the media eagerly flocked over to gawk at the kid and make a big fuss over him. But she had fallen into love with the strange-looking Neandertal child and thus would never want to part with him. <br /> <br />The little boy named \\"Timmie\\" had turned out to be such a charming little angel in spite of his \\"unsightly\\" prehistoric appearance. And he had also ended up facing a very uncertain fate, especially with a scientist who brought him over, yet didn't intend to keep him forever, an overzealous child advocate who screamed bloody \\"child abuse\\", and a worried nurse who feared that he wouldn't survive in a prehistoric environment after a few years of learning to read and eat with a fork. <br /> <br />In addition to Timmie's heartwarming adventure in the modern times, we also get glimpses of the prehistoric tribe that he had left behind, which was now facing its own dangers forty thousand years back.	2004-08-09

But childbirth is originally for adding to the population, not just exciting a woman's most primal urges. So this kind of exploitation can be almost frightening in a whole new light.<br />So such books only objectify babies into trophies for women to covet after - and it's already long after the womenkind decided not to be labelled just as something that makes babies anymore.

And this is the world where all spoiled, smart-mouthed rugrats rule. And of course, this world is filled with playgrounds, mini-vans, and slobbering dogs that no one can ever get out.<br />Once again, Wanda has popped out still another baby (to keep the baby strip going, of course) and this one baby probably would remain a baby for all eternity to come, unless Wanda is willing enough to birth 20 more babies to support the cartoonists for the rest of their natural lives. However, I still love the rather cynical bite added to such a harried, closed-in family life of endless cleaning up, changing filthy diapers, soothing colicky demands, pumping dairy products from private parts, enduring catty competition with a next-door bimbo who bragged about spawning a double order of male heirs (and remaining svelte to boot), and finally dropping off womb fruits at a place called &quot;kindergarten&quot; for the first time. Family fun for the conserative readers who all live by the same old traditions as their ancient baby-boomer ancestors.<br />And neither Zoe, nor Hamface are wiggly little infants anymore - they are now big-headed little midgets to add more cute, cute, cute than ever to the whole mess!;)	2004-06-09

There is farting, bloody bowel movements, the baring of nipple to suckle an infant, maggots crawling through ravaged flesh, and burning corpses popping out of coffins to curl back like twigs. It's all raw and wide-open here. <br />But like all the greatest manga stories ever drawn and written, you will be hopelessly riveted all the way to the end as well as wanting to read it again and again to relive even the ugliest scenes ever to unfold on paper. For one of the most infamous pieces of Japanese history has been burned forever on the pages to be told and retold to the future generations yet to come. If they have strong hearts and stomaches for such a moving drama that the artist himself had unfortunately witnessed with his own young eyes.<br />But the grim story isn't without humor or some warmth that the heroic family shares and what's more, the characters are also well-drawn in the classic 1970s style with those bright, shining eyes, expressive mouths, and cute, chiseled noses.<br />In spite of all those masterful elements, the saddest of all true-to-life manga tales got to me so much that I don't know if I will ever own the series, let alone watch the anime, which I actually refused to see in the first place!	2004-05-05

The young genius, Christopher Paolini had graduated from high school at the early age of 15, so it's small wonder he has a great knowledge of history, norms, languages, etc. And he also has a GREAT sense of vocabulary for one so young...I was really blown away!<br />Written in the traditional fairy-tale vein of \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Lord of Rings\\", and even \\"Harry Potter\\", it is a coming-of-age story about a long-suffering young boy who was whisked away from his humble way of life by a sudden turn of events and found himself a legendary hero about to save the land - perhaps against his will. And it is told in such a breezy pace with beautiful, deft weaving of words that would quickly and easily conjure up colorful images as rich as those of Tad Williams' epic-spanning \\"Dragonbone Chair\\" tapestry. It is extremely fresh here - in spite of some negative reviews that the story is \\"predictable\\" and uses lots of fantasy cliches. That didn't stop the book from being such a great pleasure to read and follow the appealing characters into the thick of their spine-freezing adventures, of course.<br />The new twist of this tale includes a sapphire-bright dragon who accompanies the boy and becames his faithful servant as they head into the great wars to ward off the approaching evil and help bring justice back to the blighted land. And, she - yes, a female dragon - is portrayed as a very intelligent and even witty creature that you, too would come to befriend.<br />The young author is extremely lucky to have a very supporting family who even owns a publishing company to bring about this stunning book - even though it had gone through lots of editing process.

It takes place in Louisiana during the early part of 20th century, when Vivi (the young heroine of the book) officially formed a sisterhood with her three girlfriends that would last...amazingly...a whole lifetime.<br />Digging through a very crammed scrapbook, Sidda witnesses how her mother, Viva had gone through a Shirley Temple contest that ended badly (but hilariously), angrily defended her black maid from a snooty rich family, caught buck-naked by a policeman, lost a beau at a war, shipped off to a convert school, married a husband who more or less loved her, produced four babies in only a few years, drunkenly beat them with a belt, and finally suffered from a nervous breakdown that would land her in an instutition. And Vivi had been so lovingly supported by her three loyal female friends through all those trubulent years.<br />From curly-haired little girls to young pregnant hausfraus to old buzzards in sunglasses and scarves, The Ya-Ya Sisters adored each other so much it almost smacks of lesbianism (but not really.) And they love each other so much their own hubbies and kids are only second fiddles, of course. What's more, such sisterly relationship is just as romantically ideal as the one between Sidda and her husband-to-be, who is so warm and loving he might as well be Prince Charming in living flesh (or perhaps a mother's most tearfully wistful dreams?) <br />Overall, it's a sweet little fairy tale exclusively for ladies succulently packed with vivid descriptions that would tickle all of your five senses like the hot Louisiana sun, the spicy Southern dishes, and the endlessly flowing Bloody Marys. And yes, there is a harmlessly mawkish moment or two between Mama and LittleSidda, of course.<br />And in the very end, Sidda eventually made up with her eccentric, hot-bloodied mother - but still, it's small wonder the middle-aged daughter chose not to have any children of her own anyway!	2003-12-02

This is a very unusual story to come across in a comic book, though the plot itself has of course been done before, especially in a sci-fi book. <br />This story is all about a man who lives in the world where things go \\"backwards\\" all the way from the modern times to the untamed prehistory, yet people seem to take it as the normal way. In fact, those characters have NEVER ever heard of \\"death\\", especially since all babies go back into their mother's wombs at the \\"end\\" of their lives. (Isn't that a romantic notion?)  <br />The man is the \\"odd\\" one out, since he doesn't have a mother anywhere to return to her womb. So he goes on a guest that lasts many thousands of years before he finally finds the \\"answer\\". And he encounters many interesting people along the way, like women \\"without\\" husbands, wise old men who pass along wisdom, and families that come and go. Very nice artwork with more than a touch of realism in it - no muscular superheroes or beautiful women, sorry.	2003-05-13

The art is just so amazing to look at, especially those floating fairy islands suspended over a mystic world and all those colorful glowing lights that flow from the strangest sources, but the characters...well. They have already appeared MILLIONS of times before, especially in Disney movies and fairy tales like an evil uncle with one bad eye and a young swashbuckling Prince Charming whose shirt is loose enough to show off well-toned pecs. And young Sephie herself is the perfect prototype of any stereotyped fairy princess despite the fact her father is called a \\"minister\\" instead of a \\"king\\" in this story: she's pubescent, she's blonde, she's nubile, she's naive, and she's full of such wide-eyed innocence and tomboyish stubbornness. Not to mention the fact she doesn't have a mother (how typical.) Yet she goes out to save the entire world and turn it into a perfect upotia nearly overnight with magical powers that she has inadvertantly received from a mysterious source. And what's more...the flying boats greatly reminds me of Disney's most recent movie, \\"The Treasure Planet\\". How original. But other than that, the story is pretty decent and the art still pleasing to the eye in spite of the heavy use of computer to produce bright but artificial-looking colors.	2003-03-11

While I absolutely loved the very first volume of &quot;Strangers In Paradise&quot;, the second one is well, just okay. As usual, the art is well-drawn to the point of realism with a little cartooniness thrown in, of course...but what's with trying to present overweight, plain-looking broads as &quot;absolutely beautiful women&quot;? And the story itself does get a bit repugnant at some points, like Katchoo fondly caressing an AIDS patient who had gotten her into prostitution in the first place, not to mention a few sopping sappy scenes in some places. Nevertheless, it's still a very interesting yarn with some hair-raising action and shoot-'em-up adventures as well as a few really delightful cartoon-like dream sequences sandwiched in between!	2001-06-17

Let me tell you...I'm really glad I got this book because I enjoyed it a great deal and even LAUGHED REALLY HARD at some parts! It's a very honest adult-oriented tale all about Katchoo (what a curious name!), a very feisty young blonde who would wield a REAL gun at the sudden drop of a hat and her dark-haired girlfriend named Francine who is just so innocent and gullible she'd expect any man - even a real jerk like her womanizing boyfriend, Freddie to be sympathetic with her. But poor Francine got stood up and BADLY INJURIED as a result, so the ANGRY Katchoo decides to take the matters into her own hands! Also tagging along is an angelic-faced Japanese-looking young man who likes Katchoo so much he'd patiently take any man-bashing abuse the old girl would dish out to him! Heck, you'd like the good, funny story all about love, sex, betrayal, friendship, gender issues, and the stuff as well as the really nice artwork that even has some REALISTIC-LOOKING close-ups of the characters! Additional bonus: Terry Moore also includes a handful of rejected but amusing comic strips...	2001-06-07

Real sly, man.<br />Here in the third book, Sherman is his usual old man-eating self; Megan remains a shrewdish old missus; Fillmore continues to be your bookish cynic who just can't get a date; Hawthorne is still a stubborn and selfish old crab as usual; and the bespectacled Ernest is the very same computer-savvy nerd as ever before. <br />In other words, they are quite the same sea-dwelling characters we all know and love. Yet they are all caught up in the newest and silliest adventures - this time, in the show biz, the big romantic getaways, and the fishing contests. Why, they are even invaded by sea boogers, space dogs, and Bill Gates as well as a beached whale being talked out of a suicide and Megan getting PREGNANT!!!

It all begun when Naoko Takeuchi, still another aspiring female manga cartoonist decided to spin out a fairy-tale yarn all about a fun-loving young missy with such wide blue eyes and incredibly long blonde &quot;cowtails&quot; (they're PIGTAILS, okay???) who was chosen by an alien cat named &quot;Luna&quot; to save the world - or at least the mystic princess and a mysterious jewel rumored to hold immense powers hidden somewhere out there in the universe.<br />Our sweet 14-year-old heroine, Serena (or &quot;Bunny&quot;, if you like) had been assigned by her four-legged mentor to protect innocent folks from the evil as well as finding new members for the whole magic-wielding squad with celestic names like &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Sailor Mercury&quot;, &quot;Sailor Jupiter&quot;, and so on forth. However, the goofy kid behaved so irresponsibly like falling asleep during Luna's stern lectures, bumming free lunch off the other kids, and throwing temper tautrums whenever she had to do something unpleasant like attacking the enemy that you just gotta wonder whether the poor kitty had REALLY made a RIGHT choice in the first place???!! Nevertheless, Sailor Moon herself really pulled through as well as showing some real promise in the very end.

Either that, or they all rely on the same old formula: a pubescent young boy winds up into a very bizarre fantasy, becomes hero, gets pelted against a whole line of colorful opponents, chases a pretty girl, and being chased by a saucy young slut who insists on moving right into with him, sharing his bed, and cooking up horrid dinners for him. At least, that's what the whole plot is like for this one particular sequence from the whole series about a kid who's into boxing and his wistful infatuation for a dewy-eyed young nun in her flowing white robes and high-heeled laced boots. As usual, Kosaku is being forced to starve himself (oh, good grief...he isn't EVEN allowed a single drop of water!) and going through a very rigorous training program where he is being whipped half to death by a ruthless coach so he would become a victorious boxer someday. (What a great example to teach the innocent young Japanese children!) This time, Kosaku has to face about three very scary villains in the ring: a spoiled young boxer-wannabe who tries to thrawt Kosaku's self-discpline by tempting him with all sorts of rich food his money could buy, a gutsy Mexican choir-boy who uses a secret weapon to put a very tricky handicap on Kosaku, and a dangerous-looking truck driver whose busty girlfriend (moll?) had ran away from his very dominating behavior (he wanted the girl to retain her perfect figure) to coyly drape her manipulative little self upon the poor boy's anoxeric shoulders. Caught up in all those very baffling conflicts, innocent young Sister Angela watches and worries and frets and prays and nevertheless cheers Kosaku on. While keeping her real feelings at bay, of course.	2000-11-06

Already an acclaimed cartoonist who did the world's thickest comic books on the great history of our universe (in two volumes the size of phone books), Larry Gonick goes on to create a very informative book all about sex - with lots of really funny cartoons thrown in, of course! In fact, this nifty book really covers just about everything you would ever want to (or not) know  about - ranging from mating behavior amongst the critters to women's self-defense to all types of contraceptives and how they actually work (or don't work!) Even the most &quot;repugnant&quot; subjects are included here, like gynecological exams and the &quot;fetishes&quot; of breastfeeding. Once again, we are warned here that we need to be careful about the great riskes of unwanted pregnancies and STDS whenever we &quot;make love&quot; (oh, yes! Even the most baffling term, &quot;love&quot; is discussed here!) Serving as illustrations are all those really cute and (sometimes very frank) line drawings so typical of good ol' Dr. Gonick you can even expect to see a funny dinosaur or two! Those cartoons are really bursting with such good-natured humor it would certainly put even the most squirmish reader at ease. Nevertheless, such a wealth of sexual and biological facts (as well as such zany comic art to go with it) seem to be printed on rather flimsy, low-grade paper so typical of any illegal porno pulp. Too bad, but it looks like those  newprint-like pages would quickly turn yellow and become quite brittle and dog-eared the moment you brought it home from the bookstore!	2000-10-31

Divided into several short tales, this book seems to follow the romantic adventures of a pixie-cute young boy with such an innocent big-eyed face and the height of a young child (despite this, he could still deliver a real whallop with his little fist!) who had developed a love interest in a fair-haired young tomboy (who had eventually grown into a very feminine young woman over the years.)

Here you are treated to a fleeting glimpse of such memorable childhood full of fun-filled moments as well as tortureous, self-sacrificing, and long-suffering parenthood driven by unconditional love, political correctness, and guilt trips to make it possible! Now Zoe is five years old and finally in kindergarten after long, slow ten years of being such a rotten little brat despite the very fact she was tenderly fed on 100% organic Grade-A human milk and carefully discplined by timeouts and logic reasoning rather than just a quick swat across her precious pullup-covered tush. Today, she's still as arrogant and unpleasant as ever - bullying her kid brother, yelling at her parents, and demanding everything HER WAY. And the still-infantile Hammie is not much better, either. He's just as charming as sliced ham in an Oscar-Meyer packaging and he seems to be a bit obsessed with his toy trucks (he likes to putter all over the whole house, leaving dirty tracks, and making &quot;truck&quot; noises with his unweaned tongue). And what's more, he also screams and gets greedy just like his big bad sister! Still reluctant, gullible, and sarcastic as ever, Zoe and Hammie's parents brace themselves for some new hands-on experiences with an escaped school hamster, booger-related incidents, slumber parties with giggly-squeaky little girls, messy potty-training, and (dis)organized soccer games! One thing our sick and tired heroes would've wished they had known in the first place, though...no one would condemn you to hell if you didn't even bother to procreate at all.

Drawn in this adorable, whimsical cartoony style rather like Calvin and Hobbes (ooh...how I HATE imitations, but this seems to work here), it's all about a very spunky little girl who likes to dress up, play make-believe, dance in a glittery pink tutu and ragged stockings, bawl at sad movies on the tube, and tease her divorced mom about getting another man! Very girlish, yet it's got plenty of wit and a very insightful view about what it's like to be a single young mother living by herself with an very imaginative child and her hyperactive buddies in the very middle of a city as well as those terrific movie take-offs (especially of Star Wars) featuring our plucky young heroine in her famous demin bonnet and ballerina slippers!	2000-09-28

Just imagine having read nearly 100 pages and you HAVEN'T even begun the book yet! Nevertheless, despite my very impatience, I managed to bulldoze my way through Appel Jr.'s notes on Vladimir Nabokov's brilliant masterpiece and as a result, I learned quite  a little about the Russia-born genius as well as his other books and all the tricks he had up his sleeve with writing such a clever book like that. Satire and word-play are discussed here. Even the most unlikely references like a Bugs Bunny cartoon, a Dick Tracy comic strip, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland are mentioned. Now this is indeed intriguing, though it took me several days to digest this all down. By the way, the author who included the annotated notes was once the faithful student of the famed author himself back in the early 1950s, so he really launched himself into the great project of dissecting &quot;Lolita&quot; and comparing it to Nabokov's other books and some literary works of the old as well as including pages and pages of footnotes to explain each and every of what is happening throughout the whole book (I'm afraid this would mean constantly moving back and forward as you read!) Nevertheless, with all those uncanny indications and some shrewd observations, Appel. Jr. himself turns out to be just as sharp as his illustrative friend is.	2000-09-27

It's simply a NOVEL idea for Stephen King to build up on the great  suspense by installing one piece after another into six separate parts (no  pun intended!) And I really caught up on this little scheme by rushing  right out to buy a book and then really squirm around until the very next  one comes right out the following month! Or, you can buy the whole thing in  a single book - with a considerate lowering of the great thrill of  foreshadowing events, of course.<br />Paul Edgecombe, the aging ex-guard  shrewdly spins out a fabulous tale of meeting John Coffey, a hulking  African-American supergiant who had been arrested for the brutal deaths of  little twin sisters and thus sentenced to sit on the &quot;Ol'  Sparky&quot;. It all took place in 1932, when capital punishment was more  widely accepted at the time. At first, it looked for all the world like  Coffey really deserved it - but as time passed by, Edgecombe began to have  serious doubts about it because of Coffey's very childlike innocence and  truly amazing talents that he seemed to possess. Entering the whole picture  is a very clever little mouse that seemed to bring a bit of humanity into  the bleak environment of the infamous Death Row. And after a whole series  of real heart-stopping events, Paul Edgecombe soon found himself about to  make some very DIFFICULT moves involving the poor baby-faced Coffey.<br />A  truly enthralling thriller streaked with a little fantasy, a good deal of  tongue-in-cheek humor, and plenty of exciting and really scary adventures  that will make you hold your breath until it's nice and safe enough to  pass. With a little dash of Stephen King's age-old recipe of gruesome  horrors thrown in, of course! One thing about the movie, though (I haven't  seen it yet) - I thought of Paul Edgecombe as more of a rumpled,  middle-aged cherub than the youthful-looking Tom Hanks in a very natty  guard's uniform.	2000-08-27

She would moan and  whine about the lack of a boyfriend, her zits, her weight, her looks, and  her annoying baboon-like older brother to her best friend, who herself was  once a nerd with big owlish eyeglasses and blahy hair. And then through  more than a decade of really zany adolescent adventures with shopping  sprees, makeovers, sleepovers, drug-busting, cheerleading tryouts,  catfights with Tiffany the Miss Perfect, dating the school geek, losing  swimsuit bras in a public pool, and nearly losing a friend to cancer, we  gradually grew to truly sympathize with the poor self-conscious little  &quot;born loser&quot; feverishly struggling and clawing her way through  puberty, school, and self-image. Then - all of a sudden, Luann blooms into  a very pretty, busty 16-year-old blonde bombshell with a very nice figure  and a rather overzealous self-confidence. Now that she's finally in high  school, she at last has a job, a real boyfriend, and...about to get a  driver's license so she can get around more freely. Therefore - maybe it's  time to RETIRE the strip altogether now that Luann is nearly a Miss Perfect  herself. At least her overweight, less-than-ideal bro is still his funny  old Oreo-chomping self after all. Nice simple cartoony drawings that most  teens can relate to.	2000-08-13

Actually, the heroine in this story is no  supermodel with luscious lips and professional eye makeup - but an innocent  little girl who was forced to wear a mask because her face had been cruelly  disformed by the wicked witch who kept her and all her beloved pets  prisoners by painfully embedding precious jewels into various parts of  their bodies to keep them from escaping. But the heroine and her animal  friends all managed to escape and then went off on a very perilous journey  in search for an enchanted dragon who would free them from their hurts and  handicaps. And at the same time, an unkempt knight soon came across the  unlikely troop and thus decided to join them. The great adventures that  followed took very wild turns and twists into VERY scary situations as well  as truly magical scenes that any fantasy fans would gladly indulge in. Very  humorous and whimsical, yet...also sexist in a sense. Especially the ending  which I DIDN'T LIKE AT ALL!  So I never even bothered to finish it at all.  Too Cinderella and Snow-Whitish for my liking. But if you can get past this  kind of arrogance on the author's part, you would doubtlessly enjoy it  anyway.	2000-08-09

After tea ceremonies, circus acts, and Hawaiian surf-up, Ranma engages into  a painfully rigorous training with REFINED ETIQUETTE FOR GOURMET DINING.  However, even with all such savory French delicacies right under his young  button nose, Ranma still ends up being sent to bed hungry. And, Picolet's  really BIZARRE hereditary gives him a great advantage over all the  speed-eating contests, so...Ranma has to find ANOTHER way quickly or he  would be doomed to wear the tightly-laced iron corset so ruthlessly forced  onto his nubile young girl's body AND eventually become Picolet's bride!  And one of Akane's sisters, Nabiki is finally given the new role as a main  character in the second story. So a sibling rivalry suddenly crackles in  the air and Ranma finds himself with a SWITCHED fiancee...none other than  Nabiki herself! Now all the lovestruck rivals had caught the wind of it, so  poor Ranma is forced to shield the coy-faced young Nabiki from being  viciously attacked.

It's not very surprising that Wendy Froud happens to be the wife of the renowned fantasy artist, Brian Froud himself, who is quite famous for his very unique fairy and faerie creations. And Terri Windling's writing isn't  too shabby here, either. So with all Mrs. Froud's very life-like  arrangement of faery figures so elaborately designed and dressed and then  carefully positioned within an equally believable woodland setting, Ms.  Windling's fairy tale begins with the busy preparation for a great  ceremonious faery festival: The Midsummer Night - as derived from one of  William Shakespeare's famed plays. The hero of this tale is a very humble  little Sneezle, who happens to be a sleepy-eyed wingless faery of the tree  roots. He wants so much to be part of the much bristling about, yet he  keeps getting underfoot or into a big mess. So the poor innocent little  creature is quite crestfallen, yet he does not yet know that he would soon  be playing a very crucial role in thrawting the crafty plans of an evil  faery about to overtake the whole faery realm! Yet...young Sneezle just  does NOT has much courage or any skill to fight at all - a very unusual  kind of a fantasy protagonist. Beautifully written with a rustically poetic  style and marvelously illustrated by all those well-made dolls that would  truly delight any fantasy fans and serious fancier of fairies and faeries!	2000-07-28

Unfortunately, I didn't get very far - especially after my unfortunate  experience with the other Xanth book, &quot;Ogre Ogre&quot;, which carried  so many blatantly sexual references to the female characters as well as  lecherous behavior from the males. This book here very obviously has the  same thing. Too bad I'm female and WELL over the age limit. In fact, I was  actually THE SAME AGE as the hero, who was about 25 at the time. So the  double standards prevented me from taking a carefree romp into Uncle Piers'  Fun-'N'-Pun Land. Oh, well - too many unwashed little boys and street punks  casually hanging around it.

Must've made a very bittersweet nostalgic trip for the  old-timers who were quite terrified of the looming Y2K as well as a new  curiosity for the younger generations. Drawn in very simple shapes and  written with simple gags, &quot;Mutts&quot; features a happy-go-lucky alley  cat and his innocent-looking canine buddy who go out on the night to raid  trash cans, break into a local butcher shoppe, perform long serenades to  the full moon, and occasionally get whisked off into colorful fantasy  adventures complete with a Buster-Brownesque punchline.

That arrogant little kid rules over the whole household with a very  sticky fist. She's forever lost in her own little fantasy world and whether  she's back in the &quot;reality&quot;, she's always throwing temper  tantrums, demanding her way, molesting her big sister's personal things,  leaving such disgusting messes (including fecal matter in the pet rabbit's  litter box), and just plain driving the poor middle-aged mother right out  of her mind with her &quot;cutesy&quot; antics. In fact, she even gets  involved into two real crisises; one at the riverbank that cost the life of  the poor old Farley and the other that left Jeremy Jones with a broken leg  in the hospital.

Nevertheless, it was a very interesting  piece of history all about one of the 20th century's greatest  actors.<br />Here we are taken on Chaplin's very long tour from the London  slums of his Victorian-Era childhood through the early Hollywood studios  with The Keystone Kops and Mabel Normand, his lovely young co-star to his  finally peaceful post-career days with his very last wife, Oona O'Neill at  his beautiful home in Switzerland. And here he even paid a little respect  to a few women who would haunt his memories like Lita Grey, his ill-fated  second wife who was still passing her puberty at the time and Joan Barry,  the vengeful hellcat who eventually dragged him to the court for paternity  tests.<br />Thus this is just one of the countless biographies all about the  funny little man. Nevertheless - right behind Chaplin's comical mask is a  great velvet-padded tiger sleepily reclining in the hot limelight - yet he  is quite capable of suddenly lashing out to deal a painful, blood-tracing  blow when sourly displeased.	2000-07-20

Unfortunately, O'Neill turned out to be such a mean-spirited  old toad so deadbeat he made Prince Charles seem such a warm-hearted saint  in comparsion. Thus his great arrogance eventually destroyed the lives of  more than a few people involved, including his sons who had ended up on  drugs and alcohol. Nevertheless, the innocent young princess relentlessly  continued her persistent waif-like attempts to attract her father's  attention, including her Miss America-like debut into a ritzy New York club  and going into acting in Hollywood. Instead, she got the ultimate  brush-off. But then - a great knight in a shining armor upon a white steed  came along to scoop up the lost little Oona into his strong, capable arms.  This gallant knight is none other than Charlie Chaplin himself! Despite the  very fact he was reputed as a selfish, abusive old egotist who used to prey  on pubescent little girls, he actually turned out to be the perfect answer  to young Oona's desperate prayers as well as the vice versa. So happily,  Chaplin's new child-bride settled down to a blissful domestic life of  hosting parties and making babies. <br />Unfortunately, this story just didn't  stop at the &quot;happily ever after&quot; part. Instead, everything went  into a spiralling nosedive from there. First, Charlie Chaplin was  ruthlessly hounded for his past &quot;wrongdoings&quot; as well as being  unfairly labelled a &quot;communist&quot; and then the whole family was  kicked right out of America altogether. And then there was the painful,inevitable part of aging and dying on Chaplin's part, though Oona kept  smiling graciously through the whole ordeal. Finally, though the old man  truly loved his youthful wife, he kept an iron grip on her so powerful she  was left lost and helpless once again at his death. <br />A very sad but  true-to-life fractured fairy tale all about the &quot;Daddy's girl&quot;  who never was.	2000-07-18

But at least it is speaking out for the rights of the workers and everyone else in general who chose to be CF. <br />Do you see some  peculiar ironies here? We now have about 6 billion people living on this  tiny planet. And more are being born to be added to this ever-growing  population. In fact, it's been predicted we might reach about 10 or 12  billion by 2020 or so, if I get the statistics correctly. This does put a  strain on our society; one of the results meaning that we have to work  longer and harder for more and more people. In fact, our weekends could  very possibly be cut out someday so we would have to put in all this extra  workload. What does that leave our children? Alone and lonely and needy. So  any company that wants to show its concern decides to create some  privileges for the working parents so they can take some time out to tend  to the needs of their families like newborn infants and sick children. Of  course, that would be quite beneficial to the harried, overworked parents.  BUT, if Elinor Burkett is right, then it is not fair that companies are  arrogantly exploiting the childless or childfree workers for the sake of  all the parents and their families. Not to mention the still-ignorant  atttitudes toward the without-children segment of the whole population. So  the big irony here is that if the CF lifestyle is more widely accepted,  then its rate would be allowed to climb until it at least fills half of the  whole population. As a result - much to unspoken fears for the entire  humanity - the very number of people may take a very drastic and terrifying  nosedive down to ... perhaps about 3 billion or so at the most. Therefore,  the whole pressure would be finally taken off and perhaps we can even all  get to go home at about 2pm in the afternoon and ..... thus the parents  would have much more time with their children! Not to mention the finally  relieving of stress, fatigue, and bad tempers especially to the poor kids  who obviously didn't deserve it in the first place. See the huge irony? Try  &quot;Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home And Home Becomes Work&quot; for a  closer look at the big picture. <br />One more thing I'd like to add: not all  children are just spoiled brats; they are only innocent young human beings  with very real needs. But - kids can still be very smart and caring people  as well.	2000-07-14

Tolkien's great galaxy of hobbits, wizards, dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons that he so deftly invented all by himself is quite vastly celebrated throughout the 20th century. In fact, his unique vision  is so immensely popular that anything tasting of mystic whimsicality is at  once labelled &quot;Tolkienesque&quot;. And over the years, his very first  story, &quot;Hobbit&quot; had been getting its share of artwork from many  different artists. Some are brilliantly colorful and others are just plain  drab. Here in this 60th-anniversary book with the title in gold, Alan Lee  created very gray watercolor paintings for its illustrations.  Unfortunately, I find them quite dry and lifeless though he does have a  good hand at drawing characters, trees, and mountainous passes. Instead, I  would have preferred brilliant, deeply detailed fantasy art dramatically  showing every emotion, every conflict, and every magic-working either in  full colors or in very dark, gloomy tones.

Though the stories and yes, the art itself still had its flare, I just don't like the cheap-looking, slapped together collection with all its rather shoddy-looking b&amp;w reprints. I have seen the stuff in full color  in the comic book format and they're not all that bad. But I had felt a  little cheated once I first opened this little book after waiting several  years for the latest stories to be collected together in a volume. Maybe  the producers were growing quite worried that all those diehard Elfquest  fans out there might stampede or they simply didn't have as much money to  print the stuff as they used to. Hey, I could wait a few more years if this  means a nice full-color job in a nice format as The Elfquest Duo had  originally done back in the 1980s and the early 1990s. But unfortunately,  it also seems like The World of Two Moons had been so freely placed into  the hands of the other writers and artists. Mmm...maybe you should really  retire the Elfquest altogether, Wendy and Richard Pini - and we will truly  understand. But we will still remember your great work in the past.	2000-06-11

But the strict condition of striking it rich is that he better not touch a single dollar bill until he at least graduates from the college  and gets a wife. And along comes a very mysterious con artist in the form  of a sleek young sexpot to cattily manuipulate and guilt the poor kid into  giving in - though he VERY STUBBORNLY refuses to despite the actual sexual  scenes which are very titillating indeed as well as home-cooked dinners  (which the girl obviously isn't as good at). In addition, the young hero's  got a role with a play he's rehearsing and he happens to be IN LOVE with a  much older but nevetheless pretty young woman in charge of the whole setup.  And what really tangles things up is the sudden involvement of the  scar-faced gangsters at the play that the young &quot;harlot&quot; had  secretly invited along! Though this stuff is supposed to be from  &quot;Pulp&quot;, a special new manga for the mature audience, the  characters themselves seem to be forever in their pubescent stage as in  virtually all the other cartoons from Japan, both hand-drawn and animated.	2000-06-09

It all begun with the high-school courtship between Joe and Marcy.

Then the whole family goes tumbling into the wildest adventures  with a bragging Pop and a doting Mom, household chores, police car chases,  shootin' up with the bad guys, the hectic emergency room, the crazy  day-care scene where small kids all act like grown-ups, and of course,  Sunny's very bushy, untamed hair! And it's all told in a true-to-life vein  shot through with intoxicating flights of fantasy and very saucy,  well-crafted satire, especially where Joe turns into a very muscular  superhero every time his ego gets stroked and the whole family being chased  around the house by rabid IRS agents!

Despite the whole mumbo-jumbo of spirituality nonsense about human-cat relations, I nevertheless enjoyed those delightful photos of cats actually standing up on their hind legs to dance with their equally agile owners.  What gives this very artful book a great whimsicality is how those humans  all dressed up in such colorful costumes like a little girl clad in a fairy  garb, a veiled harem dancer, black-lipped Gothic actors, and the like,  including a heavyset lady in purple tatters very gracefully twirling about  with her very shaggy Persian kitty named Boots.

A very serious fan of manga and anime will like this very intriguing study of the immensely popular Japanese medium. It takes you on a tour from the fables of the feudal times through the 19th-century political satire to the  use of cartoons to taunt the American soldiers during the WWII to the great  mushrooming of popularity in today's &quot;manga&quot; and  &quot;anime&quot; that we all know and enjoy greatly. We are also  introduced to Osmau Tezuka the very reowned &quot;father&quot; of the  modern manga and anime. In fact, he was quite aptly dubbed &quot;the god of  manga&quot; when he first began creating comics quite similar to the Disney  style of 1930s; thus bringing some real entertainment to the bored children  of the post-war era. His work includes AstroBoy the cute little flying  robot and Kimba The White Lion (ironically, Disney actually  &quot;borrowed&quot; from Mr. Tezuka's work while making &quot;The Lion  King&quot; WITHOUT knowing it at all - a real repay, of course!) Other than  those sweet children's tales, Osamu Tezuka also launches very serious  projects such as BlackJack the eccentric surgeon and a very long saga about  a young man finally meeting the legendery but vain Phoenix in her very own  flesh. In addition, you get treated a few samples of the best work from the  other well-known manga artists, including the very sparkly and flowery  &quot;Rose of Versasilles&quot;.	2000-06-03

And you are also  introduced to a great variety of Japanese comics, well-known or not -  including the perverted, gross-out, and graphically violent ones that no  American page will ever accept! You will personally witness the very  evolution of the medium all the way from the prints of feudal days to a  whole cultural spawn of both manga and anime alike that frequently (for  some reason) feature the usual skinny, wide-eyed high-schooler, but not  quite always. In addition, we learn all about the very surprising  consquences caused by the very creation of manga, including the tragic  incident of tear-gas bombing in the Toyko subways; women already into their  30s trying to look like little girls in sailor uniforms; and the massive  censorship of the most offending manga.

I used to watch the TV series on and off during the late 1970s before I was introduced to Laura Ingalls Wilder's true-to-life adventures out on the frontier. Unfortunately, the Pa character on the TV just doesn't bear any  resemblance at all to the real-life father of the famous little girl under  her sunbonnet. In fact, the real Pa had a BEARD while the one played by the  late Michael Larson just looked too macho and youthful.<br />In Mrs. Ingalls  Wilder's second story, the family had to move out of The Big Woods in  Wisconsin to go traveling across the great open prairie lands in a covered  wagon. The two little girls, Laura and her sister, the blonde Mary both  experienced very daunting incidents ranging from their own father falling  into a raging river to Ma's leg getting pinned under a heavy log from the  new home they were building to the sudden loss of their faithful dog, Jack.  But it is also a very eye-opening experience for the modern kids as told in  the aged heroine's very own words.<br />Laura's tales very vividly paints her  childhood days out in the wilds during the late 19th century like pies made  out of underripe apples, the very construction of a real log house with its  cavernous fireplace which was big enough to stand in, the sudden visit from  the Native Americans and all! Garth Williams, the reowned illustrator of  children's books also provides realistic pictures of what it was like to be  a little girl in the pioneering times.	2000-06-02

When I first picked up this big, juicy book featuring the early work on Lum &amp; Co., I did not KNOW that the great creator of this series happens to be a WOMAN and a very talented one! Thus I was really quite surprised -  and very impressed!<br />It all begun with a very idiotic young high schooler  with an abnormal sex drive and a whole run of bad luck who was suddenly  forced to play a tag game with one of the alien invaders about to overtake  the entire planet. And his opponent turned out to be a very beautiful,  shapely young girl with demon's horns, a tigerhide binkini suit complete  with striped stockings...and teeth just like a real tiger's! Not to mention  the fact she could fly and emit very painful electric shocks! So Ataru got  spooked by this strange newcomer who WANTS to become his wife AND come  between him and his poor, long-suffering girlfriend, Shinobu. And that's  not all...the unfortunate boy's life gets turned upside-down with frequent  visits from a whole circus parade of bizarre alien creatures, sexy young  babes, and folklore characters straight out of ancient Japanese  legends!<br />Those wonderful &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; stories are quite  full of cunning creativity, fast-paced action, flightful fantasy, sci-fi  imagery, and very boisterous juvenile-level humor!

But then you'll fall in love with all the spunky, fun-loving  characters like the courageous teenaged Tenchi and his five wacky female  housemates with their offbeat hairdos like the devilish Ryoko, her  &quot;mother&quot; the youthful-looking scientist, Washu; the pretty  princess from outer space, Ayeka and her sweet little sister, Sasumi; and  the resourceful space police, Mihoshi. Not to mention their charming little  rabbit-cat pet, Ryo-oh-ki with the most amazing trick: he could turn into a  spaceship in  the time of need! <br /> In this story, Tenchi &amp; Co.  suddenly encountered Ryoko's wild twin named Minagi who is out for blood!  So Tenchi and Ryoko fiercelly battled Minagi and knocked her out, thus  causing her to lose her memory. And along comes Yakage who wants to test  Tenchi's legendary sword and thus he made off with the lovely Ayeka in the  very end. But better read all about it to find out!

First, he completely shuns the public eye,  preferring to remain private and anonymous while dropping only a few hints  about his personal life. Then, he took very long sabbatical days (yes, VERY  long) from the strip, thus resulting in endless reprints. And finally, he  wanted to rearrange the whole Sunday format. I'm sorry, but we no longer  live in the more lesuirely days when we would pore forever over the much  longer and more detailed story. Besides, the today's funny pages always  have to make room for us new cartoonists. In fact, Bill Watterson's demands  that he is given more space for his bigger and more elaborate work did  remind me of a spoiled rotten sports superstar constantly quarreling with  his coaches and managers. Ironically, though he absolutely refused to allow  his characters to be merchandised, it is his own work that feeds his very  sensitive ego. Thus the overblown popularity of Calvin and Hobbes ended up  as its downfall, especially with the unwanted boom of bootleg shirts that  depict the characters saying and doing nasty, deviant things - much to the  great injury of the poor man's pride. So - sadly, that's why I carefully  avoid his cartoons, however marvelous they may be.	2000-05-24

Very witty and humorous as well! But I must warn you, this  book has some real TEETH despite the very fact it's all about our very own  fat huggable old orange meatball of Garfield himself that we've known and  loved for over 20 years. VERY SHARP TEETH. In fact, a couple of stories are  pretty scary and there are some mild vulgarity especially in the Viking  part as well as...oh, yes!...some bad words. But right after my very first  initial shock, Garfield's wild and colorful Viking life turned out to be my  most favorite!

Anyway, here in very first book, a poor young boy who desperately needs to be laid suddenly finds that the object of his youthful lust, Moemi has taken her sloe-eyed interest in his best friend, a handsome but vain Takashi at his high-class private school. So in order to nurse his sorrows, Yota Moteuchi wanders into a video store which had miraclously appeared in the name of his &quot;pure heart&quot;. So he eagerly takes an X-rated video home to indulge in all the pleasure so unfortunately denied him in real life. Thus he met Ai, the charming but egotistic young TV strumpet who suddenly fell right off the screen to devote herself to improving the boy's life and serving his every need - much to his unwilling horror. What about dear, sweet little Moemi???!! But ah, she's trotted off to timidly acknowledge her undying adoration to the aloof Takashi, who merely treated her like dirt. And what's more, the stubbornly determined Ai's got her arm tightly locked around poor Moteuchi's throat! So maybe Moteuchi and Moemi are much better off going together??? Hm...let's wait and see! Good artwork with very delicate shading and even delicater details of Moteuchi's overdramatic, moist-eyed emotions and luscious, nearly pedophilic shots of young schoolgirls' underwear. Nevertheless, despite my lifelong love for manga and anime, I'm sorry but I'm not very interested in some kid's juvenile triumphs and woes with romance and dating.	2000-05-16

Discovered all mangled and strewn  about in a mucky junkyard, Alita was tenderly nursed back to health and  brought up by a loving father-like scientist. Now resurrected, Alita  becomes a very brave cyborg warrior who sets out to fight hideous monsters,  crafty villains, and evil clones of herself. Very dramatic shots, strong  facial expressions on all the characters, clever camera angles, a very  imaginative sci-fi setting, and...the most of all, such startlingly  GORGEOUS drawings so deftly drafted in each panel with the most amazingly  microscopic details and such breathtaking depth. Unfortunately, those truly  magnificent visions are just not for the ones with prude minds, faint  hearts or weak stomaches. For the very same art that I'm just talking about  is also full of such eye-popping violence, very wet bloodbath, and just  plain sick sadism so graphically depicted here that anyone with an  inexperienced eye would just reel back with horror and nausea upon picking  up this book for the very first time. But if you could get past this mucous  layer of such shocking material, you would definitely enjoy this very  thrilling adventure with all its remarkable characters and a very  interesting storyline!	2000-05-15

With his help, Kagome wards off the very repulsive  Centipede Lady, who is after the magical jewel that she had been  unknowingly carrying ever since ... she had been laid to burn on the pate  in the olden days.

Much to my envious amazement, the lady manga superstar, Rumiko Takahashi cunningly spins out a very wacky fable all about a young Chinese-bred boy and his father who accidentally fell into the cursed springs of China  during their rigorous training, thus turning into whatever had drowned in a  certain pool. The boy's old man finds himself magically transformed into an  oversized panda with an oversized appetite whenever he gets splashed by  cold water. And poor young Ranma himself gets morphed into the worst  nightmare for a proud male: a very sexy and curvy young girl with a front  full of the ripest knockers. And what's more, Ranma is destined to marry an  arrogant young Akane in order to inherit her father's training school,  which is yet to see its very first student ever since its foundation. And  along comes Ryoga (if he can find his way) who has the real hots for the  pretty and very althetic (yes, VERY althetic) Akane who didn't really care  for boys to begin with. AND the haughty upperclassman, Kuno himself got the  HOTS for poor Ranma trapped in his feminine shape. Thus fireworks really  flew at the Tendo Dojo residence and the local high school.

US	50552724	R22X1PKOMSBLH7	0345368991	85405238	The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall	Books	3	1	17	N	N	Probably good, but much too hard for me to read	When I first picked up Anne McCaffrey's book all about the great dragons of Pern a long time ago, all I could manage were the first few pages where all the dragons swooped through the alien skies to destroy the falling Threads with their fire and a character witnessed the very first hatching  of a baby Dragon. And the author's other book all about a dinosaur planet  was equally difficult as well. I'm very sorry to say this, but I'm afraid  Ms. McCaffrey uses far too many &quot;big words&quot; as well as  long-winded descriptions of everything ever to happen to a certain  character and this and that long before the very beginning can ever be  finished and over with by the time the story itself needs to get going. I  may be one of those restless readers who like to skim smoothly through a  whole tale and take everything in as I go by without struggling and plowing  through what this word and that word means and taking a whole sentence  apart in order to understand it before I can go on. Too bad I didn't enjoy  my visit to the mythical land of Pern, but - oh, well - I'm probably as  lazy as a lion in a bed of dandelions!	2000-05-02

It's much more serious and sophisticated in a graphic novel format and the gothic mood is more captured in this way. And it also demonstrates quite elegant drawings of the beautiful, sexy Catwoman in her shiny sewn-together costume  and the virile Batman in his handsome bat get-up with its long, sweeping  cape. Their lithesome stunts and fierce struggles on the moonlit rooftops  are artfully depicted in each panel as well. As for the Penguin himself, he  provides a very colorful, circus-like flavor to the story with his kooky  penguins and his gaudily-costumed associates. In addition, there are many  grisly deaths and a much more tragic ending as well. In all, this film  adaptation is quite a lovely little comic album to keep anywhere on your  most favorite bookshelf!	2000-04-29

I've always liked Bill Peet's work ever since I was a young girl because of his very zany style that he had inherited from his days at Disney's Studios. His illustrations in his delightful books for kids are quite elegant and humorous as well and he also had a poetic talent for creating  animal fables all about lessons taught in a certain character's life. Here  I recently came across this very amusing tale all about five crowardly  lions who had to face the stage-fear of a big circus audience gawking at  them. So the owner of the Big Top was forced to hire a very cruel  lion-tamer to whip them into obedience. Instead, the five poor lions all  began to howl and howl despite being threatened to be sold away or fed  nothing but lettuce and heavily sprayed with water from elephants' trunks.  And the whole circus suffered as a result from the mistreatment of such  noble creatures like lions. What a beautiful story that carries a very  stern moral that everyone of any age will understand at once!	2000-04-27

At first, I didn't really like the comic strip all about babies and parenting, which simply isn't my cup of tea. But - over the time, I began to truly appreciate what a vaulable contribution it could be to our  society: a pretty stern disclaimer to the usual maternal fantasy that every  young girl holds dear to her heart when she is old enough to get married  and produce children. The not-so-nice part of having babies like labor  pains, breastfeeding, dirty diapers, vomiting, screaming temper tantrums,  shot nerves, etc. are all so candidly depicted here on the very pages of  our funnies. In fact, it seems to me that if it wasn't for the kinship ties  and the anxious need to support the future species, Darryl and Wanda  would've probably been very happy to simply drop off Zoe and Hammie at a  nearby orphanage.	2000-04-25

This is the very first book I have ever read about the great adventures of the gallant Redwall critters. In fact, it was quite a sudden discovery in a local college bookstore and now a whole new world dramatically opens up to a diehard fan of anthropomorphic animals like myself ever since the good old days of Pogo and Wind in the Willows.<br /> Here this tale takes  place about two badger brothers, one an albino and the other one a lord of  the seaside Salamanderstron mountain taking revenge upon a blue-eyed weasel  and his bloodthirsty gang for killing their parents when they were both  helpless little newborns. And the humble inhabitants of the Redwall Abbey  are suddenly drawn into the bold new epic that involves alot of warmaking,  scheme-hatching, journeying into the perilous unknown, fighting an  unexpected epidemic and a sea monster, and such courageous exploits that  will send a shiver running down your backbone every time you come across  those parts. And an inexperienced young squirrel and his mole buddy as well  as a plucky young badger girl and her shrew allies very quickly gets caught  in the skin-chilling whirlwind as the great badger fiercelly strikes out at  his old enemies from the past. And I must warn you, you WILL get caught as  well!	2000-04-23

In fact, this is quite different from Jurassic Park - here, dinosaurs treat you with a great respect and  even speak to you in your own language! The details of everyday life in the  lovely Dinotopia are quite eye-filling and breathtaking, ranging from a  wooden puppet serving as a foster mother to new hatchlings to the simply  stunning ariel views of those glorious castles proudly standing upon very  craggy mountains as you fly by on a pterosaurus-shaped hang-guider! A  hardcore dinosaur lover would just swoon at those wonderful sights no  matter how old he or she is!	2000-04-20

With all that  mean-spirited gremlin-like timing in Ms. Takahashi's romantic slapstick  comedy, perhaps both Godai and Kyoko would be much better off if they just  forgot about each other altogether.<br /> But - in the very last book right  before the grand finale yet to come up, we personally witness the true  maturing of the young Godai from a drooling girl-crazy kid into a  solemn-faced, long-suffering hero with tenderness for small children and a  grim determination to succeed at everything, no matter what - to win the  affections of the pretty young Kyoko. But - on the other hand, however,  Kyoko herself, though a seemingly perfect, self-contained young woman on  the outside, she actually turns out to be a spitting hellcat when it comes  to sexual jealousy. All in all, it's a very engrossing trip that will  surely hold you fast until the very conclusion of the whole series finally  comes right off the press!	2000-04-18

So I tried  it and found it a bit wordy for my liking. But I read on anyway and I  became quite interested in the mythical world of Narnia, which is just like  Oz, only with fabulous creatures and beasts. And I had seen the children's  picture books featuring the noble lion, Aslan and the fearless children as  well as remembering the animated show I saw on the TV years ago - so right  now I am falling into love all over again! Now I just can't wait to re-read  the remarkable tale of bestiary as soon as I can get my hands on a copy!  One thing that really puzzles me, though - how come the very first book,  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is reprinted as the second book???!!	2000-04-18

Ben Holiday, a solemn lawyer who had lost his wife and daughter did the most unusual thing one day: buy a faroff fantasyland and become a king for it. And he did it all with a very straightforward mind as if he is still  back on Earth - he even went jogging through the enchanted forest near his  new palace! In addition, our hero befriended a whole cast of very  interesting fantasy characters like a comical wizard, a talking dog with  human hands, and a very luscious green-skinned forest nymph who could turn  into a tree and looks ready to throw her fabulous body at the stern-faced  lawyer who still misses his lost family. And what is more, our hero got  much more than he bargained for: a great mission to overthrow all the  enemies like the wizard's evil twin, a dragon, and a sorceress holding an  iron grip on the lovely little fairyland that he had inherited. A very  delightful, imaginative ride through the pretty place gently illuminated by  several colored moons!	2000-04-14

Cherryh  introduces you to a very alien, faroff reign of the whole universe where humans barely touch, let alone survive. So here the great space epic  unfolds when Tully, a lone survivor was fleeing the bloodthirsty  long-snouted Kifs and thus ran into the captain of a very noble lion-like  race, the red-golden Hani. Pyanfar, an arrogant but proud leader decides to  spare the human's life - and as a result, she and her loyal crew began to  run into even more trouble, worst than the last as they desperately fly  from star to star in a determined search for help. But despite the constant  betrayal, the poor treatment, and the cold brush-off from the other aliens,  the ever-gallant creatures grimly dug into their claws and held on fast  until they could at least see to the lone human's safety.<br /> This is a  whole new galaxy far more complex than you can ever imagine, with so many  languages, behavior, norms, etc. interacting with each other - a very  realistic vision of what would it be like to live in the very hub of an  intergalactic enterprise. One would wonder how Ms. Cherryh came up with  such alien-sounding names and all. And what is more, the whole world is  quite different from what we are already familiar with. For instance, the  Chanur crew are very muscular, sport mustaches and breads, and wear only  trousers below their bare-chested torsos, but they are actually FEMALES!  And what's more, humans are very scarce in this part of the boundless outer  space. So prepare yourself for the great oydessy into the unkown!	2000-04-13

When I first picked up this copy a few years back, I really got hooked on The Knight of Darkness! In fact, this is nothing like you have ever seen before in any superhero comic! It's really dark, brooding, and quite  sophisticated. Sexy as well! The story takes place many years into the  future, when Bruce Wayne was a white-haired retiree who still had the taste  for extreme danger. So when Half-and-half and Joker decided to make  trouble, Batman was forced to shake mothballs out of his old cape and draw  the scowling cowl over his face to strike once again in the cloak of night.  Enter a young junior high school girl who wants to help out and thus  contributed tremendously to the great ressuraction of the old Caped  Crusader. However, after a great ramage of bloody violence and destruction,  end for once and all still looms before the aging knight in black. Pretty  sad, but the bat guy still hangs in grimly, not ready to give up everything  forever. An very absorbing read that can give you a very jilting electric  shock as as each scene opens up dramatically before your inexperienced  eyes!	2000-04-13

In a slightly smaller format than the original paperback volumes, the Elfquest tales that occurred between the great espiodes of the elfin adventures on The World of Two Moons are all presented in full, glaring  colors that really blinds your eyes which are more accustomed to the  gentler tones of the colorized comic-book collections. Here you meet  Strongbow and his wolffriend, Kyavek and her winged boyfriend, Ember and  her coming-of-age discoveries, Tyleet and her foster kid, and Skywise and  his ill-fated parents. Personally, I feel that the gentle little Tyleet had  inherited her mother's child-hunger, so she had a chance to fulfill her  aching maternal instincts with an abandoned infant from a nearby human  camp. Pretty sappy, in my opinion. But all the Elfquest fans get to unlock  even more mysteries about their most favorite elfin characters as well as  color-saturated new stories to boot!	2000-04-08

This very artful fantasy saga first opens with a ghostly castle suddenly appearing right out of the sky to float down to a prehistoric world, where all the lordly elves in exile were forced to settle down to a crude  existence deep in the woods inhabited by their savage enemies, the  elf-hating cavepeople. As it happens, the human leader decides to set the  forest afire in order to get rid of all the strange, pointy-eared creatures  that ride on wild wolves. Thus it was quite a fatal move for both the  humans and the elves, who had to turn to the treacherous trolls for help,  like it or not. As a result, the unfortunate elves found themselves out in  the very midst of a very dry desert - and a whole new world to behold...and  the rest is history.  A very intriguing vision so skillfully handmade  by a very talented young woman and her equally talented husband - a very  rare find in the whole world of comic books and graphic novels. Gorgeous  flower-like art, excellent layout, and very interesting characters with  their multi-faceted personalities ranging from the fiercefully brave Cutter  to the sly, woman-chasing Skywise to the beautiful, sexy Leetah to the  giggly little blonde Newstar in a simple blue dress. In addition, since the  creative couple is unable to have any children of their own, they also had  the big opportunity to conjure up their personal parenting fantasy by  inventing the very concept of Recognization, a very spiritual process that  forces the elfin couples to fall into love with each other and after a  two-year gestation, produce an incredibly perfect child with a magical gift  of its own to benefit the entire elfin race. Very unique and imaginative.  Unfortunately, after only a few volumes, the very quality of the Elfquest  stories began to lose its touch due to the fact they had been turned over  to the other hands. Too many witches spoilt the brew, as the old saying  would have gone, I guess.	2000-04-08

Believe me, you just won't believe this! This is the most skillfully drawn and written part of the whole &quot;Elfquest&quot; series next to the part about the adventures in the Blue Mountain. In fact, you won't see anything  like this ever again in any Elfquest tales, nor even the future ones yet to  come, I suspect. The great epic of war against the bloodthirsty Trolls of  the Great White North begins right after the imprisonment of elves in the  Blue Mountain by the witchlike Winnowill - a real teeth-rattling clash of  so many different characters, old or new with their individual  personalities and differences. In additional, a whole galaxy of the  fantastic environment on the far-off World of Two Moons really opens up for  the very first time to your mortal human eyes - from the monstrous  labyrinth of the Troll lair to the shimmering walls of the long-lost Palace  of the High Ones - with a whole bagful of earth-shaking surprises to boot!

Some are quite artful and some are pretty dreadful and  not too accurate to the history of Elfquest. And you just won't believe the  Warner Bros.-style cartoon featuring Cutter, Leetah and Skywise with all  its ridculous visual gags and taunting references to the adventures of the  Elfquest!

It still looks good at first, however.    You may remember that back in the espiode of the Blue Mountain, the  unfortunate young Dewshine had been forced to mate with a genetically  misfigured bat-elf, so here she had produced and nurtured a very chubby  &quot;Windkin&quot; baby which had inherited a floating knack of its own.  So in this new espiode, one of the Guilders who had survived the &quot;Blue  Mountain&quot; incident had come sniffing around the Wolfrider's new  hideout in The Forbidden Grove. Unfortunately, Dewshine's kid had flown  right out to regard the intruder with some bubbly baby talk. As a result,  the Guilder had suddenly grabbed the infant and made right off with it as a  prize to present to the wicked Winnowill, who has by now made herself The  Queen of The Blue Mountain. So it's the Wolfriders to the rescue! A good  read, with all the characters sporting an appearance makeover, but not as  exsiquite as the original stories done by the hand of the original  creators.	2000-04-08

When I was a young teenager who was really into dinosaurs, I discovered this very curious and mysterious book all about dinosaurs in a local library near my home. It was oh, so lavishly illustrated by the reowned  fantasy artist, William Stout and this means it is simply NOT still another  scientific book on prehistoric life. Instead, it is a very intimate insight  into the lives of each of your most favorite dinosaur which reads just like  a very gothic novel-style tale that describes just about EVERYTHING from a  dinosaur's shudder at the very first nip of cold to its very last moaning  gasp right after it was killed in a battle. And boy, the art is NOTHING  like you've ever seen before!  In fact, the whole book is so lusciously  painted in the gothically fantastic style - that HUGE picture of the great,  hulking stegosaurus slowly drawing back to strike back at its toothy foe  just about BLEW my socks right off!

It is a very illustrative and eye-opening tale about an unhappy English teenager who took her beloved rat and fled the chambers of horror  which she would've called &quot;home&quot;, which was haunted by her  sexually abusive father and her haughty, unloving mother. After a whole  series of very scary misadventures with sexual predators and pursuing  policemen as well as begging for food and sharing a run-down room with a  cocky young boy who leads a helping hand, Helen finally decides to turn  around and face her worst enemy - who happens to be her own loving daddy.  And, Helen also finds a very powerful inspiration in her most favorite  author, Beatrix Potter - who probably had gone through the very same  situation in her youth. Very clever storytelling and such beautiful,  realistic artwork that truly glitters with a subtle element of fantasy and  action adventure, though I found Helen's encounter with her perverted dad a  bit too melodramatic and some of the characters depicted in the story are a  bit ugly to look at, like the girl's mother, who is wearing too much  make-up on her aging face. However, this is the very kind of creation I  wish I can find on more and more of the graphic novels and comic books  being produced today instead of just superheroes and oversexed young  bimbos.	2000-03-25

I truly love the brilliant use of idioms as gags (riding off on a nightmare, for instance) as well as the really hilarious scenes involving the gentle-natured orge and his  girlish-girly troop. And there are also simply beautiful images so  playfully painted to depict this very creative fantasy playground. (Hey, I  used to live in Xanth - the &quot;Tampa&quot; area, to be exact!) There's  one thing, however that totally turns me off. Some of the passages in this  books reads as if a hormone-crazed adolescent boy had written it during his  sexual fits. This attitude suggested a bit of good-humored predatory as  well as that repulsive &quot;love&quot; scene between the orge and the  little fairy maiden.

The handsome, rich and famous newspaper writer with his very characteristic walrus-like mustache winds up in his very first homoicide-related adventure and meets his charming four-legged sidekick as  well in this first book. Such a wonderful, richly-detailed story that  describes just about everything ever to happen to Mr. Qwilleran with a very  sharp eye for architecture styles and interior design as well as a truly  refined taste for recipes and cooking. Cat lovers will also relish in such  amusing and sometimes amazing antics of Koko, the all-knowing Siamese cat  and Yum Yum, his female counteract who will  be appearing in the later  books. In addition, a good deal of flightful fantasy is so deftly woven  into Qwill's rich, adventure-filled life as he and his beloved cats move  from one truly beautiful and exciting place to another, taking along with  him his most cherished longtime friends and meeting new faces as well while  many of the characters he came to know eventually got killed off in each  succeeding books. A truly glamourous ride for everyone who enjoys curling  up with a good mystery and a warm, purring pussycat!	2000-02-22

But she evidently paid quite a high price for molesting such  dangerous fabled creatures that can work evil magic on her as the text  eventually revealed. So as Lady Cottington grew up, she began to attract  alot of unwanted sexual advances and perhaps even rape from the most  unsavory men ever to creep into her innocent young life as all the fairies  all looked on and gloated merrily. And what is more, the unhappy victim  ended up living out her life in complete seclusion - an unfunny story that  has - quite ironically - a whole batch of bawdily funny pictures to go with  it.	2000-02-18

My sister and I grew up on Beverly Cleary's very imaginative and delightful books all about the whole gang of lively kids which my mother had introduced to me AND grew up on herself. Once a bratty little sister  clad in overalls, Ramona eventually matures into a very complex character  with her triumphs and woes and frustration and fulfillment and all! In  fact, this is the very adventureous and fun-loving young girl that April  Patterson, one of the characters from the comic strip, &quot;For Better or  For Worse&quot; had been imitating all along!	2000-02-18

Our lovesick, long-suffering hero, Godai winds up teaching at an all-girl high school where the object of his yearning desire once attended (and attached her first husband in the very first place). This heart-rending  irony continues when a lovestruck young student decides to chase the  handsome Godai all the way to the ends of the  world. In fact, this  stinking rotten little girl even denies her own self-respect and the  respect from others when she cornered her victim wearing only a bra, forced  her way into his room, manuipulated and abused her dear old father into  giving him a job at his company, and plain just drove poor young Koyoko  (and Godai as well) up the wall. The kid's dad seems like a gruffy,  heavy-breathing orge who looks ready to eat up any male who would dare to  go near his only daughter, - but actually, he turns out to be such a docile  piece of putty in the dainty hands of that mean little creature. A real  nice touch of Lolita-complex twist in the endless mating ritual between the  ever-hopeful young Godai and the lovely dark-eyed Koyoko.	2000-02-16

Still more bizarre adventures with the pretty young alien princess in those funky tiger stripes! And this time the whole gang goes off to spend a long, extragant holiday at the beach. Lots of crazy fun! However, there are  quite a few things in this manga book that makes me sorry that the  immensely talented creator happens to be a woman. For instance, there's  this one scene where a mysterious binkini snatcher forcibly rips a swimming  suit right off a female victim, leaving her in tears as the boys all laugh  and gawk at her naked body. I truly understand that Rumiko Takahashi is  living in a very male society, but this does border on gender problems.  However, other than that, I say hats off to one of the greatest manga  cartoonists ever lived for her very fertile imagination and her endless  supply of the most fabulous characters and creatures ever to grace her  pages!	2000-02-14

Those young folks all present a very insightful slice of their lives in such an amazing  diversity of cultures that will really open the eyes of a typical kid here  in America and everywhere else. Then he and she will learn that not all  kids come in a similar package and that &quot;the small world&quot; is not  really at all small in its great variety of human beings and their ways of  life.

There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it  doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very  creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes,  there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A  do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and  fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a  proper lady of the Victorian era.	2000-02-03

Rumiko Takahashi is a true genius and thus should be an inspirational to all female cartoonists, including myself. Here she spins out a lively drama in a slightly shabby little Tokyo residence shared by a whole cast of the  most colorful personalities ever to clash with each other. Right in the  very midst is a lonely young college student who suddenly falls for the  gorgeous new manager who had just assumed responsiblities in this bizarre  domestic circus. However, her tearful yearning for her late husband of so  few months prevents her from getting romantically involved with anyone  male. As for the young hero of this tale, it seems to me that he is more  inclined to &quot;spill his seeds&quot; on the innocently sexy young widow  than truly hoping for her to love him back. But overall, Maison Ikkoku  provides a very realistic picture of everyday life in faroff Japan.	2000-01-12

Welcome to the picture-perfect fantasyland inhabited by a pair of teensy-bopper Barbie dolls, one a goody-goody and  the other a wicked little wench. This is the very first book of an endless  series featuring weepy teen soap opera and hair-raising adventures that  includes sexual run-ins with Ken-type males, saving lives, kidnapping,  hostage-holding, crook-nabbing, motorcycle accidents, earthquakes, perhaps  even being stranded on a tropical paradise island, whatever you name it.

However, though I truly enjoy the humor, the drama, and the pathos in some of the plots presented over the years, all that schmaltzy preaching  about domestic life really gets to me at times and I sometimes pity the  poor long-suffering mother who has to put up with the endless difficulties  of being a good wife and a patient parent. And I'm sorry to say this, but I  don't have much liking for April, the family's young princess.	2000-01-05

I first came across this remarkable book in a local library and it took me through a grand tour of a mythical town inhabited by a peaceful harmony of both human beings and anthropomorphic animals alike and their own  adventures in such a wonderful utopian-like land. Then this idyll little  world would be suddenly shattered by the establishment of a air  pollution-spewing factory that would poison the sweet, clean air and sicken  the innocent children living nearby. So both humans and animals join forces  to protest the factory's ill-doing and then devise schemes to retard its  works and finally to destroy the entire factory although. A brave new saga  filled with flights of fancy, humorous snits, and the great love of  literature, rustic nature, and the value of a good home and strong  friendship especially between human and human-like animal characters,  though it may be a bit cartoonish and irrational in some parts. Overall,  quite a unique yet largely unknown work of literary with detailed  black-and-white pencil illustrations tossed in. And I'm now a proud owner  of this wonderful book to top it off!	2000-01-02

But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to  four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and  produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be  &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a  little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a  good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living  in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like  it nevertheless.	1999-12-28
US	50552724	R157PHPS8P1519	0835918858	412443617	ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C. (Globe Adapted Classics)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A truly enthralling view of American life in the Depression	Just like most of the other readers, I was required to read this book in high school about a decade ago. I still remember the vivid images this great piece of literary work painted of a farming family forced to move out  for a better chance at life - and thus fall short in the very end. It is  very, very descriptive - quite enough to give you the realistic illusion of  being there all the way back to the dolorous, down-trodden days of The  Great Depression and its ruthless, irrational injustice on the innocent,  undeserving Americans. In fact, the very idea of whole mountains of oranges  being doused with kersone to make them unedible simply because the prices  went overboard really did hit me. And it was also very hard to see  once-proud people being savagely reduced bit by bit to utterly Stone-Age  plight, where they simply stuggled on and on even after they all lost in  the very end. In short, though it can be a good way to introduce young  people to this kind of literature, it may not be recommanded for everyone.  For instance, it has a great deal of very repulvise parts, like a rabbit  being skinned and cooked over fire, a used-car salesman sporting an eyeless  socket, and the young mother who lost her infant finally baring her  milk-engorged breast to a hungry derelict in the very end. Not to mention  the very fact this ending still leaves you hanging.	1999-12-28

It takes a surge of real courage for a long-abused wife to get out of the lair of her monstrous husband who is brutal enough to kill his own unborn child without any remorse at all. That Norman creature would make you  shudder and shudder whenever you think of him! And Rosie really deserves a  credit for having the guts as well as brains to turn her life around - even  with the help of a magical painting.  There is a couple of minor slips in  the plot, however. The part where Rosie wanders nude into the fantastic  realm of the painting is a bit bogged down and the ending turned out to be  less than happy, when Rosie still has the feral instinct to kill her new  husband and daughter. Overall, it is quite an imaginative and thrilling  picture of a brave housewife fleeing her sadistic captor of a husband!	1999-12-23
