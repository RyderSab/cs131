At multiple points through the book I stopped and wondered, \\"Where's the story?\\" There was nothing there, unless you think it is big news that the REAL reason McDonald's puts playgrounds at their stores is to &lt;gasp> sell more food! Or if you think it is wrong for fast food restaurants to hire young, unskilled workers because they can pay them less. Or that the ability for restaurants to provide tasty, inexpensive food is somehow moving America in the wrong direction.<br /><br />While the history of fast food presented in the book was fairly interesting, the commentary was bland and unconvincing. The author yearns for the time when workers hadn't a care in the world, and everybody lived well; in other words, this book is nothing more than nostalgia for the imaginary. I recommend you skip it.	2005-07-01

This exercise alone will most likely be an eye opener for any business. The book then provides the necessary steps that must be taken to shift the location of a product on the quality/value curve. Managing Customer Value is still highly relevant and best of all it is not that difficult to put into practice.	2005-03-11

Death by Meeting clearly lays out the principles for holding effective meetings. Lencioni skillfully articulates key principles that WILL make a difference. Be forewarned, though; people generally will fall back into old habits without some consistent coaching and reminders.

Perhaps my expectations were just too high; but except for the first third of the book, it was rather slow and dull. And this is too bad, because I loved how things started. But once things slowed down, they kept slow. I'd say that the ending was anti-climactical, but there was no build-up so therefore no let-down. With that said, the book is probably worth the read because of its status in science fiction literature. It is also interesting to read how the future was envisioned decades ago.	2005-03-11

It is poorly written and jumps from very basic topics to some highly advanced topics that really only apply to professionals.

It is not typical Orson Scott Card -- don't expect Ender's Game. You are also far more likely to appreciate the book if you (1) have young children, and / or (2) are a Mormon (especially a liberal Mormon). The book will connect more deeply if either of these situations applies to you. Personally, I thought the book was great. (FYI -- I listened to the unabridged audio version. It was an excellent production and was read quite nicely.)	2005-03-10

I had been told that this was the better of the two books and I have to concur. It has a wonderful plot; complex enough to keep you guessing but not so complex that you can't put it all together at the end. Some of the annoying aspects of Brown's writing style were far less evident in Angels and Demons than were in the Da Vinci Code (e.g., things like \\"What he saw next he couldn't have imagined in his wildest dreams . . .\\")<br /><br />FYI -- I listened unabridged audio production of Angels and Demons.

The young men discover and read a number of foreign books (forbidden during the revolution), the contents of which captivate their thinking.<br />BLCS is beautifully written and has an evenly flowing prose. It gives a glimpse into the toils and struggles so many in history have had to endure. For the most part, I found reading it relaxing and enjoyable.<br />As a whole, though, I cannot give an enthusiastic recommendation. First, the plot wasn't overly gripping; while I finished it in two sittings, there was rarely a spot where it wouldn't have been easy to put it down. While the narrative contained some twists and turns, it was for the most part linear and often predictable. Ultimately, the story's conclusion left me unsatisfied.<br />I think a word of warning is also in order for those who are sensitive about mature themes. BLCS contains some crudeness and graphic imagery, as well as some explicit sensuality. Additionally, an important component of the plot deals in a matter-of-fact way with a subject that is divisive and many find offensive.	2003-08-01

The uncertainty that generally accompanies change provides a level of discomfort that some try to escape. Rather than take the necessary steps for change, some people cling to old notions and actions that produce little or no results.<br />These are good concepts to learn at an early age, as long as it is undertood that reducing such a simple little concept into practice is the hard part. Knowing that we need to \\"search around the maze for new cheese\\" doesn't help much, without guidelines for determining when we are \\"moving around the maze\\" or simply \\"sitting at the cheese station.\\"<br />Hopefully, parents can provide some insight where the book doesn't.	2003-06-20

It will give you a fantastic overview of what is available as far as platforms and tools for blogging. It is not a reference, and it omits a lot of things one may wish to do with their blog. But it will be helpful to the novice. While this is a beginner's book, it is not written at a &quot;Dummy&quot; level, and the typical computer user will be right at home. The only disadvantage of the book is that once you zero in on a particular blog management system (e.g., Blogger) the sections dealing with the other systems are no longer particularly useful.	2003-05-10

These are words that most college students should know. If you can master these in high school, you will be on the way to a rock solid vocabulary.<br />The format of the book is straight forward. After a very helpful chapter on tips for learning new vocabulary, the set of words is introduced in alphabetical order. Every ten words or so ends in a quick quiz. This allows you to test what you have learned; you can also start with the quiz to see what words you can skip over. The concluding chapters contain a lengthy final exam, the SAT and GRE hit parade (words you should have mastered well before taking these standardized tests), word roots, common usage errors, abbreviations, and some lists for the arts, science, finance, and foreign words.<br />This is a great book for anyone who would like to beef up on their vocabulary, or for those who would just like a good review to make sure they are not using some words wrongly.	2003-01-12

It is a great music resource to have around the home. Previously, I would hunt through the Hymn book looking for songs that were in the right range and that did not have too many sharps or flats. Having this book lets you play song after song of LDS music, all at the beginner level. If you can play an F# and a high E, you can play all of the songs in this book! (There is little in the way of instruction, and it assumes you know the basics of reading music and playing the recorder.)<br />The book is spiral bound, so it lays open easily. It has a brief introduction on some of the rhythmic patterns found in the book, and also contains a fingering chart. The songs are arranged with the most basic first, and an index is provided by song title. Most of the favorite hymns are included, as well as plenty of others. Of course, some of the songs lose a little in the translation into this simple arrangement, but most are right on.<br />The only downside of the book is that it contains a lot of unfamiliar material. While that gives plenty of material to work through, I suspect much will go unused.	2003-01-07

This is a great resource book for pyromaniacs who want to expand their horizons.<br />The highlight of this book is the chapter on the venerated potato cannon (a.k.a. spud gun). The author presents a simple yet effective design and gives detailed instructions on how to construct it. I have seen a number of designs on the web, and I prefer this for it parsimonious design. I have \\"launched\\" a number of spuds with this cannon, and am perfectly pleased with its operation.<br />Other projects include back porch rocketry (the paper match rocket, the hydro pump rocket, and the pneumatic missile), the Cincinnati fire kite, the Greek fire and the catapult, the tennis ball mortar, the flinger, Pnewton's petard, the dry cleaning bag balloon, the carbide cannon, and the ballistic pendulum.<br />The book is clearly written and illustrated (with drawings and black and white photographis). It contains a number of history vignettes along with some illustrations of ancient weapons. The remaining chapter includes some ideas for further study.<br />While I highly recommend this book, please note that some of these projects (most notably the potato gun) are illegal in some states. In that case, this book would be for \\"reference\\" only.	2003-01-07

I used this dictionary extensively while living in Finland for two years, and found it very useful. It is comprehensive enough to include just about anything you might want to look up, while at the same time very handy and compact. Don't expect this to be a travel guide, though. Because of the complexities of the Finnish language, you will not get far looking up individual words and piecing them together as you might an English sentence. To communicate, you will need a set of phrases you can choose from, or you will need to study Finnish grammar.	2003-01-03

This is a genuinely significant book for anyone who works in a team environment, whether at work, in sports, in the community, at home, etc. Of all the business books I have read on team building, \\"Five Dysfunctions\\" stands at the top of the pack. The strength of this book lies in the fact that it gets at the ROOTS of team failure. Anyone who has been forced to go through corporate \\"team building\\" sessions and sing with their fellow co-workers knows that it is an approach that doesn't work! The principles presented in \\"Five Dysfunctions\\" are solid and will get results.<br />The organization of \\"Five Dysfunctions\\" is as follows. The bulk of the book comprises of an extended fictitious example of a dysfunctional group, and slowly works through the underlying principles. These principles are then succinctly presented in the last few pages of the book, along with further analysis and suggestions on implementation. This organization allows the principles to slowly sink in through the book, but then gives the reader a very focused section the use for later reference and review.<br />A great strength of the book is that it avoids the all-too-frequent tendency of creating tension and then resolving it more quickly than would happen in real life. Reading the story gives you a sense of the effort needed to work through the dysfunctions of a team. The tools are presented to the reader, but without the illusion of a quick fix. Rather, \\"Five Dysfunctions\\" gives a simple message that inspires, energizes, and creates a vision of hope for how thing could be in a team.<br />One \\"a-ha\\" experience I had while reading this book is that some of the teams I have been on - teams where we all got along just fine - shared at least some of the five dysfunctions which made them less than effective. While these teams were quite accomplished at the superficial types of team building activities that are so popular, we avoided the core issues that Lencioni discusses in his book.<br />This book is one that I will review often, and recommend to anyone.one that I will review often, and recommend to anyone.	2002-12-26

It is an introductory text, but the first lesson introduces words like Lu3you2ju2 (the Tourist Bureau) that are not only difficult for the beginner to pronounce, but also aren't necessarily considered essential introductory vocabulary. Rather than teaching the language from the ground up, each chapter focuses on specific situations, such as \\"Welcome,\\" \\"Introduction,\\" \\"Looking for Someone,\\" \\"To the Post Office,\\" etc. While this may be handy as a language travel guide, it is not conducive to effective language acquisition.

The four concluding chapters cover grappling techniques, including holds, strangling holds, and armlock techniques.<br />Each technique has about 4 or 5 photographs clearly showing the progression of the move, and 3 to 4 additional photographs showing alternate variations or a counter to the move. What separates this book from the pack is the excellent textual detail that is included with each technique. The authors do a fantastic job of presenting the dynamics associated with proper execution of the throw. The numerous variations and counters included in this text will make it a Judo text with lasting value.	2002-12-21

Strengthening our Families is a collection of essays centering around the 1995 \\"Proclamation on the Family\\" by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). This book is targeted to the LDS audience, and thus many of the essays assume some familiarity with the teachings of the LDS church.<br />The eight sections of the book are: 1) The proclamation and gospel doctrine on marriage and family, 2) Marriage as the foundation of family life, 3) The sacred responsibilities of parents and extended family, 4) Proclamation principles for successful marriages and families, 5) Individuals and family life, 6) Understanding and overcoming adversity in family life, 7) Measures to maintain and strengthen marriages and families, and 8) The proclamation and the world.<br />Within these sections are numerous chapters and essays covering a wide range of topics such as preparing for marriage, intimacy, wholesome family recreation, moving forward after divorce, issues with family law, preventing and healing from abuse, dealing with illness and death, building and strengthening the family, and many others.<br />What impresses me the most about this book is its strength in presenting up-to-date scholarly research on families while at the same time providing an immense amount of practical guidance and suggestions. For example, there are chapters packed full of ideas on what can be done around different times of the year as family traditions; a chapter is devoted to ideas to make local church congregations more family friendly; another deals suggests ways to easy the burden of a heavy travel schedule for one of the spouses. It is a textbook and a how-to guide in one.<br />I have suggested this book to many friends and family. I give it a 5+!!	2002-12-13

For example, Montgomery states that a \\"Pareto chart does not automatically identify the most important defects, but rather only those that occur most frequently,\\" and then gives an example illustrating when this can be so. This is something that might have been overlooked if not pointed out to the reader.<br />While to book is rather current in introductory theory and practice, there are some relics from previous editions.

These are things we all nod our heads in agreement with . . . but then what? We are left without any guidelines for determining when we are \\"moving around the maze\\" or simply \\"sitting at the cheese station.\\"<br />Reading \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" is like signing up for the membership at the health club. It sure feels good, and it can be the start to something better, but the real work is yet to come. Read the book. Ponder its contents. But expect some discomfort if you really want to make progress.	2002-11-27
US	36367119	R1ZPEG8QC7SAE	0198602588	17940103	The Starter Oxford Chinese Dictionary	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Highly Recommended!!	As a \\"beginning\\" student of Chinese for a few years now, I have gone through a large number of Chinese language resources. This is one that I would unhesitatingly recommend to anyone.<br />The dictionary is at the right level for beginning students. The entries are limited to the most commonly used words. This is a major advantage for those who like to learn vocabulary by browsing a dictionary -- you are sure to be learning useful words (as opposed to specialty or infrequently used words). There have been only a few times where I have look for a word that wasn't included in this dictionary. I expect that the casual learner of Chinese will not outgrow this dictionary for at least a year or two.<br />I found the format of the dictionary extremely uncluttered and user friendly. In addition to the standard word and definition, entries also include very useful notes of clarification. For example, after the character for hui4 (\\"to be able to\\") there a note explaining that this character can also be pronounced as kuai4 with a different meaning.<br />Another resource I have been extremely pleased with and highly recommend is, \\"Chinese Character Flashcards 888.\\" Good luck in your studies!!	2002-11-27

Grisham has done a fantastic job of keeping the story light and simple, and at the same time entertaining and humorous. It is the perfect book to help get you through the stress of the holidays!	2002-11-07

In \\"Leadership Secrets of Colin Powell,\\" Oren Harari distills and expounds upon the leadership style of one of the most well respected leaders of our time. It is not a biography about or tribute to Powell, neither is it a book written by Powell. Rather, Harari has drawn from a wide range of sources such as personal communication with Powell, magazine articles, books, speeches, etc. The result is a powerfully motivating and thought-provoking book.<br />\\"Leadership Secrets\\" has 16 chapters divided into 3 main sections:<br />Section 1-Powell as Provocateur-jumps right in with \\"Know When to Piss People Off.\\" The other chapters in include \\"Promote a Clash of Ideas,\\" \\"The Ego Trap,\\" \\"Don't Go Looking for No,\\" \\"The Chief Dis-organizer,\\" and, \\"When to Challenge the Pros.\\"<br />Section 2-Powell on Strategy and Character-is milder but just as thought provoking with, \\"Close With the Enemy,\\" \\"People Over Plans,\\" \\"Vigilance in Detail,\\" \\"Situation Dictates Strategy,\\" \\"Powell's Rules for Picking People,\\" and, \\"Trust Those in the Trenches.\\"<br />Section 3-The Powell Character-dwells on some of the less concrete aspects of leadership with \\"The Powell Way,\\" \\"Optimism Is a Force Multiplier,\\" \\"Take Leave when You've Earned It,\\" and, \\"Prepare for Loneliness.\\"<br />The book moves along at a good pace. Harari does a nice job of presenting concepts without feeling the need to spell things out in excruciating detail. Each chapter is self-contained making the book easy to pick up and read in spurts. Finally, each chapter ends with a nice summary of the main concepts.<br />\\"Leadership Secrets\\" is certainly on the upper end of the bell curve of business and leadership books. I give it an unequivocal endorsement.	2002-11-04

Judo Techniques and Tactics provides the beginning Judo student a decent place to start. Pedro only reviews a few basic moves and throws, chokes and joint locks, and counters. They are moderately described in text and illustrated fairly well with photographs. This gives the beginner a good subset of techniques to work with and start to master. The book has a good overview of competition and some helpful tips on conditioning. Judo Techniques and Tactics should be useful for those in the sport less than a year.	2002-11-03

No matter what your political affiliation-Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green-this book will keep you entertained.<br />While Michael Moore can blow smoke with the best of them, he raises questions concerning some serious and disturbing issues, e.g., the 2000 election fiasco, the competency of our current president (\\"Dear George, are you able to read and write on an adult level?\\"), race issues, the sorry state of public education, pollution and waste, and many others.<br />Throughout the book, Moore consistently encourages and spells out the steps for the reader to get involved.

For those who are considering inventing for a living, this is a nice book to have. It is also useful for individuals in organizations who need to or would like to innovate. The book is a quick read and does not go into any subject area deeply, although it does provide a nice overview of inventing.

This is a great reference for anyone studying the New Testament. It contains various \\"charts\\" organized by 18 different subjects such as, Chronology, Jewish Cultural and Literary Background, Roman Administration, The Four Gospels, The Teachings of Jesus, Word Counts, Doctrine and Practice, The Apostolic Era, and many others. The charts come in many styles, ranging from bar graphs, to maps, to lists of scriptures. My only complaint is that some of the charts containing a lesser amount of information are stretched to one page, often by using an unusually large font. This detracts from the ascetics of the book, but the content is still excellent, nonetheless.	2002-11-01

I don't mind being stretched a bit (I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering), but the book was just way too over the top for any not intimately familiar with quantum physics.

It turns out to be one of the most disappointing business books I have read in a long time. Useem attempts to illustrate a number of concepts with detailed stories from history. The stories are often interesting and insightful; unfortunately, his commentary is chock full of meaningless platitudes and superficial analysis.<br />For example, Useem writes about U.N. Commander Romeo Dallaire's experience in Rowanda. Dalleire was sure of an approaching genocide, but could not convince his superiors of the impending tragedy, which ultimately occurred. While explicitly not blaming Dalleire for the tragedy, Useem give us this \\"Lesson in Leading Up\\": \\"When the risk is greatest to yourself and your organization, your only choice may be no choice at all. Steadfastly pursuing your mission in the face of personal danger and even organizational ignorance is sometimes both the sole course to be followed and the greatest service you can render.\\" If anyone is able to put this \\"Lesson\\" into practice at work, please let me know.

The book contains a number of chapters, covering the importance of a strong body core, warm-up, stretching, and cool-down exercises, training guidelines, and exercises categorized into trunk stabilization and balance exercises, ab fitness exercises, ab strength exercises, and ab power exercises. About half of the exercises can be performed anywhere, and the other half require equipment such as a TheraBall, ab bench, barbell, etc. Each exercise is accompanied by a photograph and the proper steps to performing the exercise. The book is balanced nicely with different sections on setting goals, muscle physiology, proper exercise guidelines, and the like.

The book is a quick read and gives some good pointers for those who are in management positions. A number of the tips are also valuable to non-management employees. The following chapters were nicely done: \\"The Customer Is the Real Boss\\" - A solid reminder of what our work is all about; \\"Don't Hire a Dog and Bark Yourself\\" - Don't do what your employees were hired to do; \\"Don't Check Expense Accounts\\" - The extra work and message this sends is not worth it. If an employee can't be trusted with an honest expense report, they should be fired; \\"Put the Policy Police on Probation\\" - Nice alliteration aside, this chapter reminds the bosses what every employee knows: there are too many meaningless policies that get in the way of work.<br />Although there were a number of gems in the book, many of the chapters lacked the depths and quality needed for a higher rating. The small size of the book should have enabled the author to do a better job at packing in useful information.	2002-10-28

This is an indispensable resource for learning Chinese characters. The flashcards are high quality and a perfect size that balances readability and portability.

The back of the card contains the pinyin pronunciation, the definition of the character, and a number of words that contain the character, along with each definition.<br />I have only one complaint with the flashcards. Because of a lack of space, the stroke orders are sometimes abbreviated, combining a few steps. It isnt always apparent which of the combined strokes should be written first. Stroke order aside, this is the best set of Chinese-language flashcards that I have come across.	2002-10-27

Okay, sure, if you didn't know that showing initiative and networking with people will help you be more productive, this book will clue you in. For those who happen to be more productive than a tree stump, you won't learn anything new.<br />Kelley consistently creates straw dogs that he easily knocks down with his \\"exhaustive\\" research. For example, Kelley states he wrote this book because of his \\"distress over the proliferation of misguided approaches to productivity improvement. Some are harmless (for example, if you take time each day to let your workers tell fables and stories to one another, they will be more productive). Others are just flat out wrong (for example, some racial groups have higher intelligence and are therefore destined to be more productive). With it solid research base, this book sets the record straight on what leads to higher productivity and what does not.\\" (p. xi) Spare us. When was the last time someone promoted \\"telling fables\\" or hiring certain racial groups as a way to boost productivity?<br />The most disturbing aspect of the book is the deliberate misuse of statistics. Throughout to book Kelley reminds us that \\"stars are made, not born,\\" that we can have staggering increases in our productivity, that we can become ten-for-one-ers. These claims are based on the research that compared productivity ratings that managers gave two groups of employees, one group that used the Star@Work approach, and the other that didn't. At the end of the eight-month period, those who used Star@Work had ratings that were about 10% higher than at the beginning of the period. In other words, if they were rated a 5 before, they were rated a 5.5 after. Those who didn't use Star@Work received ratings that were about 5% higher after the 8 months (i.e., from 5 to a 5.25). Since 10% divided by 5% equals 2, the Kelly claims that \\"you can double your rate of productivity increase.\\" When you realize the results aren't based on actual increases in productivity, it suddenly isn't very impressive. Oh, and the managers knew which group had taken the training.<br />Another eye-popping claim by Kelley is the potential 400% increase in productivity by women and minorities. But this is also lacking when it comes to the numbers. The group of women and minorities who applied Star@Work had the same 10% increase in productivity rating as the non-minority group. The reason the 400% number is used is because the minority group that didn't use Star@Work only increased their rating by about 2.5%. Thus, 10% divided by 2.5% = 400%. Ho hum.<br />I'd bet most of the excitement for this book stems from the false expectation that you are going to double your productivity by applying its principles. Most likely, you will be more productive if you skip reading the book and spend the extra time in the office.es in productivity, it suddenly isn't very impressive.

The first has the literary taste and texture of recycled cardboard, with platitudes as plentiful as the mosquitoes on your last camping trip. Then there are the \\"empty calorie\\" books, offering a fleeting sense of exhilaration--that is, until you actually stop to ponder how any of this feel-good nonsense is really going to make a difference in your day-to-day work experience. On occasion, one finds a book that is both pleasing to read and at the same time provides information that can be applied directly to improving one's work performance and enjoyment. Leadership and Self-Deception, by the Arbinger Institute, falls into this latter category.<br />Although targeted towards the business leader, L&SD explores a fundamental problem that is not necessarily limited to the world of the corporate jungle. The problem, which is both philosophically deep yet surprisingly simple, is self-deception. A founding principle of the book is that we are self-deceived when we have a problem, but don't know that we do, resulting in perceptions and actions that are damaging and counter-productive. L&SD clearly illustrates how we become self-deceived and, more importantly, how we can remove ourselves from this predicament.<br />L&SD is surprisingly fresh, insightful, and potentially rewarding for those who put the principles into practice. From the preface: \\"Our experience in teaching about self-deception and its solution is that people find this knowledge liberating. It sharpens vision, reduces feelings of conflict, enlivens the desire for teamwork, redoubles accountability, magnifies the capacity to achieve results, and deepens satisfaction and happiness.\\" This was precisely my experience with reading the book.	2002-10-24
