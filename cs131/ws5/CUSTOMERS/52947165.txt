The concepts of it, that is.  But, with greedy mutual fund companies soaking millions of dollars out of millions of pockets, it isn't the case, and it won't be the case in the future.  <br /> <br />I do agree that the far majority of mutual funds are not good.  <br /> <br />This book will be most helpful to folks who understand the basics of mutual funds already.  David Swenson has beaten the market consistently over the long-term.  This gives him credibility that many others in finance lack.  Also applicable is his lack of conflicting interests.  This said, I still read everything with extreme caution.  The Layman Effect.  <br /> <br />Today there are over 12,000 mutual funds.  Many cannot even beat the S & P 500.  David Swenson has beaten it for twenty years.  Swenson notes the mutual fund industry and its false advertising, hidden fees, and skewed statistics on past performance, which is often the primary pitch for present buyers.  <br /> <br />Some points Swenson noted was that mutual fund companies are accountable - surprise - to shareholders.  It's also a fact that funds with higher costs are highly correlated to poorer performance.  <br /> <br />Mutual funds run by managers charge high fees.  The Funds sold by stockbrokers charge even more.  Add managers buying and selling stocks at a rapid turnover, which runs up the fund's brokerage expenses, and cost to investors.   The median cost to investors in 2002 was 2.35 percent.  What is forgotten?  The upfront commission a broker may charge.  These costs significantly eat into investment returns.  <br /> <br />Sticking to the ole' fundamentals, the most important and easiest step, is to obtain info. and stats compared to a fund's index.  <br /> <br />Swenson's major point of advice is to invest through non-profit companies.  He mentions a well-known and consistent one.     <br /> <br />These funds that are non-profit companies that focus on index funds consistently beat out other funds.  This is obvious for tax reasons also, but Swenson also advises to put deferred (retirement) investments into these funds, allocating a particular percentage to U.S. stock, total international, real estate <br />and Treasury Bonds.   <br /> <br />Important to note is that Swenson has so much experience and knowledge that us \\"laymen\\" can just cover the basics of his advice, especially when looking at the ways to hedge, yet also gain.  The concept of \\"rebalancing\\" may make many laymen nervous.  <br /> <br />This book can help people.  With so many people in mutuals and 401Ks, people need all the help and education they can get.	2005-08-25

Wiggin noted the many positive to a weaker dollar in comparison to a stronger one.  He also gives us aspects of this weaker dollar that can benefit the investor, making this an appropriate and contemporary book.  He notes accurately that the greenback is not the mainstay, and explains why and what the potential ramifications will be.   <br /> <br />American fiscal actions and solvency are explained with some focus on the individual financial habits and psychology of the American consumer, whose spending on consumption propels 2/3 of the American economy.  American government and consumer debt is noted.    <br /> <br />As for the consumer, average per capita debt ratio is the highest in U.S. history, and home equity ownership is the lowest in U.S. history.  Wealth in residential real estate, propelled low interest rates, interest-only loans, significant speculation, and pop-flipping, Americans may well be in a state of denial about the strength of the U.S. economy and their personal economic situation: a high percentage of net worth allocated in residential real estate - the house they just happen to be living in.  All it will take is an economic hiccup.  And, if there is no hiccup, we have wages that are flat and even declining in comparison to housing values and increasing levels of taxation.    <br /> <br />There are many factors involved in valuation of currencies.   <br /> <br />As Wiggin notes the positives of a weaker dollar,  <br />Obviously, a weaker dollar benefits the U.S. economy as it's more interdependent upon our global economy.  A weaker dollar can stimulate the creation of jobs, as well as maintain them.  The American policy makers claim that want a strong dollar and promote and ostensibly proclaim a \\"strong dollar policy.\\"  This is not the case, as we all know. <br /> <br />But the question of the future may be: how low is good, and how low becomes bad?  <br /> <br />Worth noting is that currency reserves held by foreign countries in part, are positioned by confidence in a currency and an economy.  <br /> <br />The American economic engine may very well continue to plough along, with high debt ratios spurring longer work hours and most importantly, boosts in per capita worker efficiency.   <br /> <br />As of August, 2005, the dollar is actually strengthening a bit.  <br /> <br />Economists can explain the past, but they can't foretell the future, just like the rest of us.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-16

With a click of a mouse, that's it:  Mark Felt.<br /><br />Woodward was upped by the Vanity Fair article but the gist of \\"The Secret Man\\" had already been written and it was only a matter of time before it would have been released, as Felt is now 91 years old.<br /><br />This book further describes what I've always been interested in about the Woodward-Deep Throat connection, which proved to be so powerful in its historical and political consequences.  \\"The Secret Man\\" delves into the relationship, logistics, and ramifications of Bernstein & Woodward's relationship with Deep Throat that has piqued the interest of many scholars, bureaucrats, politicians, academics, and political and news junkies.  What makes the phenomenon of Deep Throat more fascinating is the number of wrong guesses of DeepthroaDeep Throat'sntity by historians, journalists, pundits, political scientists, and academics.  Thirty years of research and many extensive studies have been conducted to correctly identify Deep Throat.  Many fingers have been pointed at the wrong (living) person, adding more intrigue to the Deep Throat mystique.<br /><br />Interestingly, Mark Felt, had been caught as Deep Throat a couple of times - publicly - but for some reason it was missed.<br /><br />What is ironic is that on the infamous White House tapes, Nixon accurately pointed to Felt as Deep Throat using logic of the leaked information, and noting Felt's passing-up for the number one position in the FBI by Nixon loyalist Patrick Gray.<br /><br />In \\"The Secret Man\\" we get more pictures of the entire Deep Throat aura in its sophistication and \\"intelligence-like\\" orchestration: how Deep Throat communicated with Woodward in the first place.  Felt had experience in intelligence and covert operations and used many of its tactics.  Woodward adds more detail to his early morning meetings with Felt in the parking garage, and also expands upon his relationship with him in this book.<br /><br />Woodward also investigates and speculates on a motive for Deep Throat, which will interest those readers looking to further understand it.  However, the only person with the answer is Mr. Felt himself.  There are likely at least a couple motives involved in his decision to leak, be they personal, professional, and/or patriotic.  Should the quest for motives be so relevant?  What is relevant, are the criminal actions the Nixon administration and its thugs carried out.<br /><br />How sad it is today in 2005, that those blinded by ideology and political view-points would label Deep Throat negatively.  The opposite is true.  Nixon was the traitor, Felt was the honorable citizen doing what was his duty: uncovering criminal acts by those appointed by the public to follow and uphold the law.<br /><br />It's all we have.  Once journalism goes, the law goes.<br /><br />Woodward has always had his skeptics.  Being accused of improperly highlighting and falsifying information, and embellishing his secret relationship with Deep Throat, in order to propel his career and expand his name recognition at the time.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Secret Man\\" reminds us that public access to information that is objective serves as a crucial check of those in power.  Those in power are capable, and often do, abuse it.  For a republic to survive, journalists must reveal what is happening in government to the public.  In this book there are issues regarding Constitutional rights and a journalist's right to protect sources.

Books	5	31	33	N	N	It's Quite Possible	The 401K shortfall.    <br /> <br />Intro to the premise of \\"Prophecy.\\" <br /> <br />The traditional Old school, \\"3-legged stool\\" is long gone, but most Americans have not adapted to the new economic paradign.  <br />Obvious to anyone who hasn't spent the last 25 years in a cave is the transformation of the Defined Benefit retirement by the Powers that Be into a Defined Contribution plan:  DB ---> DC.   DB: this is the retirement vehicle for Americans that qualify for Government and Union pensions.  DC: the Defined Contribution plans that are the 401Ks, Keoghs, 403Bs, IRAs, etc. which the majority now, and more and more in the future, will participate in--completely oblivious to what a financial farce it has now become.   <br /> <br />\\"Prophecy\\" is intentionally nuanced into two parts.  The first part, tells of the coming crash and why Kiyosaki believes it will happen.  The second part, how to survive and prosper during this coming and sustaining event.  The first half of the book consists of the causes of this coming crash: the ERISA Act, it's consequences, and baby boomer demographics.  There are numerous factual points regarding mutual funds of which there are now over 12,000.  Facts about the numerous negatives regarding 401Ks, are worth a read for boomers who have the majority or significant portions of of their retirement allocated into them.  Not all may agree with Kiyosaki for sure, but a plethora of statistics reveal many problems that are not far away happening, as of 2005.   <br /> <br />Kiyosaki once again accurately gives the financial education in the U.S. public school system an \\"F,\\" and rightfully so.  He stresses the importance of \\"financial literacy\\" as more important than ever since the passage of the ERISA Act in 1979. <br /> <br />Here are just a few of the many examples: <br /> <br />CASHING OUT 401Ks <br />45% percent of American employees cashed out their 401K plans when leaving their company in the year, 2004.  This includes all age groups broken by 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50 year olds.    <br /> <br />Brokers and Mutual Fund Managers: <br />Who benefits from the 401K standard?  Brokers and Mutual fund managers.  Who is interviewed on popular investment and \\"money\\" television programs?  The directors and reps. of mutual funds that sponsor the very program that is providing this market investing information.  <br /> <br />INDEX FUNDS OUTSIDE OF 401Ks & IRAs: More Diversification Demagoguery. <br />I'll add my personal layman observation about the current state of Index funds in 2005 here because it's relevant to \\"Prophecy.\\"  Index funds, typically suited for non-tax-deferred \\"passive investors\\" who want the pay minimal taxes put money into these Index Funds.  But the way Index funds rate companies - Market Capitalization (dividing number of shares by their price) - is now being considered inaccurate by many, and now cash flow, sales, book value, and dividends are being used to more accurate rate companies. <br /> <br />Diversification: diversification in the market is for people who have no idea what they are doing.   <br /> <br />Prescription costs and medical care: where the 401K will be spent on. <br /> <br />Demographics: number of workers to senior citizen ratio.  <br /> <br /> <br />SECOND PART OF THE BOOK:  <br />The second part of this book is about how to build your \\"ark.\\" Your financial ark that will save you from the 401K crash or flood (selling).  Like Noah loading his animals onto his boat to survive the coming catastrophe while others do nothing, Kiyosaki advises us to build our own financial arks to survive the coming market dip due to a legally mandated oversupply of sellers in the market, with millions selling at the same time because they *have to be* by law. Kiyosaki claims this will start in the next eleven years, in 2016 (be there no law changes). <br /> <br />In further discussing financial arks, we again here what we've read in every book we've read by this author.  Pointing out the importance of the financial statement.  Assest and Liabilities, and having assets that provide income.  The importance of accounting.  A person's financial ark can compromise of different investments. This ark can be small, medium, or large.  For those pursuing a small ark - a \\"poor man's ark\\" - the advice is simple.  Work for a corporation:  Pay 15.5% into Social Security + Medicare, pay additional fed. & state income taxes, and contribute into a 401k plan.  However, Kiyosaki notes correctly that not everyone is suited for the B & I quadrants.  However, this book does lean toward advising those that have the personality and are capable into shift SOME of their abilities, efforts, and investments into these quadrants.  He even advises people who want to stay in the E quadrant stop reading near the second part of the book.   <br /> <br />Starting a business, being entrepreneurial, and investing in real estate is not for everyone, as everyone is different, and in a separate set of financial and lifestyle circumstances.    <br /> <br />Kitosaki advises buying 4 houses to ride through the market decline.  But with housing values frothy, and at all-time high in 2005, timing will be very important to avoid Negative Amortization, which means being upside down on a loan (mortgage) as of Summer 2005 in certain geographic locations of the Unites States.   <br /> <br />There are numerous quotes by Warren Buffet in this book, often placed to support a concept he's explaining or an anecdote he's telling--again.  <br /> <br />This book is a quick and simple read, and it's designed to be this way.  Yes, as with all of Kiyosaki's books there are anecdotes, simplicity, repetition, and lack of detail.  But if he did use more details, it would likely \\"dry up the book,\\" for the masses.  The individuals that comprise the masses can do their own homework into the details for awareness, using \\"prophecy\\"\\" as a motivator.  <br /> <br />WORTHY OF RESPECT IS THAT.... <br />Kiyosaki does providea Contrarian view to the establishment of Wall Street and the brokers and mutual fund managers, who claim all is well, and things will continue to be great--so give us your money and we'll invest it for a fee.  It will be interesting to see what, if anything happens in the next eleven years.  Credit to Kiyosaki for taking a road far less travelled and actually putting it onto paper, thereby immortalizing it.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-10

Bulls, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.  <br /> <br />OK, Mr. Gecko.  <br /> <br />2. It's OK to pay the taxes.  <br /> <br />Specifics on how to reduce and write them off? <br /> <br />3. Don't buy all at once.  <br /> <br />Dollar Cost Averaging  <br /> <br />4. Buy damaged stocks, not damaged companies.  <br /> <br />Buy value <br /> <br />5. Diversify to control risk  <br /> <br />Diversify, diversity, diversify - if you don't have a clue what you are investing in. <br /> <br />6. Do your stock homework.  <br /> <br />Sounds like a good idea. Or you can pay a venal discount broker.  <br /> <br />14. Expect, don't fear corrections.  <br /> <br />Just sell before the tank. <br /> <br />15. Don't forget bonds.  <br /> <br />As set allocation and diversify, diversify, diversify. <br /> <br />23. Beware of Wall Street hype.  <br /> <br />Agreed. <br /> <br />\\"Wall Street is the only place I know where people drive Rolls Royces and give money to people to invest who take the subway to work.\\"   --Warren Buffet. <br /> <br />An important piece of advice for me is to just 'cut the loser.' If something has been a dog for a sooooo long, sell it, and move on.  How many people just sit and look at a declining chart, and just do nothing?  Would you buy it now?  If not, then jettison the dog.  <br /> <br />Jim Cramer is entertaining.  In subject matter such as quarterly reports and balance sheets, his energy, enthusiasm, and eccentricity is needed and welcomed.  Otherwise, we might fall asleep. We need a good balance of a hype : substance ratio.  <br /> <br />\\"Confessions of a Street Addict,\\" was enthralling, and Cramer is one of those \\"experts,\\" who has proven himself being a top-end trader and extremely successful hedge fund manager.  This said, today is today and his picks for the future in the year 2000 were of companies that have collapsed: they are gone.  Don't even exist. <br /> <br />However, what I like in his latest book here, is that he bucks (a little) the safe, boring, and potentially lethal strategy of \\"buy and hold\\" (forever).  If a broker or trader is good, they don't buy and hold, they buy right,  sell right, and sit on growth right.  <br /> <br />This book is marketed with some \\"RA-RA\\" and toward people who want to learn how to calculate a P/E ratio.  He does advocate spending one hour a week studying each company that you hold stock in. However, this book is not for those who want to \\"learn\\" how to invest or pick stocks and mutual funds better.    It's interesting for those that are interested in the market, even if occasionally, as well as the people in it, and the stories behind it.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-05

It's uncommon for a journalist to write well.  In this latest he discusses and interlinks Globalization, Education, Outsourcing, Terrorism, Ecology, Economic Interdependence and Convergence, very well.  He uses his personal style and has passion about what he discussing.   <br /> <br />A concept Friedman refers to today is \\"Globalization 3.0.\\" It's a major concept in \\"The World is Flat,\\" and according to him, began in the year 2000.   <br /> <br />Some of the ten factors he claims led to the flattened (or interdependent and interconnected) world are:  <br /> <br />Fall of the Berlin wall, which allowed for information and communication that was previous not possible. Development of Internet Software. The Netscape browser.  Supply-chaining.  Outsourcing.  Out-shoring (moving entire factories/plants to foreign countries). The ability to basically work anywhere in the world with lap-tops, mobile phones, Wi-Fi, hand-help computers, etc. <br /> <br />Another realistic concept the author notes (in his opinion)is that 30 years ago it would be an advantage for a person to be a B+ student in Indiana rather than a genius in India.  Now, it's an advantage to be an genius in India instead of being a B+ student in Indiana, or anywhere in the world.  <br /> <br />I don't believe this is the case entirely.  But in fifteen years?  Possible, yes.  The author did claim that an Indian engineer for example, has the equal production efficiency of an American engineer, at a ratio of 1:1.  one-to-one is the exception to the rule, not the norm.  One of the most valuable commodities in the future (and now) are education and intellectual capital.  India and China have both.  And together they have....2+ billion people.  The brightest of which, areproactive and working very hard to learn, compete, and converge. <br />I don't consider China to be a friend of the U.S. and don't think it will ever be.  But I don't consider China to be an enemy either.  China is a nation of people in the last hundred years that creates nothing, but copies almost everything.    <br /> <br />I do believe the author when he states in general that 'almost everyone's job can be performed by someone cheaper, somewhere in the world.'  His example of Indian accounting firms being hired direct by U.S. companies, is one of many examples that we are seeing today. The example of Wal-mart vs. Costco is a sign of where America is today obviously, and where it will continue to go in the future.  Wall Street loves Wal-Mart labor practices.  Low wages and no health care benefits mean 2.8% more pre-tax profit for Wal-Mart compared to Costco.  This said and known, I do go to where prices are the cheapest, and that means I do go to Wal-Mart more often than not, so I can save.  <br /> <br />This book does give-off some subtly mild warnings about the coming competition from India and China in the near and far future.  Not negative but expressing the need for change and for us to be aware of the changes we are experiencing.  Adapt or die.  Friedman notes that American companies realize the world has already changed and work in this context every day, while the majority of public policy-makers have not come to understand this.   <br /> <br />Friedman does give some positive examples of outsourcing, which can be debated (i.e., Outsourcing 1,500 jobs to keep 300).  He also lists the negative consequences of outsourcing.  Many economists aren't sure if the premonition of the flattening world threatening America's economic situation is accurate.  This foreign competition may mean continued losses of our labor force. It may help our economic growth, be simply a new playing field, or may provide the impetus for America to gravitate towards different sectors.In the real complexity of our world, all of the above and more, are probably the ramifications of our new border-less world.    <br /> <br />On a side note, Microsoft is hiring more and more foreign employees from countries like India, at its own Redmond, WA, USA, headquarters.  These newly hired employees have the equivalent of Master's degrees from the most prestigious universities, overseas.  Microsoft is hiring these people. And these people....work for less pay and benefits.  The incentives are not stock options and job security.  The incentive is: getting an H1B visa and getting to legally work and live in the United States.  Who's in control?  The employee or the company?  <br />	2005-07-22

Regurgitating the same old clich-ridden acerbic \\"shock-style,\\" there is nothing new to gain (if there ever was), from this upper-class Connecticut leather-bound bag of wind lawyer that keeps trying to pitch \\"demagoguery cool\\" to the masses.  For those that agree with her viewpoints in general, they will like this book.  Those that disagree with her, will loathe it.  Those who attempt to be conscientious and learn about the world in which we live with objective facts, won't even bother to read this book, for it isn't targeted to them.  <br /> <br />Coulter has her target-market audience.  Earning $25,000 per speech on the circuit,  interviews on national TV, published columns and books, what she is doing works.  If something is working, an ideologue shouldn't tinker with it too much.  Don't fix a machine that isn't broken.  She cannot afford to.  Leave that to the artists, writers, and musicians, and actual public-policy makers.  They can change and explore new ideas and areas--political demagogues cannot.  They must stay the course, whether they are being sincere, redundant, or flat-out boring.  Keep the message simple, be shocking and controversial, and repeat the simple message over, and over, and over.  <br /> <br />The Outdated and Moribund \\"Conservative vs. Liberal\\" Mythical Boxing Match:  <br /> <br />As of 2005, Conservatism is basically dead, being pushed aside by the small but overwhelmingly powerful oligarchy of political and cultural Neo-conservatives.  Liberalism died about fifteen years ago, near the beginning of the 1990s, with Clinton killing classical liberalism off for a long time to come.  Yes, there are a few classical conservatives and classical liberals that remain as individuals, but politically they have both been reduced to irrelevancy, left to pine in the back pages of Op-Ed columns.   <br/> <br />So why the Conservative vs. Liberal histrionics from Coulter again?   <br /> <br />Because it works.  <br /> <br />It simplifies complex topics for the American public.  These two labels make it easier, and even possible for the mainstream masses to categorize phenomena that is occurring contemporary American society.  Keep the message simple.  Repeat the message over, and over, and over. <br /> <br />In this book Coulter again displays arrogance towards poorer nations of the world.    <br /> <br />We should remember she was fired from MSNBC for publicly insulting the president of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, in which she said, \\"No wonder you guys lost.\\"  A dubious statement, that cannot be considered a historical fact.  Yet another historical error, was when she stated on national public television that Canada sent troops to Vietnam--which Canada never did.  When hired as a Journalist to cover the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004 she referred to it as \\"Spawn of Satan convention in Boston.\\"   <br /> <br />Brilliant journalism.  <br /> <br />And one of her most infamous public statements that only fuels more fire for anti-Americanism when we need it least: \\"we should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity\\".  <br /> <br />Love her, or hate her, Ann Coulter will be around for a while.  Similar to the obnoxious \\"fabulous Sports babe,\\" Coulter learns everything she pontificates about from the daily newspaper--like the rest of us.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-21

A great read for the layman and the news junkie dilettante.  Lots of things are covered, but I do believe the title of the book is to get attention.  There is nothing 'freaky' about what is written about, and Levitt is certainly no 'rogue economist.' Levitt and Dubner could have added a chapter including provocative prose and correlation analysis on how to hype book titles for publishing, marketing, and getting your work on the top-rungs of the 'New York times' best-seller list. <br /> <br />There is nothing \\"freaky\\" about pontificating about drops in violent crime, Roe V. Wade, baby-naming patterns, drug dealing, parenting, online dating, and whether allowing citizens to carry guns resulted in lower crime rates. These are just a few of the many areas of American society that authors Levitt and Dubner ponder.  And curious pondering is what it is.  Asking questions, and the human urge to explain.  Nothing wrong with this.  Put 3 economists in a room, and you get six different answers, all supported by a barrage of carefully chosen \\"consistent yet contradictory\\" statistics to support their  arguments.  My rub aside, Levitt is a very well respected economist, having been awarded the \\"John Bates Clark medal\\" which is given to the best economist under forty years of age.  Stephen Levitt has his credentials.  <br /> <br />As for the book, one notion that grabbed me was the basic concept that we are all latently and explicitly aware of in our modern American society, and world.   <br /> <br />Motivation stems from the: bottom line.  <br /> <br />Obvious to most of us yes, but he applies the bottom line to a variety of phenomena in our society.  With the myriad of topics presented in this book, Levitt uses statistics to support his arguments, while at the same time informing readers of how similar data are often intentionally and inadvertently misused.  The authors then use - the data they've chosen - to support their explanations, while the dismiss those that disagree with their viewpoints.  <br /> <br />His \\"bottom-line,\\" so to speak, informs the readers of \\"Freakanomics\\" to become more aware of the effect of incentives, and the frequent lack of factual bases regarding conventional logic and thinking.  A good amount of correlation and regression analysis is presented by the authors, which makes their observations and opinions more interesting.  <br /> <br />An informative, well-written, quick read, that in the end should be taken....with a grain of salt.  A reader can go deep into the subjects covered in this book or choose to scratch the surface.  The topics and notions used in this book can be good for conversation and some debates, if one wants it to be.  This is a good book that can allow you to ask questions.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-21

Indeed they are, with Coulter, Malkin, Franken, Will, Limbaugh, Savage, Medved, and other pulpit-pundits enjoying a steady ramp-up in their careers, let's get Bernie Goldberg in the mix too!  [...]  Goldberg is well spoken and less vituperative than the above spin-doctors mentioned, and for this and the fact that \\"Bias\\" was a mature piece of work, \\"100 People Screwing Up America,\\" deserves a look.     [...]     As for Goldberg's Top 100 List, which of course is subjective, we have to wonder why such an endeavor would even take place.  Some of the luckily chosen for Goldberg's list are the likes of: Bill Moyers, Diane Sawyer, Courtney Love, Tim Robbins, Ted Kennedy, among others.     First and foremost, I don't give celebrities or pundits the deferential stature and influence that could allow them and/or their ideas to \\"screw up America.\\"  Unfortunately however, this is a concept for the American public and their lemming-like mentality.     I don't have a problem with Goldberg's list.  Many on it have always given me the impression that they are pseudo-know-it-alls who place themselves on a higher self-righteous plain than the functionally illiterate and materialistic working and middle-classes who do actually work for a living.      SOME OF HIS PICKS:    Noam Chomsky is #11.  I hold extreme contempt for ideology, but Chomsky does give us facts and thinking that the mainstream media and public schools intentionally ignore.     How can the innocuous Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Jimmy Carter be on this list?  The only thing Carter does is pound nails for low-income housing units, monitor foreign elections, and give an interview occasionally. Carter is off the radar but yet, according to Goldberg, he's on this mean, nasty, list.....of people....who are screwing up America.     Among the many non-sensical entries in his list are tennis legend Bjorn Borg (#23),Martin Yate (author of the Knock-em Dead job search books) (#51), 80's rapper Tone Loc (#63), Seattle Times puzzle editor Stephen Pratt (#67), Simon Le'bon of the 80's pop band Duran Duran (#67), Billy Mummy of the 60's TV show Lost in Space(#75), and co-star of the 70's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar Yvonne Elliman number 83.     The list and the people on it are not what is interesting to me.  What is interesting is how Tennis player Bjorn Borg, Captain and Tennille, rapper Ton Loc, and Seattle Times Puzzle editor Stephen Pratt got on the list.  Oh yeah, and that goes for Some Le'bon of the the 1980s band, Duran Duran.    Bernie?  Are you OK?	2005-07-21
US	52947165	RJAY2AC42993J	9812180745	219682308	Hun Sen: Strongman of Cambodia	Books	4	5	8	N	N	Hun's Buddy	\\"Hun Sen: Strongman of Cambodia,\\" examined the past and present personal, military, and political life of Hun Sen.  Written very simply, this book says a lot with few words.  The writing style made this a quick, yet informative read to the contemporary Cambodian neophyte.  <br /> <br />Because of the tender tone towards Hun Sen, a reader will contemplate the relationship (if any) that existed between the husband-and-wife authors and the subject of this biography.  The Mehtas claim that during several hours of personal interviews with Hun Sen and his wife Bun Rainy that Sen never once asked to preview what the author would write about him in his biography *before* publication.  I doubt this is true unless, 1. the author and Hun Sen made an agreement and/or 2. They were and still are, close friends and associates.  There is a sense of \\"buddy,\\" in this book.  There is not necessarily anything wrong with this if the authors would make note of it.  <br /> <br />Hun Sen is an intelligent individual who attained sensitive, sophisticated, and important posts within the government at a young age and in ascended quickly in a short period of time.  (We should be cognizant of the fact that there isn't a lot of competition when almost everyone else was murdered by the organization he served in, the Khmer Rouge.}     <br /> <br />Previous to his political career Sen commanded Khmer Rouge military men, where he was spotted early on as a capable, intelligent, and pragmatic individual.  This said, Hun Sen claims to be ignorant of the more than 1 million men, women, and children, who had their heads bashed in by wooden clubs and metal bars, by the organization he had dedicated and risked his life for.   <br /> <br />As for his political career: <br />The commonly held perception that Sen was a \\"puppet\\" of the Vietnamese can be considered by some to be an over-simplified and inaccurate generalization.  The authors did note the necessity of Vietnamese logistical support and aid in order for Sen to move to remove the Pol Pot regime.    <br /> <br />Many of the individuals and organizations involved in recent and present Cambodian politics are described in this book: UNTAC, FUNCINPEC, BLDP, and the CPP (Cambodian People's Party).  Hun Sen was and is shrewd and effectively utilizes a divide and conquer political strategy.   <br /> <br />As for the extremely rare and parsimonious sprinklings of negativity toward Sen, at least there is some generic listing of accusations and complaints directed toward Sen by his domestic and international critics and adversaries.  But the criticism by the author toward Sen never went deep enough to be considered a truly objective piece of work. <br /> <br />Interestingly, the author failed to mention Hun Sen's wife and her body guards pouring 5 liters of acid on a young women's head, disfiguring her for life.  Reason: he was cheating on her.  <br /> <br />\\"Aid\\" Organizations: <br />As more NGOs workers have flooded into Cambodia bringing their nihilistic lifestyles, millions of dollars in the name of \\"aid\\" and \\"help,\\" the rate of poverty has INCREASED in Cambodia.  So we must therefore ask, \\"where is the money going?\\"   <br /> <br />You fill in the blanks.   <br /> <br />NGOs and the UN are more exploitive than they are useful, as is the Cambodian government.  Put these two together, and you have a society that will always be the runt of the pack.  A socieety that will always be behind in almost every conceivable category imaginable.   <br /> <br />Sad, but true.  <br /> <br />This said, this is a book worthy of reading if you keep in mind of its slant.  A Cambo newbie can learn more about contemporary Cambodian politics and its players, the different factions, idiosyncrasies, and recent history of Cambodia.	2005-03-09

Individuals who don't have time to do--anything.  And one of the many things they don't have time for is--being healthy, or maintaining their health by exercising on a regular basis.  Perhaps the title should be: &quot;The slow-motion lifestyle revolution,&quot; not the &quot;slow-motion fitness revolution.&quot;  <br />There is plenty of helpful information to help people workout properly at home using dumbbells which can provide a full body workout.  Stretching, and even the medicine ball are thrown in.  Illustrations, a muscle directory, and directions of how to exercise with proper form are provided.  Cheating and poor form also noted in particular.  One piece of particularly helpful advice for example, is the one-legged standing calf-raise.  Zickerman doesn't recommend using the Smith Bar for standing calf raises because it compacts the spinal chord.  Good advice. <br />Zickerman is qualified and experienced and his approach has produced results for me that were very positive for a period of time.  The effect of eccentric or negative training, which is the slow movement of heavy weight, (on the way down) helps build endurance.  Over time however, the body adapts.  Going to maximum failure, which this program advocates does tap into the Central Nervous System (CNS), and this not appropriate for everyone.  <br />The ten second concentric and the 10 second eccentric movements are designed for people to achieve maximum failure as the author claims, in approximately twenty minutes, or a little more.<br />The assertion that this can burn fat, increase metabolism, and spur LBM growth is definitely pushing it for the other six days of the week has not been corroborated by valid research studies.   <br />There are several different workout programs: HST, Power/Rep. Range/ Shock, West-side, High Intensity Training (HIT), Pyramid training, AVT, and so on.  The power of 10 isone among many.  For neophytes and those who only want to only put in twenty minutes of effort during a full week, this will suffice.  But the results won't necessarily be sufficient.  For some it will work; others it won't. <br />The symptoms of an unhealthy lifestyle which is endemic today isn't solved by a particular workout program, because it is caused by a lack of time and commitment, which is the cause of the problem in the first place. <br />Reiterating the point and theme of this book is important because it's why it recommends what it does.  &quot;The Power of 10&quot; was written specifically to be marketed to Americans who don't have the time,  will, nor motivation to do what's necessary to achieve or maintain a healthy lifestyle.	2004-07-18

There is nothing more amusing than some wealthy person in business who thinks they have the answers and the remedies for the rest of us.  Written in the late 1980s, some of the attitudes presented towards hiring potential employees will become evident.  All in all, this is an easy and quick-read.    <br />I read &quot;Swim With The Sharks&quot; front-to-back, however each chapter concerns a different topic, so one does not have to read this book straight through from page 1 to the end. <br />One thing I found a bit quirky were the consistent references to allegedly &quot;successful&quot; collegiate and professional sports coaches.   I don't feel it's an appropriate analogy to commonly equate coaches with the situations outside of the sports world.  The sports culture is often not applicable to making a business deal, dealing with corporate culture, and/or avoiding mistakes with people socially.  The sports in itself is a microcosm of society, but a separate world within its own.  Time and time again I would chuckle to myself as I would read a quote made by Vince Lambardi, some NBA coach, or read a personal anecdote from the now disgraced coach Lou Holtz.  Having to read Yogi Berra's lobotomy-like quotes and philosophy was quite dull, and not very informative.   <br />Some helpful and practical information is the &quot;66 question customer profile,&quot; as well as the &quot;12P Competitor profile.&quot;  I liked his noting (book written 1988) of how people who usually don't have money go out and buy a brand new &quot;prestigious&quot; car that depreciates.  <br />Mackay also reminds us (or me atleast) of the importance of writing small yet important things down on paper and/or notepads.  <br />One of his tips on how to save time is to drive near the front of a grocery store you plan on shopping in.  Then look for how many people are in line.  If its too crowded don't go in.  Thanks Harvey.  You've changed my life with your insights. <br />He also tried to break an attempt by his employees to form a union, which he lost.  He openly stated how he conned very employee into thinking they were &quot;special&quot; and &quot;important&quot; with his one-to-one meetings with them.  It didn't work.  They didn't buy it. <br />He does understand (see &quot;Dig You Well Before Your Thirsty&quot;) the art of the schmooze in talking with celebrities such as O.J. and world figures such as Castro about things that they do, and interest them in their free time and NOT about what they do for work.  <br />All in all, useful things can be gleaned from &quot;Swim With The Sharks,&quot; and it's a very quick read.	2004-07-15

The information in the &quot;Abs Diet&quot; can be beneficial to beginners to nutrition, weight training, and cardio, but for those with the basics down, it likely contain information already known.  Here is a reiteration for the umpteenth time of the following:  The Glycemic Index (GI).  Avoid the starvation mode by eating small, balanced, and nutritious meals throughout the day to keep the metabolism up and running by eating approximately every 3 to 3.5 hours. Keep your body adequately hydrated.  Avoid sugars, fructose and corn syrups.  Really?  The basic theme of feed the muscle burn the fat, that has been regurgitated for years now.  <br />The only portion of this book that focuses on defining the abdominals and obliques is the last chapter.  So why the title?<br />This book is put forth by two authors with backgrounds in health and nutrition.  David Zinczenko is editor and chief of &quot;Men's Health&quot; magazine, which gives advice to the perrenially out-of-shape and uneducated, according to its own statistics on it market base readership.  The title &quot;Abs Diet: The Six Week Plan to flatten your stomach,&quot;  is another attempt to ride the recent health wave of out-of-shape Americans who are spending billions to obtain any information they can get their hands on regarding anything that is 1. &quot;healthy&quot; and 2. will make them look better. <br />For someone to shed the fat that covers their abdominals they need to very knowledgeable about their diet to a &quot;T&quot;  This takes lots of time, trial and error, and consideration, while simultaneously living a healthy lifestyle and maintaining a properly executed exercise regimen.  All these things mentioned, can NOT be done in a mere 6 weeks.  The title alone insinuates and perpetuates the myth of &quot;spot reduction&quot; when it comes to reducing body fat percentage.      <br />Those who seek instant gratification with little effort or long-term foresight will be the buyers of this book.

The often neglected concept of intergenerational account was well done in this book.  The facts, figures and demographical trends provided by authors Kotlikoff and Burns speak for themselves.  There is no debunking these statistics.  No denying them.  No, &quot;what iffing&quot; them. <br />However....there is socio-economic opportunity in America and generation X and Y will still be able to retire like previous generations if they are creative, frugal, invest wisely, plan ahead, and most importantly: Think OUTSIDE of the box.<br />Meaning, that working in the pre-information age traditional work environment will not nearly be enough.  Spending years accumulating a corporate pension (the 401K disaster) and/or a government pension, will not provide enough for one to stop working when one is older.  Other investments, and income streams will have to be realized, and should be acted upon in a person's 20s and thirties. <br />As for the theme of the &quot;Coming Generational Storm,&quot; most of generation X and Y are oblivious to what is happening, and what will happen.  The few that are aware will moan and complain but not really act.  I know many people who thought they would live the financial lifestyles of their baby boomer parents.  I see them finally realize their reality now, as my cohorts in their mid-thirties are wondering why all the over-time and dedication to their company got them fired, downsized, laid-off, or plateaued, leaving them with a battered 401k, that is so far behind that they won't ever financially catch up with the boomer Joneses.  My question is, why did they want to be like the boomers in the first place?  An entire generation is working for nothing.  At best, a 401K that places one's entire financial future on the market.<BR>  <BR>The information in &quot;The Coming Generational Storm&quot; has been available for over 30 years.  If there was a ever a motivation to deal with the situation, action would have been taken decades ago.  It's too late for that now.  Any legislation at the federal and state level would be putting a band-aid on a bullet wound, and this action would only take place for cosmetic political reasons.  Why?  Because the people in power have theirs.  <br />Baby Boomers lament and pine those on &quot;welfare.&quot;  Rightfully so.  But these very same people will be the biggest welfare blood-suckers in the history of the United States.  Medical technology extends their lives, and they will drain Medicare with prescription medication, hospital bills and convalescent centers, which extend a life that is honestly not even worth living.  Who's going to pay for it? Us.	2004-05-15
US	52947165	R3GO1F48CSA9SL	0425179613	495393406	It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Riveting	A riveting quick read, that can make a reader think.  <br />Before I read &quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; I knew virtually nothing about the sport of Cycling.  This sport is definitely one of the more physically grueling and mentally demanding.  Mainly because of the lengthy races, and the lengthy training time required to compete at the professional level. <br />A dedicated hard working athlete that trained relentlessly, Armstrong also had a genetic advantage, like most world champion athletes: he has enormously high levels of VO-2, which is the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the body from the lungs.  He also produces extremely low levels of Lactic Acid, which is the natural chemical in our body that causes a burning sensation in our muscles when we exert them strenuously (Spaghetti legs and burning, for example).  That is why when many of the world's top cyclists were burning out at the end of a race, Armstrong could charge up a long and steep hill to overtake them, or strategically sprint to the end.  <br />Some of the Cycling lingo a reader will learn: pulling, Peloton, sitting on someone's wheel, fricking, dafting, &quot;Give an inch, gain a friend,&quot; and &quot;bonking out.&quot;  <br />To train for events and stay in tip-top shape a cyclist has to obviously ride a lot.  6 hours straight, at times.  Getting run off of the road in Texas by a Ford F-250, crashing onto the pavement, and getting actually hit by cars happened to Armstrong several times.  I could relate to him tell how he shook his fist and middle-finger at a passing vehicle as he lay on the ground, gravel embedded in him, with his bike on top of him.  Crashes will happen, and one of the most dangerous parts of a race are the descents.  Racers go at high speeds, through hair-pin curves.  I slight error can mean serious injury, or even death, as one team member of Armstrong fractured the back of his skull and neck.<br />Cycling was significant but not exclusive part in this this book about Lance Armstrong's life.  He shared a lot about his private and personal beliefs, fears, tragedies and triumphs.  I liked the fact that this auto-biography didn't paint just the pretty pictures that most auto-bios do (after, these people are writing about themselves).  Armstrong often candidly provided the reader with interesting little things about him, as well as his thoughts and feeling about issues, both big and small.  This info. on the little stuff is what I am often most curious about.  Armstrong is a Gen Xer, and this is evident throughout the book.  Quoting from the movie &quot;Goodwill Hunting,&quot; Armstrong has a favorite quote from a dialog between Matt Damon and a Harvard preppy after they have an intellectual debate.  This quote means a lot to Armstrong, and he applies it to his life:  <br />&quot;You like apples?&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah, I like apples.&quot;<br />&quot;I just got her phone number.  How do you like them apples?&quot;<br />As for the sport the reader will learn the tactics, strategies, and politics of Cycling.  Like any popular and lucrative sport with many athletes participating and dedicated fans involved, there is hard-core and fierce, competition.  In Italy, some local fans were so unsettled with the fact that an American was beating their favorite son (Armstrong in the lead), they threw tacks onto the road hoping to pop Armstrong's tire.  In another incident, a person sprayed pepper spray into the Peloton (pack of racers), causing some riders not to be able to finish the race.<br />CANCER &amp; CHEMO:<BR>When he began to feel pain and have diminished energy he thought it was just another part of being sore from training and racing, because soreness and pain came with the extremely demanding physical training.  After going to the doctor he learns out of the blue that he has a terrible prognosis.  He is knocking at death's door.  The cancer had spread to his lungs and his brain.  24 years old.  A world-class athlete.  Facingdeath.  <br />Lance takes us through his fight and the reader will learn a lot about the disease, what it does, and what is used to fight it.  After he beat Cancer with a combination of foods and 4 cycles of Chemo therapy, he recovered, then returned to training.  The cancer and it's destructive effect made me cringe and Armstrong described the chemicals, methods, and side-effects of chemotherapy.  <BR>Caner: up close and personal.  What it does to your body.  How it kills.  How Chemo kills you, and how it kills cancer.  What is it like to look death in the face?  Everyday.  Most of us have not experienced this. <br />Another scary scenario was that when he was diagnosed with Cancer and was to begin treatment to save his life, his insurance company refused to pay.  He technically had no health insurance, even though he had had medical insurance (he was switching jobs and there was contractual &quot;fine print&quot;).  Only in America.  <BR>  <BR>After he beat the odds, he got back into Cycling:  Victories started to come again.  Armstrong eventually triumphed in the Tour De France, the most demanding of all Cycling competitions.  People had wrote him off as dead.  When he returned to Cycling, some previous sponsors would not even tough him.  They thought he was finished. <br />After Armstrong's success, funny, that the French media began spurring rumors and unfounded allegations that Armstrong was taking performance enhancers, without having any proof at all.  In fact, Armstrong was one of the very few Cyclists to live and train in France, which has the most comprehensive drug testing laws regarding athletes in all of Europe, while other riders trained elsewhere, avoided the possibility of random tests.  Yet, the French media had to start false rumors.   <br />Armstrong noted the suburban isolation of the &quot;soul-deadened&quot; alienation of the suburb, Plano, Texas.  Home to wealthy polo shirt wearing country-club members, yet Plano has one of the highest ratesof teen heroin addiction and teen suicide in the U.S. <br />&quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; will make you think....	2004-03-07

Try tapping into the minds, lives, and motivations of serial rapists.<br />The subject is not the most joyous nor enlightening but it is reality and many of the aspects of behavioral science is interesting.  And, this field is relevant because it covers this realistic aspect of our society.  There are many things to learn about in the general strategies behavioral scientists' use in \\"Obsession.\\"  Such commonly used terms in the media such as Modus Operandi (MO) and \\"signature\\" are defined, and explained, and real life examples are provided.  What do signatures tell us?  Why do these perpetrators leave them behind? Find out in this well-written and easy-to-read book, that does describe but doesn't not over-whelm you with the the gory details.<br />Behavioral Science is an interesting and solidly scientific field that compiles case histories, research and data, validity, psychological testing, and evidence collection.

The type of work he would do.  The kind of work schedule he keeps.  What industry  he likely worked in, and what hours he probably kept. He often accurately predicts the UnSub's sexual and criminal history, and the types of relationships the UnSub has with friends and lovers. When the Unknown Subject is eventually identified, apprehended, charged, and convicted, Douglas is regularly proven to be accurate.<br />This book is primary based upon one type of particular crime.<BR>However, it is written in an objective and professional manner based upon scientific evidence and expertise, case histories, and technological advancements used in this field.  Several criminal case histories are noted from all over the world.  <br />Serial criminals often exhibit the same symptoms all over the world, which transcend cultures, ethnicity, and geographical make-up.

His scholarly research is extensive, cross-referenced, and corroborated.  300 years after the death of Jesus Christ the religion of Christianity was still not set in stone.  There were competing sects, totally opposed to each other's beliefs, writings, and edicts.  There was considerable disagreement over whether 1) Jesus Christ was human but not divine, 2) divine but not human, and 3) human and divine at the same time.  There were also several additional beliefs within these spectrums.  Some of the early \\"Orthodox\\" sects actually believed that there were actually 2 to 12 gods in the Christian religion.     <br />Ehrman's research also proves (again) that many of the Christian sects that were considered \\"divergent\\" were actually the Orthodox sects themselves.  And, the elements of Christianity that are considered \\"Orthodox\\" today are the sects that actually altered the scriptures and basic tenets of the Christian religion.  <br />The author examines in detail 4 writings that were excluded from the New Testament.  One concept written about in \\"Lost Christianities\\" is the alleged \\"Secret Gospel of Mark.\\"  According to the eruditic and well-known scholar Morton Smith, there is a 17th or 18th Century  copy of a letter by Clement of Alexandria, dated from the 2nd Century that reveals the \\"secret gospel.\\"  Quotes from the \\"secret gospel\\" describe Jesus raising a man from the dead, and then initiating a homosexual encounter between the two of them.  As is common with many phenomenons, and alleged previously unknown \\"discoveries,\\" only blurry photographs remain of document, and the original is \\"thought\\" to be held in Israel.  Fact or fiction?  As is with all religions, it's hard to tell the different between the two.  Remember the Shroud of Turin?  That was a fake as well.  But the Christian church attempted to block any carbon-date testing of the Shroud.   <br />I was particularly interested in Constantine The Great's influence over the Christian religion.  His influence is felt today.  If Constantine had not converted while he reigned over the Byzantine Empire the Christian religion, and it's world-wide influence and basic tenet's, would be radically different today. <br />On Trinity: the concept of Trinity was finally decided upon by the Council of Nicea in 324 A.D. in Turkey.  The Council stipulated that there was a \\"Father, son, and holy spirit,\\" and this was the official line, or \\"belief\\" to be followed: Trinity.  Those who maintained the belief that Christianity was a monotheistic religion were killed and forced into exile.  This monotheistic sect of Christianity still survives today. <br />  All this decided, over 300 years after Jesus Christ died?  Will the \\"true\\" Christianity ever be known?  Have billions of people been practicing a false faith because of the alterations?  A faith that was altered by human politicians and bureaucrats three hundred years AFTER the death of Jesus?  How will Christians resolve this?  Will they mentally sweep this under the rug?  <br />After finishing this book those with objective and open minds will realize what religion is all about for the most part.  History, politics, public relations, and official lines propagated by the victors.  Those who were and are \\"believers\\" may have questions and be confused.  Those who are \\"blind followers\\" will simply make rationalizations, equivocations, and continue to have \\"faith.\\"	2003-12-28

Benjamin Franklin is also one of the most fascinating figures in American history.  A man with many talents in life.  Cerebral yet approachable.  A guy who would have a casual conversation with a stranger in a pub over a beer.  Isaacson also portrays this down-to-Earth man in a down-to-Earth style.  <br />I will steal one reader's words and paraphrase his statement that Benjamin Franklin started out as a \\"leather-aproned shopkeeper and ascended to be a man who dined with Kings.\\"   Walter Isaacson also correctly notes (in my opinion) that Franklin deserves to be credited with being an innovator and creator of the American political- psychological and political-socio-cultural framework of which it operates today (philosophically) as least as much, and even moreso than Jefferson.  <br />Though much of the contemporary recognition of Franklin is of his political doings, his innovations and successes as urban entrepreneur, business planner, scientist, inventor, writer,  publicist and diplomat are what have defined the life of this well-rounded man.<br />He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Treaty of Paris, (ending the Revolutionary War), and Constitution, our nation's most sacred and viable document.  Franklin was a genius and a man ahead of his time.  It's important to realize that if Franklin ever held public office in this day in age his marital and sexual history would have brought him down.  How interesting is that over 200 years ago there was more tolerance of certain aspects in regard to public figures' lives in American society.  <br />Visit his resting place in Philadelphia and throw a penny on his grave to pay homage to Franklin, as he said, \\"A penny saved is a penny earned.\\"	2003-12-10

More reality for the obese, over-weight, and health-weary American public.  There are no shenanigans here, just straight talk and common sense--that happen to work.<br />After all the workout videos, metabolic drinks, Hollywood diets, fitness-gurus-cum-salesmen, \\"don't eat before noon\\" diets, and \\"only eat peanut butter\\" mantras, we are once again hit with what we don't get hit with enough: common sense. <br />Eating several properly portioned and balanced nutritious meals over the course of the day will keep one's metabolism moving, provide energy, and improve and maintain mental and physical health.  We are also reminded of a very important factor in improving and maintaining our weight and health: The more muscle we have means our ability to burn calories increases.  More muscle speeds up our metabolism.  Eating smaller meals more frequently increases metabolism.  Our bodies are natural machines and focusing on metabolism is just as important as placing emphasis on what we put in our mouths (what we eat). <br />This book is not for the sedentary, lazy, beer guzzler, fast food addict, or office-worker who comes home to watch TV at night. <br />Worth noting is that Phillips does promote his supplements in the book and that's fair enough. If you're serious, get this book.  It has helped me in several areas of my life.	2003-12-07

Almost all of it is rambling prose and soliloquy.  Because there was never any explanation of the context, intent, or setting in these writings, one can not easily understand it nor get any inferred meaning out of it.  He could have noted the circumstances of the places and people that he was writing about.  Instead this was just slapped together, lumped it into one, and dumped on bookshelves.  A lot of his opinions come off as if he is on a self-righteous pedestal.  He also liked to frequently note, that this or that famous person he was writing about was &quot;a friend of mine.&quot;  In writing, once a person's name gets to a certain point he can convince a publisher to put out his work out no matter how awful onto the market, even if it is self-aggrandizing ramblings that no one can relate to nor benefit from.

US	52947165	R37MGKI4PLKDIG	0671795937	381852442	Rogue Warrior	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Rogue Welfare Warrior?	Richard Marcinko details his interesting career as a SEAL, which is mostly unknown to the civilian and military populace, explaining the tactics, missions, personalities, and the realities of the consequences of training and actual battle.  He then progresses through the bureaucratic organization of the Navy, as he learned the social rituals dictated by didactic protocol.  He performed the ritualistic and superficial \\"ticket-punching\\" that career officers must do in order to make themselves look more appealing on paper, thus receiving promotions.  He also notes the politics, \\"bureaucratize\\" jargon, power-tripping, dysfunction, and \\"pinky in the air\\" cocktail parties involving the upper echelon officer culture.  <br />Some personal anecdotes were very interesting and fun to read.  In one example, he drank the poison sacks of a Cobra in Cambodia at a Khmer dinner in Cambodia.  The Khmers were testing him.    <br />As this true story unfolds, we are confronted with a major commonality in society: in large bureaucracies people who don't \\"fit in,\\" or \\"play by the rules,\\" or conform to norms and protocols often are weeded out, made scapegoats, and/or have their career destroyed by an oligarchy of self-centered bureaucrats.  Such is the Navy.  Perhaps more bureaucratic and ritualistic, but not very much unlike any other public sector organization or private corporation as a whole.   <br />Marcinko noted the fraud and hypocrisy of many officers who actually applied for and received medals that they didn't deserve nor qualify for in battle, in an effort to help their bureaucratic career.  <br />An interesting phenomenon that the reader may come to realize is how much taxpayer money went into the training, travel expenses, and exercises carried out by Seal Team Six.  These training missions involved courage, were daring, and at times fatalities did occur during training.  Was all this worldwide travel training ever put into use?  Perhaps.  Of course, a lot of what they due isclassified.  <br />In the end some members of Seal Team Six were court-martialed and convicted for filling out false expense reports and pocketing the money.  Marcinko himself went to federal prison for related activities.  He did not go into details over this, which the reader will notice.  It also leads to suspicion that the allegations were true or partially true.  Since the Navy is good at railroading its own, we'll really never know.  <br />What I respected and liked about Marcinko was that he was willing to do anything that he asked his men to do.  He began as an enlisted man and often challenged the officers and upper echelons of the organization by telling to to \\"stick it\\" in more ways that one when he felt it was necessary to say and do so.  <br />The book ends in a surprising way.  Without many of the details told, it leave the circumstances enigmatic, and also sets the reader up for the following book by Marcinko.  Fair enough.  Read this, then check out his next.	2003-11-27

The financial decline of the middle class families began 30 years ago and continues to this day.  So why are they only people that are proposing solutions to this decline academics who do quantitative and qualitative (case study) research, and then propose public policy societal solutions?  <br />Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Tyagi have the experience and are appropriate authorities on this phenomenon.  They identify the primary reasons of it: fixed expenses. Those expenses which are constant and &quot;come in every month&quot; has increased substantially in the last 3 decades.  <br />Remember in the 1980s when the acronym word &quot;DINK&quot; was in vogue?  Double Income No Kids.  It may have sounded hip then but DINKS earn less today than one person earned thirty years ago, in 1973.   <BR>It is a commonly known fact that middle class two-income earning families have been and still are losing economic ground.  And they will continue to lose ground.  Warren and Tyagi correctly argue with ample and valid evidence that it's not spending sprees, lavish vacations, or luxury items that are doing it. It's the necessities stupid.  Property values supported with gargantuan mortgages are pushing debt ratios beyond the 38% considered the maximum safe and acceptable limit.  Housing prices have outpaced wages significantly.  Insurance premiums are constant and steady expenses that take a higher percentage of income today than in previous years and they too, are necessities.  Education costs have risen dramatically more than wages.  What's the American solution?  Simply to borrow more money to pay for the higher tuition.  Taxes have risen to mammoth proportions and take major chunks out of hard working families hard earned paychecks (taxation is not an issue delved into by the authors.)  Again, the killer is the fixed expenses classified as &quot;necessities.&quot;  Both incomes today are significantly committed to necessities, such as mortgage and car payments, health care costs, insurance premiums, and children's and adult's education costs.<br />The authors provide many practical and proven ways to assist folks in these situations (i.e., the &quot;financial fire drill&quot;).  But the solution provided by the authors, who are experts in this field and are renown for their work is:  public policy changes.  Public policy changes take place when collective and coordinated societal &quot;thinking&quot; changes.  Is this likely to happen?  If the economic situation has been allowed to get to the point that it has gotten to now, then why would change finally be implemented now?  Citizens didn't pay attention.  Policy-makers (who are citizens) didn't pay attention.  Most are still don't pay attention.  Now a couple of academics are examining the origins and and growth of this problem and offering remedies for it.  Few will understand and act accordingly.  The masses will simply keep struggling and asking &quot;why?&quot;  <br />We know what the dilemma is and we know some of the solutions that can help resolve it, but will these proposed solutions ever take place?	2003-10-22

Before it became a buzzword fad?  Before it became a label, oversimplified and over-generalized marketing term?  Unwittingly and not by choice, from Douglas Coupland, who authored this unique book, which was written and published in 1991.  The chapters of this book say a lot about the theme and the mentality of the characters in &quot;Generation X.&quot;  Here are some of the chapter titles: I Am Not a Target Market, Dead at 30 Buried at 70, Shopping Is Not Creating, Purchased Experiences Don't Count, Define Normal, MTV Not Bullets, Quit Your Job, Our Parents Had More.  <br />There is an &quot;individualist&quot; tract in this book within the confines of the circumstances that this cohort (age group) is culturally and economically confronted with.  How does this cohort (age group) accept, reject, or redefine its values living under this paradigm and these circumstances? Conditions which will continue throughout their lifetimes?<br />Sometimes latent consternation and cynicism appears between the lines with these characters more than they are presented in an explicit way.  But I don't think it is &quot;angst&quot; or &quot;angst of a new generation&quot; because that concept is another marketing term, and can be applied to the previous generations of the 1960s, 1920s, and throughout the annals of history.  Who created that (marketing) angst label, I don't know.  But people who use it have been reading, and definitely WRITING too many of the modern-day pop rags like &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; and watching too much T.V.<br />In the dialog and story the characters display some form of cross generational material envy, but they don't always project a complete rejection of materialism in this book.  However, I don't see sour grapes either.  Make sense?  Like many others, I added too many outside influences of my own perceptions and experiences into this book.  This is a story.  Characters.  Their stories, their lives and philosophies, are in this book.  It's not about a generation, but I believe it is about a particular sub-culture that exists within a generation.  To stereotype millions of people born over a several year period and pigeon-hole them into what they allegedly think, buy, feel, like and dislike is to paint with too broad of brush.  <BR>Coupland never intended to do this, but those who absconded with his title for this book, certainly did.<br />For those of us who read &quot;Gen X&quot; years after it was released in 1991, our minds have already been diluted and our thoughts and perceptions have been influenced by the progression of the 1990s decade and the media representations of it.  Today in 2003, with the massive exporting of American jobs overseas, higher rates of taxation, declining wages, high job turnover, and increasingly longer work-weeks, this book can reflect today, and it can reflect other generations.  There are many of this book's characters in our world today--and they are in their 40s and 50s now.  Their physical circumstances are the same, but their mentality is different.  Their minds have already been molded. <br />For a person to be an individual who chooses to live their own life  (rare today in America) they don't have to reject mainstream society nor the major cultural norms of it.  They simply have to embrace what they like, believe in, and want in their lives and do it.  Often, people think that real-life folks who live like the characters in this book are &quot;rejectionists&quot; in some form when in fact they are not.  They are simply living the way they want to.  And, in the instance of this book the characters' lives follow along a different path that most people follow.  Everyone's interpretation is different. But Copeland and these characters reflect a setting and environment, that includes the mentality and actions of a lot of people, and not just those of the Gen Xers, when he wrote this 12 years ago.  A lot of the latter Boomers (b. 1950 or later) are experiencing similar phenomena as Dag, Andrew, Claire and Tyler.  <BR> <BR>Written in 1991 it's just as relevant today in 2003, because the economic fundamentals are still the same, minus the brief interruption of the short lived techie and dot.bomb boom.  A temporary bubble that made a lot of people think that things were going OK, or even getting better.  Well, things are still progressing as they were when this was written.  <br />There are many definitions to terms at the bottom of the pages of this book.  There are many great ones.  Here are a few:<br />Air family: Describes the false sense of community experienced among co-workers in an office environment (page 127).<br />Yuppie Wannabees: An X generation subgroup that believes the myth of a yuppie life-style being both satisfying and viable. Tend to be highly in debt, involved in some form of substance abuse....(page 104).<br />Ozmosis: The inability of one's job to live up to on'e self-image (page 30).<br />Brazilification: The widening gulf between the right and the poor and the accompanying disappearance of the middle class (page 13). <br />Expatriate Slopsism: When arriving in a foreign travel destination one had hoped was undiscovered, only to find many people just like oneself (are there); the peeved refusal to talk to said people because they have ruined one's elitist travel fantasy (page 200).<br />Tele-parabilizing: Morals used in everyday life that derive from TV sitcom plots: &quot;That's just like the episode where Jan lost her glasses!&quot; (page 138).	2003-10-21

Removing the ubiquitous and annoying eyesores that insult us we traverse our nation on it's interstates, state highways and small roads.  One stream of these particular billboards exist.  It's so puerile and degrading to have to bear the brunt of these billboards, miles upon miles, for the sake of selling artificial knick-knacks in tourist-trappy drug store.     <br />In the \\"Monkey Wrench Gang\\" there are vivid depictions of Hayduke surveillancing, planning, and implementing acts of sabotage to the giant Earth-moving machines.  Ending with the grand finale at the notorious damn.  A damn in which even the people who planned and constructed it concede that it was a terrible mistake, today.   <br />Abbey is a solitary element of freedom while barreling down the the road through the deserts of the Southwest drinking cold beers with nothing but the yellow sun, blue sky, and mountainous etchings of the horizon in the distance.<br />For all his relevant yet didactic beliefs Hayduke often littered,  throwing beer cans out of his jeep onto the side of the road with glee.  I never understood what the meaning of this was....there is some hypocrisy and condescension here and there with him....but then again, isn't this the case in life?  Times are different now from the days when \\"Monkey Wrench\\" was released.  Today, there is common and accepted hypocrisy when people claim to be a member of \\"environmentalist\\" organizations that are heavily funded by special interests, run by indoor-types who make careers out of it, and lobby within, not outside the system. <br />As for the \\"Monkey Wrench Gang\\" there is a significant but not entirely explicit naturist, environmentalist, and political bent of these movements of today.  There is a piece ofmost of us in the book.  Especially as U.S. population growth propels the expansion of suburban encroachment, from Virgina to Florida, to the South and West.  Hayduke is someone of the Southwest who witnesses the defeat of natural beauty in the name of \\"development.\\"  Accommodation for people, their growing population, and their movements.  The first-hand and methodical destruction of what once was beautiful, to the sullen conformity and ugliness of suburban sprawl.  It's happening today as the U.S. population continues to grow so rapidly and unnecessarily.  <br />As in Southern California and other populated areas of the country, too many people ruin the lifestyle and opportunities in a place, so many then leave en-masse to live somewhere that isn't ruined or spoiled--yet.  <br />(Human nature, perhaps....)<br />If this isn't an example of people .... in one's own nest, and then moving on to destroy a new place, what is?	2003-09-05

This lends credence because in this field academics and researchers conduct sound studies, collect data, obtain objective results and then: tell folks to apply them in the work setting (real world).  Often, the results of this research cannot be applied in practice.  Hypothetical thinking with &quot;all other things equal&quot; as a paradigm often is not tested, and can't be.  This book focused on research from applied situations in the field, and therefore can be relevant to what people are experience in the actual work setting.  <br />One point in the book to paraphrase, is that the most important resource a company has is its' HR capital.<br />Another point made to paraphrase is that people (individuals) have set personality traits and fitting them properly with their roles is more sensical and productive than attempting to alter or &quot;change&quot; a person.  This is applicable to focusing on the fitting of strengths instead of trying to improve weaknesses.<br />More organizational and social psychology would be helpful for business, management studies, and MBA programs.  MBA programs turn out the worst business minds we have.	2003-08-12

Feeding the fix.  In addition to oil, Washington nor the west in general wants to see what would likely replace the current corrupt and venal royal ruling family in the KSA.  The Kingdom has been simmering with dissatisfaction for over 15 years.  With the burgeoning birth rate, and the once impervious cultural dike revealing some cracks resulting from global economic interdependence, the next basket-case of the world in the near future will be Saudi Arabia.   <br />The U.S. royal Saudi relationship goes back decades with the black gold, regional geo-politics, and sites of Mecca and Medina, which elevate KSA's status above a well-deserved butt-kicking.  There are so many powerfully vested American interests in Saudi that the kingdom is safe from American reactions, no matter what they do.  Saudi Arabia knows it, America knows it.	2003-07-23

It is a superbly researched and well written account of individuals that used fundamentalism as a vehicle to commit horrific acts.  Applying theological radicalism to influence an easily warped mind.  Fundamentalism is just another vehicle as is extreme nationalism, racism, political fanaticism, the occult, or blind totalitarian allegiance.  John Krakauer is a brilliant writer, and he's conducted excellent research on this story which occurred in the mid 1980s.<BR>I do suspect many minions of the Mormon church will be out to do damage control.  For the image of church, it's political influence and mass-marketed reputation, is paramount to literally anything else. <br />The religion of Mormonism has long been riddled with cover-ups, controversy, historical revisionism, and violence.  It's leading founder, Joseph Smith was convicted of fraud before he claimed to be the prophet.  It has has been factually established that he practiced folk magic (The Salamander Letter), which weakens his flawed reputation as well as his dubious intentions.  He also had a sexual affair with a married woman.  When his wife found out and confronted him he claimed that \\"God had revealed to him that he may have more than one wife.\\"  Hmm....how convenient....Some locals back east took metal plates and welded holes into them in the form of shapes:  squares, circles, and rectangles.  These men buried them.  Then they \\"started digging,\\" found them (again) and called Joseph Smith to come and see if he could make any sense of it.  Smith claimed they were sent from the stars and he actually translated them to people.  This is one true account of many about this con artist cum-spiritual leader.  <BR>  <BR>Ever since it's founding, there it's been engaged in historical revisionism and out-right white-washing.  Altering, changing, and even erasing significant elements from its' history all-together to gain the public support and promote it's marketing campaign.  A religion founded on racist principles: people of color--all color--are considered to be of \\"mud,\\" and less human.<br />Kudos to Krakauer for going where many an-author avoids going for fear of retaliation by a well-financed corporate machine such is the Mormon church.  The many Joseph Goebbels of its' pubic relations department are scheming right now to squash him.  Unfortunately for the chuch leaders, the truth usually prevails.	2003-07-20

Does attending and completing a university undergraduate program, and/or obtaining advanced degrees mean a person knows more about public policy, culture, international relations, or politics?  Of course not.  Not at all.  I believe &quot;life educations, experience education, social education, travel education&quot; is by far more relevant for personal growth and perception.  In fact the classroom often is detrimental to a 'political' education.  Each individual can go out and live, travel, speak, listen, read, and experience and then progress toward their own political and social identity, no matter what it may be.<br />Many actors (not all) live in the high hills of Hollywood, or on the Malibu cliffs of the Pacific, living off of their creativity and hard work in the entertainment industry.  And, deservedly so.  Does that mean they are qualified to speak to millions of Americans via the media and tell us what is right, moral, and just?  Who do these arrogant clowns think they are.  If anything they should be humble.  <br />Martin Sheen publicly proclaimed Malibu to be a &quot;refuge for the homeless&quot; to come and live.  OK....so....they will come to Malibu and sleep on the EDGE of his property.  Will Martin Sheen feed them daily, or have his servants feed them.  Will he let them in his house to stay?  Will Mr. Sheen purchase land and start building homeless shelters and low-income shelters in his backyard?  Martin....where have you been?  You haven't done anything but spew your self-righteous superiority while doing NOTHING but TALK.  <br />Elitist multi-millionaire exclusive club members can claim to be &quot;liberal, leftist&quot; or anythin.  With their financial conditions they can claim anything they want.  They can say anything they want.  And they don't have to do anything theydon't want to do.  Activist leftists should literally whack their head off for such hypocrisy.	2003-07-17

She is not obscured like many others by being a party supporter or ideologue that turns a blind eye to corruption and deceit, if it is propagated by and benefits, a particular slant.  <br />\\"Pigs at the Trough\\" is an interesting portrayal, albeit by someone who lavishly imbibed at the black-tie Washington parties of the past.  The guest list.  Being seen.  Oh, being a part of it.  Now it's time to point fingers.  There are tons of examples at which to point fingers.  That's fine.  Her archived articles are written from what is almost extinct when it comes to foreign policy and public policy articles: individualism.  Huffington does a very fine job of making light of all of the hypocrisy that exists.  She is not blinded by the pseudo-ideologies of so-called Conservatives and Liberals who are both blind to their narrow yet nuanced and intransigent positions of self-interest today, regarding the formulation and implementation of domestic and foreign public policy.<br />Her interests vary widely and she has written other books. She authored her first book in 1974, which described the changing role of women in society.  Then she produced a book about Greek power and myths in the early 1980s, as well as a biography of Picasso in 1988 which became quite popular.  Huffington adds a variety of knowledge and past experience prior to her writing of political books.  She is well-rounded.  Her tenth book, \\"Fanatics and Fools\\" will be released next.  There are plenty of fanatics and fools inside the beltway.   <br />She's the Gadfly that the power minions wish would go away.  Thankfully, she'll keep at it.

Using the sport and game<BR>of golf as the foundation to add insights and discuss the Presidents who played it.  Author Van Natta Jr. brought forth an original avenue to bring a topic that is commonly written about (presidents) to light.  Golf, the ever-increasing mainstream sport to the American public, is no longer stereotyped  (falsely) that it's an elitist sport to play.  In &quot;First Off The Tee,&quot; there are many interesting facts about the habits of some of the commanders-in-chiefs that hit the greens.<br />Bill Clinton took so many mulligan's the author called<BR>them &quot;Billigans.&quot;  He scored himself in the low 80s, similar to his idol JFK, but he literally took over 200 swings.  Clinton played loosely with the rules, at times bending them to conform to his ends.  Can the phenomena of how a person plays golf be taken and applied to political and administrative behaviour?  Psycho-social analysis?  Perhaps a dissertation has started somewhere regarding this.   <br />One President drank booze while golfing during prohibition.  He also gambled on a every game. <br />John F. Kennedy was an avid golpher, and fairly decent one at that,<BR>getting scores in the low 80s.  But he did keep the fact that he<BR>played the game secret from the public.<br />Gerald Ford played amateur tourneys and pinged the<BR>bystanders in the crowd from time to time. <br />The author played with the likes of Clinton and George W.<BR>Bush.  G. W. Bush could play through 18 holes in an hour<br />and a half, while Clinton took six hours.  (He liked<BR>to talk a lot more.)<br />In the past, Presidents didnt' want to be<BR>photographed on the greens.  Today it's acceptable, and<BR>perhaps even expected.  <br />14 mini-biographies highlighting the lighter side of the Execs as  men and the sport of golf.  Very interesting.	2003-07-14

She has claimed several times prior and in this book, that she was a \\"victim.\\"  The evidence from all of the sources including her, and legal affidavits, is: Lords turned this entire intentional scheme of hers to her own advantage in the beginning, middle, and aftermath.  There's nothing wrong with what she voluntarily chose to do.  When she got pinned, her best avenue was to point fingers, and play off of that.  No one is buying that line.  She was then and still is, cunning and crafty.  That is why she is somewhat successful today, having appeared in a couple of high profile movie roles.  All the best to her.  However, I believe she needs to get rid of the rationalization and defense mechanisms that pepper this book.  She used. She abused. She profited.  It's as simple as that.  <br />She was going to get caught, so she dropped the dime on herself.  After she got busted for what she--she alone--did, she then released a pornographic video after the age of 18, with her as the sole controlling beneficiary of the royalties.  Nothing wrong with this, but be straight up about it.  Ever since she cost the adult industry millions of dollars, and ruined many honest people, she comes out with her new persona: the clean and straight Traci Lords.  She still uses this porn name for her website, books, and T.V. interviews.  She's riding off of the wave she intentionally started years ago, and is still profiting off of it today.  This is OK.  I just hope people would see behind the lines, and Tracy Lords would admit to her ultuerior motives.  Then I'd respect her.	2003-07-12

He's been associated with the Kennedy family for decades, even covering the 1960 Presidential election.  In this book he conducts great research, conducts interviews, and corroborates what he states.  Some interesting insights are noted in this book and several living sources are cited.  Obviously, we are aware of the fact that the people that are the subjects of this book by Ed Klein are deceased and no longer able to defend themselves nor more accurately depict these stories of what was, what wasn't, and what could have been.<br /> ...The media has eaten this up.  Interestingly, the last time I checked, the divorce rate in the U.S. is over 1 out of 2 marriages dissolving.  So what?  Drug use?  So what.  Infidelity?  So what.  John Jr. and Carolyn weren't unusual, they were the norm.  Young, living in Manhattan, and monied.  Does the public expect this young couple to stay home and play scrabble, and read \\"Reader's Digest?\\"  Not really, because then it wouldn't be a titillating tale to devour. <br />This book also sheds light on a possible run for New York Governor.  Kennedy Jr. was hesitant because, the author claims, that his wife's drug use and their marriage difficulties would have brought forth skeletons in the closet that political campaigns bring about.  This book is entitled \\"The Kennedy Curse,\\" but it's major focus JFK Jr. and his wife, his potential political plans, and some private things that encourage interest among the public.  Klein conducted interviews and corroborated several sources.  This book is interesting, and it's not \\"tabloidish.\\"  <br />It is unfortunate that once again a member of this family has lost their life.  Their appears to be two camps.  Kennedys that die because of being the victim, and Kennedys that die because of risky adventurism.  Joe Kennedy was shot down after volunteering for a dangerous mission when he didn't have to, to try to upstage his brother JFK's PT-109 myth ofheroics.  Another member died after deciding to throw footballs while snow skiing down-hill.  Another overs dosed on drugs.  A rape charge here, a murder conviction there.  A car accident that leaves someone paralyzed--and in poverty.  Sadly, JFK Jr. is the latest Kennedy to go.  A lesson should be learned: don't fly planes at night if you are not qualified to fly by instruments.   <br />Klein claims with cited sources, that Carolyn Bessette was late for the plane, causing it too fly when it was dangerous to do so because of declining visibility due to the coming darkness.  She had her toe-nails painted 3 times so it could match her dress.  That is why she held up the plane.  John and Carolyn's sister were waiting on her.  She answered John's calls to her cell with repeated replies, \\"I told you I'm getting a pedicure,\\" while they waited at the airport.  (Bimbo.) <br />JFK was an interesting individual, founding \\"George\\" magazine which had fascinating articles.  Humble, articulate, and having class, no matter what John Jr. would have done in his life, he would have been captivating for the public and successful in his endeavors.  We'll never know, such is life.	2003-07-08

They are definitely provocative.  Fightin' words.  There will be shrill reactions by those that sit on the opposite side of the aisle.  Look for these responses in the media, after June 24, '03. <br />Taking snippets of recent history from primarily post-WWII to present, Coulter puts us back into the waste-basket yawn of the mass-marketed and narrow minded Conservative vs. Liberal debate in a bemused America.  How old can this get?  Can it get more boring?  Taking us on the superficial historical ride again, over the most common publicly known past events and major eras such as the Cold War, fall of the USSR, and today's War on T.  She even drops Alger Hiss's name to woo us.  Interestingly, she had the individual fortitude (which deserves respect) to claim McCarthy and his actions were noble, just, and dignified.  What this neurotic and failed Senator did was an attempt to re-enact the Salem Witch Trials.  Ruining the lives of innocents, and spurring the anti-communist paranoia which led to the creation and cementing of the omnipotent power-triad: the military-industrial complex. The Pentagon + Federal government + defense contractor corporations.  The triumvirate that is now running America.  In large part, the result of the Red Paranoia Scare, and the Cold War.  (Eisenhower publicly warned us about the above noted triad in the 1950s.)  <br />Coulter's re-hashed arguments are scrapings from the surface that we've been pummeled with for decades.  Where's the research?  Can she tell us anything new?  A boring, needless, and shallow historical analysis of something no one cares to debate in 2003: 1.  Whether Reagan brought down the Soviet Union or 2.  whether it was a self-inflicted implosion.  Trya combination of both.  The degrees of significance which 1) and 2) comprise one's mentally limited 'zero sum pie' doesn't depend on objective research, but which portion of the political spectrum the arm-chair policy analyst sits.  This question, and the world itself, is far too complex to give one single, categorical, solitary answer in the first place.  <br />Contrary to Coulter's view, the U.S. did not win the Cold War. American defense contractors, nations of Europe, and the continent of Asia did.  The alarming rate of U.S. taxation, and its' mammoth military-industrial complex are the results of the 1945-1991 struggle.  Where is the peace dividend promised in 1989?  We're still waiting.  Now the new struggle to keep the mouths of defense contractors and Pentagon officials filled is the War on T.  Even City Port officials in the U.S. are begging for millions and millions of dollars now from the Feds.   <br />She reminds us of the long-standing mis-held positions of the \\"treasonous\\" lefties and the 'righteous, nation loving' righties. This book is a reiteration of the rants of shrill television yellars such as Buchanan, Carville, Novak, Press, and a guy named \\"Tucker.\\"  The monkeys who take the stage an feign secret knowledge of what the rest of us should be aware.  \\"Liberals have a preternatural gift for always striking a position on the side of treason,\\" writes Coulter. \\"Everyone says liberals love America, too. No, they don't.\\"  She uses media buzz words like 'treason' in a time of post 9/11 bumper-sticker bliss by a nation of people who have no clue if the dubious media is telling them truth anymore.<BR>  <BR>Add this book to the buffoonery of \\"hollering\\" T.V. talk shows that leaves the audience more polarized, dense, and uninformed than they were in the beginning.  She's now achieved what she set out do to: become the self-anointed spin doctor for the \\"whatcha-ma-call-'ems.\\"  Some Liberals are misguided whiners, but if they are to be pummeled, proper depictions of history and not revisionism, should be the avenue of discourse.  <br />\\"Treason,\\" misnomer and all, will provide more sales and profits to the glut of crass and uninformative political spin books already piled sky-high.  This will shoot up to the top ten, then fall into the abyss.	2003-06-24

The person that's started this program can tell all their friends, who will go out and buy the book, and begin the SoBe diet as well.  Like any product, it needs to be marketed.  There's also a lot of competition in the billion dollar diet industry these days.  <br />You will notice this diet working for you within a week, and usually the first couple of days.  If you eat what is allowed, you can eat as much as you like.  But you will still lose weight.  The second phase of this program allow you to gradually introduce certain carbs back into your life, such as whole wheat bread.  A major tenet of the SoBe Diet is to avoid sugars and those nasty refined carbs.  Recipe and mixtures of different foods provide a large portion of this book.  This is a plan that focuses on reduction of carbohydrates.  Dr. Arthur Agatston writes this in a clear and concise manner with positive overtones.

The major analogy in this book is mice looking for cheese. Okay....interesting.  <br />A major theme of \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" is that change happens in our lives.  Really?  And change occurs at times whether we initiate it or not. That so?  And, a large majority of people are averse to change.  I do agree.  The metaphor of cheese in this book represents the things that are most important to us in our lives.  It can vary for each individual.  It can be career, relationships, spirituality, financial independence, or achieving a lifestyle change, for example. <br />This book is written in a juvenile way which insults the readers.  The concepts are redundant, impish, and oversimplified.  I am a bit surprised something such as this can continue to sell to the American public.  Or perhaps, I shouldn't be surprised at all, considering the state of the nation and Americans as a people, in June, of 2003.  <br />In regards to a person who works for a bureaucratic agency that had employees read and use this test to help people \\"feel better about themselves\\" or become efficient: it does not surprise me that government workers would be forced to read this book, bought with taxpayer dollars, and take the test, paid with taxpayer dollars, to get results that mean absolutely nothing--financed by taxpayer dollars.

What piques the interest today of the latest by Robert Dallek is the fact that he was given unlimited access to Kennedy<BR>family documents which included previously unseen information regarding Joseph and Rose.  A lot of information relating to Kennedy's ailments, and the medications he took reveal not only his poor health and chronic pain he endured but the fortitude to perform and function in the manner he did with such health problems.  <br />This should lead to some questions and possibly even skepticism.  If Kennedy was in such poor health, faking his medical records to get into the Navy, survive the South-Western Pacific, and the phony myth of the PT-109 heroics, what else could be be fabricated?  <br />Some more of his playboy philandering is noted in the now proven <BR>affair with a 19 year old intern in the White House while he was President.  This has already been corroborated by the very person JFK had the tryst with, which gives Dallek some credibility.  (The portion regarding the intern relationship was very small in the book.)<br />Another titillating tid-bit (if we can go that far) is Kennedy, although protected by the press at the time, invited an underage cheerleader to his hotel room, during the West Virginia primary, which was basically bought with Joe Kennedy's money. <br />In sum, this is a scholarly book that was heavily researched.  It's not gossipy, revealing, or an exposé into anything earth-shattering.  And it shouldn't be.  It's a historical biography, and Dallek has done an excellent, objective job.	2003-06-04

(Get my drift?)  Not to do, to avoid not being financially successful, happy, save a relationship, and so on.  We get some more....well....advice.  And, by someone who's done many different successful things in life.  Ben Stein's got a pretty interesting resumé.  I remember seeing him first in a comedy movie as a \\"nerdy professor.\\"  In addition to this he's been a former White House speech writer, securities lawyer, game show host, Wall Street Journal columnist, actor, trial lawyer, law school professor, scriptwriter, novelist, and author of several books on finance.  He's also one of those folks whose home overlooks the Pacific Ocean from from the heights of hills in Southern California.  You could say he's done a few things life.  <br />Like many works of this genre, this can be read quickly and is to the point. This is a clearly written book, peppered with lots of Stein's wit.  It's informative and helpful in providing a mental attitude as well as actions to achieve one's goals.  We need to occasionally asses how we perceive the world, because our attitude defines the opportunities that present themselves to us, and the subsequent decisions we make.  He reminds us of the many things that are important, that perhaps we've subtly forgotten as we've grown up to become busy, cynical adults.  And this book is also funny.  It'll make you laugh at times, and that's also a big bonus.  (That's what more books on these subjects need these days.)  Kudos to Stein, he's done something new again--successfully.	2003-05-29
US	52947165	R2OSMCJBCR0XHG	0310205719	36906356	The Purpose Driven Life	Books	4	8	18	N	N	Applicable To Today's Grind	A person lent me this book.  I'd never browse through it at the bookstore because I usually don't read these types of works.  But I did read it in part because upon reading the title I realized this was another of a growing number of works that target an ever increasing market in America: Americans who have no idea that there is more to life than shopping to buy silly things, keeping up with the Joneses (via appearance & debt), and talking about all the things they're going to do \\"someday.\\"  (It's never now, but in the \\"future.)<br />But what's interesting here is that this book is composed of the standpoints of Christian-leaning philosophy or mentality.  Nothing wrong with this.  If there's been tons of books in the feel-better-about-myself and spiritual genre to hit the shelves toward the mostly un-religious Americans, this is a good opportunity to provide something to the tens of millions of the population that are Christian.  But the benefit is that a person doesn't have to be one to gain from this guide to healthy living. <br />The author Rick Warren is a pastor who writes very clearly and there is a Christian bent to the book, but it's not overwhelming and the concepts he discusses can be used and applied to anyone, regardless of faith, or lack there of.  As is often when using translated scriptures of any religion as the basis for an assertion, belief, or thought process, abstract words are taken and applied to modern, real, living.  Taking words, phrases, and themes and \\"interpreting\\" them to suit oneself goes back to the beginning time.  For those people that are Christian I assume there will be heaps of rhetorical disagreement over this book.  <br />But there is also a useful \\"real-life\\" practical application to \\"Purpose Driven.\\"  As an example, for all of the footnotes he refers to only 18 out of over 800 that refer to the Christian bible.  This convenient and very practical book is comprised of 40 short chapters, intended to be read over 40 days time (ifone wants to).  It can be understood and applied to all components to the general public, meaning, one doesn't have to be a Christian to benefit from, apply, and enjoy this book.	2003-05-26
US	52947165	R3UDYKJPN8WAX6	0300091710	719115060	The Fragile Middle Class: Americans in Debt	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Could Happen To You, Could Happen To Me	This is not a &quot;sky is falling&quot;  or alarmist book.  It's not a negative gloom-and-doom book.  It does focus on an unwanted event we consider negative, and it does occur in millions of peoples' lives.  Da Big &quot;B.&quot;  It could happen to you, it could happen to me.  Authors Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook have decades of experience in the industry and provide one of the most detailed and accurate pictures of the people and circumstances within it.   <br />In addition to statistics and research, tables, and graphs, the authors conducted detailed surveys of 2,452 people and provided case histories of folks that filed for bankruptcy in the 1990s.  They come from all income and occupational levels, and from all geographical areas of the country.  Just like you and me.  It only takes a hiccup.  Keep your eye out for the legislation that will be coming forward.  Although it would be unpleasant, bankruptcy is not the end of the world, by any means.  There are worse things that can happen in life.<br />The &quot;Fragile Middle Class&quot; has non-biased an informative information on....us.  What is the reality behind the so-called middle class?  While millions of individuals and families are members of this club, and we have a definition of what qualifies people as being part of it, what is the financial health of the American middle class today in 2003?  Real income is still declining, even after the economic boom of the 1990s. (This was a pseudo economic boom). Personal debt is at record levels.  If truthful accounting and honest financial disclosures are conducted, being middle class means living paycheck to paycheck, on the brink bankruptcy, due to even a minor financial hiccup: divorce, a staggering medical bill due to illness or accident, or loss of a job.  The authors' introduce the new concept called &quot;skidding,&quot; which is when a person changes jobs, which results in lower pay, and therefore less income coming in.  And they discuss the record number of people who've recently gone bankrupt.  This book is about those, who are most of us, that teeter on the edge.  <br />First, debt is essential to living in our modern economy, and when used properly is good for us, and benefits the economy.  We can't  now, and have never been able to pay cash for our home, or a new or used car.  When people invest in real estate or a business, they borrow capital.  Having leverage is actually better.  However, total Debt ratio is the largest it's ever been, combined with stagnant and declining wages.   2/3 of the American economy is dependent on consumer spending, completely dependent upon people spending their on money on--everything.  One example, out of thousands, is the recent public &quot;begging campaign&quot; from politicians and high-profile business spin doctors in New York, imploring people to &quot;come to New York and spend money,&quot; to revive the economy.  When there is a slight dip in consumer confidence we hear about it from the media, because it's considered so vital to the U.S. economy. <br />This book uses historical as well as current notes, stats, and case studies, with the majority of the findings from the results from the decade of the 1990s.  It is obvious that the tech-boom of the 90s was a temporary band aid that was applied to a long-term sociological and economic bullet wound.  Financially, Americans are in some of the worse financial shape they've ever been in.  Why is consumer debt at an all-time high?  Why over one million bankruptcies per year?  This book conducts research and analysis that paints the modern day picture from the perspective of people in the bankruptcy industry.  And today, the bankruptcy numbers are so significant that the Federal government will soon pass legislation in an attempt to reduce the numbers of Americans filing.  However the reduction in the number of filers means major changes need to be made by our societal and cultural expectations, financial institutions, andpersonal spending habits and behavior.  Something that Congressional legislation can't do alone.  There will be an impact, but it will be minimal.  One could adopt my personal attitude, which is simply not to care.	2003-05-26

She includes a comprehensive and diverse collection, including the early and most obvious works, such as Francis Scott Keyes' Star-spangled Banner to the Grateful Dead song titled &quot;U.S. Blues,&quot; written in 1973.<br />Americans can brush up on, or remember songs and poems they used to know when they were younger, as well as read a multitude of new ones for the first time.  American Literature and History students will find this collection of hundreds of works, worth getting and keeping.  Here is a following example of some of the quintessentially American 13 chapters of categories such as: Visions of America, Portraits of Americans, The Rule of Law, The Individual, The Right To Be Left Alone, Equality, Freedom Of Speech And Press, and the lengthiest, titled &quot;Work, Opportunity And Invention.&quot;<br />We can be reminded of Emerson, Faulkner, W.E.B. DuBois, Robert Frost, Thomas Paine, Melville, Patrick Henry, and Henry David Thoreau, which are brilliant and timeless works that make up who and what we are today.<br />But the inclusion of many pieces that we've never been exposed to is what makes &quot;Patriot's Handbook&quot; rise above.  There are excerpts from famous, and not-so-well known speeches, and a number of significant Supreme Court Cases.  For example:  &quot;Songs of the Sacred Mysteries, Sioux, 1869, &quot;The Marine's Song,&quot; 1891, &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game,&quot; 1908, Frontiero vs. Richardson 411 U.S. 677 (1973), &quot;Blowin' In The Wind,&quot; Bob Dylan, &quot;Marbury Vs. Madison,&quot; 1803 to Andy Warhol's &quot;Popism.&quot;  <br />Great as this is, the release of the book is about timing. I stand behind my other comment.  The inclusion of Bill Clinton's speech on a controversial issue as well as a speech by Hillary Rodham Clinton reminds us of current political perspectives, whether we agree or disagree with them.  With the comprehensiveness and diversity here, this book will be popular for a long time.	2003-05-21

He has the thoughtfulness of keeping his personal opinions out of his work and presents the facts.<br />The black markets in America today, though a significant part of the economy, functioning in free-market form, exist everywhere.  However, they don't seem to get much media coverage.  This review is in regards to the portion of the book focusing on Marijuana.  For example, the local television media in Seattle has repeatedly stated over the years, though seldom, that Washington state's number one export is not Apples but Marijuana.  So, why the hysterical legislation, laws, Feds, and police presence regarding it.  It's number 1 because there's a demand, and there will always entrepreneurs to supply a product that people want.  Schlosser also examines the War on Drugs.  No one can argue today, that it has even been minimally successfully.  <br />One example of the failed war on drugs in addition to price increases and violence, is the case of an Ohio man.  Mark Young is now serving life in prison without possibility of parole for participating in a minor marijuana deal.  In a comparison, you could approach someone, say a mother walking with her children, and blow her head off with a shot-gun and serve less time in America in most states.  Whether in a moral, legal, or economic sense, we live in a nation that has simply lost most of its' common sense.  <br />One of Schlosser's solutions to reducing the sweepingly negative societal negative effects are decriminalizing marijuana.  Interestingly, he doesn't support the government regulating and taxing it.  Many proponents of decriminalizing Mary Jane believe they can reduce or retract Marijuana laws by giving the government a motivation to do so: more revenue via taxes, and, allowing the government to regulate it.  And, regulation = control.  All this would do would give the government the impetus of taking more money out ofcitizens' pockets.  Imagine, how high those taxes would be, considering green-13 is a \\"sin\\" and would be under the guise of \\"sin taxes,\\" like cigarretes and alcohol.  The government would also control who gets to grow it, how they can grow it, where they can grow it, where they can sell it, and how much they can sell it for.  Like farming in America today, can you imagine large Corporate Marijuana growers?  These newly government appointed bureaucratic corporate fat-cats would have lobbyists on their behalf, dig for federal subsidies, loans, federal land, and who knows what else.  <br />Schlosser is one of the nation's most insightful and effective writers in contemporary America.	2003-05-13
US	52947165	R1PPVH6B2TESZC	0740703579	669904317	The Millionaire Mind	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The Truths Destroy Common Stereotypes	I read the \\"Millionaire Next Door\\" when it came out in 1996, and was really taken by the facts behind these people.  The \\"Millionaire Mind\\" is just as interesting and focuses on general qualities, attitudes and beliefs, and a lot of factual studies and stats of millionaires.  Most of them are self-employed and don't work for someone else. The good news is, they're for the most part, regular folks.  They live in the same houses, drive the same cars, and have the same egalitarian attitude that us non-millionaires have.  <br />What is strikingly different and very interesting is the millionaires' attitude toward money.  Millionaires don't tend to live in, nor aspire to live in \\"prestigious neighborhoods.\\"  Nor do they go into large amounts of debt to drive \\"luxury cars.\\"  This concept is what author Dr. Stanley calls \\"Income-Statement Affluent.\\"  But the non-millionaires often do try to do this, and go into the debt to give the *impression* to other people that they are doing well financially.  The 1,371 millionaires studied overwhelmingly avoided what is called \\"earn-and-consume\\" and conspicuous consumption.  <br />This book also delved into the childhood, school years and aptitude tests for these folks with a net worth of at least 1 million.  Many things society and our educational system marks as indicators of who will become economically successful are simply inaccurate, and often flat-out wrong.  Placement tests in school, for example often offer contradictory results as to a person's strength, aptitude and abilities in particular areas.  Some references remind those who've read some of Robert Kiyosaki's recent books.  Most of us, even business majors, aren't trained to look at entrepreneurship, but instead seek to work for a corporation.  Dr. Stanley asked his group of business students what the top 10 most profitable small businesses were in America.  He didn't hear on correct answer (page 222).  He provided the examples of how Korean immigrants that come to America study small business models, operations, and profitability through networking, Korean trade associations, and Korean-American cultural organizations.  In the 1970s for example, the most profitable small business was dry cleaning.  The percentage of these Korean owned small businesses was extremely high.  They are looking to own and operate while the rest of us (including me) by choice, look to work for someone else.  Add the long hours of hard work, in this particular case, of the Koreans, and you have a higher chance of becoming financially independent.  Other ethnic and racial groups (i.e., in Los Angeles) sometimes make complaints about the Koreans' success because they don't see through the same perceptions (like most of us in America).  <br />What was the most valuable thing these millionaires learned in college?  Hard work.  And, 88% percent of millionaires sited the importance of being able to accurately judge people (page 100, Table 3-1).  It wasn't grades.  The average grade point average was 2.92. 78% percent responded that \\"hard work is more important than genetic high intellect in achieving financial success (page 106, Table 3-3).  And, the average millionaire drives a Ford. <br />Dr. Stanley worked with and compiled information from the University of Georgia and Geo-demographer Jon Robbin of Harvard.  There are 46 statistical charts.  There are numerous themes and references to Robert Sternberg's \\"Successful Intelligence.\\"  Worth buying or checking out.	2003-05-11

This book provides a reader friendly, detailed synopsis of McDonald's through decades of the original brothers, to Ray Kroc's entry and exit of what would become one of the most recognized oranizations of the world. (Whether this fact has positive or negative implications is another matter entirely). This is a good book about Mickey-D's and sheds light on many other aspects of American history, diet, culture, business and advertising. <br />Two brothers named McDonald went west to California from the north-east. They came with about about $8 dollars in their pockets (according to them) and got jobs moving props on movie sets in Hollywood (sound familiar?) After some initial business ventures the brothers opened their own small restaurant in San Bernadino. <br />Meanwhile, in the Midwest Ray Kroc left school at 16, and like almost all other achievers that reached his level of success, he had a strong work ethic and a hard-driving tenacity to succeed. Expecially at concepts that intially proved successful (hence SOP procedures).  How ya build opon something that has a good and successful foundation.  A gifted, successful salesman from an early age, he got a job selling paper cups and sold them for 17 years as one of the top salesman of his company. Some of his clients for example, were Wrigley field's vendors, among other Chicago establishments. In his late thirties, he started selling shake mixers. McDonald's comes into the picture when Kroc noticed that two brothers who owned a drive-in hamburger restaurant in Southern California, kept ordering lots of shake mixing machines, when Kroc's mixer business was dying out everywhere else in the country. He met the McDonald brothers and was greatly impressed by their practices. Ray implored them to expand and they replied \\"who'd want to do it, we don't,\\" and Kroc became the seller of their franchises in the Midwest.  He was very successful at establishing McD's in that part of the country (hint).<br />For his work he didn't earn a lot because of the deal he made with the brothers (an inkling of what was to come). So he added a creative and logical way to profit from his diligent work in spreading the franchises. He formed a separate corporation, and when setting up franchises he'd purchase the property where a new McDonald's was to be built, from his own original corporation he created.  (Read Robert Kiyosaki's \\"Loophoes of the Rich\\" for details).  So, with his corporations being the owner of the property, Kroc would either collect the rent, or a percentage of the restaurant's profits, whichever was greater, by contract structure. This allowed him to be compensated more fully in addition to his original deal with the McDonald brothers, which wasn't the most favorable.<br />Kroc was selling the franchises and focusing on keeping the model and SOPs identical for every franchise. Perhaps an analogy to the assembly line of the Ford. Kroc had a methodology. If a winning method was not altered or diluted by individualistic owner operators or franchise restaurants here and there across the country, the sales, expansion, and growth would continue. McDonald's had tapped into what a large part of the American public wanted in post WWII America. Ray later bought McDonald's from the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million cash. When he discovered after the deal was finished that the original McD restaurant in San Bernadino was not included, and was to be kept by the brothers, Kroc had forced them to change their restaurant's name on legal grounds, and then and built a franchise across the street to put them out of business.  The brothers asked for this, and likely didn't understand 3 major things: 1. ethical business practices 2. the law 3. common sense. <br />Advertising: to help solidify more growth and consumer loyalty, Kroc knew the value of kids. He hired topadvertising people: enter Ronald McDonald. After some marketing tests in some particular regions, came the major nationwide promotion to get the kiddies pleading with their parents that they wanted to go to Mickey-Ds. Have you heard kids clamour their parents to do this? I have. And today, McDonald's has continued the kid-concept by investing large amounts into the Playgrounds added onto many of its' stores.<br />McDonald's represents many things about American culture. To Americans, and today throughout the world. No matter what you think of Mickey D's it's quite an interesting story of how it started, evolved and came to it's ubiquity today. It's a fact that those golden arches are more recognized than the Christian cross. Again, whether we think that's good or not leads to several other issues involving, chemicals and food science, general health, obesity, globalization, homogenization, marketing to children, and corporatization. <br />For additional insights into the McDonald's phenomenon read, Jennifer Talwar's \\"Fast Food, Fast Track\\" and Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,\\" and Fumento's \\"Fatland.\\"	2003-05-06

Here is an an overview of the origins and current status of the epidemic of Suburban sprawl, and it's heavily documented and scientifically researched consequences. Some of the concepts discussed include zoning laws, regulations, lost tax revenue, lack of aesthetics, and anonymous \\"soul-less\\" suburbs filled with alienated people. <br />Obviously, people have to live somewhere. They have to buy groceries and shop, send their children to schools, and live in a neighborhood that's desirable. Are separate residential and commercial zoning laws the only way? Are large sub-divisions of residential track-housing, the only option? These plans usually necessitate a car for doing anything and everything, no matter how trivial. In metropolitan areas with high population densities, we need to get in our cars, drive through congested traffic to eyesoric strip-malls, even to buy a loaf of bread. There is no sense of collective community, even in a mental sense. Office parks are separated, yet connected by hiways, into islands of emptiness. There are also negative economic consequences. It has been been proven from varieties of sources, that the current suburban model not only strains but debilitates the economy. There is a heavy-toll placed on the residents of these widespread areas.<br />How many times have you heard people say \\"the traffic is terrible,\\" while they are driving their vehicles everyday to do virtually everything? Have you ever heard, \\"where do all these people come from?\\" or \\"I wonder where they're all going?\\" Answer: they're doing exactly the same thing you're doing: driving through suburbia, everyday, for everything, and anything.  As the population continues to increase in the United States we'll see unprecedented massive growth of suburban sprawl under the current plan of the suburban model. It's not revamping the model entirely that may make living under these circumstances more livable, but some minor well-thought adjustments....	2003-05-04

The latter comprising of  the most common-sense, statistically backed-up, and realistic approaches to life, career, and finances for the New Economy.  Most people then, and still now, follow an outdated philosophy designed for an economic environment that began the dissolve in the early 1970s.  <br />How many MBAs do you know who that have job security today?  Which job # are they on?  How about those lovely stock options?  How many have blown their chance of retiring by their late 30s (unless they switch models soon)?  Pollan's model for the new economy: \\"quit today, pay cash, don't retire, die broke.\\"  Mass firings, down-sizing, and layoffs have been rampant in the 1990s when this book was written (1998), and they will continue as companies will have to cut their costs, oft-times quickly, in order to remain competitive and survive today (2003).<br />In \\"Live Rich,\\" Pollan has 98 short but informationally full chapters ranging on lifestyle, employment, to investing.  The first seven are philosophical and the latter ninety-one are \\"Putting Theory To Practice.\\"  Some chapter titles are: insurance, networking, benefits, financial ratios, mentoring, creditor relations, negotiating, receivables, payables, and seed money among many more. <br />The first chapter, is entitled \\"buying your freedom,\\" and notes that freedom is subjective and means a different thing to different people.  For some it's a dream house on the beach, or being able to make a living from sculpting and painting.  Perhaps, spending more time with family, traveling the world, or starting one's own business.  Freedom involves doing what one wants to be doing.  Is being a W-2 worker, paying high amounts of taxes throughout your life, and waiting for the end of it to do what you want, freedom?  Some folks can tremendously benefit from reading this latest work if they can change the way they've been conditioned.  For those who haven't read Stephen Pollan yet, it's better to read \\"Die Broke\\" first.	2003-04-30

After some initial business ventures the brothers opened their own small restaurant in San Bernadino. <br />In the Midwest Ray Kroc left school at 16, and like almost all other achievers that reached his level of success, he had a strong work ethic and a hard-driving tenacity to succeed at a concept that in+tial+ly proved successful.  How ya build on something good.  A gifted successful salesman from an early age, he got a job selling paper cups and sold them for 17 years as one of the top salesman of the company.  Some of his clients were Wrigley field among other Chicago establishments.  In his late thirties, he started selling shake mixers.  McDonald's comes into the picture when Kroc noticed that two brothers who owned a drive-in hamburger restaurant in SoCal, kept ordering lots of shake mixing machines, when Kroc's mixer business was dying out everywhere else in the country.  He met the McDonald brothers and was greatly impressed by their practices.  Kroc become the seller of their franchises in Illinois, and was very successful at establishing and McD's in the Midwest.<br />For his work he didn't earn a lot because of the deal he made with the two brothers (an inkling of what was to come).  So he added a creative and logical way to profit from his diligent work in spreading the franchises.  He formed a separate corporation, and when setting up franchises he'd purchase the property where a new McDonald's was to be built.  He'd collect the rent or a percentage of the restaurant's profits, whichever was greater.  This allowed him to be compensated more fully in addition to his original deal with the McDonald brothers, which wasn't the most favorable.<br />Kroc was selling the franchises and focusing on keeping the model and SOPs identical for every franchise.  Perhaps an analogy to the assembly line of the Ford.  Kroc had a methodology.  If a winning method was not altered or diluted by a franchise restaurant here and there across the country, the sales, expansion, and growth would continue.  McDonald's had tapped into what a large part of the American public wanted in post WWII America.  Ray later bought McDonald's from the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million cash.  When he discovered after the deal was finished that the original McD restaurant in San Bernadino was not included, and was to be kept by the brothers, Kroc had them change their restaurants name, and he built a franchise across the street to put them out of business. <br />Advertising:<BR>To help solidify more growth and consumer loyalty, Kroc knew the value of kids.  He hired top advertising people: enter Ronald McDonald.  After some marketing tests in some particular regions, came the major nationwide promotion to get the kiddies pleading with their parents that they wanted to go to Mickey-Ds.  Have you heard kids clamour their parents to do this?  I have.  And today, McDonald's has continued the kid-concept by investing large amounts into the Playgrounds added onto many of its' stores.<br />McDonald's represents many things about American culture.  To Americans, and today throughout the world.  No matter what you think of Mickey D's it's quite an interesting story of how it started, evolved and came to it's ubiquity today.  It's a fact that those golden arches are more recognized than the Christian cross.  Again, whether we think that's good or not leads to several other issues involving, chemicals and food science, general health, obesity, globalization, homogenization, marketing to children, and corporatization. <br />For additional insights into the McDonald's phenomenon read, Jennifer Talwar's \\"Fast Food, Fast Track\\" and Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,\\" and Fumento's \\"Fatland.\\"	2003-04-30

These people are compensated for it if they educate themselves and IF they succeed.  And on the contrary, being an employee is for most people.  Much less control but some security, the routine of the comfort zone, and a familiar role defined within the job and confines of a corporate or governmental job.  But today, for the employee, is there job security?  Is there a routine and comfort zone?  Will your job be there for you every morning?  And, when it's not, will it be gone by your choosing or your employers?  <br />After only a few chapters we'll once again be reminded of the futility of being a W-2 working stiff, perfunctorily accepting the crumbs that are left over after taxes.  This book will be most beneficial to people who have recently, or have now just started to change, the way they think.  Experienced small business folks,  entrepreneurs, and MLMers, will likely (but not necessarily) already have most of this information down.  <br />The premise of &quot;Loop-Holes&quot; provides us with the facts: since the 1943 federal tax law tragedy Americans work, pay taxes, earn, then  spend.  All in that order.  After taxes and paying expenses, what's left for the middle class person who works as an employee?  Ask yourself how much YOU have left.  Whether your a service sector employee or upper-middle class professional, how much of the money you earn, goes in your pocket?  And of what does go into your pocket, how much of it stays there?  If you file a W-2 and are classified as an employee you will work a lot, but you are not likely to &quot;make money.&quot;  But you will have the liabilities (&lt;--Kiyosaki) of a mortgage, car payment,credit card debt, and dinner out at a local budget franchise, once a week as a treat.  Welcome to the reality of 2003, America.  The common notion of getting raises at work as an employee to earn a higher income has unfortunately become a fallacy today.  &quot;The more you make, they more they take.&quot;  Congratulations, you've just been bumped up to a higher tax rate.  <br />Diane Kennedy provides more facts, proven strategies, and common sense than what we get from our educational system, and electronic and print media.  Kennedy's information is contemporary, valuable, and necessary knowledge that we need on how to proceed in making our lives better.  To pay an advisor for this knowledge would be costly.<br />These is a lot of practical information and real-life examples provided in Loop-Holes:  <br />If your starting a business in hopes of receiving passive income in the future, there are 9 criteria the IRS uses to qualify your gig as a &quot;true business&quot; and not a &quot;hobby business.&quot;  The latter scenario cannot be used to deduct losses from your earned income.<br />Setting up Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)is highly recommended when investing in income producing real estate for the protection of personal assets.  And how this is structured is very important.  The C and S corporations are are also covered.  When, why, and how should you begin the process.  Deductions, leasing, licensing, royalties, trusts and many more things are explained also. <br />People often state how great it is to get the the tax deduction on mortgage interest:  What do you get on average?  For every dollar you pay to the bank in interest on a mortgage, you get 30 cents back with the deduction.  I'll take it, but is 30 cents on the dollar a good deal to you?<br />There are several questionaires to fill in, so a person can assess (honestly!) what their true financial situation is.  Their risk tolerance, what resources they can tap into, and what timeline can be established.  Very important is the team of folks needed for a person or couple to be able go to for advice, support, and information. <br />The most common money people work and toil for is the W-2.  As we know this is the 50 percent money we hear about from the Rich Dad Advisors.   Great, you just got a raise.  And, so did the government.  Find out the steps to start making the other 3 types of money with Diane Kennedy.  This is excellent, especially for folks without a lot of business background, to understand the some of the nuts and bolts.	2003-04-29

His experience is based upon research and his work as an Osteopathic physician.  He's also the Director of the Optimal Wellness Center in the Chicago area.  In other words, he's got the resumé.  <br />Dr. Mercola is one of a growing number of physicians that conclude that the current USDA nutritional food pyramid is not conducive to our bodies' needs nor optimal health.  In fact, it's flat-out not healthy.  To Mercola, significant or excessive amount of carbohydrates are the major causes of weight gain, a number of diseases, illnesses, and disorders.  However, this is not an exclusively anti-carbo diet or regimen, but simply a reduction.  And, for the good, this is not an absolute no-grain diet.  After some time on this program people can introduce grains back into their diet.  What's new here is that Dr. Mercola is also not a proponent of the high protein diet programs that have become so prevalent in recent years. <br />There are three phases of this eating and living method.  Three-day, fifty-day, and the long-term maintenance plan.  Achieving the optimal weight and being healthy is the goal of this diet program.  <br />You can learn a lot about foods and what they do to us.

Don Mitchell and Carol Coles are experienced business people who provide positive and helpful ways to remind us that innovative thinking and actions put us on the road to achieving better results in today's competitive marketplace.  With the foundations of the basic models we have, and putting creative and innovative strategies to work in our own environment: industry, location, competitors, employee relations, putting our ideas to work, and much more.  This is of high value for middle and upper managers in large companies, and in particular helfpul for the small and medium sized proprietor or manager.  Some of the best models, ideas, and real-life experiences are illustrated, and can be used by anyone who wants more customers, more loyal employees, higher sales, or more traffic.  The ideas here can get you to think outside of the box.  This is important, because after a period of time, people start thinking less about slight changes, innovations, or implementing new ideas, no matter how small, cost-effective, or profitable.  The innovations don't have to be expensive.  Oft-times they won't cost you a dime, and they'll increase your bottom line.  Here's an example.  Note that it's a simple one.  <br />An interesting example of \\"Adjusting Prices to Increase Sales\\" in chapter 2, reveals the story of a couple who owned a small, struggling roadside store.  In 1936, After 5 years of trying to stay afloat, they thought of an idea that made their store famous.  Offer free cold water to folks driving pass them on interstate hiway close to their store.  Their struggling little store was called \\"Wall Drug,\\" in Wall, South Dakota.  In the year 2000 I actually stopped in and spent money on my cross-country trip, because of the billboards, name recognition, and so many people telling me \\"you have stop at Wall Drug.\\"  This simple idea in 1936 garnered this store income 64years later.

The author does back up what he writes very well with good research.  It's important to hear a voice that is not within the mainstream media today.  Unfortunately there is little alternative to the generic corporate electronic and print media in the modern U.S.  This has an effect on the way the masses think, perceive, and hold opinion.  <br />As for the gist of this book, there are numerous examples in our lives that reveal the fact that money, power, and influence go hand in hand.  The author chose particular examples supported by investigative research and corroboration.     <br />First, the United States is not a democracy.  The military-industrial complex, electoral college system, Political Action Committees (PACs), soft money, and corporations, shape public policy and control the United States political system at the federal level.  Political policies of the states are less influenced by the above mentioned special interests, but they are following the similar path of the Federal government.  This encroaching anti-democratic corporate-military dominance has been increasing significantly since the end of WWII.  President Eisenhower, the former general, was the first to warn of the \\"growing emergence of the military-industrial complex\\" in the 1950s.  And today in 2003, how right he was.  <br />One misconception that most Americans have, thanks to American media propaganda, (major networks, cnn, etc.) is that markets promote democracy.  There are some correlations between free market economies and democratic societies.  There are also many correlations of free market economies and autocratic dictatorships, and oligarchies.<br />There are some examples of the abuse of power that the author chose to elucidate that may not be to everyone's liking.  Apparently, Palast thinks convicted felons--if they are black--should be allowed to vote in elections.(Perhaps because nine out of ten of them vote for Democrats might be the reason Mr. Palast thinks this way.)  Jeb Bush did the right thing in Florida by having felons excluded from the polls.  All felons of every background, should be kept from voting.<BR> <BR>Palast notes the old news of how Clinton and Bush both instructed the FBI and other officials investigating terrorist links to the Saudi government not pursue their investigations further, basically turning a blind eye.  It would cause embarrassment, ruffle feathers, and stir up discontent.  the editing in this book, like many today, is poor.<br />The WTO, the tool of wealthy nations to more efficiently exploit poorer nations (in the name of the misnomer of free trade) is examined and more facts of this organization's policies are presented.  The World Bank, which benefits only a few, has also done a thorough job of destroying nations' economies, and lowering the value of their currencies from Argentina to Australia.   <br />Palast speaks clearly and concisely.  His arguments are cogent, sound, and backed-up.  I hope he continues to give us, the ignoramus masses, an alternative to the terribly bland and generic sources of distorted and biased information we Americans are constantly inundated with.  Read this book, and it will open your eyes if you're new, or reinforce what individualistic common sense you already have.	2003-04-22

This review focuses on the roots and causes and why their is such attention paid to this part of the world today.  Bernard Lewis taps into what many of us in the West are unaware of.  The eclecticism and the historical occurrences in the Muslim world since the time of Mohammed up until now.  Different cultures must be respected for their own particular value systems.  However, as most other areas of the world have made (and attempted to have made) inroads into women's issues, democratic reforms, education, and academic intellectualism, it is unfortunate that most of the Islamic world has been left behind.  Not in a technological point of view, But moreso from a civilization perspective.  <br />Why the hatred towards the \\"infidel\\" West?  Why do many young Muslims from Egypt to Pakistan blame the West in general and United States in particular for their difficulties, which all societies have?  part of the reason is the flammable untruthful rhetoric spewed from the Mullahs at Mosques.  The intertwining of radical fundamentalism, and the political.  Preying upon impoverished youth, many of whom educated, aware of the wealth and economies of other nations, and realizing there own situation offers little (and realistically no) help.  One of the concepts Lewis referred to was the \\"failure of modernity.\\"  On the intellectual front, to underscore the Islamic world's ignorance it was noted that the entire Arabic world translates only 330 books per year, which is the same number as the nation of Greece.  Much different today, than a time when the Islamic world was at the forefront of human academic and intellectual progression. <br />From an economic standpoint things do not look promising for the Islamic world.  A large percentage of the population is currently under 15 years of age.   As the population explodes this will cause more acute shortages of water.  Continued migration to urban cities, inflation of poverty and suffering, an and education system that can't keep up with the rest of the world.  Therefore, the current Islamic angst will continue as it has been.  The question is, will this frustration be acted out upon us, or only reveal itself on the Arab street with chants, ephigy burnings, and self-flagellation.  One billion people follow this religion.  Lack of hope, self-induced failure culturally (Taliban, Wahhabism), politically, and economically, the fringe elements of the Islamic world will continue to be the basket case that it currently is.  What they need to do, is look at themselves.  This is where they'll find the roots to their problems.	2003-04-19

It seems every angle and potential situation is noted here for home buyers, sellers, or anyone contemplating this major undertaking.  The chapters are organized perfectly for you to go immediately where you want to go in this book.  <br />Think of all of the millions of people who purchased their first home recently (2002-3), motivated by the lowest interest rates in decades.  Many of them have likely paid higher and/or unnecessary fees, or had the process slowed because they weren't willing to read 30 minutes a week to get the basics down.    <br />The duties of all of the 7 most common players in a home purchase and sale are described.  The RE Agent, Broker, Lender, Property Inspector, Escrow officer, Financial and Tax Advisors, and Lawyer (if latter need be) are included.  What should be expected of them,  negotiating fees, which party pays them, and what actions are considered the norm and reasonable are detailed.  And of course: all of the potential red flags, and how to spot them are enumerated also.  What 11 questions should you ask the Real Estate Agents you interview to represent you? Find out here.  <br />Most folks don't keep track of the details of the current home <BR>values more than the generalities of it being a cold, sluggish, warm or hot market.  There are instructions in this book on specifically how you can get comparable pricing of the values of what you are looking for in a home in the community you live in.  <br />For some of the nuts and bolts, in the financing chapter for example, there is a list of 22 items you need to bring to a mortgage lender:  original copies of the 8821 Form, inspection report, the closing cost worksheet, and various sections of the U.R.L.A. will give you confidence of having at least the basic background knowledge so you can know what to expect when you begin the process.  How much will Homeowners insurance cost you? It's here.  Doing your homework before-hand is much better than learning as you go along, which can surprise, sadden, cost more, and at times intimidate the first (or 2nd time) buyer.  <br />In the back of the book there are appendixes that contain more original documents, such as the Purchase Contract.  There is a comprehensive glossary of terms, and an index.  <br />Another helpful book is &quot;The 106 Most Common Mistakes Home Buyers Make (And How To Avoid Them)&quot; by Eldred.  But HB For Dummies has much, much, more.  HB For Dummies provides the most bang for buck.	2003-04-17

Vicky Lynn Hogan from Mexia, Texas.... <br />Written by Eric and D'eva Redding, who worked with Anna Nicole Smith  in the past.  They were intimate with Anna both personally and professionally.  Their writings and observations have been widely corroborated.<br />The story begins with the buxom blonde waitress at a chicken diner in a small (proud as usual for no reason) Texas town.  It ends with her having achieved a dream, albeit with a few bumps and turns along the way.  Anna Nicole Smith did make it to the industry heights, modeling and being \\"Playmate of the Year\\" in Playboy magazine.   She sponsored Guess Jeans before they dumped her.  She also appeared in some film roles.  She took the only thing she had (like the rest of us) and sold it: herself.  She acted upon opportunities, and that is success in itself.  <br />But what can turn a reader against her (who are we to judge another person in the first place?) was her treatment of Marshall II, the 91-year-old-near-death man she married, for one and only one reason: da money.  Nothing wrong with wanting security, and he wanted to marry her.  But on her end she provided him with damaging neglect, lies, humiliation, and abandonment.  After their wedding vows were exchanged she immediately left for Greece that very same day with her body-guard/lover on the obtuse pretenses of having to do a \\"cover shoot.\\"  When Marshall II died 14 months later she hadn't even visited him in a month.  Later she would sue in court to abscond with \\"half of what he was worth.\\"  She claimed in court Marshall II promised her \\"half of what he had.\\"  There was never anything in writing to this claim.  While he was alive during their brief marriage, having spent unlimited amounts on Anna's monthly allowance, buying her homes, cars, trips, clothes and more, he made an irrevocable will cutting her out of his net worth.<br />For Anna, life in West Los Angeles in the media spotlight appealed to grandiose inclinations.   She rented the Brentwoodhome where Marylin Monroe died on Helena Street in her futile attempt to parrot her--Anna should have gone all the way.<br />Some of the bad publicity for Anna came from:<BR>Her Honduaran house-cleaner and nanny charged her with sexual assault and other abuses and received $800,000 dollars from a jury.<br />Public debauchery in the fast and furious LA nightlife scene. Pills, booze, and late-night drive-thru Taco Bell binges.  Nothing wrong with debauchery, but with her endorsement of products and the paparazzi snapping away, she was on the road to being non-sponsor.  <br />After her pseudo-hubby died, she tried to change the funeral plans and disposal Marshall's body, even though he had previously stipulated his wishes to be cremated in writing.  By Anna claiming she converted to Catholicism (laugh), which opposes cremation, she muddled up the  funeral 'ceremoney', forcing a court (yes, a court once again) to decide what should be done with Marshall's body.  Even in his death, she offered insult to injury to the memory of Marshall II and his family.<br />Soon after, she sued for money he didn't want here to have. A federal judge (in LA of course) broke Marshall II's will and gave her 450 million dollars, even though he legally and specifically ommited her from his will. Is this America?<br />When a rich person dies that's when the war begins.  When it comes to money there are usually a lot of fingers in the pie.  When it comes to money.... <br />Marshall II's son came to the rescue.  Pierce Marshall, son, and stellar attorney Rusty Hardin (he had Texan written all over him) took on Anna in a Houston courtroom.  She was exposed for what she was.  In the end another judge reduced her 450 million (LA court) judgment to a paltry 88 million dollars.  <br />She got da money in the end and today in 2003, she has a T.V. show.  But knowing her, she'll file for bankruptcy within 10 years, if she doesn't eat herself to death, O.D., or crash her car.  Again, my question is: Vicky Lynn Hogan, a \\" great big beautiful doll?\\"  Maybe an ever-expanding over-inflated one full of hot air, glazed eyes and bad breath.	2003-04-16

For one, most of the topography is flat, and it's a coastal desert paved with transplants with ambition and liking for the sun.

His involvement in the movie business producing films, influenced in part, as an avenue to get to the ladies of the screen.  Details of his relationships with the stars of the day are illuminated.  Taking dates to the mounted cross atop one of the Hollywood Hills, overlooking the flatlands and lights of LA.  He even crashed a plane into 3 houses in Beverly Hills.  <br />His 3rd plane crash, occurred while performing a flying stunt during the shooting of a movie (the stunt pilots refused to do the stunt because they considered it too dangerous).  As a result of that crash he was in the hospital with critical life-threatening injuries.  This was when HH was introduced to Codeine for the severe pain, something he would become addicted to for most of the rest of his life.  <br />The book later progresses in the latter years of Hughes.  Today, it is apparent to contemporary psychologists that Hughes was likely suffering from a form of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  Nowadays, OCD is more understood and highly treatable with medication.  In HH's time, it was not thought of in biological and physiological terms.    <br />Hughes' first break came when he entered a screening room and stayed in it for 5 full months.  He didn't bathe, watched the same movies 30 times over, and survived on a diet of candy bars.  Hughes consciously and voluntarily turned over his business affairs to competent managers.  These were employees, and were people who made prudent decisions and looked out for HH's best interests.  During this time, other sharks started to gather.  Such is the case when large amounts of money is involved.  Bill Gay, one of Howard's chauffeur, made crafty and cunning political moves to ascend over the years.  He got Howard's ear, and became more influential on him.  Gay eventually took the reigns of control over Huges' wealth.  He then deftly purged the other business managers who served Hughes with dedication and integrity.  The former chauffeur and his fellow Mormon henchman took over Hughes and his affairs, isolated him, and squeezed out those who cared for Hughes and wanted the best for him.<br />It's sad, for during the latter decades of Hughes life it seemed that no one was really there for him, if he had wanted anyone to to be there.<br />In death, over one thousand--yes, 1000--people came out of the woodwork to lay claim to Howard Hughes wealth after his passing.  <br />To this day, We're still not sure if his death was natural, self-induced, or the intentional doings of others....	2003-04-05
US	52947165	R3QAP7Q2BLUDML	0465041213	670404372	Made in Texas: George W. Bush and the Southern Takeover of American Politics	Books	5	39	45	N	N	Very Deep Insight Into Bush 43	Author Michael Lind, a 5th generation Texan, provides a dual biography of a President and the state of Texas.  This is what makes it so interesting.  Many authors have recently published books regarding Bush 43's personality and policies, specifically, in response to September, 2001.  In this book however, Lind analyses and examines George W. Bush's policies and links them to the influential continuum of the cultural and political forces of Texas: the Deep South, Southern Protestants, and the Neo-conservative foundations that were solidified by his father's, administration.  In short, what he's doing today according to Lind is not solely or even significantly as a result of September '01.  Obviously as for any policy-maker, Bush 43's current policy-making in general is derived from himself, and his convictions are the result of his primary influences, past and present.  Therefore the question is, what is this spectrum that influences him the most? <br />Texas<BR>Lind expands more on his home-state of Texas.  The state of Texas is often seen misappropriately, as culturally Western, but in fact it's clearly Southern, and Deeply Southern.  This has always been apparent to those who've lived in and/or studied the South and Texas.  <br />There are two camps in Texas: One is the &quot;Texas modernists,&quot; of which Bush 43 is not.  Lind categorizes Bush 43 as one of the &quot;Texas traditionalists.&quot;  These are proponents of militarism and an economic base focusing on commodity exports and oil exploration.  This southern economic model which George W. advocates, Lind claims, will continue to push for free-trade agreements which send U.S. jobs oversees, and entice out-of-state companies to move to southern states because of lower wages.<br />These are but a few examples and insights Lind provides.  He's not a fan of George W. but this isn't over-bearing in the book.  If one wants to understand the rational and philosophy behind Bush's domestic and foreign economic, military, and diplomatic policies this book provides a wealth of information.  It also explains the interests, cultural, sociological, and political forces of Texas, and its' major components.  Those interested in national electoral politics such as the next Presidential election for example, can take much of this information and ask them self: who in 2004 can appeal to the southern block, which still is obviously instrumental in winning a Presidential election.	2003-04-05

Together with the carbohydrate mania, fat mania has overtaken the media and the billion dollar diet industry.  In this informative and easy-to-read book, the role of fats and oils (lipids) is further examined.  Even fast-food pits distribute fact sheets about dietary fat, and consumer groups relentlessly press this killer to public enemy number one in their crusade. Enthusiastic writers have produced whole books about fat.  Ironically, in a nation that is the fattest in the world.  However, it is a fact that too much of what they have written or said is either incorrect or incomplete. <br />In &quot;Know Your Fats,&quot; a serous effort has been made to keep the terminology understandable and in accordance with the terms the public sees in the plethora of reports written for consumers by government agencies. Occasionally, scientific words are necessary to use for technical terms in order to avoid simplistic wording that would not be accurate. A user friendly glossary of these terms regarding fats, oils, foods, and lipids in biological systems, is at the end of this book. <br />This book by Mary Enig, Ph.D., will be of interest to those into nutrition, and/or how eating affects the body from a biological standpoint.  But it is written to be fun and easy to understand by the average person (like me).  Also helpful, is that you'll learn about the relationship between dietary fat intake and your health, and the specific links between dietary fat intake and disease.  So you can learn, and/or also apply what's in this book to make you healthier.	2003-04-05

Perhaps the year 2010 should be inserted into the title?<br />Put 3 economists in a room and you'll get six answers, if your lucky.  A good idea is to read books put forth by economists 10 years and longer in the past.  You'll see how often most of them are not only misguided and incorrect, but also out on planet Mars.  However, some offer good insights into cyclical trends and patterns juxtaposed with current political, technological, and societal evolution.  Now, you can keep this in mind when you are reading the current books, newsletters, and magazines from economists, investment gurus, analysts, etc.<br />Dr. Batra covers many facts of the 1980s such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986, banking conditions, and the exportation of American labor and manufacturing jobs to LDCs among other conditions.  <BR>Covering dozens of areas in investing, here is one example of advice.  He specifically advised people to liquidate tax-deferred savings such as KEOGHS and IRAs.  page 178 states: &quot;Premature withdrawal of funds in Keoghs and IRA plans may then be the safest bet in spite of various penalties, especially if they are entrusted to non-banking institutions.  The next question is: what should you do with the money?  Can you trust the banks at all?&quot; ---end quote.  Batra then promotes the danger of putting money in banks.  Real estate is also getting ready to crumble.  He did state several times, that he hoped his forecasting would turn out to be incorrect, and he (as all economists seem to do), provide the solutions via tax restructuring, monetary policy, and budget allocation.  <br />Interesting, is that these forecasts were obviously made before the exponential growth and explosion of the Internet, which greatly transformed the economy, and markets.  So....what would the economy have been like had it not been for the dot.com explosion?  And, now in 2003, after that bubble has burst, will there be wage growth and middle-class job creation in the years to come....?<br />His &quot;Law of Cycles&quot; has eruditic roots.  Batra, an avid reader and self-studied student of world history, international trade, politics, and humanities, noted several areas of the world and the-then present conditions that brought him to his conclusions.  He did have the courage to write his beliefs (which he profited from tremendously), and write them in a very easy-to-read way for the masses, or laymen population. (Marketing?)  In sum, reading economic books of the past, whether theory, or in historical factual disciplines, helps us make better decisions today, in our attempt to gauge the future.	2003-04-03

Something right out of an early 1960s yearbook.  Looking like an all-American Tuesday night bowling leaguer in a working class suburb.  \\"A bottle of bud and a shot of whiskey, please\\" to boot. <br />The cyanide random poisonings sent waves of trepidation throughout the Puget Sound.  Your stop for pain relief off of a random counter can relieve everything.<br />To help her secure more insurance money in knocking off her husband, she put cyanide in a random bottle, placed it on a grocery store shelf, and then waited for an innocent person to die.  This would take the focus off of her when she decided to rid herself of her boring tee-totaling spouse, and have authorities conclude it was the result of the random cyanide killer.<br />But there was one unfortunate self-derived detour for Stella.  After the coroner listed Bruce's death as the result of natural causes because of his chronic poor health, she realized she could get more insurance money if his death was listed as a homicide.  She contacted the police and told them of her suspicions, leading to new tests not performed on the autopsy.  His death was then listed as homicide.  But her push for more ended up doing herself in.<br />The one major mistake she made was not washing out a bowl before the mixing up the cyanide ingredients in her kitchen.

The &quot;Long Walk&quot; is one of the earliest books written by Stephen King under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, and it's not a horror story per se.  King wrote this during his freshman year in college during the Fall of 1966 and Spring of 1967.  This is a great book. And, one can tell at this early time of writing King had a knack for description, in addition to creative ideas and story-telling.  When King submitted it in a writing competition it was rejected without any comments.  So, he through it into an old box.  <br />In the &quot;Long Walk&quot; the backgrounds, motivations, beliefs, and social attitudes come out in the characters as they walk together. Ray Garraty (the main), McVries, Olson, Baker, Stebbins, and Barkovitch.  Each has a distinct personality.  The latter, Barkovitch, is the vituperative, harping, anti-social antagonist.  <br />What piques the reader and human nature, is that these guys chose to participate in this competition.  They were among 100 selected across America.  The very few to be accepted for the Long Walk.  The prize for the single winner is everything you want for the rest of your life.  For the rest of the 99 they get to rest, eternally. <br />Like in almost all good stories, the conversations among these fellas can lead one to think about his/herself.<br />To find out who wins, read this great piece of work by a young Stephen King.	2003-04-01

Conditions were deplorable.  Abuses rampant.  Marx's response to this and his theoretical solution originated and evolved during this period in London.  After this period ended due to public outrage, legislation and union movements, Marxist ideology was not modified by its' followers, but reinforced, with it's (outdated) concepts.  After digressing from implementing (the doing of) Marx's major points they erroneously continued to advocate the motto and principles (the theory) of Marx's original critique. <br />This book by the Furets is not about communism's policies, practices, and affect on certain societies.  It's about its' idea, ideology, and vision.  This makes it compelling.  Because in the future there may be some who claim that communism wasn't \\"interpreted,\\" or \\"implemented\\" correctly.  Hence, they may advocate a \\"new\\" or \\"more effective\\" form or version of communism again in the future.  This book takes a look not only at the the origins, interpretations, and implementations of Marxist ideology, but the disastrous ramifications of it.  In actuality, Marxism was and still is nothing but heuristic value, becoming as passé as Freud by 1900.  Marxism, in its true form, has never existed beyond the political theory in the books of Marx and Engels.  Over 100 million people died as the result of this vision, which was never brought to fruition.  No one can honestly argue against historical fact that today in 2003, that the altered and diluted form of communism that was implemented imploded, self-destructing from within.   <br />Two Main Communistic Ideas That Never Came Into Existence  <br />1.  Marx: \\"the state will whither away\\" = State Communism<br />Did the state dissolve because there was no need for it, as Marx theorized?  He wrote that the \\"state would whither away,\\" because there would be no need for it to exist.  But in the Soviet Union, the state was the most ever-present, omnipotent, and omniscient facet of Soviet life.  The Soviet government was a monopolistic corporation: controlling, owning, producing, surveying, imprisoning, legislating, decreeing, and supplying, everything.  Some claim this was the \\"Soviet Interpretation.\\"  This is impossible because one cannot interpret what was never stated nor implied.  <br />  <BR>2.  Was the communist party representative of the proletariat or the  average person? <br />Membership of the communist party was a very small portion of the population.  Those who rose to Apparatchick status had special privilege and practiced and received favoritism in many areas of life.  This small group of elites dictated to everyone else what to read, listen to, think, study, and say.  Consequences were severe.  In addition, most communist nations were rampant with venal bureaucrats, corruption, internecine politics, self-interest, censorship, secret police, and control of the media.  Citizens were not allowed to travel.  Is this a society based upon equality? Of the proletarian, or \\"working man?\\"   <br />Were there various interpretations or Marxist ideology?  <br />The basic principles proposed by Marx (and Engels) were never applied in any of the communistic societies of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, or Cambodia.  This makes it as a working, applicable ideology, even less credible.  Marxism was never implemented in the real-world.  It was an empty dish of critiques that was later filled with food of alien ideas.  There is no documentation that Marxism has ever been practiced or has ever existed in recent world history (save agricultural communes).  <br />Marx's critiques of capitalism were critiques and critiques only, offering only limited and vague general theoretical alternatives.  These blanks would later be filled in by Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Le Duan and Tito among others.  Only a few of Marx's tenets, were practiced by communist nations (i.e., atheism, agricultural collectivization).  <BR>   <BR>After the fall of communism, these nations have the audacity to ask for financial aid and business know-how from the United States in particular and and Western Europe and market-economy-based nations in Asia.  What strong ideals these people have....	2003-04-01

Having earned a rather high income during the mid to late 1990s this person has--absolutely nothing to show for it, except  debts.  Of which, won't be eradicated, or even significantly reduced for several years.  As with most Americans today statistically, as their income increases their debts increase (and proportionally as well).  The more money one makes the more debt they have.  And, most of this debt is for things that depreciate: cars, the latest-gotta-have-electronic gizmos, and other things that show a mundane and unfulfilled life and/or banal socioeconomic status.  (As Robert Kiyosaki states so adroitly, there is good debt and bad debt.)  Don't buy \\"stuff.\\"  <br />For the nuts and bolts of the book, there is a convenient summary of major topics, that includes two tables of contents.  A condensed table of contents as well as a detailed table of contents, for quick referencing.  There is also a comprehensive index, and a list of further recommended readings. <br />The information in this guide will be known already for those who've chosen to live simple and for the most part debt-free.

Where did the photography term \\"candid\\" come from?  Erich Salomon, an early photojournalist, who so enthusiastically wanted to capture the true and natural human condition, he hid his cameras in hollowed-out books.  The authors note quite correctly, that keeping a low-profile, shooting frequently and rapidly, brings the best chances of getting a successful candid--because very few shots actually will capture those moments that typify everyday life. <br />Some photo history tid-bits mention for example, that in 1878 Eadweard Muybridge won a famous bet.  He wanted to prove that all four of a  trotting horse's hooves are off the ground at one time.  His picture proved him right.  <br />Some photographers' works and their techniques explained in the the J of P include: Annie Leibovitz, Joyce Tenneson, and one of my favorites for unique shots of natural wonder and travel photography, Galen Rowell.  The chronology of photojournalism, pioneered by Dorothea Lange, is also covered.  <br />The authors note that as you take more pictures of what feels good and right to you, you will start to develop your own unique style that is yours.  It's a style that you and others will be able to recognize.  Photos, are a part of you: your likes, perceptions, and beliefs about what is worth immortalizing.  This takes place on a subconscious level as well as a cognizant one.  You can't always quantify it; that's the beauty of it.<br />Digital is steadily making it's way to dominate photography.  But still, For the 35 mm this book contains hundreds of tips, techniques and practical advice, expressed plainly, that will make all the difference in your photos.

Here are two of my favorites: <br />LAMERICA<BR>In my humble opinion \\"Lamerica\\" reveals his thoughts on suburban sprawl, encroaching development, and the never-ending tendency for humans to destroy the places where they live.  How true then (Viking and explorers who extracted resources).

Students are individuals and they usually learn in the most optimum way in one of, or in a combination of these areas: attention, memory, language, spatial ordering, sequential ordering, motor, higher thinking, and social thinking.  But the value of this book comes from Levine's incorporation of scientific research to show readers how these eight neurodevelopmental systems evolve, interact, and contribute to a child's success in school.  We've had the endless &quot;theoretical&quot; studies of different learning styles.  Levine provides the needed punch: what should the parent and educator &quot;do.&quot;  Here is the foremost how-to on reshaping the futility of &quot;one-size fits-all&quot; in our educational system, which doesn't tap the true potential, capabilities, and interests of our students.  <br />The key for an educator is to not only identify which students learn more conducivley from the eight learning styles, but then tailor course work for them.  Student-centered proactive activities that offer more personalization and localization make this easy to do.  With one-on-one tutoring and small groups, it's obviously less difficult for an instructor to identify and utilize lesson plans  than in a class of 15-20-25 students, obviously.<br />For students that have been labeled as lazy, unmotivated, or &quot;slow,&quot; it is for some students correct.  But for many more of them that are tagged with this generalization, it's a misnomer.  One that often isn't even uncovered as the student moves through and graduates from the school system. <br />Another great book in addition to this one is Howard Gardner's &quot;Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences.&quot;	2003-03-21

As a result of Epictetus, we quickly realize that people were and still are in search of the same thing today that they strived for two thousand years ago: happiness, fulfillment, accomplishing goals, and possessing a sense of worth, among others.  Such is the human ego.  As powerfully yearning for fulfillment then as it is now.<br />Some familiar with Epictetus' works assert he had an influence on historical and contemporary psychology because his writings influenced many modern shapers of thought in Roman times, which are the roots, in part, of our eclecticism.<br />Epictetus was born a slave around 55 A.D. in Phrygia, on the eastern boundary of the Roman Empire.  One of Epictetus' quotes we often hear (phrasing slightly altered) today and need to be reminded of is:  &quot;Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the thing I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&quot;<br />Some of the time tested &quot;isms&quot; here are from the titles of his mini-chapters. Some examples,<br />*Know what you can control and what you cannot<br />*Conform your wants and expectations to reality<br />*Avoid adopting other people's negative views<br />*Happiness can only be found within<br />*No one can hurt you<br />*Those who seek wisdom in life will be ridiculed<br />*Never suppress a generous impulse<br />*Character matters more than reputation<br />&quot;Manual For Living,&quot; interpreted by Sharan Lebell, is a small book that can be easily carried around, and quickly referred to.  Instead of heading to the next Dr., psychologist, or self helper, get &quot;Manual For Living.&quot; It's the got the same information at a fraction of the price.  Epictetus may have left our world of humanity quite a long time ago, but his message is immortal.	2003-03-20

This book by Alterman is an important book at an important time.  (Here we go again--another.)  The significance is the examination of the media:  producers, writers, journalists, editors and reporters.  The majority of Americans get their information via the electronic media today (unfortunately).  And then, some additional info. from the print media via their newspaper.  This book is in large-part a response to Bernard Goldberg's book and his tour, which received lots of attention and scrutiny.  Goldberg was objective, truthful, and candid.<br />It seems the recent growth of conservative television and radio was a response to the (correct assertion) that the mainstream media was liberally biased.  On average, 79% of newspaper reporters vote for Democratic Presidents in national elections.  One can research unlimited stories over decades to see the left-wing spin on articles in newspapers and television reporting.  <br />The recent conservative programs are a response to the common perception of a dominant liberally-biased media.  These conservatives are more direct, confrontational (in a debating sense), and more open about where they specifically stand on issues.  This strikes a chord among some liberals and left-wingers.  In contrast to the right-leaning media outlets, the left-leaning mainstream media is less direct, more subtle, and uses tilted language to spin a story.  This subtlety and tilt, is often not intentional.  It's just the natural expression of the viewpoint of the people covering the story.  Yet because it is a bias of course, it is not good reporting.  A person's perception is their reality.  Reporters are human.<br />I've often scoffed at the headlines that are chosen for a particular a story in many newspapers. The headline influences the way people immediately perceive a particular story, policy, or action.  An example of a liberal newspaper that is unbelievably biased, but is so subtleit significantly influences the publics' perception of a story is in Seattle.  &quot;The Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; may be the worst case I've witnessed, among several large-city dailies.  <br />In the end this book doesn't offer an honest look at the people who don't do their jobs: journalists and reporters.  Alterman and many other journalists should examine all forms of bias, not just bias of a particular bent. We won't see that happening.  Read this book chapter by chapter, simultaneously with Goldberg's.  Again, instead of exchanging the impish bickering between the shallow left and right, the professionals should focus on what their job is: report the occurrences of our society in an objective, unemotional, and unbiased manner.  Unfortunately, they haven't realized that yet.	2003-03-19

A compilation of the works of Langston Hughes, Whitman, Frost, Stevens, William Carlos Williams, and Dickinson.  This anthology was the result of the efforts of Joel Conarroe, who provides a great down-to-earth introduction as to why he put this together, and what influence poetry has had in his life.  While a freshman in college decades ago, a classmate and mentor gave him some off the cuff advice that Conarroe would follow for the rest of his life. Before each author's segment there is a biography describing their life, motivations, and outlook.

Many things that are common-sense are not necessarily things we're aware of in the work-place.  It's primarily geared to people in sales.  But it provides invaluable needed points on the peripherals to success in sales, relations with co-workers and management, and fine-tuning your sales career's ups and downs.  If things occur that are bad or good, we need to accurately identify the reasons why.  Then take the best approach in dealing with it. <br />It's easy to overlook the many things we assume are peripheral but actually are integral to our sales and work environment.<BR>  <BR>The structure of the book is very convenient for the reader.  This book doesn't need to be read front-to-back, and the subject your searching for can be found quickly.  Its' table of contents with 18 chapters containing sub-topics are categorized in an easy-to-find way to jump straight into the topic you want to read about.  <br />Some of the chapters list and explain many points to consider when choosing a company to work for as an Account Executive.  What are the criteria for you to stay or leave a company? How should a salesperson handle enormous success at a corporation?  A terrible sales slump?  If your loyal to a manager who is shafted what do you do, if anything?  Solutions to stress.  How do we recognize burnout and defeatist behavour in our lives that affect our performance, and what do we do about it?  Sales positions are less political than other jobs in corporations, but one must be at least cognizant of the peripheral politics.   <br />&quot;Guide to Greatness in Sales&quot; appears to get less attention than other works by Tom Hopkins, but it contains unlimited amounts of invaluable and practical information.  Many of the topics both good and bad, I've had first-hand experience with (as anyone), and assuring yourself of looking at a situations objectively and then taking the best course of action, is why this is so helpful. <br />After you finish it, it'll be a good idea to keep it on the shelf where it's accessible. As time goes on this can be a valuable reference for things that we need to remain aware of.	2003-03-19

The title is \\"portraits\\" so the theme will be more often than not of people's faces.  Their expressions, their feelings at the moment of the shot, their life, where they are, and where they've been.<br />Many of these photographs are striking, and if you like to travel you can do the same as McCurry does here.  I would have liked a small caption about some of the people that were in this collection.  Who are they?  What is their story?  Obviously it isn't always possible or necessary to collect the facts and tid-bits about subjects, but at times it would have added something to the colorful photos of these folks.   <br />Those who've followed McCurry and love photography likely have high expectations, and may feel that they should get more from \\"portraits.\\"  With \\"Portraits\\" and its' beautiful photos of these residents of the world (primarily Asia), you can enjoy and respect McCurry's work.

When some hear of a book penned by a Secretary of Treasury an incipient yawn creeps into them.  But \\"For The Record\\" is lively and interestingly written.<br />Coming from the Wall St. world of Merrill Lynch, where he spent 35 years, ending with the position of Chairman of the Board, Regan had a strong attitude.  He had amassed $30 million dollars from his work and endeavors in the private financial world prior to joining the Reagan administration.  This net worth was what he referred to as [***] you money.\\"  He wasn't dependant on anyone, or any particular organization, and instead of being a squimish \\"yes-man\\" so common in the private and public world, Regan was more of himself.<br />He did note several things the administration did, that the media and Americans didn't catch on to.  For example, cutting spending by 3% which was tied to a matching tax increase, while at the same time telling the American public that they were having their taxes cut (p. 223).<br />Many bills are named by names and number, as well as the logic and debates that molded them into what the finally became.  During his gig, Regan had proposed a VAT tax, commonly used by socialist nations (i.e., western Europe).  Before the 1980s Tax reforms the U.S. had a 14 bracket tax system that went from tax rates of 11 to 50 percent.  Afterward, 3 brackets were created which were levied at 15, 25 and 35%.  These numbers are presented in the context of real-life using realistic and easy to understand examples. It's important to note that at one time in America, there was 91% tax bracket.  <br />Memoirs and autobiographies usually focus on things conveniently remembered and bad things not mentioned.  This work details many things about the policies and people involved in Washington and the policy process during Regan's tenure.  Those into economic policy, monetarism, 1980s politics and policy implementation, or history will find it good.	2003-03-18

The life and times of the Kulaks was recounted as well as the persecution they endured under Stalin and the Soviet Union's collectivization policies.  Stalin's totalitarianism, persecution and murder of millions is well known and documented in history, but his disastrous collectivizationist agricultural policies are often overlooked and not closely scrutinized when covering his reign of terror.<br />Millions of people starved to death in a region that was the \\"bread-basket\\" of the Soviet Union.  Some out of desperation ate wall paper.  The misery of millions was caused by this illogical policy, but instead of altering it, Stalin blamed not himself but--you guessed it--the Kulaks.<br />After the massive declines in agricultural production because of the Kulak's lack of incentive to work what did Stalin do?  Accuse them of being recalcitrant counter-revolutionaries because they wouldn't work for free.  He punished them further with killings, deportations to labor camps, and harassment by communist officials, in a futile attempt to motivate them to produce.<br />Will people toil the fields performing back-breaking labor to have their work confiscated by the government?  The Kulaks stopped producing wheat, and then sent what they harvested above subsistence level to rot, throwing it into the river.  <br />Other communist collectivization policies related to this book by Conquest are thos of the Later communist followers of the Soviet Communist model: Mao's China, in which 35 million people died.  Later, the post-1975 communist Vietnamese under Le Duan did the same, resulting in a near famine.  During this time of communist collectivization, the Vietnamese were actually importing rice from other countries because their farmers wouldn't grow produce any.  <br />This is a historylesson on stupidity.  Hopefully, because of books like these, history will not repeat itself.	2003-03-17

The languages are listed by familial grouping, then individual languages, and then nation by nation.  Easy-to-read charts elucidating families, sub-groups, branches, and major and minor languages are listed in the front of the book.  Individually, the languages are listed in the index in the back of the book in alphabetical order making them easy to find and cross-reference.  One can quickly find which languages are related via sub-families.  You can bounce around from page to page with this. <br />Each language listed is presented with a sample such as a poem or proverb followed by an English transliteration.  Also included is the number of people who speak it, and in what different parts of the world.  The languages' family, idiocyncracies, major grammar points, alphabet, and stresses are noted.  As an example, here's a paraphrase of the Finnish language presented in the book:<br />Spoken by 5 million speakers in Finland, 70,000 in the U.S., 200,000 in Sweden and 50,000 in Russia.  Finnish is one of the few languages in Europe that is not of the Indo-European languages family. Like Estonian, it belongs to the Finno-Ugric languages which are a branch derived from the Uralic family.  Finnish is difficult language to learn for Western native speakers because of it's non Indo-European origins and the the fact that it has 15 noun cases. <br />Also in the beginning is a biography of the families of languages and explanations of the migrations of people, many thousands of years ago, that has created the current multi-varied linguistic make up of our world today.	2003-03-15

You can look at \\"Three's Company\\" and consider it to be the first widely acclaimed and loved comedy that was \\"all about nothing.\\" That's one of the reasons why this show (and Seinfeld) were so popular. Great writing, characters, and actors, that allow a comedic escape from the mundane routine and sincerity of our daily lives. <br />All episodes of TC, \\"Three's a Crowd\\" and \\"The Roper's\\" are listed in the book. Providing biographies of the actors and actresses, author Chris Mann goes on to uncover the behind the scenes history of the many aspects of Jack, Janet & Chrissy. The disagreement and fall out with the producers of the show and Suzanne Somers is covered without taking sides. The politics and animosity. The producers did engage in a legalistic smear campaign against Somers and tried to degrade and humiliate her as much as possible before giving her the axe. TC was not to be same again without here. Her departure had an effect on the show and Somers' 2 replacements, Jennille Harrison and Priscilla Barnes (the latter refused to be interviewed for the book) are also described in this book. <br />Like all television sit-coms that run a long time it becomes difficult for the writers to stay fresh, and as the show came to an end after 8 seasons, the producers were already planning a spin-off off of \\"Three's Company.\\" Instead of being forthright and honest to the cast about the killing of the show and the spinoff with Jack Tripper (\\"Three's a Crowd\\" that bombed immediately), the producers and John Ritter were deceptive and crafty. <br />Joyce DeWitt (among others) discusses bad relations with the producers involving intimidation, arrogance, and treatment so inconsiderate she never did return to television. I love the show but sure don't like the industry from which it comes. <br />\\"Talk about hers and hers and his, Three's Company too.\\"	2003-03-15

Wells has always been one of the more interesting baseball players, personality-wise.  Or perhaps he's just a little different than most players in MLB, and that's appreciated by some in a sport that conjures straight-edge [people]. <BR> <BR>Reading this book was interesting in certain places and it reveals the perception of one person.  So I think it should be taken for what it is.  About one person's perceptions with some stories about his life along the way.  People shouldn't take it too seriously or have a tizzy over it.  It could have been written a little bit better.  It will not be remembered for more than two months.<br />Why the \\"scandalous\\" attention given to this book?  Because Wells is not [like] many baseball players, nor does he portray the image MLB wants to convey.  He's not a \\"goody-too-shoe.\\"  He's not a clean-cut, mom and \\"apple pie\\" type of guy.  He is who he is and he's fairly honest, with some exagerrations here and there.  <BR>The brass of the Yankees claim he \\"hurt the image\\" of the organization.  What image?  Of Steinbrenner (Mr. Nutcase), the South Bronx, obnoxious fans, and a team thate buys world series rings because it has hoards of T.V. revenue.  Take this with a grain of salt. <br />Other books about a player's perceptions in regards to the game and the people that may be of interest are \\"Ball Four\\" by Bouton, and \\"Omar!\\" by Omar Vizquel.	2003-03-14

I am a person that was (is) in sales and am not a manager.  This book can be helpful for those new to sales, and help them find or become more aware of the style that works best for them.  Some of the pooches described in this book I've worked with,  such as the Poodle and Golden Retriever, for example.  A person can also innately have some of the elements of more than one or each pooch.  <br />The most important thing I like from this book was the fact that there is no one particular style or character trait to be successful in sales.  In certain industries with certain products and clients one breed will in general be more conducive to positive results than others.  But the main point is that there is no perfect way (i.e., the Pit Bull) to achieve your goals.  Each person is an individual and they can recognize and improve their natural strengths they posses as well as import a couple of characteristics from other breeds of pooch.<br />Another great book that notes the disadvantages of the Pit Bull is &quot;Low Profile Selling,&quot; by Tom Hopkins.

Is this a nation of anxious people?  Furtive?  I believe many people are anxious.  Glassner points out the many \\"fear\\" alerts that we are inundated everyday with: local T.V. news, news-magazines, Journal of American Medical Association findings, advertising (there's a cure for every terrible thing--if you *buy* it), terror alert warnings, local T.V. and newspaper reports on heinous crimes--which are a rarity.  Violent crime by youth is down considerabley in recent years, yet the news coverage of youth violence is up 600%  It's a fact that getting hit by lightening is more likely to occur.  <br />News producers and broad-casters like shock value and surprising stories.  (Don't touch that dial!)  Scenes of flashing red and blue lights, and yellow crime scene tape.  awe-struck bystanders crooning for a peak.  Interviews from shaken witnesses followed up by a person who lives nearby, who says \\"I never thought this could happen here.\\"  Hide in your homes, lock your door, buy a guard dog, carry pepper spray, whistle, and stun gun--don't forget the cell phone--I know a lot of people who bought a cell phone for \\"safety.\\"  In a community with extremely minimal crime. <br />Child abduction is a terrible thing perpetrated by bad people.  But with 20,000 homicides per year in the U.S. why does the media jump on one particular case in Missouri, Ohio, or Oregon for that matter?  <BR>And then relentlessly tortures us with its' boring redundancy as it develops?  Will this one crime affect my community 1000, 2000, or 3000 miles away?  Do I care about this crime?  Of course not.  But this \\"bad thing\\" bomabards us on a daily basis via T.V., radio, Internet, and on the first pages of our newspapers.<br />The one thing I didn't agree with or understand was Glassner's belief that guns and guns alone cause crime.  I've never heard of a gun picking itself up, loading itself, and firing itself on it's own.  People commit crimes.  Accidents are caused by irresponsible people, as well as irresponsible gun owners who don't lock up their guns.<br />He also states that poverty causes crime.  That's old news--and an old cliché.  Motivation, and a respect for education can reduce crime--if these \\"poor\\" people decide to do something for themselves.  Stop having babies, partying, and start reading books.  Those in poverty have often (but not always) made many bad *choices* and done poorly *chosen* actions to get where they are.  If someone is in poverty in America, they've really got problems.   <br />Thanks to Glassner who appeared on \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" (which I haven't seen) some won't focus on the latest finding that caffeine will kill us, all strangers are dangerous, the economy will crash, an Earthquake will get us, kissing take years off of our lives, and riding in airplanes are dangerous.  <br />His correct take and truthful voice, supported by research, is few among many, unfortunately.  But Glassner's insightfs can lead some to see things from a different and more positive perspective.  The only thing we have to be annoyed with, is fear itself	2003-03-11

He was not the average Soviet citizen however.  He was one of the fortunate few who were allowed to leave his country and spend time abroad.  He was afforded the rare glimpse of American life and culture during his time there in the 1930s.  This obviously is a part of him, as is his other numerous experiences.  In addition, he also candidly shared his personal life with us.  (When he saw his old-flame coming the opposite way on an escalator, for example).  Pozner is down-to-Earth and it's easy for a reader to like and to relate to him.  <br />I read this book when it first came out and went over it again recently, 14 years later, finding it in an old box of mine.  His writings prove that he had good instincts on where his nation and culture, and the world was heading at the time he wrote \\"Parting with Illusion.\\"  He has the oration and writing ability to explain his viewpoints as well as the perceptions of many Russians when he wrote this book in 1989.  He discussed Stalin and his legacy, and the graft and corruption that crept into the USSR, becoming commonplace by the 1960s.  <br />Now, 14 years later, I wonder: where is Vladimir Pozner? I haven't heard or seen him since the late 1980s or perhaps early 90s.  <br />At the time, he was articulate, and an astute observer of current affairs.  Possessing a gifted knack for passing his observations on.  <br />Today, in 2003, where is he now?	2003-03-11

It's such a contradiction to have a multi-billion dollar diet industry thriving, propelled by 1 out of 4 Americans on a diet, while obesity at the same time is an epidemic.  This interesting contradiction is why I picked up \\"Fat Land.\\"<br />I am one of those overweight American people with a few intermittent ups-and-downs of the \\"lb.\\" roller coaster.  I try to eat healthier, but do indulge on stereotypical American food, which in general is garbage.  When heart disease is the number one cause of death in a nation, the food is bad, and the choices of what people eat is moreso to blame.  McDonalds and the likes of it are the roots, with their marketing, scientific R & D, and their construction of \\"plastic playgrounds\\" to get kids dragging their parents to Mickey-Ds.  They want their customers to start young.  <br />But: McDonald's doesn't put a gun to peoples' head and force them to eat there.  It's a choice.  Choice is one of the great things about American society.  Kroch stated he didn't intend for McDonald's (and fast-food) to become the staple of the American diet, and he, like anyone including myself, won't turn customers away who've CHOSEN to eat there.  <br />Fast-food has become and integral aspect of contemporary American culture.  Whipping through the drive-thru to get a gut bomb on the way home while sitting in the car through rush hour traffic, after having sat through the day in front of a computer at work, and then later doing the same at home.  That's Sedentary lifestyle with a capital \\"S.\\"  Like a lotta folks I read the newspapers and listen to the radio reports and see the T.V. stories about the \\"whys,\\" and \\"hows\\" of the American flab epidemic because it's an interesting (and disappointing) thing.  Supported by scientifically authenticated research, sociological studies, and an objective look at the truth of American lifestyles and eating habits, we learn more about what we talk about so often: fat.  Being overweight, wanting to lose some El-Bees, exercising, and this and that new promotion just given birth from the billion dollar weight loss industry, with the before-and-after-pictures to boot.  This, is us.<br />\\"Fat Land\\" goes deeper and examines the dramatic change in eating trends that have occurred over the last couple of decades.  What we eat, where we eat, how we eat, is all a part of several demographic trends, lack of time (wanting convenience), lifestyle changes, increased restaurant portions due to food wars, fast-food inundation, and us loving delicious fatty foods.  Sedentary lifestyles resulting from technological advances (less physical work & lifestyles), and 324 channels on our satellites are parts of a puzzle with many pieces.<br />This is an interesting look at a current phenomenon that we'll continue to hear about.  For further reading check out, \\"Fast Fast Nation,\\" by Eric Schlosser, and \\"Fat of the Land,\\" by Fumento.  The latter is a previous book (1997) that deserves much more attention that it's getting.   <br />This book by Critser provides an interesting look into why and how many of us got this way.  Understanding these reasons can provides us more opportunities to change.	2003-03-11

He compiled 2 years of his columns in chronological order.  He also includes his diary revealing his insights and perceptions into the aftermath of the attacks in 2001.  With &quot;Longitudes and Attitudes,&quot; we can go over information he presents, investigate into these topics further, agree or refute with certain perspectives of his, then come to our own individualistic conclusions.  <br />He included some very significant interviews from many influential people in the Middle East, in addition to traveling, note-taking, cultural observations, and discussions with every-day people.  The opportunity to analyze information and engage in our own thought process is possible with this book and this is what's lacking from the mainstream press (which Friedman is apart of, being a columnist for the &quot;New York Times.&quot;)  Although a few perceive liberal bias from him, I perceive balance, albeit with some journalistic and personal eccentricity, which we all have within us.   <br />When it comes to September 2001, and the Iraq situation 2002-3, the mainstream media have bombarded the American public with intellectually shallow sound-bites, histrionics, haute couture Iraq topics, irrelevant speculation, charades of patriotism, the perpetuation of myths, incorrect public statements, false reports, ivory tower &quot;experts,&quot; and retired military pundits who co-habitate with a T.V. clicker and  speculate on the many talk shows, &quot;yelling programs,&quot; and &quot;spin shows,&quot; ranging from left, middle, to right.  With &quot;Longitudes and attitudes&quot; you can, on this rare occasion, think, rationalize, and decide for yourself <br />Friedman is a thinker and by reading this, an American can be provoked to think for themselves, instead of having the spin doctors from far left to right do that for them.  <br />Friedman's classic book &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem&quot; is worth taking a look at.  It's relevant today.	2003-03-10

Such terms and concepts such as Hyponymic Hierarchies, Hypernyms, and semantic changes are given in laymen terms and explained with real-life examples.  There is tons and tons of factual information presented, based upon applied linguistic research and the historical growth and transformations of the English language, from its' origins to Old, Middle, and New.

What is Saudi Arabia's relation to the United States in particular and to Western civilization as a whole?  Is it primarily a matter of geopolitics or is it actually a fundamental difference of eclecticism, religion, and ideology due to the influential strains of fundamental Islam and virulent Wahabbism?  Read this book and you can ingest the informational foundations to decide for yourself.  It won't take too much contemplation.  This is a very current and detailed account of what too many are not aware of.  Gold also makes good points on what may be happening in this regions and world in the coming years based up these facts.<br />Wahabbism and it's anti-western civilization hate-promoting are objectively elucidated and supported by factual evidence and cross-referencing.  Transcripts from sermon's from the Mosques of Saudi Arabia are included.  There are numerous sources of documents at the end of the book.    <br />Politically, the ruling family has had a lengthy and for the most part chummy relationship with American administrations over several decades.  It's well known within SA and throughout the world that there are many who oppose the regime within this nation-state on the peninsula.  Keeping the ruling family in power is preferable to what would possibley replace it.  Such are the many nuances and angles of this culturally impervious nation. <br />Home to the religious sites of Mecca and Medina, oil reserves, wealth, and Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia is publicly a protected pseudo-friend of the U.S. yet in actuality is an antagonist of  United States and Western principles of civilization.  Hopefully, the American public and members of Congress will read this book.	2003-03-06

US	52947165	R1EXOJ7NBSO1IX	0895261464	690499814	Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists Criminals & Other Foreign Menaces to Our Shores	Books	5	32	43	N	N	We Will Pay For Our Lack Of Attention	Michelle Malkin takes a badly needed overview and analysis at the critical situation America is in today.  When discussing the issue of illegal immigration and criminals who reside here illegally and commit crimes, oft-times people clutter this issue with unrelated topics concerning illiegal immigration: racism, bias, discrimination, selfishness, etcetera.  This is one of the reasons illegal immigration isn't legislatively and effectively taken head on and dealt with.  It is a serious issue that will have long term ramifications in the United States in the near future.  This is not about legal immigration, the concept of immigration, of which our nation was founded upon.  It is purely the illegals, and the government sanctioned loopholes they use to committ crimes here and Islamic terrorists for example, that work toward killing us, while living here illegally.  <br />Malkin, a first generation American of Filipino immigrants, notes several well-documented cases of criminals who've come here and committed heinous acts with impunity.  Many commit violent crimes, leave, and the return illegally several times.  <BR>The immigration policies of the United States are littered with loopholes and INS ineffectiveness.  The constant snafus of the INS are left unpunished.  Those who drop the ball continue to work without any accountability whatsoever.  A person who enters and resides in the U.S. illegally and has a child, is playing the game.  That child is now a U.S. citizen.  Hospital bills, AFDC (welfare), SSI, and a host of other tax payer funds go to these illegals, who know how to use and abuse the U.S. government generosity (stupidity).  Illegal drain the treasury funds in California, but if people mention this they are immediately tagged with the \\"racist\\" label, and considered incompassionate etc.    <br />Serious reforms are needed.  The author notes that legislation is the solution, which I believe is quite necessary.  However, if the solution is to pass more legislation--to undo the prior legislation that is flawed and is not even executed in the first place we are....adding more legislation, that likely won't be followed or implemented now.  Unless bureaucrats are held accountable. <br />Perhaps I should renounce my U.S. citizenship, leave and return here illegally, apply for welfare, then for a Small Business Administration loan to start my own business.  By taking that route, I'd have a better chance of getting ahead.<br />OVERPOPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES<BR>On a related point to the book, if this trend of immigration continues the population in the U.S. could reach 500 million by 2050, or less.  In 1970 the population was 200 million. In 2003 today, it's 300 million.  Think of the massive concrete-neon sprawl of suburbia, encroaching endlessly up and down both coasts and in the American West.  Resource depletion, pollution, energy needs, higher taxes, and a poorer quality of life.  <br />There will be major negative effects in the U.S. if the current trends continue.  <br />When it comes to immigration, be it legal or illegal, it's the over-population stupid.	2003-03-05

The fervent spend-thrifts who believe in 1984-totalitarianism and fiscally blowing it all for sake of pseudo-caring, even if it destroys a society.  The moribund Soviet Union, Fast-evolving to market PRC, Eastern Europe, and Vietnam among others.  These places now don't want to have freedom but only practice the economic system that's been in existence for more than 5,000 years (It's the market stupid). <br />Lenin created the term \\"useful Idiots,\\" to promote the Bolshevist  agenda. The American mainstream press and university professors have earned that label well.  Add this to poorly read college students and you have \\"useful idiots,\\" who've been duped into buying into contemporary and recent historical revisionism.  It still goes on today, even after the demise of the stupidity of command economics. <br />This reasoning of this book is just as important today as it was during the Cold War, and with the new threats that exist maybe even moreso as we are confronted with enemies that operate with a completely different organizational modus operandi.<br />Charon cites the recent days of our history and notes the importance to remember the brutality and repression of the regimes of the past and the fact that it's a system that has completely failed.  Command bureaucratic economics failed for many reasons.  It has collapsed.  Having spent some time in former communist nations many citizens there have limited knowledge of history because of the censorship and government controlled medias they were exposed to throughout their lives.  And, look at them today: poor, lacking in all resources, and asking for aid from free countries with market economies.  <br />It's really easy to be an idealistic \\"useful idiot,\\" exalting Che, Castro, Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot and other repressors--especially when living in the United States or Western Europe.  Enjoying the right to have free speech, to prosper, the freedom of physical movement and intellectual or philosophical expression.  The freedom to earn income and even save and invest.  For some reason these folks aren't leaving now and they never did.  They'll sit back in the coffee shops in the lap of luxury and talk about an idealism that never was, and never will be.  <br />In the end stupidity has failed, but history also repeats itself.	2003-02-28

Books	5	27	34	N	N	Quest For Justice Symbolically Succeeded	In addition to being a real-life investigative crime solving book, Eagan's descriptive writing in \\"Breaking Blue\\" touched upon many areas that brought the people of the 1930s and this part of the country to life.  The natural beauty of the inland Pacific Northwest in the setting of the Great Depression.  Hobos, gambling, (...), saloons, opium dens, Nez Perce tribe and police corruption.  This work provides a historical glimpse, within its' investigation, which ultimately led to success.  Tony Bamonte, A County Sheriff in Pen Oreille County in eastern Washington state, turned his 500 page Master's Thesis into a murder-case solver.<br />Clyde Ralstin lived a life in the West in some fashion of the Wild Wild West.  After he committed the murder, he was fingered out by a fellow detective in the police department.  The detective was ordered by his superiors to stop the investigation and be quiet.  At the same time, Ralstin left town.  Files on both men \\"disappeared.\\"  But many statements and investigations were all uncovered by Bamonte.  Living out his final years in Montana, Ralstin was aware of the tightening noose around his neck for what he did 54 years before.  The stress and anxiety he experienced, which ultimately help end his life, was the only small amount of justice he received.<br />Some people close to Ralstin actually accused Bamonte of causing trouble and being the problem.  Such is sometimes the twisted loyalty of the blue line, when a member commits wrong doing, even the murder of a fellow police officer.  Ralstin stated, \\"the whole department was crooked back then.  Why are they coming after me?\\"  <br />Bamonte submitted his Master's thesis to his professor at Gonzaga University with trepidation.  Is this 500 page piece of work going to be scoffed at, rejected, or laughed at?  His professor said it was the most intriguing thesis he'd ever encountered.  After some media attention over this 54 year-old local murder case, some turned the tables on Bamonte.During Bamonte's re-election campaign in 1990, the Spokane police chief held 3 press conferences publicly criticizing Bamonte.  Actions like this are unheard of.  Bamonte lost the election.  Why did the the Spokane police chief do this?  Because Bamonte was investigating a similar murder in his jurisdiction.<br />After Clyde Ralstin died 1989, the murder case was closed.	2003-02-24

It's ok to insert one's opinion. Anyone can do what he did.  For those that travel or live as an expat they will relate to the facsination, fury, coveting, scorn, praise, and the resentment toward the United States that is portrayed here.  He wrote what he experienced.  The rest of us have experienced this.  So, we have our in books in our heads.  We simply haven't written them down.  <br />When living in or traveling in other countries, one hears the world's citizens' (non-U.S. citizens) opinions about the American government, its' foreign & trade policies, culture, movies etcetera.<br />THE WORLD WIDE SPREADING OF CULTURAL AMERICANA<BR>T.V. perpetuates many myths as well truths.  No, not every American lives in an enormous house with two luxury cars and a large swimming pool.  Yes, a large part of current American culture focus on celebrities, Jerry Springer, \\"weird things,\\" and shallow action movies.<br />Rosie O'Donnell, Maury Povich, simplistically hollow CNN, fast food chains, MTV, crass-shock advertising, and myopic television sit-coms bombard homes from from Europe to South East Asia, to Tim-Buk-Too.  Is this due purely on behalf of marketing, forcible consumption, or the demand the viewers have for this, that causes it to be spewed around the world?  All of these are factors including more subtle ones not noted.  It's a fact that the most commonly attacked American institutions around the world are fast-food restaurants, not military installations (read \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" by Eric Schlosser).  Today, the major export of the United States is MTV, crass materialism, mindless sit-coms like \\"Baywatch,\\" and corporate brand names. <br />PERCEPTIONS OF AMERICA AND AMERICANS<BR>Quite often, whether in tourist areas or non-touristy parts of the world, I hear the pathetically boring and predictable question: \\"where are you from?\\"  \\"Iam from the U.S. originally,\\" I reply and wait for the steady stream of redundant and shallow questions.  \\"What do you think about this politician or that one, Iraq, or what-have-you.\\"  <br />Many of these people have pre-conceived notions as to what my thought process and opinions are from my nationality.  In sum, these people are making incorrect generalizations and engaging in dangerous stereotyping based upon nationality.  Having not known where I've been, where I live in the world, what I read, I believe in, or my reasoning.  From Hostels in the U.S. Where I lived with mostly Europeans, to Europe to South East Asia, I hear many opinions and complaints (mostly Euro-trash) from people who haven't read much of what they're talking about.  They have very broad and general opinions and beliefs without unbiased reasoning.  <br />The United States is a punching bag for envious Euro-trash, failed communists, and Middle Eastern malcontents because it is now the only Super-power in the world.  Because of this political, military, trade, and economic power, the U.S. draws scorn.  Some of the scorn is rightfully due, while some of it is prejucial. <br />Of the 15 countries Hertsgaard visited, he focused a lot of his time on the opinions of South Africans.  That's fine, but in a country where Aids carriers rape children thinking it will cure them, should we really be concerned with their opinions of us?  I think not. Hertsgaard also spends time and effort discussing the 2002 American Presidential election and undermined the value of his book's quest by inserting his own opinions more than what foreigners thought about the election and the post-election judicial process.  (Most foreigners don't have sufficient knowledge of the American electoral college process, and the judicial and Constitutional concepts behind it--so why put it in the book?)  The author alienates many of his readers by inserting his take on it.  America has never been a democracy.   <br />Like most liberals, Hertsgaard wants to pursue unattainable idealism by having everyone sit down and sip coffee and talk about how much \\"they care,\\" and discuss solutions. Tell that to the people in this world who spend all their time working just to feed their family.  He is the personification of the very Americans he is writing about.   <br />Other related books: \\"The Twilight of American culture, Fast Food Nation (Eric Schlosser), Why Corporations Rule The World, (Steven Korten), No Logo\\" (Naomi Klein).	2003-02-22

This world of wealth, drug use, celebrities, powerful people, LAPD, lies, conniving, deception, world travel and kinky sex, is a real-life look into the debaucherous world of Hollywood that piques the interest.<br />The constant bickering among Madame Alex (died in '95), Ivan Nagy, and Heidi open the doors to this world of raggedy, back-stabbing, shallow people who have the propensity to lie about what they eat for dinner.  But then again, this is L.A.<br />This book is interesting and describes the workings and personalities of this world.  She did make it in her heyday.  From her good family and upbringing in Los Feliz which is in the Hollywood/LA scene to her 1.5 million dollar home she purchased from Michael Douglas in Beverly Hills.  She did it.  Should means justify ends?  <br />What brought her down was her flamboyance, flaunting, and high profile.  She talked too much, and in this industry one must be discreet.  The police don't care about Madames who \\"pander,\\" as long as they keep quiet, and provide information as informants.  Heidi wasn't quiet, and her info. to the police was often incorrect and/or useless.  <br />Now that she has fallen, she can try to sell the experience of this past, because the present for her (like her past) only has old-bags of wind with deep pockets who'll be her meal-ticket.  And today (2003)she's out of her prime even for them.  As Madame Alex said, \\"she wasn't even a 4.5 on a scale of 10,\\" and she sure hasn't improved today.  Mentally, she's still a 16 yr. old who's still selling her a** because that's all she's got--besides this book.  Kudos to Heidi for putting it out.	2003-02-21

Whether a person is apolitical like most Americans, or a D or an R, left, middle or right, one of many questions to ask is not about \\"W\\" but about the American intellect and psyche in general:  Q:  does it matter if a President is not an intellectual?  Is it disturbingly bad, or are there benefits to being poorly read at this particular job, which we do in general believe, wields the most power in the world.  It may or may not.  It depends on the circumstances and occurrences that take place during the particular individual's term.  It also depends on the people this Executive surrounds him with.  This is something the 43rd has by most arguments done fairly well.  That's where the MBA and organizational theory and practice comes into place perhaps.  It also depends on personal conviction to some degree.  The more simple the intellect the more straightforward (and often unwaveringly) the conviction.  Calling Greeks \\"Grecians,\\" not knowing the leader of Pakistan, and not knowing community college grammar does lead one to wonder.  America is not a democracy and never has been.  However today, it's more apparent and accepted by the American people, who are likely oblivious anyway. <br />So, does it matter if a President is not an scholastic nor historical intellectual? (I think no).  The answer in general, is that it all depends.  When it comes to political and policy decision-making, many of the best business minds were not scholars out of MBA business school.  Yet, many of the most terrible business leaders did come out of the MBA programs.  When it comes to decision-making, leadership, legislative acumen, and political abilities, don't look soley nor primarily upon intellect. It can fool you.  <br />He raised more money before the New Hampshire primary than any other individual in the history of American Presidential politics.  Who questioned this?

The variety of concepts in it can help people in sales, in starting their own business, and thinking more carefully of the Risks and Rewards of their actions, whether financial, personal, or professional.  Overcoming self-doubt, fear, negativity, laziness, learning from our failures, and consistently thinking \\"outside of the box,\\" are many things Robert Kiyosaki reminds us of in this piece.  And he's also \\"been there and done it.\\" <br />For Kiyosaki, the concept of failure is important to the learning experience, and what we learn from our failures in life can help us succeed in the future.  Kiyosaki related the failure of his first two businesses and his own self-doubt at a certain period of his life (in the beginning of the book).  He noted this about who his Rich Dad and he think losers are: \\"many losers bet only on sure things....job security, a steady paycheck, garaunteed pension, and interest from a bank account.\\"  another quote: \\"the problem of having a job, is that it gets in the the way of getting rich,\\" his Rich Dad said.  I see this statement as clear and true for not all, but most people.  For example, look around at the people you know.  They've got a \\"job\\" that took up the majority of their mental and physical energy and time.  They bought a home with a mortgage.  Endgame: like a hamster spinning on the wheel.  The illusion of movement.  This person is now the leverage for his/her employer, the one who really makes the money.  <br />Some repeated themes which we should be reminded by is what Kiyosaki stated numerous times in different ways using different real-life examples: \\"What we think is real becomes reality, in most cases\\" (p. 54). He adds that we human beings often try to substantiate and reinforce our beliefs and perceptions of reality.  This can lead to self-defeating behavior and/or missed opportunities to see the opportunities that present themselves in front of us.  \\"One of the most important things to learn is to take control of your reality\\" (p. 54).  If one is a pessimist, has self-doubt, or believes \\"it can't be done,\\" it won't be done.  R.K. reminds us these truisms affect the decisons we make in life.  <br />Throughout the book there is redundancy, but there are mostly positives here. He also incorporates some of the principles of his Cash Flow Quadrant in this piece.  He has the reader fill in a list of things that the reader loves/hates.  Also important is the constant need to ask and answer \\"why\\" you are doing anything in life.  Not the \\"how\\" you do it, but the \\"why.\\"  He correctly asserts that if you know \\"why\\" you you can then focus your energies on the \\"how.\\"  R.K. sheds light on how bad believing in a 401k, and mutual funds is.  This is a practical common-sense guide and a positive motivator.  Read this to keep yourself continually thinking \\"outside the box.\\"	2003-02-15

This latest book by Gore Vidal has highlighted and investigated many things the Federal government is doing today that perhaps not enough Americans are discussing at the moment (post 2002).  As a result of what occurred in 2002, many fundamental operations, as well as the outright constitutional philosophy, have changed in the U.S. In addition to this governmental metamorphosis in the U.S. many individuals, beauracratic agencies, and corporations have benefitted tremendously from 9/11.  Many will benefit from a regime change in Iraq.  There are many angles to look at but people should be aware of 1. who benefits 2. how they benefit, and 3. why they benefit.<BR>  <BR>An incremental and consistent eroding of the Bill of Rights, and *successfull* attempts to eliminate such judicial precedents e.g., the \\"Exlusionary Rule\\" are a slippery slope that began in the latter part of the 20th Century.  Federal, state, and local police agencies have increased their power to alarmingly enormous levels as a result of 2002.  These encroachments (i.e, the Total Information Awareness Act, which may falter) focuses on ALL Americans, and not on the false premise that these new powers will be used exlusively to investigate terror suspects, who of course, need to be consistently found out and quashed.<br />Like the Cold War, and the War on Drugs, the State is feeding off of 9/11 like a body builder on steroids.	2003-02-06

Yet, proportional per capita spending on luxury goods has increased significantly.  The results according to this author and others who've conducted numerous studies and research is a weaker economy, high personal debt, longer working hours, less sleep, and having to work until death, in debt of course.   <br />We're all aware of the American \\"gotta have this or that\\" bug.  Many have it, but many don't.  Some don't want it.  Why do certain luxury goods and \\"gadgets\\" become oh-so-popular in American society?  Frank notes, and correctly, that the desire for many to purchase certain material things is by no-doubt influenced by what others are buying or want to buy.  <br />The concept of \\"social status\\" is a concept where human beings in  mass-consumption cultures judge each other in this context in RELATION to our peers.  These \\"peers\\" may be the strangers we live next to in suburban anonymity, our co-workers, friends, or the strangers we see driving next to us in our daily suburban traffic jams.  (Note my use of the word \\"stranger\\").  <br />The commonly known terms such as \\"keeping up with the Joneses,\\" the status treadmill\\" the \\"arms race of consumerism, Consumer Feticism,\\" and Velben's \\"Conspicuous Consumption\\" are presented.  But not from a moralistic standpoint but a behaviorist, biological, psychological, and an economic standpoint.  <br />The first part of the book informs us about many things we already aware of but expands upon it through the various academic fields already noted above.  The second part of the book is the \\"solution part.\\"  What the author thinks can be done to change the current pattern.  Here's where it can get sticky for some.  The solution Frank offers from his research is a thesis on Human Behaviour, and he proposes a \\"political-economic\\" solution: taxing consumption.  The solution is the part of this work that leads to the economic analysis of the \\"hypothetical\\" once again, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Although theoretical, the first part is interesting, and the second part may be for some.	2003-02-03

It's written in an easy-to-read straightforward approach.  Some or all of this technique can be applied to get the results a person wants.  By using this method you will see results quickly.  I saw them after 2 workouts (some peoples' bodies make noticeable changes quicker than others.)<br />I do think that some cardio is important for metabolism, cleaning out the heart to prevent arthero-sclerosis.  It's true that cardio workouts allow the body to break down fats in an an aggressively healthier way up to 12 hours after a cardio workout.  Instead of being &quot;all or nothing&quot; with one's attitude to cardio it can still remain a matter of degree if one wants it to.  From this book and the Zickerman approach, Some people can forgo cardio completely, some can reduce it slightly, significantly, or do the the same amount of cardio as before this method, while increasing/changing your strength-training from none-at-all, to some Zickerman, moderate Zickerman or completely to Zickerman's Power Of Ten approach.<br />This will work for those who get bored at the gym quickly, don't like working-out, don't have the time, or want to change their workout style while obtaining the results wanted.  When people become committed to getting in shape they often have to spend the time to shape their schedules and life around the gym, AND spend the time it takes to commute to and back from the gym.  Not under this system.  It will work undoubtedly best for those who have access to a gym and its' nautilus equipment.  Zickerman details how one can do this method at home, but the results will be better from the machines at the gym which can allow more proper form and more varied focus on particular muscle groups (just my opinion).    <br />The ever-present and omnipotent addendum is in this book like all others: eating patterns.  Yes, your eatinghabits greatly affect your physical health, and Zickerman's eating approach is one of practical, realistic, and plain common sense.  Use your head (and your fork and spoon wisely) and you'll do OK.  There are not strict patterns to follow, nor revolutionary eating admonishons here.  You don't have to count calories too much, or eat special ingredients or munch on food in particular combinations.  <br />There are many programs out there.  We are constantly inundated by them.  In contrast to the other books on the market at the moment, Zickerman provides more explanations and directions on how to apply the workout, while the other book spends a good deal of time on research, and how the body does what it does biologically, and nutritionally under the the slow work-out process.  This system works.	2003-01-31

Exactly What You Want To Do	This is not a self-help book and shouldn't be.  It's simply a book for people (not me) who have been doing the same job or living the same lifestyle in the same environment for a while to take an assessment.  An assessment to make sure it's in the person's best interest to live the way we are living.  This book describes a common feeling that many people feel to varying degrees.  More or less, most of us ask ourselves at times: what am I doing with my life?  Where am I headed?  Is this my passion, or am I missing out on what I really should be doing in life?  In addition to career, these questions can be about our relationships with family and friends, significant others, or if we simply living geographically where we want to be living.  <br />The author Po Bronson, appears to place high emphasis on career and &quot;career success&quot; in particular.  The people he writes about as examples may seem to some to be on the so-called upper-crust of society but that's entirely irrelevant.  These are examples of people who made changes because they wanted to:  that is success in itself.  If you're doing exactly what you want to do in life, and you're living your life exactly how you want to, you are a bona-fide success.  And no one can take that away from you.  No one.  I believe if a person does what they truly enjoy then they are doing the right things in their life.  <br />If a person feels that there is &quot;more out-there&quot; to achieve or experience in career, living, life, education etcetera, then they should do some careful consideration, accept the consequences of calculated risk, and then: DO IT!  Last time I checked, we only live once.<br />90% or more of people are averse to change.  Once people get into a &quot;routine&quot; it brings about the &quot;comfort zone.&quot;  This can bring financial, social, and psychological &quot;security.&quot;  There is nothing wrong with that, but the comfort zone can lead a person to forget the many alternatives and choices that they have in all areas life.

Today many are realizing they didn't monitor, change, or properly allocate some of their funds.  Obviously, many will depend on them in the future.  401Ks <BR>are also mutual funds, as well as the traditional and Roth IRA, the 403b among others.  Since so many are participating and people will continue to pour billions of dollars into them, the beginning individual mutual fund holder should have this book.  <br />It will primarily benefit those who are new to mutual funds or those who want to increase their general knowledge.  Simple, precise explanations.  Explanations on proper and true diversification, rates and risk of return, asset allocation, and appropriate risk based upon one's attitude, age, and stomach.  It tells one how to look at how a particular fund operates and what it's invested in.  Terms such as diversification, dollar-cost averaging, and the fact that past performance is no guarantee of future results are usually known to those who've followed mutual funds already.  It is good to understand and calculate the true \\"cost\\" of a fund.  Declining backend loaded funds are o.k. in solid performing funds that an individual will hold for a period of 5 yeas or more.  But does one know if they are gong to be in a fund for five years?  When a new fun manager takes over the operations and asset allocation of a fund, it is important to note how and where there may be changes.  Know the difference between a micro, small, medium, and large cap index fund.  How is a cap defined?  Know the difference between a balance, value, international, emerging market, index, and global fund.  Global fund?  That means most of the investment allocation is overseas right?  Nope.  Often, most of the fund's holdings are in domestic (American) companies which means the global fund may have the same holdings as your U.S. blue chip, or more domestically oriented funds.  Owning more mutual funds, and even funds in different families, means the more diversification correct?  No.  One can achieve the same diversification with 7 funds as 17.  Even moreso.

The focus is to go slow yet also be comprehensive.  Our bad habits can't be shoved under the rug in a day.  The initial enthusiasm for those partaking in other &quot;new&quot; programs and fads wanes if one denies themselves of this-and-that, and forces one to eat or drink that-and-this.   How long does that usually last?  You can answer that yourself.  The purchase price of this book will help you if you're serious, and save you a lot more than videos, &quot;new&quot; workout equipment or everyday gimmicks we're bombarded with by the Diet Industry.<br />Focusing on sound, proven, and common-sense nutritional principles, Change One offers the healthiest and most wholistic guide to health AND weight loss that's been produced in some time.  In contrast to those who advocate ramming fat and protein down our throats, not eating before noon, or spending money on the &quot;Hollywood diet shake.&quot;  <br />Under Change One, a person doesn't have to deny themselves everything of what they like, but moderation is important, like everything in life.  One can eat out in restaurants at times and there are recommendations on ordering a variety of things so as not to sabotage your progress.  There is also a self-assessment guide to give you a look into what your habits are.  Hastings takes a not-at-all-boring-approach to caloric intake, portions, adjusting the kitchen to good eating, stress relief, and exercise, which are all components to healthy living.  If being healthy and of optimal weight is important to a person they should take it seriously.  Other programs sell quick-fixes, gimmicks, and defeatist magic tricks that only focus on one aspect of weight-loss and often times are detrimental to our health rather than helpful.	2003-01-21

This can be of great value for those who don't honestly &quot;like&quot; exercising, or don't have the time because of a hectic schedule.  It's true that in 8 minutes a day, you can change your body.  The key is using the eight minutes in the most optimal way possible.  This is where Cruise helps us.  He gives us the roadmap that is most optimal for the time alloted (eight minutes per day or more of course). The eight minutes a day is the physical fitness (workout) part of this program.  Daily aerobic and strength training.  There is a daily focus on two separate muscle groups. The workout part is the drive to do what many are aware of: adding more muscle stimulates metabolism.  When it comes to diet certain fats are good and others bad and obstructive to one's physical goals.<br />Beyong the 8 minutes: eating.  What you eat, how many calories you take in, and the type of fats you absorb via fork and spoon.   Portions here are critical.  Because of this, if you are the type of person who's tried other &quot;diets&quot; or &quot;workout programs&quot; before this, you'll likely diss it after a while and then move onto the next one.  Be realistic about this.  Calorie intake is restrictive and one's eating habits are actually more important than the 8 minutes a day workout, if you want to get the results this program offers.  The supportive &quot;pep talks&quot; and the easy tracking make it convenient for those who are one, motivated to do it, and two, don't have a lot of time.  It will work, if you follow it.	2003-01-21

The type of folks that hike the Appalachian Trail are unique individuals in general.  Bryson looks into the their motivations, lives, and the mutual experiences he has with the folks he runs into on the AT, as well as the people in the small communities they visit just off the trail.  A lot of historical background, logistics, and politics about the AT are presented.  Who created it, why and how it was done, and the philosophy of the AT.  It is the longest continuous trail in the world.  <br />The author did a lot of homework and gives statistical notes and expository information on animal species, flora and fauna, the environment, plate techtonics, geology of the rocks, bureaucratic policies, and ways to keep from gettin' eaten by a bear.  There are a lot of vivid depictions of the woody places they walk through as well as the mentality such an undertaking brings to one psychologically.  <br />THE GOVERNMENT STUPIDITY<br />As usual, when it comes to government....<br />For its celebration of its 75th anniversary, the National Park Service lavishly spent $500,000 taxpayer dollars on its one and only party in Vail, Colorado.  At the same time it was slashing budgets, closing facilities, and laying-off park Rangers.  In addition to this egregious act there numerous other examples of this  disgraceful bureaucratic organization, that actually destroys the environment of U.S. national parks instead of preserving them.<br />Also: the United States National Forest has 378,000 miles of roads in American's National Forests.  It is eight times the total mileage of the entire U.S. interstate system.  It is also the largestroad system in the world controlled by a single body.  The Forest Service has the second largest number of road engineers of any government organization on Earth.  By the middle of the 21st Century, the goal of this bureaucracy is to construct 580,000 miles of roads in total.  <br />Sound like typical government logic?  Creating jobs.  Keeping jobs for those already on the federal payroll.  Getting more funds from taxpayers and wastefully spending them to justify the organization's existence.  And more importantly, to continually request for increased budget appropriations.  When it comes to government, even a pine tree isn't safe.<br />The U.S. Forest Service is in cahoots with--you guessed it--the timber industry.  150 million acres of forest is reserved by the Forst Service for the timber industry to clear cut and profit from.  It is a fact that in the 1980s, the U.S. Forest Service was the only organization in the U.S. that was cutting more trees down that it was replacing.<br />In one business deal, the National Forest service sold 100 year old lodgepole pines in the Targhee National Forest in Idaho for $...dollars each.  But it spent $...dollars per tree in survees, contract writing, and--yes--building roads to get to them.  <br />Again, when it comes to government, (and corporations) even a pine tree isn't safe.	2003-01-05

How has the role of different sociological groups such as women, teenagers, and the elderly changed?  How has these shopping patterns affected society?  Many retailers depend on the fourth quarter (christmas shopping) to make a profit at all.  What is the second largest shopping bonanza after Christmas?  Surprisingly, it's the &quot;Back to School&quot; onslaught.  <br />I hear a lot of Americans complain, and rightfully so, about the crass materialism, long lines, jammed parking lots, and frenzied rude shoppers every Christmas.  &quot;I'm tired of it all, it's too much,&quot; people tell me.  &quot;The spirit of it all is lost,&quot; they add.  And yet this year in 2002, Americans forked out 110 Billion dollars for the christmas holiday.  Glad I've spent the last three christmas holidays outside the United States.  Hopefully, this will continue.	2003-01-03

The only time she shed a tear was when her (married) son kicked the bucket because of his bad heart while in the sack with another lady.  After he croaked she then basically ex-communicated her daughter-in-law, and her grandchildren.   <br />Also according to the story, her personal assistant who was often at her side, was asked to wipe her shoes clean with a rag like a shoe-shine boy, in front of people.  She also liked to snap her fingers at people when she wanted things brought to her, or wanted someone to do something for her.  <br />Then there's Mr. Helmsley.  Another multi-millionaire with ample business acumen who lacked street smarts and contemporary social skills. (Doh! Where ya been Harry?)  Leona set the trap: after their affair had schemingly precipitated to deeper emotional depths over time, the queen told Mr. H that another man had offered to marry her, and she showed him a fake diamond engagement ring he allegedly bought for her.  None of this was true.  But Harry fell for it.  Leona made an ultimatum that it was now or never.  All or nothing.  She was not going to be the second banana in his life.  The queen persuaded Harry to leave his wife of 33 years for her.  He soon discovered what he was in for: a clingy nagger.      <br />This is New York.  He was a very wealthy man.  He could have simply called a guy in Queens or Brooklyn named \\"Vito,\\" and for about $50,000 her could have had her....but no.  He put up with her because he was P-whipped. <br />Leona is gutsy and to the bone, and nothing ventured means nothing gained in life.  But, the queen turned ambition into a sadistic perversion of making people miserable to inflate her ego.  There are assertions that this was out of emotional neglect, or lack of emotional support from her mother when she was a child.  Leona's mother, it seems favored Leona's older sister.  Let's call out Dr. Freud, May, Rogers, Adler, or Phil McGraw.  <br />After she schemed to marry and control Mr. Helmsley, she made all clear that she had the power to hire, buy, intimidate, and fire anyone at will.  Before she nabbed Harry, her first major promotion in real-estate sales was a result of a performance on the casting couch with her boss who had the power and ability to promote her within Mr. H's company.   <br />One tid-bit the author noted, was that part of her advertising promotion for one of her major hotels was to have a full deck of cards with 52 different pictures of her on each of them them.  When the advertising company returned with the finished sample, previously approved by Leona, she snapped.  She wanted the cards bigger, (bigger than regulation cards), and with gold edging.  One by one she threw each one on the floor, and then told the advertising representatives, \\"have you ever played 52-pick-up.  Now pick them up.\\"<br />In her late 70s now, with time running out and Harry six-feet deep, the \\"queen of mean\\" recently donated a million dollars to a Christian organization for the \\"disadvantaged.\\"  She claims she did this not to improve her image, but because it was the \\"right thing to do.\\"  You fill in the blanks.  The Queen hasn't got her Karma--yet.  Her 4 year gig in the pen was heavily reduced.	2002-12-27

M.B.A. schools usually.  Students with strong academic skills with the honored M.B.A. can do the accounting, statistical work, and market research analysis.  But does that mean they have a \\"business mind,\\" or good \\"business sense?\\"  Absolutely not.  (That's why a new test is being devised to determine the \\"common sense\\" abilities of MBAs). Gates is a perfect example of the many successful business people who didn't spend time in front of Ph.ds in ivory towers regurgitating \\"business theories and paradigms.\\"    <br />A look into the technological and mainly business side of Microsoft, the author breaks down the organization into the \\"how's, why's, and what's\\" of MSFT.<br />It's common knowledge that Gates is a genius in the technical realm,  and MSFT is a behemoth organization that has the majority of market share.  But how did Microsoft grow to where it is and thrive in this ever-changing and competitive industry?  This book explains the business (more than technical) philosophy, model, and actual examples from products and projects.  Interviews with former and current managers and employees are also included.      <br />Again, it's common knowledge that Gates is exceptional at business.  Ask their competitors.  Note that Steve Jobs had a better product that was on the market earlier but he lacked the business, marketing, and management acumen.  Gates not only seeks out brilliant techno minds but considers their business sense equally important, and this is heavily weighed when he decides to hire prospective candidates.  Those hired are also individualists who will challenge him and other superiors, and argue and debate with him, in the search for the best idea or model.  An employee gets Gate's respect, the author writes, \\"when his employees yell back.\\"  If Bill is converted by their arguments as opposed to his, he likewise changes course, taking the best route.  <br />One of the most dangerous and damaging things to a company, and any organization, are \\"yes men.\\"  A company culture that rewards the \\"yes man/woman\\" mentality leads people to misrepresent themselves and their work, and the managers and ownership eventually become \\"out of the loop.\\"  This leads to uninformed decisions, cover-ups, resentment, and alienation that benefit no one.  <br />This is written for the laymen, but can be a bit dry.  Things such as shipping strategies, keeping teams small on projects, constant self analysis and critiques, and the reliance on customer feedback, are some of the many interlinking factors of the organization.  The company likes people and departments that are interdependent upon one another to be physically close to one another. I.e., in the same building or on the same property, so if there is a problem or a need for clarification, they can see each other face to face to discuss it, instead of swapping emails, voicemails, and engaging in converence calls from across the country.  Again, it's common knowledge that a major tenet of MSFT is to find out where the industry is going in the future, become the leader, and provide products with such strong quality that they become the \\"industry standard.\\"  The author even provides some organization charts to pin-up on your wall.  <br />Not The Bad And The Ugly<br />The point of this book was to focus on the positives.  The strategies and models that make the company pre-eminant.  What is not in the book is: the common claim that the company is a monopoly, engages in unfair business practices, and limits the choice of consumers by ramming its product down their throats.  There have been numerous charges and lawsuits that MSFT treats employees poorly.  This company hires a lot of temps, work them overtime, plays with them, and then discards them.  For the positives, read this book.   For information on the not-so-great things about this organization, there are plenty of other books to read.	2002-12-24

Moon travel beats the major competitor (the main travel-trail eye-sore creator) in almost all respects, but not all. <br />Moreso than other travel guides, the Moon travel guide for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia has tons and tons of recent political, social and economic history in addition to significant cultural notes that a visitor *must* be aware of. (i.e., what does a South East Asian smile mean?) The maps of the cities and provinces are excellent. the all-important overland border-crossings between 'Nam, Laos, and Cambo are cleary marked. This is one of the many reasons that Moon can't be beaten at the moment. This guide's overland itineraries are the best. Example: you want to go into China overland fron northern Vietnam. How can you get up to Kunnming, China? It tells ya. And, we learn, that the one way flight into Bangkok from Kunming is the same price as the one that flys from Hanoi. (This price equality of course must be verified). <br />The information regarding the pricing and existence of certain establishments that cater to travelers is outdated. However, where to eat or sleep has never been an important part of a book anyhow, just the general information about the area in general and how to get there is all a visitor needs. Does someone need to read a guidebook to decide specifically where to eat? Where to specifically sleep? If it does for you, do everyone a favor: stay home. <br />The underlying story that provides the \\"general-informational\\" foundation is enough. When we come through town, understandably we don't know much, but that is far better than knowing absolutely nothing at all, which is quite common now from my conversations with tourists, and especially now among \\"backpackers.\\" The purpose of why backpacking started has been lost for most.  <br />By the way, it is a fact that the communist government censors this guidebook. I found that out trying to pick it up at the post office.  Well worth having.	2002-12-21
US	52947165	R1R1KYVJT77VU5	0679767495	771111727	In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Historical Look Inside Memos and Minds	There are numerous verbatim copies of memos that were exchanged between President Johnson, the civilian (state and defense departments), and many military officials involved in this long-drawn out, lengthy period.  From these memos, McNamera explained the circumstances, strategy, and thinking behind himself and others in the political, historical, and Cold War context of the time.<br />He repeatedly (in my ignorant opinion) took honest and objective attempts to highlight and elucidate the (by his own admission many cases of faulty) reasoning behind why forces were there in the first place, and why escalation continued throughout the 1960s.  Many Southeast Asian political factors external to Vietnam were factors in the decision to enter, escalate, and proceed, as the U.S. military did in this conflict.  <br />Some factors were:  Sukarno in Indonesia (who was later toppled), Mao Zedong's promotion of \\"perpetual world-wide struggle through revolution,\\" the Domino Theory (which we now know as false, but then it was difficult to know), among many other Cold War events that took place in the decade of the 1960s.  The Cuban Missile Crisis, construction of the Iron Curtain, airlifts to Berlin, Khrushchev stating \\"we will bury you,\\" and the mistakenly held perception that there was a \\"Sino-Soviet\\" pact, when in fact, the two didn't like each other.  <br />McNamera noted  more than once that there were no \\"experts\\" on Vietnam and Southeast Asian historical, culture, and contemporary politics.  They often consulted \\"experts\\" on the Soviets, Chinese, and other adversaries, who were often proved to be correct and were vital to the formulation and implementation of foreign and military policy.  In Vietnam they chose to have no \\"experts\\" to turn to who knew the people.  As McNamera noted, he and the military and administration didn't know very much at all about Vietnam, and its' history.  <br />A major point McNamera commonly stated was the perception of Ho Chi Minh by senior American political and military officials.  Was Ho Chi Minh: 1.  a nationalist who wanted to unify his country and expel foreigners who had subjugated Vietnam for hundreds of years (who also happened to be a communist, in the likes of Tito, independent of Peking and Moscow), or was he 2.  A communist, who was promulgating Vietnamese unification under communism not only in Vietnam but also in neighboring South Eastern Asian nations.  3.  A part of both or neither of 1. or 2.  The answer now leans toward number 1. quite heavily.  Should they have been aware of this then?  McNamera says \\"yes.\\"    <br />Although their decisions were terrible an important thing for the reader to be constantly be aware of is: the context of when these thoughts, strategies, and actions took place.  The 1960s were from a  radically different world than that of today.  One can't even imagine, if compared to 2003.  The 1960s were the most intense decade during the Cold War.  Presently, to make more than a couple of assumptions or critiques of the decisions made back during the conflict can easily (although not necessarily)lead to the comparison of \\"apples & oranges.\\"<br />McNamera probably wanted to expunge himself of some of the blame he's often been given by history regarding the disastrous foreign policy-making in Vietnam that still is referred to by some as \\"McNamera's War.\\" This is in part, but not entirely, true of course.  Pointing mainly and/or only to McNamera is big-time oversimplification.  <br />How interesting it is that a civilian intellectual Auto Executive can all of a sudden become Secretary of Defense in a single day.  After getting a phone call from JFK and receiving Kennedy's job offer, McNamera replied he wasn't qualified to be Secretary of Defense, whereas JFK rhetorically asked \\"who is?\\"  The rest is history: go figure. <br />Communists are indeed rotten autocratic people who've failed miserably.  Communism, Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism was the biggest mistake ofthe 20th Century.  Yes, if the Pentagon bureaucrats and civilian leaders had simply read a couple of books on Vietnamese history they might have had a more balanced view of the objectives of the Viet Minh, NVA, and let the chips fall where they knew they were going long before Saigon fell.	2002-12-18
US	52947165	R25TS04S2FJU8O	1558505296	236695143	Investment Biker: Around the World With Jim Rogers	Books	5	54	63	N	N	Keep Rollin' Jim....	This is a travel book, not a financial book, period.  It's 90% travel to 10% international finance/investment 101.  And it's interesting because Jim gives us a glimpse of the current, recent and distant-pasts of these exotic and intriguing places he visits on his motorcycle journey which spanned 22 months.  He didn't look up influential people in the places he visited.  He writes about his conversations and experiences from people he \\"bumped into\\" during his trip.  That's where one learns what a place is really like.  He also \\"put his bike down\\" a couple of times, and spent a lot of time wrenching on it.  He's no schlep.  <br />A success on Wall Street, he has a lot of knowledge about many different parts of the world in a historical, and \\"future possiblility\\" sense in the political, economic, and cultural context.  Because his experiences on this journey, which comprise this book were penned in the early 1990s, the reader can: see if Jim was right about his take on the future of these nations.  Overall he's on track.  <br />For example, the rise of Islamic extremism in poor Islamic countries that have been left behind in the technological advances and globalization of the planet.  Religious resurgences in the former Soviet republics, the lack of common sense and wastefulness of the communistic system, and the then-and-now shrinking of our world via telecommunications, freer international trade, regulations, technology, and business/trade agreements.    <br />For the ten-percent of the book that discusses general international investment, for the layman he discusses U.S. Gold and monetary policy, that are short and easy to read, as well as basic Monetary policy and Macro-economic functions.  How does someone buy and sell currency?  What do folks look for when the invest in a nation?  Why do some countries have currency and foreign exchange controls?  And, what are the positives and negatives of these monetary policies?    <br />One historical insight Jim noted on his long trek across Russia and the former Soviet republics on his bike is that communism and Stalin in the Soviet Union were greatly helped by the invasion of Germany in WWII.  Hypothetical of course, but what if Germany hadn't attacked the USSR which led to the deaths of 1/6th of the Soviet  population?  The invasion, loss of life, hardship and subsequent \\"heroic\\" victory helped the USSR substantially.  In addition to defeating the Germans, the Soviet's victory meant the subjugation of Eastern Europe, which enabled it to extract its resources and industries which the USSR didn't immenselyviously this helped Stalin tyrannical.  How long would Stalin's tyannical murder spree, with his own people starving in the 1920s, have lasted with out it?  His forever-lasting economic policies were not sound, as we found out in 1991.  With the subsequent victory in '45, he was a \\"hero.\\"  The glue that held this  multi-ethnic and geographically gargantuan empire together until is collapse in 1991.<br />Many of his insights about where the U.S. economy and culture are headed are worthy of being considerate of.  In the last several decades the U.S. currency has lost a full 1/3 of its value.  Why?  What is the result, both good and bad?  Find out here.  Jim also notes, from a rational investor standpoint that the American economy is past its glory days, and like every other nation or culture in history it will diminish in the same likes of the British and Roman Empires as examples.  According to Jim, it has already begun.  The world changes. Demographics change. Cultures and populations change over time.  Our world and its history culturalism and not static.    <br />Multi-cultralism: good, right?  Wrong.  We simply don't know.  It hasn't worked anywhere else in the world.  It may very well (or may not) cause a lot of problems in the United States in the future  after we're dead.  Multi-culturalism is a natural demographic historical process that has affected, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Italy, Rwanda, Switzerland, Nigeria, China, Canada, and Latin America (among many more).  Americans are too myopic to realize what ethnic, linguistic, and geographical \\"nationalism\\" can become over decades and centuries.  He points out correctly the deep similarities of the folks in Alaska, the Yukon Territories, and Pacific Northwest in the U.S.  What does the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia have in common with DC and Ottawa?  Not much.  But they do have much in common with each other.  <BR> <BR>He explained some international investment and financial models, so the layman can understand what he's saying.  It's a presursor to an International finance/investment Intro class.  This is why it's not a financial book.  Many of his friends at \\"Worth\\" and \\"Money\\" magazine, and Wall Street (even Peter Lynch), gave a sound-bite for this book.  But it won't attract the type of folks who'd read it, because it's a Travel Book and travelers read travel books, not investment books (generally speaking).  So, why is Lynch's \\"Beating the Street\\" put in the same category as \\"Investment Biker?\\"  Because the person in charge apparantley hasn't studied much Marketing....<br />He's gotta a biker-like name, Jim Rogers.  He's wearing a leather jacket and chaps and has a smile on his face in the company of a good looking girlfriend.  After he returned home from this trip, he drove his motorbike to Alaska.  He's a biker at heart and schrewd investor in mind.  Jim and Pirsig out to get together.  Boy, wouldn't that be a book?	2002-12-14

The scenario is predictable and the general themes are known to the reader by page 30. And with Grish that's OK. Michael Brock is a young lawyer living in Georgetown and working for the prestigious law firm of Drake & Sweeney: the ambitious climb up the corporate law firm ladder, a high income, a wife he never sees in an unhappy dysfunctional marriage and 80 hour work-weeks, are broken up by martini lunches billed to clients.  Grisham again presents the \\"lawyerly atmosphere,\\" with layman descriptions of legalese and strategies, in an interesting and intriguing way as the story unfolds. The descriptions of the District of Columbia are true-to-the-heart, and bring you to its Victorian townhouses, bad parts of town, popular night-spots, \\"lettered\\" streets, and DC's restaurants and cafes. <br />Even though he's a lawyer who lives in D.C., Brock goes through a personal, professional, and spritual metamorphosis after a traumatic incident--but all in 32 days?  Now, Acknowledging a boring existence in life, through introspection, he has a series of conscious-raising revelations as the result of event.  <br />He then ventures out to fight for the needy. Those who don't have a voice. Those who have multiple self-induced problems, make mistakes in life, and screw-up on a regular basis. Illegitimate children, dependence on drugs and the habitual inability to keep a job: these are the people who are the victims. And, these are victims who need justice.  These people need a voice in society for theirs' is muted in the mahogany and oak halls of justice. And, Brock will be the man: risking his freedom, life, high income, career, and a certain future as a million-dollar-partner in his law firm that he leaves. <br />He chucks it. <br />For spiritual enlightenment perhaps. White guilt. Lawyer guilt. He gets a divorce. He marches with the homeless of D.C.  He moves into a furniture-less loft in Adams-Morgan, buys a clunker of a car, and eats out in cheap restaurants he describes as \\"run by Pakistanis\\". And, all this, at the bewilderment and dismay of his white-collar judgemental yuppie family. <br />Although I'm no cynic, as I read this story, and am inundated by its general stereotypes we see in our media everyday, I picture this: Tom Cruise on a crusade....growing a 3-day stubble, wearing a loose tie, blue-jeans and sneakers, while he helps the \\"disadvantaged\\" as a street lawyer on a crusade for justice against the bad guy dapper-dons adorned in Hermes suits. Larry King prime-time is next for Michael Brock. <br />This has \\"movie screenplay\\" written all over it. Thematic expressions of good guy under-dog David the protaganist, versus the Goliath nemesis of Drake and Sweeney, the antagonist. The fight for justice. To right a wrong.  David vs. Goliath--and David triumphing.  Perhaps some suburban cul-de-sac liberals will feel they aren't donating enough of their years-old canned food from their suburban gated community cupboards. (Volunteering is out of the question--they don't have time.) The sensitive may shed a tear.  First year law students who are clueless will trick themselves into believing they'll be a pro bono lawyer after law school for a couple of months after they read this book, before they completely forget about it. Hollywood will be shooting this one down the road. Once again, film-makers who live in Malibu will feel good about themselves after they call this one a \\"wrap.\\"	2002-12-07

Who were these mysterious folks who wore cut-off jeans, cowboy hats, and sunglasses?  A very interesting documentary about this secret operation.  If a pilot was shot down they were to take shellfish poison and commit suicide, because officially, they didn't exist.  What country is the most-bombed per capita in history of the world?  Vietnam?  No, Laos.  There are frequent insights and descriptions into the personalities of this small group of daring people who took part in this widely unknown conflict and series of secret missions.  It lasted 10 years.  Military terminology, procedures, strategies, and informalities (the way things got done), are explained well in this book.  The personalities, internal politics and military strategies within Laos of the U.S. military and political bureaucracy, and Viet Minh, are broken down in an easy-to-read and free-flowing way, that makes it interesting and enjoyable for the reader.  Some battles were examined that most of the American public is still not aware of today.   <br />There is a lot of information and real-life examples about endless catch-22-like SOPs and regulations that bound those who served in the Vietnam and the \\"other theater,\\" (Laos).   <br />Common expressions explained throughout the book explain what it meant when someone \\"went bamboo,\\" or took a hit from the \\"golden BB.\\"  What is a \\"FAC\\" or a \\"REMF.\\"  Vets will be impressed when a civilian mentions these acronyms.<br />Like in Vietnam, the American military bureaucrats (suits) in downtown Vientiene offices were unaware and out-of-touch, yet, they were the ones creating and enforcing the rules and regulations, but not participating in the conflict.  Therefore, they really didn't know what was going, and couldn't relate to the folks who put their life on the line every time they hopped in their officially non-existent jalopy.  What is it like to realistically know that today may be your last day?  Every day?  <br />The picturesque and mystical description of Laos and its' people make one want to go there and see it for their own eyes.  Thoses interested in history, foreign policy, and South East Asia in general will learn from and enjoy this book, which should be more well-known.	2002-11-27

We should not judge a book by its cover--or title--but: I believe the title of the book doesn't reveal what it is about, and that it may appear to the non-Halberstam-knowing populace to be another generic current event or recent poli-sci book for the new release section of the book store.  This, it is not.  This is an interesting, nicely written piece from the first to last page.  <br />The concept of how foreign policy issues can occur overnight for an administration and can help or hurt it is logically and \\"politically\\" enumerated.  The imagery behind certain foreign policy stances is often more important than if the outcome was indeed successful or not.  An administration doesn't have very much control over post-cold-war foreign policy dilemmas because of the numerous foreign factors that exist that are beyond an administrations control.  Foreign policy can be a helper or a killer, and a lot of the issues that confront us in the post-cold war are less-definable, obviously.  <br />For the casual observer (me) or the policy wonk, this book provided ample amounts of refreshing and new information about he people, personalities, events, personal relationships, and domestic and foreign policy-making of the of the late 1980s and entire 1990s.  As the relevant precursor--Vietnam--many of the military debacles of the 1970s influenced military and civilian policy makers and their subsequent decisions (obviously) in the 1990s, greatly influencing their decisions (American foreign policy) in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda.  Why were we in Somalia?  Why did we want to restore Aristide to the bottom-of-the-barrel garbage can of Haiti?  You'll find out why from this book.  The Rwandan genocide was more efficient than the Nazi exterminations if one looked at it from a per capita number killed - divided by - the time it took (to eradicate \\"the other\\" point of view.)  <br />Many policy makers and players from the past and recent present are noted.  Many \\"mini-biographies\\" on the following people in this book examen their personal lives and professional careers, which are very interesting.  Zbignew Brzezenski, Cyrus Vance, Eagleburger, Reich, Les Aspin, \\"Wools\\", Rubin, Howe, \\"old Henry,\\" Schultz, Tony Lake, Powell, Baker, Christopher, Stephanothingness, Albreight, Holbrooke, Shalikashvili, Scowcroft and Milosivic among others.  Lloyd Bentsen's life was interesting enough to have me looking for his biography.  <br />The Gulf War is covered, and the most influential person that brought the new technology mentality to the U.S. armed forces:  Colonel John Warden.  Schwarzkopf and Powell, who swooned typically ignorant Americans on T.V. got the credit for doing what in this 4-day campaign?  Then Schwarzkopf writes a book entitled \\"It Doesn't Take A hero.\\"  The book should have been titled, \\"It Didn't Need A General.\\"  <br />The Bosnian calamity and it's foreign and domestic political implications for the Clinton administration cover mammoth portions of this book.

US	52947165	RC26CEH4Q1G8Z	0743223233	692090769	War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Influences, Actions, Players, and Over-View	Halberstam is brilliant in the way he can narrate<BR>and explain events, and illustrate people's motivations and actions.  We should not judge a book by its cover--or title--but: at risk of being a \\"stickler,\\" I believe the title of the book doesn't reveal what it is about, and that it may appear to the non-Halberstam-knowing populace to be another \\"generic current event/recent poli-sci book\\" for the \\"new release\\" section of the book store.  This, it is not.  This is an interesting, nicely written piece from the first to last page.  <br />For the casual observer (me), or the policy wonk, this book provided ample amounts of refreshing and new information about he people, personalities, events, personal relationships, and domestic and foreign policy-making of the time period of the late 1980s and entire 1990s.  As the relevant precursor--Vietnam--many of the military debacles of the 1970s influenced military policy makers and their subsequent decisions (obviously) in the 1990s, greatly influencing their decisions (American foreign policy) in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda.  Why were we in Somalia?  Why did we want to restore Aristide to the bottom-of-the-barrel garbage can of Haiti?  You'll find out why from this book.  The Rwandan genocide was more efficient than the Nazi exterminations if one looked at it from a per capita number killed - divided by - the time it took (to eradicate \\"the other\\" point of view.)  <br />Many policy makers and players from the past and recent present are noted: Zbignew Brzezenski, Cyrus Vance, Eagleburger, Reich, Les Aspin, \\"Wools\\", Rubin, Howe, \\"old Henry,\\" Schultz, Tony Lake, Powell, Baker, Christopher, Stephanothingness, Holbrooke, Shalikashvili, Scowcroft and Milosivic among others.  Lloyd Bentsen's life was interesting enough to have me looking for his biography.  <br />The Gulf War is covered, and the most influential person that brought the new technology mentality to the U.S. armed forces:  Colonel John Warden.  Schwarzkopf, and arrogant buffoon, got the credit for doing what?  The Bosnian calamity and it's foreign and primarily domestic implications cover mammoth portions of this book.  The acute and redundant details of: who thought what, said what where, that was not listened to by whom, can motivate the reader to speed read through the middle portion of this 500-pager.

US	52947165	R20PH968DOE936	9748303349	18094077	Off the Rails in Phnom Penh: Into the Dark Heart of Guns, Girls, and Ganja	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Wild Wild East For Isolated Expats	Geographical headline bias to boot, this is a fascinating look into this world of Phom Penh through the eyes of a recurring visitor, who became intimate with westerners living there.  It's not just a gonzo journal.  The author researched past, recent, and current Khmer history and politics, as well as how things really work in the capital of Cambodia politically, socially, and culturally.  His insights are only of his experiences with expats in their own islolated community, who are living in their own exclusive world.  (Again), This is not a book about Phnom Penh nor Cambodia, but the lives and experiences and attitudes of some western expats living there.  Most of his insights are from these people who've chosen to live in Phnom Pehn.  Many stories pique further interest, while others bring thoughts of danger and loathing of the type of people who go and stay in this city for long periods of time.  In this context, it is very insightful and somewhat balanced.  The author did take time to write in a serious attempt to note his experiences there.  There have been claims of exagerration by some after the release of this piece.  This can't be proven either way.  Many expats in Phnom Pehn are unhappy to have been written about and claim to have been quoted without their permission, and the author I am told is not able to return because of some of the anger caused over this book.  Some of the more undesirable elements of the world will no doubt come to Cambodia after reading this book.  As of November 2002, there are some writers in Saigon, trying to write about similar things (attempting to duplicate Amit Gilboa) that go on in Saigon, although they are in no way in comparison to what life is like in Phnom Penh.  This is an interesting look at the world and the people who choose to live in Phnom Pehn.	2002-11-11

If you put 3 economists in a room, you'll get 6 different answers.  They can tell us why things are happening at the moment, and why things happened in the past--but they never have and never will predict the future accuratley.  Human nature, behavior, and psychology, influence the cold, hard numbers.  What will happen tomorrow?  Nobody, not anyone knows.  <br />There are a lot of talking heads out there today--perhaps too many.  But Prechter is worthy of  a listen.  The author predicts a \\"deflationary depression\\" similar to that of 1929, based on historical data and statistics.  Yet, this is not a \\"gloom and doom\\" book, just a series of observations.  The end of the world is not coming.  But there may be a \\"contraction of the economy\\" based on many similarities of the past, (although global interdependence, technology and industries are radically different today, perhaps skewing such numerical predictors--for sure they will.) His basic message is: at this time reduce your debts and go into or stay in cash.  Whether he's right, partially right, partially wrong, or completely wrong (the future will tell), someone can't get hurt by following this advice at this time.  I've read disaster-never-to-be-realized books by the likes of Ravi Batra, and always taken them with a grain of salt.  Chicken little says \\"the sky is falling,\\" and the only people who benefit are the authors who write the book.  Recent and historical examples: Y2k, the next depression, world war III, or the return of a guy named Jesus.  <br />But I wouldn't put Prechter in the same league.<BR>At this time he's still massively bearish, citing stats, historical patterns and the present conditions in the market.  According to Prechter, there are a few things required for a major bottom to indicate it is time to buy. Number one is a reasonable valuation for stock prices. He measures those three ways: dividend yields, PE ratio (share price per earnings) andprice-to-book ratio. <br />As for patterns he believes one needs a completed price pattern according to the Elliott model of price behavior, which was developed by R. N. Elliott through close observation of the market. He cataloged the forms the market takes as investors move from extreme optimism to extreme pessimism.  As of October '02, according to Bob, we are in the middle of that and not are not at the end, or bottom.<br />No. 1 is an extreme buildup in extent of credit-and debt, the 20 trillion dollar bubble, which exists throughout the economy. Currently the amount of dollar-denominated debt is three times the value of annual GDP (gross domestic product)-the highest it's ever been.  <br />He makes an interesting read for an often dry topic. Especially when folks are out of the game.  Check it out, before you decide on whether to get in or out.  The sky is not falling.	2002-10-04

More brain-washing for college students by those out-of-touch buffoons in Ivory Towers.  The author is trying to distort the truth by simply leaving out the actual messages contained in the latter Suras.  Why has censorship become so common among Islamic scholars?  What is there to hide?  The truth, for that's why censorship exists in the first place.  In addition to the selected omissions, which is quite common in other books on Islam, there are nice brush-overs, politically correct de-icings, and attempts to present this hateful doctrine as a message of peace.  If someone writes a book on Nazi history should they leave out all the bad things?  That's what this author did.  If you're looking for honest and truthful information, that is actually translated into English from Arabic, there are plenty of other choices on the market place.	2002-10-03

Informative book, but could have used more proofing and editing.  As for the &quot;K,&quot; one of the first to voice the cracks in it was Edward N. Wolf, and now others have hopped on the band-wagon.  The creation, history, and current conditions are discussed.  Many reasons are provided as to why Americans are bemused with this fund.  Although the &quot;traditional&quot; pension is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, the 401k is still only a supplement to retirement--even if that's the only thing most Americans will have.  It's a supplement, pure and simple.  For most it'll provide some enjoyment and/or cut down on fixed-income living expenses, or maybe reduce the shock of those prescription medicine bills that are rising year after year.  If people diversify the 401k supplement over domestic and international stock index funds, micro, small, medium, large cap, growth, value, and balanced funds etc., they may benefit from long-term tax-deferred compound interest.  Hey, I forgot to throw additional money markets, bonds and REITs, for additional diversification.  The average American doesn't have the net worth, resources,  time, and life-time--to recover from such massive losses after a certain age.  And, that age is quite young.  For many but not all of those that did want to re-allocate, they were bound by corporate rules and regulations that hindered them from doing so--if they were a worker, and many lost years worth of potential earnings and savings.  Management wasn't bound by these rules, they were free to do what they wanted, and many of them posted enormous profits from these preferential rules.<br />   The E.R.I.S.A. act in 1974 was a scheme to &quot;empower&quot; the &quot;average&quot; American to have financial control over their future.  About 20 years later, the financial industry benefitted tremendously from 1990s market boom.  The CFPs and brokers, brokerage houses, and investment bankers rode the wave, understandably, and successfully promoted a fantastic advertising and marketing campaign.  Guru newsletters, financial magazines, traveling seminars, contradictory radio and TV pundits, and book writers did great business as well. <br />Who benefits from the 401k?  The employer does.  If this wasn't the case it would never have been allowed to exist at all by Congressional legislation.	2002-10-01

This is an issue that affects us all.  These issues are relevant and real, and every single one of us feels the influences and consequences of them in our everyday lives.  <br />Objective, balanced, and brilliantly written, this book is very conveniently organized. In addition to the table of contents, throughout the book there are topics in bold face, introducing the subject to come.  One does not have to read this book from front-to-back if they don't want to, but can jump around.  This is not an \\"esoteric\\" piece of work at all, and the many facts and factual tidbits are very interesting.  A lot of research and time was obviously put into this book.   <br />It begins with the historical preface our nation.  What was the Boston Tea Party really about?  The move for independence?  The Bill of Rights?  14th Amendment?  One can learn of many factual occurrences that took place in the past and are happening in the present.  It progresses up to our current year, discussing the recent scandals of companies like Enron etc.<br />This is not a \\"gloom and doom\\" book at all but an objective overview, and Hartmann gives specific and realistic actions that can be taken to move us back on track.  Recent examples of legal actions taken by communities of average citizens from middle-America are noted and explained. <br />Being well-covered and balanced, Hartmann examines and clearly explains the causes, actions, and consequences covering a wide array of issues such as free-trade, globalization, the media, privacy, judicial decisions, human rights, corporate behavior, recent corporate scandals, domestic and international politics, and Congressional and state legislation, and regulations.  This book can be helpful, interesting and informative, for folks who have an interest in some, or all of these areas.  Yet, it's also written for the layman, or casual observer of these recent events we've been exposed to by the (sleeping) media in recent years.  There is plenty of flavor in this book.  This is one of the books that are equal to Korten's \\"When Corporations Rule the World,\\" and other well-read books about this realm of our contemporary lives.  Must read for everyone.	2002-09-29

Books	5	8	10	N	N	American Dream Is Still Alive	....Unless You're Working 9 to 5.<br />I do agree with this statement.  Robert Kiyosaki and Lechter gives us reminders of the benefits of credit and debt management, compound interest, and ways to make money work for us, instead of simply \\"working for money.\\"  This book can benefit those who are financially literate or educated, casually interested in making money, or for those who need information on money and finances in general.  The author is a person who's accomplished what he set out to do, and his views are worth looking into.  Like most successful people, he didn't \\"work in the traditional\\" paradigm to achieve his financial independence.  Forget about the steel mill, corporation or government.  Kiyosaki's independent thinking \\"outside the box\\"  culminated in his voluntary retirement at the age of 47.  If a person wants to do that they have to create, produce, and make something of their own.  <br />This book seems even more relevant today in 2002, after the recent scandals in certain corporations.  Depleted Stock-option values and 401Ks have knocked a lot of folks down the financial \\"Joneses-ladder.\\"<br />One definition I'll paraphrase of wealth Kiyosaki noted is from Buckminster Fuller:  Wealth is how long a person can live/support them self, after they quit, are fired, layed-off, or lose their job.  How long could you last if you stopped working tomorrow? <br />This book is an eye-opener but in the back of our minds we know it  it shouldn't be.  Many Americans may not like Kiyosaki's views, (which are based on his real-life experiences), because it's too late for most of them to turn back.  I personally see these people quite often, and they come from all income brackets and ages.  From blue-collar union members to corporate yuppies.  I listen to baby-boomers wince at the prospect they're going to be hacking away at \\"the company\\" for a long-time to come after they finally decided to review the assets, liabilities, consumer-price-index and \\"golden tarnishedyear\\" pension fund and 401K.    <br />To Kiyosaki, owning a house is a liability. <BR>He notes the same steps individuals and couples take to get caught in what he calls the \\"Rat Trap.\\"  Buy a house, go into massive debt, work for someone else to earn a paycheck, keep paying bills, then die.  Work--mortgage--debt--bills--death.  Sound like fun?  <br />He penned a great phrase: \\"the leaning tower of suburbia.\\" <BR>In debt, hoping not to get fired, layed-off, or down-sized.  The author asserts his opinion on mortgaged \\"home ownership\\" because it influences behavior so much: more reluctant to take calculated risks in life, less willing to switch jobs and industries, or stand up for a bad situation that exists in the workplace.  Once a person decides to take out a long-term loan on a house they're going to live in, almost all of the choices and opportunities they once had evaporate.  Similar to a funnel:  We can pour our realistic wants and goals into a \\"funnel of opportunity.\\"  These are things we actually have the ability to do in life.  A funnel's mouth is wide, as are the opportunities and choices we have.  When a house is \\"bought,\\" the funnel of opportunity shrinks almost entirely to the choices and opportunity remaining for the homeowner:  work, keep up with the Joneses, and try to stay on top of the bills.  When a person or couples' home is their major asset (misnomer) it's not diversification either.     <br />Kiyosaki notes our educational institutions.<BR>High schools and universities teach students to think \\"inside<BR>of the box.\\"  The world has changed tremendously in the last decade alone, and one's ability to prosper may not be entirely what they know, but their ability to adapt and learn quickly in this ever changing economy.  Did anyone predict the Dot.com boom 5 years before it happened?  No, but a lot of people got into it.  <br />The author believes that it's better to know \\"a little about a lot of things,\\" than to know \\"a lot about one particular thing.\\"  In his view, \\"specialization\\" can be limiting in today's economy, and we need to \\"diversify\\" knowledge base and skills ourselves.<br />He notes we work for 3 institutions when we don't work for<BR>ourselves:  <br />1. We work for our employer or the<BR>share-holders. We work to help them get wealthy, and secure their retirement. We help boost their share holder earnings when massive layoffs occur.  But we are afraid of being let go, fired, or layed off by these same people.  Doesn't sound like a person in this situation is in control of their life does it?  Unfortunately it's true for 95% of the population.  <br />2.  We work for the government.  We pay taxes throughout our<BR>life, and even in death.  Where does our money go?  None of us really know.<br />3.  We work for banking mortgage companies.  <BR>paying off the long-term mortgage debt.  <br />To most Americans though--they've invested too much<BR>money, time, and emotional input into their current lifestyle and are too far along to change it.  For some it will offer hope, to others denial, or futility.	2002-09-27

The primary locations of this book are Hanoi and the north and Saigon and south.  Sheehan also takes a look into other places he spent time at as a journalist in the 1960s and 70s, and how they've transformed or changed, and/or haven't, up to 1990.  He notes some relevant points from his previous book, including the prophetic Ap Bac battle that took place in the early 1960s.<br />He returns to many of the places of conflict and speaks with the people.  His time in Vietnam and the relationships he had there had an enormous influence on him.  His return seems to be a mix of catharthism and a quest for objective observation and curiosity.  It should be up to a nation's own people to decide how to do things, but in one regard he could have been more critical and questioning of the policies of the post-1975 Vietnamese government.  100,000 people were sent to \\"re-education\\" prisons.  Southern supporters and participants of the NVA (Viet-Cong) were forced out to be dominated by northerners:  The communists were very repressive.<br />The title does make one wonder.  \\"After the War Was Over,\\" was written 14 years after the fall of Saigon.  Another Vietnam \\"War\\" book?  Not really, and that is good.  It discusses the lives and conditions of those who participated in the drawn-out conflict from not just both, but the many sides that actually existed, and where these people are at today in their lives.<br />Some of the post-war communistic economic policies and later reforms were described, which are interesting.  After the fall of Saigon in 1975, De Luan and the communists in Vietnam tried to collectivise agriculture.  A proven disaster 50 years before in the Soviet Union, and then again in Maoist China.  Collectivization was an outright failure in Vietnam as well.  In addition to collectivization policies, the Northern Cadres forced the northern concept of central planning on the entrepreneurial South Vietnamese, which again, just simply doesn't work, being so contrary to human nature. It doesn't spur efficient production nor proper means of distribution of resources and goods.  Did the Vietnamese communists learn anything?  Yes, they did--after the fact.  Now they claim to be the \\"first ones\\" to have departed (in 1986) from the moribund Soviet model.  A patriotic communist Nguyen Van Linh, was reformist minded and his positions on policy within the government have labled him as the Vietnamese \\"Gorbachev.\\"  He had ideas that were considered by the post-75ers to be \\"right wing\\" or radical, but in the end he had their ear, showing some of the ways the South Vietnamese did things, which were objectively speaking, successful.<br />In this piece two cities are described, Hanoi and Saigon.  Street addresses are mentioned and you can learn where significant happenings took place in both cities if you are going there.  Many modern buildings, houses, and hotels are noted also.  If someone is coming to Hanoi or Saigon, this book can be useful to learn about where things happened.  I discovered that I work in the same building where the Pentagon press briefings called the \\"five o'clock follies\\" took place.<br />Some of Sheehan's coverage of Vietnamese history noted how the Vietnamese drove out the Mongols in the 13th Century, and have been invaded by the Chinese no less than 17 times prior to the 20th century.

The Lonely Planet Thailand guidebook (for the entire country and not just the islands and beaches) also has plenty of information on Thailand's islands and beaches.<br />With the inclusion of \\"luxury\\" accommodation and over-priced \\"tourist\\" restaurants and trinket shops, it appears this book is marketed towards a particular group: North Americans who only have two-weeks, and therefore need to \\"plan\\" ahead for their trip. This is a particular market and that is understandable, but it appears that LP is trying to get a piece of this market, and gear this guide-book towards these type of folks.<br />One thing to note: Ko Chang is not off the beaten track by any means. It's going to be the next place completely destroyed by the Tourist Authority of Thailand. They are working on it right now, evicting local Thais who've lived there for generations to build hotels.<br />There is no where in S.E. Asia that is \\"off the beaten\\" track, except perhaps, parts of Laos. The trail is crowded, and continues to get bigger. If you're a long-term visitor or a \\"two-week hoteller\\" then this book will due.	2002-09-07

Why did our most prominent leaders and others, insultingly question the author's patriotism for coming out with this book?  Answer: embarrassment and an attempt to deflect the publics' attention away from these failures.  As for the intelligence community, bureaucrats are constantly trying to take credit for successes and pass blame to others for failures.  Since every agency, and department within every agency, has failed to some degree in this matter, they are all running for cover.  Egos and careers come first.  What is the most common \\"Washington way\\" to do it?  Attack the messenger.<br />Not necessarily pointing the figure, but noting that human nature, organizational behavior, agency turf-disputes, overlapping roles, and a lack of communication within and between governmental agencies, were all factors that led to this surprise that shouldn't have been.  These factors still exist today.  The politically correct CIA director George Tenet, is still on the job.  He should have been canned on September 12.<br />This is a very well researched exploration into the many events that happened before, during, and after this tragic event.  It's about the facts.  It can only help.	2002-08-31

From the river's mouth to its end in the Mekong Delta: Tibet, China, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.  Ed Gargan could have played a medical trump card to avoid the draft during Vietnam war, but instead he stood up for his beliefs and refused to register, thus serving time in federal prison.  This was an influential experience, and he did refer to it at times, and American war situation in Indo-china, understandably.<br />Noting the past history and recent events of these places, and then talking with people to get their perception and viewpoints on where things are headed.  Very balanced peppering of relevant historical occurrences, recent political situations, and down-to-earth local conversations about life in these places.  Indigenous life and the cultural aspects of it in the areas he visited were noted.<br />The Chinese ethnic Hans are continuing their colonization of Tibet, imprisoning people, destroying temples, and other aspects of Tibetan culture.  The secretive government of Laos is still in the moribund foggy myst of Marxist-Leninism, those \\"foreign white guys.\\"  He briefly tapped into the bohemian traveler opium-den culture of Laos on his way through, though as an observer and not a participant.  He also interviewed one of the few survivors of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge torture and killing prison, finally ending his journey with a young Vietnamese woman's observant description of contemporary Vietnam and where its people and nation are headed in the future.<BR>Very descriptive and observant piece of work.<br />There are some interesting facts that are noted by Gargan.<BR>Francis Garnier, the French colonist who traveled the Mekong for two years in 1866.  He apparantly didn't learn much, and he got what he deserved in the end.  Another tid-bit, is that the character Colonel Kurtz in the movie \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" is based on an actual person.  Also there are more pickup trucks per capita in Thailand than on any other nation on Earth.  <br />This is a great book for people who like travel books, and for those who have an interest in, or who are going to South East Asia.<BR>Another great book I'd recommend that is also about boat travel: \\"Three years in a 12-foot boat,\\" by Steven Ladd.	2002-08-26

His abuses ignored, because of his \\"cause\\" and his followers.  No one wants to be painted with the R word.  This author had guts to expose the truth for what the almighty reverand is all about: getting rich off of taxpayers' money and corporations, by claiming to represent the people he knows nothing about--the poor and disadvantaged.

One thing I liked about it, is that he isn't a professional writer.  Yet, he conveyed his thoughts and experiences well.  He didn't make excuses for his actions or the consequences.  He played the game and got caught.  Credit to Fellows for sharing parts of his personal and family life with us as well as his life inside Maha Chai and Bang Kwang Prison.  He was before being caught a shrewd drug courier, getting out of some very close calls with airport security and immigration, by impromptu ideas and actions.  He kept his cool, was very creative, and he had guts.  These were risks with such high consequences that very few would even think about taking them.  <br />The physical and mental torture, and the humiliation he experienced and witnessed was beyond human.  They are provided in detail. <br />After his release from Bang Kwang and return home to Australia he described the difficulty of adjusting life on the outside, and the tole it would eventually take on his friend he served time with.	2002-08-24

This author, who writes about Islam,  converted from it (not to it), at the age of twelve.  The author also cannot speak Arabic.  This book leaves out the Suras 5, 9, and 14, the chapters that promote violence against Infidels, defined as any and all people who practice other religions, or no religion at all. This is another attempt to make a quick buck because of the increased interest in the violent, hate-filled religion known as Islam.

Some basic grammar rules are included and can help someone use past, present, future, ability, and the classifiers if they want to learn the basics of using them.  It can be carried in your pocket, and I think that is the best asset.  It's a small book you can take anywhere.  The phonetical pronunciation was incorrect in one area.  The beginning consonant &quot;G&quot;is pronounced more as a hard &quot;g&quot; sound, but it is listed in the book at a &quot;k.&quot;  This caused miscommunication for it changes the entire word and meaning.  The beauty salon context, i.e., &quot;getting a haircut&quot; is a section that is not in this book but could be very useful.  This book is very affordable and helpful...just keep in mind some of the phonetic transcriptions, which already difficult in Thai to English, could have been more accurate.	2002-08-08

Do most Americans realize this or even think about it?....I've met only a few who do.   Since World War II worker productivity per capita has more than doubled.  And, the hours worked has increased so steadily that work hours will be at the levels of what they were in the 1920s.  The average American takes 12 days off per year, which is the lowest in the industrialized world.  Yet Americans are in more personal debt than at any time at our history.  Most today, will work into their 70s as the thing called retirement is not possible for most.  <br />Question: is it worth it?  The Puritanical work-consume-work-consume-die mentality is being questioned by some Americans, now that their investments, pensions, and 401-Ks have lost the principal to allow them to live and do what they have always been wanting to do.  This book may seem contrary to the way most Americans have been raised and advised throughout their lives.  <br />Do Americans have time to reflect, think, relax, and pursue anything to their liking?  The answer depends on who you are, so ask yourself that question.  This is a relevant book for a very relevant topic.	2002-08-08

Learning and reading things like this is interesting although I don't read books like this a lot. But I do have two cents to give, like everyone else.<br />I read this book from reviews and the fact that Alan Greenspan reads this author and apparently has been influenced by him. Dr. Kindleberger focuses on the most driving stimulant behind the market: human psychology.  Price to earning ratios, earning reports, and numerous economic indicators are the rational guides, but once the major forces of the market--greed and fear--take root, they can cause momentous shifts in upwardly and downwardly directions quickly, or painstakingly slow and steadily.  Mob or Crowd mentalities and the irrational forces behind them, are a recurring psychological and historical cyclical pattern according to Kindleberger, and he provides ample data to back this up.  And, if one wants to do well in the market they can focus on picking when the gyrations will occur, choosing when to get in and when to get out.<br />I often talk with two sets of boomers: those who &quot;hopped on&quot; in the 1990s and &quot;got off&quot; at the right times, or nearly at the right times.  It is cyclical, cyclical, cyclical.  They are the ones who have benefitted.  I also speak a lot with boomers who didn't get out of the market in time, or even at all (as of July 2002).  The results are significant and life-long.  Lifestyles are permanently affected for the rest of ones life, both in positive and negative ways.  And as Dr. Kindleberger notes, there will be another Mania that will come, and the opportune thing to do, is pick when to get on, and when to get off.<br />Although what I am describing is very simplistic, the theme of the book is that natural patterns of behaviour are buying excessively (euphoria), and also rampant dumping (panic), which again, exceedingly sends the market in both directions.  Baby Boomers that jumped on the stock-buying bandwagon in the 1990s, and didn't get out in time may not like this book.  They may be reading it to try to figure out what's going on, and if one is to read this book they shouldn't assume the author will dumb it down with simple analogies, and dummy charts for laymen.  It's not a simplistic Rick Edelman or Motley Fool type of book for the Boomer-come-lately, so stop complaining about the author's presentation.y Boomers that jumped on the stock-buying bandwagon in the 1990s, and didn't get out in time may not like this book.

But, coming from a slanted perspective of her own, she is just as biased.  This author is a Spin Doctor, no different than the Libs. in the media.  Instead of choosing one or the other, Americans should read, research, and think for themselves.  Choosing one side over the other is shallow, myopic, and intellectually limited.

One person, and idea, and a difference.  Wendy Kopp detailed  the relentless cycle of securing grant money to meet payroll to keep the organization afloat.  Often the life of this organization was within days of sinking, but alas, the golden check was cleared.  She is a  very gifted networker, who managed a large organization without management experience until she handed over the operational reigns to those who knew what was going on.  This account is from the perspective of the person who created the organization and ran it, so this should be taken into account.  Their was heavy emphasis on recruiting graduates from Ivy League universities, which is good, because the students they would be teaching almost never have access to teachers with Ivy League educations and exposure.  Those not in the Ivy Leagues seemed to not have a shot, although they could have made a significant impact.  The reason why Teach For America exists in the first place in my opinion, is because the monopolistic public school system is an outright systematic, bureaucratic disaster today.  TFA is a needed action, but also puts a band-aid on a bullet wound that is bleeding like a sieve.  Recommended to young, new teachers, that are still idealistic and haven't become cynical, burned out, or moribund yet because of politics, administrators, and idiotic school policies.	2002-07-20

Often the person being written about can clarify something that isn't clear.  Often, the person being written about can put a positive spin on some event in an attempt to make themself look better.  This is a good book about the humble actor  that looked at his pre-success years, going back to his mid-west roots, marriage, and the ups-and-downs of his experience in the film industry, which was covered a lot.  How did Harry get that scar?....the answers lies within these pages.  One interesting note is the story of a young producer, writer and director who made a movie in the 70s.  At the screening, many movie moguls approached the young creator and told him bluntly that his film would be a flop, no one would see it, and his career may be in jeopardy after producing such a poor piece of work.

The universal cult of this old bag of wind is revealed and implemented by the simpletons.  This is a personal account that takes place within a historical happening.  It is of subjective perceptions, emotions, and experiences.  It is a biographical account that covers many, many different areas of political, sexual, familial, and professional life.  Her intimate friendships were described as well as the \\"gang\\" of folks she gravitated towards while she was shunned by her community.  How her grandparents were treated right in front of her was disgusting.  What is such a paradox about the Communist cultural brainwashing was that the \\"heroes\\" of the cultural revolution, became the vermin and enemy in the snap of a finger.  Almost always, the victims were innocent.  Niu-Niu grew and succeeded and wrote a book about it.  The cultural revolution seems to parallel the Salem Witch trials.

Levine was considered to be the D.E.A's number one undercover agent, having arrested over 3,000 individuals over twenty-five years.  <br />Seeking truth, and having passion for his career, and strongly believing in the mission statement of the Drug Enforcement Agency, He wrote in a very direct manner which I appreciate.  What he observed in the agency was contrary to his life's work, and he had the courage and drive to speak out about it.  In certain instances, the more a D.E.A. agent penetrated into serious drug operations, the more anxious and admonishing the bureaucratic \\"suits\\" who ran the agency in Washington D.C. became.<br />When he and the agency came to close to nailing major drug kingpins, some with high political status in some South American nations, the agency basically shut the operation down.  Some of the Cold War alliances the U.S. had with nation-states were similar to it's relations/alliances to drug-dealing countries and cartel kingpins.  The Cold War made strange bedfellows politically and this transgressed into the War on drugs.<br />The most appropriate thing to do is prosecute United States political figures, Military, D.E.A., and C.I.A. bureaucrats for trafficking and conspiring to traffic narcotics.  Of course we all know, that isn't going to happen.  Yet we must fill our prisons with nonviolent, small-time working stiffs, casual drug users, to serve out mandatory minimum sentences.	2002-02-08

A: It's The Truth	Why did so many immediately discredit Goldberg's work--without<BR>even reading it?  Because apparantley, it struck a chord. Of the truth that is. I've seen this for years.  Had to listen to it; Had to read it. I am not a conservative, just a citizen and voter who wants an objective presentation of what's going on in the world and in our nation.  Why are college students so left-leaning while being, for the most part, so poorly read on the issues?  Answer: the media, and our beloved tenured Marxist-Leninist professors, aided by the electronic &amp; print rags, whose reporters admit by independent survey, being overwhelmingly Democratic (big D) and left leaning.  <br />If the tilt was to the right I would be just as frustrated.  I, &quot;Joe Citizen,&quot; just want the facts.  From there, I'll make my own, informed, well-read, opinion in my head, at the bar, dinner table, and at the polls.  That is all I ask.  But don't try to tilt the information you spout, because it only causes the public to be more skeptical and choose alternative routes of information, which we've been doing for the last 7 years thanks to the web.  We read what we want more so now, by searching and finding it, instead of just sitting and receiving it.  The significant declines in many subscriptions to some of the major current event publications prove this.  Unfortunately, most Americans today don't ask, they just absorb.  They've lost the will, thought, or cognitive volition or ability to question what they &quot;receive&quot; from the media.	2002-02-08

This book can help us reflect on what we often miss in today's society.  We need to be aware of who we are in order to make life's most important decisions.  This book provides a guide, or vehicle for those who want to more accurately know who they are.  (This book is not for everyone but is for most folks.)  <br />The physical mirrors we look into can actually become walls that obstruct us.  Our true self is not what we see but our thoughts, motivations, and fears we have in our heads as we go through life in relationships, career, family, making decisions etc.  Our past experiences do make a major portion of who we are today, and how we perceive life and relate to the people in our lives.  This is not a psycho-babble, new-age, inner-self &quot;soup&quot; book in any way.  It is an aid to help us be more introspective in our lives.  <br />Today, most of us are so busy that we don't have the time, or the awareness to look at the many experiences and people that have shaped our lives and outlooks, both past and present.  It is simply too easy today to get distracted by our daily routines.  For the many of us that are living unauthentic lives, our time is inadvertently consumed by commutes, long hours at work, television, booze, Prozac, and the one week vacation at the resort a couple of months down the road. If we are more aware of ourselves, then we can focus on how it makes us who we are, and how we can deal with it, grow with it, and turn our knowledge of our true self into wisdom, and make better decisions in our life.  It is a very helpful book.	2002-02-02

I have not read other biographies on James Dean.  There are over 60 of them.  Before reading I also didn't know a lot about James Dean, although I've seen all of his 3 films.  I do know the other Dean biographies  have mostly similar information.  This bio flowed well.  It delves into many facets of his personal and professional life, that many people aren't aware of.  Dean's childhood and high school years, acting aspirations.<br />His relationship with Rogers Brackett was a networked connection that that helped Dean get the breaks he needed in this brutally competitive industry.  Dean took advantage of the casting couch in being Brackett's boy toy.<br />Dean is still revered and still brings images of myth, youth and nostalgia to our popular culture, primarily because he died young, at 24.  He made only 3 movies unfortunately, because of his early death.  \\"East of Eden,\\" \\"Rebel Without A Cause,\\" and \\"Giant\\".  That's why there is such a fuss over the kid who died nearly 50 years ago who was average.  James Dean paid his dues.  He was totally broke for periods of time in New York while trying to gain experience and get recognition in this tough industry.  He did make it.  I can't technically break down this bio or compare it to other books.  Should I be reviewing this....?	2002-01-30

One of the most pleasurable experiences I've ever had in Thailand is eating the food.  There is such a wide variety food you can eat in Thailand.  As you begin to fall in love with this cuisine, you will want to eat new and more varied dishes.  Ordering can be challenging as you evolve into more advanced Thai foods.  Yes, you can point and gesture, but if you want to more fully enjoy the culinary delights of real Thai food, you need to know what it's called, and say how you want it cooked or mixed to your spice preferences.  There is a lot of important etiquette tips, that will help you if you're invited to eat in a home of a family in a village, or with associates in the city.  The regional, colloquial, and relevant slang is included.  This means, the author has been there and done it, having lived in Thailand for for the most of 25 years, along with superb homework &amp; research.  The photographer, Jerry Alexander helps the reader identify visually with some of the foods that are described.  The dictionary at the end included many useful phrases in addition to the food vocabulary.  One error though, is that the letter &quot;G&quot; in Thai is listed as a &quot;K&quot;  which is only the case when it is a stop final, at the end of a word, or syllable cluster.  Read, learn, eat, and enjoy.	2002-01-29

This is not an unbiased account of the origins, history, and development of the Islamic religion.  Excuses are made because of the Middle East's past and present failures at democracy, economics, and containing the massive population growth, which will add more misery to the many mostly self-induced problems the Islamic Middle East already has.  There is peace in Islam, but also plenty of violence.  The author makes excuses and false comparisons with Christianity and West to make up for these dark elements of the Quran.  She takes the rationalization, or &quot;excuse view&quot; for almost every blemish in Islam's historical and theological development.  What the fundamentalists believe in are contradictions to many of the teachings of the Koran: don't commit suicide, don't kill women and children etc.  If you want to learn more about Islam then there are a number of other books that are better than this one. Terrible book.  It seems to be written for Americans that have short attnention spans.	2001-11-28

He was tortured and put in a secret show-trial under the false allegations that he was a &quot;spy.&quot;  Why?  Because the Soviet Union wanted free labor to manufacture things for the Soviet army. The gulags were an act of brutal slavery by the Soviet Union.  It should be acknowledged.  There were Americans also wasted their lives there.  The misery of many wasted lives in Siberia, for both the young and the old.<BR>He vividly describes his journey east: herded like cattle on trains, then marched through Winter blizzards en shackled in chains. Some died along the way.  His escape is one of luck and careful planning, and the comraderie of his companions he escaped with on their trek to India, makes this story interesting.  The hospitality of the many people who took them in and fed them and gave them shelter for a night is heartening.  His account of Mongolia makes one want to go their.  It is a sad tale of human misery yet also of determination and a struggle for freedom.  <BR>     <BR>The writing is not spectacular but this is a very good quick read.  I'd like to know more of what the author did specifically after reaching India.  He lost his family and friends and beloved homeland, never being able to return after the war.  Yes, there were times when I couldn't imagine a person survived such a long journey on foot without water.  I don't know how they could have survived such a long journey, going days and days without water.  And the crossing through Tibet, with what limited supplies they had is difficult to believe.  Perhaps they went through only part of the Gobi desert.  Perhaps some dates were forgotten because of a lack of a calendar.  Regardless, this is a great book that is worth the read.  After you read it you can make your on judgments.  One can learn about the gulags and how they were administered also.	2001-11-28

How did it become so big and encompassing in our lives?  This is an autobiography of Tom Watson Jr., former President of IBM and son of the company's founder Tomas Watson Sr.  Auto-biographies usually paint more of the bright side than the dark side.  But he gave a lot his personal perceptions, fears, thoughts, and family relationships in this book, and for that respect is deserved.  He never came off as condescending considering the wealth and power he attained.  He was a poor student, who later became his own man serving in WWII.  He did look death in the face on a few occasions.  He proved from his own actions to became a good-thinking businessman while ascending to the helm at IBM, which was no easy task.  He appears to understand human psychology well also.  He also knew whent to get out of the strainfull rat race and enjoy his interests outside of the company.<br />He came across as a humanist who valued his employees in a personal way uncommon in corporate America.  As the company grew so quickly and became so large, there were obvious &quot;big company&quot; problems and issues to address.  And he did his best to tackle them.   <br />The book provided a lot of interesting historical background of <BR>his father, the origins of IBM and it's growth.  a lot of information about what was going on in American business and technology in the 1950s and 60s is noted as well.

From media reports, the question often asked is Chechnya a &quot;rogue province of Russia or independent state?&quot;  You can form you own opinion by reading this book, among others that cover this conflict.<BR>There is a lot of general information about the Chechens and their culture in this book.  It paints a picture of who these people are.  Chechen history and their relationship with Russia has been mired in conflict for centuries.  From the author's point of view, the Chechens have been not treated very well by their mammoth neighbor to the north, and constant intrusions upon them has caused them to suffer because of this oppression.  The deportations of Chechens to Kazakstan by Stalin are among other things that fuel the conflict today, and the operation and ramifications of their exile were explained in a full chapter.  The cultural norms cited in the book are very interesting.  Traditions, dances, swords and feuds, and a fervent desire for autonomy.  Beheading takes place, with the head of the enemy shown around the town.  This book did appear to sympathize with the Chechens.  But that's for each individual to decide.    <br />A lot of information is given about the internal Chechen and Russian political, diplomatic, and military events and strategies that occurred during and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  The actions of Dudayev and Yeltsin are noted throughout the book.	2001-11-25

It is excellent.  The author wrote this before the attacks in September and his warning of a powder keg was insightful, and unfortunately correct.  The role of the U.S. government and the details of its political inconsistency is enumerated.  The myopic CIA, DEA, and American Oil companies, don't appear to look more than 5 minutes ahead.  Rashid is balanced and objective, and a local (Pakistani) not a Western foreigner, so he knows much more than any Western reporter could know.  <br />Many of the tenets of the Taliban's strict laws are noted: women can't go to school after the age of 8, singing and dancing are banned, English can't be spoken, ancient archaeological artifacts dating back thousands of years are destroyed, and the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, cannot be photographed because it is considered blasphemous, are among many of the practices this group enforces on its people.  Many things are financed by the drug trade, and the transport Mafia. The oil business adds to the complexities of Afghanistan and the Central Asian region.  This book explains many things for those who want to know more about why and how things are the way they are today.  These people are a piece of work.  As for the book: go for it.	2001-11-22

From English's relationship to Sanskrit and other languages, to the great vowel shift explaining why English often doesn't sound the way it's spelled--difficult and illogical for students learning the language.  The author went into depth about such topics as the culture of the Germanic tribes and how demographics influenced the development of the English language the way it did.  The Scandinavians, French, and many others have loaded the language with with many loans words.  It's a good informative read.	2001-11-22

If you want general information on the history, politics, individuals, and organizations involved in this dilemma this is an excellent book.  The recent Intifada, assassination of Rabin, and the recent West Bank settlement issue have occurred after the writing of this book. Yet to understand the current problem it's a great book that will never be outdated.  The roots of the cause remain the same.

I read this book because I am curious as to why so many of these disorders are more prevelant among our population today in America.  The writer delved into this.  In the 60s there were not nearly as many these cases (including eating disorders like bulimia and anorexia nervosa.)  Were these disorders not diagnosed?  Were those affected less willing to come forward?  I believe so.  But are these problems for many, another thing that is vogue today?  Is running to the Doctor for a Prozac prescription the answer, like Chicken-soup for the soul books, and Yoga at the health club.  Our we a nation of neurotics?  I am aware of how depression is a disease and chemical inbalances make it biological as other disorders, and is dreadful for those who deal with it.

He was motivated to write this book after attending Vann's funeral.  This book is not for, or against the Vietnam war, but a detailed description and over-view of it, and its developments in the early, middle, and latter stages.  It also told of Vann's personal background and professional moves, which were very relevant and interesting.  <br />This book detailed military strategy, current social and political events in N. and S. Vietnam during Sheehan's time spent there.  The Vietnam experience can be looked at from many aspects.  Many labeled it a &quot;political&quot; war but it was a &quot;bureaucratic&quot; one as well.  The Bureaucratic machine operated in very strange ways.  High-Ranking officers would make critical decisions, waste lives, and and carry out defeatist tactics and procedures for the sole purpose of getting a promotion called, &quot;getting starred.&quot;  Self-interests came first in Vietnam on the part of the Military.  Harkins, McNamera and Westmoreland, were buffoons who would not listen to factual reports that didn't agree or support their fallacial versions of reality.  They were incompetent.      <br />John Vann believed in what he stood for, and for his honestly he was labeled a &quot;maverick&quot; and &quot;trouble maker,&quot; which he was not.  He simply wanted to win the war, and keep innocent Vietnamese from being maimed and killed.  The My Lai massacre was not an aberration; it was the norm.  This historical account can give the reader the impression, that although our support for the South was noble, it was a mixture of he Ugly American and Catch-22.  This is a fascinating book.	2001-09-26

Barber has an extensive and well-put vocabulary.  One does not have to read this  from beginning to end, but by various chapter by chapter throughout the entire book. There are tons of empirical data, research, and historical footnotes in &quot;Jihad Vs. McWorld.&quot;  He provides and accurate and objective picture of what our world is transforming into today: the world is becoming smaller and more culturally homogenous.  Barber doesn't focus on negative or positive aspects but on the over-all ramifications.  What are the motivations?  The causes?  This book lists many.  Transnational corporate makeups, international job allocation, and consumerism in many areas of the world, can lead to diminished liberty and political and cultural autonomy, and lesser quality of life.  &quot;Robert Murdochization,&quot; the daily extinction of languages, and massive destruction of our environment are occurring.  Overpopulation is one of the major causes.     <br />One of hundreds of examples is the 1994 Chinese auto-mobilization policy of 1994.  what would be the effects of a nation of 1.3 billion people acquiring mass ownership of cars?  The global mineral and fossil fuel supply would be exhausted in about 5 years.  Can  developed nations tell LDNs not to acquire automobiles when they themselves produce, export, and use them daily?  Who is the biggest energy user, and waster in the world?  The United States.  Yet we must however, tell other nations' what they &quot;should and should not do,&quot; because of the negative effects on the environment.  Those in former Communist countries risked their freedom to read certain works to forsake them for MTV, Coca-Cola &amp; Baywatch.  It shows that the needs and wants have changed now that &quot;freedom&quot; is more available.  This book is not anti-consumerist nor anti-mass consumption.  Read it.	2001-08-23

He would note a cultural norm, then make the comparisons to how he in particular, and we as Americans in general, perceive things and behave. He also included his students' writing verbatim to give examples  of their perceptions.<br />This is not just a &quot;memoir&quot; but a look into modern China and a note of the changes that are currently taking place.  He experienced the xenophobic communistic norms that still are present in modern China.  His mail was intercepted, censored, and tampered with.  Certain students were planted to report any discussion regarding China to Communist Party officials.  There was an Orwellian atmosphere present at the University, and strict rules covering students' private lives. His trip to Yulin in the western part of China was very interesting.  During his time spent in Fuling it became &quot;home.&quot;  This is a very insightful book and is worth reading for anyone interested in China and/or the Peace Corps.	2001-08-18

Port, Kit, and Tunner, had an open schedule and slowly traversed in and near Sub-Saharan Africa.  Thoughts of life, dismay, the past and future, are all here.  The desert and sun were constant and relevant characters in this book.  One would likely appreciate these latter &quot;characters&quot;  more if they had been the the region prior to reading &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;--so go there first.  The prose and some of the wording is of the 1940s, when the book was published (1949).  Tennessee Williams' review that appears in the beginning of the book is good but read it after reading the book--he gave too much away.       The last part of the story takes on an intelligently gloomy quality and setting.  Glimpses of Kit's and the others' neurosis and insecurity become evident as they are one of the few eccentrics  lucky enough to live and go where they want to go, when they want to in general.  She and her companions can stay in a particular town for a day, week, month, or the entire Winter if they choose.  that is freedom.  Freedom of the mind and physical environment.  They develop relationships with the locals they come across, as well as some who are on the road, or Sand Dune as one might say.          The only nit-pick is Bowles' frequent, although brief passages, of French and Arabic expressions that were not transliterated.  It you like travel stories read this book.	2001-07-20

This is a brilliant book that said so much then in 1958, and says so much now today.  The implicit references are strikingly clear in the characters and situations presented by Lederer and Burdick.  When abroad our American psyche, consciousness, and sub-conscious attitudes and assumptions, have not changed since this book was written.  We are culturally, mentally, and linguistically isolated, and do not attempt to learn about other cultural norms for a variety of reasons.  Still today, the term &quot;Ugly American&quot; caricatures this ignorance &amp; arrogance by those who live behind the &quot;Golden Curtain&quot; (USA).        The authors also had the gift of saying a lot with few words.  Few can do this.  This is also a piece of work filled with humor.  Many times I chuckled aloud while reading this book.  I do believe that almost all aspects of Communism are evil and believed in the &quot;intelligent&quot; opposition to the Maoist and Leninist movements of the 20th Century and today.  Communism gains, and maintains strength and control, by the theft of an individual's heart, mind, and soul.  As for U.S. foreign policy in S.E Asia to counter the spread of Communism, it was was a debacle based upon arrogance and ignorance by politicians and military bureaucrats.  A deadly and futile combination.        The U.S. foreign policy effort in S.E. Asia was the blind leading the blind, culturally, militarily, and politically, and the result was our soldiers and innocent Asian citizens losing life and limb.  Lederer and Burdick realized this at the time of writing in 1958--before the tumultuous times of Vietnam.  It's a shame more influential bureaucrats didnt' read it.        This book is a must read for Americans who will be traveling or living abroad for more than a short period of time.  But also A classic however, for all Americans, whether at home or abroad.	2001-07-13

He gave a lot of honesty in himself and his personal perceptions.  I would recommend this book to those considering applying or serving in the Peace Corps.  One note, is that the training today is much different than it was in the 1960s.

I fit the statistics of the American consumer studied.  This is a realistic book most Americans can benefit from.  I have never considered myself to place a high value on material things, but I have used credit cards in the past to get &quot;this or that thing,&quot; later to implicitly acknowledge it wasn't a necessity.  And, I didn't really use the things I purchased very much.  This is a reader-friendly book.  The credit card industry is comprehensively studied.  Corporate debt is also examined, and the loopholes that exist to basically erase and forgive these debts is explained.  (Someone is getting a free ride.)  Our government is in massive debt as well as most of us are aware.  The U.S. in actuality operates on a credit card and that is covered. <br />In the last several years we Americans have witnessed, and been lucky to have participated, in one of the most robust economies in decades.  Steady economic growth and high consumer confidence, while incomes rose, with low interest rates, and unemployment at record low-levels.  Fact: We Americans on average are in more debt today than ever before in our entire history.  And the recent ballooning of our debt has occurred very recently.  Why?  Are we living too high, beyond our means?  Yes.  How do we give ourselves and others the impression that we are doing O.K. financially?  A: credit card and/or personal loan.  We can show off our toys, and don't need to explain that we don't really own them.  Most American folks today assume that we don't own most of the things that we have.  <br />If the economy slows down enough a lot of people will be in for a shock, unable to cover enormous amounts of debt they have accrued.  Bankruptcy laws have recently been changed by Congress to legally force those filing for bankruptcy to pay most of the debt back.<br />I'll be sitting back and laughing at these people, living my spartan lifestyle, completely happy and fulfilled.	2001-04-14

Retirement is a very recent phonomenom that began in the post-depression era.  How many Baby Boomers will live the lifestyle they want to have when they retire?  In the book you'll find the surprising results from several research studies and surveys.  Many Boomers will be in for a shock.  This book also provides a perspective that will contradict what most Americans have been consistently told their entire lives by their family, co-workers, friends, financial advisors, and mainstream American culture.  Whether working, middle, or upper-middle class, the traditional concept of the Golden Years will be an illusion for most.  Not all, but most.  For those that do achieve their financial status during retirement, there is one thing working against them: time.    <br />This is a very informative book that most Americans can gain from reading.   This book is not for everyone but it can offer insight and be a financial guideline for many.  So often, I see and hear people talk about all the things they plan on doing in life--when they retire.  Many Americans put their goals and desires on the back-burner until the so-called Golden Years.  I know people who did this.  And, many of them died before ever actually experiencing their plans they've long wanted due to heart attacks, Cancer, and car accidents.  Others were too old physically to go on that trek through Nepal or go sailing abroad.  Their investments provide income but not enough to do &quot;what they really want.&quot;  After a period of time, unless one has fulffiling hobbies, one doesn't know whether it's Tuesday, Friday, or Sunday.  <br />One thing I learned from this book is that one can do what they want to do in their younger, middle, and yes, latter years.  Why not break up these experiences and achieve them over the course of one's lifetime, instead of when one is &quot;old.&quot;  Perhaps we should focus on the journey itself and not just the end of it.  <br />Why do I see Americans, who come from the wealthiest nation on Earth, taking the obligatory and shallow 2 week, sound-bite vacation, when I am abroad?  One of the most common questions I am asked from people abroad is why Americans take such short holidays.  Two week vacation culture, enormous amounts of debt, and not knowing any different, seems to be the answer.     <br />I highly recommend this book.  as I've said, It can be very useful for many.  For the credit-card, two week vacation, &quot;wait-until-I-retire&quot; people, most will will reject and resent these authors' ideas.  Because for them it is too late to change the course they've taken.  Just simply read the reviews of this book on Amazon.com to find out who they are.	2001-03-29

Schlosser was very objective and did not bash.  He presented the facts and provided the historical development of our fast food nation and now, our fast-food world.  The author provided a complete approach to the many issues that exist in the fast-food explosion which has taken place over the last few decades and the severe ramifications we now face.  This book examines the history, growth, business practices, marketing, food-science, flavoring chemicals, R &amp; D Research, and the politics and influence of American fast-food.  Ample amounts of statistics and data are available.  What are the politics behind the interests of these mammoth companies?  Where is fast-food political money sent?  This book tells us. <br />Not only has this homogenization run rampant throughout the United States, but now it is happening world-wide right in front of us.  When protesters in foreign nations attack and vandalize U.S. installations do they target our embassy, or military installations?  Now attacks and vandalism of McDonald's and other fast-food restaurants like KFC, are the most assaulted statistically, from S.E. Asia to Europe.  The world-wide explosion of certain fast-food restaurants is methodical and carefully planned.  The number of McDonald's that open per day  across the world is a frightening statistical fact.  <br />Obesity in the United states has exploded to epidemic proportions according to the medical community.  What do we believe is the reason behind this epidemic?  And now, obesity is rising tremendously in nations once the most healthy such as Japan and China.  Heart Disease, the number 1 killer in America is now rising in These nations as well as others.  What could be the reason for this?	2001-03-20

This is a Classic Travel Book.  I've read quite a few over time.  Brad Newsham is first and foremost a seasoned experienced traveler, who spread out his trips over periods of years in his lifetime.

Newsham however, in addition to being a great traveler, is a great writer, who has keen insight into the people, physical environment, and intangible benefits that travel brings to the individual.  <br />Vivid descriptions, recollections of his conversations, and providing backgrounds of the local and traveling folks he came across make you want to grab your small bag, and hop on the next plane out.<br />His goal of finding a person to bring to the U.S. that otherwise would never be able to, makes many of us want to do the same thing.  In the end we find out who the person is Brad will invite to our country.<br />I first heard about the this book while Newsham was on a radio talk show, while I was driving from Key West, FL to Seattle.

What follows is my response to those who criticized the author because she described her relationship with Jek in the book.  That friendship was useful in gaining information and allowed the author to further immerse herself in the sub-culture she was researching.

This Lonely Planet edition for Thailand had accurate information on accomadation, pricing, culture, food, language, religion, and historical background.  Great &quot;atmosphere&quot; descriptions.  The maps of the cities and towns were very helpful.  I think the author Joe Cummings, did an excellent job as well as those who assisted.

Kerouac lived and did what he wanted in this story (and mostly in his life.) His description of Berkeley and the folks he encountered was interesting, and is full of youth, freedom, and the desire to experience.  This is a different read than &quot;On The Road,&quot; in the way it flows.  His train hops up the west coast, jaunt to North Carolina, and the hike with Japhy, can make one ruminate.  &quot;Raymond Smith&quot; was searching for some meaning to life in this book.  This piece was written by Kerouac when he still had energy and life left in him. I'd like to know a lot more about Gary Snyder, who is the character Japhy Ryder in the book.

Steinbeck is a genius who can say so much, so brilliantly, with so few words.  He noted subtle regional differences of the people of our country but what I liked was on of his many points I agreed with,  to paraphrase...we are more American than we are Northerners, Southerners, Westerners, Whites or Blacks as a whole.  Another thing I can relate to is how in the beginning of the book, as Steinbeck was preparing for his journey, American folks were asking typically curious and also very stupid questions about his trip, and why he wanted to partake in it.  Is there something wrong with Americans who have a desire to explore and experience new people and places?  Americans are still as chained to this rigid mentality today as they were when Steinbeck penned this classic.  A must read.	2000-11-02

We Americans are lucky to have been born here, and are lucky to be United States citizens.  Yet this intriguing book taps into my disdain for what America has been devolving into culturally.  <br />Berman notes the current intellectual collapse of the United States which most of us have become aware.  Comparisons to the fall of the Roman Empire are noted.  There is some truth to Berman's observations in my opinion.  It is sad, and it is the choice of our modern, myopic, conspicouosly consuming, now-nowist materialistic, nation.  In my opinion, traditional literary works have fallen by the way-side on college campuses so students can read a minority and/or politically correct author who can't write his or her way out of a paper bag, JUST because they are a minority or politically correct author.<br />We ingest chemicals and foreign substances like Prozac,  Zoloft, and St. John's wort, so we can &quot;feel good&quot; and &quot;function properly.&quot;  Miracle diet pills, Gingko Biloba, Echinacea, self-help new age psychological books, and a Yoga class at night, give us some synthetic spirituality, while we're not driving through rush hour to our high-turnover, &quot;reorganized&quot; jobs.  We see our families a few minutes each day, while little Johnny thinks that the Mississippi river flows in the Pacific Ocean.  <br />As for global homogenization, here's what I gained from Berman's McWorld concepts that we're experiencing so much of today. The concept was brought to my attention by Benjamin Barber in the early 1990s. <br />This is an interesting and somewhat disturbing look at the United States, which always has been and is even more-so now, the intentional and unintentional active leader in transforming Earth into our generic McWorld.  Encroaching global homogenization has reached Europe, Asia and South America, and it appears that these societies are culturally and intellectually slipping like the United States has been for several decades. Our free-fall into the New World Cultural-Economic order, to repeat, is being led by the culturally crassest of the crass.  Sadly, most Americans are too ignorant and just plain too stupid to be aware of what is occurring.  If they were cognizant of our transforming culture, they wouldn't likely  care anyway. I've seen too many cases of it time after time in the U.S. and abroad.    <br />As Berman stated, today The United States' primary exports are dense television sit-coms, MTV, Pop music, CNN, insulting corporate brands, mind-numbing advertising, and a plethora of corporate fast-food chains that we see the world over.  Not the ideals of a constitutionally-based representative democracy.<br />There has been a devolution of American principles in many areas.<br />I do agree with almost all of Berman's observations.  I am not entirely pessimistic about them, however because there isn't much I can personally do about it, except try to think for myself and keep my own personal sense of eclecticism.  There are many factors outside of the U.S. as well that are causing us to think less for ourselves.  Economic interdependence via trade, communication advancement, the Internet, free trade agreements, NAFTA, GATT, IMF, WTO, the popularity of American television shows and films by foreign cultures is also a major reason why McWorld is spreading.  In other words, people from other cultures like it and want it.  And it's not the fault of the United States. These other cultures are watching, buying, and absorbing it by their own choosing.  At the same time, it pains me to see a Pizza Hut in Thailand, Wendy's in Europe and a Burger King in Guatemala.  I might as well stay home. This is an important book that as many should read as possible.	2000-10-31

I've read numerous critiques, analysis, and interpretations from scholars on &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot;  Understanding Friedrich, his life, and his constant pains, give some insight into what may have underlined his beliefs.  I think to best understand &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; a person should read it at least twice.      I believe a reader can take many of the themes and metaphors and apply them to his or her belief system, or personal philosophy.  We all perceive things in different ways, and we can take what we want out of this work.  Individuality, and the constant question and resistance to organized institutions is what I like to take from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; as Zarathustra walks along the mountains, trails, hills, and towns, in his quest to think for himself and tell others of his thoughts.       The style is direct and the many exclamation points give Nietzsche's points a &quot;shout!&quot;   Nietzsche notes the importance of individuality and the dangers of becoming one of the lemming-like sheep that follow the herd, whether it be nationalism, religious zealotry, or the unquestioning acceptance of basic societal norms.  Nietzsche rakes Christianity and organized religion over the coals, with knockout punch after knockout punch.   Another theme I take from &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; is that one person's vice is another's virtue, and we should focus on ourselves and what we believe in, and not spend time attempting to have others accept our ways, and certainly now want them to accept us.  We should simply do our &quot;own-thing.&quot;  One person's goals and values can be, and often are, abhorrent to another person. <br />There is certainly much more to his works, and any person can go deeper than myself, because I read non-fiction primarily.  If a person reads thiswhen they are in their late teens or early twenties, perhaps it can help them reinforce who they are.  Anyone can benefit from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; if they allow themselves the opportunity.	2000-10-02

This was in some ways similar of course, but genuinely different than his first over-land trip with &quot;Ghost Dancing.&quot;  &quot;Nikawa&quot; is a new form of transport, and the route is fixed, and there is a schedule that is adhered to, understandably.  And again, LHM takes himself and his readers to a part of America most of us miss, just as in his first book.  &quot;Pilotis,&quot; the assistant in this journey reminded me of the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; concept used by Pirsig, but Pirsig was Phaedrus, and Pilotis was a friend of LHM's, an actual companion.     <br />To me it is free-flow reading, and descriptive of the natural surroundings he encountered near and afar, on this 5,000 mile journey into the Real America.  How many reading of this journey wanted to leave their cubicles and mundane suburban life behind while reading &quot;River Horse?&quot;  I did.  And I have!  <br />This book can be a bit &quot;prosy&quot; and he offers thoughts and views on &quot;this and that.&quot;  It is quite an interesting journey.  Give it a read. LHM is free, and can make you dream.	2000-09-29

Not an idealist or rebel, just a qualified individual who's writing about what he's experienced and studied.  The history and development of our corporate-run world is explained, and the results examined.  This is a subject that affects us all.  People must be careful to note that this is not an anti-capitalist piece of work, but an axamination into what corporate-globalism is doing today and will continue to do in the future.  (Were the WTO protesters in Seattle, IMF protestors in DC, London, and Prague malcontents?  Yes, some of them were, but the right, center and left were united.) As for a lack of humanism in globalism it is paramount.  And to the left, the Communist nations were exploitive and destructive as well.  The Soviet Government was a corporation itself. <br />This book makes us want to go back to a decentralised, locally controlled way of life, and that is something that will not return.  I highly recommend this book.  It is excellent, and provides a basis for further reading.	2000-09-28
US	52947165	R3HT54OB7FHIWQ	051788058X	928983827	Confessions of an Eco-Warrior	Books	5	22	31	N	N	This Book Can Change Attitudes	Dave Foreman, lifelong preservationist, and founder of the Environmental organization called \\"EarthFirst!\\" provides an insightful explanation into the state of our nation and our world today from the preservationist viewpoint.  Foreman refers often to historical information, biological research, ecological studies, demographic trends, science, population growth, political and economic facts, statistics, and motivations to explain the \\"why,\\" \\"who\\" and \\"how\\" of our environmental condition today. \\"Common man\\" cattle-ranchers, behemoth corporations, bureaucratic agencies, and working and middle class--us, I, we humans--are relevant in this very mature and logical book.  This is not a political or economically ideological book.  The goal is to preserve what's left of our planet, pure and simple.  \\"EarthFirst!\\" is inclusive for people from all economic, sociological, political, and religious backgrounds.  In other words, it's not just for the so-called Greeners or Naturalists.            The bibliography noted in this text can lead anyone to further learn about the multitude of thinking, politics, history, and scientifically-based fact, which is the foundation of the preservationist movement.  Foreman's description of the many species of plant and animal life makes the reader want to jump right into the natural world.  Most of it is gone, however.  Extinct.  And many more species of animal and plant life are dwindling everyday.        In the past I've read and viewed descriptions of \\"EarthFirst!\\" from those not familiar with environmentalism or biocentrism.  Its coverage of \\"EarthFirst!\\" was extremely misleading in my opinion.  This book is not a ranting and raving diatribe in any way.  It is completely the opposite.  This is an honest look at what we humans have been doing for centuries, and the all-encompassing ramifications and lower quality of life that will result from it for all of us.  This book unemotionally describes and explains how our nation and world has beentransformed, and it is saddening and frustrating.  But that does not mean that it is too late for the expansion of positive preservationist thinking, eco-education, and action.  In fact, it is more important today than ever at this stage.      I've never been involved in environmental movements or have been much of an Outdoor person.  I go camping occasionally, have done some hiking, and have always respected and admired natural beauty.  Yet, I was mostly oblivious to much of the details of the environmental issues that I read about in the newspapers, saw on television news, and watched on documentaries regarding the environmental topics of today.     It is people like me that a book like this can reach, and change.  I am one of the masses.  And this book can, I believe have a profound impact on the masses, in the way we think and how we act.  Every North American should read this book.  In my opinion it should be required reading in our schools as a starting point on how we view our world.	2000-09-21

This book covers a recent, notorious crime spree, that took place in the Seattle area within the last five years: mid to late 1990's.  &quot;Hollywood,&quot; and his dedicated friends' lives were just as intriguing as the main focus of the book.  From start to finish, a great book, that describes some interesting facets of the green Pacific Northwest.   Scott, the brains and guts behind these capers, could have become successful in many different area of life.  He did appear to have a selfish side.  He certainly led an interesting life, and he was successful at the things he set out to do. He liked to live the high life, and that required a lot of money.  Luck cannot last forever.

Motives and triggers were investigated by interviews with family and  friends to explore what may have drove this person to commit these truly  sick crimes.  Cunanan's life was further looked into, covering his above  average intelligence, Constant chameleon-like appearance changes and desire  for the &quot;high life.&quot;   He was a habitual liar who told many  different people many different things.  It is very likely that a major  precipitating factor to this killing spree was that Cunanan thought he was  HIV Positive.  However, this is now disputed as false that he ever though  he was hiv positive.  Angered at his presumed fate he turned against the  world and people.  An autopsy on him after he took his own life revealed he  was negative.  One can read this book quickly.   <br />The author would  describe what Cunanan would do, and what he would think, while he was all  by himself.  Does this author have ESP, or has he been channeling with  Cunanan.  Perhaps he hired a psychic.  This is a book that had to be thrown  out as quickly as possible after the media hype to cash in on it.  So take  if for what it is:  synopses of a killing Spree that needed more depth.	2000-09-07

And, from both sides from the inside,  guards and inmates.  Prison history, culture, slang, violence, lore, norms,  protocols, and social expectations are explained.  The author Pete Early,  is the only author known to have been allowed to access all inmates at the  prison, without guard escort or protection.  He visited Leavenworth several  times over a period of years.  He was free to ask questions, discuss, and  listen to whatever those confined at The Hot House told him.  Inmates'  crimes, thoughts about life in prison, thoughts about dying in prison, and  their basic attitudes and beliefs, take the reader to think about what it  would be like spend time in prison.  <br />Early also takes takes us into the  Department of Corrections culture, describing the guards, correctional  system SOPs, career development, and the politics of working and running a  major prison.  <br />Leavenworth, or the The Hot House is named so, because of  the heat and humidity during those hot Mid-western Summers, especially in  the upper-elevated portions of the prison.  Anyone who has had a faint  interest in Prison and correctional life, from television documentaries to  movies, will enjoy and learn a lot from this book.  Highly recommended.	2000-08-28
US	52947165	R1FFJC4H673E28	0385479565	905671096	The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Kinda Sad	I'd recommend this book to anyone.  The author did like to spend time  describing what some of the main characters cooked for breaksfast on a  given day, and what they were thinking, which was totally irrelevant to the  story.  Aside from that, this piece of work is a quick-read true story of  how a group of civilian and military individuals safely removed the deadly  Ebola virus from Suburban Washington, D.C.  The author presented the  possible origins, background and horrifying affects of this virus.  Ebola  is so malicious, that one would be better off taking their own life before  succumbing to this filovirus which turns organs into liquid.  Blood from  internal hemorrhaging emanates from every orifice of the body.  The virus  attacks the brain, and liquefies it into jelly like other parts of the body  causing dementia and psychotic episodes.   The fatality rate is usually  90%.  Ebola has the ability wipe out huge amounts of human population, and  in nations which don't have high-tech medical facilities and resources,  Ebola's outbreak is something we may likely hear of again in the Zaire  region or other parts of the world.  the fact of whether or not it can be  transmitted through the air was a serious question at the end of the book.   There are different strains of Ebola and it has a keen ability to mutate  and adapt to hosts of different species.      The author's note of how  nature was possibly responding, or avenging the massive human population  explosion was intriguing and made me think.  Is it nature's means of  defense against the constant and unending onslaught of Human population and  so-called growth?  As of now, Ebola has retreated to the Jungle, where the  strain of this filovirus is residing, waiting to amplify. And it likely  will again.      One serious although morbid note.  Nations in Africa and  other parts of the world have high birth rates, combined with higher life  expectancies due to Western medical technology.  Disease, hunger andpoverty punish the people in many parts throughout their lives.  Yet, they  can't contain their population growth. Ebola, like Aids in Africa, may be  looked at, as nature's way to a degree of leveling off the population  explosion.	2000-08-24

Everest Disaster	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Chilling Account of Another World	This was a well-written account that was very informative for someone like  myself, who knows little about Mountain and Ice climbing.  Descriptive of  the environmental conditions and elements, safety protocols, and climbing  history, Krakauer tapped into the drive and determination of the Alpinist  in general, and in particular those that he ascended Everest with that day,  that ended in tragedy for many.  I liked learning more about the Sherpas,  who are vital to any expedition if it was going to reach the top.  Writing  this book was Krakauer claims, a cathartic experience.  Possible causes  that led to the deaths were explored.  The hurricane force winds in  subfreezing temperatures, the thin air, which makes one mentally  delusional, and the raw physical strength required has claimed the lives of  many climbers over the last 70 years.  Climbers often aid a struggling  companion suffering from a lack of oxygen, frostbite, hypoxia, and physical  exhaustion.  There are several different serious ailments that can result  from the high altitude.  Even the most accomplished, safe, and physically  fit climbers remain on the mountain today as their resting place.  When the  climbing expedition had to ascend over the Khumbu Ice falls, crossing  extremely deep crevasses on flexible aluminum ladders, it made me cringe.  The author described how one climber, when squatting to relieve himself  outside his tent in the morning, slipped down  an embankment of ice, and  later, died.  Minor mishaps can and do lead to death.  Other climbers have  fallen 7,000 feet, off of the &quot;Kangshung face.&quot;  Krakauer also  noted the recent commercialization of Everest as well.  (Pittman made me  sick.)  There are tons of garbage at the base camp of Everest remaining  from several expeditions over time.  Recently, wealthy dilettantes have  been lured to climb Everest, and the culture is different than that of the  traditional alpinist community.  Why did Hall and Fischer remain high on  Everest well past their pre-determined descent time, considered a very  serious safety protocol?  One possibility, is that the two ran separate  competing expedition companies at Everest, and wanted as many members of  their individual teams to reach the top as possible.  There were business  pressure as well as the media coverage in several countries during and  after this climb.  Media exposure, marketing, and future clientele may have  been in the minds of these two men.  Also possible competition in general.   This is only a possibility.  Had the storm arrived 2 hours later, everyone  would have most likely lived.  Had it arrived 3 hours earlier, many more  lives could have been lost.  I respect people who'd attempt such a feat.   Kraukauer and Fischer were from Seattle as well which makes me feel good.   I loved &quot;Into the Wild,&quot; and &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; was very  intense for me.  Gotta read it	2000-08-19

Where he came from, how we grew up, personal life  &amp; influences, and how his political philosophy was formulated and  developed over the course of his career.      He changed the strategy of  the Republican House minority and charted it's course to become the  majority party long before it occurred after the elections of 1994.  For  that he deserves credit for long-term planning and strategy, and his  constant drive to achieve his political and societal goals for  America--whether love him or hate him--he must be given the serious credit  for start, development, and eventual shift. Gingrich was the ultimate  Machiavelian politician.  The ends justified the means.  He threw bombs,  toppled Jim Wright and uncovered some of the pompous transgressions of  House members.  Newt didn't live in a glass however.  GOPAC was another  siginificant achievement of his.    I highly recommend this book.      I am  aware that there are several Gingrich books available now that are more  updated.	2000-08-07

Upon arriving to the Sunshine state, it is best to add  onto this base of (LP) information by word-of-mouth from fellow travelers  and locals.  This addition provided me with enough information, and it  certainly beats the AAA guidebooks, (and many other travel books), which  are short, shallow, & designed for the exciting people that travel in  RVs and those that mingle with the \\"Days Inn\\" crowd.  Important  to note: there was sarcasm and juvenile expressions in thie book, that  appreared to be condescending.  This is not the first time that writers for  LP have done this.  Often, the chirpy sarcasm, was indeed, incorrect.  LP  should make a note of it.  Many-a-times, international backpakers/travelers  think they \\"know\\" most everything, becuase the think they've  \\"been there and done that.\\"  Usually it's quite the opposite.

I learned more about the Mormon Church, and the more I learned the frightened I've become.  This  is a great book.	2000-07-19

This is a fascinating story.  One that makes you feel you are right there with Stephen Ladd on his journey to experience a part of the world in his personally constructed boat  &quot;Squeek.&quot;  Not only did I take this trip with him while reading  this book, I also became envious, knowing that I lack the creativity,  stamina, and courage to ever do what he accomplished.       A traveler who  is individualistic, well-read, and an exceptional writer, his journey is a  must read for all.      I think many Americans caught up in their current  lifestyles today could gain insight from this book.      I hope that  Stephen Ladd sets out on a journey like this again someday.  How about it  Steve?	2000-04-17

After reading this story I cut up my credit cards.  Chris lived a &quot;free&quot; life.  I wanted to jump in his shoes while reading the book, and realized that I  couldn't live and travel like he did.  I just can't tough it that much.  I  do think that Chris was looking to hard to get to something, that may have  never existed.  There were likely underlying causes to his strive to get so  close to nature.  He didn't prepare himself well at all for his trip to  Alaska.  He was an individual, and in today's society, individuals are hard  to find.  Kudos to McCandless.	2000-02-23

Many studies revealed things we'd expect.  However most gave us a new train of thought  to work with.     In America there are a lot of &quot;poseurs&quot; who  drive the luxury cars, wear the expensive clothing, and live in prestigious  neighborhoods. In actuality these wealth-projectors are quite broke.  They  finance most of their material possesions to the hilt, and if they lost  their job, or there was a sudden downturn in the economy, they would likely  lose all the things they're &quot;renting.&quot;  I have seen this happen  to some people.    I learned a lot from this book.  It gives a great sense  of perspective, that we at times can forget in today's society, as well as  prudent financial advice from those who've reached the million mark.	1999-12-27

We as people posses these....he recognizes he possibly has more of these issues than those that are not in  porn and gives them as potential reasons for being in the business. But he  also notes he likes to get tail and is a sexually driven person. That's  fine.        There are some funny tales about some of the actresses, as  well as insights on how the business side of pornography works.  This was  worth the read. Jerry speaks from the heart and doesn't side-step with his  opinions about the folks he's encountered.	1999-11-02

We learn again how intelligent he is, and how ambitious he was from such an early age. Whether you like Slick Willy or  not, after reading this book, don't ever count him out. He has nine lives.

A dentist with a career ahead of him. The Lure of money led to him dabble in the &quot;Candy&quot; of the 1980's. Intriguing was how he hid so close to the authorities as a fugitive. Good  reading.

Contacts are critical, and no, it doesn't mean &quot;using&quot; people or constructing superficial  relationships simply for personal gain.    When I moved from the West Coast  to the East Coast, clueless to what and who was what, I ended up getting a  lead in a bar that turned into a job. This initial contact helped me meet  atleast 16 people, get into an invitiation only black tie dinner (the  Republican House-Senate Dinner in Washington D.C),  and learn new skills  that lead to a very positive career change.	1999-03-15

The author takes us to Axl Rose, whose megalomania and power-trips wreaked havoc to  almost all of the people he dealt with professionally and personally. He  fired roadies on a whim, and severely beat up fans, while his thug cronies  restrained them, in several instances. Rose would start a show up to 3  hours late for the fans who paid their hard earned money to hear the music  from the band they loved.      I have seen GnR a couple of times, all over  the world. I have always loved their music. It is the music that matters,  but the stories on how the frontman perceived the world made me believe  that some of GnR were just scumbags who got lucky.    There is recent knews  of Duff, Stradlin, Sorum and Saul gigging together, while Axl still owns  the rights to the GnR name. Hopefully Guns will get together with some  material from most of the original songwriters...If they can stand to put  up with Roses' Histrionics and personality disorders. This was a good read,  and well worth it, not just for the GnR fan but the modern rock fan in  general....Come and get me Axl!!	1999-03-14

Rules are noted and some of its budding offenders are followed to the facilities where they jump through the hoops. This book was well written and an informative quick read. Bing inspired me  to read more books about the topic, which I have, and am still doing now.  The only solution we have, besides social bandades, is to remove the  viscious from society. After a period of time, rehabilitation and the  ability to get up in the morning to get a job, becomes highly unlikely. A  very good book.	1999-03-11

And I have always liked his lyrics and music when he performed  with Jane's and Porno for Pyros. I like to hear the story behind the person  at personal and proffesional levels. Not just the &quot;how&quot; but the  &quot;why.&quot; Thompson covered enough ground for me and there were  interesting tid-bits about Perry and his bandmates. Thompson uses a little  bit of &quot;hypster hyperbole&quot; but in a way he has to write in this  fashion to appeal to the people that may be interested in Farrel enough to  buy this book. I liked the musical, economic and personal side he wrote of.  Now I see him as less enigmatic but certainly just as interesting. This is  a good quick read. I hope Thompson does some coverage of some of those rock  n' roll personas that present mysterious images like that of farrel. There  are plenty.	1998-12-01

Film has its limits of course and one must choose which elements to present to an audience. At Jim Morrison's grave today, why do  more visit his tombstone more than Victor Hugo? Because he's had a  tremendous impact on certain aspects of rock/cult culture. He had  experience having lived in many areas of the U.S. We see the side of Jim  often ommited. He was a conservative in may ways, ambitious, an erudite,  who was extremely well read. an I.Q. 0f 140. Jim, if not for stardom and  its subsequent addictions that lead to his death could have had success in  many realms. What is perplexing, is that he read Nietzche and understood  him.	1998-11-24

There is joy and sadness in the story of McQueen. He overcame the odds from an emotionally painful childhood, living  on the streets at the age of 15. Mcqueen had worked many odd jobs all over  the United States before joining the Marines. He decided to try acting  instead of taking a woodworking job in Spain. From then on you can't put  this book down unitl the story of his life is over. Kudos to Terril, and I  hope he plans on giving us more biographical brilliance.	1998-11-08

Mosley has a great knack for chatacter development and paints a plot that makes it hard o put this story down.
