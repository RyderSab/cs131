US	51215763	RP8AUEX8I7OR5	0812550390	998489163	The Listeners	Books	4	9	9	N	N	pretty engaging	i've read almost all of Christopher Pike's other books so i consider myself a sound voice of criticsm regarding his books. i liked this one. it was engaging and easy to read throughout. i don't see what makes it an adult book besides occasional swearing and some very mild nudity - take those bits out and it could pass as one of his teen books. which is just fine, because it made it incredibly easy to read. i liked David Conner and enjoyed his characterization as well as that of his boss, Ned, and Dr. Spears, the guy heading the Listeners movement. Spears especially had some interesting stuff going on; pity he couldn't be explored more in depth. <BR>the one thing i didn't like was Lucy Temple, David's love interest. could anyone be more annoying? she was such an... sometimes. and Margaret was a little much...for obvious reasons, after you read the book. but you know, that's just the way he writes.<BR>generally speaking, there are some recurring Pike themes in this book - an ancient evil, a greater spiritual SOMETHING that's out there, the power of love blah blah blah. if you feel like you've been there, done that, then don't read this book. but if you like Pike's writing style (smooth and easy like hot chocolate, yum) then you'll enjoy this one.	2002-10-19
US	51215763	REB3H7P9LTOTN	0812510488	745081288	The Season of Passage	Books	1	7	36	N	N	incredibly bad	i can't stand this book. the characters were cold and empty, and unbelieveable. the saintliness of jennifer wagner made me want to vomit. this book is just like Pike's other teen horror novels, which normally would be fine, but since it's stretched out to adult novel proportions, it is incredibly long and unbearable. i feel cheated of the hours i wasted reading this book, which is just a rehashing of Pike's usual themes. if you are a young reader and love Christopher Pike, you will probably enjoy this book and think i am crazy for not liking it. but if you are like me, an old Christopher Pike fan from back in the day who, now older & wiser, recognizes the same-ness of all of his writing (in that it's pretty bland because he applies a similar formula to every story) then steer clear!!! take my warning for what it is. I SO wish someone else had told me not to read this book.	2002-10-12

Goldberg is nothing compared to Frederick!!! sigh. and i thought the ending was just really anti-climactic. <BR>anyway, this book is fine. but it's not the best. not by far.	2002-10-01

Despite a typical, mediocre build-up, the ending was a surprise. i would actually just give this book 3.5 stars, but since amazon doesn't let us do half ratings, i had to round up. and i'll give the book the benefit of being aimed for pre-teens & such. it's not so great now that i'm 21 and loving books like The Lovely Bones (soooo amazingly good) but i know if i had read this book back when i was thirteen, i would have thought it was great. If you're a fan of Christopher Pike, you'll definitely like this one.	2002-09-02

Merry is just like, \\"Yeah so then this is what happened and that's that, and now it's all settled but oh no, i still have to get pregnant and have sex with all these guys.\\" the only people who are going to read this book and read it all the way through are hardcore LKH fans like myself who just have to read this stuff to keep up with the storyline in hopes that LKH will finish up her series with the same skills she started Anita Blake with.	2002-05-18
US	51215763	R1YDAV7OYTH3XI	0671550772	207756552	The Grave : A Novel	Books	1	1	5	N	N	sub-par and awful	To allow you to understand where i am coming from, let me first say that I have read almost all of CHristopher Pike's book in the past, and throughout my years have considered him to be an extremely fine writer. That said, let me now go on to describe why The Grave is CP's worst effort to date. And you can't even say, \\"Well it's still better than a lot of other stuff out there,\\" because it's NOT! It's THAT BAD! The characters are two dimensional, the incredibly boring revivals of characters we've encountered in the past - the interesting, soulful guy, the cute but still sexy in her own way poor girl next door, and the good looking but evil for whatever reason (usually b/c of something that happened in the past or an alternate universe) bad guy(s).  The plot is terrible too. it lacked suspense and was incredibly uninteresting. at least before, in CP's earlier books, everything felt somewhat believable, the way he could incorporate mysticism and spirituality with the madness of science. but this book!!!! this book falls flat on its face!!! i don't know if he was even trying - i have to agree with the other reviewers that said his books have started to take an ugly turn for the worse. I mean, I hated his Final Friends series, but at least those were written with some kind of style. This one is a horrible remashing of things he's written before, and the only reason it got published is because it's under the Christopher Pike name.  But diehard fans will still read this and buy it, and fans who have yet to have an discerning judgment will still crow that \\"This book is the best!\\" But for those of you who find it harder to find books worthy of rave reviews, steer clear of this one! Among my favorite CP books are The Remember Me series (well, the 3rd one wasn't so hot), The Midnight Game, Whisper of Death, and any others from around that period. For the newbie fans, steer clear of the earliest ones and the most recent ones. The middle ones were his hey-day. You can tell he really hit his groove then.  Oh and if you want a REALLY awesome read, read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton. Wooo those things are hard to put down!	2001-07-12

The characters are poorly developed, with this whole sense of things happening from out of nowhere. At first it's like, &quot;lalala we are respectful enemies&quot; and then it's like &quot;Wham! Bam! I love you!&quot;  The way things occur without any real build-up just seems incredibly ridiculous. Readers are given plotlines without any real development, and it is due to that manner of storytelling that the book suffers. But the thing is, i know Bujold is supposed to be a great writer because she won a couple of Hugo awards or whatever, and those are really great, ie they really say something about the quality of work. Therefore...i'm going to give Bujold another shot and read the one that got the award in the first place. if it sucks, then i give up. To each their own, after all...	2001-05-03

The characters are, per usual for OSC, extremely well developed, esp.  considering how short this book actually is, and the whole story just  streams forward. the world created is really original, and i was all set to  give this book 5 stars til I got to the ending. there is a DEFINITE gross  out factor in the ending, i was seriously repulsed, i think i may have  trouble sleeping tonight, ugh. well, i may exaggerate, others may not think  it's so bad, but for me i was just like NASTY NASTy YUCK. and while the  ending ties up the loose strings, something about it left me dissatisfied;  it just seemed too pat. but overall this is a very good book, it's about a  thousand times better than most junk you read out there. if you're an OSC  fan, or just a fan of intriguing, gripping fantasy, read this book!<br />and  lastly, regarding the reviewer that gave this book 1 star and said that it  involved &quot;the hero's raping a barely postpubescent girl in  public&quot; ...well s/he kind of muddled that part of the book, cuz it had  nothing to do with &quot;to become heir to her father's throne&quot;, as  s/he stated. so ignore this confused reviewer, and go with the general high  regard by which this book is held by most reviewers so far. have fun,  cheers	2000-08-06

US	51215763	R1BAANG3Z93RD9	0671886096	151266149	Sacred Country	Books	5	11	11	N	N	absolutely brilliant	when i heard that we had to read a book about a girl who wants to become a boy for english class, my first instinct was that the book would be bad, a simple stereotypical novel that would fail to convey more than that. in  fact, it turned out to be quite the contrary. i should have had more faith  in my teacher. anyway, this book is simply marvelous. the story is about so  much more than just Mary/Martin; the quest for identity affects Tim and  Walter as well. all the characters in this book are so real and each  amazing in his or her own way. i know this is a poor review and does not do  the novel justice, but i just wanted to add my 5 stars to the average. this  book is not to be missed.	2000-03-15

Her characters are wholly believeable, with that earnestness  that makes you wish you knew them. i liked this book a lot. i wish i could  find it again in the library to reread it.	2000-02-04

US	51215763	R2NFQQGGUUMUZA	0590442562	603618071	Weekend (Point)	Books	3	1	3	N	N	eh, it was ok	i have to agree wtih the reviewer who said Pike's earlier works sucked, cuz it's true. his books verged on terrible. i'm not sure when the whole Final Friends series was written but it was HORRIBLE. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT, DO NOT READ IT!  save yourself the trouble &amp; go read his  Remember Me series! that one was nice. or any of his later stuff, at least  late 80s early 90s. anyway, i digress.  Weekend is a decent book in that it  is an intriguing Christopher Pike plot in that you can you just plow  through the book without putting it down. but the essential storyline,  while vaguely interesting, isn't exactly edge of your seat material. maybe  it's cuz i've read so much of his stuff throughout my adolescense and i now  verge at the end of adolesence and therefore am so familiar with his  plotlines, that i can now read through his plotlines a lot more easily.  Meaning, i already guessed half of the book's outcome within the first few  chapters. but for those of you who are like, 12 yrs old and just beginning  with Christopher Pike, i'm sure you'll like Weekend well enough. it's  certainly not as good as his later works, but it's a decent read compared  to the other stuff that's out there.	2000-01-23

I found it extremely moving, and at certain key points, i even became teary eyed. i thought it was incredibly interesting how OSC incorporated historical figures into his  version of revolutionary/developing America. really cool.

Prentice Alvin was a MAJOR disappointemnt, and this one, well, Alvin Journeyman is only slightly better than its predecessor. But still, even though these books are going  downhill, i can't help myself, I HAVE to know what happens to alvin and the  crystal city!  i rank this book 3 stars not because it's so terrible, but  because it doesn't rank among the 5 stars i'm used to getting from OSC.  Hart's Hope was EXCELLENT, and so was Ender's Game. THat's the kind of  quality i love. But i digress. Nevertheless, the Alvin Maker series is  intriguing, despite the occasional bad plot twist and whatnot. hopefully  Heartfire is better. right now i'm feeling like there's not enough  character development to support the amount of characters OSC has  introduced in Alvin Journeyman.	1999-12-26

Hart's Hope flows easily and it's just enchanting. The world OSC has created is unique, and while it deals with the usual hero has to save the  world sort of plot, everything is given a new twist. Wonderful. i think if  i'd read thsi when i was younger (i'm 19), i would have found it to be more  haunting, but i wouldn't have understood it as well as i do now, and as it  is, i was still left a little confused. or not confused per se, but really  thinking. anyway, props to OSC, this was a really remarkable tale. i loved  all the characters.	1999-11-25

Whatever, it was  decent, i didn't like it that much, and is it just me or has his  characterization gotten a little sloppy? i felt that he was starting to  recycle a certain formula.

This book was so intriguing and really touching - it was almost like magic. i could really believe in  the characters. in comparison, it was almost odd to read Remember Me later  on because in the first one the characters and plot are much more like a  regular mystery/scary novel type deal, while i had found Remember me 2 to  be very spiritual, an aspect that i really enjoy about C.P.'s books, like  The Midnight Club and that sort. it's really interesting how he can swing  both ways. ah, to be that talented...	1999-06-11

I didn't like Aerin but i did like her name, and I did like her with Luthe but not with Tor, though I like both Luthe &amp; Tor (Though  I like Luthe better). Anyway, I just reread the book now that i am 18 and i  like Aerin better now too. And I still like her better with Luthe.<br />I read  Robin McKinley's other book, Deerskin, a few days ago, and i was struck by  the books' parallels. I tried to read The Blue Sword once but i wasn't too  into the main character so i stopped. but i think i'll try again  soon.<br />The Hero and the Crown is a really good book, especially if you're  young and dreaming of dragons and magic. I love Luthe. I think he is like,  my ideal. Anyway, I'm only giving this book 4 stars though because I find  the story is...odd sometimes. Like i didn't notice it when i was younger,  but now that i'm older and more well-read, i do find it a bit choppier of a  sort...like it's not exactly the perfect story. But I still love Luthe, and  it's still an awesome read.<br />Sorry if my review sounds so muddled. it's  late and i'm tired...	1999-03-27

I sympathized with Bandit's inability to fit in as an immigrant, and stuff like that, scenes like that, just  makes me feel that this book is a worthwhile read. I'd give it 4-4 1/2  stars but i went with 5 here since they don't offer a 1/2 rating and i  wanted to up the average score anyway. =)	1999-03-08

It was ok. it was written in the usual eccentric vonnegut style, but i couldn't really get into it like I did with Bluebeard. Maybe i'm not reading into it deeply enough, i'm sure that's part of the case, but  whatever. I found the whole tumor imagery especially disturbing, but i have  to say that Rudy's playlets were hilarious.	1999-03-07
US	51215763	R3H77IFRRD8TWK	0553279300	166854560	Being There	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Weird	this book is strange. i read it on the recommendation of a really literate friend, but maybe this book was just too deep for me. I got the general gist of it, like underlying commentary about society and stuff, but  dude...I just couldn't get into it. But i mean, if you're really into weird  esoteric fantastical situations...give it a try. it's always better to  create your own opinion about these things.	1999-02-19

I finished the book in almost a day (i would have finished it straight but i had to go to class and eat dinner and such). It's not like something that's  so gripping you can't put it down, it's more like it's just something  that's so GOOD you don't want to stop. I really enjoyed it, and i'm  definitely going to be reading some more Vonnegut in the very near future.	1999-02-19
US	51215763	RHW59KECVME27	0553375407	350438534	Ishmael:A Novel	Books	3	0	0	N	N	4 stars for the ideas, but 0 stars for the narrative	this book sucks. it has absolutely no literary merit whatsoever and is a major pain in the ass to read through. however, read through it I did and i'm actually glad I did because the ideas don't really get going until the  last quarter of the book. Essentially, the first 3/4s are drivel,  no-brainer stuff than anyone ought to know but Daniel Quinn feels is  necessary to repeat and restate in a question-answer format (that is so  annoying!) for the benefit of all. But the ideas that Daniel Quinn presents  us and the evidence he offers are really innovative and interesting.  Overall, it was decent. his ideas saved the book, but this story is  absolute garbage.	1999-01-28

Beagle's use of language is one I can respect and maybe even appreciate for what it is, but i just cannot enjoy  it. I never felt the true flow of the story. In fact, there were a lot of  times when i found all the characters to be quite annoying. All in all, I  thought the book was ok. The plot was very imaginative and such, but it  just didn't appeal to me at all. But hey, if anyone wants to talk to me  about this and explain what i may have missed, feel free to e-mail me.	1999-01-17

I had to read it about 3 years ago and I thought it was incredible; I would get so teary-eyed over parts. Looking back, I can admit to its melodrama and that Harriet Beecher Stowe probably never  saw a plantation in her life, but that doesn't take away from the fact that  this book was revolutionary and its time and changed a lot of views.  Everyone should read this book because it's not just a great story - it's a  part of our history.	1998-11-02

I was disappointed with it, but i read it so long ago i can't remember exactly why. Just be warned: This is no Bridge to Terabithia. I haven't read any of Katherine Paterson's other books but i plan to, simply in hopes of recapturing the magic found in TBTT.	1998-04-29

I've followed the Warlock series for awhile and I think this has to be the worst, if not one of the worst in the seris. it was terrible. I mean, it felt that Christopher stasheff was trying to pull stuff out of his butt to make it into a working story like the prior Warlock books, but i just didn't buy it. It didn't feel right to me. Currently i am awaiting the book about Gregory, my personal Gallowglass fave, and i'm hoping it'll be up to Stasheff's old standards.	1998-04-09

HELLO!!! HOw could pretty much everyone here rate this book 9-10???? It was NOT THAT GOOD. My reason is because MARY-LYNETTE S****D&gt; she was another one of LJ's cheesy perfect charactesr and the fact taht she ended up with the vampire hottie was blah, too predictable. It was way too &quot;Happy Ending&quot; for me.	1998-04-04
