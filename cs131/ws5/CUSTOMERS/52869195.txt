He offers the clearest explanations of how meter, line length, and rhyme influence tone and meaning in a poem. His section on forms is absolutely the most comprehensive, explaining how to make formal verse into GOOD poetry beyond simply following the technical rules. Suggestions include writing the envoi first in a sestina, shaping meaning in a pantoum, and how to make the repeating lines of a villanelle do multiple tasks. I agree with the reviewer who said she'd want this book if stranded on a island. I can't read more than a page without stopping to write and I know that I've produced several publishable poems. I also know what I can do to revise poems that I knew didn't work, but wasn't sure how to fix them before reading this book. Excellent! I couldn't be more enthusiastic.	2004-09-09

Using the simple and familiar, Susan K. Perry shows us how we can turn the most ordinary experiences into opportunities for creativity, learning, and fun, teaching children to begin a lifelong love of education and imagination.  A walk becomes an adventure into biology and nature as well as a chance to make up stories about people, to notice change in daily surroundings.  The backyard is filled with learning how to grow edible and decorative plants with an aesthetic appreciation of their variety and arrangement, along with respect for other living creatures.  Cooking with your children, you can both learn about nutrition, health, and safety, fostering good habits that will serve them well in our fast food and junk food culture.  Waiting in line and long car rides become openings for psychological sharing and excursions into the imagination.<br />Nearly all of the ideas in this book can be used by adults to stimulate their own creativity and get out of their daily ruts.  I especially appreciated the sections of doing dreamwork and personal journaling with children.

Instead, I am happy to say that THE CLITORAL TRUTH makes information about women's anatomy and responsiveness more comprehensible than most books that make the same claims.  I was particularly happy to see that the author tackles the issues of G-Spots and female ejaculation by relying on women's experience instead of the academic doubts of male \\"experts\\" who seem to have very limited experience with women. The reality of a range of responses in women, depending on their beliefs, circumstances, and level of arousal, reminds us all that what we are TOLD we do is usually very different from what we KNOW we do.  This is true whether we talk about female ejaculation, multiple orgasm, ability to self-pleasure to orgasm, or teach our partners what we want and like.  Her list of resources, books, Internet sites, and workshops is wonderful.<br />This book is a terrific companion to Betty Dodson's SEX FOR ONE: THE JOY OF SELF-LOVING.<br />~~Joan Mazza, author of Dream Back Your Life; Dreaming Your Real Self; Who's Crazy Anyway; and Exploring Your Sexual Self (a guided journal).	2001-04-05

IF THE BUDDHA DATED is my latest addition to my list of these little paper gems.  Kasl knows what she's talking about.  Without dogma or fuzzy affirmations, she reminds us in clear language that our relationships are part of our spiritual journey.  Her definition of a spiritual journey in the path we take to be who we truly are, without pretense or attempts to please lovers, family members, or other authority figures.  We come to learn that we can love and be loved best by being who we truly are, showing our vulnerability and our humanity, while still expecting to be treated with consideration, compassion, and kindness.  <br />Early in the book, she states, \\"on the spiritual path, the purpose of any relationship is to wake up and get to know ourselves and our lover, thoroughly, without judgment or pride.\\"  And, \\"Dating with a Buddhist consciousness means a willingness to confront anything inside that kindles fear or anxiety. When we start wanting to run away, be deceptive, tell lies, or put on a mask, we need to walk right into our fears, sit down, and talk to them until they become our friends. That doesn't mean we have a goal of getting rid of fear; rather we accept it as part of our unfolding journey.\\" I couldn't agree more.<br />Her lists of behaviors for us to examine in our partners and ourselves are excellent and straightforward.  A close examination of what we want and what we have to offer, our values and our desires, all play into what makes relationships work or not.  She says, \\"True commitment is born of knowledge.  We can't say yes to what we don't know.\\"<br />Her list of questions to explore with your partner before becoming sexual (page 126) are excellent.

While I disagreed with several of the comments, they challenged my thinking.  I also agreed with many of the statements, based on my own experience as a therapist and from my personal encounters as well.<br />These different viewpoints and perspectives reflect how our feelings and beliefs about sexuality change with age and experience.  By their very diversity, we see again how people can be more open and more accepting as they mature, as well as how individual and unique each person's lovemap can be.<br />The comments are divided by chapter into groups such as communication, body, attraction, contraception, love, relationship, desire, pleasure, and masturbation, among others.  I found those about love and falling in love the most thought provoking, and took issue the most on the section on communication.  Many of the experts in this collection cautioned about sharing sexual secrets.  I believe whether one finds this kind of confession repulsive, frightening, alarming, intimate, or erotic (or some combination) will depend on the participants and the specific contours of their individual lovemaps.  I completely disagreed with, \\"You shouldn't tell men anything about other lovers before you had them.  The jealous ones will get nasty.  The non-jealous ones will think you are tacky.\\"  (page 7)  Certainly, there are lots of other possible reactions, including enjoying hearing about your past!

US	52869195	R1Q2LTCINHIUFV	0813330823	19660900	Sexual Consent	Books	5	13	13	N	Y	Clearly informs our personal lives	In discussions of gay rights, unconventional sex, and concerns about the sexual freedoms of young people, the elderly, and the disabled, we frequently hear the term \\"consenting adults.\\"  Philosopher and author, David Archard, tackles the question of giving sexual consent and who can give it.  He states that in order to offer valid consent, the individual must be capable, informed and voluntary.  This logically excludes anyone who is unconscious or whose consciousness is clouded by drugs, alcohol, medication, or mental disability.  Likewise, those who are underage are incapable of giving valid consent because they are unable to understand what it means.  Even if informed of the particulars (expectations, possible consequences, etc.) they may lack the judgment to make the decision or be persuaded by someone simply because of that person's power and authority.  \\"Informed\\" refers to any pertinent information that might impact on giving consent, such as knowing the other person is in a committed and exclusive relationship, has an STD, or holds an expectation that the sexual encounter will include specific behaviors.  By voluntary, the consent must not be coerced by threats (overt or covert) of violence or other threats (to reputation, job, or economic security) in the present or future.<br />While each of these elements seems straightforward, their applications may not be so simple, as the author points out with many examples.  Such problems include the age of consent -- at what point is any individual capable of giving consent and do certain circumstances (such as homosexual contact, appearing in pornographic film, or intergenerational sex) warrant a different age?  Similarly, how does one determine what is truly voluntary in light of serious economic and social pressures to acquiesce?<br />Archard examines gender inequality, incest, prostitution, rape, and sadomasochism, offering a consistently logical and respectful approach without moralizing or repudiating any affectional preference.  He distinguishes between what the law accepts as consent from a morality of consent that acknowledges the sexual autonomy of individuals.  He does not make a personal case for any particular position, but rather examines the finer points that might constitute valid consent in any sexual encounter.<br />SEXUAL CONSENT is a philosophy book, not pop-psychology or popular politics.  I found the discussions of specifics enlightening and thought-provoking.  In particular, I appreciated the discussion of the more subtle forms of coercion -- those that are so much a part of our hierarchical society and its institutions that we may be unaware of them.  Archard offers excellent arguments and explanations for those who see themselves as sexually liberated.<br />In all, I enjoyed this book very much.

He sees the desire of gays and lesbians to marry as part of their desire to be accepted as \\"normal\\" and a part of mainstream culture.  The desire for marriage comes about in many of the same ways for gays and lesbians as it does for heterosexuals.  Marriage, in Warner's words, is yoked to the benefits of status, respectability, and other countless privileges, such as health care, housing and tax preferences, and parental rights.  He recommends separating these rights from legal marriage, which the state already regulates in ways that are too intimate and controlling.  He says we should redefine &quot;family to reflect the reality of people's [extended] relationships.&quot; (page 120) Many states still have laws prohibiting oral, anal, and group sex, even for married persons.  Warner describes most eloquently how gay marriage is likely to alienate other sexual \\"deviants\\" who are lower on the sexual hierarchy, such as prostitutes and other sex workers, transgendered persons, and others.  Those who prefer some kind of public sex or \\"who aspire to a different kind of sexual maturity besides that of a married couple\\" will be further ostracized and demonized by the split in the LGBTQ communities into those who are married and those who are not (and don't want to be).  This split mirrors what has already happened to people in the heterosexual communities who choose intimacies that are different from those who are choose traditional marriage.  For non-gay populations, this would include \\"queers\\" who are polyamorous, bisexual, and celibate.  Warner's analysis of the politics of shame applies to all \\"sexual outlaws.\\"  He raises important questions of sex education for everyone.  He advocates the continued availability of public places where all kinds of sexual information is shared without fear of arrest or attack and where people might meet and mingle with those who share their preferences and passions.<br />THE TROUBLE WITH NORMAL was, for me, a whole education in sexual freedom and autonomy, showing how the politics of sexual shame and the desire to \\"fit in\\" hurts us all.  In particular, sexual shame and the push to appear \\"normal\\" harms those who are HIV positive or at greater risk for STDs because of the growing paucity of sexual information in the public sphere.<br />~~Joan Mazza, author of Dream Back Your Life; Dreaming Your Real Self; Who's Crazy Anyway; and Exploring Your Sexual Self (a guided journal).	2001-01-21

William Wright tackles the link between genes and behavior in plain language.  He makes it clear that as human beings with consciousness and choice, genes do not dictate behavior, but contribute to it.  He separates the politics of the fear regarding genetic research from what we know and how we know it and how we use new information.  He also discusses how researchers might avoid some methodological hazards or the accusation of fudged data (document everything!).<br />He says, \\"Most scientists take the position that knowledge is neutral, value free; the use to which it is put might be good or bad, beneficial or hurtful to society in general.  First, learn as much as we can, then let society decide how new information will be used. The opponents of behavioral genetics have consistently feared such a climate of unfettered inquiry.\\" (p. 215)<br />Much of this book focuses on twin studies, but Wright also describes some of the research on hormone levels and their effects.  He attempts to tease out the variables of nature and nurture on specific behaviors such as intelligence, depression, and a tendency toward violence.<br />My reading of this book sparked a frenzy of my reading other books on twins, homosexuality, and other research on the links between genes, environment, and behavior.

Beginning with a distinction between genital dysfunctions and the arousal disorders, Dr. Kaplan proceeds through the importance of getting a complete and accurate picture of the patient's past and present experience that contribute to reduced or absent desire.  After evaluation and a full understanding of the patient's goals for treatment, Dr. Kaplan moves into treatment strategies, using homework and other behavioral suggestions.  She uses the exploration of underlying psychoanalytic causes only when the shorter-term solution-focused, behavioral treatments fail to make significant changes.  The very readable case histories are a cross section of problems in this area and of Dr. Kaplan's innovative and individualized techniques for offering help.  Her comfort with all areas of sexual behavior, anatomy, and individual preferences comes through in every sentence.<br />I was especially impressed by Dr. Kaplan's consideration of some people's lack of motivation in having insights into their personality patterns and behavior.  She demonstrates admirable respect for people whose religious beliefs or ethnic norms prevent them from following some of her suggestions to fantasize, share fantasies, masturbate, or use erotica.  In each case, she reframed the suggestion so that it was in keeping with the patient's values or she changed the assignment so that it was acceptable to the patient.  Her understanding and respect that many couples have successful relationships that they want to maintain but that we, as therapists, might not want for ourselves, provided excellent role modeling for those who read her book.  She also doesn't claim 100% success and is willing to discuss some of her treatment failures and why she thought she was ineffective-the mark of a true scientist.<br />~~Joan Mazza, author of Dream Back Your Life; Dreaming Your Real Self; Things That Tick Me Off; Who's Crazy, Anyway? and Exploring Your Sexual Self.	2000-12-28

And those places where you do so will be the places that hold your essay back, the places where your essay is dying to teach you something.\\"<br />This book is organized and indexed (thank you!) and the author reminds us of the importance of regular reading.  A list of suggested titles to inspire and challenge you is at the end of the book.<br />Sprinkled with humor and wit, WRITING LIFE STORIES is an excellent addition to any writer's library and makes a wonderful text for any basic writing class, including fiction.

In this anthology, writers talk about their most personal experiences of themselves as sexual beings: the gender they feel they are-sometimes in contrast to their physical bodies, what sexual experiences feel in synch with their arousal, and how each of these are changeable over the course of a lifetime.<br />None of the authors fit the general expectation of lesbian, gay, bi, or transgendered.  If a self-identified lesbian and a gay man are partnered sexually, how do they then define themselves?  Why are bisexuals so often discriminated against by gays and lesbians as well as by the general public?  And in terms of being part of a community, how do others label them?<br />Understanding the fluidity of desire and identity can reveal these mysteries, which challenge the queer community as well as mainstream folks who worry about how children will be raised and what makes a family.<br />\\"PoMo\\" refers to postmodern as the editors articulate so well on page 21 \\"Postmodern thought invites us to get used to the Zen notion of \\"multiple subjectivies\\" ---the idea that there is no solid, objective reality, that each of us experiences our reality subjectively affected (or influenced) by our unique circumstances.  This mode of thought encourages overlapping and sometimes contradictory realities, a life of investigation and questioning as opposed to essentialism's quest for the One Truth, the innate quality, indubitable facts on a silver platter, the answer to everything.\\"<br />Each essay is honest, thoughtful, and very well written.  I enjoyed this book more than I would have guessed and look forward to reading other work by the individual authors.<br />~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY; THINGS THAT TICK ME OFF; and EXPLORING YOUR SEXUAL SELF, A GUIDED JOURNAL (May 2001).	2000-11-14

We couldn't be more different.  But I loved this book: her tales and struggles, how she has become part of a community of believers without a lot of dogma and fanfare.  I loved the descriptions of people in her church and how they help each other, her concerns and deep love for her child, and the losses she's been through.  I am astonished that, given her background, she has written books that can be so helpful to others.  Like her earlier book, BIRD BY BIRD, this one inspires and teaches through her human fears and doubts.<br />I would recommend this to writing students because Lamott demonstrates how writing about the details of your life in your own voice can make even the simplest events compelling and interesting.<br />~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY? and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books.	2000-11-01

This classic hit me at the right time (1996), when I was ready to take a step toward what I most wanted to do with my life: write books, get published, and teach.  The phrases that hit me hardest was \\"being caught up in the thick of thin things\\" and \\"It's easy to say no when you have a bigger YES burning inside you.\\"  These ideas propelled me to focus seriously on my writing and make the first move to get an agent-with considerable success so far, as you can see below.<br />Covey reminds us of what is important: expanding our sphere of influence, leaving a legacy, listening and loving, living by our principles.  He never says it's easy or that you will be \\"enlightened,\\" but for me, this book was truly enlightening.  Covey's words made the difference between planning my future and moving into it whole-heartedly.  There is so much that's helpful in this book that I can return to it whenever I feel at loose ends.<br />~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY? and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books, columnist and features writer for Personal Journaing Magazine.	2000-11-01

First, the essays or books have been chosen for publication and then a few are picked for the collection.  These are well written and interesting, covering several areas of science.  I especially liked Stephen S. Hall's \\"Journey to the Center of My Mind\\" where he describes his experience of an M.R.I. of his brain while being assigned specific mental tasks.  Fascinating stuff.  And I loved \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" excerpted from Jonathan Weiner's terrific book, TIME, LOVE, MEMORY, on Seymour Benzer's mapping the genes of the fruit fly.<br />Each essay in this collection takes you into the world of a specific science and the scientists who are patient enough to stay with their explorations and articulate enough to describe them to others.

People who participated in the studies showed improved immune function as measured by doctor visits compared to controls groups who didn't journal or who journaled about daily events and omitted their feelings.<br />If you've kept a journal and written about what troubles you, you know how much this unloading can improve your mood.  It's nice to have someone listen to you, or to have the compassionate attention of a paid therapist who can help you see your patterns. But it's also comforting to know that science has shown that journaling can be a way for you to be your own therapist.  In this book, the author shares stories of people and their writing.  This is a good book to point to if anyone thinks journaling is just narcissistic scribbling.<br />     ~~Joan Mazza, psychotherapist and author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY? and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books/Walking Stick Press.	2000-10-26

During our lives, we see ourselves differently at different times.  What makes us who we are is complicated, interesting, and often surprising. Author Kate Bornstein reminds us that the simple dichotomy that most people want in gender simply doesn't exist.  Asking ourselves the hard questions helps us see ourselves and others as people-beyond gender and its expectations.  This is a refreshing book in a society that wants to place everyone into neat little boxes. ~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY? and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books/Walking Stick Press.	2000-10-26

We all need to be reminded to show the action in scene, rather than tell about it, using specific details and memorable character quirks.  Kelton comes at revision from several different perspectives, each one refining the work, making it more inviting to readers and easy to understand.  Most important, she notes that the writers who succeed are those who persevere, accept suggestions with an open mind, and trust they will find their own writing voice.  Those who are discouraged by a few rejections likely want to be writers more than they want to WRITE.  I will recommend this book in the next writing workshop I teach.

By allowing ourselves to tell the whole truth of our experiences and their emotional impact, we arrive at a new view of our life and its meaning.  I especially liked her dos and don'ts on page 26-27.  I also appreciated her counsel about ways to take care of oneself while dredging up old hurts and painful experiences, seeing our strengths along the way.  Every page shows her sensitivity, consideration, and wisdom in guiding us to heal ourselves.  Journal entries provide the seeds for other writing as well as helping us to come to terms with our past.

Each author talks about the process of discovering different ways to tell their own stories and then subjecting their stories to a critical analysis, understanding that it might be told differently.  They consider how the author knows too much and must distill this glut of information into a dramatic, readable narrative that will hold a reader.  That means using many of the techniques of fiction, but also being true to the events.  The examples prompted me to buy several of the memoirs discussed.  This book would be very helpful for anyone considering writing a memoir and it's a terrific cross-section of the genre for anyone wanting to read some of the best.  ~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE, DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF, and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest.	2000-09-25

We understand the truth of them, but putting them into practice  is more difficult.  I know not to take things personally, that whatever  anyone does or says tells me more about that person than it does about me.   I know it intellectually, but living it and feeling it are something else.   My reactions tell me that I DO take things, personally, even as I am able  to tell myself otherwise.  Ruiz helps us get past that dilemma.  Similarly,  I DO make assumptions and have to remind myself to check them out, at  least, if I can't stop assuming and interpreting.  I can ask, Is this what  you meant?  But speaking our truth also means being aware of the power of  our words.  All of these concepts are part of doing our best, the fourth  agreement.  Ruiz's explanations of these four simple truths take us a step  closer to the ideal of living by them.  A book to re-read and ponder,  remembering to be gentle with ourselves as we strive to do better. ~Joan  Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE and DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF	2000-09-08

I was able to see how my own fear of  change keeps me stuck, having less (emotionally and experientially) than I  would if I would embrace change and new adventures.  When I got to the  question, \\"What would you do if you weren't afraid?\\" an answer popped into  my head that astounded me.

Rowling  captures the concerns of children and adults everywhere-the desire to be  wanted and accepted, to feel safe, to be appreciated, have good friends, to  learn and have adventures.  The characters are distinct, memorable, and  charming in original ways.  I love the all-flavor beans, the Quidditch  matches, Dobby's self-punishing behavior, and polyjuice potion.

Fear can keep us from submitting our work, writing with any depth at all,  being honest-even from being honest with ourselves.  Ralph Keyes knows what  he's talking about.  He writes about fear with sensitivity, while he offers  a variety of solutions.  He knows that getting a book accepted and  published only opens up a whole new variety of fears.  Whether we are  published or not, we can use our fears to deepen our writing by sharing our  personal truths candidly with others, letting go of our need to be admired,  approved of, or liked by friends and family.  If we worry about what others  will think, we will never do our best writing.  Keyes helps us to be honest  with ourselves so that we can be naked on the page.

Sobel tells the story of solving the problem of measuring  longitude from both a human angle and a technical one.  She shows how all  the political shenanigans of these so-called gentlemen kept the prize from  its rightful claimant for decades.  Especially interesting were the  alternative attempts at measuring longitude, some of them illogical and  wacky at best.  This benefit of hindsight makes me wonder which of our  \\"solutions\\" to problems will look equally inept a hundred years from  now.<br />Sobel's scientific descriptions are wonderfully clear and  understandable.

Each character feels like a real person and their snappy  interactions are entertaining and educational.  I loved these people and  really cared about what happened to them.  I wish I could be at one of  Anne's dinner parties.  This novel explores how even well meaning,  educated, and prudent people can make big mistakes -believing they know  more than they do.  Masterfully done, it raises questions of ecology,  politics, religion, power, faith, and very human desires.  Although, as  readers, we think we know the outcome of the mission to Rakhat, we are  continually surprised at how the events really played out, gradually  revealed by Sandoz -as complex a character as any human can be.  In the  equally riveting sequel, Children of God, he returns to Rakhat to discover  the enormous impact the first mission had on the two sentient species  there.  Books to savor and ponder, to ask ourselves how we each make  similar errors all the time - even with the best of intentions.	2000-06-28

I loved the detailed descriptions of the  different personalities that contribute to the tipping phenomenon.  It  helps explain the success (and failure) of so many people's attempts to  make a public impact.  The concept of context, especially the \\"magic\\"  number of 150, was in keeping with what I know about people living in  intentional communities.  Translating these ideas into positive \\"sticky\\"  life choices has enormous potential for social change and personal  satisfaction that most people can only get a glimpse of in their personal  lives.  **Very thought provoking.**  I want to recommend it to everyone I  can think of- and for very different reasons!	2000-06-11

The details of  how the dictionary was assembled-in the days before even the simplest of  computer technology-and the history of the people involved held my  interest.  What could have simply been a dry description had all the drama  and pathos of a literary novel instead.  Simon Winchester shows how someone  can have a pocket of mental illness and still be healthy and productive in  other ways.	2000-06-11

I laughed so hard that I had to put the book down until I composed  myself enough to see the print again.  Bryson tells a hilarious story of  his attempt at walking the Appalachian Trail- replete with quirky  characters and wonder at the beauty of nature.  I loved his descriptions of  Katz.  He's convinced me that any fantasy I ever had about hiking the Trail  should remain a fantasy, but at least I got to enjoy *his* walk in the  woods.	2000-06-11

I read this straight  through in one day-a rare event for me, since I always read several very  different books at a time.  FIRST YOU HAVE TO ROW A LITTLE BOAT had me  totally engaged and I kept marking paragraphs and writing WOW in the  margins.  On page 145 he says, \\"If every man and woman were to take the  meaning of their life and pursue it passionately, they would alter the  social landscape overnight.  In fact, that's how lasting revolutions are  made-not by the raised arm of the masses, not by the military seizure of  power, not by the political coup d'Ã©tat, but by individuals asserting who  they are one at a time.\\"  WOW.<br />His use of sailing as metaphor worked  beautifully for me, even though I don't sail.  His comments (page 32) about  listening to the wind instead of holding tightly to dogma and rigidity were  eloquent bordering on poetry.  Very inspiring.	2000-06-11

It offers good descriptions of various therapies and how they work.  The language of  this book has a very academic, clinical tone, which makes its valuable  information a bit dry to assimilate.  Some cautions about the therapeutic  process are discussed, but not enough on the ways to tell if you, as a  patient, are with an inappropriate or wacky therapist.  I found it a good  book with only a few reservations.	2000-05-10

A review from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: Transforming Dream Messages into Life Action--A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND FANTASIES.<br />When Carl Sagan passed away, I wished other scientists would  step in to bring science to the public in an engaging, readable way and  with Sagan's enthusiasm and hope.  Matt Ridley's GENOME is a great read,  taking an optimistic view of genetic research and its benefits to us all.   While we worry about cloning and interfering with DNA, Ridley tells us what  such research can mean to help us lead healthier lives while working within  the limitations of the genes we have.  I especially enjoyed his explanation  that we have choices and are not determined solely by our genes.  By  knowing whatever genetic shortcomings we have, we are able to alter our  diets, exercise, and education to compensate for them.  I've read Ridley's  other books as well-THE RED QUEEN and THE ORIGINS OF VIRTUE-and was  intrigued by these evolutionary concepts and what they mean in our everyday  lives.  This is LIFE science indeed!  Thank you.	2000-05-09

Placing its evolution  in a historical context, the author describes the need for encryption and  how more and more secure systems became necessary as each one was cracked.   He takes us to the present day with our need to protect financial and other  sensitive information on Internet.  Considering the technical nature of his  topic, Singh makes cryptography interesting and challenging.  I usually  read several books at a time, but this one held me to the exclusion of  others until I finished it.  Extremely lucid and fascinating.	2000-05-09

But this is no easy \\"feel good\\" book with affirmations empty of  action.  His 10 Laws of Life remind us that having a good life (and a happy  one) means taking responsibility for every aspect of it-including our  attitude about our experiences and the wrongs done to us by others.  Until  we take control of our lives instead of talking about \\"someday,\\" we stay  stuck in our problems.  I did not take issue with any of Dr. McGraw's  \\"laws,\\" nor with any of his examples.  Well done.  I'd like to see this  book assigned in schools to fifteen-year-olds.  His chapter, \\"A guided tour  of your life,\\" really gets down to the specifics people can use to get  their lives on track.	2000-05-09

A review from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: TRANSFORMING DREAM MESSAGES INTO LIFE ACTION: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND  FANTASIES.<br />Kingsolver is a master storyteller.  Throw in her politics,  passions, and ability to describe environmental concerns without getting  preachy, and you can learn something from her books.  Add her lyrical prose  and you have a winner.  I love her work and was glad to see that in ANIMAL  DREAMS, she departed only very briefly from the point of view of her  protagonist.  I love how this story unfolded, the development and changes  of the viewpoint character, and the very positive view she gives us of  relationships between men and women who love each other.  A delightful book  on all counts!	2000-05-09

Because so many people who know me well recommended this book, I decided to  give it a shot.  Once I started it, I didn't want to stop reading.  The  voices of these characters, their individual development, and the human  tragedies brought about by human arrogance haunt me.  I find myself  thinking about this book and its structure repeatedly.  Since my first  reading, I've read through all of Kingsolver's other books and this one is  her masterpiece (so far).  Encompassing environmental and social issues as  well as the lives of her individual characters, this book forces us to  confront our own defects of character and the consequences blind choices.   Having read this book once for story, I plan to read it again for craft.   One of the few novels I would call \\"a must read.\\"  Multi-layered and  challenging.	2000-04-27

In modern, Western, secular culture, many of  us have forgotten the value of marking life passages in ways that speak to  our individual needs.  Well-organized and well-written, with helpful  questions to guide us through planning a ritual and whom to include,  RITUALS FOR OUR TIMES brings us back to the power and pleasure of even  everyday rituals.  Through their suggestions, we learn how we can plan  rituals with forethought and conscious choice and without rigidity to old  ways that no longer work.  With touching stories, authors Imber-Black and  Roberts demonstrate the potency of ritual to facilitate growth and resolve  conflicts--old and new.	2000-03-26

Reading it with a world map  next to me, I enjoyed the discovery of continents and islands that I wished  to could see first hand.

I had hesitated to read it  because it was \\"a recovery book\\" and I expected that designation to limit  its benefits.  What I found, however, were stories that confirmed that to  grow we must be willing to fail and make mistakes.  This is what it means  to be human.  With this book's encouragement, hope, and humor, I embarked  on my speaking and writing career, willing to blunder and to learn from  others.  Since then, I have recommended and bought this book as a gift many  times.  I list this title in my handouts for nearly all of my self-help  classes and in the bibliographies of the books I write.	2000-03-01

Like one of the reviewers below, I was charmed by so many sections  that much of my hardcover copy is now highlighted in yellow.<br />I especially  liked: &quot;...we often end up trading our authenticity for what we  perceive as survival, terrified to swap security for our heart's deepest  desires, which is the imperative of all callings and none of the dominant  fears in responding to them.&quot; and &quot;The great breakthroughs in our  lives generally happen only as a result of the accumulation of small steps  and minor achievements.&quot; (And these two quotes are in the first five  pages!)

The power imbalance in the  therapeutic encounter makes it imperative that if you are going to see a  psychotherapist, the focus must be on restoring confidence and  self-understanding and not being told by what you should be.  For  professionals, the temptations of such power often leads to unethical  behavior.  Yes, AGAINST THERAPY is an angry book-- and rightfully so.	2000-02-14

Responsible non-monogamay doesn't mean you are unable  to be in a committed relationship or that you are sleeping around,  cheating, or risking STDs. If you have considered polyamory in any form  (and there are many ways to be polyamorous) this book will help you examine  the pitfalls and promises.  The suggestions for honesty, compassionate  understanding, and dealing with jealousy in relationships will be  informative even for those who decide poly isn't for them.

I've read many books on creativity and Eric Maisel describes it as no one else has.  FEARLESS CREATING takes you through the steps of the creative process, predicts the typical anxieties and pitfalls, and offers specific  suggestions to get past them.  I especially liked his explanation for  attending to your rhythms as your work and distinguishing between needed  quiet time and using quiet to avoid the inevitable anxiety of creating.<br />      As an author, I found Maisel's principles and advice to resonate with my  experience.  Working on an outline for my next book as I read, I found the  book inspirational and fun as well as reassuring.  If you liked Julia  Cameron's THE ARTIST'S WAY, you'll love this book as much as I did.<br />I am  recommending it to all my creative friends.	1999-05-01

This is definitely one of my most treasured books and I literally buy *hundreds* of books a year.  A terrific gift guaranteed to provoke thought and  stimulating discussion.  My favorites:<br />&quot;Everything in excess.  To  enjoy the flavor of life, take big bites.  Moderation is for  monks.&quot;<br />&quot;A competent and self-confident person is incapable of  jealousy in anything.  Jealousy is invariably a symptom of neurotic  insecurity.&quot;	1999-02-11
