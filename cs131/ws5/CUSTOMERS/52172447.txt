So in view of the unblemished string of five-star reviews, cut me some slack if I tell you that \\"Falls the Shadow\\" is not up to the Lashner standards we've come to expect.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad novel.  Many of the strengths of earlier Lashner - the gritty Philadelphia neighborhoods, characters with more depth than the average cardboard cutout, storylines running from the unusual to the bizarre - are all here.  Told in the first person, the story unfolds as easily as if Carl were telling it to the reader over a brew at a Philly watering hole.  But this time around, the story feels tired, forced, lacking energy as Victor Carl grinds through familiar haunts feeling like one of \\"The Hollow Men\\" of the TS Elliot-referenced title.<br /><br />We find Carl and partner Beth Derringer taking on the case of Francois Dube, already serving time for the murder of his wife.  Dube, an insufferable French chef, maintains his innocence and, with financial backing from the equally obnoxious gold digger Velma Takahashi, convinces Carl, against all odds, to pursue a retrial.  True to Lashner's offbeat form, a meddling dentist, \\"Bob\\", plays a key role in the mystery of the Dube murder, as well as in a side plot involving a reluctant Carl's role in a pro bono case of child neglect.  Maybe it's the combination of annoying Frenchmen and of uncomfortable time in a dentist's chair. Or maybe it's the absence of the brutal color typically provided by Carl heavy Phil Skink, or the unnecessary tension between Carl and Beth.  Perhaps it's the rather contrived climax, or the confluence of too many players with too many stories trying too hard to deliver too many morals. But whatever the source, when all the drama has finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled,  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark.  A better-than-average legal thriller, for sure, but one that ultimately fails to generate passion, falling short of Lashner's uncommon talents.finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled,  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark.

In his latest effort, the accomplished Ian Rankin takes on a host of contemporary issues: illegal immigration, racism, bureaucratic corruption, the slave trade, and more.  Strangely, despite the title, the prostitution plays only a background role in this complex and intelligent whodunit.  Back is curmudgeon Detective Inspector John Rebus, prowling the pubs of Edinburgh and environs while unraveling the mysteries of the murder of an unidentified immigrant in a run down housing project.  Rebus-partner Siobhan Clarke as a favor is investigating a runaway - the sister of a rape victim whose case Siobhan had previously dispatched.  Meanwhile, the skeletal remains of a woman and child are dug up in the basement of a \\"Fleshmarket Alley\\" watering hole.  Predictably, these seemingly disparate threads intertwine, while Rankin, in no hurry to satisfy the reader's curiosity, tediously layers plot upon subplot until all the dots finally connect.  For a less talented author, the slow pace and convoluted collection of races, places, and faces could prove frustrating, but Rankin's Rebus is a strong enough character to carry the load of an overly burdened plot, and interesting supporting players, richly drawn settings, and witty and gritty Scottish dialogue hasten the pace.  The obvious sexual tension between Rebus and Clarke provides some amusing distraction as Rankin dissects with the subtlety of a chain saw some very serious social issues.  In short, a complicated tale skillfully told, confirming Rankin's entitlement to the awards he's won.  A highly recommended read.	2005-10-09

Part time alcoholic and full time slacker - albeit a lovable slacker - Hank does a neighbor a small favor and as a result finds his previously ordinary life spinning wildly out of control through a .44 Magnum-sized case of mistaken identity.  Hank, whose biggest previous concern was a remedy for sore feet and the fate of his San Francisco Giants, is now the target of a motley crew of Russian gangsters, assorted New York freaks, and dirty cops.<br /><br />Give first-time author Charlie Huston lots of credit: his irreverent, hip, and uncensored delivery assaults the reader relentlessly and without apology.  A poor man's Cormac McCarthy, Huston dispatches the goods with none of the poetry but all of the impact; a visceral personal tour of one man's worst nightmare.  Huston's gradual transformation of Hank from the basically docile ordinary guy to a stone cold killer is jolting, and guaranteed to trash any plans for the weekend you may have had.  And despite his found talent for violence, you'll find yourself still rooting for Hank who, as the mayhem surrounding him mounts, his most pressing issue remains the outcome of baseball's regular season.<br /><br />Brutal, blunt, and gritty, Huston's \\"Caught Stealing\\" satisfies the deepest addictions of the pop thriller junkie.  The first in a trilogy, \\"Stealing\\" was followed by the equally outrageous \\"Six Bad Things\\", and is scheduled to conclude with \\"A Dangerous Man\\" next year.  If you're anything like me, you'll be anxiously waiting for Huston to wrap up Hank's crazed odyssey of blood lust and baseball.	2005-10-06

But with the possible exception of Tim Cocky's undertaker-investigator, John Dunning's sometimes PI Cliff Janeway, who also happens to be a bookseller, is certainly unique.<br /><br />\\"The Sign of the Book\\" is the fourth Janeway novel.  Cliff Janeway, proprietor of a small used book shop in Denver, is called upon by girlfriend/lawyer Erin D'Angelo to help out her childhood friend, Laura Marshall, accused of murder.  To complicate matters, the victim is Laura's husband but also Erin's former lover, before he was stolen away by Laura.  Notwithstanding their personal rift, Laura would like the still-embittered Erin to represent her in the trial, so Cliff is asked to check out the circumstances before Erin decides if she even wants to see Laura again.  Kind of like \\"Desperate Housewives of the Rocky Mountains.\\"  But thanks to Dunning's easy style and compelling dialogue, it works.  While Laura has confessed to the crime, there are some obvious discrepancies between her story and the crime scene.  And an unusual and very valuable collection of signed books in the Marshall home seems incongruous with husband Bobby's lifestyle.<br /><br />It didn't take long to get thoroughly engrossed in this classic whodunit, while at the same time being educated in the rather obscure but interesting rare book trade.  Close inspection of the plot may raise some eyebrows, but that is a very minor distraction to a tightly wound mystery with likeable characters balanced with sufficient action and suspense.  All things considered, top-notch entertainment and a highly recommended read.	2005-09-25

An American ex-pat whiling away his days on Mexico's Yucatan coast - sun, surf, a beach bungalow, passive owner of an open-air beach bar dive.  But as the story unfolds, we learn he is also a man with a history.  A dangerous man living off a pile - a big pile - of cash that its rightful thieves want back.  When a Russian backpacker unwittingly blows Hank's Mexican cover, he heads back across the border to protect his family and resume his briefly interrupted trail of mayhem.<br /><br />With this backdrop, author Charlie Huston takes us on an extraordinary odyssey of evasion and murder unparalleled in pop fiction.  Huston's lean and uneven, slightly nonlinear style is surprisingly effective.  With shades of Boston Teran's sinister \\"God is a Bullet\\", or of Cormac McCarthy were he a Californian beach dude writing on while on Quaaludes, this is simply not your average thriller.  Drugs, hookers, psychotic surfers, Las Vegas at its seamiest, the flat out depths of despair in society - this is \\"Six Bad Things\\".  Addictive, engaging, powerful fiction.  But like I said, it's not for everyone.  For the rest, there's always \\"The Ya Ya Sisterhood\\".	2005-09-20

The carpet bagging Carmichael (Pennsylvania in this case, not New York) has weaseled her way into the Senate on the coattails of her powerful husband, and now will stop at nothing to reach the White House.<br /><br />But old Hillary - I mean Helen - is only a sideshow in this rollicking and ambitious tale of radical Islam and terrorism.  Give Brad Thor credit for originality: few would consider Hannibal's second century BC trans-Alps raid of Rome as the hook for an Islamic plot to finally rid the world - starting with the US of course - of all of us pesky non-believing infidels.  While Thor takes some liberty with the ancients' understanding of contagious diseases, this is a unique and refreshing take on the standard spy-vs-spy thriller, complete with a handy primer on Sunni, Shi'a, and Wahhabi beliefs, as well as some interesting history of Hannibal and his trek across the Alps.<br /><br />Having said that, this novel is not without its flaws.  Seems all the brainy babes have PhD's, and could easily be appearing straight from the pages of Playboy's \\"The Women of Blowback\\" pictorial.  And I found our hero, Scot Horvath, a bit annoying,  the stereotyped ultra-macho ex-SEAL who nonetheless seems to get the stuffing kicked out of him consistently for the first two hundred pages or so. Overdosed with testosterone and under dosed with intelligent dialogue, Horvath just never clicked with me.  And even at a generous 433 pages, Thor simply had too much going on to do anything more sophisticated than to wrap up the numerous story lines in a perfunctory, yadda-yadda-yadda-type climax.  But I quibble.  \\"Blowback\\" is a fun read, escapist entertainment that purveys just enough credibility to eliminate the \\"guilty\\" from pleasure.	2005-09-17

It is not character development; we don't even know the name of \\"Blood Meridian's\\" main character, known only as \\"the kid\\".  And it is certainly not the plot, as \\"Blood\\" rampages aimlessly though a few decades of the kid's life, most in the few years he rode the Texas-Mexico border with \\"Captain\\" John Joel Glanton's band of scalp hunters as they terrorized both sides of the border around 1850.  But McCarthy's prose - veering without warning from succinct couplets worth a thousand pictures to rambling 200 word sentences that fill an entire paragraph - is simply unparalleled.  More epic poetry than a novel, McCormac's writing is a blunt instrument delivering blows with precision, stark exposition without apology or analysis, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks and absorb the shock unprotected but also unencumbered.  And you may want to keep a dictionary handy - unabridged - as McCarthy's verbiage will challenge even the most accomplished linguist.<br /><br />If you harbor any delusions of a \\"romantic\\" western expansion of the US, you may want to think twice before allowing \\"Blood Meridian\\" to shatter these illusions.  McCarthy's west has absolutely no similarity to Bonanza, Clint Eastwood, Dee Brown or Larry McCurtry.  Talk about an apocalyptic image of the old west - picture Glanton's band of misfits riding into a frontier town, covered in weeks of prairie dust and blood decorated both horse and rider in human skins and various severed body parts.  Don't expect political correctness in McCarthy's work: depravity and blood lust was a sport enjoyed by both the American aboriginal tribes and those that pursue them, as McCarthy without emotion unveils unspeakable acts of barbarism and torture on both sides.  Critically acclaimed as a expose that plumbs the depths of the darkness of mans' soul, McCarthy burns phantom images in the brain that while perhaps not immediately absorbed will return to haunt the reader long after the pages have turned.  In short, a true American classic, a powerful if perverse window into a little-told period of American history, told through allegory and poetry evoking emotions not easily shaken.he reader long after the pages have turned.

But it may also be a frustrating read, requiring the reader's careful concentration and a tolerance for some ambiguity.  Like Hitchcock's famous \\"Psycho\\" shower scene, Harwood allows the reader to conjure up images and events beyond those otherwise conveyed in words or on the screen.<br /><br />The main character, Gerard Freeman, is the child of an overprotective British mother on an apparently self-imposed exile to Australia.  Young Gerard, while snooping through his mother's bedroom, stumbles upon some clues of her history in England.  Included in these hidden memoirs is an eerie short story penned by Gerard's great-grandmother, as well as an old photo of a beautiful but unidentified young woman.  Mom catches him in the act, and her reaction is severe and seemingly disproportionate to the offense, leaving Gerard not only more curious, but obsessed with unlocking the mystery of his early English childhood and his mother's murky past.<br /><br />Months pass, and despite mother's efforts to prevent it, Gerard takes up a correspondence with a \\"pen friend\\", Alice, a young English girl who has a sketchy past of her own.  The relationship with Alice soon becomes its own obsession that, coupled with Mom's imposed virtual imprisonment, results in Gerard's maturing to an introverted young man lacking both friends and confidence.  As the bizarre connection between Gerard and \\"invisible lover\\" Alice becomes more intimate, he plans a trip to England with the dual goals of finding both Alice and his childhood English manor home.  Through the discovery of more of great-grandmother's spooky stories, Harwood weaves convoluted but addictive parallel plots of past and present, of great-grandma's fictional ghost stories and all too real events in Gerard's life.  By now thoroughly hooked, the reader is challenged with sorting out these supposedly fictional characters and subplots that cleverly blur with Gerard's own family's troubled history.  Complete with proverbial skeletons in the closet and genuinely scary situations, \\"Ghost Writer\\" careens to a climax that can only be described as ambiguous.  While admittedly perplexing at times, there is also method in Harwood's craft; his ending, as elusive as the spirits of which he writes, leaves the reader pondering this novel long after the last page is turned. In short, a unique rendering of the classic English ghost story, well worth the time and required effort.now thoroughly hooked, the reader is challenged with sorting out these supposedly fictional characters and subplots that cleverly blur with Gerard's own family's troubled history.

Blunt's writing style is similar to Lee Child - high praise - while the content is reminiscent of Ken Goddard, who has written some fine crime novels (\\"Balefire\\", \\"Prey\\"...) featuring the US Fish and Wildlife Department.  Giles and researched his subject material well, and throws in some neat forensics to boot, making for the classic summer read that will keep you up long after you should be sleeping.<br /><br />A young girl his wandering around the local Algonquin Bay watering hole, incoherent and obviously suffering from amnesia.  With good reason, it turns out - she has a bullet lodged in her brain.  Homicide detective John Cardinal and his partner Lise Delorme are on the case, trying first to identify the redheaded young victim and then try and find those behind the attempted murder.  From there, Blunt takes us on a guided tour of the north woods heroin trade, complete with renegade bikers and a mysterious and evil Voodoo-like religion.  Blunt keep the story line clean and the dialog mercifully crisp, focusing his efforts on unraveling the crime while building a uniquely depraved bad guy.  The thriller clips along to a suspenseful if predictable climax and high adrenaline entertainment for the whole trip.  This is highly recommended reading; I'm looking forward to catching up on Blunt's previous efforts that I've missed.	2005-09-10

Fulfilling the dying man's request, Broadbent launches into an unlikely quest to identify the murdered man and deliver his notebook to his daughter, who Broadbent knows only as \\"Robbie.\\"  Soon Broadbent finds himself in the middle of a convoluted plot involving an eclectic mix of evil museum curators and shadowy government SpecOps, of ex-cons, Santa Fe cops, and an ex-CIA agent trying to leave his old life behind and become a monk.<br /><br />Preston keeps the pace quick, moving the reader through staccato chapters closing with one cliffhanger after another, making sure to keep the pages turning.  Compared to the sub par \\"Codex\\", I found \\"Tyrannosaur\\" closer to more traditional Preston/Child fare: a few grains of science to add some credibility to a well-told story unencumbered by in-depth character development, lyrical prose, or deep drama.  If you're able to suspend all belief, you'll likely enjoy this classic pop fiction in which the good guys emerge from crisis upon crisis with mere flesh wounds while the bad guys in the end come up short.

She is also manic-depressive, suicidal, alcoholic, and pregnant.  At least give author Greg Iles credit for developing an unusually unique heroine.  Buy we soon learn that there is a reason for the psychological baggage Cat carries as Iles pulls us into the shadowy science of repressed memory and loathsome crimes of child molestation.  Not the stuff of an easy beach read, for sure.<br /><br />After blacking out at the crime seen of an especially brutal murder, Cat returns to her childhood home in Natchez, Mississippi for some R&R.  Cat had no normal childhood: her family was of the American South aristocracy, a plantation-like home complete with slave quarters and servants, led by her patriarchal grandfather. We learn that Cat's father was murdered when Cat was a child, though her recollections of that night are sketchy at best.  From this gothic setting, the author takes us through a rambling and overly long journey through memory and mayhem as this \\"he did it, no-I did it, wait-you did it\\" drama unfolds.<br /><br />Iles, while no James Lee Burke, does a more than credible job of capturing the rare beauty and uncommon contradictions of the lower Mississippi River environs.  In the final analysis, this is powerful fiction, but not without it's flaws.  Its nearly 500 pages of fine print would have benefited from a more ruthless editor's cut of another hundred pages or so.  And the fragile Cat, despite frequent reminders of how strong she truly is, never captured my interest as a compelling main character.  But if you're looking for a sprawling southern epic that is not afraid to take sensitive topics head-on, I'd give \\"Blood Memory\\" a try.	2005-08-27

Here, Daniel Silva takes the issue head on, spinning a fictional yet wholly believable indictment of the Church's complicity with the Nazis, if not as a direct participant, at least in looking the other way while atrocities were committed across Eastern Europe.<br /><br />Back is Gabriel Allon, the sometime art restorer and full time assassin of the Israeli Mossad.  Allon's current assignment - restoration of the Bellini altarpiece at Venice's San Zaccaria Cathedral - is interrupted to investigate and avenge the murder of longtime friend and Mossad colleague Benjamin Stern.  Stern, it turns out, was deep into research that uncovers incriminating evidence of Vatican activity during the Holocaust and in aiding the escape to South America of Nazi war criminals.  As always, Silva's Allon is a compelling lead character, while the relevant history is well researched and credible.  The plot is thick with conspiracy and secret organizations, similar in that regard to \\"DaVinci Code\\".  And like \\"DaVinci\\", the premise is not complementary of the Roman Catholic Church.  Silva's tale unapologetically builds a case that condemns Pope Pius XII for Nazi sympathies during the war, while criticizing his successors for refusing repeated requests to unlock secret Vatican documents regarding the Church's dealings during WWII.  While the thinly velied implications of subject matter may offend some, most should find \\"The Confessor\\" a suspenseful and entertaining illumination of a not particularly proud period of western civilization.	2005-08-20

A young woman, Ida Durbin, rescues the boys, and soon Jimmy is head-over-heels in love.  That the mysterious Ida turns out to be a hooker does not deter Jimmy's passions, and he continues to pursue an ill-fated affair ending with her unexplained disappearance.<br /><br />It is forty years later, and an aging and retired Robicheaux is pining the passing of third-wife Bootsie. Ida's name is dredged from the past on the deathbed confession of a local thug. Improbably, solving Ida's disappearance of nearly a half-century before serves as the plot for this mostly rambling and disconnected mystery.  Those familiar with Burke will find the backdrop familiar - a wealthy and aristocratic Louisiana family with a history of exploiting the noble poor and black of the bayou - is the likely wrong-doer.  As Robicheaux tracks down forty-year old leads on Ida, a brutal serial killer is also on the loose, while at the same time Robicheaux is falling in love with a nun.  Longtime Robicheaux sidekick Clete Purcel plays a role, but the \\"master of mayhem's\\" antics are regrettably relegated to the background while a brooding and embittered Robicheaux plods through his investigations uninspired.<br /><br />Even Burke's justifiably vaunted prose feels tired in this one - perhaps there are only so many metaphors to describe gun-cotton skies and the smell of fish spawning.  But while even the worst of Burke's writing is far better than the average contemporary crime fiction, the forced and disjointed \\"Crusader's Cross\\" leaves me yearning for more Burke masterpieces like \\"Sunset Limited\\", \\"Purple Cane Road\\",  \\"Black Cherry Blues\\", and more recently, \\"Last Car to Elysian Fields\\".Fields\\".	2005-08-13

Narrowly escaping the owners returning to the scene to reclaim their \\"product\\" and cash, this is ostensibly the story of Moss' life on the run as he flees with the booty.  But any similarity to this and standard pop thriller fare ends with this loose plot: McCarthy builds a brutal an unforgiving story with equal doses of social commentary, homespun southwestern wisdom, frustration, and despair.  This is forceful literature wrapped in western shell.<br /><br />McCarthy's staccato dialogue in Texan slang is as bleak and unadorned as the southwest Texas borderland of which he writes.  Few fictional bad guys can rival McCarthy's Anton Chigurh, the psychopathic hired assassin who leaves an untold number of dead in his wake dispatched through his own twisted brand of justice.  On the other side of the ledger, aging county Sheriff Ed Tom Bell muses philosophically on his inadequacies in combating a drug trade that has spiraled far out of control, and an increasing permissive culture spinning more rapidly into decline.  McCarthy lures us into the trap of believing this is another tired tale of revenge and redemption, and then hits the unsuspecting reader with twists as subtle as a head shot from Chigurh's ubiquitous cattle prod.  The colloquial dialogue and somewhat non-linearity of the story requires some concentration, but therein lies much of this story's power and appeal.  \\"No Country for Old Men\\" is not a \\"pretty\\" novel: McCarthy is not here to inspire or send a message of hope, justice, or fairness.  He simply tells it like it is.	2005-08-04

While Connolly's rich and lyrical prose always carries an element of the supernatural, \\"Angel\\" treads without apology into a heavily theological and mystical territory featuring allegorical fallen angels and the cult that worships them.  A young prostitute has disappeared in New York, and Parker is called upon by the mother to try to find her.  It turns out that the prostitute is also the niece of Parker's sometime partner Louis deepening, if possible, Louis' usual brand of malevolence.  The trail leads Parker and team into a richly convoluted maze constructed of 15th century monasteries, secret crypts and creepy ossuaries, cadaverous art dealers, and the \\"apocrypha\\", ancient canonical text considered too controversial to be included in the standard books of the Bible.  While unraveling the dual mysteries of Louis' niece and the legendary fallen \\"Black Angel\\", Parker confronts perhaps his most formable adversary yet, the mysterious and repugnant Brightwell, a corpulent villain as ageless as he is obese.<br /><br />If you've never read John Connolly, \\"The Black Angel\\" would not be a great place to start.  Neither Parker nor the Louis/Angel team of hired mayhem are in the best spirits, each haunted by their own guilts and ghosts of the past.  Notwithstanding, Connolly delivers another unconventional and offbeat PI thriller, at the same time brutal and beautifully written.  A must read for the Connolly fan, while the uninitiated would be better off starting with \\"Every Dead Thing\\".	2005-07-31

But there are some inconsistencies in the all-too-perfect conclusion, inconsistencies that pull the now sixty-something Scudder into the hunt.  It seems that a third player is pulling the strings, and as new bodies start to pile up, the NYPD starts taking Scudder's doubts seriously.<br /><br />As always, Block writes with the street start style that only a New Yorker who knows and loves his city can muster.  Through the eyes of Scudder, Bloch perfectly captures New York from the mean streets of Hell's Kitchen to the posh digs bordering Central Park.  Those familiar with Block will welcome brief but meaningful appearances of Danny Boy and Mick Ballou, while TJ has matured from the street kid cast adrift to a savvy and well-grounded adolescent, the full-fledged assistant to the mostly-retired Scudder.  Cleverly plotted, suspenseful, and well paced, \\"Hope to Die\\" piles up more evidence in the case to declare Lawrence Block as America's most accomplished author of popular crime fiction.  If you enjoy this one, make sure to read \\"All the Flowers are Dying\\", a poignant follow-up to this fine mystery/thriller.	2005-07-31

I guess I'm in the minority on this given the rave reviews, but I found this Eisler's weakest effort:  rambling, disjointed, less focused, and as a consequence, less entertaining than the previous three.  In this episode, Rain botches a Mossad-contracted job in Manila, becoming prey to his erstwhile employers.  While typically working alone, this time around Rain is teamed with \\"Dox\\", a former Marine sniper overdosed with cornpone and good-ole-boy charm.  And therein lies the problem.  Eisler's does Rain best as the stoic loner, the elusive assassin whose life depends on paranoia and a wraith-like existence.  But \\"Killing Rain\\" meanders into unfamiliar territory for Rain and apparently for Eisler - the relationship between Rain and Dox feels too much like a bad remake of \\"Lethal Weapon's\\" Glover/Gibson bantering.  To make matters worse, Rain's love affair with Mossad operative Delilah careens from being merely awkward to definitely sappy, while at all times unnatural.  Notwithstanding, there are some genuinely suspenseful action scenes, but unfortunately these are only bookends too many pages of Rain's introspection, self-doubt, and reflection.  The reader can take an assassin with some principals, but a cold-blooded killer getting in touch with his feelings?  Better left to Dr. Phil.  Barry Eisler is a talented author and the \\"Rain\\" series has been a unique and refreshing twist on familiar fare - hopefully he'll get it back on track with his next installment.	2005-07-10

Today's new class of the hardboiled gumshoe novel - Dennis Lehane, Robert Crais, even Lee Child - certainly must owe some allegiance to Block. \\"All the Flowers are Dying\\" is a poignant example of the master at the top of his craft - a powerful entry in the Matt Scudder series in which both the author and the characters face the inevitable sunset of their years.  Scudder, now in his mid-sixties, a mostly-retired warhorse still haunts the Irish taverns and church basement AA meetings in New York's old Hell's Kitchen neighborhood familiar from previous works.  Scudder reluctantly takes on the investigation of an elusive boyfriend as a favor to a friend, but soon finds himself drawn into the trap of a heinously clever serial killer.  Make no mistake - \\"Flowers\\" is as brutal as it is melancholy, flush with gut wrenching scenes of child rape, torture, murder, and other depravity.  But if you were looking for fairy tales, you wouldn't be reading Lawrence Block.  There are a few twists along the way, and Block's patented grit, grime, and urban beauty of New York, building to a classic if predictable climax.  The Scudder fan will appreciate the patina of Block's prose, mellowed by time, more introspective, even fatalistic.  Even the fearful one-time gangster Mick Ballou has mellowed into a Brando-like Godfather figure, reminiscing about the old days while dispatching homespun wisdom.  In summary, a masterful blend of savagery and passion, of black humor and reflection - compelling fiction that you'll not soon forget.	2005-07-04

A few seconds of seemingly random violence from a sniper's rifle puts an unnamed Midwestern city in panic.  But impeccable police work has the perp in irons within the day, as the forensics lead to Army vet (and former Desert Storm sniper) James Barr.  Barr's one request: find Jack Reacher - he'll prove my innocence despite what appears to be a slam-dunk case for the prosecution.  The story unfolds, unveiling a prior history between Barr and Reacher, while the initially straightforward case becomes less certain.  So engrossing is the mystery that the hardcore Reacher fan may overlook the fact that almost 100 pages have turned before Reacher actually hurts anyone.  Momentum builds steadily, taking a few twists while leading to an unforgettable climax guaranteed to knock your socks off.<br /><br />So while there may be nothing extraordinary about the basic plot - it's been done in a million variations - what is extraordinary is the visceral appeal of loner Jack Reacher - the ultimate cross between Clint Eastwood's `man without a name\\" and Sherlock Holmes.  Reacher is justice personified, an irreverent avenging angel who shuns all material possessions in exchange for total independence.  Also extraordinary is Child's ability to tell spin a yarn in clear, concise, stripped down prose that keeps the story clean, the dialogue lean, and the pages turning.  You'll get no ambiguity from Child (or Reacher, for that matter): black and white, good and evil, and when there is evil, dispatch it quickly and brutally.<br /><br />In short, \\"One Shot\\" is about as good as action fiction gets.  The only drawback is that Child only writes one novel a year - it's a long wait till the next rush.	2005-07-04

Picking up a couple of months after last year's \\"Brimstone\\" left off, this latest yarn brings back virtually the entire cast of Preston/Child novels: Bill Smithback, Nora Kelley, Margot Green, Vincent D'Agosta, Laura Hayward, and the mysterious \\"Constance\\" from \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\".  A true Preston/Child family reunion - but with reason: the diabolical Dionysus is intent on systematically picking off all of those who have been close to Pentergast.  \\"Dance\\" appears to be the middle installment of a trilogy, and therein lays some of the weakness; neither a definitive beginning nor end.  Pentergast, a bizarre cross between James Bond and Hannibal Lecter, is certainly one of popular fiction's most engaging characters.  But this time around, the authors have pushed the envelope a bit too far, resulting in a Pentergast more freakish than fascinating.  But I quibble: despite some weaknesses, \\"Dance of Death\\" makes the grade, packing enough fun and sufficient twists between its 451 pages to keep the reader fully engaged.  I look forward to next year's concluding (?) segment.	2005-07-02

As expected from Hiaasen, the heroes are as wacky as the villains, though less despicable and in possession of a moral compass.  This time around it is Twilly Spree, a twenty-something slacker living off an inheritance, on probation for blowing up his uncle's bank.  But to qualify as a \\"good guy\\" in a Hiaasen novel, you must be a staunch defender of Florida's wild beauty and oppose, with force if necessary, all those who would build condos, shopping malls, golf courses, or any other form of civilization that would defile Florida's scrub pines and swamp lands.  Twilly qualifies.  In the other corner, we find Palmer Stoat, a lobbyist of contemptible dimension, a human being so abominably sleazy and without principal that you'll love to hate him.  Team Sloat with a perverted drug dealer-turned-real estate developer, a clueless Toyota-dealing state governor, and Florida's fictional unspoiled \\"Toad Island\\", and you have all the necessary ingredients for another installment of Hiaasen's patented insanity.  But this is black humor with a message: one cannot read Carl Hiaasen and not become frustrated with the greed and corruption so common with politics and politicians at all levels in all places.  While Hiaasen may be formulaic, his stinging satire hits home.  Like the muckrakers of old, Carl Hiaasen is on a mission, and no purveyors of avarice, fraud, or pretension are left unscathed by his blistering prose.  If you're a fan of Hiaasen, \\"Sick Puppy\\" is another fine installment with some familiar characters and well-worn themes.  Social satire at its finest.	2005-06-19

Casey, an urban dwelling journalist, wheedles her way onto the Farallones for a night after viewing a BBC documentary of the great white sharks that frequent the islands every fall to feed on the rich seal population.  The self-absorbed Casey is apparently shocked to learn that life on a remote pile of rocks off the wild Pacific coast is somewhat different than life in Manhattan, and is thereby compelled to regale the reader with the horrors of dirty clothes, stale food, clogged toilets, and lumpy mattresses.  Meanwhile, the sheer power and majesty of the resident shark population rise above Casey's yammering on the evils of yuppie life and the purity of the Farallones.  That the size, raw power, and enigma of these great whites instill in us a primitive terror is not a surprise.  But these sharks also implant a less obvious response to make sure they are protected rather than pursued.<br /><br />But most incredulous is Casey's total oblivion to irony: her unwelcome intrusion leads to termination of the shark project she went to chronicle, while the release of  \\"The Devil's Teeth\\" has inevitably drawn more attention to the islands and their sharks - exactly the kind of attention Casey supposedly abhors.  In the end, score five for the sharks, one for Casey: a three-star read that should have been much better.	2005-06-15

Eisler's writing is deeper and more plausible than Ludlum, more complex than Lee Child, more entertaining than LeCarre.  But one brief word of warning: unless your daily lexicon is comfortable with \\"elegiac\\", \\"inchoate\\", \\"encomia\\", \\"quotidian\\", and the like, be prepared to give your `Webster's' a good workout.<br /><br />In \\"Hard Rain\\", the elusive John Rain is drawn into one last job, a favor for sometimes nemesis Tatsu of Japan's equivalent of the FBI.  Rain stalks a sadistic Japanese assassin who is only slightly less circumspect but just as lethal than the wily Rain through the neighborhoods, nightclubs, health clubs, and back alleys of a Tokyo that is as convincing and authentic as any I've read.  The plot will ring true for anyone with a basic appreciation of the corrupt Japanese bureaucracy and the US economy's dependency on Japan's economic strength.  So also does Eisler succeed in capturing the impossibly clandestine life of the much fabled assassin-for-hire, describing the painstaking detail the steps Rain considers routine in maintaining a life that requires a near-phantom existence.<br /><br />In summary, \\"Hard Rain\\" is an intelligent, fast-paced yarn with an interesting set of characters, vivid settings, and a clever, well-conceived plot.  Barry Eisler is the real deal - well worth the time.	2005-06-12

Wallace writes of this period like French artist Jacques David painted it: romantic, over-inflated, pompous, and idealistic.  The novel starts out with a bang - an encounter with a pack of starving wolves while crossing the northern Russian plain in an open sled is harrowing and suspenseful.  But from there, Wallace lurches into an 18th Century soap opera of scheming countesses and debauchery while building a ludicrously unlikely plot.  Wallace, a talented writer of feature films whose big scene epics I've enjoyed, unfortunately writes novels like a movie script.  Conversation between Selkirk and Gorlav, his Russian sidekick, feels more like \\"Lethal Weapon's\\" Gibson and Glover a pair of supposedly hardened mercenary cavalrymen.  With more platitude than provocation and its few thrills overpowered by mind-numbing tedium, Wallace is better watched than read.  Wait for the movie.	2005-06-04

Alten is nothing if not ambitious: not content to spin a simple Jaws-like tale of mutant beasts and mayhem, Alten loops the mystery back to the days William Wallace and Robert the Bruce (Braveheart), of Knights Templar, The Crusades, and Freemasons!  Meanwhile, Zach's estranged father, a womanizing curmudgeon who has no contact with Zach for seventeen years, is on trial for murder.  His defense?  \\"Nessie\\" did it.  So it's up to young Zach to prove the existence of Nessie and rescue dad from the gallows.<br /><br />Convoluted?  You bet, but it works.  In the mechanics of setting up the various layers of plot and subplots, I couldn't help recalling Jeff Goldblum in \\"Jurassic Park\\":  \\"We are supposed to see some dinosaurs, weren't we?\\"  But once the action starts, it doesn't let up, and what Alten lacks in character development and dialogue he well compensates with genuine suspense and an intelligent - if peculiar - thesis.  Alten has done his homework, with enough fact and research to lend plausibility, complemented by enough action and gore to keep the pages turning well into the night.  Top-notch entertainment!	2005-05-30

No heavy psychodrama, moral overtones, or political axes to grind.  Finder is a storyteller, pure and simple, and he delivers his craft in a staccato of rapid-fire chapters that kept me reading well past bedtime.  \\"Company Man\\" is the story of Nick Conover, the beleaguered CEO of The Stratton Corporation, a rust belt office furniture manufacturer trying to survive a tidal wave of cheap labor outsourced to China.  Fenwick is a one company town, and when Conover is forced to layoff half the company, escalating threats from apparent former employees force the single dad Conover to take protecting his family into his own hands.  What follows is a multifaceted thriller as the reader begins to wonder just how many more crises will our hero Nick be forced to endure as his once stable life spins out of control, finding that those he's trusted may not be what they seem.  A bit of Grisham's \\"The Firm\\", some of Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", and first time author James Siegel's \\"Derailed\\" all come to mind while blazing through the pages of this compelling yarn.  Like \\"Paranoia\\" before it, \\"Company Man\\" is top-notch popular fiction, and Joseph Finder is a rising talent well worth checking out.	2005-05-23

Written more than a decade before Dan Brown's blockbuster \\"DaVinci Code\\", Katherine Neville's \\"The Eight\\" may easily have provided Brown inspiration.  \\"The Eight\\" is told in parallel stories, one involving Catherine `Cat' Velis, a 20th century, twenty-something New York City computer whiz; the other Mireille de Remy, a young novice of an 18th century French abbey.  Both are trying to unlock the mystery of the apocryphal \\"Montglane Service\\", a chess set with mystical powers reportedly once given to the great Franco ruler Charlemagne.  Ambitious fare, for sure, and Neville spares no words and leaves no stones unturned in this sprawling epic crossing three continents and two centuries.  While careening through 600 pages of paperback fine print, Neville tells an uneven and disjointed tale, gripping and intriguing in parts, tedious and melodramatic in others.  Neville's account of the French Revolution is for the most part descriptive and insightful, including a clever \\"Tale of Two Cities\\"-like twist on Charlotte Corday's murder of French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. Rich in historical detail, Neville features cameo appearances of Russia's Catherine the Great, Napoleon, artist Jacques-Louis David, Maurice Tallyrand, and even Voltaire.  But in other instances, historical references are left dangling, or are simply inaccurate. At times the action is compelling - Cat's nearly fatal journey through the Sahara is truly terrifying - while others, like the Mediterranean crossing in a storm, are uninspired and insipid by comparison.  There is also a hint of  \\"Harlequin Romance\\", as Neville prefers \\"lean, athletic bodies naked to the waist\\" as temptations for her chaste heroines.  And lets not forget \\"Carioca\\", a yapping mutt only slightly less annoying than Lily, her chess playing master, who inexplicably is compelled to drag this fur ball half way across the world.<br /><br />In summary, while an interesting read at times, it is not one that held my attention rigidly, nor is it worth the concentration demanded to follow the rules of \\"The Game\\".  Careful editing would have removed a couple of hundred pages from this bombast, eliminating loose ends and extraneous references to Freemasons, Rosicrucians, and Fibinacci's numbers.  Give Neville high marks for a clever idea and broad scope.  But poor execution and a needlessly convoluted labyrinth of plot upon subplot may leave the reader exhausted and more interested in simply finishing this marathon than actually caring much about the ultimately silly riddle of the Montglane Service.

James Swain's \\"Mr. Lucky\\" is a cleverly written, highly entertaining mystery that grabs attention from the first page and doesn't let go.  Ricky Smith is the perpetual loser who uncannily strikes it rich, not just once but repeatedly, cleaning up in Vegas at Black Jack, craps, roulette, and even poker, taking a Vegas casino for a cool one-million in a single crazy night.  But Smith's luck doesn't stop, as he picks a $50-grand scratch-off sweapstakes ticket and wins the annual charity raffle in hometown Slippery Rock, North Carolina.  Suspecting they've been swindled, the casino hires Tony Valentine, former Atlantic City casino cop and expert in gambling scams and cons.  Swain, who in real life is in fact an authority in the ways casinos can be swindled, spins a fascinating story that is as revealing as it is fun.  Swain's prose is refreshing free of self-importance, breezing through the pages with an unencumbered confidence and dark humor that is easy to take.  Put your feet up, sit back and enjoy Swain's guided tour through Vegas casinos and Mississippi river boat gambling barges, of hookers and Carolina hillbillies and redneck thugs, while the cagey Tony Valentine unravels \\"Mr. Lucky's\\" sudden streak of good fortune.

US	52172447	R26KXIWHMV343H	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	2	3	5	N	Y	Broken	\\"The Broker\\" is an unusual novel for John Grisham. It lacks the page-turning adrenaline of early thrillers that made his name (\\"The Firm\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", and \\"A Time to Kill\\"), but also is void of the depth and intricacy of some of his more recent work, like \\"The Last Juror.\\" \\"The Broker\\" is, at best, mediocre spy fiction - kind of a cross between OJ Simpson's low-speed chase through LA and a travelogue for Bologna, Italy. The story of Washington, DC, power broker Joel Backman, the beneficiary of a Presidential pardon, is thin, but enough to hold interest for a while on the strength of Grisham's prose and storytelling skill. It felt for a while like Grisham was taking the first two hundred and fifty pages to set up an explosive and memorable climax, but regrettably, any strength in this story is found in the first half, as the end spins into a meaningless and ambiguous close. It feels as if Grisham was onto what could have been an interesting story, lost interest along the way, and just couldn't figure out how to wrap it up. Too bad - the vintage Grisham is one of my favorite writers of popular fiction - but \\"The Broker\\" is as pedestrian as a walk through Bologna's portico-covered sidewalks.	2005-05-04

Ridley Pearson is accomplished in the craft of pop fiction, and true to form he keeps the action moving unencumbered by any in-depth character development or complicated plotting.  \\"Cut and Run\\" does offer some insight into the Federal Witness Protection program, as we find deputy federal marshal Roland \\"Lars\\" Larson falling in love with a protected witness, Hope Stevens.  But that was six years in the past, and the program is so successful in hiding its participants that even Larson is unable to track down his lost love.  When the massive data base tying protected witnesses with their true identity falls into the wrong hands, all hell breaks loose as Lars rushes to catch the bad guys, while at the same time finding and save poor Hope.  Much what follows is formulaic: sadistic criminals, kidnappings, nail-biting cliffhangers, heavy weapons, murder and mayhem enough to fill a couple of hours on the big screen.  Pearson fans will no doubt adore this latest installment; others will find \\"Cut and Run\\" more than sufficient fill for the long plane ride or lazy afternoon on the beach.	2005-05-03

Alan Furst, the accomplished author of WWII espionage thrillers, describes Jon Fasman's first novel as \\"a real reader's book.\\"  It is definitely that.  While lacking the adrenalin-charged pace of DaVinci Code, \\"Geographer\\" is a cleverly conceived, intelligent novel illuminating the ancient and shadowy art of alchemy.  Paul Tomm, a young journalist for a rural Connecticut weekly paper, sets out on a supposedly simple assignment to write the obituary of town resident and college professor Jann Puhapaev.  Puhapaev's death - and life, as it turns out - are shrouded in mystery, and Tomm is drawn into a deliciously convoluted plot spanning a millennium and four continents.  A number of priceless artifacts, stolen from the alchemist of the 11th century's King of Sicily, begin showing up in unlikely places.  With the help of a former professor and his policeman brother, Tomm begins connecting the dots while attracting some unwanted and malevolent attention.  This is a risky venue, accomplished with aplomb in Dan Brown's \\"DaVinci\\", while more often attempts to capture Brown's formula have bogged down in hip-deep minutia and laughingly improbable plots.  While Fasman's effort borders at times on tedium, there is sufficient mystery and intrigue to keep the reader hooked to the climax.  \\"The Geographer's Library\\" could have benefited from a more ruthless editor's cut of another fifty pages or so, but this is nonetheless an impressive debut, well worth the reader's time and attention.	2005-04-24

Fawer's writing is more hip than Creighton, more cerebral than Preston/Childs, and while less even and less polished than either, stands up to both when measured in terms of adrenaline-rich and thought provoking content.<br /><br />\\"Improbable\\" is the story of David Caine who, as a poker playing, epileptic slacker, is hardly the typical pop fiction hero.  But Caine is also a sometimes-professor of probability theory, which frames a refreshing unique tale that spans weighty topics ranging from Einstein's Theory of relativity to the writings of French mathematician LaPlace to the meaning of life itself.  Sound convoluted - you bet - but deliciously so.  By skillfully weaving a plot around it, Fawer pulls off the ultimate improbability - making quantum mechanics not only understandable, but also entertaining.  To this, add the beautiful but lethal double agent, the Russian mob, the North Korean secret service, evil scientists, the CIA, NSA, a bunch of other alphabets, and some good-ole Texas Hold-em for good measure and, well, you get the picture.<br /><br />All things considered, while clearly \\"improbable\\", this is top-notch fiction that is both informative and entertaining.  A terrific first time effort for Fawer - hopefully he'll keep them coming.	2005-04-23

It is truly a remarkable story, totally immersing the reader in a number of extraordinary topics, including the cloistered and eccentric lives of deep-wreck divers and the horrors of submarine warfare in World War II.  The mystery of why an undiscovered and unrecorded wreck of a Nazi sub lying 60 miles off the coast of New Jersey is more than enough substance for a good read. But Kurson embellishes this fascinating tale with a well-metered dose of human interest and intrigue appropriate for what is literally a life-and-death struggle to unlock the secret of this grave 200 feet below the surface of the Atlantic.  What truly sets Kurson's craft above the pack is in the respect and pathos with which he - and the divers - treat the fallen crewmembers.  Going simply beyond finding and identifying the wreck, Kurson chronicles the painstaking efforts divers Chatterton and Kohler take to identify the ill-fated crewmembers, and to set the historical record straight with both Navies and, more importantly, with the surviving families of the German sailors.  This is a tale that deserves to be told, and Kurson tells it with gusto and empathy.  Informative and entertaining, educational and intriguing, this is one book you don't want to miss.	2005-04-14

In Vienna, a mysterious blast, attributed by Austrian officials to Islamic terrorists, destroys the Wartime Claims and Inquiries office, killing at least two of the three inhabitants.  Called back from Venice to investigate is Silva-regular Gabriel Allon, Israeli secret agent and assassin and sometimes-famed restorer of priceless Renaissance paintings.  An unlikely combination perhaps, but few fictional characters can match the depth and power of Silva's Allon.  The author spins a masterful web of time and place, of horrific scenes inside Nazi death camps, the monsters who ran them, to those who survived that Hell only to suffer the guilt of one less obvious but nonetheless tortuous.  The face of true evil is seen in Erich Radek, once an SS officer responsible for the death and disintegration of hundreds of thousands of European Jews, currently enjoying life as a prosperous businessman in modern day Vienna.  Silva deserves much credit for refusing to let the unfinished business of The Holocaust to die in a time where there are those who would rewrite history and expect us to believe it never really happened.  Despite a predictable fate for Allon's prey, little solace can be taken when justice is finally served, when even vengeance offers no relief in the wake of cruelty of this scale.  This is fiction at its best: a lean, no-nonsense page-turner with a moral and a message, another masterpiece from today's most important spymaster.	2005-04-09
US	52172447	RDRKVZ2YTXF41	0060520469	556721931	Cadillac Beach	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Fiction's Gallagher	Tim Dorsey is to fiction what smashing watermelons with a sledgehammer is to comedy.  And that's not a bad thing, but it could get old if it were the only dimension to Dorsey's routine.  But what makes Dorsey's writing not only entertaining - but strangely addictive - is that infused within the frenetic pace of his offbeat humor and madcap characters lies an exceptional grasp of pop culture.  Dorsey, living vicariously through \\"Cadillac Beach's\\" Serge Storm, is clearly an ardent student of 20th century American history and a passionate defender of Florida's heritage.  Though well camouflaged behind his over-the-top brand of humor, Dorsey's biting social satire rivals that of Tom Wolfe or Carl Hiaasen.  As with Hiaasen, Dorsey relentlessly targets Florida's lunacy from all possible fronts, but from a more playful, less cynical, and certainly more bizarre - if less believable - perspective.  <br /> <br />\\"Cadillac Beach\\" is typical of Dorsey's fare - another loosely plotted light-speed paced chronicle of Serge's latest adventure.  Serge, that rare lovable but certifiably-insane-serial-killing-protagonist, has started a specialty travel service that treats customer to the link between Miami's past and present.  Dorsey weaves into this nutty tail interesting tidbits and trivia of Miami's past - Lucy, the Beatles, Cassius Clay and Sonny Liston, Goldfinger, and, most importantly, the infamous \\"Murf the Surf'\\" jewel heist of the Museum of Natural History in '64.  Throw in the Miami mob, the CIA, FBI, hookers, thugs, bums and dopers and you pretty much get the idea.  True to theme, \\"Cadillac\\" flashes back to Miami 1964-65, reliving the misadventures of Serge's grandfather Sergio and his misfit mob, as Serge tries to unravel the mystery of granddad's death.  Bullets, babes, drugs, and cops - the usual Dorsey stuff - and as always, it isn't the destination that matters, but the fun along the way.     <br />	2005-04-02

My worries could not have been more off the mark - Silva's Gabriel Allon is a remarkable character, combining the pragmatism and stealth of LeCarre's George Smiley with the bravado of Clancy's Jack Ryan.<br /><br />Following a devastating terrorist attack in Rome, Allon is draw out of semi-retirement to track down the perpetrator, possibly the apocryphal son and grandson of Palestinian terrorists with whom both Allon and mentor Ari Shamron have a history.  \\"Prince of Fire\\" is very loosely based on the history of Ali Hassan Salameh, Black Septembrist and architect of the slaughter at the Munich Olympics.  What follows is a well-crafted and thoroughly researched tale of Israeli espionage, as well as a riveting, if brief, history of the Palestinian conflict.  While the story centers on Allon's pursuit of the elusive Khaled al-Khalifa, the true villain in this story is Yasir Arafat, rightfully cast as the master terrorist with the blood of untold thousands of Jews and Palestinians on his hands.  This is a dark tale with few winners and many losers, a story of pyrrhic victory of some justice but limited revenge.<br /><br />While LeCarre's once fine writing has faded to the ramblings an apologist wallowing in his misguided views of the moral relativism of democracy, communism, and fascism, writers like Daniel Silva and Alan Furst continue to write spy stories with the passion that comes only with the clarity found in recognition of the existence of good and true evil.  While fiction, this is as compelling a lesson in contemporary Middle east history as it is entertaining; an intelligent and highly recommended read.	2005-03-27

At its core, it is the tale of a young German immigrant on the lam after being framed in the arson of P.T. Barnum's American Museum.  He soon finds himself in the throws of the \\"Whyos\\", a secret Irish gang of New York's infamous Five Points, through which he finds work first on a road crew, later as a sewer man of New York's famed subterranean maze, and finally as a member of the construction crew building the Brooklyn Bridge.  Such ambitious fare certainly holds much promise for the historical novel fan, but Gaffney clutters the plot and the history with a ham handed dose of feminism and related social topics.  To make matters worse, the utopian Whyos who, we are to believe, have maintained their stealth and secrecy by communicating through a complex language of song.  While Gaffney portrays the Whyos as tough and ruthless, these ludicrous singing bandits seem closer to \\"The West Side Story\\" than to \\"The Gangs of New York.\\"  Our young German hero - let's call him Frank Harris - the last of his several aliases - falls in love with the redoubtable Beatrice: pickpocket, whore, sometime murderer, and mol of the Whyos boss.  But in Gaffney's New York, girls like Beatrice are the salt of society, the true brains and fabric of both legal and illegal New York, held back only by men and the puritanical Victorian social mores of the day.<br /><br />The book could have survived all of this, were it not for Gaffney's total lack of atmosphere, suspense, or pace in the story.  Fires, explosions, murders, are conveyed with the drama of a Brooklyn Bridge machinery technical manual, and while despite endless pages describing the thoughts and feeling of Frank and Beatrice, they stir as much inspiration as a trip with Gaffney through New York's sewers.<br /><br />From the breathless praise lavished by Publishers Weekly, Booklist, and others, \\"Metropolis\\" was a novel I was really looking forward to devouring.  It is unfortunate that this book was so well received critically, but I suspect the reviewers were more enthralled with Gaffney's oh-so politically correct social commentary than in any true literary or entertainment talent.

The latest in the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series finds Cole inexplicably tied to the murder of a drifter behind a seedy Los Angeles strip mall. We learn that Cole never knew his father, but spent a good portion of his childhood running away from one traveling carnival to another in search of his apocryphal human-cannonball dad. \\"Forgotten Man's\\" Cole is not the typically wise-cracking, hard-hitting PI we've come to know in earlier works, but more somber and pensive and, if not exactly subdued, certainly more a reflective and serious Elvis. As the adult Cole flashes back to his fruitless childhood searches for the father he never knew, old pain and disappointment surface, blending with Cole's current funk over the breakup with longtime lover Lucy Chenier. With taut prose and staccato dialogue, Crais weaves a spellbinding mystery that keeps the reader guessing well into the second half of the book. And while hardcore Crais fans may yearn for more frequent Joe Pike-style mayhem, this is nonetheless a powerful and poignant tale of lost love, vengeance, remorse, and bittersweet redemption. Crais is among the top two or three writers of American crime fiction today; \\"The Forgotten Man\\" is more evidence of why.	2005-03-21

Narrowly escaping the Stalin purges, Stoianev finds himself in Paris, a small player on the wrong end of a social scene that is at the same time decadent and doomed.  Through an ever-changing secession of tyrants - from Fascists to Communists to Nazis - Furst traces the political upheaval in war torn Europe, the effects upon those of multiple nationalities living through it.  This is a tale more poignant than uplifting, but one thing for certain: Furst understands the passion and sacrifice of liberty; the desperate leaps from one false hope to the next one will take in finding freedom.  Furst's writing is not for everyone: LaCarre reads like Robert Ludlum by comparison.  Intricate, plodding, somber and dark, this is nonetheless powerful fiction, educational and ultimately enlightening.  As the purists of espionage and WWII fiction already know, Furst is the master of his game, and \\"Night Soldiers\\" is Furst at his finest.	2005-03-13

Storms, the maniacally compulsive defender of Florida history and lore.  Serge also is a serial killer, but allegedly a lovable one, given his penchant for delivering vigilante style justice to those so reprehensible as to make Serge look like a choirboy in comparison. In this loosely plotted tail, Jim Davenport and his mostly functional family unit move from the Midwest to suburbia Tampa, totally clueless to the mayhem and absurdity awaiting in what appears on the surface a tropical paradise.  But in the world of Tim Dorsey, nothing is normal, and the naïve Davenports are confronted with a stream of hookers, dopers, scam artists, sleazebags, and schixoids.  And that's just on the first day.  Dim Dorsey is often compared to Carl Hiassen, but compared to Dorsey, Hiassen's cynical rips on Florida look like something the Miami Bureau of Tourism would publish to drum up business.  If you're looking for nonstop satire on steroids, a cross between Natural Born Killers and The Keystone Cops, Tim Dorsey and \\"Triggerfish Twist\\" may be just the cure for caffeine addiction you're looking for.  For the rest of us, there is always Hiassen.	2005-03-12

An Owner's Manual for the Layman	That the talented Bill Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is informative is not surprising, but that is so entertaining is.  Written in a breezy, conversational style, Bryon literally tackles the mysteries of the universe, from the \\"Big Bang\\" theory to the birth of the earth to the creation of life itself, and lots of fun stuff in between.  Clearly, tongue-in-cheek title notwithstanding, this is not - could not be expected to be -  a comprehensive guide to science and the evolution of natural history.  Bryson's success lies not in revealing the answers to the questions of \\"why we are here and how did we get here,\\" but rather how much science can't explain despite the pains taken and progress made over centuries in trying to unravel these puzzles. If you've always suspected that those minds brilliant enough to figure out the theory of relativity, quantum physics, and black holes were a bit different than you and I, Bryson confirms this through his lively anecdotal sketches highlighting the eccentric and downright bizarre behaviors of scientists from Darwin to Einstein to DNA Nobel Laureate James Watson.  As Bryson wryly observes, the history of scientific discovery can be summarized in three stages: \\"first, people deny that it is true, then they deny it is important; finally they credit the wrong person.\\"  Packed with enough factoids and trivia to fill a lifetime of cocktail parties (\\"Did you know that atoms are so efficiently recycled that each of us likely contains a billion atoms once occupying Shakespeare or Genghis Khan?\\"), the pace is quick, unexpectedly funny, and liberally peppered with intrigue.  If you are looking for a \\"Nobel Prize How-To\\" manual, or if you get excited plowing through scientific formula and intellectual minutia, \\"A Short History...\\" is not for you.  But if you are awed by the vastness of the universe, the miracle of life, and the relative insignificance of humans when measured upon a scale of time and distance, this is a must read.read.	2005-02-20

That is about all the background necessary for Tom Wolfe to launch into another of his trademarked acerbic dissections of American society, this time aimed at the various strata of university life.  Wolfe is not here to judge or advance his own agenda - only to observe.  But no target is left unscathed by his rapier wit and his unique ability to expose the irony and inanity of any number of the sacred cows of higher eductaion.  Whether it is the hypocrisy of NCAA basketball, the shallow social stratification of fraternity boys and sorority girls, or the sanctimony of the left wing university educratic establishment, all are dispassionately skewered by Wolfe's blistering prose.  Even sweet young Charlotte, as she gradually succumbs to the pressures she initially abhors, suffers under Wolfe's inescapable eye.  And while she recovers the individuality that made her once so unique and desirable, Wolfe includes in the \\"new\\" Charlotte shell of cynicism thick enough to insure she'll never again accept nor be accepted by her humble mountain roots.  At some times darkly humorous and at others depressing, \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" is at all times entertaining; a revealing and powerful expose of campus life in 21st century America.  Like \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and \\"A Man in Full\\" before it, the treasure of  \\"Charlotte\\" is not in the final destination, but in the journey as seen through Wolfe's keen eye along the way.  Tom Wolfe may be America's most insightful chronicler modern society, and \\"Charlotte Simmons\\" is another example of the master at the top of his game.  Don't miss it.	2005-02-13

By spinning a vintage-Crichton thriller around the schemes of the fictional radical environmental group \\"NERF\\", this well researched foray into the foibles of the \\"greens\\" sticks a finger into the eye of the junk science and baseless fears spawned by real-life groups like \\"NERF\\", devious politicians, and worse, the sanctimonious but clueless Hollywood crowd.  In \\"State of Fear\\", the Greens, when confronted by facts and reams of evidence they can't counter, resort to name calling and bizarre conspiracy theories. So also will the critics of this novel scream of big government and big industry manipulation of Crichton and his sources.  But for those who have studied the facts and prefer some science behind the rantings and the headlines of the network talking heads, \\"State of Fear\\" will be as deliciously satisfying as the demise of Ted Bradley, the Martin Sheen-like idiot who experiences how one can truly be consumed by their misplaced beliefs.

That this was a risky venture for Phillips is evident in the reviews: seems readers either love it or late it.  I'm in the former camp: \\"Egyptologist\\" is a literary tour de force, clearly one of the best novels of the year - a haunting and darkly humorous expose into the soul, set in the social strata and relations between America, England, and Egypt mostly during and just after WWI.<br /><br />Phillips chooses as the narrative the journals of Ralph Trilipush, an insufferably egocentric and arrogant archaeologist on a quixotic quest to uncover the tomb of equivocal Egyptian pharaoh, the prurient Atum-hadu, alleged author of pornographic hieroglyphic verse.  In parallel to Trilipush's bombastic and self-adulatory journals, the story is told through correspondence three-decades hence from Harold Ferrell, a broken down an embittered Australian private investigator recounting a case in which he was tracking down the illegitimate offspring of a repentant multi-millionaire.  If this sounds convoluted, well, it is, but it is through this intrigue that the reader is slowly drawn into the story, not so much in finding out what happened, but how.  Those who would criticize Phillips for dropping clues blatantly and early have missed the point.  This is not a mystery per se, but rather a farce of unparalleled dimensions, as the reader chuckles at Ferrell, totally oblivious to his ham-handed detective work, and Trilipush's deliciously obnoxious and self-delusional ramblings chronicling his talents and rightful place in history.<br /><br />To disclose more risks spoiling some of the fun, but suffice to say that \\"The Egyptologist\\" is an extraordinarily clever novel, rich and authentic in detail, setting a platform through which Phillips unveils an uncanny talent for unsympathetically skewering human emotions of greed, love, ambition, and envy.  Phillips is not (thankfully) Agatha Christie - keep that in mind and you're likely enjoy an unhurried and thoughtful, if brutal, journey through Man's continued quest for immortality.

Doone finds himself on the wrong side of the local mobster/businessman Thadeus Trout, and through the botched ministrations of Trout's ham-fisted son and his sidekicks, Doone ends up a freeze-dried corpse.  Secretly dumped down a sinkhole and later discovered, Doone's shriveled corpse is mistaken for the mummy of an ancient Native American.  From there, the unfortunate former Mr. Doone becomes the objective of an entire rogues gallery of claimants, from the \\"Indian\\" Jimmy Feather, looking for an ancestor, to Doone's cheating wife and her oily Cuban boyfriend, to the \\"fireflies\\" - disciples of Doone's \\"church\\"- to the curator of the local shoe button hook museum.  There are some genuinely funny parts - Plato Scopes, the resident scientist of the button hook museum (third largest collection of button hooks east of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio) is the neurotic and lecherous nerd far more interesting than the more standard loser.  And Trout's \\"Bible Alive Museum\\" - think if Disney did the Old Testament - is clever and unique.  But unlike good satire, which succeeds by injecting credible situations with believable characters infused with small and well-timed doses of Keystone cops and caustic humor.  Hirschfeld's humor is unbalanced, overpowering the characters and thin plot, feeling forced, over the top and, in a word, just silly.  And he also doesn't know when to quit.  A hundred fewer pages and a couple fewer thefts of poor Shickie could have added some zip to what becomes, despite its zaniness, a sluggish pace.  In short, Hirschfeld may be zany, but so is SpongeBob SquarePants.  I'll stick with Hiaasen and Leonard.	2005-01-11

It is a killer hurricane that is the unlikely backdrop for \\"Stormy Weather\\".  A host of talented writers - Dave Barry and Tim Dorsey among the best - feast on the seemingly endless stream of absurdity provided by Florida's uniquely bizarre mix of rednecks, lowlifes, shysters, snowbirds, and corrupt politicians.  But none succeed in capturing Florida with the biting irony and black humor that Carl Hiaasen brings to the pages.  \\"Stormy Weather\\" is another outstanding example of social satire at its best: the insufferably shallow New York advertising man, the terminally corrupt Miami code inspector, the low-life con artist and her criminal sidekick, the sleazy mobile-home salesman and his cheating wife.  Back from Hiaasen's \\"Double Whammy\\" is the aberrant but lovable road-kill eating, swamp-loving \\"Skink\\", and black state trooper Jim Tile, as close to normal as one will find in a Hiaasen novel.  Even the \\"hero\\" is wacky - a human skull-juggling proprietor of an exotic wildlife exhibit. In the wake of a massively destructive hurricane, \\"Stormy Weather\\" chronicles the fictional - but highly plausible - descent of the swindlers, scammers, and criminals to prey on the victims of the storm.  If Hiaasen's usual complement of oddball characters is not enough, the cast is supplemented with packs of storm-liberated wild animals prowling the Miami suburbia.  Hiaasen's brilliant expose of the dark side of human nature is never preachy, but whose caustic humor leaves the reader alternating between knowing grins and out-loud guffaws.  In anticipation of the author's inevitably unique forms of justice that will be meted out to the miscreants, the pages fly.  In part poignant, biting, bawdy but always funny, \\"Stormy Weather\\" is another fine example of Hiaasen's literary wit.	2005-01-09

Thanks to Dean King, this incredible story of survival, determination, and the range of the human spirit are rekindled in \\"Skeletons on the Zahara.\\"  In the summer of 1815, Riley and crew of the Commerce, a US merchant square-rigger home ported in Middleton, Connecticut, while heading from Gibraltar for the Canary Islands, shipwrecked off the treacherous coast of northwest Africa.  Were it not for corroboration from a number of sources, including the published memoir of crewmember Archibald Robbins, this harrowing narrative of bondage and torture at the hands of the barbarous nomadic tribes of the Western Sahara Desert would simply not be believable.  But through painstaking research, including his own journey through the desert retracing Riley's steps of nearly two centuries before, author King does an extraordinary job of detailing the tribulations and sufferings of the \\"Commerces\\", as well illuminating the customs and culture of the Islamic tribes of a desolate corner of the planet that to this day is mostly forgotten and hardly changed since Riley's fateful voyage.  King wisely refrains from over-dramatizing the plight of Riley and his men; from the depths of depravity to the peaks of bravery and loyalty, of suffering and redemption, this story is best told unembellished.<br /><br />\\"Skeletons on the Zahara\\" is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in adventure, American history, nautical lore, Islamic culture, and the triumph of the soul over the body, and is yet additional proof to the old adage: fact is indeed stranger than fiction.	2004-12-27

For a less talented author, such a mishmash of themes, miscreants, plots, and subplots would be a disaster.  For Burke, it is yet another convoluted tale where the physical brutality barely overshadows the tortured souls of his unique and eclectic cast of characters.  Burke excels in demonic villains, personifications of evil with just a hint of the supernatural.  In \\"Dixie City Jam\\", the malefactor is neo-Nazi Will Buchalter, a psychopath who seems to materialize from the ether without the trace of a history.  The story is far to intricate to adequately encapsulate, but suffice to say that Buchalter, among others, has an unexplained interest in finding a sunken German submarine off the Louisiana Gulf coast that New Iberia detective Dave Robicheaux happened upon decades earlier while scuba diving.<br /><br />For those familiar with Burke's Robicheaux novels will not be disappointed with this dark and twisted story of hate and depravity.  Clete Purvis, Robicheaux's ex-NOPD partner, provides welcome black humor as he demonstrates increasingly more creative techniques of mayhem as an art form.  But \\"Dixie City Jam\\" nearly collapses under the weight of Burke's liberal social commentary.  That Burke, as reflected through Robicheaux, has a message is not in itself a problem, but in this iteration he allows his rhetoric to ramble, adding unnecessary pages and overbearing gloom to the always-humorless Robicheaux.  In short, this is not Burke's best effort - \\"Last Car to Elysian Fields\\", \\"Burning Angel\\", or \\"Jolie Blon's Bounce\\" - are all more gripping and less preachy efforts.

While WWII novels tend to favor heroic and highly visible land and sea military campaigns, Furst chooses the shadowy and unheralded Allied merchant marine fleet as the setting for this realistic spy story.  Dutch merchant sailor Eric DeHann, captain of the Dutch tramp freighter Noordendam, is granted the Dutch Royal Navy commission he'd desired prior to Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.  But with much of 1941 Europe under German occupation, DeHann's rank and position must stay as secret as the mission upon which he and his crew of fugitives are about to embark.  Given a new paint job, the Noordendam is transformed into the Santa Rosa, sailing under the flag of neutral Spain.  After taking on cargo in Portugal, DeHann and company head for the Nazi-controlled Baltic Sea with the goal of delivering their clandestine load to the Allied resistance operating in southern Sweden.  Rich in the detail from the dark allies of northern Africa, to life aboard a tramp freighter from the Mediterranean, to the stormy seas of the Baltic, Furst succeeds in creating a fictional account of likely historical fact.<br /><br />While there are some generally tense moments, \\"Dark Voyage\\" will mostly appeal to the aficionado of Naval history or World War II.  The authentic but sometimes tedious nautical terms and minutia may leave the landlubber adrift, while the faithful depiction of a spy's life of interminable downtimes punctuated by relatively brief flashes of action may prove tiresome for some.  And if in the reader is left with a frustrating sense of ambiguity, it is reflective of the often-thankless job of wartime intelligence that Furst captures so well. \\"Dark Voyage\\" is a painfully researched and well-executed effort, illuminating the overlooked contributions of WWII's unsung heroes of the merchant fleet.

US	52172447	R2ROZMHIIIAYCA	0525948430	518961183	Whiteout	Books	4	52	60	N	Y	A Blizzard of Bio-Terror	Set in Oxenford Medical, a biomedical facility in Scotland, a lab technician is found dead at home, presumably the victim of a deadly Ebola virus variant housed at the facility.  Beautiful and brainy females are often front-and-center in Ken Follett novels; in \\"Whiteout\\" it is Toni Gallo, former cop and current director of security for Oxenford, developer of anti-viral drugs to combat these deadly viruses.  It is these drugs that attract the attention of a band of international burglars, commissioned by a presumed competitor to steal Oxenford's latest research. Kit Oxenford, the spoiled and sniveling son of Oxenford founder and CEO Stanley Oxenford, was the designer of the lab's security systems before being dumped from the firm for embezzlement.  Up to his eyeballs in gambling debt and furious with his father for not cashing him out, the despicable Kit joins the band of thugs, providing all the information needed to override Oxenford security.  But as the freak Christmas Eve storm shifts course towards the Scottish coast, this story of high-tech thievery becomes a tale as much about the weather as it is about bio-terrorism.<br /><br />While this unlikely story is predictable and a bit over embellished, it is nonetheless gripping entertainment, hooking the reader in the first few pages and keeping them turning until the last bad guy is finally dispatched.  Follett is never one to let rationality get in the way of a good story, and \\"Whiteout\\" is no exception - to the reader's benefit.  A bit of a Robin Cook bio-thriller with some \\"Die Hard\\" thrown in, Follett's lean prose demonstrates again his uncanny ability as a storyteller, cranking out page-after page of non-stop action unadorned by fine literary baggage.  While few characters in \\"Whiteout\\" are memorable, the brutish \\"Daisy\\" adds an interesting new dimension to the familiar psycho-thug, while the terminally dysfunctional Oxenford family provided some black comedy along with critical plot content.  As long as the reader doesn't spend inordinate time dissecting the plot or the characters, and isn't overly distracted by some heavy-handed schmaltz, \\"Whiteout\\" is indeed terrific entertainment - the written-word version of that holiday season film the critics love to hate but viewers love to see.he reader doesn't spend inordinate time dissecting the plot or the characters, and isn't overly distracted by some heavy-handed schmaltz, \\"Whiteout\\" is indeed terrific entertainment - the written-word version of that holiday season film the critics love to hate but viewers love to see.    <br />	2004-11-29
US	52172447	R8HVIG930ESUJ	0684872544	967310766	Wolves Eat Dogs	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Black Villages and Red Forests	Five years after Russian investigator Arkady Renko's last adventure was published, the somewhat disappointing \\"Havana Bay\\", both Martin Cruz Smith and Renko are back in top form in the unforgettable \\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\".  In \\"Wolves\\", Renko battles the Moscow bureaucracy in unwinding the apparent but inexplicable suicide of Pasha Ivanov, a billionaire member of the \\"New Russia\\" brand of capitalism.  But the even more mysterious death of Ivanov's closest business associate draws Renko from Moscow the Ukaine's post-nuclear meltdown wasteland of Chernobyl.  Smith's writing typically reflects an austere, mournful quality, reflective of the Russian culture he so convincingly captures.  But set in the barren surrounds of the infamous \\"Chernobyl Four\\" and the sarcophagus that entombs it, the author layers new dimensions to dementia and the macabre.  \\"The Zone\\", as it is referred to by those unfortunate enough to reside there, is a land where radiation detectors are more common than wrist watches, a vast expanse inhabited by only the most desperate scavengers and poachers, the volunteer scientists and ecologists, and militia members lacking even enough pull for assignment to the dreaded, but less formidable, permafrost of Siberia.  That Renko would be assigned to investigate in such a dangerous and nefarious place is a measure of how difficult it has been for this Soviet-era holdover to assimilate with the politics of \\"New Russia\\".<br /><br />Empathic and deeply human but never maudlin, Smith captures the pathos and spirit of a land and people that history has already forgotten in the short 18 years since the nuclear disaster made pariahs of the survivors and rendered over 1,000 square miles uninhabitable.  Beautifully written, deeply allegorical, and painstakingly researched, \\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\" is a stunning and sobering effort from an author whose name is synonymous with quality fiction.  But if that were not enough, this is a deeply satisfying, old-fashioned mystery, sure to keep pages turning and the reader guessing until the end.  \\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\" is an  intelligent read; an outstanding example of one of today's greatest popular writers at the top of his craft.  Don't miss it.to keep pages turning and the reader guessing until the end.  \\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\" is an  intelligent read; an outstanding example of one of today's greatest popular writers at the top of his craft.

Given the consistent quality of Hiaasen's prolific and wickedly funny skewering of south Florida and its wacky inhabitants, it is difficult to pick a Hiaasen \\"best\\", but \\"Skin Tight\\" is definitely a contender.  In other works, Hiaasen has taken on south Florida institutions from televangelism to trophy bass fishing to stripping.  In \\"Skin Tight\\", he tackles cosmetic surgery as the unlikely but content-rich target.  Fans of this summer's Hiaasen bestseller, \\"Skinny Dip\\", will find this introduction to retired state investigator Mick Stranahan a somewhat darker and more grisly prequel.  Cast with the author's usual collection of miscreants, sleaze balls, corrupt officials and incompetent crooks, \\"Skin Tight\\" ricochets from one bizarre and brutal high jinx to next, each one more depraved and disturbed than the previous.  Given the seemingly endless stream of mayhem and murder in this zany tale, superlatives are risky, but certainly the method in which two terminally corrupt Miami detectives are dispatched is especially memorable.<br /><br />Yet at the core of Hiaasen's carefully crafted chaos and black humor lies an insightful dissection of the shallowness and material corruption of American culture.  In a tribute to Hiaasen's skills considerable literary skills, these messages never overshadow the entertainment value, nor require \\"progressive\\" political views to be appreciated.  Ironic, sarcastic, and biting, \\"Skin Tight\\" represents another page-turner from Carl Hiaasen, today's undisputed master of mordancy.	2004-11-23

As a continuation - albeit an important link - \\"Drawing\\", depending upon both its predecessor and successor, has neither a definitive beginning nor ending.  It is nonetheless a brilliant work of fiction, offering vivid insight into the twisted imagination of Steven King.  Who but King, in this deformed and misshapen synthesis of Tolkien, The Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, and Clint Eastern spaghetti westerns, would choose a neurotic male drug addict and a black female amputee as fledgling gunslingers destined to travel alongside the enigmatic Roland of Gilead?  Where but from King's distorted psyche could the terminally dangerous yet tragically comical \\"lobstrocities\\" be born?  Any review of a few hundred words is woefully inadequate to describe the genius of King's \\"Dark Tower\\", knowing full well that questions left unanswered are simply teasers to be satisfied somewhere on King's tortuous and unhurried journey to the Tower.  Just as our novice gunslingers Odetta/Detta and Eddie Dean find themselves increasingly and inescapably drawn to the quest, so also is the reader sucked into King's diabolical journey.  Read it at your own risk.	2004-11-23

Set in the post-World War south fork of Long Island, it is the tale of Conrad Labarde, a Basque immigrant fisherman who hauls a dead girl from the surf in his fishing nets.  The dead girl, Lillian Wallace, is a member of the New York aristocracy who \\"summer\\" on Hampton's beaches.  As Mills patiently unwinds the story, we learn that the stoic Labarde is a highly decorated war hero, having served in a secretive commando team in the European theatre.  But this is but one of the secrets that gradually materialize in the rigid demarcations between Amagansett's opposing social strata's.<br /><br />At times slow moving, rambling in others, \\"Amagansett\\" is nonetheless beautifully written and carefully researched.  If you appreciate a bit of history as well as some education in your fiction, you'll find both in this largely overlooked period between WWII and the Cold War, and the somewhat obscure and forgotten dunes and fishing towns of Long Island.  The characters, if somewhat stereotyped, have depth and hold interest, especially in the vivid portrait of the virtually extinct culture of east coast shore fishermen.  The standard clich&eacute;s of the evil rich and the noble poor threaten at times to overpower the story, but Mills atones with a climax that is genuinely thrilling and features a few unexpected twists.  All things considered, this complex and elegant novel is an impressive debut; I suspect we'll be hearing much more of Mark Mills.	2004-11-11

And as the first of King's seven-volume \\"Dark Tower\\" epic, it does read much more as an introduction than as a standalone novel.  But these disclaimers not withstanding, \\"Gunslinger\\" is powerful fiction, giving the reader a glimpse into the powerful and twisted imagination that is uniquely Stephen King's, effectively setting the hook for much more to come.   A little bit Star War's Jedi Knight, a little bit Sergio Leone's \\"Man without a Name\\", King's Roland of Gilead, the last of an ancient warrior sect, pursues the mysterious and malevolent \\"man in black\\" across a desert wasteland.  In \\"Gunslinger\\", time and place are but vague concepts surely to be gradually unveiled as the series continues.  Through a combination of events that unwind in Roland's pursuit, and recollections from his Spartan-like childhood and early friendships and love, readers of King's later works - The Stand, Black House, and many more - will recognize in \\"Gunslinger\\" familiar themes.  Familiar also are King's razor-sharp writing skills, layering both characters and settings grain-by-grain across a bleak and malignant landscape in King's unmistakable style.  Like a well-done movie trailer, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is a masterful setup to what is certainly to be the poignant and suspenseful narrative of \\"The Dark Tower\\" that will follow.  Few can match King's abilities for telling a story; this is the beginning of what is arguable his magnum opus.	2004-10-23

Few superlatives would exaggerate the power of his lyrical prose; the lucid images his words conjure.  Burke's southern Louisiana bayous are no mere backdrops in which a mystery is dropped, but such forceful allegory that character and plot sometimes must play a secondary role to his poetry.  But therein lies the problem - Burke's mood and moodiness, as reflected in the character of Dave Robicheaux, can eventually wear down even the most ardent Burke fan. Nowhere is this sense of despair and desperation more apparent than in \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\", the second in the Robicheaux series.  Ostensibly a thriller/mystery involving a suspicious plane crash and Robicheaux's unofficial investigation of the forces behind it, this is really the tale of Robicheaux's (and Burke's, one would assume) internal struggles with alcoholism, guilt, self-doubt, and eventual revenge.  In the Louisiana of \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\", it seems to rain only slightly less than in \\"Blade Runner\\", providing the perfect settings for the author's rather bleak outlook on culture, love, and the inequities of life in general.  Bleeding heart liberalism is always lurking surreptitiously between the lines of Burke's fiction, though in this one, the cause of Burke's despair is less apparent.  In summary, \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" is an effort typical of Burke's superb literary skills, though not his finest.  If the reader is looking for redemption as a reward of following Burke's meandering journey of self-pity and doubt, I fear that, like our hero Robicheaux, in the end will come up short.	2004-10-19

In \\"Running Blind\\", Reacher actually strings together more than two consecutive sentences, expresses conflicting emotions, and considers - ever briefly - \\"settling down\\".  Yikes!  Next we'll hear than Howard Dean is voting for \\"W\\".  This is Child's fourth Reacher installment and, while definitely not his best, is still another fine example of Child's lean, unadorned prose, sticking close to the plot and keeping the reader in suspense.  In a plot somewhat less believable than most we've come to expect from Child, Reacher is drawn into a series of bizarre murders of women all that've had a connection to Reacher.  Most engaging is the manner in which these women died - no one can find a cause.  The mystery involving the murders keeps the reader guessing to the end that, if a bit far-fetched, is certainly clever.  If you're a Lee Child fan, you'll want to read \\"Running Blind\\".  But if you've not yet been exposed to this fine writer of popular mystery/thrillers, I'd recommend becoming a fan first: start with  \\"Tripwire\\", Killing Floor\\", or, my favorite, \\"Persuader\\".	2004-10-17

And in many ways, that terrific film was a faithful rendering of James Dickey's classic.  Yet, as with most successful films based on successful novels, the written form allows much more interest, more depth, more nuance.  \\"Deliverance\\" the novel is so well written that a single sentence can conjure 1,000 frames of film, a paragraph an entire scene.  James Dickey is better known for poetry than fiction, and the lyrical quality of his prose is well evident in this journey of four Atlanta businessman down a raging north Georgia river.  Told in the first person by Ed Gentry (Jon Voight in the film), \\"Deliverance\\" is a gripping adventure story, but also of one humiliation, murder, tragedy, and ultimately a soul searching study of one man's struggle with courage, morality, and ethics.  Dickey offers an unapologetic and unflattering portrait of the hill people of northern Georgia, yet without malice or prejudice - simply the necessary backdrop to serve as the physical manifestation from which there can be \\"deliverance\\".  Fiercely told and every bit as suspenseful as the excellent film, this great classic should be read by all lovers of American fiction.	2004-10-10

Backed by exhaustive research, Bozell recounts case-after-case backed by statistic- after-statistic of how the media distorts the news to promote their biased points-of-view.  The media elite, Bozell correctly contents, sanctimoniously assumes the exalted position of America's cultural and moral arbiter and watchdog, positioning minority views as mainstream.  Meanwhile, conservatives are consistently labeled and derided -blatantly or more subtlety - while liberals and liberal causes are given a free pass.  But more than simply distorting the news as reported, Bozell cites numerous examples - the 2000 Presidential Election, Elian Gonzalez, the war of terrorism - where the media actually influences events rather than simply reporting them.  \\"Weapons of Mass Distortion\\" takes head-on the ludicrous claims of Al Franken and Eric Altman that there is in fact a conservative bias to the news.  Not that further proof is needed, but the recent CBS \\"memo gate\\" debacle, and the even more recent ABC memo clearly instructing favorable coverage for Kerry at Bush's expense, again validates the truth of Bozell's words.<br /><br />Fast moving, well paced, and well written, this is still a frustrating book.  Frustrating in the sense that, despite gains by cable channels like Fox News, alternative press like The Washington Times and The New York Post, and more balanced news accessible on the Internet, the old media still maintains a stranglehold on much of America's audience, shaping thought and opinion to coincide with the minority views of the media establishment.

Wilcox's history of the Pacific War from the perspective of our fighter pilots on the carriers Enterprise and Hornet was particularly gripping, especially the critically important battles of Guadalcanal and Guam.  Those not intimately familiar with the history of the War with Japan in the Pacific may be surprised at how woefully out manned and outgunned the US fleet was, especially following the crippling attack on Pearl Harbor.  Yet the incredible odds surmounted by the US forces testify to the valor and bravery of pilots like Voris and his peers who, only a matter of months prior, were merely young and untrained American civilians.  Yet while Voris' combat missions during WWII provide more than enough content for a complete book, this was only the prelude to the story of the Blue Angels.<br /><br />In short, for the Naval history buff, \\"First Blue\\" is an indispensable addition to the library.  But more importantly, in the troubled times in which we live, the story of Butch Voris is a true inspiration and beacon of bright light - the epic of a great American patriot who, through humility and quite accomplishment, embodies all that we should hold dear in our leaders and our heroes.	2004-10-08

I could hardly have been more disappointed.  I'll give credit for an interesting setting and a premise that may have worked, had Brumfield researched the ancient Mayan culture in more depth, and tied the mysteries of the Mayans into a modern day thriller.  Unfortunately, \\"Tourist\\" augured into a typical - though more poorly conceived - government conspiracy fantasy featuring a plastic cast of characters and numbingly banal plot.  Jack Phillips, around whom the story revolves, is insufferably whiny and as uninspiring a protagonist as I've encountered.  This plot depends upon the reader's belief that a team from the US DEA has gone undercover in Mexico as drug dealers.  It must never have occurred to the author that the DEA may consider using Latinos in these roles; the southern Cal frat-boy agents assigned south-of-the-border were about as inconspicuous in Mexico as Shaquille O'Neal at a Ku Klux Klan rally.  The dialogue was consistently lame (\\"What had happened was not fair, but life was not fair.\\")  But much of the awkward prose and flat dialogue could have been overlooked were it not exacerbated by the most atrocious editing I have ever seen in a published work.  [...]<br /><br />At one point, one of the James Bond-type undercover guys, while en route to the final encounter with the bad guys, says to Phillips, \\"I'm just making this up as I go along.\\"  That pretty much sums up \\"A Tourist in the Yucatan\\".

Like the dark and brooding \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Shutter Island\\" is a departure from the successful formula of Lehane's gritty Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro mysteries. The time is 1954, the setting, Shutter Island, a bleak and desolate place not far from Boston, home of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  Those familiar with Lehane's writings will find the somber palette of words familiar, but the period, theme, characters, and plot move in a foreign but ambitious direction.  It is the story of Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule, U.S. Marshals on an assignment to Ashecliffe to investigate the baffling escape from a locked room of inmate Rachel Solano.  The hospital is rumored to have conducted illegal brain surgery on the patients, adding another layer of intrigue to an already spooky setting, a cross between noir crime fiction and gothic horror.  As the mysterious Solano's ghastly past unwinds, the mystery deepens as clues and rationale cease to reach conventional conclusions.  Surprising, even for the talented Lehane, is the Hitchcockian command of surprise and plot twists he executes with a deft ease, slamming the reader with the same impact of the hurricane that rocks the island in one of the novels many vivid scenes.  \\"Shutter Island\\" is a novel that will shock and physically stagger, a true classic of modern fiction that once read will not be forgotten, and must not be missed.	2004-09-25

For as prolific and Hiaasen is, one gets the impression that he still can't write fast enough to keep up with the wacky content streaming from Florida's zany residents.  Hiaasen's talent lies in his unique ability to extract these nuggets of the bizarre from everyday life, and spin around them stories that while cynically and darkly hilarious, still have a ring of truth and reality.<br /><br />In \\"Double Whammy\\", Hiaasen takes on a pair of unlikely bedfellows: professional bass fishing and TV evangelism.  R.J. Decker is the `hero\\", but true to the author's anything-but-conventional approach to fiction, this hero is an ex-con with a hair-trigger temper who lives in a trailer park.  But compared to the road kill-eating hermit, \\"Skink\\", he pals around with, Decker by comparison is a rock of sanity and normalcy.  To this throw in an assorted cast of oily Florida bass-fishing millionaires, a corrupt Jimmy Swaggart-like TV preacher, a pair of Florida redneck murderous brothers, and the pro-bass fishing tournament crowd all slogging through black-water swamps and drainage ditches. Bodies pile up, but typical of Hiaasen fair, even as the creative brutality of the murders accelerates, the reader is more likely to chuckle than cringe.  The dialogue is harp and witty, the pace relentless.<br /><br />In short, a manic and imaginative ride through Florida's backwaters that could only come from Carl Hiaasen's twisted but insightful mind.

Eclipsed in the history of New York City only by 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, O'Donnell chronicles the last voyage of the steamboat General Slocum.  On June 15, 1904, the General Slocum departed the piers of lower-eastside New York, carrying a group of over 1,300 German-Americans looking forward to the annual Sunday School picnic on the Long Island Sound.  But never venturing beyond the East River, and within less than an hour of leaving the pier, over 1,000 passengers, mostly women and children, would burn or drown.  O'Donnell captures this unfathomable tragedy with sensitivity and pathos, writing with the precision of an accomplished historian but the pace and drama of a seasoned novelist.  His portrait of New York at the turn-of-the-century is vivid and believable, conveying just the right amount of cultural and physical background to the story.  In building the case, O'Donnell's indictment of those responsible for this wholly preventable conflagration is razor-sharp, as much John Grisham as it is David McCullough.  Adella Liebenow, a six-month old infant on the fateful day, was the Slocum's youngest survivor.  At the time \\"Ship Ablaze\\" was written in 2002, Adella was 98, and the last survivor of the Slocum's last cruise.  With all livings memories of this terrible story about to die, we are fortunate to have Mr. O'Donnell's gut-wrenching but beautifully written tribute to the victims recorded for posterity.	2004-09-23

Yet almost as amazing as the advancement of Chinese technology and navigation that led to this achievement is China's historical withdrawal from the west in the same century these monumental discoveries took place.  There are those who've claimed to have read this book, but whose misguided western egos somehow won't allow them to open their minds and base their conclusions on the evidence presented by Menzies.  Perhaps these small minds will take some solace in the fact that while China had indeed achieved cultural and technological heights far beyond those of contemporary western civilizations, that through their own brand of nationalistic arrogance, failed to capitalize on these advancements, returning instead to a closed and insular society.  In short, an intriguing thesis, that can't help leave one wondering, \\"what would have happened if ...?\\"	2004-09-12

Child's hulking loner Jack Reacher certainly has the mind of an assassin, and in \\"Without Fail\\", he is contracted by Secret Service agent M.E. Froelich to audit the security for the Vice President of the United States, the target of a threatened assassination.  Froelich happens to be the former lover of Reacher's older brother, Joe, the former Treasury Department agent killed in action years before.  What follows is an extremely credible portrayal of the US Secret Service and the challenges they face in protecting the holders of our highest public offices.  As with all Child/Reacher novels, this one is well researched rich in detail.  But just as the detail begins to hint at tedium, Child metes out another measure of plot twist, keeping the reader anxiously waiting for the next installment.  Lee Child is a true student of pace, understanding the fine balance between plot development and action.  Reacher's no-nonsense perspective on justice, crime and punishment is faithfully intact, but in \\"Without Fail\\", we meet Reacher's female equivalent, the formidable and lethal Frances Neagley, an ex-Army buddy of Reacher's.  Like Child's hero, this is an austere, blunt, and powerful novel, ultimately predictable but never disappointing along the way.  Entertainment in print simply does not get much better than this.	2004-09-11

But Dorsey's Florida is a step or two beyond Hiaasen - more cynical, reckless, even suicidal - perhaps what Hiaasen would write during a week-long amphetamine binge.<br /><br />\\"Hammerhead Ranch Motel\\" is less a plot than a series of vignettes, as each character passing by or through the bizarre Hammerhead Ranch Motel (think Texas'Cadillac Ranch with stuffed Hammerhead sharks instead of Cadillacs) is even aberrant than the one before.  Back from Dorsey's \\"Florida Roadkill\\" debut is Serge Storm, who is living proof that only in the pages of a Dorsey novel can a serial killer be the likeable hero(well, as likeable as a guy who conducts taxidemy on live humans can be). This is a book that defies definition by traditional standards, an \\"evenly pace\\" experience as long as \\"pace\\" exists in the spectrum reaching from light speed to ludicrous.  Aside from Florida's typical delights of forest fires, hurricanes, murder, and mayhem, there is a Buick with $5-million in the trunk cruising around Florida's freeways.  If you don't have much of a life planned for the next several hours, go ahead and pick up \\"\\"Hammerhead\\" - it will be a ride you'll remember for a while.	2004-09-11

Aside from the horror of the fire, which literally cannot be described in words (how can one adequately describe the impact of a 1,000 foot-high wall of fire moving at speeds exceeding 100 miles-per-hour), \\"Firestorm at Peshtigo\\" offers fascinating insight to life in the north-central timber forests of the mid-nineteenth century, as well as the infant science of meteorology and the physics of a true firestorm.  Notwithstanding, the books primary appeal lies in the almost ghoulish detail in which the incomprehensible devastation of the firestorm is drawn.  While the final loss of life will never be known, 2,200 deaths is an accepted estimate in a fire that raged over 2,400 square miles - a conflagration so intense that even the soil burned.  Given the primitive state of medicine of the day, the limited communications and access to the relatively remote Green Bay area, and the total destruction of the land and infrastructure, one wonders if the survivors of the fire, scarred both physically and mentally by the fire and loss of family and community, weren't the true victims.<br /><br />In short, a brutally fascinating nugget of American history, proving again that fact is indeed stranger, and in this case, more lurid, than fiction.	2004-09-05

As with all of Childs' Reacher novels, there is nothing fancy about the plot: bad guys are up to no good, and former military cop/current drifter Jack Reacher steps in to set the record straight.  In \\"Echo\\", we find Reacher hitching across the desolate southwest plains in the furnace that is summer in Texas.  He's picked up by Carmen Greer, a lovely but troubled Latina who's married into a locally powerful family of ranchers.  Carmen spins a tail of spousal abuse and discrimination, about to get worse with her husband's imminent release from prison following an IRS scam.  She begs Reacher to intervene on her behalf, and, after initial hesitation, he agrees to stick around long enough to check out Greer's story.  What follows is a fast-paced tale involving local politics, illegal immigrants, and long-buried family skeletons.  As usual, while serving as judge, jury, and executioner, the stoic Reacher makes Clint Eastwood's \\"man-without-a-name\\" look positively loquacious by comparison.  And as always, Childs' prose is tight, efficient, and compelling, never failing to keep the pages turning.  While Reacher's brand of frontier justice may be unrealistic, it leaves this reader yearning for the clarity and purity of Childs' notions of good and evil.  Pure adrenaline, pure entertainment - read it!	2004-08-23

Buffa's \\"Breach of Trust\\", while not exactly a page-turner, is an interesting novel.  Buffa's super-defense attorney Joseph Antonelli is back, this time the reluctant defendant of his former Harvard law school roommate, Thomas Browning, who happens to be the Vice President of the United States.  A decades-old death - apparently accidental - of a young woman from the Antonelli/Browning circle of friends resurfaces with a politically motivated vengeance.  What follows is a convoluted plot of conspiracies and politics, dredging up long buried secrets while challenging friendships, loyalties, and values.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Breach of Trust\\" suffers from Buffa's pretentious - if not bombastic - windy and preachy prose.  Characters are philosophically somber and cynical to a fault, lending to a setting unnecessarily morose and humorless. The left-leaning Buffa definitely has a political axe to grind, bordering on yet another thinly veiled attack on the current Bush administration.  But to give credit to the author, the end salvages some sense of political ambiguity and neutrality.  At its best, it is a stinging indictment of politics in America, while at its worst, \\"Breach of Trust\\" is a bleak and pessimistic assessment of government and justice in America.  Intelligent fiction?  For sure, but at times frustrating, occassionally simply boring, and A book one you'll not find hard to put down.	2004-08-22

But this gripping thriller just may be good enough to break out of the pack, joining that elite circle of popular fiction that enters the mainstream, showing up everywhere(like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\") in planes and on beaches around the world.  A novel that is enjoyed not only by hardcore bibliophiles but also by the casual reader who may read only a book or two each year.  \\"Brimstone\\" may be the thriller that fills the bill where \\"The Rule of Four\\" fell short - satisfying the cravings of Da Vinci Code readers looking for an encore.<br /><br />Pentergast, teamed up again with Preston/Child veterans Vincent D'Agosta and Laura Hayward, investigate a bizarre series of gruesome murders that by all indications may literally be the work of the Devil.  As typical for Preston/Childs, the mystery is meticulously researched and rich in detail, lending credibility but never getting in way of action that keeps the pages turning.  The authors add additional dimension to impossibly urbane Pentergast, who is arguably the most fascinating serial-protagonist in current fiction of this genre.  For those readers not familiar with Pentergast, picture a southern gentleman the combination of James Bond and Hannibal Lecter, without Lecter's unusual culinary tastes.  The intricate plot is carefully crafted, seeded with subtle literary and historical references.  And while \\"Brimstone\\" is not without flaws  - some may find the cliffhangers escalating to a point where credibility is strained just to the breaking point - any criticism pales against this wonderfully intelligent and entertaining mystery/thriller.<br /><br />Whether or not \\"Brimstone\\" generates enough buzz to enter the rarified air of cross-over pop fiction classics like \\"The Firm\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Jaws\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", or the more recent \\"Da Vinci Code\\", remains to be seen, but this is nonetheless a novel not to be missed.e recent \\"Da Vinci Code\\", remains to be seen, but this is nonetheless a novel not to be missed. <br /> <br />	2004-08-22

Hiaasen's character development is, as always, masterful.  Seldom has there been a more diabolically sleazy slacker than Charles \\"Chaz\\" Perrone, perhaps the only marine biologist in the western hemisphere who thinks the Gulf Stream flows north-to-south.  Perrone is literally waist deep in a scheme to fake pollution readings in the Everglades, protecting for profit the corrupt good-old-boy mega-farmer Red Hammernut.  When Chaz suspects his lovely wife Joey has stumbled onto his latest indiscretion, Chaz arranges an anniversary ocean cruise and, when the opportunity presents itself, flips her overboard to a certain death.  But former college swimming start Joey miraculously survives and, with the help of Mick Stranahan, retired cop and Dinner Key loner, cooks up a deliciously villainous plan of  revenge on the unsuspecting and clueless Chaz.  From the Boca Raton condo's to the tomato fields of Red's Everglades plantations, Hiaasen never allows the witty dialogue and lively pace to slow a Miami minute.  Well told tales of vengeance are irresistible reading, and with a great cast of unforgettable supporting characters and Hiaasen's razor sharp cynical commentary, this may very well be the summer's most enjoyable beach read.  Don't miss it.	2004-08-02

Is argument is presented with clarity and fact - as well fed affluent bureaucrats of the EU, the UN, the US, and any number of environmental protection groups force their unfounded radical views on developing nations, the basic steps in economic evolution to these nations are being denied, virtually eliminating any hope for improvement.  Issues ranging from alternative energy source, genetically modified food, sweatshop labor, global warming and others are reviewed in enough detail to make the points, sparing the reader of the often endless graphs, charts, and minutia that often accompany books of this type.  In an interesting twist, Driessen does not limit this criticism to the political bureaucrats and radical activists, but also points a finger at global corporations.  On one hand, rather than standing up to the junk science and extreme positions of the radical green movement, most large corporations are simply rolling over, acquiescing to these economically dangerous demands. On the other hand, a number of corporations - most notably BP, to which Driessen delivers some well-deserved body blows - are allowing the Greens to play into their hands, duping the public into believing their pro-environmental purity, while in fact simply spinning clever PR smoke.  BP, for example, would profit greatly from acceptance of the Kyoto accord through their natural gas business, while continuing to grow oil revenues and profit.<br /><br />Drinker of the Green Kool Aid will undoubtedly dismiss 'Eco-Imperialism' out-of-hand, falling back on their tired and tiresome accusations of Driessen as simply another 'corporate pawn.'  However, as Driessen so forcefully articulates, it is in fact the fat cat bureaucrat environmentalists and politicians who are profiting at the expense of struggling third world nations.  This is a proactive and chilling expose - should be required reading in all US Public Schools, if for no other reason as balance to the steady diet green pabulum our students are fed today.cat bureaucrat environmentalists and politicians who are profiting at the expense of struggling third world nations.

I understand that Coben is a prolific writer with a large fan base, but I found Coben, at least in this effort, far inferior to today's best writers of crime fiction: Dennis Lehane, James Lee Burke, and Lee Childs all do a better job with plot, setting, and characters. And if you prefer to add witty dialogue and one-liners to that mix, consider Robert Crais, William Lashner, or David Rosenfelt (who also does a better north Jersey).<br /><br /> In 'One False Move', ex-basketball star and current sports agent Myron Bolitar agrees to protect Brenda Slaughter, the bright and beautiful star of the WNBA, the women's professional basketball league. Her mother had deserted Brenda some twenty years ago, and now her father, Horace Slaughter, has vanished. Bolitar has a personal stake in this, as Horace was Myron's mentor as he was rising through the ranks of amateur basketball. This seemingly innocent assignment begins unraveling a sordid 20-year old tale of bad love, murder, deception, corruption and power.<br /><br /> Perhaps a reader needs a couple of installments of Myron Bolitar to appreciate him, but I couldn't figure out what Coben was trying to do with himr. While the big ex-jock persona was incongruous with the indecisive, somewhat neurotic mamas boy image, neither of these fit with the gun-toting tough guy always ready with a snappy wisecrack. We are to believe that Myron, who struggles to decide whether or not he some make is assistant a partner in his firm, and who only recently moved out of his parent's home, can stand down ruthless mobsters and power-crazed gubernatorial candidates? Believe that, and you probably can believe that, as positioned in this story, the WNBA really does matter. But while Bolitar was somewhat of an enigma, Bolitar sidekick Winston Lock-Horne manages to add an entirely new dimension to 'annoying'. (As an example, in answering his phone, the insufferable 'Win' inserts 'articulate' for 'hello). The reader is to believe that the manicured and polished Win, of old money and Ivy League society, is really a Clint Eastwood in a blue blazer and tasseled loafers. Yet the mere mention of this pretty-boy's name sends chills down the spine of even the most hardened of New Jersey's mobsters. Right.<br /><br /> Add to this a plot that is wholly unbelievable, cluttered with a love tangent that turns as sappy as it is unnecessary, and you have 'One False Move', fiction that while mildly entertaining leaves little to recommend it.his phone, the insufferable 'Win' inserts 'articulate' for 'hello).

The similarity in the subject matter between &quot;The Rule of Four&quot; and Da Vinci has led to the inevitable comparisons that are unfair, as these are two very different books. While Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason?s debut may not maintain Dan Brown's pace and adrenalin, it is an intelligent read, well written and sensitive, displaying a wisdom and literary talent far beyond the age and experience of the authors. The plot may mirror Da Vinci in some respects, and indeed it is absorbing and suspenseful. But the style and depth is more similar to &quot;The Dante Club&quot; by Matthew Pearl.<br /><br /> Set on the campus of Princeton University, &quot;The Rule of Four&quot; tells the story of a pair of young scholars in their pursuit of the riddle of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, a rare and mysterious medieval manuscript of the 15th century. As in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, these modern day sleuths attempt to unlock centuries-old secrets, starting with the identity of the author. Similarly, there is danger involved, as apparently the expectedly docile scholars of medieval literature on Ivy League campuses play for high stakes, including murder. But while Dan Brown?s protagonist jets around the world in search of the truth, Caldwell-Thompson's nerdy young bookworms confine their quest to the musty libraries and underground steam tunnels of Princeton. In exposing the loves, loyalties and friendships of the Princeton students, this is as much a story of coming of age as it is a thriller. Meanwhile, whether unintentional or parody, &quot;The Rule of Four&quot; is a scathing indictment of the self-absorbed and pretentious lives of the Ivy League's rich and privileged brats.<br /><br /> &quot;The Rule of Four&quot; may not be the easiest read, and it certainly won?t enjoy the well-deserved broad appeal of Dan Brown's &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;. But it is definitely worth the effort: in the end this is a thoughtful and thought provoking story which sheds light on an interesting a largely unknown period of European history, while at the same time illuminating America's Ivy League society. Think Umberto Eco rather than Dan Brown, and you?ll enjoy a fresh and unique reading experience.h the effort: in the end this is a thoughtful and thought provoking story which sheds light on an interesting a largely unknown period of European history, while at the same time illuminating America's Ivy League society.

His prose is light, casual, and witty, neither pretentious nor self-important.  Kind of like Rosenfelt's defense lawyer-hero, Andy Carpenter, who stars again in \\"Bury the Lead\\".  Andy is back with the usual cast of supporting characters: girlfriend/PI Laurie Collins, \\"Law-dromat\\" owner and hypochondriac Kevin Randall, and of course Tara, the golden retriever.  \\"Bury\\" is again set in the northern New Jersey suburbs that Rosenfelt knows so well (\\"The Giants and the Jets play football in Jersey, yet they deny its existence, referring to themselves as `New York'\\"). Daniel Cummings, a high profile reporter with some baggage, is chosen by a fiendish serial killer as a conduit to the police, but soon finds himself as the number one suspect.  Carpenter and team are initially reluctant, but eventually are convinced of his innocence and take on Cummings' defense.  What follows is a relatively lightweight plot that, just when starting to stretch and fray around the edges, moves along quickly enough satisfy all but the most critical cases of A.D.D.  There are a couple of twists to hold mild interest, but not so much as to make this a novel you'll remember three months from now.  But Rosenfelt's likeable cast and breezy pace more than compensate any weaknesses in the action, and a surprisingly light tone, despite the rather gruesome subject matter, is a refreshing twist in itself.<br />I suspect that the first-time Rosenfeld reader may find \\"Bury the Lead\\" somewhat more enjoyable than will the Rosenfelt veteran, as the Andy-Laurie-Tara act begins to wear a bit thin on this the third installment.  Nonetheless, \\"Bury the Lead\\" is a credible and entertaining effort, well worth the time. One word of caution: at 272 pages of large print, this is a short read - don't plan on using it for filler on too long a flight.	2004-07-14

In this, the sequel to author William Lashner's debut, \\"Hostile Witness\\", he serves up a surprisingly gothic mystery with all the trimmings: a dark and decrepit mansion - \\"Veritas\\", the wealthy family with secrets that are literally buried, hidden passageways and, of course, murder.  Throw in Lashner's usual cast of south Philly mobsters and other assorted bizarre supporting characters, and this adds up to one engrossing and entertaining read.<br />Philadelphia lawyer Victor Carl has a history defending organized crime.  He is approached by Caroline Shaw, an attractive young woman who, unbeknownst to Carl at the time, is heiress to the \\"Reddman\\" Pickle fortune.  Caroline believes her sister's recent suicide was in fact a mob hit, and that she would be next. Given Car's connections to the underworld, enlists his help.  Reluctant at first, but, envisioning a wrongful death law suit with millions of inheritance at stake, he eventually succumbs to greed and agrees to take the case.  Carl is soon over his head in a delightfully convoluted tale of old money and old murder, deception, greed, and mayhem that span four generations and two continents.  Street smart and self-depreciating, Victor Carl proves he can deal with street thugs and aristocratic bankers with equal ease.  While neither fitting the mold of the competent lawyer of a Grisham novel, and certainly not the physically tough hero of a Lehane or Crais mystery, Carl is nonetheless an endearing and effective narrator.<br />In summary, if you like a spooky old-fashioned thriller mystery with some real skeletons in the closet, engaging characters, intelligent dialog, and don't mind investing some time, (the paperback stretches to 568 pages), \\"Bitter Truth\\" is a highly recommended read.	2004-07-11

While his left-leaning political views don't coincide with my own, I respect the purity of his beliefs, which usually fit within his storyline, embellished by his extraordinary lyrical prose.  Unfortunately \\"In the Moon of Red Ponies\\" is not up to Burke standards.  Instead, &quot;Poines&quot; struck me as a hastily constructed effort put together only to serve as a platform upon which to hang another tired rant of government-industry conspiracy, and yet another opportunity to bash US involvement in the Mid East.<br />This is Burke's fourth novel featuring Billy Bob Holland, lawyer and ex-Texas ranger who has taken up residence in Montana.  Burke succumbs to all the stereotypes: the downtrodden Native American who nonetheless maintains dignity, honor and wisdom despite persecution from the \\"G\\", while evil takes the form of a corrupt US senator and an even more despicable corporate titan.  When not raping and pillaging the Montana environment, our conspirators are scheming more diabolical ways in which to profit from the War in Iraq, while the root of Saddam Hussein's treachery is of course unveiled to ultimately be the fault of the US.  Billy Bob Holland, while a vibrant and imposing character in \\"Bitterroot\\", is flat in \\"Ponies\\", wearing his continual state of indignation on his leather-fringed sleeve.  While Holland shares many characteristics with Burke's Dave Robicheaux, the macho stoicism just doesn't fit a lawyer as it does the Louisiana Bayou-based cop.  The most interesting character is Wyatt Dixon, Holland's vicious adversary from \\"Bitterroot\\".  Dixon has been released from prison on a technicality, returning to settle the score with Holland - or so it appears.<br />Burke's consistently talented writing skills keep &quot;In the Moon of Red Ponies&quot; a notch above more typical left-wing paranoia, but in the end, this convoluted tale of government deception and conspiracy just doesn't cut it.

In fact, if Burke has a flaw, it is that the settings are so dense and powerful that the plot can be, if not lost, at crushed by the atmospheric pressure. Burke writes of southern Louisiana with a mix of pride and frustration, of steamy bayous and rusted car bodies, of antebellum mansions presiding over tin shacks. Lots of pain, precious little joy. Burke's south is a mystical place, where from the swampy mists the ghost of a Confederate soldier is as likely to break as is the sun. He pens his lyrical prose with a fatalism and pathos that only a diehard, but sincere, liberal can master.<br /><br />From this atmosphere, the story of \\"Burning Angel\\" slowly unwinds. Dave Robicheaux, the perpetually haunted and self-suffering cop of backwater Iberia, LA, agrees to help the local po' black folk get to the bottom of a land dispute with the wealthy gentry. (I like Robicheaux's character - he is written with an uncommon depth, sensitivity, passion but also in-your-face toughness - but can anyone remember Robicheaux laughing - ever?) Enter Sonny Boy Marsallus, a seemingly 'common' thug, were it not for his uncommon sense of honor and loyalty. Marsallus has a mysterious past, linked through the Central American jungles to the past of Robicheaux ex-NOPD partner and friend, the inimitable Clete Purcell. The plot is not straightforward, which is OK, as it allows Burke plenty of time to weave in another set of unforgettable supporting characters, heavily weighted towards New Orleans mobsters and cutthroat militant mercenaries. Throw in the lure of Jean Lafitte buried treasure and just a hint of the supernatural, and you'll be hooked on another melancholy and thoroughly entertaining brand of crime fiction that has become a Burke trademark.

In an unapologetic remake of the proven Holmes-Watson formula, Thomas' Holes, Cyrus Barker, takes on as assistant a young and downtrodden Welshman, Thomas Llewelyn.  The enigmatic Barker, an English aristocrat with mystical oriental influences, and the naïve but determined Llewelyn team up to solve the murder and crucifixion of a promising young rabbinical student in London's east-end Jewish ghetto.<br />If you enjoy a bit of history with your fiction, you'll find Thomas' Victorian London well researched and informative. The customs of life within the Jewish community add a unique flavor to the mystery, while contemporary views of race and religion - eugenics - provide a fascinating backdrop.  The actual murder, however, takes a back seat to the novel's setting and culture, and also to the budding friendship between Barker and Llewelyn.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the hardcore murder mystery fan may find the suspects more suited to the game of \\"Clue\\" than to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Nonetheless, \\"Some Danger Involved\\" is an impressive and enjoyable debut, and hopefully the first in a series featuring the Carter-Llewelyn team.	2004-06-26

Aided by television and print media interested more in attracting audiences than in reporting fact, Milloy exposes the less-than-pure motives behind the so-called science, offering a layman's explanation of the tools, techniques, and statistical analysis to determine fact from fraud, and to draw logical conclusions independent of the hype.  While some of the chapters discussing the actual statistical technique may run a bit dry, for the most part this is a quick and entertaining read.  In addition to taking on controversial topics like DDT, PCBs, and dioxin, Milloy debunks popular environmental mega myths including Agent Orange, Love Canal, Cancer Clusters, Three Mile Island, and others.

Before the revisionists have completely twisted the men and women of the America Revolution into their own warped views \\"political correctness\\", it is refreshing to have this tale recorded in McCullough's lucid and moving prose.<br />This is not to say that McCullough deifies Adams or his contemporaries.  Rather, based primarily on the prolific writings of John and Abigail Adams to each other, their family,  friends and associates over the course of more than sixty years, Adams emerges as a tragic hero, the irascible and stubborn patriot whose love of country and liberty ultimately leads to his own political demise.  Unlike so many of our politician's today, Adams emerges as the unselfish leader putting country before political party and personal gain, fully realizing the devastating personal consequences.<br />But \\"John Adams\\" is much more than the biography of the Founding Father sometimes lost in the long shadows cast by Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Hamilton.  Indeed, it is a biography of America, first in breaking free from England, and later in struggling to gain identity and credibility from the arrogance and treachery of the European nations.  McCullough's research goes broad and deep, encapsulating events shaping history on both sides of the Atlantic, often as seen through the eyes of John Adams while serving abroad as minister to both Britain and France, and simultaneously through Abigail's pen as she relates the increasingly desperate situation in America.<br />Given Adams' roles in the Declaration of Independence, the Massachusetts Constitution, in securing recognition and loans from the Netherlands, and in negotiations with Britain ending the Revolutionary War, his election to president is somewhat anticlimactic - seen more as fulfilling a duty than as a coveted prize.  But of keen interest is relationship between Adams and Jefferson, a complex web of friendship and betrayal, of noble cause and of politics at its worst.  The young Jefferson, soft-spoken and mildly introverted, is admired by Adams for the purity of his intellect and reason.  They become friends during the early days of the Continental Congress, where Jefferson emerges as the \\"pen\\" of liberty, while Adams, on the strength of oratory that is more dogged than eloquent, is the \\"voice\\".  But once the Federalist Adams ascends to the presidency, an unenviable task filling the shoes of the beloved George Washington, Republican Jefferson, Adams' vice president, begins sowing the seeds leading to the destruction of his once-friend's political career.  It is ironic that Jefferson, a Virginia aristocrat and slave owner who lived like royalty is popularly viewed as a \\"Man of the People\\", while Adams, a simple farmer who despised slavery, was depicted as a Monarchist who would enslave the common man.  It is interesting that in over two centuries, politics have not evolved above the innuendo and outright lies so prevalent in the political process of today.<br />McCullough's \\"John Adams\\" is far more than a brilliant chronicle John Adams' significant role in the birth of America.  Rather, while the times in which we live may seem troubled, given the challenges and sacrifices of John Adams and his fellow patriots, our issues seem trivial by comparison.  \\"John Adams\\" is a triumph of hope and inspiration, and unvarnished and compelling portrait of America and a great American during a tumultuous and pivotal period in world history.

Leaning on family ties - reluctant Confederate soldier Willie Burke is the author's ancestor - Burke's antebellum south is a dark and somber place, ripe with suffering, death, and inequity.  At its best, it is a compelling portrait of the horrors of our Civil War, capturing in vivid and brutal detail the battles of Shiloh and Shenandoah Valley.  Some will recall Stephen Crane's \\"Red Badge of Courage\\", as young Willie Burke wanders dazed behind enemy lines in search of his unit.  In the carnage of the battlefield, the suffering among the filth, disease, and severed limbs of field hospital charnel houses, the reader will ask, \\"did we really do this to our own countrymen?\\"  At its worst, \\"White Doves at Morning\\" slips into preachy stereotype: the corrupt plantation owner, the noble slave, the evil overseer.  But through it all, Burke tells the story with his own brand of passionate prose, stating his views with power and clarity, while limiting his palette only to shades of gray and black.  Notwithstanding, Burke's characters as always are strongly developed, flawed and vulnerable, and ultimately believable.  \\"White Doves\\" delivers precious little \\"feel good\\" closure and little in the way of redemption, instead shining an all-too bright light on a period of American history most of us would just as soon pretend never happened.  While not a perfect effort, \\"White Doves\\" is a powerful novel, demonstrating Burke's versatility and adding further proof that he is perhaps the most talented living American writer of fiction.	2004-06-13

But it is also an outstanding history of American life in the 18th century, first as a colony, then in the struggle for independence.  The role of France in the American Revolution - and Franklin's role in securing that key alliance - unfolds with a clarity I'd not previously encountered.  And Franklin's often-combative relationship with John Adams is a riveting character study, especially when balanced by McCullough's biography of Adams.  In vivid detail and painstaking research, Isaacson's Franklin is brilliant, but still an enigma.  Despite unquestionably high morality, we see a ruthless businessman.  While possessing an obvious love for socializing - especially with members of the opposite sex - his immediate family is effectively abandoned, as Franklin lives virtually parallel lives between Europe and America.  We see Franklin typically charitable and charming, yet alternately cold and calculating. Yet despite his foibles and flaws, Franklin emerges deservedly as \\"the most accomplished American of his age.\\"  And given the breadth of these accomplishments, an argument could be made \\"for any age\\".  In summary, Isaacson achieves the rare combination of an important and scholarly biography that at the same time is a lively and entertaining story of America and one of our greatest Americans.	2004-06-10

Look, when I read a thriller, I'm not expecting classic literature, but in order to be entertaining, there must be at least some shred of credibility in the story, the characters, or the setting.  In \\"Scarecrow\\", Matthew Reilly simply strings together a series of cliffhangers, each more incredulous than the last.  The plot is a tired theme - a \\"star chamber\\" of evil industrialists - \\"The Majestic 12\\" - which pulls the world's strings, manipulating all commerce and politics; replacing governments at will.  Meanwhile, the indestructible Shane Schofield, while a mere US Marine Captain, romps across the globe in an unrestrained pursuit of justice.  Kind of like Superman in green fatigues.  Schofield, determined by &quot;M12&quot; to be one of only 15 people in the world with reflexes fast enough to foil their evil plot, places a bounty of nearly $20M literally on Shane's head.  Multiple teams of international bounty hunters pursue Schofield and the other fourteen, from Siberia's tundra to France's Normandy coast.  Accompanied by his Marine buddies, his girlfriend, and the bizarre \\"Mother\\" Newman - think of a one-legged Hulk Hogan with a shaved head - but female, our intrepid Captain Schofield evades the bounty hunters and chases the bad guys while saving the world.  In less than a day.<br />A weak plot is excusable, if balanced by interesting characters and engaging dialogue.  Regrettably, against the paper-thin character development and discourse that is more suited to a cartoon bubble, the plot is Shakespearian by comparison.  Interspersed within the silly dialogue and inane action is an outlandish conspiracy that should embarrass even the most diehard black helicopter disciple. To make it worse, Reilly peppers about every-other line with italicized phrases - I guess to convey some sense of wonder in his pedestrian prose.  About the only saving grace was the killing off of some of the annoying good guys in Schofield's entourage along the way.  The irony: this book is so bad that with only some minor tweaks, Reilly could have turned this into an absolutely hilarious parody of thriller/suspense novels.  It is almost bad enough to be funny. Unfortunately, Reilly is dead serious about his subject matter, complete with a sanctimonious closing \\"Interview with Matthew Reilly: The Writing of Scarecrow.\\"<br />In summary, and I realize this will draw the wrath of Reilly's fans, \\"Scarecrow\\" is quite possibly the worse book of the genre I've ever read.  Buy a good comic book instead - much cheaper.as the killing off of some of the annoying good guys in Schofield's entourage along the way.

It is New Year's Day 1990, and it is Major Jack Reacher now, an officer in an elite unit of the military police, recently and abruptly reassigned from Panama to acting Provost Marshall of North Carolina's Fort Bird.  A visiting General is found dead of an apparent heart attack in a sleazy motel with by-the-hour rates.  Not long after that, the same General's wife is found bludgeoned to death in her rural Virginia home, setting the course for an arcane path of treachery reaching the highest levels of the Army.  In the search unravel the mystery, Reacher must deal with deceitful Army bureaucrats and Delta Force commandos out for revenge, while grappling with the imminent death of his ailing mother.<br />\\"The Enemy\\" is more a police mystery than the standard Child suspense/thriller fare, but the results are more than satisfying.  While it lacks some of the force and adrenalin of some of Child's earlier works, it does fill in some of the background on Child's reclusive hero.  We learn much about his French mother, and in her find clues to Reacher's stoic sense of honor and commitment.  Reacher's brother - Joe - is like younger brother Jack in many respects.  Conversations between Jack and Joe are about as animated as Lincoln and Washington chatting on Mt. Rushmore.  The plot - a rather convoluted tale implying high stakes politicking to determine who's on top in the Army following the inevitable post-Berlin War force reductions - is thin and implausible.  But not to worry, for as with all Jack Reacher tales, the plot needs merely to be a passable backdrop in which Reacher can show off his martial and mental talents.  In short, \\"The Enemy\\" is another fast moving installment from Lee Child, sure to please fans of both mystery and suspense genres.	2004-05-31

Yet it is a time often overlooked in the standard history texts, and certainly not well understood by the average American.  In \\"The Devil in the White City\\", author Erik Larson masterfully sheds a bright light on this forgotten era, illuminating late 19th-century Chicago as seen through the eyes of an architect and a serial killer, as unlikely a pair as one could imagine.  One, Daniel H. Burnham, battles bureaucracy, economic recession, time, and nature in a race against time to build the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.  Meanwhile, H.H. Holmes, a fiend of unprecedented evil, is committing acts of unthinkable horror only minutes from Burnham's \\"White City\\" on south Chicago's shores of Lake Michigan.  Larson spins a compelling tale, the rare page-turner that is also history, while causing the reader to ask again and again, \\"Why have I never heard of this before?\\"  Chapters alternate between the trials Burnham faces in completing a task that must surpass Paris's wildly successful World's Fair, symbolized by Eiffel's famous tower built for that event, and the schemes and deceptions of the chameleon Holmes.  Historical figures, notably William \\"Wild Bill\\" Cody, Annie Oakley, Susan B. Anthony, and Jane Addams pass through the pages, adding additional depth and occasional humor.  In stark contrast, H.H. Holmes is building is own secret \\"city\\" - this one of prisons, gas chambers, and crematoriums, leaving behind a path of terror that while far more extensive than that of his contemporary Jack the Ripper, has been strangely forgotten by history.  Proving once again that fact is indeed stranger than fiction, Erik Larson's illuminating history of century-old acts both triumphant and sordid is not to be missed.	2004-05-31

Not the more popular - and more tired - cities of New York, LA, or New Orleans, but South Philly - the setting William Lashner chooses for \\"Past Due\\".  It is a good choice - a city Lashner clearly knows well, and of which he writes with passion and forcefulness on a par with Dennis Lehane's Boston.  A portrait of Lashner's Philadelphia is reflected in the author's photo on the dust jacket: the battered countenance of an ex-boxer, the smug confidence, the ugly red tie reminiscent of that worn by Lashner's lawyer-hero Victor Carl.<br /><br />Victor Carl, like Lashner, is Philadelphia personified.  A blue-collar lawyer, proud but far from rich, street smart but never sophisticated.  In \\"Past Due\\", it is only Carl's loyalty and honor compels him to track down the killer of Joey \\"Cheaps\\" Parma, a marginal mobster and sometimes Carl-client who leaves this life with lots of debts and zero assets.  Carl's investigation takes him back to the 20-year disappearance of Tommy Greeley, uncovering a sordid tale of the usual drugs, thugs, murder, and mayhem, with a Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice thrown in for good measure.  But while the plot may be pedestrian by some standards, the story pummels along from chapter to chapter like a heavy weight bouncing off the ropes, buoyed by the strength of colorful characters playing their parts in seedy bars and tacky mansions from the Schuylkill River to the Black Horse Pike.  The dialogue is realistic, ethnic, sometimes funny, always quick.  \\"Past Due\\" is simply unadorned hard-hitting crime fiction, more Jim Thompson than John Grisham, all grit and little finesse. Is this a novel you'll remember three months from now?  Probably not, but it sure is a lot of fun along the way. Kind of like South Philly.	2004-05-29

The theme - a modern day dating service - could hardly be any less promising as the backdrop for a techno-thriller.  But Child spins a tale with the aplomb of Michael Crichton, while bringing the often terrifying cyber-future of William Gibson to a broader audience.<br />\\"Death Match\\" is the story of Eden, a high-tech match making company whose coupling of singles has extraordinary results - for an extraordinary price of $25,000 per person - launching Eden and reclusive founder Richard Silver to an American icons and Wall Street darlings.  Darlings, that is, until some seemingly well adjusted couples start committing double suicides.  Enter Christopher Lash, former FBI psychologist and profiler with his own baggage, called in by the Eden brass to get a handle on these unlikely suicides.  The ultra-secret, ultra high security Eden must increasingly reveal their matching methods to Lash as another couple dies and the need for damage control escalates.  Child does a masterful job of making an engaging story of arcane psychobabble, complete with actual Rorschach inkblots and IQ tests.  He dives deep into founder Richard Silver's neural-networked supercomputer, the core of Eden's success, as Child unravels the mysteries databases, avatars, and other geek-speak into a who-dunnit even your grandmother would understand and enjoy.  For the \\"black helicopter\\" crowd, there is enough bizarre conspiracy theory and \\"big brother\\" to keep the Internet chat rooms buzzing, while the more skeptical reader can still enjoy Child's fantasy of an industrial-government tryanny with nothing better to do than invade individual privacy.<br />In short, slickly plotted, believable (if thinly developed) characters, and steady action make \\"Death Match\\" the best solo effort I've read of either Child or Preston, and definitely up to par with some of their more popular team efforts.  A good bet for the big screen, this fiction is a frightening as it is imaginative; the perfect read for a lazy day or long flight.g screen, this fiction is a frightening as it is imaginative; the perfect read for a lazy day or long flight.	2004-05-17

This is as refreshingly-far from the armchair generals and TV talking-head analysts as one can get, providing unique insight into what was happening as seen by North while embedded with the Marines as they fought their way from Kuwait to Baghdad to Tikrit in March-April, 2003.  Told in a series of vignettes - \\"sitreps\\" in mil-speak\\" - Retired Marine Colonel North relates the story as he sees it, depending more on the perspective of the enlisted men than of the senior officers of his unit.  North captures the details of day-to-day life in desert, where sacrifices are routine and acts of heroism common and mostly unsung.  He delivers these tales with straight prose and clinical precision, resisting any temptation to sensationalize or to evoke pity.  It is an honest and unvarnished view of the Iraq war, at least as seen through the rather narrow sights of the unit with which North traveled.  (In fact, as North notes frequently, he and he troops on the ground had scant insight to the progress of the war in the \\"big picture\\".  An occasional opportunity to catch a Fox News transmission were their best sources of intelligence).<br />It is unfortunate that some will dismiss or disparage this fine documentary simply because they disagree with Oliver North's political views.  I happen to believe that Colonel North is an inspiration and a great American, but notwithstanding, \\"War Stories\\" is a powerful first-hand portrayal of one of the most important historical events of our time.  If not for North, then read it as a tribute to our young volunteer armed forces who have sacrificed so much.	2004-05-09

Testosterone runs high, larger-than-life bad guys take evil to new depths, cliffhangers that would embarrass Indiana Jones.  And if there is such a thing as a literary equivalent of film's slow-motion action scenes, then Lee Child is the master.  Guns don't simply shoot a bullet; Child talks muzzle velocities, projectile weights, gun barrel chemistry, and the physics of 0.5-inch diameter bullet fired from a Barrett sniper rifle passing through skull and brain.  All very violent, and all very entertaining.<br />\\"Die Trying\\" is Lee Child's second Jack Reacher novel, and there is no sophomore jinx.  Reacher, ex-military cop and veritable walking encyclopedia of all armament, happens on the wrong place at the wrong time in downtown Chicago, finding himself unwittingly in the middle of a kidnapping.  The victim: Holly Johnson, a beautiful and brainy FBI agent, but, as it turns out, much, much more.  The perps: a band of neo-fascist wacko's - think Waco or Ruby Ridge - about to hatch a plot to declare independence and secede from the United States.  Meanwhile, everybody from the FBI to the US Marines tries to find and free Holly, while Reacher works on the inside - as a co-hostage - fights to protect Holly's honor, chastity, and life.  Child paints a wonderfully diabolically twisted Beau Borkin as the leader of the cult, and a rather fascinating picture of life inside an extreme right-wing conspiracy.  Bottom line: not a novel you'll be retelling to the grandkids, and no literary milestone, but few can verbalize raw power better than Lee Child.  A great page-turner, a great diversion, pure entertainment.	2004-05-09

While walking down the streets of Boston, Reacher bumps into a \\"ghost\\" from his past - Quinn - a man who Reacher thought he had killed a decade prior.  Through a license plate, Reacher traces Quinn to Zachary Beck, a suspected heavy in the drug trade.  Reacher teams up with DEA agent Susan Duffy, who is heading an \\"off-the-books\\" sting of Beck in an attempt to free one of Duffy's agents who had infiltrated Beck's operation, but was found-out.  In concert with the DEA, a kidnapping of Beck's college-student son Richard is staged.  Reacher plays the \\"hero\\", rescuing Richard and, in the events that follow,  gets inside the reclusive Beck's illicit business.  Reacher gains Beck's trust and, through a couple of convenient \\"accidents\\", is given a security job to fill the unplanned vacancies.  Woven through the story through a series of flashbacks is the tale of the sadistic Quinn, gradually unveiling the root of Reacher's vengeance.<br />Child writes with razor sharp efficiency and clarity: a tight plot with no pretense of embellishment beyond the requisite violence and mayhem.  Child's Reacher is the ultimate stoic loaner - Clint Eastwood's \\"man without a name\\" in a modern setting where the villains are meaner and the guns a lot bigger.  Child writes with a clear and unambiguous sense of right and wrong, of good and evil.  And while Reacher runs no risk on canonization, the bad guys are so devoid of any redeeming social value that the contrast is crystal clear.  \\"Persuader\\" is high adrenalin fiction without excuse: blunt, brutal, and suspenseful: a true page-turner and the ultimate summer read.	2004-05-02

David Rosenfelt's second novel, \\"First Degree\\", pretty much picks up where his highly acclaimed and immensely enjoyable debut, \\"Open and Shut\\", left off.  Back is wise-cracking defense attorney Andy Carpenter,  \\"Law-dromat\\" lawyer Kevin Randall, investigator/girlfriend Laurie Collins, and of course Tara, Carpenter's golden retriever.  Even Willie Miller, the death-row inmate Carpenter defends in his first book, is back starring in a mostly unnecessary sub-plot.  But if you enjoyed \\"Open and Shut\\", you'll certainly find the pace, style, and settings of \\"First Degree\\" comfortable.  So comfortable, in fact, that reading \\"Open and Shut\\" is almost prerequisite, at least if you want to have any clue to the source Carpenter's mysterious inheritance and the imprisonment of his Senator ex-father-in-law which are frequently referenced in the new story.<br />\\"First Degree\\" gets off to a fast start with the gruesome discovery of the headless and charred body of Alex Dorsey, a Patterson police lieutenant with a shady history.  Shortly after the murder, a mysterious visitor shows up in Andy's office, confesses to being Dorsey's killer and, in the process, drops some clues regarding the murder that only those responsible for the crime would know.  This leads to a series of events that ends in the arrest of Laurie Collins for the murder of Dorsey.  Laurie indeed may have a motive: as a former Patterson cop, she blew the whistle on Dorsey's unsavory activities, but was unsuccessful in making the charges stick.  With Laurie now in the hot seat, Andy and Kevin team up again, defending her against what appears to be a carefully concocted frame job.  What follows is some compelling courtroom drama, spiced Andy's bizarre but now-legendary defense antics, paced with a satisfying blend of humor and cynicism.  It is a well crafted who-dun-nit, with enough suspense and thrills to keep the pages turning.  Like \\"Open and Shut\\", this is fast reading, and the sheer adrenalin will keep many reading cover-to-cover in a single setting.  My only real criticism of \\"First Degree\\" is the ending. The book could have ended very successfully on page 224.  Instead, Rosenfelt adds another seven pages - I guess he felt the need for one more twist - that falls flat in a wholly unbelievable &quot;second&quot; climax that was not only unnecessary, but casts a pall over an otherwise terrific story.

Andy's father, retired DA Nelson Carpenter, asks Andy to consider the retrial of a death-row inmate Willie Miller.  Andy considers this a strange request, since Miller's was an open-and-shut case: incontrovertible physical evidence, a credible eyewitness.  Why would his father - who personally prosecuted the case seven years ago - be so interested in having his son represent Miller on a on a retrial initiated not by new evidence, but by a technicality?  But shortly after this request, Nelson drops dead while watching a ball game with Andy at Yankee Stadium, eventually leading Andy to the discovery of a 35-year-old mystery involving Andy's father and his powerful friends.<br />David Rosenfelt's first novel, \\"Open and Shut\\", is engaging and lively fiction; a well crafted legal thriller.  As Andy goes about the business of settling his dad's affairs, he learns that he is suddenly a multi-millionaire, the heir of a secret fortune his father had hidden away.  As he delves into Willie's murder retrial, a pattern of conspiracy unfolds, and the connection between Andy's father's past and the conviction of Miller starts to crystallize.  Protagonist Andy Carpenter is an easy character to like - a self-depreciating wise-cracker whose courtroom stunts add a unique twist to more standard legal fare.  The dialogue is peppy and, if a bit over-the-top in credibility, it is nonetheless entertaining.  The supporting cast of characters lacks the depth and interest of those of contemporary authors Dennis Lehane, Robert Crais, or James Lee Burke, but the imaginative plot, quick pace, and sense of humor more than compensate for this shortcoming.<br />Bottom line: a well-executed and impressive first effort - the perfect read for a coast-to-coast flight.

His book traces the story of Joshua Maxfield, a serial killer who has left Van Meter's twin sister, Casey, in a coma with little hope of recovery.  Through a series of flashbacks, Van Meter's story intertwines with that of talented teenager Ashley Spencer, whose family and best friend were also brutally murdered by the heinous Maxfield.  While \\"Beauty\\" gets off to a promising start, it soon loses its way, sidetracked by cardboard characters, inane dialogue, and uninspired prose.  Also, an unnecessary and sappy romance is distracting and unnecessary. A successful novel captures the fine balance between the plot that is startling and unpredictable, but also believable.  Margolin tries hard to achieve the former, but ultimately misses the latter.  And regarding the \\"shocking ending\\", even the dust cover summary portends the conclusion.  Bottom line: Margolin can do better; I'd skip this one, or at least wait for the paperback and the beach.  Consider Lashner's \\"Fatal Flaw\\" as a more interesting alternative.	2004-04-22

As with his previous works of English history (\\"Sarum\\", \\"London\\", and \\"The Forest\\"), \\"Princes\\" is obviously a labor of love.  Painstakingly researched and rich in historical detail, in this latest effort Rutherfurd takes the reader through eleven centuries of Irish history, starting in the 5th century AD, passing through St. Patrick, the Norse invasions, and English rule, ending during King Henry VIII's impact on Ireland's destiny.  The formula will be familiar to Rutherford fans: a number of fictitious family lines are traced through a series of vignettes, connected generation-to-generation, resulting in an exceptionably pleasurable and meaningful passage through history.  Rutherfurd brings otherwise dry historical events vividly to life: tales of druids and monks, of politics and passion, of armored knights and axe-wielding Vikings, of deeds of nobility and treachery.  Admittedly, this is not light reading.  At nearly 800 pages, there are some tedious passages to plow through, as well as the need for frequent referrals to the genealogy to keep track of the various clans and places through the ages.  \\"Princes\\" may lack some of the passion and poignancy of Rutherfurd's \\"Sarum\\", and some of the irony and more familiar historical context of \\"London\\".  But nonetheless, this is a powerful and informative work of fiction, highly recommended for the reader who prefers some education with the entertainment.  I'll be anxiously awaiting the second volume.	2004-04-18

Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker, the ex-NYPD private investigator of Connolly's previous three novels (Every Dead Thing, The Killing Kind, The White Road) is \\"mostly\\" missing.  (Parker, in an unusual twist for a novel, does indeed make a cameo appearance in \\"Bad Men\\".)  But this is a departure of other sorts.  Missing also in \\"Men\\" is the depth of Connolly's typically haunting prose - the lyrical quality of his previous works that made him so unique in the crowded field of popular crime fiction.  But that in no way implies that \\"Bad Men\\" is a pedestrian effort.  To the contrary, this is gripping fiction - a self-described thriller that is also a mystery - while at the same time a tale of the supernatural that rivals the master, Stephen King.<br />The story takes place on the isolated Sanctuary Island off the coast of Portland, Maine - familiar territory for the Charlie Parker (or King) fan.  Against the backdrop of a brutal massacre of the island's original settlers three centuries before, Connolly paints a fascinating story of King-like contrast: the boredom of rural Maine meets unspeakable evils, ancient and contemporary.  While the characters may fall a bit sort of Connolly's vivid portraits in the \\"Parker\\" series, they are nonetheless interesting: the island's chief of police, Joe Dupree, is literally a giant, and an entire entourage of \\"bad men\\" (one bad woman) that make Peckinpah's \\"Wild Bunch\\" look like a Sunday School class.  At the center of the storm are convicted felon Edward Moloch, whose Biblically inspired name foreshadows, and his estranged wife, hiding out on Sanctuary Island under the assumed name of Marianne Elliott.  Five years prior, Marianne, in protecting herself and her infant son, had betrayed Moloch to the police, taken money that he had stolen, and fled under a false identity.  After a particularly brutal escape from prison, Moloch assembles his team of despots and seeks out to find Marianne and reap his vengeance.  As Moloch's gang tracks down the unsuspecting Elliott, they inevitably encounter \\"Melancholy\\" Joe Dupree.  But as Moloch's boys find mistrust and jealously within the team a more formidable obstacle, the malevolent force lurking within the island emerges as the true deterrent.<br />While perhaps lacking the passion and force of Connolly's previous words, \\"Bad Men\\" is a wholly enjoyable and engrossing work of fiction, sure to hold the reader's attention.  Thriller, mystery, horror - take your pick - Connolly does it all in this one with highly satisfying results.ianne and reap his vengeance.

Victor Carl, a lawyer, finds his friend, Guy Forrest, also a lawyer, sitting naked outside the house of his friend's murdered girlfriend, Hailey Prouix, who of course is (or was) also a lawyer.  Got that?  But wait - there's more.  It turns out that old Vic was also sleeping with Hailey, and he agrees to represent prime-supect Guy in his defense as Hailey's murderer.  As Guy's lawyer, Vic figures, he can make sure that Guy, who maintains an improbable innocence, pays his due for the murder of Vic's also-girlfriend Hailey.  Convoluted?  You bet.  But nonetheless, this is one terrific read.  And not simply because the plot's main characters are all lawyers who are either 1) dead, 2) in jail awaiting trial, or 3) twisting the law for personal gain.<br />William Lashner - think Grisham without the cornpone.  Or the street smarts and grit of &quot;Mystic River&quot;(s) Dennis Lehane with the courtroom realism of Scott Turow.  Lashner's \\"Fatal Flaw\\" is a compulsive tale of love, betrayal, murder, and mayhem wrapped around a good old-fashioned who-dunnit and a compelling courtroom drama.  This guy is the real deal: sharp dialogue, interesting and believing characters, well-drawn settings, an intriguing storyline.  Lashner's Hailey Prouix, while dead from the first page, emerges through the memories of those still living as one witchy woman, able to reduce a man to a sniveling pile of desire with a mere bump of the knee.  Lashner takes us on a journey through time and place, from Philadelphia's home of the affair and murder, to the Las Vegas strip, to the hills of West Virginia in an investigation that will reach back into the hills of Hailey's childhood.  And the deeper Carl digs, the more his certainty fades, as a murky tale of old murder and dark secrets unfolds. Vic Carl is an engaging and believable protagonist backed by a dependable supporting cast, most notably Philadelphia Main Line Detective Breger and private investigator Phil Skink, the human metaphor of a blunt instrument.  While the reader will likely figure out the end game well into the last third of the book, expect no diminishing enthusiasm in reaching the payoff.  The reader is held helpless in Lashner's vicelock grip to the last word.<br />If you're looking for a real page turner - a fresh and exciting take on the overdone legal drama - look no further.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed - Arvin offers little in this muddled tale that can be recommended.<br />Set in Atlanta, it is the story of Jack Hammond, a once-promising young attorney down on his luck after sleeping with the wrong woman.  Now, as an independent defense attorney, Hammond is barely getting by living on the cases of those who can only afford a court-appointed public defender.  Hammond is drawn into the apparent but suspicious drug-induced suicide of a former best friend and computer whiz, Doug Townsend.  Hammond learns that the nerdy and destitute Townsend was infatuated, and perhaps even romantically involved, with Michelle Sonnier, a breath-takingly beautiful and wildly successful diva of the Atlanta opera.  But Michelle has a past, and she is also the wife of a hugely popular and ultra-rich CEO of Horizn. Horizn, an Atlanta pharmaceutical upstart, is in the closing days of a much anticipated IPO.  Predictably, Hammond finds himself drawn to the magnetic charm and beauty of Sonnier, and in the process manages to attract the attention of a number of unsavory characters from the Atlanta drug trade and the stereotypically-evil corporate America, in this case Horizn.<br />The plot, while implausible, is no more so than much of today's popular fiction.  For sure a more talented author could have pulled it off with the same material.  But Arvin's dialog is silly, and while the pace drags interminably for long stretches, it is not time effectively used to inspire any empathy for the characters from the reader.  For those who appreciate technical accuracy in their reading, Arvin's knowledge of IPO's and the public market was abysmal (\\"Horizn is going public today.  We're going to buy it as high as we can, and sell it short.\\")  But among the many flaws of Arvin's \\"Last Goodbye\\", most prevalent is the breadth and incongruity of issues and messages that continously assault the reader.  That is, rather than simply concentrating on thriller for entertainment value, Arvin clutters the story with unnecessary and clich&eacute;d sermons regarding race, corporate excess, honor, and virtue.  Neither the story nor the thinly developed characters provide the substance to support such weighty issues and, by the end, the story collapses in one of the most maudlin and melodramatically silly endings since James Paterson's abominable \\"1st to Die\\".<br />Trust me, this is no \\"DaVinci Code\\", nor is it remotely on par with Grisham's vintage thrillers.

US	52172447	R3K9UPYUOSNXO3	0312319142	298733702	Paranoia	Books	5	7	10	N	Y	The Real Deal	If you have a life planned for the next seven hours of so, DO NOT pick up Joseph Finder's \\"Paranoia\\".  This is truly a page-turner on caliber with Grisham's \\"The Firm\\" - a high adrenalin corporate thriller that is credible as much as it is pure entertainment.  \\"Paranoia\\" is the story of Adam Cassidy, a 20-something slacker working in the fictional Wyatt Telecom.  After impersonating a company officer and hacking the corporate network to stage a lavish retirement party for a loading dock worker, Cassidy is caught and is given a choice: criminal prosecution which will certainly lead to a long prison term, or work for Wyatt founder/CEO Nick Wyatt - loosely modeled, it seems, after Oracle's Larry Ellison - as a spy inside Wyatt arch rival Trion Systems. As a Trion employee, Cassidy for the first time is productive and flourishes in his new surroundings.  He also begins to develop loyalties to the new company and to Trion's immensely popular folk-hero CEO, \\"Jock\\" Goddard.  Inevitably, he is torn between the forced servitude/espionage of the arrogant and evil Wyatt and allegiance to father figure Goddard (sharing some characteristics with Intel's Andy Grove).<br />The result is a well-paced thriller, with crisp dialog and a tight, unencumbered plot.  Finder has researched his topic well, capturing the politics of corporate America and getting it right on the technological details as well.  Expect some twists along the way, which Finder sets up with subtle hints leading to a clever and satisfying climax.  I found Reed Arvin's recently released and critically acclaimed \\"The Last Goodbye\\" muddled and sloppy in comparison to \\"Paranoia\\".  Not since \\"DaVinci Code\\" have I had such a nard time putting down a novel - &quot;Paranoia&quot; is worth your investment!	2004-03-18
US	52172447	R1DT9EMBC1WFT	0385510438	817294609	The Last Juror (Grisham, John)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Grisham's Still Water Runs Deep	\\"The Last Juror\\" is neither \\"The Firm\\" nor \\"the Pelican Brief\\", nor is it similar to \\"A Time for Killing\\" which shares &quot;Juror's&quot; Ford County, Mississippi, setting.  But it is a powerful novel in its own right, combining the elements of classic Grisham courtroom drama with a nostalgic study of life in rural Mississippi.  The main story is of the brutal rape and murder of a young widow.  The alleged murderer, Danny Padgitt, is the youngest son of the wealthy but reclusive local gentry.  Protagonist Willie Traynor, Memphis-born and Syracuse-educated, migrates to Clanton and, with the help of a rich aunt, buys the dying local newspaper.  So while the story is ostensibly one of the crime and subsequent retribution, it is also a poignant tale of the decade-long relationship that develops between Traynor and \\"Miss\\" Callie Ruffin, matriarch of a poor but proud black family of Clanton.  Just as the Big Brown River and its creeks and sloughs wind through the meadows of Ford County, Grisham's prose meanders through sub-plots, anecdotes and banalities of the small-town south.  Grisham is in no hurry to get to the climax  - indeed the recipe for Miss Callie's pot roast is hardly a page-turner.  But the pace of the prose is a conscious and necessary element of the author's message, and seemingly unconnected events eventually tie together to complete the portrait of Grisham's South.  And if the weighty topics of civil rights and Viet Nam are axes Grisham chooses to grind, he treats them with sensitivity and respect, and is neither heavy-handed nor judgmental in his delivery.<br />The reader looking for a thriller along the lines of Grisham's fine earlier works may be disappointed, but it would be vastly unfair to dismiss this novel.  \\"The Last Juror\\" is thoughtful and thought provoking literature; an example of a fine American story teller broadening his scope and delving deeper into familiar topics.	2004-03-13

But after successive reads of Lincoln Child's \\"Utopia\\", and Douglas Preston's \\"The Codex\\", it's becoming clear that these two do much better as a team than when going solo.  While \\"Utopia\\" had its moments (and even gets a cameo in \\"Codex\\"!), Preston's implausible \\"Codex\\" falls short on virtually all counts.<br />In a nutshell, \\"Codex\\" is the story of an eccentric father, who, dying of cancer, decides to bury with him a fortune in rare art he has collected over a lifetime.  The catch is that his choice of a burial spot in his secret, leaving it to his three insufferable sons to locate and claim their inheritance.  It goes downhill from there.  The brothers are chronically whining about the injustice of \\"father's\\" scheme, while reminding the reader every page or so what a rotten childhood they had.  About the time this banal sibling chatter becomes unbearable, Preston subjects the reader to a steady stream pidgin English from one of the natives in the jungle in which the boys inevitably end up (\\"Thankee, brother.  We talkee later\\".  I'm not making this up).  Preston throws in the standard love interest - blond, brainy, handy with a horse and rifle, and initially while hard to get, there are no surprises to where this \\"Laura Croft\\" will end up.  Stashed away with \\"father's\\" treasure is the lost Mayan Codex, the document that will unlock the mysteries behind all diseases human.  Right.  So while the boys and girl are running around the Central American jungles looking for the lost tomb and its Codex, the stereotypical evil CEO - in the case from a pharmaceutical giant - has his even more evil henchman chasing them through the swamps.  In summary, a silly plot, cardboard characters that still manage to annoy, and lame dialogue, and a predictable ending add up to a pretty disappointing read.  Skip this one, and save your time and money for (hopefully) a rebound when Preston and Childs team up again for this summer's \\"Brimstone\\".	2004-03-09

Too bad, and surely enough to infuriate me often enough while reading \\"Absolute Friends\\". But despite the anti-American rhetoric in LeCarre's latest work, he is still by far the most convincing and accomplished spy-writer of our times and, as \\"Friends\\" is proof, still capable of spinning an engrossing and thought-provoking tale.<br /><br />\\"Friends\\" traces the lives of two aging radicals, very different in their backgrounds but very much the same in their commitment to all causes counter-establishment. Ted Mundy, Pakistan-born ex-pat son of a patriotic but delusional British Army major, is barely making it in modern day Germany as a tour guide.  Living with a former Turkish prostitute common law wife and her son, Mundy flirts with Islam while maintaining his British roots but, paradoxically, still showing glimpses of apologetic pride in his British heritage.  The \\"absolute friend\\", Sasha, is an unrepentant and idealistic German radical for life.  LeCarre takes the reader back to late-60's Berlin, where Mundy and Sasha meet as students, forging a friendship based in anti-establishment and anti-war idealism.  Fast-forward a decade, where we find Mundy and Sasha drones of the very bureaucracies they once despised. Mundy serves as a British Council official dealing with cultural exchanges to Eastern Europe, while Sasha holds a position in the East German Communist regime.  Disillusioned by the differences between the communism of theory and the Communism of the Soviet Bloc, Sasha begins spying on the Eastern Bloc for the west.  Naturally, Mundy becomes his contact, passing Sasha's stolen secrets on to British intelligence while spreading western disinformation back to the Soviets through Sasha.  Following the end of the Cold War, Mundy and Sasha part ways again, only to be drawn back together by Sasha's contact with the mysterious \\"Demetri\\", supposedly a wealthy industrialist hoping to repent for the riches he has earned by re-stoking radical sparks still burning, especially in Sasha.<br /><br />This is an ambitious effort, even for the veteran spymaster LeCarre.  \\"Friends\\" spans nearly four decades of life inside the activist movement, as well as within LeCarre's familiar territory of Cold War espionage.  As always, LeCarre's characters are painstakingly developed and all too real in their shortcomings and foibles - expect no \\"James Bonds\\" in LeCarre fiction.  Plots are so well constructed that at times almost bog down in the detail, but some tedium is a small price for a well-tuned conclusion.  The payoff may frustrate conservatives, while delighting the conspiracy buff or those more liberal-leaning readers.  But regardless of your political views, \\"Absolute Friends\\" is a well crafted, thought-provoking window into the events of the past forty years.  In the final analysis, you shouldn't have to believe in the plausibility of a conspiracy or the political slant of the author to enjoy the journey and appreciate a fine writer's mastery of the topic.again, only to be drawn back together by Sasha's contact with the mysterious \\"Demetri\\", supposedly a wealthy industrialist hoping to repent for the riches he has earned by re-stoking radical sparks still burning, especially in Sasha.

This was my first read of Child going solo, and while perhaps not up to the standards of the duo, &quot;Utopia&quot; will certainly not disappoint.<br />Set in Utopia, a futuristic theme park under a massive dome in the Nevada dessert, our unlikely hero, Dr. Andrew Warne, is a robotics designer and former professor from Carnegie Mellon.  Summoned to Utopia to help solve apparent bugs in the extraordinary advanced and complex systems network he has created, Warne soon finds himself caught up in a terrorist plot in which the park's 65,000 visitors are unknowing hostages.  There is nothing special or endearing in the characters - no &quot;special agent Pendergasts&quot; in this Child installment - though &quot;Utopia&quot; has more than its fill of suspense and adrenalin, and the right balance of technology between credibility and tedium.  But while reading &quot;Utopia&quot;, it is impossible not to recall &quot;Die Hard&quot; - the impossibly urbane chief villain, the accidental hero, the sinister scheme a mere diversion to the ultimate objective, the peril in which the protagonist's loved ones are placed.  While this is not necessarily a bad thing, the familiarity of the plot and predictability of the ending prevent Utopia from earning a four or five star rating.  Notwithstanding, this is an entertaining thriller, and a fascinating glimpse into the complex behind-the-scenes operations of a major theme park.  It is quite evident that Child likely spent considerable time in the Disney World underground as preparation for Utopia.  Preston/Child fans will find this comfortable ground, while the uninitiated can expect in &quot;Utopia&quot; a journey right up there with some of Michael Crichton's better techno-thrillers..	2004-01-22

His words create a powerful image of the Louisiana bayou - an image that is not merely visual, but also capturing the humidity of the swamps, the grit of the cities, the smells of Cajun cooking.  With Burke, you can always count on richly developed characters, moving alternatively between acts of nobility and brutality.  And in all of Burke's works, there is a strong sense of societal divide, of racial tension, of Cajun culture, sensibility, sometimes and depravity.  It is with a dark pallet that Burke paints his stories, and the results are consistently mesmerizing, addictive.  Often, however, the plot and storyline must take a back seat, overpowered by the strength of settings and the casts of James Lee Burke's remarkable writing.<br />Not so with \\"Last Car to Elysian Fields\\".  This is a mighty novel in all respects: a captivating and complex plot, set in the sleazy back alleys of New Orleans, a barbarous Louisiana prison work gang, the familiar backwaters of New Iberia.  Think \\"Mystic River\\" with a Cajun accent.  Our hero Dave Robicheaux is back, but haunted by the recent death of his wife, Bootsie.  Clete Purcel, Robicheaux's one-time NOPD partner is also back, and while Purcel has always been reckless, outrageous, and irreverent, he is truly at home as the master of mayhem in this latest yarn.  In a nutshell, a seemingly unrelated series of events, starting with the decades-earlier suspected murder of a black convict, to the highway death of New Iberia teenagers, a drive-up Daiquiri bar, and mob hit man, are welded together in a gripping tale of bigotry, greed, and corruption in the Deep South.<br />Burke is certainly at the top of the pile of modern crime writers, and \\"Elysian Fields\\" is an example of Burke at the top of his game.  Dark, crude, and ruthless, but at the same time additive and impossible to forget.  Don't let this one pass unread.	2004-01-06

From the remarkable story of the shadowy operations of the US Army's \\"tunnel rats\\" in Viet Nam, to the Bosnia and Kosovo wars, and finally the overlooked jungles of northern South America, Forsyth tells the story of Cal Dexter, a protagonist with a much more interesting vocation than the small town attorney he seems to be.<br />As in the best of Forsyth's works, AVENGER uses historical facts and actual events as the backdrop for compelling fiction.  In this case, Dexter, a freelance contract bounty hunter, is tasked with tracking down a Serbian thug suspected of the brutal murder of a young America volunteer in Bosnia.  It is remarkable how easily Forsyth is able to unravel complexities of the breakdown of the former Yugoslavian state, weaving the ethic and religious tensions into the factional storyline.  Ditto for the flashback to Viet Nam, as the terrifying missions of young Dexter's days as a \\"tunnel rat\\" come full circle to mesh with the conclusion.  Others have noted that AVENGER is no DAY OF THE JACKAL, but while AVENGER may lack the depth of political intrigue of JACKAL, it compensates in adrenalin and nearly constant action.  For the reader who prefers a bit of education with their adventure, AVENGER is not to be missed.	2003-11-01

First, this is a story of Ireland, written by Hart, an American from the Midwest, as well as a first novel.  The pastoral Irish moor provides the backdrop for the teaming Cormac Maguire, a brawny/brainy Irish archeologist, and Nora Gavin, equally eligible American pathologist, providing all the necessary ingredients for a breathless \\"Harlequinesque\\" romance.  Fortunately, my fears could not have been further off the mark.  Rather, Hart demonstrates remarkable talents as a storyteller, lyricist, and historian in this unusual and captivating mystery.  <br />While in the bog cutting turf for fuel, farmers find the severed head of an ancient red-haired girl, perfectly preserved in the damp, dark peat.  Meanwhile, Mina Osborne, wife of local gentry High Osborne, and her toddler son have been missing for over two years. Husband/father Hugh is the prime suspect, but there are neither bodies nor solid evidence to convict him.  Hart moves deftly between the twin plots of solving the circumstances behind the apparent execution of the red-haired girl centuries before, and those of the disappearance and apparent murder of the Osbornes.   The author does a great job of capturing the culture and landscape of rural Ireland, building credible characters in believable situations.  The rainy bogs and dark, decaying manors of central Ireland lend a spooky, gothic, air to the tale, which twists to a mostly unexpected and cleverly conceived conclusion.<br /> \\"Haunted Ground\\" is a well researched, well written, and refreshing change of pace from the more-standard mystery fare.  I would suspect that fans of Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child and Dan Brown would appreciate the history and science Hart blends with her fiction.  I would also recommend Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Rose\\".  In summary, a very impressive debut - I'll look forward to reading more from Erin Hart.	2003-08-03

As with all Preston/Child fare, \\"Still Life\\" is meticulously researched and carefully crafted, painting a vivid word picture of scenes, settings, characters, and moods.  But most notable in this novel is the continued development of FBI Special Agent Pentergast.  In the mysterious and impossibly erudite Pentergast, Preston/Child have created a character unlike any in popular fiction.  There seems to be no bounds to his knowledge and skills - and eccentricity - yet despite the implausibility, Pentergast makes one compelling - even addictive - protagonist.  Part of this is due, I believe, to the authors' skillful - if frustrating - and frugal dissemination of information about Pentergast and his background.  Introduced in \\"Relic\\", where he played an important but essentially secondary role, Agent Pentergast is seen again in \\"Reliquary\\", and more recently in \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\", with each installment revealing slightly more about this complex character.<br />In \\"Still Life\\", Pentergast for the first time shares center stage with no one. Set in rural Kansas, the story has the dark mood and oppressive atmosphere of the best of Stephen King, with a eerie similarity to Thomas Tryon's classic \\"Harvest Home.\\"  After the mutilated corpse of a stranger is found in a bizarre display in a corn filed, Pentergast arrives on the scene uninvited and take up residence in the local boarding house.  From there, town residents begin to disappear, and it is clear that a serial killer is on the prowel in the normally sleepy village.  The storyline is interfused with legends of a haunted Indian burial ground nearby, and the factual massacre of a group of white mercenaries - the \\"Forty-fives\\" - more than a century in the past.  Through the caves and cornfields of Kansas, Pentergast tracks down the mystery and the killer with the unlikely assistance of a local teenage loner.<br />\\"Still Lives with Crows\\" is vintage Preston/Child, with intelligent storylines carefully crafted, engaging characters, and page-turning intensity.  Definitely the top of the genre, and not to be missed.mystery and the killer with the unlikely assistance of a local teenage loner.  <br />\\"Still Lives with Crows\\" is vintage Preston/Child, with intelligent storylines carefully crafted, engaging characters, and page-turning intensity.

First, this is a story of Ireland, written by Hart, an American from the Midwest, as well as a first novel.  The pastoral Irish moor provides the backdrop for the teaming Cormac Maguire, a brawny/brainy Irish archeologist, and Nora Gavin, equally eligible American pathologist, providing all the necessary ingredients for a breathless \\"Harlequinesque\\" romance.  Fortunately, my fears could not have been further off the mark.  Rather, Hart demonstrates remarkable talents as a storyteller, lyricist, and historian in this unusual and captivating mystery.<br />While in the bog cutting turf for fuel, farmers find the severed head of an ancient red-haired girl, perfectly preserved in the damp, dark peat.  Meanwhile, Mina Osborne, wife of local gentry High Osborne, and her toddler son have been missing for over two years. Husband/father Hugh is the prime suspect, but there are neither bodies nor solid evidence to convict him.  Hart moves deftly between the twin plots of solving the circumstances behind the apparent execution of the red-haired girl centuries before, and those of the disappearance and apparent murder of the Osbornes.  The author does a great job of capturing the culture and landscape of rural Ireland, building credible characters in believable situations.  The rainy bogs and dark, decaying manors of central Ireland lend a spooky, gothic, air to the tale, which twists to a mostly unexpected and cleverly conceived conclusion.<br /> \\"Haunted Ground\\" is a well researched, well written, and refreshing change of pace from the more-standard mystery fare.  I would suspect that fans of Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child and Dan Brown would appreciate the history and science Hart blends with her fiction.  I would also recommend Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Rose\\".  In summary, a very impressive debut - I'll look forward to reading more from Erin Hart.	2003-08-03

Hayes, a try.  The story takes place over a 24-hour span in rural Buffalo Springs, Kansas.  The body of an infant has been discovered at the local nursing home, setting the stage for some darkly humorous crime fiction that if not exactly a page-turner is at least unique.  Hayes' laconic and droll style fits neatly with the prairie and small towns of which he writes.  The main characters - part Cheyenne Harvey Edward Maddox, or more popularly \\"Mad Dog\\" and his half brother, the County Sheriff English, or of course \\"Englishman\\" - plow through a 100-year blizzard as the mystery unravels.<br />This is nothing if not a quirky novel - a unique change of pace that will stay lodged in your memory longer than the average crime story.  One gets the feeling that Hayes really enjoys his writing, and as a Kansas native, he certainly seems to know of the people and places around which the tale is spun.  If you're in the mood for some off-beat fiction on a lazy summer afternoon, \\"Prairie Gothic\\" is worth the time.	2003-07-13

Russian reports of the cause of the accident were vague and sometimes contradictory at the time.  Was it collision with an American submarine, as the Russian's subtly implied, or perhaps caused by an onboard accident?  The would only begin trickling out several months after the tragedy.<br />In \\"A Time to Die: The Untold Story of the Kursk Tragedy\\", British author Robert Moore unfolds these facts in a dramatic and compelling fashion.  This well-researched book in rich in detail yet moves at the pace of a fictional thriller.  This tale of heroism and sacrifice on-board is also a scathing indictment of the incompetence and secrecy of the Russian politico-military bureaucracy.  While 88 of the crew were most certainly killed instantly, at least 23 survived for several days after the accident, waiting in vain for rescue while the Russian's tried to manipulate world opinion and Vladimir Putin vacationed on the Black Sea.  As survivors were struggling to stay alive, Russian bureaucrats on shore hesitated and thwarted viable rescue attempts.  Paranoia prevented the willing intervention of western assistance that most certainly could have saved the lives of many of the crewmembers that survived the on-board explosions of torpedoes while still in their tubes.<br />One does not need to be military aficionado to enjoy the fast-paced, well written \\"A Time to Die\\".  It is an important historical milestone, exposing the struggles faced by Russia in the post-Soviet Union period, and an insightful dissection of Russia's secrecy and mistrust of the west.	2003-07-13

Michael Crichton's \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Prey\\", and \\"Timeline\\" are good examples of plausible, if improbable, science effectively used as the basis for high-adrenalin entertainment. In a slightly different venue, Dan Brown (\\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"Angels and Demons\\") is a master of taking historical fact and wrapping compelling fiction around it.<br />Unfortunately, James Rollins' \\"Amazonia\\" shares none of these characteristics. In a needlessly long and overdramatic epic the hero, Nathan Rand, glumly plods through an totally unrealistic Amazon/jungle in search of his father lost four years before. The search is revived after a member of Rand's father's party, former CIA-agent Gerald Clark, emerges from the jungle barely alive and horribly diseased. It turns out that whatever Clark contracted in the jungle is highly contagious, and a dangerous plague is rapidly spreading across the Americas. So the race is on, not only to find clues to the senior Rand's disappearance, but also to find the magical cure for the dreaded plague. This is the Amazon/ of Hollywood in which Anaconda's are 40-feet long and Piranhas frantically eat all in their paths. It is a jungle of flora and fauna impossibly dangerous where chances for survival are distantly remote. Worst, Rollins succumbs to the popular politically correct convention wisdom: the source of all evil is drug companies and the military while the secrets to life and happiness are all merely waiting for discovery in the dense Amazonian forests - assuming of course the evil capitalists don't destroy it first.<br />Rollins characters are as thin as the plot; the dialogue painfully melodramatic and clich?d. (\\"Nathan Rand's gaze was as hard as the Rangers', but there was a glint of something more. A vein of icy determination.\\") Bottom line: with an unbelievable plot, bland and stereotyped characters, non-descriptive prose, and a tidy and predictable Hollywood ending, this one is better left off that list for this summer's relaxed beach reading.stereotyped characters, non-descriptive prose, and a tidy and predictable Hollywood ending, this one is better left off that list for this summer's relaxed beach reading.	2003-07-12

It is the tale of Darren Camponi, a New York private investigator who is assigned to locate an old high school classmate, Jason Caufield.  Cuafield, assigned as a researcher at an Ohio university, has been accused of stealing intellectual property from the school. Soon Camponi realizes there is much more to the case than a simple matter of locating Caufield, as \\"government\\" thugs start popping up and people close to the case begin having mysterious accidents, or worse.  The progress of Caufield's research is apparently of keen interest to a number of interested and sinister parties.<br />Misak's style is easily read, but fails to capture much in setting or emotion.  Nor do the rather thinly developed characters inspire much empathy from the reader as they slog through mostly unimaginative dialogue.  But the story is lively and fresh enough to overcome the literary obstacles, and does a credible job of holding the readers attention.  The time devoted to actual time travel - surprisingly brief given the subject matter - is clever and darkly humorous.  The actual method of time travel, while (thankfully) light on the science, is unique and mildly intriguing.  It is unfortunate that more time was not spent on the payoff, and less in the setup.<br />While \\"Time Stand Still\\" is lacking in some respects, all things considered, it provides a satisfying passage of time on the beach or in a plane.	2003-05-01

If there were a measurement for the addictive character of a book  that subtle quality that hooks the reader early and makes the book virtually impossible to put down  Derailed would be the Gold Medallist.  First time author James Siegel tells the story of Charles Schine, a New York advertising executive who, meeting a beautiful female executive while commuting on the Long Island Railroad, soon finds his typically mundane life spiraling ever more deeply out of control.  Siegels prose is fast, tight, and riveting, with just enough non-linearity to keep the reader on the edge.  Yet despite the leanness, characters and settings are fully developed and wholly credible. Think of Tom Wolfes Bonfire of the Vanities on pure adrenalin, written with the economy of words and razor wit of a master advertising creative director (which Siegel is).  Reviews have paralleled Derailed with Hitchcock  a valid comparison in the unexpected twists.  But much of the allure is in the pure believability of the plot - the realization of how fragile the boundary between boring but comfortable and sheer, unmitigated terror is.  Bottom line: if you are only going to read one thriller this year, make it Derailed.  Just make sure you dont have any plans for the next several hours when you start.	2003-03-19

Protagonist Hitchcock Sewell, part time detective and full time ladies man, also happens to be an undertaker.  Preposterous!  Bizarre!  But, as it turns out, downright entertaining!<br />Set in Baltimore and Annapolis, Maryland, our hero sets out to help a former flame (Hitchcock apparently has many) get to the bottom of the death of the familys nanny.  While written off by the local police as a classic suicide, the family suspects a much more sinister explanation, in which Hitch is happy to oblige.  From there author Tim Cockey succeeds in spinning a good-old-fashioned mystery as undertaker-sleuth Sewell keeps turning up the leads while annoying the authorities and exerting his irrepressible charms on various lady folk.  What makes it all work is the cast of zany and off-beat characters, cast with quick pace and a lively and witty, if incredulous, dialogue.  The style is more Lawrence Sanders Archie McNally-series than the darker, grittier works of Robert Crais or Dennis Lehane.  But Cockeys tongue-in-cheek approach, falling just short of parodying the well-traveled hardboiled PI genre, is refreshing and effective.<br />In the final analysis, Murder in the Hearst Degree is engaging and engrossing  before I remembered how much I wasnt going to like it I was sucked-in and addicted.  With four Hitchcock Sewell stories in the series preceding this one, I expect there will be more of Tim Cockey I'll be trying not to like.	2003-03-10

The usually wisecracking Cole is subdued; the unflappable Joe Pike at times uncertain and and even shaken.  The plot, centered around the kidnapping of Cole-girlfriend Lucy Chenier's young son, explains the somber tone, as few scenarios are more disturbing than one in which a child's life is in jeopardy.  The author's treatment of the characters is more developed than in previous installments, dispassionately exposing the brutal and troubled pasts of both Cole and Pike.  Considering the deteriorating relationship between Cole and Chenier, LAPD inter-office politics, the arrogant and scheming father of the boy, and a trio of truly bad... criminals, this is one dark and foreboding tale.  There is ample mystery and some intersting twists, complemented by some very convincing crime scene forensics and detective work. Crais pulls this all off with his usual efficient grace and style, spinning a tight drama that once underway builds to a riveting and non-formulaic conclusion.<br />If there is a criticism - and this is minor - it is a unsettling sense that with the number of important issues uncovered, there were simply not enough pages allowed to adequately address them all.  I couldn't help feeling that an over zealous editor stripped away much of the author's intended content which, while not confusing the story, leaves a vaguely unfinished feeling to some of the most important messages Crais apparently wants to convey.<br />But don't let this put you off.  \\"The Last Detective\\" is a solid and fast read, unique in the series, and well worth the investment of time and money.  As always, I'll be anxiously awaiting his next effort.	2003-03-01

Umberto Eco's \\"Name of the Rose\\", Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Rose\\", more recently Boston Teran's \\"God is a Bullet\\", to name a few.  \\"The Dante Club\\", the remarkable debut of writer Matthew Pearl, is another example that represents a bold, ambitious, and refreshing approach to the familiar serial killer \\"whodunnit\\".<br /><br />I'll admit that at first I was somewhat leery of the concept: the Fireside Poets - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell cast as investigators of a string of horrific murders?  An ambitious premise for a novel, for sure, but more aptly, bizarre and ripe with risk.  Pearl, however, pulls this off with a curious combination of the poet's love of the language and the storyteller's knack for pace and action.<br /><br />The \\"Dante Club\\" refers to the group assembled by Longfellow - including Holmes and Lowell - to assist him in the first American translation of Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\".  As people in high places - a judge, a minister, a wealthy merchant - turn up tortured and murdered in scenes recreating those described in Dante's classic, the poets hit the streets of Boston and Cambridge in search of the killer.  The result is an exceptionally well-researched book that is rich in historical detail while capturing the post-Civil War American psyche and culture.  Pearl's description of the Civil War horrors and post-war trauma is especially gripping.  Not since \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or \\"Se7en\\" have murders been so brutally and vividly portrayed, as the victims are variously eaten-alive by maggots, buried upside-down and set on fire, and (literally) cut in half.  Yet despite the graphic butchery, this is a book that must not be rushed, but savored for the intricacy of the plot and the intensity of the prose.  It is the rare book that draws the reader to revisit the poetry of Longfellow, US history in the wake of the Civil War, and the mystery of Dante in 19th century America.  In summary, a stunning first novel from a writer destined to become a household name.  Don't miss it!, and the mystery of Dante in 19th century America.

In other words, this is the book that HP and the HP board want the public to read, facing the release of a competing and more critical book (\\"Backfire\\" by Peter Burrows).  In \\"Perfect Enough\\", Fiorina is positioned favorably - a lone crusader in a sexist culture of engineers who have lost the \\"shining soul\\" that made the company and its founders legend.  She is depicted as the grim and embattled hero, fighting and winning the good fight against impossible obstacles both internal and external.  It would be wrong to accuse Fiorina of wrecking the celebrated \\"HP Way\\", already in steep decline long before her tenure.  But to portray her as the staunch defender of a cause she seems not to understand, and trivializes through slogans and catch-phases, is a far more serious offense which Anders chooses to overlook.<br /> Much has been made of the unfettered access the author was granted to Carly and the board, resulting in a detailed account of the HP recollection of events behind closed doors.  But unless you are really interested in the menus of the lunches served to the board in critical meetings, I'd recommend Burrows' book for an \\"unsanctioned\\", but far more balanced, portrait of the events leading to HP's acquisition of Compaq.	2003-02-18

Not to be confused with the more popular but less talented Michael Connolly, John's command of the language conjures vivid images and creates characters of substance and depth.  ...P>But while \\"Dark Hallow\\", the second of three tales of novels of ex-NYPD cop Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker, is lyrical in style, the content is as tough, gritty, and hard as the best of Jim Thompson, James Lee Burke, Dennis Lehane, or newcomer Boston Teran.  Parker, having moved from New York to the woods of Maine following the brutal murder of his wife and daughter the previous year, is drawn into a series of murders and mysteries eerily similar to the serial murder of young women years before.  The earlier murders were the obsession of Parker's policeman-grandfather, which haunted him to his grave.  Back in a supporting roles are the bizarrely odd couple of Angel and Louis, thief and assassin, respectively, who Parker considers his closest friends and allies.  Connolly hooks the reader in early through a pair of seemingly unrelated but simultaneous events.  One, the suicide of an old woman fleeing from an elderly care facility, and the other, an underworld ambush on the Maine coast, set the stage for a intricate plot that twists to an exciting and satisfying climax.<br />In summary, in the overcrowded field of crime-hardened ex-cops and private eyes, John Connolly brings a fresh and welcomed change to the genre, and is definitely worth reading.	2003-02-15

In order to build a cogent thesis, Burrows takes on a broad range of topics, including pertinent biographical background of the key players, the legend and lore of Hewlett Packard - the company and the founders - and the arcane mechanics of proxy votes and corporate government.  But while the subject matter risks could easily yield a pompous and boring analytical tome, the author injects exactly the right amount of intrigue, drama, treachery, and humor while capturing characters that are wholly believable in their flaws, foibles, and ultimate victory or defeat.  The economy of Burrows' prose, sharpened by years of reporting for \\"Business Week\\", yields a tale that is a true page-turner with much more energy, excitement, and personality than the standard business fare.<br /><br />Any frequent \\"Business Week\\" reader knows that Burrows is no fan of Carly Fiorina. Consequently, the author was not granted official access to either Fiorina or HP officials (HP denies any connection, citing only \\"scheduling conflicts\\").  Notwithstanding, his portrayal of HP's embattled CEO is vivid and wholly believable.  Fiorina, the marketer and master-of-spin with no prior CEO experience, is injected into the venerable but stumbling culture of Hewlett-Packard.  A veteran of the politics and bureaucracy of AT&T and Lucent, she is an unusual match for the techno-nerd culture of HP, where products trump hype and integrity and loyalty are revered.  But while Burrows' criticism of Fiorina is biting and unrestrained, due credit is given to her tenacity, oratory skills, and relentless dedication to completing the acquisition at all costs.  Walter Hewlett, who rises from a cocoon academic obscurity to fight-the-good-fight is treated much more charitably, but he only barely qualifies as the hero of the tale. While recognized for his honor and integrity in refusing to allow the proxy fight to deteriorate into personal attacks on Fiorina, his actions and judgment as a board member in the weeks and months prior to the planned merger's announcement are rightfully questioned.  If there is a villain in the story, it is HP's board of directors.  It is the board that passively watched while HP failed to capitalize on the rise of the Internet in the mid-late nineties, allowing HP to degenerate to a position of significance only in its printers. It was the board that initiated a bizarre, if not amateurish, CEO search leaving Fiorina as virtually the only real candidate for this high-profile job.<br /><br />Much is made of the demise of the celebrated \\"HP Way\\". But Burrows wisely resists the temptation to attribute all of the responsibility for this decline on Fiorina.  While it is successfully argued that she failed to grasp the true significance of this unique culture, further alienating frustrated employees, by the time Fiorina arrived on the scene it was already in steep decline.  What was once an honored tradition of mutual respect and pride in innovation had been replaced by a sense of entitlement and an excuse for sloth.  It is unfortunate, Burrows notes, than in the age of Enron and WorldCom, with corporate America in desperate need of the principals and values that embodied the \\"HP Way\\", that there is little chance of resuscitation under Fiorina's reign.<br /><br />In summary, \\"Backfire\\" is a masterful portrayal of the rise-and-fall of an American icon, and a revealing expos&eacute; for the behind-the-scenes machinations of history's largest technology merger and ugliest proxy fight.  It is a must read for anyone interested in the history of Silicon Valley, executive leadership, corporate governance, or corporate culture.  In the subsequent dissections of the HP/Compaq post-merger failures (or, less likely, successes) that are sure to come over the next several years, Peter Burrows' \\"Backfire\\" will serve as a frequently quoted and pivotal reference point.re sure to come over the next several years, Peter Burrows' \\"Backfire\\" will serve as a frequently quoted and pivotal reference point.	2003-02-11

Six months following the assumed suicide of Taylor Greene, the son of a wealthy developer, an enigmatic Dane Rudd shows up to attend a memorial service for Greene.  Taylor Greene was an organ donor, and Rudd, as it turns out, is the recipient of Taylor's corneas.  The mysterious Rudd sticks around, endearing himself to the dead boy's father, and entangling himself in an unofficial investigation of Greene's death.<br />Unlike the parched and barren southern California wasteland in which Teran set his first two blockbuster mystery-thrillers (\\"God is a Bullet\\" and Never Count Out the Dead\\"), \\"Deadly Weapons\\" is set in the more-lush, but none-the-less barren, California Sacramento River delta.  The delta is an overlooked region of the west, full of contradictions and extremes - a land virtually lost in time within the shadow of San Francisco and Silicon Valley.  Teran is true to his literary accolades in painting a vivid picture of the people and geography of the delta.  But unlike the his first two efforts, in which the brutality of the characters, deeds, and settings literally grab the reader by the throat refusing to let go, \\"Deadly Weapons\\" tends to meander into too much a somber study of lost lives and missed opportunities.  One can't help feeling that Teran tried to hard to make this novel \\"important\\", and in the process blunted the edge of what should have been another creative, dark, and compelling tale.<br />All things considered, though, this is a book worth reading.  Teran still demonstrates a unique literary talent, spinning the most simple phase or event in an engaging cross between prose and poetry.  Despite its shortcomings, Boston Teran can write, and I'll look forward to his next installment.	2003-01-13

In an unusual twist to the familiar \\"coming of age\\" theme, a group of pre-teens in rural 1960 Illinois confront a millenniums-old evil force threatening their village.  The writer is in no hurry to get the reader to the payoff, painstakingly weaving the mystery thread-by-thread, with a rich and convoluted cast of villains, both real and surreal.  While on the longish side (600 pages), it is well-paced, building to a truly terrifying and suspenseful climax.  Simmons' writing, while falling short of Steven King's vivid imagery, is far from pedestrian. He demonstrates a true talent for spinning a contrast of the innocence of growing up in an earlier era with the malevolence of the ancient horror that is making a mess of the cherished summer vacation.  Despite the dark theme of the story, Simmons injects considerable tongue-in-cheek humor, seeing life through a young boy's eyes, where all teachers are old and mean, the principal is to be feared and avoided, and the school is the center of all things bad and boring.  And while Simmons takes some license in the incredible level of maturity, ingenuity, and intelligence of this group of twelve-year olds, this is, after-all, fantasy.  In the final analysis, \\"Summer of Night\\" is a well-crafted and unique mixture of nostalgia and familiar childhood fears.  A highly recommended read.	2002-12-23
US	52172447	R3J1V0DLJKWUJJ	0066214122	245555180	Prey	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Jurassic Swarm	Not since \\"Jurassic Park\\" has Michael Crichton written a novel as simply entertaining and spellbinding as \\"Prey\\".  The plot is straightforward: a Silicon Valley-based start-up's experiment in the blend of nano-technology and biological engineering has gone horribly wrong, creating a sinister yet virtually invisible malevolence.  Jack Forman, an unemployed programmer married to an executive of the errant startup, becomes the unsuspecting and reluctant hero.  To establish a foundation of credibility, Crichton must devote some time to the basic science involved.  But while some have found these interludes dry or unnecessary, I found these brief side roads fascinating - highly relevant to the story, expertly distilled to the layman's perspective, and well-blended with the story line.  The parallels between distributed programming, for example, and highly socialized animal communities - like termites - added a dimension to this thriller that few contemporary writers besides Crichton could pull off.  Some will have problems with the liberties taken with the science, while others will take issue with Crichton's obvious political views of the subject matter.  My advice: forget the politics and the science - just sit back and be prepared to enjoy one of the best yarns of the last decade.	2002-12-23

While much of Clancy's traditional appeal lies in his attention to detail, it is overdone in \\"Red Rabbit\\", resulting in an overly long and sluggishly paced novel.  The treatment of Jack Ryan was most surprising.  While much has been made of his rather minor role in this book, as Mary-Pat and Ed Foley take center stage for the good guys, that was a refreshing change of pace.  Rather, I found the relationship between Jack and Cathy Ryan distracting and, frankly, annoying.  Eliminating Ryan completely would have shortened the book and improved the story line.  The avid Clancy reader will want to read this to fill in some background, especially behind the Foleys, while fans of 20th Century history may enjoy this plausible and apparently well-researched account of the attempted assassination.  But in the final analysis, this is not Clancy's best work. A thorough edit-out of about 200 pages would bring significant improvement.	2002-11-30

In his best work since \\"Presumed Innocence\\", Scott Turow weaves a masterpiece of interpersonal relationships and legal suspense in \\"Reversible Errors\\". At his best, Turow's legal prose is much more powerful and thoughtful than the more popular John Grisham, and this is an example of the master at the top of his game. The main story line is familiar enough: a condemned man about to be executed for a decade-old triple murder has one last shot at reprieve. But while the tale may be common, the characters are not: deeply developed, multi-faceted, and flawed, absent both super-heroes and arch-villains. The main characters include Arthur Raven, the socially dysfunctional court-appointed defense attorney, and Gillian Sullivan, the judge who presided over the original trial, now an ex-con and ex-junkie. They are joined by the upwardly mobile prosecuting attorney Muriel Wynn, and her once and future affair-mate, Larry Starczek, the detective who gathered the evidence in the murder case of death-row resident Rommy Gandolph, who awaits imminent execution. As the appeal winds through a series of triumphs and disappointments for both sides, the reader is drawn more deeply into the complex characters and the relationships between them. He adroitly interweaves story lines between 1991 and 2001; the non-linearity adding to the interest and intrigue. The author does not try overly hard to build the mystery, putting instead his efforts behind the convoluted relationships of the main characters. \\"Reversible Errors\\" is a classic case of the reward being in the journey, rather than the final destination. Always a master of legal details and courtroom drama, Turow introduces a new dimension to his talents. While not much of a \\"feel-good\\" book, \\"Reversible Errors\\" is definitely one of the more intelligent reads of 2002.	2002-11-30

Painstakingly researched and rich in historical detail, Mike Dash succeeds in combining a rare insight of the arduous life aboard sailing ships of the period with a chilling narrative of the bloodiest known mutiny of all time.  One not need to be a history buff to appreciate this brutal story of a charismatic but twisted psychopath capable of mesmerizing the crowd, and leading them to a catastrophic end.	2002-11-29

His work is painfully researched (accounting for the relatively short list of published works) and beautifully written.  December 6 is no exception, as Smith again demonstrates the range of his talents, this time setting the story in 1941 Tokyo.  He spins the unusual story of Harry Niles, the son of American missionaries stationed in Japan.  Alienated from his parents as they are off proselytizing in rural Japan, Harry is left to grow up on the streets of Tokyo.  Much more Japanese in culture and beliefs than American, the enigmatic Niles, now an adult Tokyo nightclub owner, finds himself in a precarious situation on the eve of the Pacific World War II.<br />Give Smith credit for creativity: this is certainly an unusual, if not bizarre, subject for a story.  Harry Niles is a mysterious main character.  Accepted fully by neither western nor eastern cultures, perpetually only a step ahead of (or behind) the law, the reader never knows exactly where to categorize Niles: hero, spy, traitor, patriot?.  Supporting characters are likewise complex and unable to be easily quantified.  Michiko, Harrys mistress: the cool and aloof juke-box jockey, yet also the submissive geisha.  Ishigami, the sword-yielding samurai demon with a uniquely Japanese penchant for both honor and terror.  Smith adroitly blends Japanese tradition in the background, avoiding the tendancy of many western authors writing of Japan to allow the culture to overshadow the story.  The imminent war is portrayed from a uniquely Japanese, and fatalistic, perspective.  Like all of Smiths novels, the characters and events are intricately woven in a complex fabric of intrigue and suspense, leading to a surreal, nearly mystical, climax.<br />What December 6 lacks in sheer thrills and fast action of Gorky Park is compensated by the intelligent and convoluted story line and though-provoking characters.  As with all of Smiths novels, December 6 leaves the reader anxiously awaiting his next effort.cters.

US	52172447	R1Q4E7JZVNVRT7	0399149244	81364874	Tricky Business	Books	3	7	9	N	Y	Off Course	I'm a big Dave Barry fan.  I rarely miss his weekly column, and have read many of his \\"non-fiction\\" books prior to his first novel, &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  So it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the release of Tricky Business.  I was only mildly disappointed.  &quot;Tricky Business&quot; was slicker - more skillfully written - than \\"Trouble\\", but it has a darker, more ominous tone than Barry's typical writing.  While has Barry succeeded in pulling off this slight divergence from his usual course, it comes at some expense to trademark wry wit and insightful observations of the dumb things people do.  As in much of Barry's work, southern Florida (richy justified) bears the brunt of his light sarcasm.  And the cast of characters, while memorable, is not up to par with the zany misfits and malcontents from Big Trouble.  While \\"Business\\" will evoke many chuckles, I didn't find myself laughing out loud as I usually do when reading Dave Barry.<br />In the final analysis, though, this is a darkly humorous book that is worth the time and money.  Longtime Barry fans will find enough of the master to hold interest, while the uninitiated may find Tricky Business has an acceptable alternative to Carl Hiaasen.	2002-11-28

What is surprising is that while living in the eye-of-the-storm through this mostly tumultuous period in IBM's extraordinarily rich and often bizarre history, Gerstner writes from afar, more an outsider looking in than the leader credited with the turnaround.<br />It is the success of the System 360, which carried IBM for decades and helped entrench an already insular and isolated culture, that was the villain, claims Gerstner. IBM needed to get in touch with the customer, get focused, and get back to the basics of execution. This is all true, and provides some interesting reading and insightful observation, but it leaves the reader yearning for more of the infighting and political maneuvering that was occurring both inside and outside the boardrooms. Those not familiar with IBM's unique culture will chuckle at some of the sparsely used anecdotes, while insiders will be disappointed in the virtual absence of any of the real drama that occurred, especially in the early months of Lou's tenure. Always the politician, names aren't named except for fleeting praise for select individuals. While Gerstner closes by claiming his deep love for a devotion to IBM, he still comes off as the perpetual outsider.<br />Perhaps one of the more interesting elements of the book is not what is told, or even what is left out, but rather what yet cannot be told. That is, five-years from now, will Gerstner's grand but unfinished plan to transform IBM into a services company still be considered a brilliant and bold strategic coup? Or will many of the changes in IBM over the past decade be simply attributed to adroit realignment of employee-related benefits and retirement benefits and long overdue expense reductions? We'll have to wait for Sam Palmisano's book to find out.	2002-11-28
US	52172447	R1HTTCNQLXAZN7	0743411439	995472619	Bitterroot	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Bold and Ambitious	In \\"Bitterroot\\", James Lee Burke leaves his familiar haunts of coastal Louisiana and tackles Montana's Big Sky country with a new cast of mostly memorable new characters.  The story surrounds Billy Bob Holland, an attorney from Texas, summoned to Montana to help our old-friend Tobin \\"Doc\\" Voss, a widower living in rural Montana with his teenage daughter.  From a simple premise, the story twists and winds though a series of tales of revenge, retribution, and redemption, melding the past with the present for both the characters and the state.<br />This novel is nothing if not ambitious.  Burke takes on virtually all the issues Montana is facing today: environmentalism, Indian rights, non-nazi militants, renegade bikers, invasion from west coast yuppies and Hollywood coke heads.  But the story is told apolitically, and if the author is trying to make a statement, he mercifully keeps any personal views well hidden.  As typical of Burke's work, the prose is rich, descriptive, and plentiful, and the subplots so numerous that a scorecard would be handy.  I found myself flipping back through the pages several times to keep track of who-was-who and with whom they were affiliated.  But that is standard Burke fare, as the complexity of the story, the characters, and the issues are all part of the ride.  It seems like everyone has a hidden past with some axe to grind, and Burke makes sure that every one is given ample pages to develop their case.  With a less talented author, this would have been a muddled and convoluted disaster.  But Burke pulls it off - barely.  While this is definitely an enjoyable and compelling read, it would have benefited from fewer issues to resolve and a leaner, more focused plot.	2002-07-06

James Lee Burke's widely recognized talent for creating rich setting is in top form: the Louisiana gulf coast back woods and bars are easily visualized, the smells of the oil rigs and shrimp boats waft from the pages. The English language is Burke's toolbox - as a blunt object hammering the reader with raw brutality, or as a scalpel in unlayering the subtleties of race and social strata. Few villains have been created as foreboding and ominous as the mysterious \\"Legion\\", casting an aura of nearly biblical good vs. evil and an unexpected, almost \\"King-like\\" surrealism.<br />This latest in the Dave Robicheaux series is built around the rape and murder of a local teenage girl, followed by a string of apparently related homicides. But the story is virtually void of the usual crime scene forensics and criminal investigation. Instead, Burke introduces a full cast of deeply developed characters and settings, slowly building tension and mystery as not only the murders, but also a dark history, gradually unfold. Burke is clearly not in a hurry in getting to the punch line, winding through passages of time and place, connecting the past with the present and reality with a vague sense of the supernatural. But while Burke's prose meanders, it is not without purpose, as the reader is sucked deeper and deeper into the intrigue. The reward is not in reaching the climax, but the journey in getting there.<br />In summary, Burke is about as good as writer as there is today in American fiction, and \\"Jolie Blon's Bounce\\" displays his craft at its peak. This is a dark and brooding tale with a surreal twist that will linger long after the book is finished, leaving the reader anxious for Burke's next installment.	2002-07-01

Written by a less accomplished author, the material would be merely disgusting - Harris, however, succeeds in painting an engrossing canvas with his gore, creating images that are repulsive yet strangely irresistable.  I found my self not wanting to turn the pages, but unable to put the book down.  Part of this is due in part to Harris' imagination in creating horror so unique, so bizarre, and so totally over the top that it cannot be ignored.  The imagery of being eaten alive by wild pigs, for example, is so vividly portrayed that the scene continues to haunt nearly a year after I've read the book.  This is not a believable story, nor a literary achievement, and it is certainly not for the faint of heart or the easily offended.  But if you've got the stomach, and enjoy a well-written work of raw horror, forget the critics and give this demented tale of \\"Ms. Manners does cannibalism\\" a ride.	2002-06-18

I've read three Michael Connelly mysteries now, and I'm trying - really hard - to enjoy them, and to understand all the buzz and the great reviews.  I just can't seem to get there.  This was my first Harry Bosch and I found it, well, kind of boring.  The book was at lot about Harry and his various relationships - with Edgar, his cardboard partner, with his boss, with the bueatiful rookie cop, with the assistant chief of police...  And, oh yeah, and there was actually a mystery to solve going on in the background, though it seemed almost a distraction to both Connelly and Bosch.<br />This wasn't a bad book - but essentially &quot;CoB&quot; is just another average crime novel.  I've found Connelly's work rather sterile:  today's really accomplished writers of this genre (Lehane, Crais, Burke, Teran,...) will build a scene which lets you feel the grit in the streets and smell the decay from the projects. Connelly, on the other hand, just kind of &quot;tells&quot; the story.  The cities and the characters have a &quot;plastic&quot; feel to them; the situations overly simplied and contrived.  Not much passion, little regional flavor, nothing to really grab the reader and reel them in.  Perhaps the hardened Bosch fan will find this hard to put down, but in the final analysis, &quot;City of Bones&quot; is just another tale of LA.  Others have done it much more effectively.	2002-06-17

Private investigator Elvis Cole is in his best wisecracking form, while Joe Pike's stoic form is always there exactly when needed.  The change in venue was a refreshing change of pace, and the east coast-west coast banter was humorous and effective, as Crais succeeds in poking fun at both the shallowness of Hollywood and the brutishness of the east coast crime families.  Despite a typically dark and threatening plot, Crais keeps the pace light and the one-liners flowing, building up steam towards an exciting - if not particularly surprising - climax.  All in all, a more than satisfying read, and well worth the time invested.	2002-06-11

The story has an interesting and rather off beat premise, and moves through the pages at a \\"mostly\\" brisk and lively pace. But the reader is asked to make too many leaps of faith along the way, feeling just a bit too much like a made-for-TV movie. Terrell McCaleb, the ex-FBI agent with a new heart, moves a little to freely through the LAPD and the FBI in his private and unauthorized investigation of a pair of seemingly unrelated random murders. The love affair with his client is sappy and unnecessary, except for its inevitable role in a formulaic ending. And for the crime-solving genius that McCaleb is made out to be, you think he'd eventually remember to check his voicemail. For the most part, the characters felt hastily developed, relying more on stereotype than on any thoughtful personality development by the author.<br />But on balance, \\"Blood Work\\" is an entertaining, but not riveting, mystery. The plot had some clever twists and as mentioned, is built around an unusual theme. The killer was deftly hidden and skillfully revealed, though the climax felt rushed and contrived. In the final analysis, \\"Blood Work\\" is a rather ordinary pop thriller/mystery that feels good while it lasts, but won't be much remembered a few days hence.	2002-06-08

As with all of Smith's novels, \\"Rose\\" is meticulously researched and rich in historical and cultural detail.  Unike many popular authors of today who crank out hastily written and thinly developed book-upon-book to maximize commercial gain, Smith writes infrequently and carefully, choosing each word of dialogue and each scene for accuracy and maximum impact.<br />\\"Rose\\" is the tale of Jonathan Blair, a British mining engineer who longs to return to Africa and his African wife and daughter.  To earn passage, he is sent to Wigan, a dark and destitute English mining town, to solve the mystery of the disappearance of the fiance of the Bishop's daughter.  Smith's tale twists through Wigan in a series of turns - chilling in the bleakness and brutality of this 19th Century coal town and its guarded and mistrustful populace.  Blair, suffering and often barely alive with malaria, sweats and feints through a series of beatings, discoveries, dangerous liasons, and ultimate triumph.  The characters are richly developed, and as dark as the smokestack-blackened skies of Wigan.<br />This is a highly unusual, intelligent, and satisfying work of fiction.  Like all of Smith's novels, you'd be wise not to miss it.	2002-05-28

Cole's wise-cracking is a little overdone, stretching credibility, as do some of the scenes,  particularly the escape from jail.  Also, unless I was not paying attention well enough, there seem to be some loose ends that are never resolved (like the red 36C?).  The bad guys - inluding both the cops and the south-central LA gang-bangers - feel somewhat rushed in development and have little depth; more stereotyped than I've come to expect from Crais.<br />But the bodies keep piling up and the pages keep turning.  On balance, if you're not expecting a classic, and don't want to do much thinking,  &quot;Free Fall&quot; won't disappoint.  A definite choice for a coast-to-coast flight or an afternoon on the beach.	2002-05-28

In this, the fourth in the series with Patrick McKenzie and Angela Gennaro, our working-class Boston PI duo reluctantly accepts a child abduction case, and soon find themselves in the middle of a far more complex and baffling crime. As in all of Lehane's novels, characters are deeply developed and vividly cast. A more colorful charcter than 'Cheese\\" Olomon, the \\"six-foot-two, four-hundred-and-thirty-pound yellow-haired Scandinavian who'd somehow arrived at the misconception he was black\\" drug dealer/convict, does not easily come to mind. And while there are no doubt real life characters as twisted and dispicable as the husband and wife team of Leon and Roberta Trett, Lehane's portrayal of their evil literally makes skin crawl and blood boil.<br />The plot twists and turns through a number of surprises, peppered with expertly timed side trips to anecdotes and flash backs of relevant people or events. The dialog is tight and smart, and the pace never drags. Once hooked, this is a very difficult book to put down, and one that refuses to go away long after the last page is turned. If you're a fan of fast paced, intelligent crime mystery, and aren't afraid of a strong dose of grisly realism, \\"Gone, Baby, Gone\\" is simply a must read.	2002-05-13

It \\"stars\\" Felicia 'Flick' Clairet, a British agent married to a French resistance fighter. As with many of Follett's novels, the sub plot of a love affair is woven into the story line, likely to insure additional appeal for broader audience, as well as the attraction for a possible screen play. Follett at his best is a master story teller, and he is in top form with \\"Jackdaws\\". He crafts a suspense that is palpable and engrossing, set with just enough history to establish some credibility. But while the plot and story development are superb, the same level of depth falls short in the character development. The characters appear to come straight from central casting: the brave but irreverent hero/spy, the sadistic Nazi officer, a female crew of ally agents reminiscent of \\"The Dirty Dozen\\". On balance, a good book for the beach or a long plane trip: mindless entertainment that will neither make you think nor disappoint.	2002-05-13

Requiem (Elvis Cole)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Crime Fiction at its Best	\\"The devils take their toll, even in this angel town.\\"  So muses Elvis Cole, the hardboiled private detective protagonist near the end of this gritty and suspenceful crime drama.  Unlike others in the Elvis Cole series, where partner Joe Pike is essentially a mysterious and menacing shadow, Crais skillfully weaves flashbacks into the plot, exposing Pike's dark and troubled past bit by disturbing bit.  As in his previous works, Crais' characters are vividly developed and, if not completely believable, they are compelling and certainly entertaining.  Nobody does LA better than Robert Crais, and I'm beginning to believe no contemporary writer does noir crime as well, either.<br />The plot is simple enough: Cole and Pike are called on by the wealthy and well-connected father of a murdured Latino girl to assist LAPD in finding the killer.  Predictably, tensions arise as the cops don't welcome the outside interference.  This tension is only heightened by a troubled history Pike shares with the force, which slowly unfolds as the plot progresses.  This is an ambitious book with strong moral undertones, complex emotions, and raw physical violence.  It is not an easy book to put down, nor will it be quickly forgotten.  Don't let this one get away.	2002-05-08

In case [URL} is not sufficient, you can now get an additional dose in convenient paperback!  The premise is enticing enough: secret, surprising and salacious documents - a veritable treasure chest of dirt, sleaze, and slime!  Who could resist the temptation?  But, if the reviews of other readers are the basis, I may be alone in finding \\"The Smoking Gun\\" boring and tedious.  About as compelling, I guess, as reading unedited police reports and law suits - which is exactly what it is.  I guess when it comes right down to it, I really don't find a letter from Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs' doctor - as an excuse for a canceled tour - all that interesting.

The last chapter, \\"Patently Absurd\\" includes some gems like the \\"human gas filter pad for wearing in the underwear\\" and a method for bar coding humans.  And the \\"strap secured condom\\".  Glad to see the US patent attorneys hard at work.<br />On balance, I should have realized that we're already overexposed to the excesses and absurdities of life in America - especially where celebrities are involved.  The additional manifestation in raw legal documents, police reports, and court transcripts is simply more than I care about knowing, and frankly is not all that revealing, anyway.	2002-04-21

His ability to make the most mundance events or setting terrifying, and his keen grasp of human nature and human foibles place him near the top in pure literary genius.  That he happens to write horror is only incidental, and in a way unfortunate, for the mass market appeal of his novels and stories has prevented King receiving due credit as one of the great American writers of modern times.<br />Perhaps King's legacy will begin to change with \\"Everything's Eventual\\".  This is an eclectic and versatile collection of short stories, in which his talents are generously displayed.  It has been a while since I've read Stephen King, and I couldn't help but notice a subtle change in style - a melancholly wisdom and maturity I've overlooked in any of King's earlier works.  \\"All that you Love Will be Carried Away\\" is a beautifully sad, yet darkly humorous story that captures this theme of resigned fatalism.  \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\", while as terrifying a story as King has ever writen, has a depth and moral undertone that transcends King's familiar \\"Good vs. Evil\\" story line.  For shear gut-turning terror, it doesn't get much better than \\"Autopsy Room Four\\": leave it to King to have the reader not wanting to turn the page, yet unable to overcome the morbid curiosity, while at the same time finding humor in an autopsy about to be performed on a very-much-alive patient.  \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" tells a tale of the John Derringer gang, and \\"In the Deathroom\\" finds an American reporter caught in a brutal in a south American interrogation chamber. \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" is told from the roughly autobiographical viewpoint that King does so well, and who but King could make even a yard sale ominous?<br />There isn't a bad story in the lot, though I found \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" playing on themes a bit too familiar.  But I suspect diehard \\"Dark Tower\\" fans may find it one of the best in the collection.  Other tales of divorce and marriages gone bad, a sinister conspiracy, and a haunted hotel room reflect classic King morbidness, yet also build on this deeper, philosophical undercurrent.<br />Each story is either introduced or closed with a brief vignette by King.  While typically I find editorial inserts annoying, In \\"Eventual\\" I found them interesting and instrumental to the overall success and flow of the book.  In summary, a must read for Stephen King fans, and a great way for the unintiated to get introduced to him.of divorce and marriages gone bad, a sinister conspiracy, and a haunted hotel room reflect classic King morbidness, yet also build on this deeper, philosophical undercurrent.<br />Each story is either introduced or closed with a brief vignette by King.

As another of the Dismas Hardy series, Lescroart brings back some familiar characters - Abe Glitsky among them - in a well crafted story that keeps the pages turning. Unlike James Patterson's \\"1st to Die\\", in which the San Francisco setting is superficial and cardboard, Lescroart's San Francisco is an accurate portrayal of the city's liberal political machine and lively culture. The \\"villains\\" are despicable enough - enough to want to see them go down, but not so much as to detract from the their credibility. The courtroom drama was as suspenseful and exciting as anything I can remember since the early works of Scott Turow. (I still consider \\"Presumed Innocent\\" the best of the genre).<br />Why only three stars? A few too many distractions that cluttered an otherwise tightly wound plot and puzzling mystery. The relationship between Abe and Treya, for example, was predictable and unneccessary, and the family connection with Cole Burgess, the suspected killer, was just a bit too much \\"mush\\". The end, while climactic, was just a bit of a letdown, detracting ever-so-slightly from the superb tale that led up to it. And finally, while Lescroart did a credible job of tagging and tracking a large cast of characters, there were simply too many floating around the pages.<br />But all things considered, this is a good read, great entertainment, and well worth the time.	2002-04-14

Crais grabs you by the throat in the first chapter, setting the stage with a hostage incident that went awry years earlier, and leading to Jeff Talley's voluntary retirement from the LAPD SWAT team to Chief of Police in a quiet southern California town.  When a convenience store robbery in Talley's town goes bad, a new hostage situation develops, and a reluctant Talley is drawn back in to the fray.<br />While Crais' strength is tight plot development and rapid-fire action that keeps the pages turning, &quot;Hostage&quot; is also rich in character development. Talley, haunted by the bad decision that forced him from LA, is vulnerable but likeable, and believable in his flaws and foibles.  Mars, one of the young punks central to the hostage situation, while perhaps predictable, is ominous and threatening in his sullen silence: a younger version of the big  blond psycho thug in &quot;Fargo&quot; comes to mind.  A family held hostage, the FBI, organized crime, small town cops: it all comes together and works much more successfully than any of the more popular suspense novels on the shelves today.<br />I found &quot;Hostage&quot; nearly impossible to put down.  The central plot was expertly woven with a number of parallel sub-plots; the dialogue tight and realistic.  Crais succeeds again in demonstrating why he is one of today's premier writers of the genre.  Don't miss it!	2002-04-14

While some of the early Alex Cross novels were creative and interesting, \\"1st to Die\\" is a disappointment in virtually all respects.  The premise of the \\"Womens' Murder Club\\" is silly, stereotyped, and boring.  The characters are thinly developed and uninteresting; the dialogue - sappy and predictable - was not worthy of a junior high essay contest.  The subplot of our heroine's medical problem was an unnecessary and maudlin distraction - perhaps inserted to fatten the page count. And, while set in San Francisco, Patterson made no effort to capture any of the flavor or feel of the city: change a few street names and it could easily have been New York, Chicago, or Des Moines.  But worst of all was the villain: straight from the cartoons, yet never as despicable as Patterson tried so hard to make him.<br />I guess the reader was supposed to be blown away by the double- twist ending, but both were so completely unbelievable, and so far removed from reality, that it was almost humorous.  What's good about 1st to Die?  Only that is was bad enough to remove any temptation of buying the sequel, or any more of Patterson's  Womens' Murder Club \\"mysteries\\".	2002-04-11

Perhaps my expectations were too high, as I found it good, but not great, fiction.  The main character -in fact the original butcher's boy - is a \\"retired\\" assassin for the mob.  Living incognito in England, he is forced to end his self-imposed exile through a series of accidental events.  From there, our hero takes a death tour of what feels like the entire US, stopping long enough in each city to kill the resident mafia boss and as many of the local thugs who happen to get in the way.  \\"Shaeffer\\" (or Wolfe, or ...) is the original one-man army - a killing machine who Rambo would die for.  This, we are led to believe, is merely a diversion: both the syndicate and the feds believe it is just another mob war (For afterall, how could one man create such massive carnage across so many states?)  Under the cover of this pseudo-war, Shaeffer is able to flee from both the bad guys and the Justice Dept, and vanish back into his life of peace and tranquility in England.  If this all seems a bit unbelievable, it is.  But \\"Dogs\\" is an entertaining story nonetheless.  There are some interesting characters, some imaginative \\"hits\\", and enough action to hold interest and keep  the pages turning.  But neither the depth of plot nor the development of the primary chactacters reach the level of a four or five star read.  Don't get me wrong - this is a much better way to pass a few hours than any of a similar genre from the best-selling authors (Patterson, Meltzer, Grisham...).  But in the final analysis, I guess I was expecting just a little more meat from the \\"Butcher's Boy\\".	2002-04-10

As in his first novel (God is a Bullet), Teran sets the scene in the gritty southern California desert wasteland.  The bleakness of the desert diners and roadhouses proves the perfect setting for a new cast of Teran characters: hard women, bad cops, an agoraphobic writer.  Unlike \\"Bullet\\", in which sometimes Teran's overly rich language gets in the way of his story, the prose in \\"Dead\\" is lean, tight, and gripping.  If you like the happy plastic people found in James Patterson and other popular \\"thriller\\" writers, either of Boston Teran's novels will likely disturb and possibly offend your senses.  But if you're looking for an in-your-face, by-the-throat, modern tale of noir and raw-boned terror, THIS is your ride.	2002-04-05

The origins or McDonalds, Carl's Junior, KFC, and others provided a brief and interesting snapshot of the social evolution of post-WWII America.  Schlosser is effective in connecting the dots between the family automoble and the life-style changes that made fast food a truly American culture.  But beyond there, he tries too hard to vilify the industry, and to politicize the topic.  While there likely are excesses and abuses in this business, I doubt that many have ever considered &quot;fast food&quot; a pillar of industrial virtue, leaving the reader underwhelmed in the &quot;truth&quot; Schlosser's reveals.  (You mean a slaughter house is an unpleasant place to work!  Gasp!  And people even may get hurt there! Oh my God!)<br />Perhaps we've all become too calloused since the muckraking hayday of Upton Sinclair to care anymore.	2002-04-04

Teran spins a vivid portrait of the landscape and life of the southern California desert, and the degenerates, losers, and loners who populate it.  Don't expect any heros in this one: even the \\"good guys\\" are bad, but as gritty and real as any author has ever succeeded in capturing in print. Though his prose can be a bit heavy and overdone at times, this is nonetheless a powerful story, and a triumphant first novel.  If you have a taste for modern-noir, don't miss this one.	2002-04-04

If you're looking for learned musings and profound business thought, look elsewhere. \\"F'd Companies\\" is written in the style of an Internet bulletin board - reading more like graffiti than The Wall Street Journal. But that's not a bad thing. Kaplan's crudely cynical critiques of ill-conceived businesses are outlandish and darkly humorous. In rapid-fire case after case, he recounts the foibles of 20-somethings as they burn through tens or hundreds of millions of dollars that venture capitalists and corporations are all to willing to throw at them.<br />A few excerpts:<br />On Digiscents, which spend $20M on a device to plug into your computer to produce \\"smells\\" relevant to the content viewed:<br />\\"Besides, potential customers weren't too keen on having a bunch of nasty-smelling chemicals pumped up their noses.\\"<br />Or \\"Flooz\\", the infamous Internet \\"alternate currency\\", which flushed over $50M in a couple of years, but also attracted thieves in Russia and the Philippines who used stolen credit cards to rack up over $300K in Flooz dollars.<br />And eHobbies, the failed online Hobby Shop, which claimed bird-watching a $34B industry - four-times larger than movie-going. When these figures were challenged in a story by The Wall Street Journal, a spokesperson explained the figures included things like \\"binoculars, hats, sunglasses, cameras, and bird-houses, and expenses incurred on bird watching trips, such as gas, hotels, the cost of renting a tent ... sales of log cabins, boats and trunks.\\"<br />I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the tales told by employees of the \\"F'd Companies\\", which make up such an important part of the website. And after a while, Pud's rants and profanity become tiresome - better taken in smaller, daily website-sized bites than in an entire book. Yet I still found the book amusing and addictive, and Kaplan's self-modesty a refreshing contrast to the arrogant and elitist attitudes of the executives and investors of whom he writes. Above all else, Kaplan captures the silliness and self-importance of the dot.com hype in a style that is unique to the Internet counter-culture. While certainly not a literary triumph, \\"F'd Companies\\" is an important reflection on this bizarre period of US business, and as such will outlast most of the dot.coms that were founded during these years.e arrogant and elitist attitudes of the executives and investors of whom he writes.

The Millionaires failed to create any real credibility with the subject matter, feeling hastily or poorly researched.  And while the basic premise showed promise,  the plot quickly unwound in a series of increasingly unbelievable turns.  It was difficult to relate to any of the characters, who lacked any real depth and had few qualities worthy of attention.  I found the story convoluted and confusing, perhaps because neither the story nor the characters were sufficient to generate any real interest in trying to figure out who was doing what, and why.	2002-03-17

Don't expect to find any of the popular \\"plastic\\" good guys and bad guys in Lehane's novels. In \\"River\\", the characters are deeply developed and meticulosly exposed in their flaws and weaknesses, adding to the realism and tension Lehane builds to the climax.  While the more estute reader may figure the perp before the payoff (I didn't), the skill of the telling and the development of setting and character is sufficient reward.	2002-03-09
