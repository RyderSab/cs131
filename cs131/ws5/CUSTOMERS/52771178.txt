Nevertheless, I loved this book.<br />In Blood Roses, CQY recaptures the style that made me like her older works -- the Palace, Blood Games, and  Tempting Fate.  The interplay between Our Favorite Count and Roger is back  up to speed in this book.  Ms Yarbro managed to avoid the pitfalls of her  recent works -- relying too heavily on Saint-Germain's insider jokes about  &quot;my ...life&quot; and &quot;those of my blood&quot;.  Instead, this is  a fresh book, with sparkling women characters and a long historical  perspective.  Her research is excellent.<br />If only we could get those  fabulous oldies back into print -- I would pay for at least two hardcover  editions of Tempting Fate -- one to keep, one to lend.  And Hotel  Transylvania... well, I was able to stumble across that in a used  bookstore, and it is certainly good enough for re-release.

He insists that the path to freedom consists of limiting the resources of very wealthy people.  <br />If you follow Jim  Wallis's line of thinking, no one deserves vast personal wealth.   Therefore, people who have achieved it must have their wealth limited by  society -- in other words, give it back.  After all, society made it  possible for the rich to accumulate their wealth in the first place,  right?<br />Wrong answer.  Wealth is a product of personal financial  responsibility and determined work.  We live in the greatest country in the  world, simply because it is possible in America for people to overcome  poverty and ascend to personal financial freedom in a single generation.   In other words, we have the ability, through our own talents and ingenuity,  to create wealth.  To make money, if you will.<br />What would be the  incentive to do so, if once we achieve personal financial freedom, we are  compelled to support others who are unable or unwilling to do what we have  done.  Charity should be a personal choice, not a social demand.  Certainly  not a legislated requirement.  If income is capped, there will be no  incentive to achieve.  People will not continue to perform if the result of  their accomplishment is social outrage, programmed guilt, and deliberate  taxation to restore them to some median level of income.<br />And if those who  are currently the investors, the entrepreneurs, the small business owners,  and the corporate visionaries are disincentivized for performing, chances  are good they will CEASE TO PERFORM.  In other words, if you place a limit,  a legal limit, for whatever moral reason you think matters, on the amount  of money people are allowed to earn, they will stop trying to earn more  than that amount.  <br />An entrepreneur or a high-powered executive invests  all he or she can into reaching their goals.  At stake may be their money,  their time, their reputation, their commitment, possibly their  relationships.  They would not be willing to take those risks without the  chance for the reward.<br />The bad news is that if their willingness to take  risks and outperform other people dies, then the &quot;magic&quot; fortune  that they could accumulate, the one Jim Wallis wants to tap to fund his  social spending programs, will vanish.  It will cease to exist.  It is an  economic fact.  <br />Entrepreneurs, visionary executives, and high earners  will no longer be there to run big businesses, to make big investments, to  build big successes.  And without them, the companies will not succeed.  No  one will be employed.<br />These are the economic realities that Jim Wallis  has overlooked.  As good as his vision sounds, unless he can personally  fund these ideas, he can not advocate them.  To do so is the equivalent of  giving the pay check of every American to the federal government, and  allowing the government to redistribute it according to need.  <br />Sound  good?  Communism failed.<br />I would personally like to thank each of my  employers for creating their businesses and offering me a chance to work  with them.  I hope that my contributions helped to make you successful.   The wages you paid me were fair, and I earned them honestly.  The value I  got was equivalent to the value I gave.<br />How great our country would be if  more people were willing to give credit where credit is due: to the  successful business men and women who employ us.	1998-12-21

I wanted The Magic Circle to be equally good, but it just ... wasn't.  Yes, it was enjoyable, but it wasn't up to her normally exceptional level.  I consider The Eight one of the best books I've ever read, and probably one of the best-written novels of the decade.  If I could write, I'd write like that.<br />I think The Magic Circle just got out of control.  Two story lines were superbly interwoven in The Eight.  Three were intricately crafted in A Calculated Risk.  Between Indian reservations and Austrian Schlosses and the Last Supper and Caligula and Salt Lake City and ski slopes... <br />Mozart pulled off a muddle like that in The Marriage of Figaro -- 20 voices all going at once.  The Magic Circle, though, became a cacaphony.<br />I will credit Katherine Neville with being an exceptional researcher and a wonderful writer.  And I enjoyed The Magic Circle, it was entertaining and a good read and hard to put down.  Fo! r any other writer, this would have been a magnificent achievement.  For Neville, I'll just read The Eight again and wait for the next one.  She's always worth a read.	1998-07-21
US	52771178	R3C5OT7Q5VX9GC	0449002632	479109259	London: The Novel	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Enjoyable!	This book was everything I expected: glimpses into different epochs; interesting scraps of information; a plot spanning millenia.  What kept this book from being a GREAT read was that there was no unexpected thrill, no frisson.  Too bad, because the reader invests plenty of time in the book.  However, it's great to read before your next trip to London.  Just bear in mind that the names aren't all THAT important and keep on reading.  Also, a word to the publisher -- make it easier to find the geneaological chart -- print it on the inside paper cover of the book.  I was always flipping through the maps to look up out who begat whom.	1998-07-21

Nabokov always crafts books with interesting twists, plays on words, and hidden foreshadowing, but PALE FIRE is possibly my favorite of his books.  It is wonderful -- an excellent story inside an excellent story inside an excellent story.  I read it twice straight through, and now I go back for a re-read every once in a while.  It is immensely satisfying.<br />If you are looking for an easy read, the top plot will probably be great for you.  But if you're looking for something more, this book HAS it!<br />Wonderfully intricate and very worthwhile.	1998-07-09
US	52771178	R3TW08GLRO32C9	0842305068	259845778	The New Dare to Discipline	Books	5	9	23	N	N	Strong discipline demonstrates strong love	The best thing you can teach your kids is how to grow up to be successful.  Not only does discipline affect your children's behavior when they are young, but it is instrumental to their development of life-long success habits.  The most loving thing you can do for your kids is discipline them consistenly.<br />This book not only demonstrates the necessity of discipline, but also gives concrete examples of how to discipline with love.  It provides results of psychological studies showing how a consistently loving and structured environment leads to healthy, happy, and outgoing kids, while the opposite approach leads to stressed, fearful, withdrawn kids.  But most comforting, it is a reference book to assure parents that they are on the right track.<br />This is well worth a read, and then several re-reads.  Even if you think your child is too young or too old to benefit from structured discipline, read it.  You may be surprised.	1998-07-08

Those people lucky enough to already have learned the logotherapy approach, even if new to the terminology, will find in the book a path to reassuring others.<br />Even if you've never given one moment's thought to  life's truths, this book will be meaningful for you.	1998-07-06

Finding ways to promote cultural diversity is a must in the business setting, and with that in mind, I dove into the book.<br />I was surprised at how viciously anti-white-male the first few chapters of this book were.  By the time the topic moved from ethnic minorities and women to people with disabilities, the attitude toned down somewhat, but I considered the first two chapters provocative and hostile.<br />It's a shame that a fine text about cultural diversity begins with such a high degree of discontent and anger.  Once the tone of anger subsided, the book was a worthwhile read.<br />I think the merits of the book, promoting understanding and non-discriminatory and non-stereotyped attitudes and actions in the workplace, were overshadowed by the *very* discriminatory and stereotyped view of the white male worker.<br />(I am not a white male)	1998-06-30

Once the book moved on to workers with disabilities, older workers, and foreign workers, I think the focus went off trying to rile up the potentially disgruntled workers, and the second half the book was well worth reading.  As a manager, I found the exercises and self-scoring evaluations valuable.<br />I would recommend the book to others, but I might also recommend that in future editions, it would be worthwhile to tone down the aggressiveness against white men in the first two chapters.	1998-06-27

It's great to read a book and be unable to predict the next twist.  Peter Blauner did his research and created a believable and realistic drug-dependent homeless man.

The real Bay Village is less rural and more friendly than the town depicted in this book, but the tone of the inhabitants seems about right.  <br />The story line made this book well worth reading -- the unexpected plot twists were great and the characters were very well-developed.<br />I really enjoyed this book and I have loaned it to two or three of my friends.

However, it lacked the character definition and storyline of a good novel and was not a satisfying read.<br />Voyage was disappointing in three regards.  First, while many of the characters had the potential to be well-developed protagonists, the reader is left with only a superficial understanding of Pendleton, MacLeod, Harwar, and Blanchard.  Their motivations remain only shallowly understood, even after nearly 700 pages.  Second is the philosophy of the book -- the idealists dream of Marxist Utopia while the capitalists clutch their wealth and status... a simplistic theme, and yet with such poorly drawn characters, the reader is certainly _not_ swept up in the struggle.  Third was the plot itself.  The reader waiting for developments is finally rewarded on page 400 with a promising plot twist, bringing the action to a boil, but the excitement is left to fade back into a tepid simmer.  While this was not the worst book I have read this year, I would not recommend it, even to someone who loved tales of the high seas.	1998-06-14

It moves right along and the plot keeps getting better.  I was *sure* I knew the identity of the killer at least three times in this book (wrong every time), and the ending was not one of those cop-out happy endings where nobody has any problems sleeping at night.<br />This book was better than the movie, better than anything I have read by John Saul or Dean Koontz, and well worth a re-read.	1998-06-09
US	52771178	R2AR17MK8QC7H9	0553289411	282856370	The Plains of Passage	Books	4	1	3	N	N	All right, already... let's move on.	At this point, *anyone* could write these books.  The Mammoth Hunters was about 30% review material from prior books, and Plains of Passage was easily 40%.  It's tiresome to re-read over and over about Jondalar's worries that he won't father a child.  Should Ayla tell him about her special morning tea, or not?  It's frustrating to keep rehashing old plots as the basis for new ones.  If you are interested in how Ayla and Jondalar got where they are today, read the other books!  For those of us who already know, we really want some more plot, please.<br />Regardless of these sentiments, I confess to being a complete junkie on these books.  I find them extremely interesting in the light of their historical accuracy to archaeolgical artifacts.  Yep, there's some sex, too, although it's pretty standard stuff, and for some reason, the idea of non-simultaneous orgasms must not have been around 15,000-25,000 years ago.<br />My predictions for the rest of this series: Ayla meets Jondalar's people and ends up being a head-woman of the Zelandoni, combining her spiritual and leadership abilities; along the way, she invents agriculture out of the necessity to have some crops nearby; Ayla invents archaic pictographic writing as a way of communicating across broad distances; Ayla bears a son to Jondalar, and that baby grows up and gets into conflict with Durc or his child, and the new ways overcome the old ways, fulfilling Creb's prediction, but Ayla can mediate because of her fluency in the languages of Clan and the Others;  Ayla discovers that yeast makes bread rise; Ayla perfects the wine growing processes of the Zelandoni (who over time become the Franks); Jondalar invents the bow and arrow and perfects the spear-thrower;  Jondalar has major anxiety over his early passion for his Zelandoni shaman but he doesn't tell Ayla because he's such a brooding type; love conquers all.<br />Sincerely, I hope Jean Auel will come out with the next book soon, because I'm dying to read it andI know that, flaws and all, these books ar! e still among my favorites.	1998-06-09

The Bible is complete, and as a book of philosophy, I have yet to find its equal.<br />I am not a crusading Christian.  This isn't about whether your religion is better or worse than mine.  This is about people believing, and reforming their lives because of, this book.  That is a dangerous practice to be part of, especially for those who are unaware of the differences between what this book professes and what the major world religions hold to be fundamental principles.<br />Check it out for yourself.

The historical story lines were very clever, but Dirk Pitt... he reminds me of the village lout Gaston in the Disney movie &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  <br />The pace of the story was good, and the ending was  pretty good, too.  But Dirk Pitt distracted me from enjoying the book too much.  I was very exasperated with the character.<br />When I think about it, I suppose that means I was drawn in by the book enough to be irritated with the character.  I have recommended this book to one of my friends, who got a big laugh out of it (he's the sort of friend who sees the lighter side of life).<br />All in all, though, I was disappointed in the book.	1998-06-05

As a kid, I read Watership Down over and over, so when I saw Maia, I suspected it would be good.  It is wonderful.  Just like in Watership Down, you pick up on an alternate language by osmosis.  <br />I am a big fan of David Eddings' books, as well as the Middle Earth books, and this has some of the flavor of those.

Usually Ms. Yarbro's books are exceptionally well-researched, but this one fell flat.  I thought the repeated use of certain Saint-Germain sayings (such as &quot;my...life&quot; and &quot;I give you my Word on it&quot; was a little cheesy and distracting.)    The most interesting part of the book for me was the poliyical intrigue surrounding the sale of arms, and I wish it had been better developed.    I miss the very detailed background nature that were in books like &quot;Tempting Fate&quot; and &quot;Blood Games.&quot;  All in all, an interesting book, and worth reading, but not an exceptional book.	1998-04-06
